0,I shouldn't have logged in,1301623560,"I didn't think nightmares could start digitally, but I was wrong.

I was comfortable in the darkness, in the shadowy depths of the Internet that was nosleep. I lurked in the back of people's minds, as perhaps only a ghost of a legend. No one really believed in me, did they? I was never revealed, only concealed. I crept in the shadows of people's bedrooms in the dead of night. I darkened the doorway in the corner of their eyes. I was the blackness that was in the reflection of the mirror but wasn't behind you.

I wore the black tuxedo to blend in, to stay within the shadows of the night, to camouflage myself within the fog that rolls in on nights when the moon was right. They might have caught me on grainy photos from cell phones when I let my guard down, when I was chasing someone, but not much more. I tried my best to stay in the quiet, to hide within closets, or to run through the forest.

No more.

There was a light, a terrible yellow light, that revealed me to the world. I lost my terror, I lost my fear. Even tearing children apart by the legs in front of their mothers doesn't seem to induce the fear I once inspired. Yellow, purple, blotches of color that should not be. My night has ended.

2,A little something to ponder.,1301620118,"This isn't really a scary story. Not yet, anyway.

I just wanted to let you know that I moved into the apartment my dad built for me not long ago and it has one very... interesting... feature. 

The bedroom has a walk in wardrobe. In said walk in robe is a concealed door which leads to a small recess in the wall cavity.  Dad designed the cavity as a hideyhole for me should anything happen. Robbers in the house, zombie-apocalyse? Into the hideyhole I go. He even suggested that I keep some canned food and a knife in there just in case. It's a good idea when you think about it. 

Except if someone else finds their way in there... They could be living in there or even just waiting in there, waiting for me to go to work or go to sleep. Maybe they would emerge, eyes blinking, into the daylight and sort through my things, maybe plotting, maybe just obsessing. Who knows? 

There's no lock on the concealed door. It's safety relies on the fact that you can't distinguish it from the wall surrounding it. So unless I check in there every time I get home (and let me tell you, I never remember to) I'll never know if someone or something is in there. Waiting.

Got an attic? A basement? A cavity in the wall? Some place that you never go in your house, some place dark, damp and hidden? You think about it. Who else could be living with you, waiting for their chance? Go on... have a little ponder.

3,Her Heart,1301619950,"A letter in a crisp envelope with a red stamp found between the bills and the advertisements.  The writing is small, formed with patience and precision.

""Hello.  It's been a long time, hasn't it, since it went so wrong between us.  I miss you, but I know that we're over now.  I'm not writing this to try to get you to come back.  We both know you won't.

I guess I don't blame you, given the woman you're with now.  She's perfect for you, perfect in all the ways I never was.  I've watched her from the cafe across the street as she works.  She's so kind to all her co-workers, so intelligent and apt at her job.  She's beautiful too.  How did you ever find someone so special?  I've stayed up the last few nights, thinking of you and making something that I hope is just as special.

She walks home, past the bakery, taking the same route every evening.  She always stops at this one news stand to buy a magazine.  What does she read?  Is it fashionable and witty, erudite and complex, transcendent or venal?  Why doesn't she take a cab?  She is five month's pregnant with your child, after all.  Then a few more blocks and she's back to the apartment you two share, and the meals and the time you share.  And the bed, of course.  You seem much more passionate in coitus when you're with her.

There's a place between the white and red buildings she walks past every night.  It's dark and quiet and there's rarely any people walking about.  I suppose she likes to walk down the streets alone, in the quiet, lost in her thoughts.  She should really pay more attention.  I worry about how easy it would be for someone to take her with a rag of chloroform or a blow to the head at just the right spot.

You'll think I'm terrible for this and maybe it's proof that you were right all along.  Maybe I do need help.  I just get so angry sometimes, about how bad things ended.  About how I can't seem to stop missing you.  I fantasize, sometimes.

I've made you five little boxes.  There's a blue one with a blue ribbon, a green one with a green ribbon, a red one, a white one.  And the gold box.  The gold box is the most special.  It's a little bigger than the others, like a shoebox made of gold and wood.  Just the right size for holding something valuable.

I would be gentle to her.  I know you love her and I wouldn't let someone as good as her feel any pain.  She needn't wake up to suffer.  This isn't her fault.

I'll make the first incision between her lovely breasts, peel back the skin and muscle, see her ribs revealed like the vault of a cathedral.  I'll watch her heart beat and think about those times we lay together in the dark, about the times you lay with her in the dark, two tired and flushed souls listening to each others' heart beat.  Then I'll continue the cut down her swollen stomach.

Your little child will be there in the fragile sack of the womb.  It's unfortunate that her lungs won't be developed yet, that she has to suffocate like this.  I'll put my finger on her gently to feel her pulse stutter and slow while I think about picnics and birthday parties, the first pet she would have had.  A whole life fading with her pulse, lost to the silence.

I will remove your wife's liver, her kidneys, her stomach, and the remains of her womb.  I will taste a piece of each.  Anything else would be disrespectful.  I'll put her liver in the blue box and place it on the northeast corner of the table, he kidneys in the green box to the northwest corner, stomach to red in the southeast corner, her womb to the white in the southwest corner.  Her heart I will burn in the fireplace so that the ashes might rise to the sky.  Your daughter will, of course, go in the gold box placed over where her mother's heart used to be.

And then I will cut my throat and you will be left all alone.""",nosleep,the_quietness,/r/nosleep/comments/gfyxz/her_heart/

8,"As requested, a Mirror Box story",1301616025,"This is a response to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gc86j/request_mirror_box_stories/).  I've gathered my thoughts, and here it is.  A mirror box story.  For those who don't know, [this](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Mirror_Box) is what a mirror box is.


It was my freshman year of college, at the University of Missouri.  I didn't have a real job yet, and was living with my parents (so much cheaper than the dorms, and roomier too).  I was taking a basic psychology course to satisfy a general education credit.  It was a huge class (most of the 1000 level 'Intro to whatever' classes are).

One day, when walking to class, I saw a flyer asking for assistants for an experiment.  I'm always a bit leery about psychology experiments, you never know what they're actually testing.  But this one promised some money and was only asking for assistants.  So i thought, what the heck, may as well.

I went to the professor's office listed.  I won't try to write out dialogue because it was a few years ago and I don't remember exactly what we said.  He told me he had one other student to help, and that we'd be paid $50 each to assist him with an experiment for one evening.  I told him that seemed like a lot, and he said it was a important enough that another $100 wouldn't matter to the department.  He asked a few questions, had me fill out a few pieces of paperwork and told me where to meet him two nights from then.

So I did.  It was a slightly older building at the southern edge of Mizzou's property.  If you've ever been in Columbia, you know how the University is practically part of the city.  Well this part isn't.  The building is off Rock Quarry Road, close to the forest.

I went inside, walked up the steps to the top floor and saw a massive box in a huge room.  The box was a bit taller than me, and had a lid on top, with a ladder leading up to it.  It looked to be about 5 feet wide on each side.  I'm not sure what material it was made out of (other than the mirrors inside of course, but I didn't know about those at the time).

The professor came out and briefed us on the procedure.  We were to help him into and out of the box, and no matter what we heard, we were not to open it until fifteen minutes had passed.  He was very adamant about that part.  We said okay, and at 10 PM the professor went down the ladder and I closed the top over it.

It was silent for a few minutes.  Then he started laughing.  Loud, almost goofy laughing.  The other assistant and I chuckled nervously, not sure what was going on.  The chuckles quickly turned to awkward glances as the laughter from in the box changed to moans of ecstasy.  Then, more silence.

At about 10:11 the professor screamed.  The loudest, most horrifying scream we'd ever heard.  We both hesitated and looked at each other.  But, he made it very clear that we weren't to open it until 10:15.  He kept screaming.  It got worse and worse.  Finally after a few minutes we couldn't stand it anymore and ran to help.  I got there first, flew up the ladder, ripped off the top and jumped inside.  The professor was gone.

I cannot and will not talk about what I saw in that box.  You wouldn't believe me if I told you, anyway.  I don't even know how long I was in there.  But I will tell you what I saw when I finally managed to climb out of that box.  Where the other assistant had been standing there was melted rubber, and it smelled.  There were two small trails of melted rubber leading away from the small puddles, which merged and turned into one trail of ash.

I don't know what happened to the professor or the assistant.  I ran out and never looked back.  But I do know I let something out of the box that night.

About a week later I went to the professor's office again.  There was a different name on the door, and when I looked him up in the school's system there was no record that he had ever existed.  I never spent the $50.  I ended up donating it to a local animal shelter.

Not long after that I transferred to Saint Louis, where I am now.  I go back to Columbia every now and then to visit friends and family.  But I never drive down Rock Quarry Road anymore.

9,Strange Dreams,1301601320,"This isn't actually scary -- it's more ... unsettling. And I should also warn you that I'm a terrible storyteller.


Everyone dreams. When I wake up in the morning I usually have no recollection of my dreams. It's not even that I have some vague notion that I dreamt and simply can't remember the details; It's like I didn't dream at all. But everyone dreams.


I grew up in 2 story townhouse with a finished basement. We were a big family: My grandmother, my mom and dad, two older brothers, an older sister, and me. Our house was always full and noisy and bustling with life. There were no dark corners or scary shadows. My brothers (both 10 years older than me) lived in the basement, and I shared a room on the 2nd level with my sister (who was 13 years older than me). This isn't significant, really, other than it gives you a glimpse of the type of home I grew up in. I didn't live in a creepy place and I wasn't surrounded by anything particularly dark or dramatic.


But back to the dreams ... Like I said, I rarely ever remember that I've even dreamt. Nevertheless, when I was 6 or 7 I had recurring dreams, the memory of which has stayed with me (I'm 24 now). The dream was short and didn't seem significant at the time, and, strangely, I wasn't frightened by it. 


I dreamt that I heard a voice calling my name. It was deep and gravelly, but not in a menacing way; It was rich like earth and forest and growing grass. I got out of bed quietly so as not to wake my sister and walked down a narrow flight of stairs. At the bottom of the stairs I could walk straight and go into a living room or I could turn to the left and walk past the dining room and into the kitchen. If I turned right I was facing the front door. I turned left. The kitchen had an open floor plan. To the left were all the cabinets, the sink, fridge, and an island; Directly in front of me was a breakfast nook with a round kitchen table, and sliding glass doors leading to a patio. All the lights were on even though it was late at night in my dream and everyone was in bed. I padded across the cold tile floor toward the sliding glass door. I hadn't heard my name again but I knew that something was outside and that it wanted me to let it in. I reached the door and opened it without issue -- it slid smoothly and quietly along its track.


Outside, in the dark, stood a bull. It wasn't half-human half-bull. It was just a bull .. but it stood on its hind legs like a person would. In that same deep voice that I heard calling my name, the bull said ""You will find the way out. She will not escape"" That's it. I don't recall ever waking from the dream and feeling scared or uneasy. The dream would just end there and I'd go on sleeping through the night. And I always remembered the dream in the morning. I had this dream 2 or 3 nights a week for close to 2 years before it finally stopped. I never mentioned it to anyone or thought anything of it at all. I guess I should also mention the house I was in in my dream wasn't the same as the house I lived in at the time, and it didn't resemble any house that I frequented.


The dream was always the same, up until the last one. In the last dream I found myself at the beginning of a labyrinth with my sister and the bull. The labyrinth was underground, lit by torches, and strange markings were carved into the walls. The bull said to my sister and me, ""You must go through the maze and the first one to find her way out is safe. The one left in the maze is mine. She will die."" I don't remember the details of the maze at all. And I don't remember feeling scared. My sister and I went our separate ways and I finished the maze first. The bull met me at the end and congratulated me, then the dream would end. That was it.  I never had a dream again (that I could remember) in which I heard that voice, or visited that house, or encountered a bull. 


Now, this may seem boring or insignificant. Indeed, I didn't think about it for many, many years. Fast forward to the fall of 2001: My sister was diagnosed with a terminal illness and passed away that December. Immediately I thought of the dreams ... what the bull has said, and that made it through the maze before my sister did. Then, in the summer of 2002 my family moved out of the townhouse I grew up in. I didn't see the new townhouse until the day we moved in. I was carrying in a box of something ... VHS tapes probably. I walked in the front door and almost dropped the box. I stood there with my mouth hanging open. To my left was a staircase, to my right was the living room. After the living room was the dining room, and at the back of the house was the kitchen and a breakfast nook with sliding glass door. I felt guilt and terror and confusion. I stood there until my dad cleared his throat and asked if I needed help with the box I was carrying.


Like I said, not scary. Just unsettling. 

TL;DR -- I rarely remember that I've dreamt at all, and as a child I had recurring dreams that I would survive but my sister would not. My sister died when I was 15.

In my sophomore year of High School, math class, probably around 2003: I was bantering with a class mate, and for some reason what I thought was just to be silly, I jokingly said ""I smell death on you."" I got odd looks but I was an odd kid, after that, the teacher told us to quit messing around. We got back to work and I didn't really think anything about it, I think it was a Friday, which would explain my weirdness.

Since accepting that fact (but not blindly!), I have turned elsewhere to share my experiences and ask for others'. I have obtained many terrible, or disturbing stories from trustworthy sources. I am not claiming they are fact, at all. I invite you all to view them with a skeptical eye, as always.

--------------

Most of us here can hardly remember a time before the internet. That was less than two decades ago. Some of us, can remember a time before TV. But how many of us can remember a time before all of these commodities? Or a time before light? When night was pitch black, and entirely mysterious. A time when tall tales didn't seem to tall, and when the Earth seemed vast, mysterious, and wild. A time before the encroachment, and the perpetual lights.

I wonder what was around back in that day. Before humans came along, time would pass unnoticed, and the land remained unturned. Everything was ancient, as old as the Earth itself. With our manipulation of our environment, things have surely changed. 

But we are lucky to be in these times. To have seen such a change. Because we are able to experience the greatest peak of humanity, and yet we can turn an eye into our past by asking those who were there to experience it. These stories have been told by those who saw the world in darkness.

**Turn of the century, Arizona, USA.**

My friend G's roots are from Arizona. As many of you know, that state has always been overrun by crime, drugs, death, and terrible things.

Around the turn of the century, when the outside streets were illuminated by gas, not electricity, G's great grandpa was walking back home from work. It was unusually late, about 1 am or so.

He always took the same path home, part of which crossed through the dark desert to get to where he actually resided. It was not a big problem, as it was routine. What was not routine, is to see a man wearing a black suit, a top hat, with a horse-drawn carriage behind him, waiting for him as he crossed his path. He was met with a polite smile.

""It's awful late to be walking home. Would you like a ride?""

G's great grandpa declined, being both too modest, and wary to take the offer.

""Are you sure? It's pretty dark out here."" The man flashed his polite smile again.

G's great grandpa thought about it a bit more carefully this time. It was indeed dark, the moon probably went behind some clouds or something, because he could not see very ahead of where he was. And yet, part of his mind was recoiling in a mix of disgust in fear at the thought of getting in this man's carriage. While pondering, he looked down at his feet.

Where the man's pants should be, are instead two long, orange stalks. Where the feet should be, the stalks end and widen into this flat, flipper-like orange foot. The feet of a duck.

G's great grandpa let out a whimper. His eyes welled up and his throat seemed to have a heart stuck in it. His mouth dried immediately. Trying his hardest to keep his mouth from quivering, he mutters a weak ""no"" and tries to get away.

The man with the feet of a fowl starts to cackle loudly, emitting the stench of sulfur. G's great grandpa runs as fast as he can while screaming for his life. In between his screams he hears these terrible slapping sounds and the man's laughter rising and twisting into a terrible duck-like cacophony.

He gets home safe, collapses. He is not seen in town for two weeks, as he is with high fever for two weeks straight. He never took the same path again, and feared the darkness of the desert forever. He claims he met the devil, or one of his minions that day.


**Early 20th Century, Kentucky, USA.**

This story is B's great grandparent's story. However, I got this story from a very close source: his grandma. The daughter of the couple in this story.

B's great grandma was in the kitchen finishing up lunch, while her husband was outside tilling the field. As she is setting the table, she hears a loud crash from the kitchen. She turns to see this thing protruding from the kitchen's entrance. It's long, pointy, and orangey. Immediately, she is terrified. Her stomach is in a pit and her heart in her throat. She remains silent. 

The protrusion lengthens, and from the door frame comes the body that this protrusion belongs to. It's man, normal height, with the head and beak of a stork. It turns its head to look at her with one very human, intelligent eye. It focuses on her, as bird's eyes do. She shrieks, turns her back on the creature, and run towards the yard while screaming for her husband. 

She reaches the back door to the yard, where her husband is waiting for her. He slams the door immediately after she exits. A second later something hits the door *hard* leaving a pointy dent in the top part. There is a small pause, after which this creature pecks at the door about five more times simultaneously. The door is basically destroyed, but it remains on its frame. 

Eventually, the husband found a weapon and entered the house. No one was there. They never saw the thing again, but the door was indeed destroyed by enormous, incredibly strong pecks.

------

G and B are my friends, but their grandparents have never communicated before. And yet, in the darkness of the past, they both witnessed men with the parts of a fowl. It's food for thought. We will never know what was around before we made everything bright and loud. Hell, maybe they are still around, just hidden. Who knows? But I'm glad I am in these times, when demons and ghosts are laughed at due to incredulity. It makes me feel a bit more comfortable. I don't know about you, but if it ever becomes common knowledge that demons and other entities exist, I will never live in comfort in my life.

I have another story that is of the turn of the century, and it involves a human-like entity with parts of an animal, but I have decided to scrap it due to time constraints, and to keep with the theme of fowl parts. However, that is yet another mention of strange hybrids.

If you like these, I have more. But once again - you will have to wait. Yes - I typed these out at work. :)",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/gfloz/bird_parts/
12,Maybe... Just Maybe...,1301573999,"A few years ago on my 20th birthday I was visiting a friend in my hometown, a place called White Settlement (a small suburb of Fort Worth TX). To set the scene we were sitting across the street from her house in the bed of my truck, which was parked on the right side of the street facing the legal direction. I was sitting on the passenger-side wheel well, her house as well as the house directly behind me were the 2nd houses on the block from my left. Across the intersection on her side of the road was a streetlight, that along with her porch light provided the only light this particular nite. Please forgive the long setup but I have every last detail of this nite burned into my memory, I'll try to keep it just to the specifics as best as I can.

At around 2am after a few hours of catching up, amongst other things, my friend headed inside of her house, for some reason or another that went unmentioned, for an extended period of time. As i sat in the bed of my truck, having a smoke, I turned to my left. No real reason, just blankly observing an empty intersection out of boredom when something catches my eye. I remember before I even had the chance to begin processing what I was seeing I got chills and since my birthday is in August I don't attribute this happening to the weather.

Across the intersection on the opposite side of the street I noticed at first what appeared to be shadows moving. These shadows then took a shape and made their way out of the surrounding shadows and diagonally through the intersection towards me and my side of the street. Upon entering the light I could clearly make out the shape of this being. It was approx. 8 1/2 - 9 1/2 feet in height but only roughly 3 feet of that was torso. If it had been standing completely upright its hands and feet would both touch the ground when in a casual relaxed stance. It didn't even really have hands or feet though, just shapes. The entity had no neck, the torso became the head, but there was what resembled a jaw structure. The best way I could describe this creature would be to say that it was made of darkness. I know that sounds ridiculous but it's the only real line of comparison I can draw. And in moved in such a way that made it seem quite frantic, even though it traveled at a slow pace.

Once this thing made its way into the yard behind where I was sitting it approached the house and placed what would be its hands on the roof. What happened next left me even more slack-jawed then the previous 30 seconds. Somehow the creature gripped the roof of the house with its ""arms"" and then rotated the rest of its body around in a front-flipping motion until its ""feet"" also came to rest on the roof. Once there it appeared to regain its balance and scurry over the roof into the back yard. Throughout various points of this beings travel I would feel at times that it would turn towards and observe me briefly, I can't really explain how or why I felt this way because at no point could I ever make out anything resembling eyes on its body.

I have a few reasons for posting this.

1st - I've only ever told maybe 2-3 people this story, mainly out of embarrassment and I'm interested to hear if there's any kind of answer out there.

2nd - After coming across this subreddit about an hour ago I found and began reading about a phenomenon referred to as the ""Slender Man"". Before that I had never even heard of anything supernatural resembling what I saw. Now granted my description doesn't match exactly with the slender man (no suit) but it was motivation enough to get me to write this post.

3rd - I believe deep down that I'm not crazy. I lead a fairly normal life, I have an associates degree, plenty of great friends, and I'm very socially active. I'm not looking to reinforce that point, but it wouldn't hurt me to hear some positive or helpful words considering I've lost sleep and at times questioned my well being as a result of this thing.

It's about time I contribute considering how much time I spend in this subreddit and the fact I looked at the clock and I could have sworn it was just 2am but it's now 5.
Anyways:

The other night I was laying in my bed in my parent's house (I'm in college) trying to fall asleep.  I was still laying on my bed awake facing out from my bed when I blinked and some sort of alien/monster/ghost was hovering or standing (I was too scared to move even my eyeballs lololol) about 3 feet away from me, about 6ft tall with illuminated green eyes.  I kept trying to convince myself it wasn't real, that I was dreaming and would wake up however nothing changed and I still couldn't move.  

I kept staring at it when I finally decided I would have to punch it to convince myself that it wasn't real - because if I punched it and it was fake my fist would go right through, then it would disappear - obviously.  So I mustered up all my courage and channeled my strength into swinging my arm out and I let out a yelp as I swung for it - But alas I was paralyzed.  I didn't even move at all and couldn't even scream, I only let out a sickening croak.  

As if the creature knew what I had just attempted, it slowly got larger and its eyes brighter and my heartbeat grew louder and faster and this noise I can only describe as the same stereotypical spaceship noise every crappy scifi movie uses grew louder and louder until it was unbearably loud and my heartbeat so fast my heart felt as if it were about to explode. 
Then I sat straight up faster than hell while letting out a yell.  And it was gone.  This was greatly relieving to me, but I still felt uneasy.    

It seemed to last for an eternity but I would say it lasted 10-20 seconds.

14,He is (Still) coming for me: Night two,1301554370,"Link to the night one: [NIGHT ONE]( http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gej8e/he_is_coming_for_me/)


Last night was horrible... Honestly I'm afraid to even write this so late in the day, seeing that it might just prompt him to show up sooner. I already know he broke the rules of his own game, and pulled me in to it without my consent, what says he can't decide to show up as early as 10pm? I hope I can wrap this one up as fast as possible... regardless... I don't think 


Shortly after posting my first encounter I began to prepare the materials needed to play the midnight game. I may as well already be playing his game already, But if I wanted to get this nightmare over with I figured I would need to win, regardless of the rules he decides to break, I still have to follow them. I had sent my dog over to a friends house in fear for her safety, and my parents are still over in Europe for another month, so the house is completely empty this time, Just me, and the Midnight Man tonight. So every piece of furniture has been moved back and away, giving me lots of room to run and maneuver around him if I happened to get trapped in the same room as him. As midnight fell, and I completed the 22nd knock, I knew that the game had started yet again, this time I was ready, I had my candle, and SEVERAL canisters of salt in a satchel, Which I really was hoping I would not have to use, seeing that the objective of the game was to not get caught or trapped.


Lighting my candle took way to longer than it should have. Tears of regret filled my eyes, it was so early in to the game, and it felt as if all hope was lost. I figured he decided to break another rule, and just get me now, than chase me around the house. I started to feel the chills, tho I was wearing a ski jacket (I have been very cold after the first encounter) 30 seconds of sheer terror go by, I could barely see the candle and the lighter I was holding due to the tears streaming from my face, but right before I thought all hope was lost, I saw an orange and yellow glow ignite in my hands, and felt the warmth of the flame from the tip of the candle on my face, the candle was lit! I slowly got up trying hard not to diminish the flame I was trying so hard to ignite, I proceeded to the living room, anywhere but where I was, I was there way too long and he was probably nearby. 


Upon entering the living room I noticed that something was off, It was too dark, I know I had turned off the lights but I don't think I have ever seen this room this dark. Thats when it hit me, The streetlight outside on had gone out since last night... It was as if the house was floating in a void, I could not see anything outside of the windows. I was alone, no one would hear me scream, or please for help if something was to go wrong tonight. Images of my mangled decaying body flashed through my head, if I was to perish here, no one would find me for weeks... parents are out in Europe, told my friend who is taking care of my dog that I was going out of town for several weeks. My thoughts of my demise were quickly broken, as I was standing in front of the tall dark windows, I noticed something move in the reflection. Something was slowly walking down the stairs behind me, he was here.


Not even looking, I sprinted across the living room past the stairs and in to the hallways, contemplating which room I should go to next, The kitchen was my next destination. As soon as I arrived I noticed my candle had gone out again, I ran for the stove and turned it on and lit my candle, safe for now. For the next hour, I spent walking in a loop downstairs, Kitchen, garage, living room, office, kitchen. It seemed to work for some time, up until 1:15AM. I was returning once again to the kitchen, as I was approaching the doorway, a dark and tall figure slowly walked in from the right side of the frame, he was there, and I was 5 feet from him. I slammed the door shut, turned around, and ran to the living room, and up the stairs to the second floor of the house.


My candle had gone out again, lighting it this time was not too much of a problem. Once doing so, I glanced over from the loft that overlooked the living area and the stair case, expecting to see him walking up those stairs. He was not there, but I got a very uneasy feeling that something was off. I left the loft behind me and walked in to the master bedroom. Thats when my stomach dropped, standing on top of the third floor staircase was the midnight man. I had no where to go, I could either stay in this room and try not to get cornered, or run past him, in to the hall and down the stairs back to the first floor... My candle started to dangerously flicker, and I knew that it was only a matter of time till darkness was upon me again. I could not bear the thought of being trapped in the same room as him, Run, I had to run. My candle flickering out, I began to run blindly in the general direction of the door to the hallway, catching my small toe on the side of the doorway, the pain was unbearable, after a few steps I knew that I had broken it badly but that was not going to stop me, I knew I had to keep running. 


I made it to the end of the hallway and top of the stairs and began to limp down them as fast as I could, knowing that he was right behind me. Halfway down I ended up slipping, it seems that the toe I broke just moments ago was gushing blood. After this I am not completely sure on what happened, I hit my head fairly hard on my way down, my vision was blurry, and I could not think straight, I remember trying to light my candle but it seemed to have snapped in half on the way down, and I was only holding a stump. As I franticly searched for my satchel full of salt canisters, I heard a creak at the top of the stairs. I look up in the direction of the noise, and I see him, standing there. My vision was fairly distorted, but I could of have sworn there was a grin of satisfaction on that face of his... That moment a predator knows it has caught it's prey... I started to crawl to the front door, slipping and sliding around in my own blood, I heard the creak of each step behind me, and knew that it was only a matter of seconds till he was upon me. Crawling I managed to stumble upon a salt canister, which I grabbed with one hand, and continued to franticly crawl away from the noise. I was within the reach of the door when I heard the final thump, he had reached the bottom of the stairs, and was a few feet from me. I reach up and manage to pull the heavy wooden door open, a blast of warm night air hits me, only then I had realized how cold my house had been. I manage to roll out of the house and on to the doorstep. I hear the footsteps more rapidly approaching I look up to seem him coming at me, and I go straight for the door handle, and pull it shut. I feel a loud thud against the door, I knew that was not going to stop him. Then I realized that I still had the canister of salt. I drew a line in front of the door, trapping him inside. I hear three loud thuds, and then silence. The streetlight flickered back on, my heart jumped, expecting to see him under it. But alas nothing, a sense of relief washed over me.


Up until the moment I looked at my right foot. The small toe that I had caught on the edge of the door frame as I ran out earlier had been snapped completely to the right, making a 90 degree angle from the edge of my foot. I could see bone and tissue, it seems only a little bit of skin had been holding it on. I could feel the fluids in my stomach churning at the site of it, and eventually, out of me. After spending a good few minutes vomiting, I decided it would be best to call an ambulance, and get some help before I bleed out from my toe...

I regret calling them... They are keeping me for a few nights, I have two broken ribs, a concision, and a freshly reattached pinkey toe. And as of 4am last night, I am stuck  in a hospital bed... I can not run... and it is 11:49PM as I finish this up... I think it may be the medication, but I hear something down the hall... it sounds like tapping...

It's so cold...

15,Nightly visitor ... then dissapears,1301552288,"Ok so I sometimes read the posts from this subreddit and thought I share a strange event I went through.

This happened about 5 years ago, I was at the time living in rural indiana after getting away from bigger cities.  It turned out life there sucked but I had a well paying commitment to stay for one  year so I made lemonade from lemmons ...

Although it wasnt really a dangerous place, most people wouldnt lock their homes or cars, there was some drug related gang activity that tied back to ""dealings"" with Chicago.

I rented a rancher that was outside the small town. Outside wasnt much ... fields, some forrest, things like that. Next neighbour was anbout 1/2 mile away.

Often at night there were animals running around, scratching at the door and things like that. Mostly racoons and foxes and what not nightly scavenger roams there.

Eventually the scratching got a little more and I kept checking outside but never saw anything other than little shadows rushing away. Fucking bastards kept me awake more than I had patience for.

Not just for that but also for the local gang related retards, I kept my M4 (for the non gun folks, thats the assault rifle most of the military uses, not a bear stopper but with several hits will dispatch anything on 2 legs) loaded by my bed loaded and ready to go. 

One night there was the usual scratching, running around on the deck  and then the back door rattled and eventually the rattling stopped in a bang, followed by slow sweeping foot steps. ""WTF? This isnt right!"" I thought and grabbed my M4 and listened ... 

The steps slowly made it through the house just to come closer to my bedroom, the door opened and there is a guy slowly coming into my bedroom, holding a crowbar. He is old, ragged, weird, stares right through me. 

I yell ""FREEZE!!!"" a few times but he doesnt say anything, doesnt stop, just keeps staring and creeps towards me. When he is 4 feet away I fire several rounds in his chest. He stopped, keeps staring then screams like a hurt animal, turns around and creeps slowly away the way he came. 

I was shaken and just froze there. Not sure how long I just stood there aiming for the empty doorframe, in case he came back. But he never came back.  There was a blood trail leading to the open backdoor, lock busted and more trail leading outside. After about 15 ft the blood trail ended in a bloody puddle. There was no more trails and no body. The amount of blood I saw was more than the average old guy can lose without dying or at least passing out. No car, nothing was anywhere.

I went back in the house, closed the door by nailing 2x4s across, barricaded the other door and didnt sleep for the next 24h.

I never reported this, didnt hear of anybody missing or anything from the next neighbours. I never slept well after that and relocated to a place in the little town. After the year was up I GTFO and havent had anything like that happening.",nosleep,readforit,/r/nosleep/comments/gfcau/nightly_visitor_then_dissapears/
16,The woman,1301545202,"Night time.  Needed a cigarette.  My yard is fairly open with just a few trees here and there.  The front porch is not long but it is wide so I generally pace back and forth.  I hardly ever wear a jacket when smoking.  I feel like the cold air evens out the toxic smoke settling in my lungs.

There's a neighbor's decorative streetlight just down the street.  I always stare at it, thinking about how a countless amount of light particles are traveling into my eyes.  I like to squint my eyes and watch the light bend up and down, left and right...it's like my personal light show in a sense.

It was quiet that night, despite the anger surfacing the clouds and the constant breeze.  A set of chimes could be heard from a distance.  I always listened to them, waiting for the chance that they might accidentally play a familiar song.  I was pacing back and forth, taking a drag here and there, when I turned around to pace some more.  I looked over at the light.

Both my heart and I stopped in our tracks for a moment.  I could feel a sensation run through my arms and it wasn't the cold weather.  Next to the streetlight was a figure, long hair, light skin, thin build.  Why anyone would wear a nightgown in this type of weather was beyond me.  No movement.  Just standing there.  Looking at me, or at least in my direction.  But she wasn't there earlier, so maybe she was a drifter.  But in my neighborhood, drifters never passed through.  It was a quiet neighborhood, hardly ever any strangers aside from occasional Jehovah witnesses.

I remember feeling like everything had stopped including the breeze.  The chimes were silent.  I couldn't look away because if I did that gave her the chance to move without me knowing it, and I wanted to make sure she didn't do that.  If she were to leave the light, how would I know she wasn't darting towards me in the dark?
I finished my cigarette and went back inside, locking the door, lowering the window blinds after making sure the windows themselves were locked, and returned to watching television.

I couldn't help but wonder if she was still out there and I wanted to check.  But I didn't want to open the door for the fear of her standing right next to it.  I decided to call the police and tell them a strange lady was standing outside by the light.  Gave them my address.  I heard their engines, the sound of their brakes, and through the gap between my window and the blinds I could see a blue light blinking through.  I bent a blind back and peered out to see some flashlights waving about, and very vaguely I could hear the sound of their walkie talkies chiming in.

Then they left.  Didn't call, didn't visit my house (I had given them the address) so I figured the drifter had moved on.

My living room, where I watch TV, is just down a narrow hallway from the kitchen.  Then before getting to the kitchen door the hallway turns to the left, which leads to the foyer and ultimately the front door.  The kitchen is laid out pretty basically with bay windows on one end and the fridge on the other.  The fridge is next to the sink which is below another window that I use to watch the birds while I do the dishes or prepare meals.  It's quite pleasant.

A beer was in order.  The drifter kinda freaked me out and I needed something to chill me out.  A cigarette wasn't necessary, and at this point I didn't want to go outside.  She had apparently left from the light if the cops didn't pick her up.  No telling where she was at this point.  The window above the sink doesn't have blinds.  There's a door in the kitchen that leads to my back deck.  Just outside the window there is a rather long set of stairs that lead from the deck to the side of my backyard.  I decided to flick the deck lights on just to make sure some weirdo wasn't in my yard.

She wasn't.

But her face was right outside my window.  Staring in at me.  A blank face.  No emotion.  Just a dreadful stare.  I couldn't help but yell.  I flipped open my cell phone, fumbled it around until getting a good grip, and kept the light on to make sure the woman didn't move.  The police were reluctant to come out again but I assured them there was someone on my property....someone strange.

After getting off the phone, I yelled from inside, ""Get off my property!""
Her face didn't change.  She turned and slowly walked away.  Down the stairs she went, fading into the dark.
The police arrived, knocking on my door.  I opened it.
""We got a report saying someone was trespassing on this property?""
""Yes, please come in,"" I said, only for the sake of having someone with me to be honest.  I told him what happened, about the woman next to the light, and then turning on the deck light to see her staring at me through the window.  He was jotting down on his notepad the details and told me a couple of deputies were walking around the yard.  I reassured him they were welcome to check the entire yard and the inside of the house, even though I knew she wasn't inside.  She seemed too frail to break a window.

They searched the yard for a good fifteen minutes and told me the lady must've left for good.  I was relieved but still a bit skeptical that perhaps she wasn't just waiting for them to go.  Maybe she was a crackhead or something, high on something, but surely I wasn't scared of her thin frame.  It was only the ghastly stare on her face that caused me to quiver.

I returned to the television, watched it for a moment, and decided I should go to bed.  The living room light was on.  The way it reflects on the television screen when it's not turned on is quite eerie in itself.  The screen went black.  I was also on my lap top, shut it down, and started getting up from the couch.  that's when I saw her standing in the living room, through the television reflection.  I yelled, looked over to her, but she wasn't there.  

She wasn't to be found in the living room.  That's when I yelled,
""Okay lady.  Fuck off, I'm calling the cops.  I can take you, you don't scare me.""
Nothing.  No movement in the house, no reply, just silence.  Eerie silence.

I searched the kitchen, no one.  I searched the hallways, no one.  The foyer, empty, even the dining room next to the foyer was empty.  Then I turned towards the stairway.  It was dark.  I certainly turned the lights on.  Now I was looking for this lady, ready to kick her ass!

How she got in, I have no clue.  I headed up stairs, just waiting for some crackhead to come running out or something.  Made it all the way up with no reactions, turned down another narrow hallway that led to my bedroom.  The door was cracked open.  I remember it being shut.  I always shut it, it's a habit.  The light wasn't on, so it was like peering into the unknown.  Was she right by the light switch?  Was she behind the door?  I slowly reached in the dark, flipped on the switch and swung the door open.  She wasn't in there.

Then suddenly I felt a pair of cold hands grab me by the shoulders.  I screamed in shock, and heard a hissing sound.  She pressed a pressure point and sent me to my knees.  I got away from her grasp and rolled on the ground, turning around to defend myself, only to see no one there.

My heart was racing, I began to sweat.  I called the police again.
""Okay she's in the house now, and I can't find her.  She keeps running away or something, I don't know!""

While waiting for the cops I kept talking to the lady, knowing she could hear me.  Telling her to leave, the cops were on their way.  I heard something shuffle around in the bathroom, so I instantly turned the handle and kick the door open hoping she was behind it.  The lights were off again, so I turned it on.  Nobody inside.  I swung the shower curtain open to find no one in there.  Turning around and walking towards the hallway, I saw her...in the mirror...staring at me...turned around to her and she wasn't there.  I was freaking the fuck out at this point.
Then I heard footsteps running from the stairway towards the bathroom.  Heavy breathing.  I shut the bathroom door and locked it.  She started banging on it repeatedly when a high-pitch shriek came from her.

""Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""

It was long and piercing, and she was still banging at the door.  I could hear her kicking at it.  The lock was strong enough to keep her out, even though at this point it sounded like she was throwing herself at the door.
And that's when it happened.

The lights went out.
I went to toggle the switch but they wouldn't turn on.  The banging stopped.  The breathing stopped.  Everything went silent.  I listened for her footsteps.  I waited anxiously for the cops.

Then it sounded like the air conditioning turned on.  But it wasn't.  It was the sound of someone breathing behind me, in the dark.  I turned around and punched, hitting nothing.  The breathing was then on the other side, behind me again.  I swung around and pushed forward, only to run into the door.  I jiggled the door knob but it wouldn't open.  The lights wouldn't turn on.

Another shriek, this time from inside the bathroom.  Banging on the walls, the door, the shower curtains began swinging back and forth.  The shower turned on.  The sink.  The cabinets began swinging open and shutting.
Then silence.  Again, eerie silence.  The shower turned off, followed by the sink, the curtains ceased to move, and the light turned on.

I was facing the door.  I slowly turned around to make sure nothing was behind me.  All I saw was an expressionless stare, her bloodshot eyes, and yet she was breathing very heavily.  And then something completely different.  She smiled.  The smile didn't go away.  It just stayed there with her stare.
Now she's in me.  She's telling me to type this to you.  She says you're next.",nosleep,lubmuhkitteh,/r/nosleep/comments/gf9yo/the_woman/

The Aftermath:

The day we spent wandering in the woods was mostly filled with conversation.  We were all hungry, having not eaten since the morning of the previous day. Conversation seemed to switch back and forth from the previous day's events, and our desire for food.

Sara still refused to talk about her discovery of Jill's corpse.  That said, she still wove an epic tale of her journey from finding the first portal through when we found her.  Her tale could be another 8 part set of posts.  In the interest of brevity, I'll just write out the important bits.

Sara told us that when she reached the first portal, her hat was snatched from her by a person she never saw.  She also mentioned that Chris had force-fed her some sort of small brownie, his hand forcing her to chew and swallow, much like giving a dog a pill.  She'd had hash-brownies in the past.  This was not one.  It was far stronger.  She didn't know what was in it, but she did say that it made her feel completely lucid and open to suggestion.  She had also said that Chris told her to eat every brownie she found as she traveled through the forest.  She admitted that when the suggestion was made to her, she was already intoxicated enough that she felt the need to comply.

Research that I've done recently has only suggested a broad variety of possibilities, ranging from marijuana to opium (or other opiate based narcotics/medications).

It's obvious that she had been drugged.  With what, I don't know.

Sara described a strong effect from the brownie on her.  She said she felt highly compelled to eat the brownie she found at the second portal, and even more with each subsequent portal.

Steve wondered what compelled her to shed her clothes.

Sara could only explain it as the power of suggestion.  She said that she had felt so drugged up that she wasn't able to refuse.  Some figure had asked her to remove the article of clothing, and she did.  As she removed more clothing, she felt even more drugged.  The fucking brownies.  To this day, I still wonder what they were laced with.  I have my suspicions, but no proof – and now, over a decade after the fact, it's not like we could do a blood test.

Apparently, when we found her, she had been bound for a good two hours before we showed up.

She also mentioned that she felt her wooziness was due to the drugs.  Even the morning after, she wasn't sure she was sober.  She just knew we were safe, so she followed us.  She mentioned that she also only vaguely remembered Steve at the time.  It wasn't until she saw him that her feelings for him came back.

When we eventually made it back to the original camp (which took some time, because when we finally found the road, we were about seven miles from the original camp), we packed things up and headed home.  Mike and I rode in my car, and Steve and Sara rode in hers.

As we drove out of the forest, we passed the lot where Chris's car had been parked. It was gone.  Had we actually killed Chris?  Did he survive?  What about Tim?

On the way out of the forest, Mike and I stopped at the ranger's station near the forest entrance and told our tale.  We gave our information to the ranger.  He told us to go home and that he'd call if he needed anything else.  He also mentioned that he'd be sending a search party into the woods to see if they could find anything.

Savage River State Forest is a huge place, and most of the time, we were either lost or just following instinct.  We hoped we were at least close to our locations in the woods.  The ranger did know the location of the throne-like rock formation that Chris had sat in.  He said he'd start there.

The two hour drive home was nearly silent.  Mike and I didn't really feel like talking.  The “From Dusk Till Dawn” soundtrack CD played on repeat in my Discman, linked to the radio in my old Ford Ranger through a tape-deck adapter.

As we got about ten minutes from Mike's place, he finally spoke.  “Did all that really happen?  I know my leg is fucked up, but I really can't believe we went through that.”

I pulled up to a red light just as Mike finished his question, and turned to look at him.  Solemnly, I replied, “Yes.  We did.”

Not another word was spoken for the rest of the drive.

The only other communication I got from anyone else involved the rest of the day was a brief call from Steve saying that he and Sara had arrived home safely, and that he was staying with Sara and her parents for the time being.

I mentioned to Steve that I had talked to the ranger and that he was going to check it out.  Steve seemed happy with that, saying that he had forgotten to stop, as he and Sara just wanted to get home.

***

A few days later, I got a call from the ranger from Savage River.  He accused me of lying to him.  He said he had thirty people combing the woods where I said we were. They found nothing.  The only thing he found that corroborated our story was the evidence of the cast and crew campsites – both were empty, but had been recently used.

He told me that in the woods, starting from the “throne” and spreading out in all directions, they found a few tracks, a few signs that people had been through the area recently, but nothing like what Mike and I had told him.  There were no fire scorches, no lashed trees, no chains, no carvings, nothing.  Most importantly, they found no bodies.

“Perhaps your friends just wandered off and went home,” He said to me.

“I haven't seen or heard from either Joe or Jill since we last saw them in the forest,” I explained.  “Joe lived alone, but Jill lived with her parents.  They haven't heard from her either.”

“Fine.  I'll file a missing person's report.”  The ranger seemed more annoyed than anything else.

“You might want to check with other local law enforcement, but I think Jill's parents already filed one.  If you're going to file one, file one for Joe.”

“Fine,” the ranger responded.  I was almost a little upset with the terse tone in the ranger's voice.  They had always been friendly and accommodating in the past.  After a little more brief conversation, the call ended.

About 45 minutes after I hung up with the ranger, Mike called me.  He had just gotten the same call.

***

I kept in regular contact with Mike, both of us checking the news for any stories regarding it.

Neither of us really found anything.  Mike once found a missing person's report for Jill, about two weeks after we got home.  Now, in my retelling of this story, I have been unable to find it.  Either it's considered a dead case, or she's been found, dead or alive.

Neither of us ever saw or read a news story about it.

***

About a month after the events of the film shoot, Mike, Steve, Sara, and I all met up at a local Irish pub, Mick O'Shea's, to talk about the events.

Really, there was nothing new to tell. Sara had started seeing a shrink.  Steve had started a martial arts course, which he called “a wonderful stress relief – breaking all those boards and sparring.”

Just as the evening was almost over, but before we departed the pub for our respective homes, Sara mentioned one more thing: “Tim forced my hand in carving out Jill's heart.”

With that kind of bombshell dropped, we moved outside into the warm summer night. We walked towards where Mike and I had parked in a wide side street near the pub. There was nobody else around, as it was still before “last call”, even though the street was packed with cars.  We didn't want the following conversation to be overheard.

“He forced your hand?” I asked, horrified.

“Yeah,” Sara started, “I had already been drugged, so I was easy to manipulate.  I was already scared after seeing Jill's body the first time.  Just after Tim pulled off my jeans, he placed a large knife in my hands, wrapped his hand around mine, and forced me in the motions that cut Jill's heart out of her chest.”  Sara started to cry, burying her face in her hands.  She was unable to continue.  Steve put his arms around her, pulling her close.  She buried her hands and face in Steve's chest and cried louder.

“Steve,” I started softly, “Get her home.  Take care of her.  She needs you.""

Steve just nodded in agreement.  Without another word, Steve and Sara walked off. I didn't need to hear any more.

Mike and I stood in silence for a few minutes, briefly exchanging concerned glances.

Finally, Mike spoke.  “Chris's car was gone when we left.  I think he's still alive.  I'm not sure this is over.”

***

In the following weeks, months, years, Mike, Sara, Steve, and I grew apart.  Never again was anything said about the horrific events that took place in that forest.

The last I spoke to anyone involved, nobody had seen a news story regarding it. The best I could tell, the local authorities looked at it as a missing person's case. Cases like that are often never publicized, particularly when they happen in a huge wilderness area where it's not uncommon for the occasional person to get lost, go missing, and die from exposure, bear attack, or other such thing.

I think the last time I had contact with anyone involved was with Mike, back 2003 sometime.  When we spoke that time, neither of us mentioned the events.  I had largely blocked them out, and I think he probably had as well.

***

The more I think about it, I just recalled a story I was told by the proprietor of one of the two general stores in the forest, when I was camping out there four years ago.

She mentioned that a body had been found in the forest, not far from where I think we were.  It was badly decomposed, and nearly a skeleton.  The skull was missing. Marks on the bones were consistent with a bear attack.  She didn't know anything beyond that.  What little she did know was pieced together from conversations with the ranger and other locals.  None of it can really be considered reliable.  Again, I've found no news stories regarding it.

***

Tuesday night, after I posted part 8, completely out of the blue, I got a message on Facebook from Tim's sister.  I had barely ever even met her, but she remembered me.  Apparently one of her friends is a reddit lurker and saw the story, and then alerted her to it.

She has asked that I not post her words online.  What she told me was too much to withhold.  I'll paraphrase.

Tim has been in Taylor Manor (a local mental hospital) for the past 11 years.  He was placed there shortly after his return from the trip.  He was spouting all sorts of crazy shit (it made no sense to his sister, but some of what she said made sense to me), and seemed to be particularly violent after returning from the trip.

His sister said that he was doing well under extreme sedation, but wouldn't likely be able to ever live a normal life again.  He had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.

***

What happened to Chris?  I've never heard a word about it.

***

**Update:**  I just heard back from Tim's sister.  What follows is a copy/paste of what she wrote.

&gt; I just spoke with my father.  He informed me that Tim was released on Monday.  He is staying with my father on his farm in Cecil County.  He will be visited by state social workers twice a week.  He is still under heavy sedation, which my father has been charged with administering.  My father said he was also advised to maintain his fence around the property, just in case Tim tries something stupid.  Tim is not better, but he's lucid enough to be home.

In the story I think his friend died or something, I'm not totally certain. Also, I think the main character started seeing things while he was at home.

19,The Cycle of Miss Skinner,1301534437,"Billions of years of beasts hiding in the darkness and plucking away at our ancestors has planted a seed deep in the mind - to avoid those that that hide there. The modern world has made us forget that, to those that still hide in the dark, we are all still made of meat.

Miss Skinner watched TV from a dark door frame. She started to feel a bit like meat – a lone scared human in a cold and dark house. She headed to the kitchen and clicked on the kettle on. The steam hissed. She reached for a cup as the front room door slammed shut. She shivered. 

Miss Skinned turned to watch her back, leaning against the worktop and holding it for support. She heard another slam. She held tighter and added extra sugar. And another. And another. She quickly carried it through and reached for the front room door handle. 

Something heavy slammed the other side.

A weak muffled voice spoke in hurried tones as a bright white slithered under the door. The light rose. Miss Skinner jolted back as the door cracked open.

A scorched figure lurched from the blinding light. A steady flow of blood followed. A blade bleeding light jammed into Miss Skinner. She grabbed her stomach and groaned.

The figure advanced from the blinding light. She looked into its eyes. She froze. She was looking into her own eyes - watching herself move on her. A copy. A Twin. A monster disguised as herself.

It lunged. The blade gouges. She yelled. The dophelganger lashed out. It sliced her leg deep and she hit the floor with a scream.

Miss Skinner crawled back as the monster staggered forward.

“You cant keep coming!” it yelled as held it's bleeding stomach, ""I killed you!”

Miss Skinners kicked out. The monster swung for her. Miss Skinner kicked again. 

“I'll kill you all,” the twin groaned.

Miss Skinner took another blow. She grabbed a pan strewn to the floor. She flailed wildly as the blade stuck her shoulder. She struck the pan out and staggered back. The knife stuck in her. She moans and slid it out.

The monsyer backed in to the front room. Miss Skinner lunged forward. The door slammed shut. Miss Skinner yelled. She stuck the blade out. It plunged deep in the monster's chest. It spluttered and fell by her feet.

“You fucker,” it wheezes, “how can I...”

It ended in a lifeless hiss.

Miss Skinner shook as blood rushed from her wounds. She backed from the dead body of herself as  light rushed around it and the room engulfed in light. Miss skinner fell on the door. She grabbed the handle and pulled, peering into the new darkness. A figure stood still.

She yelled and blindly stabbed it's gut. It struggles and she gouged it's leg. It fell to the floor. Miss Skinner advances and yelled, holding her stomach,

20,Holy Fuckballs /r/NOSLEEP D:,1301533932,"When I read these stories, which are really interesting btw. I don't really believe most of them. And am not scared. So skip ahead a few hours today, reading...reading... Then my mom asks me to go outside to my grandmas house to get some stuff she needs for cooking. And as I step outside, and please note this is a really creepy place at night. The sparse streetlights are old and dim, and some even flicker. And they are right next to this dense small area of woods. Okay, now that you have a general idea of what the place is like I will continue. Alright, so I am walking down the road to my grandma's house, which is the road next to the forest and with the old streetlights. Slowly but surely my imagination kicks in. I keep looking behind me. Thinking I am being watched. I can swear I heard things in the forest, and was being watched. And to make it all worst, by the time I get near my Grandma's house I look upon it with dread, cause it is covered in shadows and my imagination kept telling me I was looking at slender-man or some other shit. Needless to say I was scared as hell. So I go up the drive way and the whole house is dark. Not a single light is on. It was rather uneventful inside, even though I was creeped out by the empty house. (She wasn't home at the moment.) When  I got out (which seemed like ages) I ran home. And when I finally got inside I was so relieved. I will probably have a horrible night now. Thanks alot /r/NOSLEEP :(

Me:  [via facebook]  I’m great, here’s my email: ______  . I just wanted to ask you about something but no hurry to reply, enjoy your vacation :-P

[Fucking forever and a day later…got him on gchat this time]

Me:  Hey!  Long time huh

Sent at 10:21 AM on Tuesday

Jay:  Yea very long!  

I bet I know what you wanted to ask and the answer is Sorry, I have no idea… heheh

Me:  I’m not sure what I was supposed to be asking :-)

Jay:  damn.  guessed wrong…  

I figured you wanted to know if Sara’s fetususus was going to be a boy or girl

Me:  Ohhhh… no I know they want that to be a surprise

You’re going to be the fun uncle!

Jay:  Hell no, I’m going to be the hot uncle

Uncle Jesse

you thought he was dreamy

Me:  Heyyy… shut up

Everyone and their mom thought he was dreamy

Jay:  yea yea but I saw you scootch a little closer to the tv whenever uncle Jesse came on 

Paying a little closer attention to the trials and tribulations of the Tanner family…

Me:  lol

Okay maybe

So is Sara doing fine then?

What is she, like 6 months?

Jay:  She is perfectly fine, and no it is 8 months now

Me:  Whoa, time flies

Jay:  I feel the same way, its like I found out just the other day and I keep losing track of time because I only see her once a month or less now

She is actually not that big yet, but thats cuz she’s a string bean to begin with :-P

Me:  Oh good

And I also wanted to ask how your dad was, I heard he needs eye surgery?

Jay:  Yea he started developing a cataract like our grandpa had only not quite as bad yet

hopefully that gene skipped me or something…

but he will be fine, they might put in a fake lens

It looks like a mini boob implant lol

Me:  hahaha really?

That’s cool

I just looked it up, you’re totally right!!!

Jay:  Heheheh told you

I told my dad he’s getting an eye job

hhmmmm

That sounds wrong in retrospect

Me:  lol

Okay well I haven’t asked you my main question that I wanted to ask

Jay:  heheheh for some reason I just got that guilty feeling like when you get called to go to the principal’s office even though you know you didn’t do anything wrong

Am I in trouble?

Me:  hahahahah no

Sorry I gave off teacher-vibe there

Do you remember when grandpa died?

Jay:  yea 

it was the first death I experienced

you know.. of anyone close to me

I was only like 8 yrs old

do you remember at all?

Me:  No I was only 3 

But my question is… did you have any weird things happen after he died?  Like not easily explainable things?

Jay:  Like did I freak out?  Or like paranormal things?

Me:  I don’t want to sound stupid, but yes paranormal things

Jay:  I don’t remember specifically, but my mom told me something weird…

He was supposed to go to some school play thing I was in and when I was getting ready to go to school I mentioned to my mom that grandpa told me in the dream I had last night that he’s sorry he wouldn’t be able to see my play.  Like 10 minutes later my mom got a call from GG [Jay’s name for Grandma G.] in tears saying he’d died in his sleep.  

Me:  Crazy

Jay:  but like I said… I don’t remember that because it was all a blur for me, you know?

why do you ask?  Did something x-filesy happen to you?

Me:  Something Mulderesque, if you will

Jay:  heheh

Me:  Yeah, actually

It’s really weird

Jay:  Do tell?

Me:  Okay

So about two weeks ago I was remembering when we moved into the new house.  My distance vision sucked at the time, but I hadn’t gotten an eye appointment for awhile so I didn’t realize there was anything wrong with my vision.  On Easter, Grandma G. had sent me and Casey some Barbies and Casey wanted to get out of bed late at night and play with them.  We were on the floor, and all of a sudden we see dad standing at the door…and I smiled at him innocently but I totally knew we were in deep shit for being out of bed and playing.  But he just turns calmly and walks away from the door.  I was excited that we didn’t get in trouble, and turned to Casey with a grin but she was stuck staring in fear at the door and I said “I guess dad isn’t mad…” and she whispered to me “That man wasn’t dad…”

Jay:  pissed myself there [MyopicBliss]

Me:  Oh, we’re not done yet

Jay:  Jeeeesus

Me:  Needless to say we freaked out

But I was thinking back and there were times when I thought dad was looking at me from another room in the house, but it didn’t seem like dad… I couldn’t tell for sure since I didn’t have glasses yet.  I always thought it was just me, but then I talked to Casey about it and she said she thought she saw dad once and ran to ask him if she could have cookies and stopped when she realized it was the same man from our room.  

Jay:  whaaa

Me:  So since I never saw him in detail, all I could tell about him was that he was thin and frail, but she said he had gray and white hair and white eyes.  I told my dad about the whole incident but he couldn’t think of anyone who it could be, the previous owners were still alive and in a retirement home and there were no old crazy people wandering around the neighborhood.  Then he mentioned about your dad having a cataract and that grandpa had them in both eyes.  At that point I completely freaked out and put 2 and 2 together.  Me and Casey didn’t even know Grandpa had cataracts

Jay:  Yea he always wore sunglasses for us to hide his eye probs

That is just crazy

And Grandpa was really skinny by the way

that must be where Sara gets her skinny genes from

wow

damn.

Me:  Well that’s why I was wondering if you (or Sara possibly?) remember anything weird happening

Jay:  hmmm

Yea something odd other than my mom’s story about me having a dream happened once 

Me:  Really?

Jay:  yea but I never thought of it as ghostly or anything

Jesus

not until now anyway

I have goosebumps up my legs

Me:  So what happened?

Jay:  Well my mom had taken Sara out to that little horse ranch for riding lessons

That was when she was about 12, so I was 10 and you would have been like 5

Me:  Ohhhhh  I remember Sara getting those horseback riding lessons

She was pretty much my idol

I was convinced she was a secretly a princess or something lol

Jay:  Heheh yea I remember you followed her around a lot

That day her and my mom were out but my dad was home somewhere because it was the weekend

Sara had this really detailed Wizard of Oz Puzzle

And for some fruity reason I absolutely freakin loved the puzzle, but I didn’t want anyone to KNOW I loved it because that was weird and girly

Me:  ahahahaha

Jay:  come on, I’m normal now :-P

Me:  sure

Jay:  I happened to be passing by Sara’s door and the puzzle box on her shelf caught my little eye

so I snuck into her room and grabbed it and smuggled into my room like a ninja

I guess I was really bored that day

but I figured hey, it would be like a race against time to finish the puzzle and return it to her room before I got caught with it!  :-P

Me:  lol

You troublemaker, you

Jay:  I’m doing the puzzle, putting together the little oompa loompas and shit

Me:  lol… munchkins?

Jay:  whatever

and I get the whole thing done except for the lollipop guild dude’s face 

the piece is missing

I look all around, under my bed and in the box, etc.

sneak back down the hall into Sara’s room, look around the shelf 

but no luck

I go back to my room, but I was only gone for maybe a minute at this point 

And the fucking piece is there laying right next to the puzzle in plain sight

I KNOW that piece wasn’t there before, I had looked all around my room

Then I got a little paranoid that my dad had known I was doing the puzzle and had found the piece and was trying to help, or was just messing with me… but he was downstairs napping

It isn’t x-filesy I suppose, but I got just the weirdest feeling that I was being messed with 

like that feeling you get when someone is watching you

You know? 

Me:  I know what you mean

That’s weird but not unexplainable, it could have been stuck in your clothes and fallen off when you stood up or something

Jay:  yea yea thanks for TRYING to make me feel better

Now I keep looking behind me suspiciously as I’m typing

Me:  hahaha I know that feeling too

Jay:  That is some crazy stuff

 I’ll def tell Sara about it when I visit

Gotta go now though

I’m at work 

Me:  Time thief!

Jay:  thaz me

23,Following the black widow,1301527713,"I was fourteen at the time, and I'd already had a few experiences on the paranormal side, but this one was the most substantial and The one where I was most exposed. It also happened alone and in the dark.

I'd spent a lovely evening talking and laughing about teenage stuff with my friend and I eventually embarked on my walk home alone. I lived about ten to fifteen minutes from my best friend and it was about ten or 10.30pm when I set off - this was very late for me. 

The air was crisp and traffic was very slow. In my old town this is the time when people are either cosily locked up in their homes, or enjoying the last hour before 'last orders'. There were streetlights every few hundred metres apart but most houses had their lights off.

I technically only lived three streets away; a short road, a longer stretch and then into my cull-de-sac. As I came near to the top of my friends street a figure appeared from a side road in front of me. she's on the same side of the road.

I say 'she' for two reasons. Firstly, she was dressed head to foot as a lady from the Scottish Widows adverts here in the Uk (Google it). - today, I'd more likely associate her attire as a woman wearing a floating burqa. I don't think even one family in my small town dressed this way and i certainly had never seen this before, and never did again for many years after that for that matter. Secondly, I just 'knew' she was a woman. I also just 'knew' she wasn't from this world.

My goosebumps had already started to raise on my forearms but at this point, my rational brain told me that I was bound to be unnerved by anything unusual while alone in the dark.  I kept a safe distance and kept my eyes transfixed on the sashaying figure in front of me. My body was on full alert and I can still remember my adrenaline levels building and building until I felt a constant buzz in my fingertips.

As she turned to her right, around a tall hedge and into the second street, I still remember imagining she had just stopped dead in her tracks and was waiting for me on the other side of the hedge. My heartbeat started racing and I edged sideways until I was practically in the road.

As I came around the corner she had definitely dropped her pace and was considerably closer than before. At this point I was just glad i hadn't come face to face with her.  I slowed down my pace which made me realise that this agony was going to last even longer.

Slowly she walked past the first of two churches, which happened to be along this route. A streetlight lit her up so I could see all the dancing folds and ripples the wind was making in her long black shawl/coat.  I couldn't see a shadow though and this made me panic. I wanted to check to see how my shadow appeared behind me as I passed the light but I couldn't bring myself to take my eyes off her. 

Apart from feeling the bile rise in my throat and the sweat dripping off my clenched fingers, nothing happened for about three or four minutes. The only thing I can remember is that she didn't go down any of the side roads that we passed and I was disappointed each time. 

I considered running really fast past her and hoping for the best but I really didn't want to get that near to her. Not a single other person had passed us. Not a single car had driven by.

We started to approach the second church and she upped her pace a bit.  I stayed at the same pace and watched her intently.

She was approaching the pathway between a school building and the church. 

Just as she turned into the path, a car's headlights emerged slightly on a bend in front. Other human beings were still about - heaved a huge sigh of release.

The car slowed down as it came around the corner and towards us.  The headlights were directly ahead now and I squinted.  What I saw in front of me will always chill my bones. I still saw the wind ruffling her coattails, But the headlights were shining directly through her dark murky figure. This seemed to last for an eternity.

The car finally passed and the lady had started her walk towards the church.  I hung back and gave us a little more distance.

I felt a burst of energy and my legs just took off. I never have, and never again will, run that fast in my life. As I came parallel to the path my head swung to look at her and she was just standing there, facing me. Although there was just a black figure, I knew she was looking directly at me.

When I finally collapsed on my parents front porch, banging and kicking to be let in, my throat was burning from the rush of cold air to my throat. I couldn't speak for a few minutes.

It took me a long time to make that trip at night alone again. ",nosleep,Theskyishigh,/r/nosleep/comments/gf3ct/following_the_black_widow/
24,Last night,1301527528,"If I'm honest, I'm still not entirely sure if this place is meant for fact or fiction, however I’m feeling a little shaken up at the minute and I’m hoping that this is the right place to post. I’m actually a highly sceptical person (and proud of it) but given my situation I’m finding this a real test of my strength, so I’ve run to the Internet for reassurance. I also apologise for the length of this account but I didn’t want to skip over anything that could be useful.

Before I go into last night, I have to explain something about myself. Initially this will sound completely irrelevant, but before you can offer advice you really do need to know this stuff. I am, and always have been, a lucid dreamer. To those of you who have no idea what that means, Wikipedia says “A lucid dream, in simplest terms, is a dream in which one is aware that one is dreaming.” [Full article available here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream) for those more interested. It’s kind of cool, kind of not, but that’s a different topic for a different time...assuming I’m given such an opportunity.

Anyway, the lucid dreaming itself isn’t important; in fact it’s the failure to lucid dream that’s the important part here.  Generally, I’m quite happy to stay within a lucid dream, but every so often I completely lose control of what’s happening, and wake up....at least partly. I found out around a year ago that it’s an officially recognised condition that’s known as ‘sleep paralysis’. To try and summarise it as best as I can, it’s a nasty little condition where the mind wakes up, but the body doesn’t. Essentially, it’s a brief taster of what it’s like to be fully paralysed, and it’s horrific. Imagine suddenly waking up one morning, to find you can’t move, at all, not even open your eyes. As if this alone isn’t enough to seriously ruin your morning, because your mind is still in a vulnerable post-dream state, it’s common to experience massive bouts of paranoia that manifest as that well known feeling of being watched by someone, or something. From personal experience this can last anywhere between 3 seconds and 20 but it sure feels like longer at the time.

Sound like the script for a crappy horror movie? Well as cliché as it sounds, [it’s real  and it’s truly terrifying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis#Symptoms_and_characteristics). There’s various research that points towards sleep paralysis being the real cause behind a lot of late night paranormal tales. Perhaps the most obvious of these being the multiple accounts of waking up to find yourself pinned down by a Succubi demon. It’s taken a while to get here but hopefully you now see why I thought it was relevant to bring this up. 

Keeping this in mind, I’ll actually get on with last night. University and such is causing me huge amounts of stress right now, so it’s unsurprising that last night my mental focus wasn’t so great and I slipped straight out of my dream and into a sleep paralysis. I think it was about 15 seconds before I managed to regain enough body control to twitch one of my fingers and snap out of it, but I should explain here that whilst the movement comes back 'quickly', the paranoia stays much longer. Despite being able to move, I often lie perfectly still for a good 10 minutes after I regain my movement, trying to regain rational thought and push the notion of anything else being in the room far out of my head. As a young man of 20 that’s not an easy thing to admit, but unless you’ve experienced something similar you have no idea just how terrifying the ordeal can be.

Last night was no exception and I lay there, too scared to move, for what seemed like an age. Obviously with my eyes shut it’s pretty difficult to see any form of timekeeping device, but I’m pretty sure I lay there much longer than my “average freeze time”. To be honest, just as I was preparing to move I convinced myself I could hear the faintest of tapping sounds in the background, following which I lay still for twice as long again. Until the early hours of this morning I didn’t believe there was anything worse than lying still amid a deathly silence, but something about that rhythmic “ticcy tacky” noise really got inside my head. It was far too quiet for any real movement, probably just the pipes or something, but at the time it sounded like it was coming from within the room, not from within the walls.

It’s also worth noting that I woke up with my head facing towards the wall. This sounds like such a trivial thing to highlight, but when you’re that convinced of something in the room, it makes things 1000 times worse. At least facing forwards you can subtly squint to survey the room, assessing potential dangers before moving, but with your back to the room there’s no way of checking anything  without first rolling over and having a look. You have to assume that if something really was there, rolling over and staring at them would give the game away somewhat, so waking up in this position can greatly prolong the situation. Taking this into account, along with the fact that my minds blown from all the uni stress, I guess I can understand why the paranoia stuck around for so long, and why it even expanded into auditory effects, but even so, I don’t think I’ve ever suffered paranoia for such a large length of time before.

When I finally did summon the courage to roll myself across the bed and check out the room, there was, of course, nothing. No signs of entry, no signs of anyone having ever been there and, most importantly, no actual entities in my room. Heart still racing, but fear mostly overcome, I managed a good 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep after that, for which I was extremely thankful. This morning, however, I’m not feeling quite so safe.	

Like many of us who “live on the internet”, I have a terrible habit of leaving my laptop on all night, beside the bed, so when I wake up in the morning I can get straight to checking the 3 main sites (Reddit, Facebook, Gmail). I know it’s a tragic waste of electric, but the convenience is too great a temptation for me but other than that I’m pretty energy conscious. Anyway, back to this morning, I poked at the touchpad and as expected the screen kicked back to life. My main motivation was of course to whine on Facebook about what a terrible night I had, but it quickly became abundantly clear that at some point between when I went to bed, and when I woke up, someone took the liberty of leaving me a message. Within my URL bar I found, “it hurts to be ignored, it hurts us both”.

As you may guess, this has left me more than a little freaked out, but I’m sure it’s just a clever prank from my housemate before they went back to their parents, right? Or my lucid dreaming has evolved into some form of sleep walking? More importantly, what the hell does, ‘”it hurts us both”, even mean? I’m trying hard to play this down, but I’m really not sure that I can sleep on my own tonight. On the other hand I can hardly ask to share a room with someone based upon a possible threat from a paranormal entity, that’s ridiculous. I’ve never seen an account similar to this before, neither from the sceptical community or the paranormal groups. I don’t know what to think.

It's midnight now and I'm sat here with the lights on, looking for a little reassurance before i try to sleep. Another busy day tommorow but I can't bring myself to sleep right now  :/

25,The Thunderstorm,1301525748,"With thunderstorms being such a prevalent theme in tales of horror, I was reminded of this memory from my childhood.  It's not so much scary as it is creepy - even creepier because to this day, I have not been able to find out what natural phenomenon would have caused this.

I was five years old at the time, and this is one of the few vivid memories I have from that long ago.  It was the early spring of 1981, and I lived with my family in a small Cape Cod style bungalow on the edge of the Baltimore City limits.

Out back, we had an overhead cable run between two trees, with a rubber coated steel cable hanging from it, attached to a pulley.  It was a run for our family dog, a sweet (albeit stupid) beagle named Becky.  She was not attached to the run at the time.

This particular evening, a thunderstorm raged on outside.  Now, even at such a young age, I was fascinated with thunderstorms (I still am to this day), and was sitting on the screened-in, covered porch out back watching the rain and lightning, and listening to the thunder.

Then it happened - the first time lightning actually scared me - it struck in my back yard, about thirty feet from where I was sitting.  Actually, it struck the overhead line, traveled across the line, down the leader, and into the ground.

The light was brilliant and the sound was deafening.  I started to cry out of fear, but the crying quickly subsided once I saw what the lightning strike had done to the yard.  The grass had turned electric blue.

Almost immediately afterwords, my parents rushed out onto the porch.  I could hear my baby brother (he was two at the time) crying from inside the house.  

My mother stared at the lawn, not knowing what to make of it.  She was mesmerized for a moment, but quickly ran back inside to get my brother and try and soothe him.

My father surveyed the lawn for a moment in shock.  He had never seen anything like that - none of us had.  ""Holy... shit..."" left his lips before he came back to reality and realized I was still sitting there.  That was the first time I had ever heard my father swear.

He called back inside the house to tell my mother to call the fire department.  Then he checked me to see if I was alright.

I was fine.  The fear and crying had passed as soon as I saw the electric blue grass.  I could hear my mother inside on the phone with the fire department.

Now, being so young and still so fascinated with the mundane world, I was truly excited - freaky colored grass... and a FIRE ENGINE!

About ten minutes later, a fire engine pulled up in front of the house, and my father and I went out to greet them.  Mom was still inside tending to my brother.

At this point, the storm had started to let up, and the thunder was far less frequent and moving away.  My father and I walked around to the back of the house with the firemen, meeting my mother out back, while she held an umbrella over herself and my brother, who was in her arms and finally starting to quiet down.

A half dozen firemen trampled through the yard in full firefighting gear inspecting the strangely colored grass, while my father and I looked on.

After about ten minutes of inspecting everything, the crew leader for the firemen came to talk to my father.

""I don't know what to tell you.  I've been a fireman for twenty years, and have never seen anything like this.  It seems safe.""  He handed my father his card and got my father's information.  He instructed my father to call him if he noticed anything else odd with the grass, and said he'd call my father if he found out anything.

The grass eventually, over the course of a few weeks, returned to a natural color.  I never did find out what caused it.  That was thirty years ago.

***

**Edit:** I emailed my parents about it.  It turns out that it was much more mundane according to my father's account:

He said: 

&gt;""There wasn't that much to the story. Turns out it wasn't lightening, per se. It was a power line that ran down the alley behind the house that contacted a wet maple tree during a drizzle that followed the storm. The blue was momentary electrical shorting to ground. The firemen saw the bare wire and called BGE to fix it.

&gt;When we saw the blue, it was on the grass, but ended abruptly at the concrete sidewalk.

&gt;[Addressing my mom], is that how you remember it?""

***

My Mom's account:

&gt;I remember much the same but I thought the power line ran from the alley to our house in the backyard and went through a tree in our backyard.  Over time the branches had worn off the insulation covering the wire.  The electricity went from the wet leaves on the tree, down the trunk and into the grass.  The whole lawn was blue!  It's a good thing the dog was inside when it happened!!!  The firemen showed up in full gear but could do nothing but warn us to stay inside.  The electric company came the next day to trim the tree and replace the wire.  I agree that you were about 5 and [my brother] was 2 at the time.

***

My father's second reply:

&gt;[Addressing my mother], your memory is better than mine! You filled in more details and jogged my memory. You're right. I recall, too, that it was the power feed from the alley pole to our house.

&gt;I kinda recall BGE coming that night, but maybe not.

27,The Midnight,1301522298,"They say twelve o'clock at night is the witching hour--the nadir of darkness, when the height of evil and the supernatural's power and potential is at its greatest. It's always the traditional time that ghosts come out, the spell is cast, the curse is laid, and the night really begins.

Of course, this is what culture might tell you. None of it's true, at least not as far as the rest of the world knows. Physical darkness is greatest before dawn, and most supernatural occurrences seem to happen later, between two and four o'clock, rather than at midnight. At midnight, cities are still alive, many people are still awake, and late night programming has just started on television. Hell, bars don't even close until two or three o'clock in most places.

And yet, the cultural mystique remains. If one had to be in a cemetery late at night, one would probably choose ten or eleven, as opposed to right at midnight. Many stories choose midnight as the focal point of spiritual activity, as the final hour, or as the time of destiny. Why midnight? As I said, it is not the physically darkest time of night, nor does anything particularly special occur then in most cases except for the change of date. Maybe some midnights are special--New Year's Eve, Halloween, or even Christmas. But night after night the midnight hour passes, like clockwork, as it were. Modern Internet society might put some onus on the midnight hour--the Midnight Man, Bloody Mary, and a few other spectral ghouls that haunt the edges of our collective imagination. Even then, it's spectacularly few.

However, this cultural foreboding society has placed upon the midnight hour intrigued me, much to the point of obsession eventually. What started my fascination I can't quite remember anymore, but I do know I've enjoyed the supernatural, horror, and other things that go bump in the night since childhood. Somehow I had associated all of that with the nexus of the midnight hour. Oh, little did I know how dark it really is, how deep that rabbit hole went. If only...

I knew somehow that there had to be something out there, something far more terrible than any mythos our collective minds had come up with for the night--or even hell itself. There had to be something worse, something worth our fear. Poltergeists? No. Apparitions? No. The electric chill on your heart when you realize something is in the room with you? The shadow in the corner of your eye? No, none of that is worth terror, or even fear. Moving furniture, closing doors, footsteps, creaks, balls of light? Not hardly.

I concluded run of the mill ghostly happenings were not the root, but they were the symptom. What about our childhood horrors, or the named ghouls? Slender Man, Bloody Mary, the Boogeyman, girls in white dresses with long black hair that moved like spiders? No, not one.

The Midnight man? I studied this one for a while, given its name. I played his game several times, without salt, sometimes without a candle. He's real enough, and he answers the call of the ritual. He does appear as a black silhouette of a man, and can be seen in utter darkness as something even darker. He follows you around the house, he will even come upon you with a great cold, and one time he even passed through me. Yes, there was a sense of dread, but he could not penetrate my mind. I did not fear him. Did that cost him his power?

I searched so long. I've been to graveyards, haunted houses, abandoned churches, desolate buildings, dark forests, every place one might think to find something paranormal. Yes, I've had encounters--things I could not explain, but none that required running or averting my eyes. I have seen things in mirrors that aren't really there. I have seen milk-white apparitions skim the ground like some unearthly angel--girls without eyes, shadows of things that don't exist, black figures along the edge of the road. I have passed through graveyards where the infant dead are buried--it was very active, but nothing worth fearing. Why do we fear these ghosts, even those who might do us harm, if they could? They are no match for the living. Even demons, a few of which I've come upon, try to inspire fear, but they have no power here.

I felt like I was searching for nothing, like ghosts and things were merely something toying with us--like there was something greater controlling it all. Some might say it is Satan, or our imagination and that there is nothing at all. I know better. I have been down that road.

One stormy night in late summer, I was driving down a desolate rural two-lane road encircled by alternating cornfields and thick forest--the kind of road where there is no shoulder--just a strip of asphalt, a few inches of grass, then immediately the dense treeline. I had been told a shadow of a dog sometimes appeared in front of unwary drivers on this road, and many crashes had been caused by trying to avoid it. There wasn't much rain--it was one of those storms where the clouds are low and purple near the ground, boiling like a pot, and high winds and lightning with no thunder.

I was driving a bit slower than the speed limit, scanning the dense trees for anything unusual, but I was still doing 45 or so. Suddenly, something caught my attention--it was something unlike any ghost I'd seen before, but I only saw it for a moment. It reminded me of the descriptions of Mothman from out in West Virginia--huge and gray, with big black wings. It seemed to have a humanoid shape--as soon as I saw it, it was gone--but not entirely. I saw it charging through the trees in some sort of strange blur, and then the trees ended in a huge cornfield on rolling hills. I stopped my car. If only I had kept driving.

I left the car running, but put it in park. I opened the door and stepped out into that wild night. The wind whipped at my clothes and the cornstalks--but something back there was moving against the wind through the field. Every atom in my body told me to leave it be. Sickness washed over me, I wretched dryly onto the pavement. The dread got worse and worse, but my cocky ego wouldn't let me leave. No, I had to see it. I stepped into the cornfield and began tracking whatever it was through the stalks. It was moving slowly now, and I was catching up to it.

Something rose above the corn just a few yards ahead of me. Two shadows of a strange shape--with horror I realized what they were. Those were wings. Wings being stretched out from some huge nightmare just feet from me. It had to know I was there. And yet I kept going. It had stopped now. I was fumbling through the corn towards it. The stalks were getting darker, as if concealed in shade. A fog writhed along the ground, but not a natural fog--it was a seething cloud of black, boiling more than the storm cloud above. As it washed over my lower body a freeze went through me from sole to spine. I stopped--and was behind it. I could see black wings and a huge gray body, transitioning between solid and translucent, standing within the darkness, spawning more darkness as it stood. I couldn't move any further. The creature turned around.

The face was the most horrifying thing I had ever seen. It had glowing green eyes--phosphorescent green that actually illuminated the rest of its face. It had no lips like a skull, and a mouth full of needle-like canines. Its face was a mix of decay, flesh and shadow--like a skull. Its body was massive, probably over nine feet tall, and it had too many fingers, too many claws. Its lower body was less distinct, and was engulfed in the black fog that was running across the ground and my body.

I couldn't scream. No words or emotions could translate the feeling of absolute immortal terror that had gripped me. I swore I could feel my soul itself turning black and withering away. It caught my eyes with its own and held them there. I managed to glance down at my watch.

12:00:00 AM. It was midnight.

I managed to gasp. That was impossible. It had been barely ten o'clock when I had left the car. As though the horrible beast were influencing my racing thoughts, a sickening realization came over me. I knew what I was looking at, and I knew what I had found.

It was him--the darkest of all nightmares, the terror I had been looking for. He was the incarnation of the midnight hour. The midnight itself.

Suddenly I found my footing. My body snapped back to life out of the freeze it had encountered. I turned and ran through the fields back towards the road as fast as I could, gasping for air, stumbling over the uneven ground, grasping the pain in my side. It didn't follow me, at least I thought it didn't. I didn't look back to find out.

Suddenly I burst out of the fields onto the narrow road. My car was sitting there--still running, amazingly. I jumped in as fast as I could and spun my way out of there as fast as I could go, probably doing ninety or faster.

Once I was further away and the horror was beginning to subside, I began going over what I had seen, or whether I had dreamed or hallucinated it all. I fumbled for the radio to get the deafening silence out. I couldn't find a station--I looked down and almost went off the road with horror. The car clock read 12:00 AM. It hadn't moved off that time for a while now. I brought my shaking arm within view to see the watch.

Midnight.

I looked back up just as the car wrapped itself around a tree.

I awoke some unknown time later, but could not see anything. Everything was completely black. The car was hissing with leaking coolant, and somehow I had survived.

I heard a chime--like an old grandfather clock striking. Then it came again. And again. I counted them silently, shaking violently. Twelve of them. Wherever I was, it was still midnight.

I finally began to see something. The sun was rising. I looked quickly around--I was in my bed! Had I dreamed the whole thing? I ran to the window--my car was unharmed outside! I passed the mirror to leave the room--and in the background, I saw the alarm clock's reflection read 12:00 AM, and something black sneered at me.

It wasn't the last time I would see him, and the encounters would get progressively more bizarre. Eventually, I will post more of what he and I have seen.

28,Am I crazy?,1301511427,"I don't believe in the paranormal. Ultimately, it's comparable to my belief (or lack of belief) in God: until I experience some kind of proof myself, even the most irrational, I'm going to stick with the obvious: science. Since the beginning of our species, mankind has explained what we can't understand with the supernatural, when really these things are probably just natural phenomena, misfiring neurons, tricks of the light, etc. Probably.

So, Reddit, here is my question. My boyfriend and I have recently had a baby, and the three of us (four, actually, if you count our lovably dimwitted Beagle) are all set to move next month into a rental property my dad owns. It's perfect for a new family: modest, fairly small but with a huge backyard. It's near the local dog park and my favorite natural foods store. And because of an irrelevent paperwork situation, my dad won't need to charge us any rent!

However. About 7 or 8 years ago, I'm at Disneyland with my then-boyfriend when I get a call from my dad.  The woman who is renting the house we're now about to move into... her brother had come over the night before, and ended up shooting himself in the rec room. Fatally, since it's pretty unusual to live through a point-blank range  shotgun blow to the face.

There was no question about it being a suicide. As far as we know, he had come to his sister and her son because he was depressed and simply decided there was no other way out. The house has been occupied by a couple of different families since then, each for a decent amount of time. But thinking about living in a house where this happened is giving me the heebiejeebies. Every time I go into that room I'm sure I'll picture the blood that's been on those walls, the guy slumped over his sister's guest bed, unrecognizable. For his part, my boyfriend couldn't be less concerned about what happened there. Am I crazy to be weirded out by this?",nosleep,wayword,/r/nosleep/comments/geweq/am_i_crazy/
29,Horrible Dancing Monster,1301510502,"A few years ago I was at a New Year's Eve party with some friends. We were drinking and smoking and playing some music and generally having a good time when I decided to go outside to smoke a cigarette. It was dark and I was a bit drunk, but hadn't taken any drugs, so there was no reason for me to be hallucinating.

The apartment building where my friend lived was three stories, and behind this building there was a little stand of birch trees. 
I was standing in the Birch trees smoking when I happened to look up at the apartment building. One of the third story windows was lit, and the blinds were down, but open, and I could see something moving back and forth, like a person in a rocking chair. I thought this was odd, and as I watched, I was overcome with a horrible feeling, like whatever it was up there.. had noticed me noticing it.

The 'person' began to move it's arms in a strange way, back and forth. They appeared to stand up, as they got taller, and they were standing at the window doing this really strange dance. I recognize that it sounds crazy, but the way this thing was moving wasn't human. I have never seen any person move the way that that thing did. It was horrifying and all I could do was stand there and watch it. 

It began to back up in to the room, still dancing as it did so, and moved far enough back in to the room that I could no longer see it through the window, but I swear I could **feel** it there.

I was so freaked out that I ran back to my friend's apartment, abandoning my cigarette. I didn't mention anything to my friends because I didn't want to talk about it for fear of it. However, the next day I told my cousin about the incident. 

A week or so later, my cousin and I were paying a visit to my friend who had had the party. We went outside to smoke and my cousin pointed up to the window where I had seen the dancing thing and asked if that was the window I had seen it in, without having any way of knowing which window it was.

30,Something In My Backyard,1301505767,"When I was a child, my family lived on two acres in a one story house with a basement. The front yard was about a half acre and the back yard was about an acre and a half. Behind our property was a cornfield. At the very back of the yard the grass was high because we skipped that part when mowing. The way the yard sloped, the basement had a door that opened into the yard but that was the only part of the basement exposed. Our kitchen was at the back part of the house. There was one window that opened and another large window about eight feet by six feet that overlooked the backyard. We had two dogs that stayed outside in dog houses in the back. Okay, done setting the scene.

One summer night when I was about six, something happened. It must have been fairly late because it was fully dark out. It was very warm too so we had the windows open. I don't remember what I was doing before things started getting strange, probably watching T.V. or playing with toys, but there was suddenly a lot of barking coming from my backyard. Now, it wasn't uncommon for my dogs to be barking at night. We lived in the country and there were often deer in the field or in our garden. This was different though. Their barking seemed more frightened. It had that occasional whine of a nervous dog. I went to my sister to ask what was up with our dogs and she said she didn't know. Our parents were in the kitchen so we went to ask them. They were arguing about something so we sat and listened. I don't fully remember the conversation but from what I've been told by my family, this is the gist. 

There was a light out in the field and we had no idea what it was. The barking of our dogs had drawn my parents' attention to it. While they were sitting there watching it they could here a strange noise coming through the window. The way my mother describes it to me it was like the bleating of a dying sheep. Now, my mother has always been interested in the supernatural/paranormal/extraterrestrial. She's had several experiences (which I want to post later) and is nearly fearless. Anyways, my parents could hear this and there was definitely something in our backyard. They knew and the dogs surely knew it. Whatever it was it was making the dogs nervous as hell. My mom wanted to find out what it was and was preparing to go back there but my father would have none of that. He was frightened. I've never seen my dad scared before or since but whatever was back there had him spooked. They started arguing but eventually my mother relented after my sister and I begged her not to go. My dad went around and locked all of our doors and windows. We all sat in the living room to watch TV and calm down but we could still hear the dogs barking and I was scared. Eventually they stopped and we fell asleep. The next day we found the dogs curled up in their houses. We walked around the yard and found random burn marks in the grass and the high grass at the back of our yard had been pushed down as if someone or something had walked through it. 

To this day my dad doesn't like to talk about it. My mom still wishes she could have seen what it was and my sister just remembers how scared we all were. I'm not a very good story teller so I apologize if this wasn't very good. It all really happened though. ",nosleep,Javier_Disco,/r/nosleep/comments/getnl/something_in_my_backyard/
31,Why would they listen to me? #2,1301505347,"This next story I'm submitting is with regards to the first paranormal experience I encountered. The entire event was harrowing, to say the least, but in some ways, I hope this may get some of what happened out of my mind. Too long have I dwelt on what happened that night, and it feels great to be able to get this off my chest.


I received a phone call after returning home from school one day, and although the line was connected, the most I could hear was an eek, at that. After pestering the caller, I found it to be Jeff's Mother, and that her son, my best friend, had just been killed in a hunting accident.


 I grew up in in small mountain town in Alaska, where your capacity for fun was limited only by your bravado, and imagination. Being as remote as it was, hiking, hunting, and fishing were the only recreational activites available. With my youthful curiosity and awe by my side, I jumped head first into all of these categories, with my best friend Jeff at my side.

 Jeff and I did everything together; growing up, we would either be on the lake catching salmon, or in the mountains hunting rabbits. For fourth graders, we were our own kings.
 Aside from the countless backtrails, and bear paths we so eagerly trekked, one in particular stood out above the rest. On a mountain, whose name has long since been forgotten to time, was a narrow pathway near the summit. After an arduous two+ hour hike, you were greeted with these 500 foot cliffs, with two waterfalls cascading down the side. Whether it by divine grace, or mystery of nature, I'll never know, but the position of these waterfalls was such that when they descended towards each other, they created what appeared to be angel's wings, or as our young minds' declared, ""The wings of the Valkyrie"". 
 Being at such an impressionable young age, when our teacher gave us a book on Nordic mythology, we abosolutely delved into it, eventually naming that part of the trail, ""The cliffs of Asgaard"".

 What made this so special was the same waterfalls creating the wings, also made this wonderfully dangerous miasma. This cloud of mist that surely enveloped anyone who passed under there, creating this atmosphere of both wonderment, and this effluent sense of spirituality, where only the echoing sounds of thresing water reverberated through your blind thoughts.

 Fast foward to four years later, and I was given the opportunity to return from the west coast to Alaska, to return to my home town, and with it, return to those thoughts I'd so long ago suppressed into the back of my mind. I accepted.

 I arrived into town midday, and during the drive back, I could spot each trail from every mountain, calling my name, beckoning me back to those shrouded paths, the uncertain adventure, the memories.

 After a quick lunch, I visited Jeff's grave, a small plot in the corner of the cemetary, and noticed a bouquet of wilted flowers, decaying into the earth. I paralleled the flowers to that of Jeff and myself's relationship before he died; fresh, vibrant at the start, and as time should so surely have passed, the strain of distance slowly killing all the wonderment held between two kindred spirits. I cried. Even now, as I think back and form my memories to word, it still pains me to think of that moment, the self-loathing, the disgust for missing my best friends' funeral.
 I relented, and was determined that I should make it up to Jeff, in a way that he would have done for me, to get a rock from the cliffs of Asgaard, and place it on his grave. Sentiments aside, he would have appreciated that I never forgot about our spot. us.

 Around 6PM, I had packed everything I needed, and found myself staring at the all too familiar trailhead, a rush of memories, and child's laughter echoing throughout the forest. It was already getting dark, but this was something I needed to do. If not for me, for him.

 The path was overgrown, years of neglect taking its hold as roots slowly etched their way across the mossy ground, making the trip twice as long as I had expected, tripping, and sliding up each bend the mountain offered.

 By the time I arrived at the opening, the moon was out; for a moment, I lost myself in awe. The reflection of the wings against the pale rock face was truly spectacular, with each star in the night sky reflecting my effervescent thoughts. I made my way into the miasma; a flurry of grey mist caressing my being, as if to hold me fast to the aging trail.

 I arrived towards the end of the cliff face, where part of the rocks had begun to break apart, I grabbed a palm-sized slab and placed it into my backpack. While I was kneeling down, my headlamp caught something I had not previously noticed. At about waist height, there appeared to be something chiseled into the cliff face. I looked closer, and saw what read, ""JEFF AN JUSTINS SPOT"". A dervish of emotion overtook me, I gathered Jeff must have chipped that in there when I left, and I couldn't take it.

 With a lump in my throat, I donned my backpack again, and headed towards the mist.

About halfway through, I heard a voice. At first, it sounded like a childs', and I listened for it again, the sound of the waterfalls my only companion.
 I heard it again, it was a childs' voice saying my name, a little louder than before. I strained my eyes ahead and saw a figure appear in the mist, it was Jeff.

 He looked just as he did the day I left, and again, he says my name, ""Justin"". I swallowed hard, not sure whether to denounce this as my mind's grasp on reality was going slack, or accept that my friend long passed was reaching out to me.

""J..Jeff?"", I whispered out, ""Jeff, is that you buddy?"" he smiled, and came closer still.

""Justin, you're all grown up now, I'm glad I could see you one last time"" he said, all the while smiling, ""You were always there for me, I wish it hadn't ended like this"".

""Yeah, buddy, I know what you mean, I missed you everyday"" I said, holding back the tears.

""It's time to go now, Justin"". As he said this, he approached closer, arms outstretched.

I motioned closer, to hug him as well, corporeal and incorporeal joining together, when he all but disappated.
 I blinked for a few seconds, and knew he was gone. Still in a catatonic state from what had just happened, I hear, ""Justin, RUN"", ""JUSTIN, RUN"", ""JUSTIN, RUN"", with the final command bouncing off the walls off the cliff, and into the night sky.

Confused, I started to jog down the moutain trail, I made it a good quarter mile when I heard it. Behind me, I could hear thrashing of trees, and the smashing of roots. Something was chasing me.

I picked up speed, sprinting down the masses of moss covered rocks, skipping over the jagged roots so earnest to impede me.

Then, I slipped. As a ran through a stream, the thunder of overturned bushes behind me ringing in my ears, I stepped on a mossy rock at the wrong angle, and fell into the brush, seven feet or so below. When I fell, my headlamp deserted me, landing on the trail facing up towards my impending doom.

 I tried moving out, and was encompassed in pain, I stifled my yell as best I could, feeling the numbness of my leg coursing through my body. As much as I desired to leave, I was helpless to wait for the end.

 I held my breath, my eyes betraying every nerve in my body, the realization coming over me that I too, would join Jeff at the cliffs of Asgaard. It is then, I finally see what was chasing me, what Jeff had so tried to warn me about.

 The biggest brown bear I have ever seen thundered down the trail, and slowed it's pace to a crawl, a killing crawl, when the headlamp came into view. From the look in its' hungry eyes, I could see the thrill of the hunt transponding to every nerve in his body; he wanted fresh meat, and he was just in reach of getting it.

 I had attempted to grab my pistol out of the backpack, but at that point, I was too afraid to move, and under the circumstances, the move would have been in vain; I was completely tangled in the brush.

 The bear sniffed the hat, batting at it with its' paws before sticking its' head, that massive, massive head, in the air, tracing my scent. It looked around, like a blind man feeling for his cane, before it looked DIRECTLY AT ME, and stopped.

 We were locked in this gaze, man and beast, as if time itself were transfixed to make the moment last an eternity.

The bear hesitated for a moment more, then continued running down the mountain. I sighed a breath of relief, and remained motionless for another 30 or so odd seconds, making sure the crescendo of broken branches was out of earshot.

Another twenty or so minutes of positioning my body, I crawled back onto the trail, pistol in hand, and donned the headlamp again.

I managed to make (absolutely terrible one BTW) a splint for my leg, and picked up a large stick to support my weight on.

After an arduous 2 or so more hours, I managed to make it out of the trail, the path considerably easier with the advent of the bear destroying most of the obstructions.

When I got closer into town, I managed to get cell phone service, and called an ambulance to meet me as I was driving in, I ended up fracturing my tib/fib and was in and out of the hospital for a good week.

Once I had been deemed, ""OK"" by the doctor, I grabbed the backpack, which had taken one hell of a beating apparently, and drove over to the cemetary. Inching along slowly, I arrived at the last grave plot, in the corner.
 I noticed new flowers on Jeff's grave, and placed the slab of rock from the cliffs against his tombstone. I said a prayer, and walked back to my truck.

TL;DR - My friend had my back even after he passed away.

32,Restrooms Closed for Maintenance,1301504235,"The office building I work in is very well-maintained. You send in a request for service and they get back to you within minutes. As well they ought to, I suppose, for the scandalous amount that they require for yearly rent. I'm the receptionist, so I route most service requests for our office. About a month ago, the motion sensor on one of the toilets in the ladies room on our floor malfunctioned. Random flushes coming from an empty bathroom gets annoying quickly, so I put in a request.

Apparently, it was a slightly more intensive job than the maintenance crew had thought as we were redirected to the tenth floor for restroom usage. I remember wondering what, exactly was up there. I've never seen anyone, the whole year that I've worked here, hop in the elevator and push the button for the tenth floor. When time came for my break, I had actually forgotten that the ladies room on our floor was out of commission and laughed self-deprecatingly as I saw the sign. Some genius, right? I mean, I put in that service request myself. So up I go, two more floors, to get to ten.

It's really kind of dim up there. Our floor has tons of fluorescent lights, really cream walls. Very bright, very open. I guess on ten they decided to go with recessed lighting and this weird, matte burgundy wallpaper. The paneling is straight out of the seventies though, that dark kind of cherry wood. Weird, but you know, decadent. I suppose I may have had a passing thought about law firms being up there too. I think I may have muttered something about pompous aesthetics. Seems like something I would say.

Plush carpet though, the really well cushioned stuff that makes footsteps sound very soft. I had some fun with that, walking down the hall to the bathroom. Some of the offices were open, all sleek wood and chrome. Now, I definitely remember muttering some crack about arrogance and money here. Geeze, that hallway went for miles... Alright, not miles, but it was long. Finally, the much anticipated door with a blue sign that had a little woman figure on it. Lovely. I remember thinking it was perfect timing, my back teeth were practically floating.

The bathroom, man, what a contrast. Everything else I saw on that floor was so sleek and polished. These floor ten chicks actually pee in here? The tile was black and white checked, one single fluorescent strip lighting the whole bathroom in it's weak, and *oh great* flickering glow. It kind of smelled in there too. Hey, I'm not one to complain, don't get me wrong, but... Urine mixed with... I dunno, something tinny, metallic in a way... It set my teeth on edge, like nails on a chalkboard.

Now, all the way up there, I'd been so busy thinking about how bad I had to pee, and how ridiculous and presumptuous the decor was, that I hadn't really paid attention to how silent it was. None of the usual office hum that I could hear from our ladies room downstairs. Weird, but kind of cool. I remember wishing we had our walls soundproofed too, so I didn't have to listen to the copier whining when I wanted a minute to myself.

*You know what,* I thought, *scratch that. It's too isolated in here.* Then the door opened. Someone walked in, so I peeked out, you know what I'm talking about, that little crack between the door and the frame? Don't even pretend you don't do it too. Silent judgment of the other person, trying to guess who it is by their back and shoes. It was weird though... I guess I must have imagined the door opening. Nobody was there. I chuckled to myself, and you know, finished up.

Washing my hands, I started to realize it was really cold in there. Geeze, a little much with the ac, I thought. It was like being inside a poorly tiled, badly lit glacier. Weird, how the smell shifted too, smelled less like that bizarre urine and metal mixture and more like this really overly sweet perfume. You know, the kind that makes you gag a little? Whoever she was, she must have used quite a bit for it to linger like that... I half giggled at the thought of everyone in her office gagging on that sickly sweet stench. We had an excessive perfumer wearer too. 

So, business attended to, I'm checking my hair, making sure all the makeup is good, no smeared eyeliner or anything, and I hear this... Tapping. Like a high heel being impatiently tapped. I mean, that's not a sound you can forget, it's pretty distinctive. I do it myself when the copier runs slow or the fax is taking it's time. So I, totally on reflex, look up into the mirror. 

She was there for half a heartbeat then gone. Pretty sure the color drained from my face. I get this feeling, the one in the pit of your stomach that says *don't let her know that you saw her.* So I go with this feeling and finish up with my spot check of attire, check my hose for runs, and finish drying my hands. The whole time, that crazy tapping is getting louder and faster, and my heart is just hammering along like a racehorse rounding the final turn. 

So I casually, very casually, toss the paper towel and head for the door. I just know that it would be a very bad, outright terrible idea to check the mirror. I'm begging my traitorous eyes not to look. So, of course, being my eyes, they look. And oh god, she haunts my nightmares. I try, very casually, to go for the door, eyes locked on her figure where she's primping her brittle hair in the mirror, checking her decaying skin for any makeup flaw... And as my hand hits the knob and begins to twist, she, reflexively, looks up. You just look up when someone enters or exits a bathroom. Curiosity? Human nature? I dunno, but you do. Some habits never die I guess. She locks eyes with me and it's like a signal to bolt, get the fuck out of dodge.

I tear off down the hallway, that mile long stretch of well padded carpet. I can hear my breath clawing it's way in and out in harsh pants, I can hear my heels thudding softly into the carpet, pace frantic... Suddenly, there's a second set of footsteps, thudding behind me. And they're gaining. 

I slam into the elevator button, back to the wall, jabbing it over and over again. My eyes, were wide open, searching, waiting for her. I tried to calm the harsh pants to see if I could hear her. I heard the footsteps getting closer, then mercifully, the ding of the elevator. I scrambled in, stabbing at the ""close doors"" button, gasps near sobbing from me as the footsteps got closer. The last thing I saw as the doors shut was her pretty, decaying face, twisted into a snarl.

The elevator music was soothing. I tried to calm down. The doors slid open on my floor, all cream walls and fluorescent lights. I think I may have teared up a little. I sat down at my desk. I think I answered the phones for the rest of the day, or maybe they just rang. I don't remember. I remember  inhaling slowly, searching for the scent of her perfume and decay. 

I don't go up to floor ten anymore. I'll go down to the fourth, four floors of elevator music and needing to pee instead of two. The fourth floor is bright and cheerful. I like it better. But it's funny, it seems there's always a lingering smell in the bathroom. Urine and something... Metallic.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/get1q/restrooms_closed_for_maintenance/

34,Something Moved,1301501080,"I remember being startled awake by a terrible crashing noise around 3am one night.  

""Sigh"", I thought to myself, ""The cat knocked something over.  Again.""

I walked into the living room, towards the origin of what I'd heard. Everything was quiet.  The moon cast a faint glow onto the furniture.  The room seemed undisturbed.  In the dim light, I spotted my cat.  He was curled up, asleep on the couch.

""Typical"", I muttered to the kitty, ""You cause havok, and then pretend like nothing at all happened.""

There was no reaction from the cat.  He was fast asleep.  His adventure that lead to my awakening already long forgotten, and a new one likely forming as he napped.

""Eh... While I'm up, might as well go to the bathroom.""

I wandered in and flicked the light switch.  Nothing.

""Great.  Now I'll have to look for what the cat knocked over, AND change a lightbulb in the morning.""

Thankfully, there was enough moonlight for me to do my business.  I washed my hands, and looked up into the mirror.  It was pretty fogged up from the humidity in the bathroom, so I was only able to make out vauge shapes, and colours.  I saw something move, and focused on it.  Outside of the bathroom, my cat's reflection was staring back at me.

""Oh, so now you pay attention to me.  You think I've forgotten about--""

Another crashing noise, this time much louder.  I turned around,--the cat was long gone again, of course--and walked towards the living room.

""That's it.  Time out for you, buddy!""

I scooped my cat up off the floor, walked back to the bathroom, placed him in there, and shut the door.

""Time for some peace and quiet."", I thought as I wandered back to the bedroom, ""I'll deal with whatever he knocked over in the morning.""

Of course, I was wrong about the peace and quiet.  My cat quickly signaled his displeasure about being confined by meowing loudly, and scratching at the door.  This behaviour proved to be mercifully short, however, as everything became silent in the early hours of the sunrise.

I thought to myself, ""Finally.  He's accepted his punishment.  I'll let him out when I wake up in a few hours."", and drifted off to sleep.

It was difficult to wake up.  Even though it had been a few hours since my night time adventure, it felt as it if had happened mere minutes ago.  I walked out of my bedroom and passed the still-closed bathroom door.  Everything was quiet.

""Good, he must be asleep."", I thought.  ""I'll let him out after I have some breakfast.""

Wandering past the living room, I glanced over to survey the damage.

I saw my cat, curled up, asleep on the couch.

In a sudden rush of adrenaline, and panic, I raced to the bathroom door.  As I got there, I could hear faint scratching coming from inside.  Against my better judgement, I flung the door open.

There was nothing there.

I glanced in the mirror.

1. No more opening with ""I'm a bad writer etc.""; I doubt many here expect everyone to be Franz Kafka- just tell your story as only you know how

2. No more use of ""fast forward"" to indicate the passage of time; this tantamount to opening an autobiographical college essay and beginning by describing waking up. I know all of you guys can come up with a better chronological segue

3. No more describing the environment said story takes place in by saying ""OK, here's the setup""

NOSLEEP TIL... FOREVER",nosleep,metatronatra,/r/nosleep/comments/geqc9/nosleep_wishlist/
36,My Healing Dream,1301494296,"This has religious undertones. 
Happened to me after I had been sexually assaulted at college and was at home trying to cope with the after effects of the event. For me it was a particularly dark time in my life. 

About a week after it happened most of my family had left and I actually was in my house alone. I had had a few experiences in this house before. Soft touches ; breathing ; feelings of not being alone, etc. Nothing too outrageous or even scary really. I was laying in my room after taking a shower and just trying to let my mind go blank..I didn't want to think about anything, just... void.

I don’t remember really how it started I just remembered all of a sudden being there. When I was there I first noticed just how black everything was, it was blacker then just plain black, and it was complete darkness. 

Then the whispering started, they weren’t necessary all my sins but they were sins that everyone commits on a daily basis. Fingers from the whispers started to grope me all over, not in a sexual way, but it a way that confining me. I then started calling out for people I knew and loved; family, and some friends. The whispering continued still and their fingers continued to move and confide. Nothing I was doing up to that point was helping. I saw light then, a flash and then it was gone. Then a sudden stream shot through what would be a ceiling of some sort. 

I tried to move forward but their fingers seemed to multiply and hold one to me still. It was then that I started to pray and quote scripture. I kept struggling and praying and striving towards the light. It seemed that I would finally get there and the light would shift and move somewhere else. 

I could only move when I was quoting and praying. I never got frustrated at the light, I only got frustrated with the whispers, their whispering had gotten louder and their fingers multiplying again. It seemed like the more I prayed and quoted the louder and more confining they tried to become.  

I began to feel like it was because of them on me that the light kept moving. The scriptures I was quoting were in full verse as well. Usually the verses I remember are in words or pieces, not full complete verse. The one that I remember the most was when Jesus was tempted by Satan in the desert. I remember quoting that one because it seemed like while I was saying “water”, “bread”, “mountain” ;scenes would flash for me. Images of the temptation.

I knew I was gaining on the whispering fingers after a while, but it seemed like I was getting nowhere and the helplessness was almost setting in. I felt weighed down, I was so tired, tired of struggling against the hands and fingers.Tired of trying to remember scripture and the whispers of sins and deeds.  I felt myself kneeling, weary, the hands turned from confining to almost patting, acceptance of my forgotten struggle towards the light. 

It was then that I prayed “Please Jesus; just let this torture stop”. I was then instantly awake and in my room. I felt like I shouldn’t have been there, it took my about 30 seconds to recognize my room and realize where I was. My whole body was twitching and tingly. I felt like I couldn't breathe and was gasping. I heard a small whisper near the back of the room behind my bed almost :""breathe, breathe"". The voice was nonsexual, just steady and present. 

The darkness of the room started to scare me and remind me of where I was so I turned on the lamp besides my bed, willing my body to calm down. The odd thing was my heart wasn’t racing or anything, just my body and mind. I felt confused and unsure of what just had happened to me. It took me awhile to realize myself as well, it seemed like I was re entering my body for some reason and had to remilitarize myself with it. I still felt the ""presence"" that had told me to breathe with me, it didn't scare me, just almost made me feel in a way I was actually 'home' again. I then laid back down and fell asleep with the light still on, not wanting the whispering fingers to come back.

I haven't had a experience with the fingers since then, but my experience is still very real and vivid in my head like it happened yesterday still.

37,Which would you rather encounter - ghost or alien?,1301483860,"After reading [this mind fuck of a story](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ge5wo/why_i_refuse_to_work_late_anymore/)--and getting chills that still won't go away--as well as some good alien conspiracy posts, I began to wonder:  if I had to come in contact with one or the other, which would be less horrifying?

Personally, I think an alien would be easier to deal with since, along with shitting myself, I'd also be thinking the whole time, ""Ha!  Mother fucking proof!""  I don't think my own ego would be enough to hold off PTSD, and I'd probably ball up into a nervous wreck throughout the ordeal, but it'd be something I could wrap my mind around.

A ghost, on the other hand, is typically unseen (not that I'd know from personal experience, but I've read enough /nosleep and watched enough Ghost Hunters to be convinced as such).  It's also from a different dimensional place, not a different physical place, like a carbon-based alien life form.  They're also impossible to explain, which I think is part of what scares the shit out of people when they come in contact with one.  Also, aliens eventually pack their shit up and head home, whereas ghosts like to hang out and screw with your mind.

I told myself that MM/SM is a joke, and I would love to meet him. Those words I truly regret. For I think I am going to meet him soon.



On March 28th, 2011 Roughly 12:40 AM, I decided it would be a great time to go on a walk with my dog, the rain had finally stopped, and my dog was becoming restless. As I was locking the door, I noticed that something was off, my dog, who loves to run and play (a big goofy golden retriever), was frozen at the top of the porch. Most times she would be pulling the leash so hard, that I would have trouble reaching the key to the door to lock it. This time, nothing, she might as well have been a statue, paralyzed by complete fear. Then I notice that she is looking at something across the cul-de-sac. At first I thought it was a cat or something hiding under a car, or a deer eating my neighbors bushes, but after a few minutes of looking, I saw nothing. Walking down the stairs from the porch, I noticed my dog still had not moved, so I tugged on the leash, tried pushing her, etc. In the end I gave up, picked her up (Yes I had to pick up my 75 pound dog to get her inside), and carried her in to the house. As I was taking off my shoes and putting them in to the shoe closet, I noticed that she had now walked in to the living room, and was staring out of the window in the same direction she was when we were outside.



At this point, I was starting to get worried. There had to be something outside that is creeping my dog out this much. So after changing in to some more comfortable clothes, and grabbing something to drink and a book, I walked over to the living room, where my dog had not moved an inch or even made a single sound, and sat down on the couch. After 30 or so minutes of sitting watching the dog, I started to read my book, as soon as I started reading, I noticed my dog slowly moving her head, as if following something. I figured that whatever she saw was moving, and by the direction of her head, right from across the street, and on to my lawn. My house being built on top of a hill, The first floor is actually at least 10 feet off the ground. So for someone to be at window level, they would have to have a ladder, or be REALLY tall. I set the book down, and go up to the window, my dog is now looking directly below the window, as if something was standing under it. I see nothing but the grass and wall of the house, So at this point, I think that either my dog has gone crazy, or that this could be something paranormal (The thought of it being paranormal, did cross my mind as soon as my dog started acting strange outside, but I decided to push it back for now, no need to needlessly scare myself over what probably is nothing, right?). I decided that it would be best to retreat to the safety of my room, which also happened to be on the first floor, but along the side of the house, and even higher from the ground, seeing that there was a balcony that went from my room, to the living room. The balcony being solid wall, made it at least 20 feet from the ground, so anything climbing up on to my balcony would need a ladder or grappling hook.



After turning on all the lights between my room, and the living room, I decide to go get my dog, which still had not moved from her spot, It had been at least a good hour now, and I was seriously worried for her safety. I'm the type of guy that can watch a horror flick where a child will get brutally slaughtered, and not bat an eye, but if god help me, they kill off a dog, I will bawl my eyes out. So I go grab some doggie treats and start trying to bribe my dog to follow me, She ignores them. So I decided that I'm going to have to pick her up again, and carry her to my room. As I am bending over to pick her up, she starts to slowly move. She starts walking alongside the windows, as if someone was walking under them. This is when my stomach dropped, at this point I was very disturbed in how she was acting, I ended picking her up, and sprinting to my room, slamming my door shut, locking and barricading it with a lazy boy. For a few minutes, my dog was acting normal again, parading around the room with a toy in her mouth, nudging for me to play with her. So I start playing with her, tossing it across the room, and having her bring it back. After the forth throw, as she ran by the balcony doors, she stopped. And started staring through the glass again. I felt sick to my stomach, It had just hit me, before we left the living room, my dog had been following whatever was under the windows, along side the house. The only thing in that direction was my balcony. I look to her in horror, and for the first time, she looks back too, her eyes are filled with utter terror.



For the first few minutes I just sat there and stared at her, both of us paralyzed in fear. But I eventually managed to snap out of it, as soon as I did I picked her up, threw her on my bed, and took the couch near the balcony door, and pushed it in front of it, barricading the door. I grabbed duct tape and taped my curtains against the wall, so I would not be able to see what was on the other side, Or more so that it would not see me, but I knew it was pointless, It knew where I was regardless. After I was done with sealing the curtains, I walked over to the bed, where my dog lay, her eyes were filled with fear. I know when an animal is afraid of something you can not see, that it is probably something you don't want to see. I got in to the bed with her, pulled a blanket over us, and hugged her. Then suddenly, I got that feeling you get right before silence is broken, that feeling of dread, you know it is coming, but you are too late to react, to cover your ears. because as soon as the thought processes, it happens. 



Tapping, I hear tapping on my balcony door. It seems to be a series of 5 taps, as if someone was doing the wave with their fingers (sorry if that is not a good explanation). After what seemed to be decades , the taps seemed to start to travel, travel along the wall, in the direction of my bed, my bed being in the corner, of the room, and on the same wall as the balcony door. Every time they got closer, I felt my heart beat faster and faster, by the time the taps were right next to where my head was against the wall, I thought my heart was going to burst through my chest, I was probably going to die from fright, before this thing got to me. The taps stopped, I could hear my heart, still racing. Then the same feeling I felt before the tapping started, I knew that silence was going to be broken any second now. The lazy boy I had in front of my door, SLIDES across the room, smashing in to the couch I had barricading the balcony doors. My lights flicker off, and I hear my doorway crack open (The side of the door is cracked, it was as if the door was pushed so hard that the locking mechanism snapped right through the side) It takes a few minutes for my eyes to adjust, But then I see it, there is a tall dark figure in the doorway, dressed in black, head almost touching the celling. It stood there for a good 10 seconds, and then whispered, ""Tomorrow night then"" I could almost hear slight disappointment in it's voice. After standing there for another few seconds, it leaves. I stayed in bed for a few minutes to make sure it was gone, and then sprinted for the light switch with one hand, while slamming the door with the other. I did not sleep last night.




So now here is my question for /nosleep, is it possible to be playing The Midnight Game, without the ritual? Without my consent? I figured I must be playing, seeing that this whole ordeal started around Midnight, and ended around 3. And the fact that I was ridiculing the Midnight Man's existence for the past few days prior is probably no coincidence. Did I make him angry? Is there a way to stop/end this? As I am finishing up this post, I see that it is 11:10PM, I have 50 minutes until midnight falls again. I have several candles, and bottles of salt. I think if I play this game with him, and win, that he might leave me alone. Tho I am not even sure that the rules even exist at this point. I don't know what else to do... I'm afraid... I may just be repenting on the 11th hour (Literally)... But this is the thing I regret most in life, doubting the Midnight Man's existence...If I'm to escape this nightmare...never again will I joke around with something as serious as this... 


I'm so sorry... I really am.


**UPDATE:**
Sorry for the delay in reply, I have been sleeping all day... seeing that I was up all night... It seems the lack of sleep and stress is taking its tole on me. Even during the day he manages to haunt me, in my dreams, in my mind. I know he is somewhere close by, waiting, waiting for night to fall again and the clock to strike midnight once more... to start my nightmare all over again. I will post my nightmarish second night, later today... when I have time, time to sit and wait, wait for another nightmare to begin.


I can't escape, he is still after me, and I fear that he will get me soon... I'm bound to slip up eventually...

40,Written on a text document.,1301462040,"     Roger Evans was an inconspicuous fellow; quiet and demure.  He had the kind of personality that led to people asking his name at office parties year-after-year, as though he were new.  This name that was so easily forgotten in life would be immortalized with the strange circumstances of his death.
	Roger was at his desk before anyone arrived in the morning and was the last to leave, so the other employees just didn’t notice when he stopped leaving the office at all.  In fact, the only indication that anything out of the ordinary was occurring was that the ever-meticulous Roger failed to clock in.  It was four days into the work week before this was noticed by payroll and his supervisor was alerted to the situation.
	“Oh, there must be some mistake.  I’ve seen him here everyday this week!”
And seeing Roger at his desk down the central corridor between rows of cubicles, the supervisor was confident that this mix-up would soon be explained.  But with every step the young manager took toward Roger, his confidence was eroded by a swelling sense of dread.  Roger was still.  Too still.
	The supervisor finally reached him and standing over his neatly arranged desk, began talking.  “Roger!” he began, trying to convince his nerves to calm with the forced normalcy of his inflection.  “It seems there is some kind of problem with payroll.”  But, there was no reply.
	The other employees rushed over to the desk when they heard the manager’s scream.  Roger was dead.  His skin hung slightly too loose on his thin frame and had the faint sallow hue of rotten meat.  Soon people were gagging from an overpowering smell of decaying flesh that none seemed to notice until just then.

--

	The length of time the body had been decomposing in a position of perfect posture, with hands still poised over the computer’s keyboard, made the Evans case particularly striking.  Add to that the amount of people who worked around his corpse for days, perhaps even offering it an unreturned salutation, and the story is made all the more macabre.  However, the final detail of the case is what truly defies all attempts at reasonable explanation:
	As the scene around Roger’s body began to calm and his colleagues began organizing themselves to call the authorities, that same unlucky supervisor noticed something moving.  It took a moment for him to even register what happened… it wasn’t Roger’s body that moved.  No, it remained creepily statuesque.  It was his computer monitor.  The screensaver had turned on.  His pulse began to rise and it was a deafening beat in his ears before he realized why he was getting worked up…
Every employee’s computer was locked by the system administrator and shared the same basic settings.  The screensavers were programmed to engage after an annoyingly short 10 minutes of inactivity.  And Roger Evan’s screensaver had just now engaged.
The color drained from the supervisor’s face as he stepped, wide-eyed, toward the computer.  He moved the mouse and the screensaver disappeared, revealing one short sentence on a text document:  

“Roger Evans didn't write this.”",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/gei0l/written_on_a_text_document/
41,Afraid to shut my eyes...,1301457433,"As a recent subscriber to nosleep, at first I was skeptical of some of the stories. But reading some of the stories brought back some recent memories that I've tried to push to the back of my mind. There are no spirits, poltergeists or devils in the experience I've had so far - just the trap of my own mind.

Last year, I had a life-altering experience (actually, a few of them). I was robbed Jan. 1, 2010 and for the first 9 months of the year, things were at an all time low. My boyfriend dumped me after I had a freak out from a change in my medication to treat my bipolar disorder. I took two more drugs, one wound me up in the ER, unable to talk and barely able to move. A cocktail of morphine, benadryl and one other medication that I forget the name of brought me back to normal.

My doctor then tried me on a fourth medication. I felt nauseous from the beginning but tried to cope with it. After three trips to urgent care, I was finally admitted into the hospital with blood pressure around 80/60.

I had liver failure and was rushed into the ICU. I was very close to needing surgery, but luckily my body managed to heal with the help of medication because I am young (25). I managed to sleep - or something else - only one time for about 20 minutes (although it felt much longer) the entire 8 days I was in the hospital.

Those 20 minutes of ...sleep came when I had a fever of about 105 and the nurses had me on a cooling pad. I was freezing and felt I would never sleep, so it surprised me when it crept up on me. Sleep has always been elusive and I treasure it when I get it.

Falling asleep, at first I thought I was hallucinating or simply in a dream. First there were flashes of light, then images of dead leaves, dead trees, dead flowers. After that came the images of dead animals - birds, cats, dogs, raccoons, all kinds of animals. 

After this, I felt that I was rising out of my body. I saw myself sleeping there and I had to squint to make sure I was breathing. I was, but more slowly and shallowly than I thought possible. As I watched, I stopped moving at all. 

After that, I woke up (or came back to life?) when the nurse came bustling in. My monitors didn't work properly the whole time I was in the hospital because part of my condition was a terrible rash that had to be coated to protect my skin. The nurse scolded me - apparently my heart monitor had fallen off and she needed to put it back. I asked her how long I had been ...asleep and she said about 20 minutes. I felt that I had seen the death images for several hours.

After that episode, I couldn't sleep the whole time I was there. Nurses kept telling me to go to sleep, but I couldn't shut my eyes. However or whatever wanted to take me that night still wanted me. I could feel it.

Three days after I got out of the hospital, I managed to sleep for about 12 hours or so. They were gone...or so I thought.

Last night, I sensed them again. They followed me here even though I live about 100 miles from where I used to.

They followed me, despite the presence of my two cats, who I've read here are supposed to protect from evil spirits.

My cat is staring into the bedroom right now. I'm afraid to check in there and see what she is staring at.

42,Why I'm not a Doctor.,1301454166,"While everyone was out getting drunk and laid, I was at my parents’ suburban home studying for the MCATS. My parents spent their whole lives working high paying jobs, and as a result, were able to afford a three story mansion and fill it with lavish art deco and furniture. Recently, my Father decided to even buy a 15,000 dollar grand piano just because it looked cool.

I had moved out of state five years before and had to stay in the scarcely furnished guest room on the third floor at the end of the hallway.

It was 7pm and the sun was beginning to set. My parents were attending the annual rotary club auction and soon headed out. I resorted back to my books and continued studying.

I just finished reading the chapter about nucleus mitosis and glanced at the digital clock by the bed; it was 9 pm and it was pitch black outside and everywhere else in the house. I roll my chair over to the door and glance down the hallway; it was too dark to see anything. Realizing I had been studying for the past six hours, I decided to call it a night and collapsed on the bed. 

I was about to fuck the shit out of Megan Fox until I awoke to the sound of a door slam coming from downstairs. I looked at the clock and saw that it was only 10 pm. “my parents are probably home” I thought to myself. I fell asleep again.

I was awoken soon after to another sound; this time however, it was Mozart’s “Lacrimosa”, playing from the grand piano downstairs. “Is my dad seriously practicing right now?” I thought. I had to admit though, he was playing very well. 

I pulled the blanket over my head and tried to fall back asleep, but something was wrong: no one played piano in my family. My dad just bought the piano to piss my mom off. The piano continued to play.
I had a sudden urge to go check downstairs and see what’s going on, but realizing I was frozen with fear kept me from doing so. Instead, I reached for the home phone and called my Dad’s cellphone.  He answered: 
“Hello?” 

“Dad?”

“What’s up?”

“Where are you guys?”

“We’re on the ferry right now…“

The piano playing came to an abrupt stop.

I remained silent, my heart was skipping beats.

“Ryan?”

My voice was shaking:

“Yeah Dad?”

“Who’s on the other line?”

The piano stool screeched against the marble floor.

“Dad, there’s someone in the house…”

I heard something heavy sprint up the stairs and down the hallway. I jumped off the bed and slammed the door to my room and pushed my body up against it. My Dad’s voice was yelling over the phone demanding me to hang up and call the police.
I felt something slam against the door from the outside and I heard heavy breathing. 

After about ten seconds, everything went silent.
From the other side of the door, I heard a man’s voice calmly say something that sent chills down my neck:

“My wife was a doctor once, she never had time….she never had time for me.” 

The footsteps slowly walked away from my door and I heard the front door shut.

I was scared stiff and decided not to move from my spot against the door. It felt like hours before my parents and the police showed up. 

The police fully searched the house and discovered that the downstairs patio door had had its locks removed and were lying outside the door, severely rusted from years of exposure from the elements. 

The next day, I traded in my Medical books and changed my major to civil engineering.

43,The Stowaway.  ,1301453139,"9 am.  Feeling a special type of weariness reserved for teenagers and the dead, I rolled out of bed, put on my green, store polo and grabbed my travel mug of coffee.  It was a Tuesday, and at the pet store, that meant it was ""reptile and cricket day.""  Immediately, I put away the dozen or so new iguanas, ball pythons and Nile monitors that the Fed Ex guy dropped off.  After giving a customer a couple of Mollies, I came to the last package. 

Inside the small brown box was the store's weekly cricket shipment.  As per protocol, I had to empty the shipment into our big Tupperware containers and pick out the potatoes and heat packs.  The poor things were shipped all the way across the country from the store's vendor in Arizona.  So by the time they reached us, half of them were dead, and it was my job to pick them out by hand.  It took awhile to get use to the feeling of crickets crawling across my hands and arms whenever I opened the bin.  But overtime, you become accustomed to the sensation of crickets tickling your arm hair.    

Amongst the typical molts and decaying crickets were a couple of dry crickets that felt silky to the touch.  With my arms buried in the containers, a customer asked me a question about hamsters.  Midway through my explanation of wet-tail, I felt something *different* crawl over my arm.  It felt larger than the pin head crickets.  Yet it felt bigger, lighter...more delicate.  And it was crawling upwards, towards my sleeve.  I brushed it off and jumped back.  After regaining my composure and explaining the causes of ""wet tail"" to the customer, I looked at the container.  Inside was the typical sea of crickets climbing over each other.  Except for a wide space in the corner.  Standing alone was a hairless brown spider about the size of a quarter staring back at me.  With a sudden adrenaline rush, I crushed it with a brush.  

After a couple deep breaths, I quickly examined it's hairless, figure-eight body, delicate legs and weird coloration on its abdomen.  I threw it out quickly and got a smoke.  ""Cool down.  It was just a wolf spider. 
 *A wolf spider.*""

The next day, I brought up the Wolf Spider incident with my manager.  She laughed and told me that I got off easy.  Sarah told me that a couple years ago another guy in the animal department came across a brown recluse in a cricket shipment.  

'Brown recluse?'

""Hell-Yeah.  Brown spider, yeah big, with a violin pattern on its belly.  It could have killed Steve if he didn't act fast enough.  Nearly tore the district manager's head off for that one.""

Keep in mind, everyone involved are horror film buffs, out in the remote woods to make a horror film.  Several of the scares, even though we fell for them (and I attribute that to the fear we felt), are things that we were planning for the actual film shoot, before we cut it short.  We had all of the equipment and gear to pull it off (except for the sheer number of meat hooks that Chris/Tim/Whoever used - we still did have 6 on set, along with about 50 feet of heavy chain).

***

I tried to keep surveying the situation, not daring to move my head.  The knife that Tim held to my throat was sharp, and held just firmly enough that it didn't cut me, but would if the flesh contacting the blade moved.

Steve and Mike were still grunting, suspended from the rope.  Mike would occasionally let out a yelp of pain.  I couldn't turn my head to see them, but from the sounds, it appeared that they were struggling to escape.

I shifted my eyes towards Sara, wondering why she didn't just run.  I remembered from the audition that she had mentioned she was on the track team at TSU – surely she could outrun Tim and Chris.  She turned further towards where Mike and Steve were suspended.  It was then that I realized why she wasn't running.  Her wrists were bound tight and her legs had been bound together at the knees and ankles.  I'd seen enough horror films to know what usually followed for an unlucky person found in that predicament – suspension; hung by the wrists - mutilation and murder often followed.  

I looked back at Tim, his face near mine, his mouth curled in a twisted grin.

I looked back towards Chris as he rose from his seat.  All the while my mind was running a mile a minute, trying to figure out just how to get to Sara and incapacitate Chris and Tim.

Chris rose to full height and started to speak.  “So, you've finally reached the end.  Here we all are.  My, how the tables have turned.”

“This doesn't sound like Chris at all,” I thought.  I mean, it was his voice, but not the way he usually talks.  For starters, he never would have started a sentence with 'My.'

“It would seem that I have you at rather a disadvantage – Mike and Steve hanging there, kind of useless.  You have a knife at your throat.  Did I mention that Tim is one of the most brutal people I've ever met?  He's quite worthy of being a minion of Ereshkigal.  She is proud of him.  Jill was an acceptable sacrifice. Yes, Tim did that.”

I glanced back at Tim, whose grin twisted further into a maniacal smile, and he chuckled with a tone that scared the shit out of me.  It was one of those evil... no, demonic chuckles that is often the last thing a person would hear in a horror film.

Chris continued: “Now here we all are.  Inanna is bound and defenseless.  Without her clothes, she is weak.”  He approached Sara. “It's a shame, really.  Such a waste to have to destroy such beauty, such a perfect body.”

Steve shouted, “Get the fuck away from her!”

Chris chuckled and looked at Steve, “You're not really in a position to be demanding anything, are you?”

“Chris,” I started, “what is wrong with you?  Stop speaking in fucking film cliches and say something fucking useful.  Why are you doing this?”

“Why?”  Chris glared at me.  His eyes seemed to pierce my soul. “Why?” he asked loudly.  “Because this bitch...” he motioned towards Sara, pausing for a moment to look her up and down again.  “This bitch wants Ereshkigal's throne.  She won't give it up.  Ereshkigal chose me as her champion.  It is my duty to destroy Inanna. Ereshkigal wants to hang her as a decoration.”

“Ereshkigal isn't real, Chris.  She's a myth – part of an ancient religion.”  I tried to speak sense to him.  “Ereshkigal is just a story used by an ancient people to help explain the millions of things they didn't understand about the world. It's a story.  It's not real.”

“Silence,” Tim's voice boomed at me while he applied slightly more pressure to the knife.  I could feel a slight trickle of blood running down my neck.

Sara spoke for the first time since we found her, “Chris, my name is Sara.  I am not your Inanna.  Please, just let me go.  Let them go.  None of us will talk.  I promise.”

Chris glared at Sara as he slapped her across the face – hard.  Sara tumbled to the ground.

Chris, growing visibly more irate, pulled her forcefully to her feet.  “Shut up, bitch.  You will die tonight.”

Steve screamed in anger as he witnessed that.  I could hear the struggling from Steve and Mike intensify.

I heard a faint click of a lock-blade clicking into place from where Mike and Steve hung.

Chris continued, “Now you will shut up and only scream when I tell you to.”  He pulled a large bowie knife from behind him and started tracing the point up and down Sara's torso, between her breasts.

“You too,” Tim snarled in my ear.

Suddenly, there was a loud crash from just to the left of me.  Tim pulled the knife from my throat and his free hand clamped down in its place, his thumb pressing firmly on my windpipe.  I could barely breathe.

I turned to look and Mike and Steve had fallen to the ground.  Mike was frantically trying to cut the rope that bound their feet.  A split second later, they were free.

As I gasped for breath, I saw Mike streak towards Tim, driving his knife into Tim's shoulder.  Mike released his hand from my neck and I could breathe again.  Tim tumbled to the ground, Mike on top of him, twisting the knife.

Just as I coughed and shook my head as my breath returned to me, Steve tackled Chris.  As they went down, there was a scream of pain.  I couldn't tell who had screamed – Steve or Chris.

Sara tried to take a step back, due to instinct, I'd guess.  She fell backwards as her bound legs failed to part so she could take a step and keep her balance.

It all happened so fast that it took me a second to realize what was happening.  I stepped to the right, and kicked Tim in the side of the head as hard as I could. I'm sure the steel toes in the boots I was wearing didn't feel good.

Mike started to get up, pulling his knife from Tim's shoulder. “Damn man, I think you knocked him out.  I hope you didn't kill him.”  He rose to his feet as the struggle between Steve and Chris continued.

“I hope I did.” I said gravely as Mike and I turned our attention to the struggle between Steve and Chris.

Before joining Mike in running towards Steve and Chris, I picked up Tim's knife. If he wasn't dead, I wasn't about to allow him to be armed.

I rushed towards Steve and Chris, arriving less than a second after Mike did.  Mike had already dove into the fray, slamming down his knife as hard as he could.  There was another scream of pain, and Chris fell still.  

Mike and Steve started to get up.  Steve winced in pain as he tried to support himself with his right arm.  Finally, Steve reached his feet, a gash running across his chest, starting at his shoulder and running nearly to his navel.  It was bleeding heavily.

“He got me,” Steve paused for a moment.  “He got me good. This shit hurts.”

Before he finished, I had my t-shirt off and started trying to bandage his wound. My shirt wasn't enough.  Mike noticed that, and removed his shirt as well, tossing it to me.  Between both shirts, I was able to at least get enough of a makeshift bandage on Steve to slow the bleeding.

“I told you I knew first aid,” I smirked at Steve.

“That knot looks like shit.  Are you sure?” Steve smirked back at me.

“Sara, are you okay?” Mike asked as he started to undo her bindings.

“I... I think so,” she started. “I feel woozy.”  She was able to get up and keep her feet, but appeared to be a little glassy-eyed.

“Baby, are you sure you're okay?” Steve started.  He embraced her.  “Please be okay.  What did Chris do to you?”

“Steve... oh... it was horrific,” Sara started.  “After I ran after Jill...” She paused again, obviously traumatized.  “After I ran after Jill... the blood... Jill... her body...” She paused again, taking a deep breath.  “I can't... I don't want to talk about it right n...”

“Rule number... one...” the low, gravelly voice came from behind us, “of a horror film is that...”

We turned around.  Tim was getting to his feet. “... the bad guy never... dies.” He stood to his full height and pulled out my Leatherman, blade already locked in place (fuck, I forgot to take my Leatherman).

As Tim stood up, Mike and I readied our knives again.

The four of us stared at Tim.  Tim stared at us.  Silence.  What seemed like an eternity later, Tim's eyes narrowed to slits, an evil grin spread across his face, and he lunged at Mike.

Without thinking, Mike thrust his knife into Tim's stomach and both of them tumbled to the ground.  Tim stopped moving and Mike pushed him off.

As Mike got back to his feet, blood spread across Tim's wet shirt.

We looked back towards Chris.  He was still laying motionless, blood soaking his shirt from a wound at the base of his neck.

“We need to go.”  I said.  “Fuck these two.  They can rot out here for all I care.”

“Did you bring my clothes?” Sara asked.  I think it was a fair question.

Steve looked sheepishly at her.  “Uh, no?  Wait, your panties are just up that slope.”

“We can give her one of the robes,” I offered.

We headed back towards where we found the seventh portal.  As we got there, Steve retrieved Sara's underwear from the ground.  “It's wet, but it's a start,” he said.

We continued to try and retrace our steps, shortly after finding the white robes in the trees.  We took one down and Sara was finally able to cover herself.

We kept trying to retrace our steps.  As dusk fell, we found ourselves lost.  At least we weren't being pursued and we had everyone that was still alive.

We tried to sleep in a small clearing with some rocks and low brush as cover.  The rain had finally stopped, and even though it was wet and muddy, sleep still came quickly for all of us.

The next morning, we tried to continue in a straight line, and eventually found the road by early afternoon.

It was over.

47,My Friend's Attic,1301431312,"Let me start by saying I never believed in ghosts, spirits, even God or the Devil. My experiences at my friend house have made me realize that our understanding the the Universe is incomplete and there are some things going on that cannot be explained by the current model of reality.

So we often hang out in my friends attic (My username might clue you in on why). One night it's just me, him, and his cousin that lives in the house. We were sitting around talking and suddenly I felt cold. This wasn't a feeling like the temperature changed, it was a chill that is very hard to explain. I look over at my friend and he is just petrified. The fear on my face freaked me out, then I look over to his cousin.

Guys, this is extremely hard to explain and I know I cannot coherently describe what I saw in his face, but it was something paranormal. 

The cousin was looking right at me and his face was formed into a look that could be best characterized by ""evil."" But it didn't just look evil, if FELT evil. Like it was peering into my soul and doing very bad things. I broke his gaze after being immediately petrified and I could not bring myself to look back at him. I make eye contact with my friend and I can tell he is truly freaked out. We ask the cousin what he is doing and he says ""oh its just The Face""

A big reason this ordeal was so frightening is that HE KNEW HE WAS DOING IT. Whatever IT was.

We basically beg him to stop and he does. We leave the attic and go on with our night. 

That's pretty much it, so it isn't the most intense /nosleep story on here, but ever since that day I cannot ignore the fact that I experienced something supernatural.

I have discussed this event with my friend since and we agree that we witnessed some kind of interaction with a spirit that manifested itself in his cousin.

“Davey, Im all packed up. Im taking my lap-top with me, in case you finally decide to show up on MSN. Where are you, anyway? Im leaving in a few minutes. Ill email you when i get there.”

February 21st, 2004, 21:41 pm

“Dave, my aunt is so scary looking! I had already seen pictures of her, but one-on-one its totally different! She does seem like a good person though. She lives all alone in this very big and very old house, a bit isolated from the village. It looks as if the house is 100 years old! Or more! Haha. My room has an outside view to the woods. Sure does look beautiful at night... i wish we could share this moment...
Its also a dirty shame i cant go to the village and meet people, since my leg is hurt.
For now, i´ll be spending most of the time at home. Thank God for the internet...”

22nd February, 2004, 8:55 am

“Hi, im really energetic today! I think i might do some exploring over this house. That is, if my leg isn't a bitch about it!”

22nd of February, 2004, 9:07 am

“My aunt leaves everyday to go shopping. She doesnt talk much. Doesnt get visits, no one calls her. In fact, i think she doesnt even have a phone!
I saw something really odd after she left, a while ago. I was starring through my bedroom window and i could see my aunt walking towards the village. Do you believe people actually crossed the street when she got near them? Thats really odd. Or is it just a coincidence?
By the way, why arent you answering back? Hope everything´s ok.
I´ll continue to e-mail you though, just in case...”

22nd of February, 2004, 11:20 am

“Dave, this house is awesome!!!! It really must be as old as i thought!
One of the rooms on the ground floor is locked... You know how curious i am. I think i´ll try to find the key!""

22nd February, 2004, 15:40 pm

“I tried looking for the key after lunch, but i couldnt find it! This place is so big it could be anywhere. Bummer.
Im feeling a bit tired, im gonna take a nap. Cya later...”

22nd February, 2004, 21:07 pm

""My aunt finally arrived! I thought i was gonna starve to death!
I wonder why she took so long...
However, i dont have the guts to ask her. We have kind of an awkward relationship. Its weird.
Im gonna have dinner now...""

23rd February, 2004, 01:31 am

“I was trying to sleep, but i cant. From my bed, you can see the moonlight coming through the window, and it projects the weirdest shapes against it. I think there's rope hanging from a tree. Its really creepy...”

23rd February, 2004, 02:30 am

“Dave! Im really scared! I was close to falling asleep when i heard strange noises. I tried calling for my aunt, but she didnt answer, so i went to check out what was doing that.
The noises were coming from that locked room! I pressed my ear against the door, trying to hear. It sounded like a person with asthma, breathing very heavily! I heard footsteps coming from inside and i tried to get away without making any noise, but with a casted leg its very hard! I hid behind this china cabinet and I could see my aunt come out of the room, looking around. She was kinda looking in my direction but i don't think she saw me.
I'm not really sure but i think i saw blood on her hands. She entered the room again, and i quickly came here. I´m petrified!
If you are there, please, say something!”



23rd February, 2004, 11:41 am

“Hey, i just had breakfast a few minutes ago...
I was thinking, maybe im being a bit dilusional. Maybe it wasnt blood on her hands i saw...
I dunno, maybe she was preping something for lunch. I did see a big piece of meat on the counter in the kitchen today. It looked like pork.
Anyway, i was reading one of the e-mails you sent me when we were going out, and that really relaxed me. I was so creeped out by how the silence here is so heavy at night, that any noise scares me, and my imagination just ran wild.
You still havent e-mailed back. Maybe youre not home, i guess...
Im gonna watch Tv. I´ll e-mail you later.”

23rd February, 2004, 18:22 pm

“Wow, i think i just slept for 4 hours straight... This is was the most relaxed time i had here since i arrived. And that was only 2 days ago! Theres something peculiar about this house...
Im feeling a bit nauseous and my leg is really itchy. I tried to open the window but i couldnt. It was stuck. Im heading down to eat something. Im hungry.”

23rd February, 2004, 20:56 pm

“ I cant believe this. Theres nothing here to eat! My aunt still hasnt returned from shopping.
Also, theres a strange atmosphere in this house. Its darker than usual. Normally at this hour, its still moderately bright outside, but now its dark like its almost midnight. Maybe its because all the windows are closed, but i cant open any of them. Im getting a bit upset.”

23rd February, 2004, 21:00 pm

""My aunt hasnt come back yet! I hate being alone. Plus, im starving! I cant wait for her to get here already!”

23rd February, 2004, 21:29 pm

“You wont believe this! I found a key! I think it belongs to that room! Im gonna check it out. Ill be right back!""

23rd February, 2004, 21:50 pm

""There´s a crapload of creepy books about the occult and paranormal there! I also noticed a closet. There was this horrible smell coming from it. Maybe there´s something rotten there. Still no word from my aunt.”

23rd February, 2004, 22:22 pm

“Fuck this! My aunt is nowhere to be seen and the power went out. I think my laptop´s battery is almost drained. I´ll keep emailing you till the batery´s dead.
I just heard something downstairs. Its probably her. Please, let it be her...”

23rd February, 2004, 22:30 pm

“It wasnt her. I dont know what it was.
I wish you were here cause im starting to get frightened.
I had to drag myself to the room because i tripped, fell and hurt my leg even more.
Im ok now, i guess...
Im hearing noises but i have no idea where they´re coming from. Its honestly creeping me out.
Im gonna lay here, quite, until my aunt gets back...”

23rd February, 2004, 23:11 pm

“I keep hearing noises coming from the bedroom near mine, like someone is dragging something. Ive yelled for help, cried, but i got no answer...Im not feeling ok... terrible ache on my leg... im hungry... I think i can walk now. Im gonna head to the hall to see who´s there. Maybe its my aunt. Im taking the laptop as well.
Dave, if youre reading this, please say something, please...”

23rd February, 2004, 23:14 pm

“im on the hall now. noises from the other room. im feeling dizzy. where are you. i need help.”

23rd February, 2004, 23:17

“the locked room. closet opened has altar with blood. somebody is here.”

23rd February, 2004, 23:19

“theres bowels on altar like intestines. my aunt. i think i saw her.”


23rd February, 2004, 23:21

",nosleep,Coveiro,/r/nosleep/comments/ge6mv/jills_aunt/
49,Why I refuse to work late anymore,1301428406,"I used to work for a marketing firm located in the Back Bay section of Boston. It was a small company, but large enough that we operated on an entire floor of the building we rented, and that I was not familiar with everyone else who worked there. I started in 2007 as part of their web-based media team. For those of you who don't know anything about the marketing business, it's very client-driven. A team of producers sell our services to companies, often a little over-zealously, and the designers and developers typically have to work like slaves to meet the producers' promises. This can mean late nights, taking a cab home because the commuter rail has shut down. It also means coming in on weekends and working late then too.

It was November of 2008, and we had a big promotional site being developed for a rather important client. I'm not at liberty to give out the details surrounding the project, but it's not relevant to this story anyway. What's relevant is that the client was pushy, as most are, and the site was complex, so I ended up having to come in on a Saturday and work late into the evening to have something ready to present by Monday. If you've ever worked in an office on the weekend, you know just how different and isolated it can feel. There were other people at first, ambitious or merely driven, doing their thing but never our paths did cross.

The office was organized in patches of cubicles. We developers tend to be a little off kilter, goofy, prone to coming in wearing t-shirts and faded jeans. The higher ups put us in the back corner so that tours with potential clients could avoid having to explain us and our appearance to them. The corner just happened to be facing the alleyway between our building and the next one. The back row of cubicles eventually got replaced with an aesthetically pleasing row of glassed-in offices for the director of the web-based media team and some selected subordinates, but at the time of this tale there was only her dark office and a row of grungy cubicles where said subordinates vied for leg room with piping and windows looking out at the brick facade of the adjoining structure. The lighting in our section was often dim. My coworkers liked to loosen any fluorescents that flickered rather than request a change of bulb. My own cubicle was on the far side of the area from the beautiful brick vista, smack dab in a corner with a set of shelves. I only warranted half the space of a regular cubicle because I was the newest member of the team. Seated at my computer, a radiator warming my toes and my back to the rest of the office, I worked on the site.

It was a little after midday when the producer called me to check on the status of the project. The nice producers came in and stuck around to show their support when you had to come in on weekends. Sometimes they'd go pick up lunch or dinner to reduce your downtime. The not-so nice ones called and encouraged you while they went shopping or played golf. Things were going well, and I told her as much. While she began droning on about a list of features I should remember to have implemented, I heard a noise behind me. It sounded like chains rattling, which I thought was an unusual sound for someone to be making, which is why I got up after finishing the conversation and hanging up and went into the kitchen area to investigate. The kitchen separated our section from the graphic designer group, and was at the end of a large open hall that had several meeting rooms attached before ending on the other side at the lobby with the front desk and elevator. There was an old freight elevator right by the kitchen side of the hall, but we usually avoided using it because of its tendency to break down. There was nobody in the kitchen, but as I turned to look down the hall toward the front desk, I saw the door to the freight elevator coming to a close. At the same moment it closed completely, I spotted a coworker heading for the lobby elevator. They turned at the sound of the freight elevator door shutting, saw me, and waved.

""Don't forget to turn on the security alarm before you leave,"" he said.

""Am I the last one here?"" I asked. He nodded and headed for the elevator. When I got back to my desk, the phone was off the hook. I chalked it up at the time to me being forgetful, but I wonder now if it was something else. The line was making that EHN EHN noise you hear when you've left it off the hook for too long, so I hung it up and went back to work.

It got dark out and I still wasn't done, so I called my wife to tell her I would be working late and to go ahead and eat without me. As I hung up the phone, I heard a creaking sound, like door hinges. I was feeling a little creeped out by being all alone, so I got up and went back to the kitchen area to see if someone had come in. If they had, and I left before them, I wouldn't want to activate the alarm. Between the cubicles and the kitchen is a very tight hallway which is where the restrooms are found. As I passed it, I saw the men's room door coming to a close, like I had just missed someone going in. I waited in that spot for about five minutes, trying to look nonchalant about standing around, like I was trying to do something instead of just watching to see the person come back out. Finally, feeling increasingly anxious, I walked down the dark hall and slowly opened the men's room door with the planned excuse of what the hell, I had to go and this is a bathroom. The bathroom wasn't just empty, it was pitch black. The lights had been out since I came in that morning, and nobody had turned them on. Walking into pitch black unexpectedly like that can really put you in a state, let me tell you. Suddenly being blind when you were able to see just a moment ago. It was like the air got sucked out of me. HHHHUUUPPP and I realized I was holding my breath because everything was dead silent and my ears had sensitized in the hope of catching even the slightest sound. I stood there a second and then turned on my heel and got out of the restroom back into the hallway where I clutched the wall like I was afraid it was going to fall away and leave me back in that infinite blackness. I wasn't even thinking about whether anyone else was watching me at that point.

I couldn't tell you why I was scared at the time, I just was. I did not like being alone in that office. I knew that right outside was a brightly lit city, but somehow it all seemed really far away.  The T station was a block away. I could run to it and be home in a couple hours, but then I'd have to explain to the producer that I wasn't done the site because I got scared, and she was sure to tell everyone else and I'd be laughed out of the office. 

I flipped the light switch to the restroom there in the hall and went back in. The men's room was about the size of two of our cubicles and even grungier than the alley back behind the office. There were two stalls, a pair of urinals and a trio of sinks with a wall-length mirror. I hated the urinals because one was right by the door and I felt like people passing by could see in while I went. The other was made for a midget. Even though I was alone, I went and sat down in the stall. I also just felt the need to sit and relax a moment. 

I was just beginning to relax when I heard the door creak again, followed by footsteps on the tiles. I was relieved by the sound, because it meant I wasn't alone. Someone else *had* come in, and all that sudden fear was just me being irrational. I cleared my throat, a tradition I do sort of to say ""this stall is occupied."" The moment I made the sound, the footsteps stopped. I suddenly felt a little anxious again. I cleared my throat a little less obviously, to make it seem less like an introduction and more like I just had a bit of congestion. The footsteps suddenly began to get closer. When it sounded like they were right outside my stall, they came to a stop. I got real tense and leaned down to look at the person's shoes.

There weren't any.

At that moment, I got goosebumps on my arms and my heart rose up into my throat. My stomach was doing cartwheels, but I went about the routine of finishing up, flushing and opening the stall door. The room was empty. I went over to the sink and began washing my hands, constantly looking over my shoulder and around the room in the mirror. I went to the hand dryer and started it up and was rubbing my hands together when I heard another sound right behind me. I could see in the reflective chrome of the dryer nozzle... the other stall door was shut where before it had been wide open. At that point, I didn't care whether my hands were wet or not, I wiped them on my pants and turned for the door out of that room. The whole space felt smaller, more confined, and as I walked past the stalls, I heard the click of the lock and the stall door started swinging open as if to greet me. I didn't look in, I didn't want to see even if there was somebody there, I just ran the last few feet, yanked the door open as hard as I could and bolted down the dark hall back to the safety of my computer.

When I got back to the desk, my phone was off the hook again. I could hear someone speaking even before I picked it up. I put it to my ear and listened.

""At the tone, it will be 7:43.""

I held the phone there, listening for the mentioned tone. I turned and watched the hallway I had just come from, though from my desk I couldn't see down it. There were no other sounds except the hiss of the radiator and the computer fan. The recorded voice played again, but this time it was different. It sounded like one of those old casette tape players when you only held the play button halfway down. It was deeper and slower and I did not feel any comfort in it anymore.

""At the tone, it will be 7:43.""

I hung up. At that point, I decided that I did not want to be there anymore, and I didn't care if I got laughed at later for it. I grabbed my satchel and saved my work. Just as I told Windows to shut down, the phone rang. Instinctively, I picked it up, figuring it was the producer calling. I'd just tell her I'd come in tomorrow and finish it, that's what I'd do.

""At the tone, it will be 7:45."" said the voice. I hung up and pulled the cord out. The phone at the desk next to mine rang. I ignored it and grabbed my shit to get the fuck out of there. I decided as I walked that my best course of action was to go into the kitchen, walk the long hallway to the front desk and wait for the elevator. Then I remembered that I had to set the alarm. The alarm pad was past the elevator, around a corner, back by the executive offices. Not a big problem, I thought. As I walked past the dark hall toward the kitchen, I looked down it just to make myself feel better.

The door to the men's room was wide open.

Worse, it was pitch black inside again, but I realized as I stopped and looked that I had never turned it off. The linchpin in my horror came when the door suddenly began to slowly shut, as if it had been waiting for me as an audience before doing so. I turned away and went into the kitchen, trying not to think about the fact that the men's room was just on the other side of the wall from the hallway I was about to go down. I looked down the hall at the front desk and the elevator out of there and it never seemed so far away before. I took a step, and from behind came another sound that sent shivers down my spine: the crash bar on the fire escape being pushed. I turned 180. The fire escape was located right next to the director's office, and was just about two rows of cubicles away from the kitchen area. As I watched, the door to the fire stairs down the back of the building swung slowly open into darkness. I turned back toward the hall and ran. The sound of a ding indicated the arrival of the freight elevator, and as I passed it, its doors slowly began to open, just like the stall door in the bathroom. I heard the sound of rattling chains from inside, but I did not look.

I was running. Running for that front desk. Running for the elevator down to the lobby. When I got there, I slammed into the wall between the elevator doors and punched at the down button desperately. I turned back to look where I came from. Every time I do, I think of Lot's wife in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. You *never* fucking look back. Ever.

The back area of the office was bathed in blackness. I could not see it at all. There was some light coming into the kitchen from the developer area, but even as I stood there watching, it seemed to fade and become dark. I looked at the elevator floor indicator and prayed that the approaching car was brightly illuminated. 2... 3... 4. The ding of its arrival was beautiful. The doors opened to a well-lit salvation. I scrambled into the elevator and frantically hammered at the ground floor button. As the doors slowly started closing, I watched the encroaching darkness seem to swallow the office. When the car reached the ground floor, I was squashed down into the corner, terrified that it would at any moment fill the compartment and eat me. I bolted through the lobby and out onto the street where I promptly threw up, grossing out a passing cyclist who yelled words of encouragement as he continued down the street.

I did not return to the office the next day. I told the producer I had gotten violently sick, and she talked the client into extending the deadline. I got chastised for forgetting to set the alarm, but no harm was done. Three months later, they reorganized the back area of the office, built the subordinates' offices, tore down a wall between our section and the kitchen and set the cubicles up in a more standard format, moving me from my little corner by the dark hallway. I never went down that hallway again. In the remaining year that I was there, if I had to go, I walked down to the front desk and took the elevator down a floor where there was a public access restroom. Much bigger, much cleaner, much brighter, and far less haunted.",nosleep,wdalphin,/r/nosleep/comments/ge5wo/why_i_refuse_to_work_late_anymore/
50,My mother lived in a haunted house in college,1301427718,"Last weekend my mother's college roommate Joni was in town. Joni is the type of great college friend you make for life but don't see nearly often enough after you graduate. So we all got pretty drunk and were just shooting the shit telling hilarious college stories late into the evening. 

My buddy was with me and he went to Ohio University as well, they got to talking about where he lived during undergard etc. Well after he told them, they both immediately started talking about this old as fuck house they lived in their junior year, in 1977.

They both got that real serious grievous look on their faces that drunk people get when they think they're saying something real or profound. They began to regale us with the shit that happened in that house. 

They said they were both, along with their 2 other roommates were immediately convinced they had at least 1 poltergeist fucking with them from day one. 
They both said that every door had an unexplainable ability to close itself after you opened it. That was the first thing they noticed. The second was that their combs kept disappearing. Joni said that one time she was watching tv and the channel changed. This was the 70s and the tv had a nob on it that you had to forcefully change to the next channel. She said she saw the nob turn and heard the click, freaked the fuck out and left.

They joked that the poltergeist hated the news, but I could tell that even after all these years they were still visibly upset talking about it. My mother said she first started to believe when her clock's alarm would change (it was a manual winding one with the two bells on top) once or twice a week.

Mom said all doubt was removed when she got back from winter break earlier than her roommates and when she first entered the house, she says she heard her name clear as a bell and in a loud, happy, boisterous voice, ""THERESE!""

She said the fucking thing not only was there, but it knew them, and missed them. She was the only one in the house that night, but when she woke up in the morning and went into the kitchen the refrigerator was cocked a bit sideways, and underneath it she could see a comb sticking out. She pulled the refrigerator out and found like 15 combs they had lost throughout their first quarter.

They both said they all just tried to include the poltergeist in their conversations and greeted it when they entered into a room alone and the combs stopped going missing and alarm clocks stopped being changed.

The night before they moved out, they had a oiji board party (the exorcist was big at the time so I guess they were all the rage) They said that everyone was having a great time but when my mom and Joni got their turn to play with it, they asked it a stupid question and were trying to make it give the answer they wanted to make it funny but they couldn't move the oiji eye. They said at first they nudged it and it didn't move, they initially thought they just weren't on the same page. So they both pushed hard and it still didn't move. They freaked out and Joni backed away. My mother said she slapped the oiji board piece and instead of flying across the room it just slid off the table with the board still attached underneath it, like it was magnetized.

They said everyone freaked out and they put the board away, with the piece still attached and all.

51,Dark Reflection,1301423421,"I had only about an hour left of work before I could go home so I was reshopping stuff (I work in a grocery store) and it was pretty empty considering it was a Monday night.  I was putting some cold stuff away and I saw something dark pass behind me from the reflection of some of the metal.

I turned around, just for curiosity's sake, and saw no one.  I shrugged and figured they went down a aisle or something.  I put the stuff away and continued my trip of putting stuff away.  

Later, I was around the same area and I saw the black reflection again but it went by slower.  I didn't turn around because I started getting weirded out and figured if it was a customer they would speak up if they needed help.  A few moments go by and the dark reflection is gone.  I finally turn around and see noone.  By now, my skin has goosebumps, and they aren't from the cold of the freezer.

I only had five mins left of work so I was trying to find something to do so I can waste my time and so I wouldn't look like I was slacking off.  Then my manager comes up to me and asks me to take some meat back and I do (how can I refuse?).  

I'm still thinking of what had happened the last two times I was putting stuff away in that area.  I figured I'd put it away and be done with it.  Of course, as soon as I got in the area I noticed some asshat had totally screwed up all the meat and had just made a mess.  I started putting them back.  It took only under a min but when I looked up at the reflection I saw it.

That dark reflection was there, and this time it was completely still and right behind me.  I felt a coldness around me that was *not* from the freezer.  It was much colder then anything I had ever felt before and I was so scared.

In the reflection I could make out a disorted version of my face, but with the thing that was behind me, it was all black.  I was terrified, and unsure what to do.  Finally I turned away, ready to kick or punch at whatever was behind me.

There was nothing there.  Never had I ever been so relieved in my life than at that moment.  I actually had to move away from that aisle and calm down before heading to the front end to clock out.  By the time I left, it felt like it had been a dream but I don't think I'll be going in the meat section anytime soon if I don't have to.",nosleep,Inumaru12,/r/nosleep/comments/ge3we/dark_reflection/

55,The Ode of Ol' Jack O' Bones. (A poem),1301412523,"The Ode of Ol’ Jack O’ Bones
For those of you down on you're luck  finding yourselves traveling streets home to a vagrant lot You may find a queer little shop home to mysterious bric’ a ’brac owned by a sot.

But it is not of such a store you need be warned but rather the man who resides on its side. He’ll look out of place he’ll look out of time, in a silk top hat suit and bow tie.

And when on him your gaze does lie he’ll raise a gloved hand, beckons you to his side, and you’ll feel compelled you will not know why as he leads you round back where a table does lie.

And when you open your mouth to ask him why you're behind the shop with bric’ a ’brac inside he will spin ‘round it will come as a surprise for under the top hat grins a skull with azure eyes.

You may be shocked a jaw dropped  you may find before your mind chides it must be a mask a face it does hide.

“Hullo my lad” he’ll begin with a cry in his accent a bit of cockney and mockery does reside. “My names Ol’ Jack O’ Bones and you're wondering why behind the shop 
we now reside.”

When acknowledgment your mouth does provide he will begin again holding laughter inside         “ Why to play a game I think you will find the prize is quite worth it for it is what your heart decides.”
When agreement you provide he will sweep his top hat from where it lies. In the blink of an eye his hand dives right in returning with cards fifty-two, to begin.

And with deck in hand his show does begin almost an illusion, a dance does begin in front of your eyes a dextrous show so precise no man should ever think to try. And from his hands the cards do fly landing on the table forming perfect rows before your eyes. 

And he will give you a start when you catch his eyes he lets out a laugh when all the cards on the table lie. the skull will grin but it wont touch the eye’s before he begins.

“ The rules are quite simple I do not lie one of us must find where a big red heart does reside you may go first and then so shall I until one of us lays eyes on the prize.”
And then you will ask the price of this game and he will say with chuckle and grin “I think you will find that win or lose by the end I will have taken a fine now let’s begin.”

And so then shall you avert your eyes the table you will scan searching from on high until finally on a card your gaze does lie.
You will reach out a hand turning card to its side you will then let out a gasp of surprise for the red ace of hearts a big red heart under the card does reside.

You will say with a grin I guess this game is mine and Ol’ Jack O’ Bones will ask “But my lad why?”
You will pick up the card hold the ace to those azure eyes. 

“If that was the goal” he will begin with a sigh “of this game of mine then my lad first turn would have been mine turn another card and you will see why.”

And then as if compelled by some kind of force you’ll turn of the next card and next of course and you give into panic, a cry you will rise for under each card the red ace of hearts does lie.

And once every card lays on its opposite side they will seem to pulse before your eye’s “The point of the game is to find where a big red heart does reside but that it was under the cards was not specified.”

And he will pull of a glove under which bone does lie “And now my lad the next turn is mine” out goes his hand with your chest it does collide. 

And the last thing you will hear before the shade takes your eyes
Is Ol’ Jack O’ Bones saying with a sigh “ My what a big red heart  resides in your insides.”

And so you have been warned by this tale O’ mine beware the skull with the Azure eyes for the heart he seeks on no table does lie but it sleeps still beating within your insides.

56,Fever Dreams in India,1301406262,"Heya, first time poster here.  I've been having creepy times for the last couple of weeks at my workplace.  I currently work graveyard shifts in a women housing building in a rough area of town.  But this story isn't about how haunted my building is, this is about some creepiness that happened to me in India.

In 2007, I was sent to teach computer animation at a college close to Delhi.  It was the first time that I had ever been in Asia, and I was posted far away from my head office in Ahmadabad, with no other Canadians, and with only my local headmistress to look out for me.    This was also the first time that I had travelled alone, and as a half asian woman, I attracted a lot of attention.  

After finishing my first contract in Pune, I was sent up to Gurgoan to work.  My Headmistress, after I had been introduced to my students, asked me to come into her office.  She told me men outnumbered women by the millions, and because of how I was perceived, because my schedule  let out in the middle of the day while all the other women were at work, I might be the only woman around for kilometres.  Make sure no one followed me home.

As it goes, I got along with my male coworkers.  One of them decided to take me out to a great chicken tikka place, and even though the food was delicious, I ate some of the salad and got really sick.  So sick, had to stay in the hotel room for days.  My thermometer read 40 degrees Celsius.  

When I could stand between trips to the bathroom, I would force myself to stand under the cold stream of the shower just to cool myself down to 37.  It was so disgustingly hot, that I had to attempt sleep, sprawling on top of the covers, exhausted.  I didn't have a window in that hotel, my mom would call me at odd hours to make sure I was conscious.

And every time I my lids closed, I could feel my eyes jerking around in my head as though the dreams were starting before I even fell asleep.  And the dreams were relentless.  I remember the first one the best.  I'm being led by an unseen force, and I'm flying over a road.  I come across a dead child.  And many people were walking past this child, and the whole scene was terribly quiet, and matter of fact.  Next came dead people in trenches, victims of some war or violence.  And my hands dripping with their blood.

The problem with being delirious is that you can't wake up.  And it feel like I was being shown these things, and it wasn't just a dream, I was hallucinating.  I'd had sleep paralysis in Canada, and I desperately wanted to avoid that.  

After a couple or days, the school moved me into a proper flat, and my fever had finally started to break.  I remember the move involveng me, and my co-workers travelling in a Tempo, which is like a suped up autorickshaw, me trying not to start vomiting again becuase of the bumpiness of the trip.  I felt a little weird too, because I totally let the drivers see where I lived, against the advice of my headmistress.

I figured with this room I'd have a fresh start, and I knew a little woo from growing up in Vancouver.  I painted the walls of my new room with a finger dipped in lavender oil, writing stars and praying, and I made sure that I painted the sill of the door.  I'm glad I did.  

That night, after a co worker had dropped off some white rice and 7-Up, I tried sleeping, but because I was sweating, I kept the door open and left the screen door shut.  

I remember waking and sitting up in my bed.  And outside my room was a man staring at me.  I was about to start screaming and raising bloody murder, because he was on my terrace, and I didn't have an escape route.  And then I noticed that he was too tall for an Indian, and there was something wrong with his face.  He had a black iris sitting in a blood shot sclera, so red I understood why they tell you that demons have red eyes.  

I sat in the darkness watching him stare at me, transfixed by him, my heart pumping in my throat, and that was the loudest noise in the room, because he was unnaturally still.  But though he was standing at my open door, I could feel that he wanted to get in, but he couldn't. 

I heard somewhere that the best defence against the supernatural is ignorance, and with a shaky hand, I reached for my ipod, slipped in the earbuds, and lay down again to some music.  The next time I looked up, he was gone.  But I will always remember his eyes.

57,Cords,1301387691,"I hate cords. I'm too lazy to bundle them up such that they're outta the way, but am also notoriously clumsy , so I trip over them all the time.  I've destroyed multiple computer sockets and nearly trashed a laptop this way. The worst of 'em all is the one for my headphones. It's something like 10 ft long, but my computer is only 3 ft away, so I'm always getting tangled up in it. I once nearly got a concussion from slamming my head into the closet door next to my desk after tripping over it.

I've been doing it a lot more lately. My cat went missing a few days ago, so I'm worrying about where she is instead of remembering that I need to untangle myself before getting out of my chair. Yesterday, as I was getting up to get some water I felt it wrapped around my ankle like a little tentacle, chaining me to my computer as I tried to take my first steps. I fell again.... damnit...

But as I was getting, I remembered that I hadn't been using my headphones. I rolled over and saw them resting atop my computer case, the cord safely nestled between the case and my desk. I looked down at my foot and saw nothing tangled around it. And then I heard the closet door click shut.

58,A Walk in the Park.,1301380582,"I'm standing in the middle of the road watching a squirrel eating nuts while at the park walking my dog. I see a man walking up with an odd walk and demeanor. I stay in the road in a relaxed fashion. I turn my head to face him when he comes into view, his top lip has two lip-like flap projections hanging off it.

""Can I take that from your dog?"" He says, while motioning at the chunk of wood my dog has. He comes close so that I can see his ever feature.

I walk awkwardly into my dog to avoid his path, fearstruck. ""No, he likes that one.""

I quickly dart into an unsuspecting path when out of sight after checking the path behind me. I search the side of the road for the strongest stick I can find, if he takes me from a run he could easily have a chance. 

A family is rolling a stroller in the distance, a golden retriever approaches me and wags his tail. He gnaws at the stick. I give it to him. Give myself, defenseless to the universe. Watch my stick disappear with the family. Walk to the top of a hill and look over the ocean naked to the world.",nosleep,redditor3000,/r/nosleep/comments/gdr4q/a_walk_in_the_park/

The story is still around mid-late Thursday afternoon.  Less than 12 hours has passed since way back in part 2.  We had just discovered the 6th portal, Jill's body (again), and the all-encompassing laughter had come back.  I had just announced the direction we needed to go in, but wasn't sure I had been heard through the laughter.

***

Steve heard me.  He started rushing in the direction I had pointed in.  He had developed a limp.  Perhaps he had actually hurt himself in his slide down the muddy mountainside.  He wasn't saying though.

I kept supporting Mike and we rushed as best we could with Mike's injured leg. With my free hand, suspecting that we were close, I pulled out my flashlight and turned it on.  I only had a few hours worth of battery power, but I figured that now, more than ever, we needed the extra light, even with as little as it was.

I cast the beam around, mostly towards Steve, who was about fifty feet ahead of Mike and I – I didn't want to lose track of him.

As I cast the light around, I noticed more of the robed figures.  Knowing that the first one we saw was nothing but a robe on branches, I didn't think much of them – and neither did anyone else, it seemed. The strange part was that even though the wind and rain were blowing towards us, the robes of the figures seemed to be dry, and billowing towards where we were headed.

The laughter continued.  I, frankly, was sick of hearing it.  By this point it had grown so loud that it nearly drowned out the sound of the thunderstorm.

“Steve, slow down.  We're losing you!” I called ahead.

Steve, who I could just barely still see when I shined my flashlight in his direction, replied, “We're close.  I need to find Sara!”

“Do you want to face Chris and Tim by yourself?” I asked loudly.  “If you lose us, we may not be able to find you again!”

“Then hurry the fuck up!”  The voice was not Steve's.  It sounded like the low, gravelly voice we had heard coming through the speaker earlier.

Mike and I ignored it while trying to quicken our pace.  Mike was obviously in increasing pain the more we ran.

“Steve, talk to me!” I shouted.  “That wasn't you!  Steve!  Can you still hear us?”

“Yes, I can,” came Steve's voice. “Catch up.  I found something.  I think it's the next portal.”

A few minutes later, Mike and I finally caught up to Steve.  Just as we did, the rain started to lighten up significantly.  That's not unusual in mountain rainstorms, at least not from what I've read and heard about them.  At the same time, the laughter died off to barely audible levels, seeming like it would quit soon.

It seemed ever so barely brighter in the forest, and the thunder and lightning seemed to have started to move off into the distance.  Even so, it was nearing 6:00pm, which, even while still well before dusk, light levels, even in sunny areas started to lessen as the sun moved towards the horizon.  The woods were still dark. The clouds had not broken, though they seemed a little less black.

Steve, turning back to see Mike and I approach, started to slowly walk forward. “Will you look at that?” he said softly.

“What?” I started to question just as Mike and I caught up with him – then Mike and I saw it as well.  It was at this point that the laughter finally ended.

It was the seventh portal.  Two trees, growing about five feet apart, rocky outcropping surrounding their bases, the mountain dropping off sharply just beyond it.  Between the two trees were lashed several branches and uprooted young trees. The branches and young trees were lashed to the two older trees at about six feet in the air.  They had been formed upwards to meet at a central point, the apex, about ten feet in the air.  From the apex hung a length of chain, about four feet long, with a meat hook hanging from the end of it.

The meat hook, we expected.  What I saw when I scanned the structure with my flashlight was what we didn't expect.  Both of the large trees, from the point the arch was lashed to, reaching all the way to the ground, was covered in early [Sumerian cuneiform](http://i.imgur.com/cK3SS.jpg) carvings.  What they said, I have no idea.  I just recognized them from my recent ancient history courses.  Mike verified it from his knowledge learned during his ancient history and religion courses.

“Shit,” Mike started, “that's real Sumerian cuneiform.  They're not just fucking around.”

With that, the three of us looked at each other, all silently nodding in agreement as to what we needed to see next.  We turned back towards the portal, and sure enough, another piece of black fabric was hanging from it.

Steve was frozen in horror while looking – it was written all over his face that he feared the worst for Sara.

Mike limped in and removed the piece of fabric, fumbling with it for a moment, and holding it up for us to see what it was.  It was a pair of boxer-briefs.

“There's no crotch opening,” Mike started, “these are women's panties.”

Silence.  I looked around, first to Mike and then to Steve.  Steve's face contorted into a look of fear and anger, and he seemed if both emotions were fighting a war to see which would be expressed.  I briefly looked back to Mike, who was also staring at Steve.  I could tell he also saw the unstable look on Steve's face.

Steve lowered his head, his eyes staring at the underwear through the tops of his eyelids, face bowed.  He looked insane at that moment.  Slowly, he started to speak: “We will find Sara.  These bastards have stripped her naked and plan to mutilate her.  We.  Will.  Find.  Sara.”  He spoke the last four words very slowly, and very coldly.

Everything was silent.  Even the rain had tapered off into a light drizzle.  It was still dark in the forest, though.  The clouds had not yet broken.  The silence, even barely broken from the drips falling from the trees and the light drizzle still occasionally making its way to the forest floor, was deafening.

Steve glared off beyond the portal with grim determination.  Mike and I silently stared at Steve, trying to figure out how to best proceed in communication with him.  He was obviously at the snapping point, and we didn't want to push him any further.

The quiet contemplation of how to best handle Steve was answered – but not by us.

The shrill voice appeared again.  “You're almost here.  Why don't you finish your journey?  Sara's here.  She wants you to find her.  Unfortunately, you'll be too late.  I know that.  Ereshkigal knows that.  Blood will spill.”

This time, the voice came from one absolute direction.  The three of us looked in that direction just as, about a thousand feet away and a hundred feet lower, two bright fires lit up.  Through the trees, we could see several figures.  We assumed one was Sara, one was Chris, and one was Tim.

Without thinking, we started towards the flames.

The flames seemed to quickly die down as if the wood was too wet or not soaked in enough flammable liquids – large bonfires don't start quickly, particularly with wet wood – I knew that.  They flared up again in an alternating pattern.

We continued.  The path was not easy, but we continued.  Even Mike had seemed to have found a way to ignore the pain he was in.

We could hear quiet whimpers of pain – from a female voice – from near the fires. That must have been Sara.

Our pace quickened.  We descended the side of the steep slope quickly, all three of us making our way down using our hands to stabilize us.  Mud be damned.  We were close to rescuing Sara!

“You fumble through the woods like a falling rock,” the shrill voice came again. “We're waiting for you.”  It was definitely coming from where the fires were.

“I know you're waiting for us, Chris,” I shouted, “Look up, look down, and all. Yes, we saw.”

“No matter.  I've won.  Ereshkigal will have her prize,” came Chris's voice.  ""You just need to witness it.""

“Oh we will... and we'll stop you,” Steve shouted back.

Booming from all around us, “Good luck.”  It was the unnaturally low voice again. With a sarcastic tone.

Steve, Mike and I finally found the bottom of the climb and rushed towards the twin fires.  A few moments later, we were standing between the fires, feeling their heat on either side of us.  A figure rushed around behind us, still feeding the fires. As they flared, they heat became more intense.

Both fires flared once, and then started to die down again.  Before us, we saw Sara, completely naked.  Chris was sitting in a natural formation of rock that vaguely formed a throne, and Tim rushed in from the side that the last fire flared at.

Steve, Mike, and I were standing side by side, staring at Chris.

Briefly, I looked towards Steve, knowing how he felt, knowing that he didn't want to lose Sara.

As I saw Steve look at Sara, I glanced towards Sara looking back towards Steve.  I heard a loud snap to my left.  I looked back just in time to see Steve and Mike snatched up by their feet and becoming suspended in the trees.  A fucking rope trap.  Fuck.

Steve and Mike screamed as they were being lifted up, but quickly realized that there wasn't much they could do at that point.

I looked directly at Chris, sitting in his “throne”.  Draped over the back was a thick chain.  Right next to his hands on either side were two meat hooks, both already bloodied.

I looked again at Sara, and she seemed unharmed.  Where did the blood on the meat hooks come from?  One of the other victims perhaps?

“Chris, you will not succeed.” I proclaimed.

Tim rushed in front of my face.  “Yes, he will.”  He brandished a large knife and placed it against my throat.  With his free hand, he removed my Leatherman from it's home on my belt.  “He will succeed.  I promise you that.”

61,Realisations,1301365634,"The first thing I became aware of was a resonating within my body. A steady vibration coming in bursts every 3 seconds. As my hearing began tuning in I realised that the vibrations came in time with a loud banging that shook the the floor and rattled glass. 

I became aware of the cold below me, the floor was smooth, I realised I was lying on laminate flooring. Something about this seemed foreign to me.

Thinking about it, a lot of things escaped me at that moment. I couldn't remember where I was, how I'd gotten there, what day it was, hell, I couldn't even remember who I was.

And still the thuds droned on... thud... thud... thud...

Still lying on the cold laminate flooring my eyes refused to open, nevertheless I began noticing other things about my surroundings. There was a distinct smell, something metallic, I recognised it but couldn't place why. It was mixing with some other smell, something burning, not like a fire, no, not burning, somewhere in the back of my mind it reminded me of the fourth of July.  

Thud.. thud... thud...

I started to become more aware of my own body, I noticed I was lying on my front, odd. I also noticed a dull pain throbbing in my head and  the more I thought about it the more intense it became until with every thud my head felt like it was being torn open by a crowbar.

I began wondering how I'd gotten into this situation, and what exactly the situation was that I was in. God I wished that thudding would just stop so I could at least try to think straight. 

I tried to open my eyes to get a look at where I was, maybe seeing things would make them clearer. I tried desperately to open them but it was like a Chinese finger trap, the more I tried the more they stayed closed together. 

I took a deep breath, the pain from my head and the effort of trying to open my eyes had begun to make me feel sick and close to passing out again. I knew I couldn't let that happen. I was beginning to realise that whatever situation I was in, it wasn't a good one. 

In the second that I took to take a breath I noticed that the thudding had stopped it's ever repetitive pattern. I was reveling in this fact when suddenly a crash, so much louder than before made me jump. The shock had scared me into opening my eyes. What I saw before me made me wish I'd kept them shut. 

I could see a man lying a few feet away from me, his face only in profile as it stared at the ceiling. Something about him looked oddly familiar to me. Even with my non-existent memory and from my less than perfect vantage point I could tell that I knew this man. Forgetting the pain I was in for a second I raised myself up onto my elbows. 

""Harry""

The word fell from my mouth before I even knew I'd spoken it. Harry, my big brother lay there, looking like he'd chosen to randomly have a nap on the floor in the middle of the day only it wasn't so peaceful. From his mouth was a trickle of dried blood, his hands held the wound in his stomach from which his life had escaped. 

I didn't realise I'd gotten to my feet until I noticed I was looking down at him. Something wet formed just under his eye, for a second I thought it was his tears before I worked out it was mine. 

I turned away, unable to look at him any more. What faced me took my breath away. 

""Bloodbath"". I've read a lot of newspaper articles about crime scenes and that word is thrown around all the time, to me it always conjured up images of Elizabeth Báthory, the Blood Countess. I'd never really known what they meant by it until now. As I took in the sight of my brother's family laying in front of me. Dear Susan, my sister-in-law huddled in the corner of their living room her beautiful face now pale and empty, her long blonde hair matted with blood. In her arms their 3 year old, Jason, once such a bouncy toddler, flashes of teaching him how to kick a ball at the last family barbecue now tarnished as I stared at his lifeless little body. He seemed so small now. Donna, their middle child, 6 years old, a proper little woman, now she'd never get a chance to go to her senior prom or grow up and become the heart breaker she'd been destined to be. Only one missing. Daryl, their eldest. I scanned the room but couldn't see him. I noticed footprints in the blood. My eyes followed them to the door...

3 policemen stood in the doorway, Kevlar vests on, guns in hand. I startled as I realised they were all trained on me. 

""Face down on the ground!"" 

I stood dumbstruck, not taking in what they were asking of me. I went to protest when something caught my eye...

A gun, lying on the floor, inches from where I'd been lying only 10 seconds before. ",nosleep,dum-di-dum,/r/nosleep/comments/gdm72/realisations/
62,Ruminations in the Zombie Apocalypse,1301362981,"Today was the day it was going to end.  Light seeped through the slits in the upstairs bedroom blinds, the only windowed area that I didn't board up after the outbreak.  The room existed in a haze of perfume and the slight stench of rot that grew stronger as I neared the bed.  I sat on the edge, the mattress sagging from the weight of a second person.  My hands covered my face as if to shield me from the truth, to blind me from the room I had made my home for the last few weeks.

When I rose from the bed, I made my way towards the bathroom with a quickened stride.  The mirror reflected a face that looked more haggard than I can ever remember it being.  Stubble had set in on my cheeks, my lips were dried and cracked, dark circles had set in under my eyes, and I was looking more like one of them than a human as each day passed.  The only thing about me that looked remotely clean or sterile was the suit I wore, specifically for this occasion.  Why I decided to put it on, it was hard to say.  Maybe it seemed more respectful, or maybe I needed some comfort in a sense of normalcy.

Behind me I could hear the bedpost creaking, the sheets shifting with movement that never seemed to cease.  Even now, it was difficult to turn around and look at her.  It felt forced as I turned my head, a grinding sound flowing through my neck as I did so.  Dark brown hair covered most of her face, moans came through the the gag made of socks and wrapped around her head with nylons.  The bedpost banged against the wall in what was becoming a rapid pulling motion, the belt and tape that bound her hands to the post stayed strong.  I stood in the doorway and watched her struggle, her hair moving long enough for me to catch a glimpse of her eyes with pupils so large that the blue color they had once held was unseen.  Part of me wanted to weep, to fall to the floor and pound my fist against the hardwood until it was a bloody mess of bones and flesh.  Another part of me wanted to free her from her constraints and allow whatever would happen to happen.  Of course, I just stood there with my shoulder resting against the door frame and thought about the reality of what was to come.

""Do you remember the time we were making out in your aunt's garage and she almost beat me over the head with the snow shovel?"" I asked as I took my seat on the edge of the bed.  "" What about the time we made love on the pier in Santa Cruz and were almost caught by the police?  Remember when you drove your car into the neighbor's garage last year?  Maybe the time we went on vacation in Costa Rica and you had to baby me after I drank twelve shots of tequila at the pool bar?""

No response.  Of course she didn't remember, not now anyway.  Maybe I wanted to remember, saying it out loud fortified that we had a life before this.  Before she was bit in the arm by some wild eyed man in the grocery store parking lot.  Before she came home bleeding while chaos erupted outside.  Before I knew what she would become, a blood thirsty monster out of some terrible daydream.  Before I tied her up to protect myself and pray for a cure.  Before her skin sunk in and her flesh began to rot.  Before this godforsaken room.

The shotgun in the closet was leaning against the wall behind our coats.  A thin layer of dust covered one side, the shells stood stoically in their box having been untouched since their purchase.  Her father and I were going to go on a hunting trip in the spring, we were all going to do a lot of things.  The shells slide in easy as I load, the pump and the sound that comes with it seemed to echo off the of walls in a powerful reverberation.  I set it in on the side of the bed where I once slept next to her.

Lifting her is difficult as she writhes in my arms and I try not to breath through my nose.  I place a large blue tarp on the bed that reaches to the floor and the back wall.  It is an act of some final form of consideration, the hope that if anyone ever finds the scene of the gruesome aftermath it will be at the very least easier to clean.  After this, I take my position by her side.  My hand brushes through her hair, a clump of which sticks to my palm when I remove it from her head.

"" I want you to know I waited as long as I could,"" I tell her even though the words fall of deaf ears.  "" There isn't anything else I can do.  I want you to know that I tried.  There isn't anything else in this world I love more than you.  Even here and now, there isn't any place that I would rather be.  I am doing this because I love you.  I love you alive and smiling, I love you dead and rotting.  I think I always have, even before I knew you.""

With those final words, I lift part of the tarp and place the barrel of the shotgun against her head.  She moves sporadically, her temple tapping against the tip of the gun in a rhythmic motion.  When I pull the trigger the sound is deafening.  I use my free hand to check my ears for blood but my fingertips come back dry.  I cover her with some extra tarp after I remove her shackles, and then I lay back down on the bed.

For a moment I think about taking that gun and going outside.  I could chance the world, maybe even get to safety somewhere else.  I hadn't even looked outside in weeks, for all I knew it had gone back to some sort of normal.  Something falls against my hand from beneath the tarp, my eyes diverted from the light crossing the stucco ceiling.  It's her hand resting on top of mine.  I laugh, caught off guard by some sort of inexplicable irony that exists in this situation.  Even dead, for good this time, she can't let me go.  Then I weep, no longer needing to be strong for anyone or anything.

This small room was my world now, outside was some foreign land where I didn't belong.  If she was not with me, nothing mattered.  I gripped her hand, the soft touch it once held was replaced by dry and hard skin.  I lifted the shotgun from the side of the bed and let it rest on my chest.  The barrel pointed at my face as my head was elevated by a stack of pillow.  Inside of it I could only see an endless darkness, not unlike here eyes had been only minutes before.  I thought of better times.  Endless nights under the moonlight, the bravado of crashing waves against the shore, candlelit bathrooms with her waiting in the tub, the weight her her head on my shoulder as we sat on the couch, the light kisses on my neck when no one was looking, all of those beautiful and wondrous things.  

I tighten my grip on her hand as the other hand shakes on its way towards the trigger.  I take comfort that in death I could still remember the life we had together.  This was something that was not afforded to her, and something I was able to take advantage of.  I could feel the cold steel pressing against my thumb, I inhale slowly in anticipation.

63,Ruminations in the Zombie Apocalypse,1301361861,"Today was the day it was going to end.  Light seeped through the slits in the upstairs bedroom blinds, the only windowed area that I didn't board up after the outbreak.  The room existed in a haze of perfume and the slight stench of rot that grew stronger as I neared the bed.  I sat on the edge, the mattress sagging from the weight of a second person.  My hands covered my face as if to shield me from the truth, to blind me from the room I had made my home for the last few weeks.

When I rose from the bed, I made my way towards the bathroom with a quickened stride.  The mirror reflected a face that looked more haggard than I can ever remember it being.  Stubble had set in on my cheeks, my lips were dried and cracked, dark circles had set in under my eyes, and I was looking more like one of them than a human as each day passed.  The only thing about me that looked remotely clean or sterile was the suit I wore, specifically for this occasion.  Why I decided to put it on, it was hard to say.  Maybe it seemed more respectful, or maybe I needed some comfort in a sense of normalcy.

Behind me I could hear the bedpost creaking, the sheets shifting with movement that never seemed to cease.  Even now, it was difficult to turn around and look at her.  It felt forced as I turned my head, a grinding sound flowing through my neck as I did so.  Dark brown hair covered most of her face, moans came through the the gag made of socks and wrapped around her head with nylons.  The bedpost banged against the wall in what was becoming a rapid pulling motion, the belt and tape that bound her hands to the post stayed strong.  I stood in the doorway and watched her struggle, her hair moving long enough for me to catch a glimpse of her eyes with pupils so large that the blue color they had once held was unseen.  Part of me wanted to weep, to fall to the floor and pound my fist against the hardwood until it was a bloody mess of bones and flesh.  Another part of me wanted to free her from her constraints and allow whatever would happen to happen.  Of course, I just stood there with my shoulder resting against the door frame and thought about the reality of what was to come.

""Do you remember the time we were making out in your aunt's garage and she almost beat me over the head with the snow shovel?"" I asked as I took my seat on the edge of the bed.  "" What about the time we made love on the pier in Santa Cruz and were almost caught by the police?  Remember when you drove your car into the neighbor's garage last year?  Maybe the time we went on vacation in Costa Rica and you had to baby me after I drank twelve shots of tequila at the pool bar?""

No response.  Of course she didn't remember, not now anyway.  Maybe I wanted to remember, saying it out loud fortified that we had a life before this.  Before she was bit in the arm by some wild eyed man in the grocery store parking lot.  Before she came home bleeding while chaos erupted outside.  Before I knew what she would become, a blood thirsty monster out of some terrible daydream.  Before I tied her up to protect myself and pray for a cure.  Before her skin sunk in and her flesh began to rot.  Before this godforsaken room.

The shotgun in the closet was leaning against the wall behind our coats.  A thin layer of dust covered one side, the shells stood stoically in their box having been untouched since their purchase.  Her father and I were going to go on a hunting trip in the spring, we were all going to do a lot of things.  The shells slide in easy as I load, the pump and the sound that comes with it seemed to echo off the of walls in a powerful reverberation.  I set it in on the side of the bed where I once slept next to her.

Lifting her is difficult as she writhes in my arms and I try not to breath through my nose.  I place a large blue tarp on the bed that reaches to the floor and the back wall.  It is an act of some final form of consideration, the hope that if anyone ever finds the scene of the gruesome aftermath it will be at the very least easier to clean.  After this, I take my position by her side.  My hand brushes through her hair, a clump of which sticks to my palm when I remove it from her head.

"" I want you to know I waited as long as I could,"" I tell her even though the words fall of deaf ears.  "" There isn't anything else I can do.  I want you to know that I tried.  There isn't anything else in this world I love more than you.  Even here and now, there isn't any place that I would rather be.  I am doing this because I love you.  I love you alive and smiling, I love you dead and rotting.  I think I always have, even before I knew you.""

With those final words, I lift part of the tarp and place the barrel of the shotgun against her head.  She moves sporadically, her temple tapping against the tip of the gun in a rhythmic motion.  When I pull the trigger the sound is deafening.  I use my free hand to check my ears for blood but my fingertips come back dry.  I cover her with some extra tarp after I remove her shackles, and then I lay back down on the bed.

For a moment I think about taking that gun and going outside.  I could chance the world, maybe even get to safety somewhere else.  I hadn't even looked outside in weeks, for all I knew it had gone back to some sort of normal.  Something falls against my hand from beneath the tarp, my eyes diverted from the light crossing the stucco ceiling.  It's her hand resting on top of mine.  I laugh, caught off guard by some sort of inexplicable irony that exists in this situation.  Even dead, for good this time, she can't let me go.  Then I weep, no longer needing to be strong for anyone or anything.

This small room was my world now, outside was some foreign land where I didn't belong.  If she was not with me, nothing mattered.  I gripped her hand, the soft touch it once held was replaced by dry and hard skin.  I lifted the shotgun from the side of the bed and let it rest on my chest.  The barrel pointed at my face as my head was elevated by a stack of pillow.  Inside of it I could only see an endless darkness, not unlike here eyes had been only minutes before.  I thought of better times.  Endless nights under the moonlight, the bravado of crashing waves against the shore, candlelit bathrooms with her waiting in the tub, the weight her her head on my shoulder as we sat on the couch, the light kisses on my neck when no one was looking, all of those beautiful and wondrous things.  

I tighten my grip on her hand as the other hand shakes on its way towards the trigger.  I take comfort that in death I could still remember the life we had together.  This was something that was not afforded to her, and something I was able to take advantage of.  I could feel the cold steel pressing against my thumb, I inhale slowly in anticipation.  There would be no one around to hear the shot, no one would know what our final moments had been like.  With a boarded up home, I had lived my final days in a room above.

I've seen them pass me as I pretend to sleep. I can't sleep anymore.

They are always there. Even in daylight, the shadows are consuming me, and their whispers are haunting. Why are they talking to me?

They don't only watch me, they do horrible things... unspeakable things.

I've should of noticed something was wrong when it started. A month ago my cat disappeared.

Ever since i've heard tapping in the walls and meowing. Only in my room. I've even felt something purring on my bed. 

And last night... A loud yowl woke me up. Am I going crazy? Is the cat stuck in my walls.

The whispers always come at night.

Some are daunting, others are comforting. Every night an old woman tells me to not be afraid. She always says it will be over soon.

I wish she would go away.

67,My Camping Trip,1301350709,"After I graduated high school but before attending college, I decided some solitude in the mountains would be a good thing. I live in a big city so getting away from it all sounded very appealing before continuing my education. I am an avid writer, photographer, and I enjoy music. I am fairly outdoorsy but needed to do a little bit of research to make sure I would have the safest, best trip as possible. I ended up choosing to go into glacier national park in western Montana. My parents were hesitant as it literally is the middle of nowhere and is notorious environment for bears.

Well, I fly into Missoula, Montana and make arrangements to be driven to a trailhead within GNP. I stayed there for 9 days and had an absolute blast. Armed with a map and a compass, I did a lot of hiking. One day I made it eleven miles and 2300 vertical feet. Needless to say, I was exhausted that night. Not having a schedule to adhere to was exhilarating. My first love is photography, and I hiked around mostly to set up great photos that I could see in my mind. This was about 10 years ago and DSLR's were either unavailable or extremely expensive, so I was using an older 35mm that I had gotten for my 16th birthday.

I was able to capture some pretty epic vistas, from snow covered mountain tops, to gurgling creeks and fields of wildflowers that covered immense expanses of land. I saw a bear way on the otherside of the lake one afternoon, along with a bunch of other wildlife. 

The entire trip was pretty much exactly how I planned it, with only one little bit of creepiness. I saw exactly one other person the whole time I was there. I saw Him in profile, sitting on a boulder as I was rounding a bit of a trail that led to the top of the ridge. He was a rough looking mountain man kind of guy. Thick bushy beard, old, worn boots that had seen a lot of miles, and a grimy parka that was open at the chest.  I noticed he had a large revolver hanging off on of his hips, and a giant machete type blade on the other.

He was about 40 feet away from me when I first saw him. His back was to me, though I'm sure he heard me. The sweet smell of pipe tobacco wafted in the air around me. Almost on cue, as I recognized the cloying scent of tobacco, He took a drag off his pipe and lazily exhaled the smoke in the air above him. It was a still, summer day, and the smoke hung around his head. It was a surreal type of scene and I brought my camera up as I had an image framed perfectly in my head: The man, surrounded in smoke, with a sweeping vista of Mount MacDonald in the far background. As soon as the shutter clicked, he whipped around and screamed at me:

'WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING SON?!?'

I stuttered some apologies to him, but he was gazing at me with contempt and disgust. I walked a couple steps closer to him in an attempt to reconcile and explain myself. 'I wouldn't come any closer to me if I were you, boy.' he half snarled, half grunted. It was painfully cognizant to me how I must appear. Shiny new hiking boots, a high tech hiking backpack that I had rented from REI, nalgene bottle carabinered to my pack. This guy didn't have any gear whatsoever, and he looked comfortable in the outdoors.

I was scared absolutely shitless, not knowing what to do. I said my apologies again and quickly high tailed it back from whence I came. I was almost jogging down the trail I was so scared. After I get down the trail, I just felt... weird, like I was being followed or watched. I thought this was impossible as most of the trail was covered in brush and thick pine trees.  Turns out I was half right. I crouched down near the edge of the treeline and I brought my binoculars up to my eyes to peer up to the rocky outcrop I had just hiked to and ran away from. I was met by His piercing gaze through the binoculars. There was absolutely no way he could have seen me from up there, but regardless, he was looking right at me, with an evil smile on his face. He turns away and I swear I hear demoniac laughter carried in the wind.

Guys, I was irrationally convinced I was going to die. I thought I had pissed this guy off and he was going to exact his own brand of mountain justice on me. I hiked a LONG time, and didn't stop to make camp for the night until the sun was almost down. This was a bad idea. I was quite shaken by what I had encountered and the manner to which he reacted to me. I hastily made a fire, and I spooked myself several times, my eyes playing tricks on me with the shadows cast about due to the fire light. 

I ate, and crawled into my tent. I was on edge and my heart rate rose 20 BPM for every unexplained noise beyond the confines of my tent. I was tired so I eventually passed out. It was one my mind the next day but I eventually passed it off and continued about my trip. I took a lot more pictures and wrote in my journal and enjoyed my own company.

I get picked up at the trail heard and driven back to town. I enjoy the largest steak of my life, along with almost a gallon of beer. I catch my flight back home the next day. After I clean all my shit up, I drive to the store to get my film developed. I know I took some really killer pics on this trip, and I am excited to see what turned up.

I had all my film labeled by date, and I had kept track of what I was shooting in my journal, so I knew what to expect. I went through all my pictures, and a lot of them did turn out really, really well. I was pleased with myself.

The final roll of film that I was leafing through made the blood drain out of my face and I felt sick to my stomach. It was the roll from the day I had bumped into Him on the little rocky outcrop. Two pictures stood out to me in a bad way. The first picture because of what it didn't contain, and the second picture because of what it did contain.

I held the first picture in my hands. The amazing view of Mount MacDonald in the background, the boulders on top of the ridge, the haze of smoke sitting in the wind, but no man. The man I SAW and PHOTOGRAPHED and INTERACTED with simply was not in the picture. Like he had been shopped out or something weird.

I was very perplexed, and a chill ran down my spine. I shuffled through the other photos taken that day. Panoramas, lakes, wildlife, and then...

The last picture I was looking at was taken from the perspective of the entrance to my tent. It was picture of myself, passed out sleeping in my sleeping bag. ",nosleep,AhhhBROTHERS,/r/nosleep/comments/gdgsm/my_camping_trip/
68,Jesa,1301340994,"I've been hesitant to put my story up here mostly because I'm lazy and not a good writer, but also because I didn't think it would be good enough for no sleeps.  But, after reading that nosleep has lost some of its character over the months, I got the nerve to finally write this. Also, although what I'm about to say goes against the ethos of r/nosleep, I would feel disingenuous without saying it: this story is completely true--absolutely, positively, 100% true. My parents know a bit about it, my sister experienced the events with me, and I wrote the story to my cousin while he was in boot camp shortly after the incident. He asked to write him some interesting news to keep up his morale. I haven't bothered telling anyone else until now.  

I immigrated with my family to the United States in the late 70's. My dad's sister married a white guy in the U.S. military, and with her help, she sponsored my dad, their two brothers, and all of their wives and children.  We all lived near each other, grew up together, and the families all practiced their old cultural values: my dad and his brothers played traditional Korean board and card games; his sister and our moms would make Korean food; they all would seek out other Korean immigrants and families to maintain a community.  Pretty much the standard stuff most immigrants do once they arrive to a new country. One thing, however, that we did once a year that I doubt any other non-Korean immigrants did was honor the dead.

Koreans have a cultural ceremony called Jesa. You can read more about it here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesa

Basically, the ceremony is to honor and remember the deceased parent(s) of the oldest son, and all of his siblings, at his house. The event starts in the morning of the anniversary of the dead.  The women of the household begin the day by preparing and cooking dishes and food for the event. Towards the evening, they lay out the ceremonial gear (incense, silver ware, etc...), the food, and the pictures of the deceased on a table. The males of the household (including my white uncle, whom I used to tease for being forced to partake) would stand before the display, and bow several times onto the floor, and chant something--I forgot what we had to say since it has been almost two decades since I've last done this. So, my dad, his brothers, my uncle, and all of the boys (my cousins and I) would have to do this. My cousins and I would always make a big joke of the ritual. Whenever we prostrated ourselves at the final bow, we would start giggling, ""Hey, I see the food being eaten! It's MOVING! OH NOEESS!!!"" Then my dad would slap one of us on the head. Every year, we would get together to do this ceremony, and every year, my cousins and I would be giddy with morbid curiosity. However, this would not last.

Our tight knit family would grow apart over the years. My white uncle, my dad's sister, and my cousin moved to Japan for the military. My younger uncle and my cousin left to San Jose, CA after my aunt died of cancer at a very young age. My dad and the second oldest brother had a roiling family feud that would span a decade. Ultimately, they stopped talking to each other, and till this day haven't spoken to each other for over 17 years. In that time, our Jesa ceremonies slowly diminished until we put away the ceremonial garb for several years. That is until my white uncle and aunt moved back for good.

I was 4 years old when we first immigrated to the States. By the time my uncle and aunt moved back, I was 18 y.o. and in my final year of high school. I had not seen my cousin and his family for over 8 years. In that time, the feud that grew between my dad and his brother carried over to the entire family. It was a disgusting feud, the details of which would put most soap opera dramas to shame. My cousins from the opposing side of the family fed me all kinds of lies and terrible half-truths (for example, they told me that my cousin that left for Japan was supposedly adopted or stolen), trying to turn me against not only my returning aunt and uncle, but my own parents. So, when my uncle, aunt, and cousin finally arrived to our home town, I wasn't eager to see them. The anniversary of my grandparents' death was a week away, and my aunt wanted to get together with my dad and our family and hold Jesa--something which we haven't done together in 8 years. I still had not seen them yet, nor did I want to, and I really didn't want to do any of that bullshit ritual anyways; so, I made an excuse and dug out to my friend's place.

I hung out at my friend's place playing computer games on the good ole Commodore Amiga. I stayed as long as I could, until his mom finally kicked me out at 10 pm. I made the walk back in the dark. I remember noticing the full moon, and how brightly lit and beautifully eerie the walk back home was.

When I finally arrived, my parents were already in bed. My sister, who was 16 y.o., was sleeping as well. No signs of my relatives either. The ceremonial garb was still laid out, and so was some food and the pictures of my grandparents. By the way, my dad's parents died really young. He and the rest of his siblings grew up extremely poor and on their own in war torn South Korea.  Anyways, I looked at the time and it was a bit past 10:30 pm. I got some food, hit the books, and studied for awhile.

Back then, sleep was really important to me. I was always tired in school; so, it was important for me to get 8 hours of sleep every night. I remember looking at the clock and thinking, ""11:50 pm...cool, I have about 7 and a half hours of sleep tonight."" I went to the kitchen, washed some dishes, and turned off the lights to head towards the hallway to my room. Since then, I have figured it was near midnight when the following occurred.

As I was heading down the hallway in the dark, I heard light patter of rain and drizzle outside. The air felt a bit moist, and the winds began to whistle through the blinds. As I reached the bedroom doors, I heard a faint sound coming from the living room, ""ding, dong..."" Two notes, about a second apart, coming from the piano. My half step slowed to a stop, the hairs on my legs and arms began to bristle, and a sense of dread began to fill my stomach, ""What the..."" I slowly turned thinking, ""Did I just hear the piano???"" As I was thinking this, the piano responded, seemingly to confirm my thoughts, with the same two notes but louder and one octave lower, ""DING, DONG."" We've all heard people joking that they would kick ass and take names when it comes to something that might be supernatural. That they would just mosey on over to where-ever the supernatural event occurred and conduct a scientific investigation. I thought I would be one of these people. Boy was I wrong.

I literally froze up. I could not move a damn. My whole body tensed up, and every part of my skin was covered with goosebumps. I was faint from the tension and fear. I almost passed out. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, my ass kicked into gear and I jumped into my room, turned on the lights, ran into my sisters room, turned on her lights, started shaking her to wake her up, ""NANCY! NANCY! DID YOU HEAR THE PIANO PLAYING?!? IT WAS PLAYING BY ITSELF!"" She looked at me with wild fear and confusion in her eyes. Then the piano played again: same two notes, one octave lower. It did this several times. The blood drained from my sister's face as she understood what was going on. I got her up, and we gathered the courage to walk to the living room.

When we got there, the piano, an old upright, had the keyboard cover lowered. There was no way anything could directly push down on the keys. There was not enough space for a mouse or rat to get through to the keys. I hesitantly opened the keyboard cover to look. I was anticipating the keys to start playing by themselves again. My eyes glazed over staring at them, waiting for the macabre to appear. Nothing happened, and yet, I was not sure if IT was truly over. At this time, my mom came out of her room, squinting at us through newly awoken eyes, frowning for an answer, ""What you guys doing? So late!"" Then she walked over to the kitchen to get some water and put away some food. As my sister and I helped her, I glanced over at the table for the ceremonial garb. The pictures of my grandparents were...

..

.

gone. I was confused and the feelings of paranoia began to return.  I looked over at my mom and asked if she moved the pictures.  She perked up a bit, ""Wha? Picture no more over there?""  I frowned a bit, ""I could have sworn they were here just a few minutes ago.""  After some searching, my sister and I eventually found them on top of the piano with some of our other family portraits. We looked at each other and watched as our faces paled.

Till this day, my sister and I wonder about my memory: maybe it's foggy and I never saw our grandparents' pictures on the table. My mother swears she never touched the pictures after she got up that night. My dad doesn't remember a thing about moving the pictures or not, and being the staunch atheist/realist, he just thinks I'm talking out of my ass. Maybe. I've told myself that over the years to keep myself sane. Although, the one thing I still can't get over is the piano.  We've sold the upright a long time ago, but the notes still ring crystal clear in my mind's ear: D and G, the significance of which still puzzles me.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/gdcxx/jesa/
69,A figure in the garage..,1301330029,"Happened to me about 14 years ago, when I was about 9.  It was shortly after my dad had passed away, my brothers and I got all our toys from his house, and the were in a couple bins in the garage with all our toys we had already.

I had the last bin, and was walking into my basement with my dog in front of me, when staring into the garage, then he starts growling, but isn't looking at me, he's looking into the garage.  I slowly turn around and see a black ""cloaked"" like figure.  (Picture the Grim Reaper would best describe the look, but definitely isn't what I saw.)  I could tell it was looking away from us.

70,My garage and the Devil.,1301322641,"Okay, so this might not be really creepy (thought it was scary as hell to me and my friend) but it is definitely a true story.

This happened about 10 years ago and I still can't figure out what happened. Here we go:

I live in an apartment. We have this underground main garage, and in it, there are several sub-garages (let's call it that) for every tenant. Me and a buddy of mine were hanging out in my (sub)garage. It's a pretty a big one, you can park about 3 cars in it just to give you some reference. Anyway, my family has a lot of stuff down there from clothes to books, you name it. 

My dad has this big collection of books about the supernatural and the paranormal. One of those books was about the Devil and its various names and supposed spottings of it by people throughout the years. Me and my friend are reading this and I can tell that he's kinda getting spooked by it; he kept looking over his shoulder whenever there was a noise. 

So being the smartass I am, I tell him that this is all bullshit and to prove it, I'll call out for the Devil and order him to show himself. My friend has this really funny expression on his face like he's about to crap his pants but he doesn't stop me. I keep saying the different names I see on the book: ""Show yourself, Beelzebub! You pussy!"" Yeah, great idea, insulting the Devil. Anyway, I've been doing this for about a minute when I finally stop and turn to my friend, telling him that I was right and it was all crap. 

All of a sudden, the garage door begins to wobble. It lasts for about a second or two and stops. I immediately stop laughing. But then I figure:""Maybe it was the wind? No reason to worry.""

BAM! There's this really violent and loud knock on the door. So loud it made my ears ring. Okay, now I'm definitely scared. What in the hell was that? (Pun intended) I ask if anyone's there. No answer. I put the book down and by this point I'm kicking myself for doing what I did. A few seconds later, there's another knock on the door; not as loud but still kinda violent. We both jump. We're not even talking to eachother, just cursing underbreath and pacing around. I keep asking if anyone is there but, still, no answer. After a few minutes of waiting for something to happen, we decide we're through waiting so we're going to do something about it. We grab whatever we can to defend ourselves with and get closer to the door. We figured, next time someone knocks on the door, we open it and, you know... Jesus take the wheel.

So we wait... And we wait... And we wait some more. And then: Knock, knock, knock; Three light knocks on the door, as if someone was asking to come in or something. So I open the door immediately after the last knock and... There's no one outside. My friend and I run like the wind and leave the garage. We didn't even turn the light off or close the door, we just bolted.

To this day, I have no idea what happened. Could have been a neighbor, I guess, but then again... I did open the door right after those last 3 knocks and there was no one around. How is that possible? Still, to this day, I don't believe it was the Devil. But on the other hand... Who was it? I can't figure this shit out. Ten years later, and I can't make sense out of it. 

Btw, still creeped out when I have to go to the garage. Especially at night. ",nosleep,Coveiro,/r/nosleep/comments/gd5e5/my_garage_and_the_devil/
71,Childhood Memories - Part 2,1301312509,"I posted a few days ago about my childhood experiences of living in a haunted house.
(http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gb8ye/childhood_memories/)

When my parents began looking for houses, they searched high and wide and took the house out of desperation – growing family, my father had a new job, the kids need to go to school, etc.

As I noted before, it wasn’t till many years later that the family discussed the events.   My mother and father were very surprised by our encounters.  My mother said that she never wanted to tell us about the house’s history because they were concerned that we’d be too scared.

My mother told me a story about the real estate agent - Similar to the plot of that Simpson’s episode where Marge sells the murder house to Ned Flanders.  The agent told a pretty frightening experience while she was setting up for an open house that day.  She said that she was in the master bedroom, cleaning up and vacuuming when she felt a weird sensation behind her which made her turn around.  To her surprise, there was a man standing at the foot of the bed staring at her.  The man was tall, black hair, and very pale skin with a slight green hue.  He wore a black suit and tie.  He was completely expressionless.   The agent was startled, but said something along the lines of, “Oh!  I didn’t realize anyone was already here! “.  

The man just stood at the foot of the bed, staring at her without saying a word.  

The agent thought that maybe something was wrong, and began to approach him.  She moved closer a bit.  He then disappeared right in front of her.  (I’m not sure what happened after, but common sense would probably dictate to leave the house for a little while.)

I’m also not sure why the agent decided to share that story with my mother and father.  I think this chalks up to small town mentality where everyone is each other’s neighbour.  The events took place at a time when neighbourhood kids would leave the house, disappear for the entire day, and parents wouldn’t think anything of it. 

In one memory, my parents were away for the weekend so I was staying at a neighbour’s house.  I hated being at the neighbour’s house so I decided to be a brat and run.  I ended up at my home in the backyard.  I could hear my neighbour’s mother calling for me as I crept along the side of the house giggling and being stealthy.  On the side of the house there was a big glass window with white doley curtains.  For some reason I looked up and just stood there staring.  Someone came to the window from behind the curtains.  I couldn’t make out a face, but I could see a large dark shape and it felt like it was staring right back at me.  I ran the fuck out of there.  My memory is sketchy for the events afterwards, I don’t remember if I told anyone.  I do remember that I didn’t feel like eating or playing with toys that night.  All I could think about was my poor cat and that she must be scared.

My cat was just a kitten at the time, but she seemed to notice things weren’t quite right.  Many times she would be sleeping or resting, and suddenly would screech, go flying under the couch and start moaning.  She wouldn’t come out either.  We would have to devise a plan to cut her off from moving, and coax her out. 

My parents weren’t oblivious to what was going on.  They were actively looking for a new home.  Too many weird things were happening and they were afraid for the safety of me and my brothers.

I’m going to end this one short.  I was writing up a few other encounters, when I had a flashback to some events I completely forgot about - it's been a very long time since I've thought about any of this.  I hope everyone is enjoying!

74,Colorful spectral figures,1301292311,"This is 100% true, and happened to me when I was around the age of 7 at my aunt's house. This is one of the few childhood memories I can recall, much less vividly recall.

I was at my aunt's house spending the night because she was a convenient stop along the way across a few states to our vacation destination. I have to share a bed with my mother that night and went to bed around 11 p.m. I slept peacefully for a few hours until around 2 a.m. I woke up and looked around the room. The door was open, just as it had been left earlier, but there was an eerie light coming from the window, a very, very fine ray of bright white light, shining onto the light brown carpet. However, to my surprise, at the foot of the bed were three very long, skinny, spectral figures. They didn't have a human shape, they were more like streaks on the wall enlarged to scale, roughly 6 feet tall and a foot across. They moved across the room, paying no heed to the terrified child staring at them between eye rubbings. The light blue one had a long, black, hollow-looking face, the orange one had a rage-filled, scrunched face, and the green one wore a scowl of dissatisfaction. They moved around the room as a gang, keeping their distance from the bed. They crossed through the light beam, instantly changing to a golden yellow, then stepping out and returning to their original colors and seeming unfazed. Then, a few minutes later, they edged closer to my bed. My heart was racing and over the blood pumping and pounding in my ears I hard a low moan, a high wail, and a quiet, satisfied chuckle. They moved to my side of the bed, inches from me. I did not look them in the ""face"". I just stared below their mouth and remained silent. When they moved away I woke my mother up, pointed directly at them, and said, ""Mom, do you see those things?! Are they ghosts?!"" She said there was nothing there, I was having a bad dream (even though I was pointing right at a corner of the room). Then, when my mother looked away from the spot I had pointed, they disappeared. I did not sleep that night, I just stared at the closed, blinded window. A few hours later I decided to gather up enough courage to fetch myself a glass of water. I made it to the kitchen, scared sh*tless but unharmed and fixed myself a glass of water. However, when I tried to walk down the hallway back to the bedroom, I passed a wall with lots of old photos on it. Some of them were paper clipping of famous events with pictures of old family members and all of the sorts. Right as I passed that I got very, very dizzy and held the wall for balance, spilling a bit of my water. Then, through my daze, I heard a crack like that of a wood board snapping, a snap like that of a popping rubber band, and a crash like that of a vase and man falling to the ground. Startled and teary-eyed, I ran to my bedroom and asked my mom, who was only maybe 15 feet from where I embraced the wall,  if she had heard anything (she was awake because I had crawled out of bed to get the glass). She said she heard nothing at all and told me to get some sleep. I stayed up until 7 a.m., when the rest of my family woke up. I never got to finish my water.",nosleep,Orelegan,/r/nosleep/comments/gcy7h/colorful_spectral_figures/
75,The Man that Never Left.,1301290833,"I caught a glimpse of him.  I'll tell you that.

My friend T used to live around the corner from my block.  He lived about a block down from that corner, so it was about a two minute walk.  T had told me about the strange happenings that would occur from time to time in his house.

Sometimes he'd be in his room, sitting in his chair facing the computer with the wall behind it.  To the right of that wall was the door, facing T directly from that wall.  His house often got hot, so he liked to keep his door open to let the air currents circulate.

He'd be facing his screen and catch  glimpse of motion to his right.  On these occasions he'd turn to face the open door, with a clear line of visibility.  A man would be striding past, as casual as ever. Whenever T would get up to see who was in his house, there'd be nobody there.

He would tell me of these occasions, of his keys loudly crashing on the ground next to him, when he placed them right in the middle of his desk hours before.  Sounds that would wake him up, jolting from his bed in reaction to the loud sounds.

He would tell me of incessant footsteps that would plague his house at night.  Of his birds screaming out in terror in the middle of some of these nights when the footsteps would be near them.

I had been in his house twice before but never experienced anything of the nature.  Still, I was intrigued, as his tone was always honest, the look on his face one of a sort of desperation, of being genuinely bothered by these experiences.

One night I walked to meet up with him.  He had just gotten home, so he was going to change into more comfortable clothes before heading out and took a bit longer than he had stated, so I was waiting outside of his house for some minutes.

My attention diverted through the window on the front porch, where a stretch of the staircase can be seen through the window, with the bottom of the stairs disappearing against the wall next to the door, so the landing of the stairs was out of view, but the hallway still was.

I felt someone coming down, and as I looked through the window I saw a man quickly make his way down the stairs, and disappear into the blindspot of the window.  The only way that could have happened was if the man was just crouching in the corner on the bottom, because if he did anything but that, he'd be out of view.

I didn't see him come out.  For a moment I thought he was maybe hiding to try to scare T when he made his way down the stairs.  I couldn't think of any other reason a man would do that.  Had he tripped?  Maybe he got hurt and fell into the ground in front of the steps where I couldn't see him.

I knew T would be coming out shortly, so I awaited to see what his reaction was.  He strolled down the stairs in a quick but casual manner, went through the blindspot and appeared in front of the door.  

I looked through the glass carefully to notice his facial expressions.  He had a slight grin and his eyes fixated on mine as he opened the door.

""What's up, man?"" he asked me.

""Nothing...did you see anybody on your way down the stairs just now?"" I inquired.

""What do you mean?  If anybody's home right now?"" he asked in a confused tone.

I explained to him how I had seen a man come down the stairs and disappear at the bottom of the flight of stairs, and that I stayed looking until I could see T come to confirm that anybody who could have been there would not have escaped.

He smiled with a grimmace and that look that says ""See I told you so"" and proclaimed, ""I see you've met my friend.""",nosleep,M3nt0R,/r/nosleep/comments/gcxsb/the_man_that_never_left/
76,"Stitching itself in my head, this nightmare leaves me to cry myself to sleep again.",1301289542,"What you're about to read, is a recurring nightmare that is caused when certain events do not happen. Which is very often. Both my girlfriend, and I have experienced something involving this little girl, and she's definitely not a ghost, because she's left scratches on both of us that burn then slowly fade to nothing more than a mark like a hand print on a sunburn. 


I'm sitting in my house, it's about 8:00 p.m. and a light rain fall is tapping away at my bedroom window... I'm sitting on my bed, with Victoria. We're up against a wall, I'm sitting up, playing Gears of War, and she's laying down, her head in my lap while she browses the internet on my laptop. The lights flicker, and it barely phases us. They flicker again as a bolt of lightning illuminates the stormy sky outside. From the corner of my right eye, I see a shadow illuminated against my wall for that split second of light filling itself into my room. Victoria doesn't move, so I assume it was nothing. Soon the whole room fills with a silence that isn't quite roaring, thanks to the rain outside... My gaming console stops humming and I don't hear anything... I freak out a little, I nudge Victoria's shoulder and the laptop falls from it's perch on her lap. Her head lolls to the side and I'm choked with fear, depression, anger, and so much more all deciding to gang up on me and shove itself into my lungs. She's dead... She's dead... For some reason, I can't cry. I won't let myself cry, as if I know I can fix this... Her throat's slit, and the blood is streaking down her neck, reflecting the dull light of my TV. My heart is racing and I look into those dead eyes once again... The life behind those gorgeous blue eyes is gone... And the smell of death is slowly reaching my lungs. A sharp tune is being played from my keyboard downstairs. I get more worried, due to the fact that my keyboard hasn't been connected to any power for a while now... Then the singing starts. It's a soft melodious voice... But then it turns into a creepy little girl's lullaby. The song's now on loop and the singing moves around downstairs. It's going towards the stairs... The sound of something heavy hits the stairs and a little girl giggles. I choke again... Then the footsteps start. The scariest thing about this, is the unnerving singing. The heavier the footsteps, the louder the singing. My ears start to ring, and eventually I become aware that the la la la is right outside my door. Lightning strikes again and I see the little girl. Doll in hand, her tattered dress, long brown hair, demonically green eyes, and rotting flesh frighten me. My heart's thumping hard and the girl starts to scream. I awaken to realize that the screaming... is my own... And that I was only asleep. At school. Cuddling with Victoria on the couch in the theatre room, she's brushing my hair back, I'm drenched in sweat, and she's kissing my forehead. ""It's okay honey, she can't get you here...."" are the last words I hear before I actually wake up.

Shortly after finding Jill's body, eviscerated - for the second time, the story continues...

***


“We have to continue on.  We need to find Sara.  As soon as we can contact the authorities, we'll try and lead them back here.”  Steve's resolve was strong.

“We really should cut down Jill...” I started.

“NO!” Steve yelled back at me.  “We need to find Sara.  If we cut down Jill, we'll just find her again, even more mutilated.  I don't want that.”

“Steve may... he may be right,” Mike muttered, just barely audible under the sound of the storm.  “We've found both Joe and Jill twice – the second time, more mutilated than the first.  Think about it.”

I closed my eyes for a moment, trying to get my mind around the situation.  I breathed deeply and let out a sigh.  “I... I suppose you're right.  Let's go.”  I really felt bad about leaving Jill's horribly mutilated corpse behind, but I also understood that if there was any chance to save Sara from the same fate, we needed to take it.

The rain started coming down harder, the dull roar becoming a loud thunder.  The wind, lightning and thunder intensified.  We were all soaked to the bone, but determined. Habitually, I checked my watch, 4:48pm – still a good three hours before dusk, but because of the thick black thunderstorm clouds and the dense forest, light levels were very low.  I couldn't see more than 100 feet in any direction.  The only lights we had were the mini-maglites that Mike and I carried (the 2 AA battery models).  Neither of us had started to use them yet, though I felt like I might need to soon.  While constantly on, the batteries would only last a few hours.  We needed to conserve them, as we didn't know how long we would still be out there.

Initially, the descent down the far side of the mountain started somewhat easier than the ascent had been.  The slope was shallower and not quite as rocky.  It was still very slippery due to the wet leaves, and becoming increasingly muddy.  The rain had continued on long enough that there were small streams of water flowing down the side of the mountain towards the valley below.

Steve, still in the lead, must have hit a muddy patch, because he suddenly slid down the side of the mountain and just barely out of sight.  Mike and I increased our pace, yet still tried to be a little safe about the climb.  A broken leg out here would have meant certain death, even without Chris and Tim running around.  As Mike and I scurried down the side of the mountain on all fours, sliding safely when we could, and using our hands to stabilize us when sliding wasn't safe, we heard Steve scream from just up ahead.

“WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?” Steve screamed?

“Steve, we're coming!  Hold tight!” Mike yelled back.

“HOLY FUCKING HELL IN A HANDBASKET!” Steve yelled again as Mike and I neared his position.

“We're almost there, Steve!” I shouted back.  Steve's screams had become unintelligible and truly terrified.

Another flash of lightning and another clap of thunder – another rustling nearby as another tree branch fell to the forest floor.

Mike and I finally had slid/crawled to Steve's location.  “What was it?  What did you see?” Mike asked frantically.

“There!” Steve pointed to something ahead of us.

Mike and I both looked immediately towards where Steve was pointing.  Just barely on the edge of sight was a figure in white robes blowing in the wind.  Its right hand seemed to move in such a way as to beckon us closer.

Mike pulled his lock-blade from the belt holster it was in and snapped it open.  At the same time, I pulled out my Leatherman and locked the pointed straight blade into place.

“Steve, stay behind us.  We're going to check it out,” I said quietly.

Mike and I approached slowly.  The hand of the figure seemed to be all that moved besides the white robes that billowed in the wind.  As we closed in, the laughter started again.  This time, it seemed to come from the figure – or directly behind it.

When Mike and I got to within about 30 feet of the figure, it became evident that it was nothing more than a white robe strung up on some fallen branches.  A set of wet twigs had been fashioned into a head-like shape at the top.  Immediately behind it, we found one of the all-weather, battery operated speakers we had brought along on the shoot, connected to a weather-proof RF receiver.  The laughter continued to spew forth from the speaker.

“This is one of the speakers we brought along,” I stated to Mike.  “Remember that we planned on doing the same gag on the shoot?”

Mike nodded.  “Chris, Tim, whoever is out there, we're on to you!” Mike shouted into the wilderness.  “The cheap gags no longer work.  Shit, we fucking planned them!”

The laughter coming from the speaker ended, and then, after a moment of silence, a voice came from the speaker.  This one was low and gravelly, completely unlike anything we had heard before.  It sounded like a voice that had been through a pitch shifter.  It sounded like one of those unnaturally deep voices that you often hear in horror films.

“You screamed.  Ereshkigal loves screams.” The voice started.  “I love screams. Keep coming.  You're not done yet.  You do still want to find Sara alive, don't you?”

The speaker fell silent, only a quiet static coming from it.  I turned it off and removed the large 12v motorcycle battery from the back of it.  (As a side note, these speakers were something I had hacked together, adding the ability to operate for short periods on a 12 volt motorcycle battery, and I had modified the cable port on the back to utilize a AA powered radio transmitter/reciever.  The weatherproofing was important, as we obviously planned to use them outside.)

Not caring about any sort of financial loss anymore (a life was on the line after all), I dropped the speaker and the battery to the forest floor.  “Let's keep going,” I stated.

“Which way, though?” Mike asked. “I don't see any signs of where Sara went or where whoever put that speaker and robe there went.”

Steve and I started searching around.  Steve had calmed down after realizing that the figure was nothing as scary as it appeared.

After a few minutes of searching, I found a few broken shrubs and some moss on the base of a tree that had been pushed to a lump at ground level.  “I think we need to go this way,” I said, mentioning the broken stems and moss.

“Are you sure?” Steve asked.

“Steve, I'm no master tracker, but this is pretty fucking obvious.  Look.”  I pointed him towards what I had seen.  After a brief look, he agreed with me.

We headed off towards where the disturbed undergrowth and moss had been.  The raging storm overhead had covered most any tracks we might have followed.  The ground was terribly muddy.  We seemed to slog through the mud forever.

Suddenly, Mike took another fall, screaming in pain.  Steve and I rushed to him. “Mike, are you okay?  Your leg looked pretty bad earlier.” I questioned.

“Well, it's definitely not broken – I wouldn't have gotten this far if it was.” Mike started.  “It's definitely injured.  Why didn't you tell me about the blood?”

“I never saw it,” I lied.

“Well, the fucking cuts and scrapes are killing me.  I think I need to tie it up.”

Steve had his shirt off nearly before Mike had finished his statement.  “Jon, give me your Leatherman.  I need to cut his pants leg open.” (He referred to me, as I'm sure you, as the reader, will forget my [changed] name, Jon, as I rarely use it in this story.)

I handed over my Leatherman, still open, and Steve performed a brilliant bit of first aid.  Moments later, Mike's leg was patched up with bandages crudely fashioned from Steve's shirt and a few small twigs to hold it together, and he felt ready to get back on his feet.

Steve handed my Leatherman back to me and said, “Don't you know basic first aid? Fuck, come on.”

Steve continued onward, almost leaving Mike and I where we stood.

“Steve, hold up. Mike is still getting to his feet... and yes, I do know basic first aid.  It's just been a while,” I commented.

Steve looked back, “Fine.  Now that you're both up, come on.”

It was only about a hundred feet further on that we noticed another portal.  This one was another two young trees lashed together with the expected meat hook hung from the apex.  Hung from the hook was a black piece of cloth.

Steve, again, was the first to reach the portal and retrieve the article hanging from the hook.  It was a black sports bra.

Steve's concern for Sara returned in an instant. “What the fucking hell?  If these are all Sara's clothes, she's almost fucking naked.”

Mike, still a little delirious from the pain in his leg, started, “Yeah, so far, hat, shirt, shoes, socks and pants.  If this is the sixth portal, then yes, she only has one article of clothing left.”

Steve quickly grew irate, “She would never be naked in the woods.  Definitely not in a thunderstorm!”  He glared at Mike.  “What the fuck are you implying?”

Mike held up his hands in a show of peace. “I'm not implying anything.  Steve, calm down.  Chris and Tim think she's Inanna.  They're reliving the story.  We just need to find her.”

Before Steve could respond, Mike fell slightly, leaning on my shoulder for help staying upright.  I helped him out and got him back to his feet.

While I was helping Mike back to his feet, Steve had been in quiet contemplation. “You're right.  We need to push on.  We're nearly there.”

No sooner than Steve finished his statement, there was another female scream and the laughter arose again.

We all froze in place, listening.  What direction did the scream come from?  We listened.

I was almost drowned out when I pointed and exclaimed, “That way!”

What drowned me out was the laughter, once again, coming from all around us, now louder than ever.

80,What has happened to me? Plagued by this memory.,1301266046,"Hello, My name is William. I live in a town in Southern Florida. My friend Michael has what we call ""The sight"". He can see Aura's and create empathic links, make out the shapes and hear whispers of the dead.

Years ago when Michael was a child there was a boy who lives down the road every day he would walk down the road and see this boy and wave, Eventually one day came and the boy was gone and my friend saw a dark cloaked figure pointing his finger at the house where the boy would lay, While holding a detailed wooded scythe. Sounds corny but the fear in his eyes told me the truth. The next morning the boy was found to be deceased. Michael not knowing what had happened or the slightest idea that he has seen death in its purist form. He moved on.

My background.. When I was younger I would see movies and TV shows on the occult. Ghost stories, etc. I would surf the internet and I read up on Satanism. I was never one to believe in a god or anything other then, but it grasped me. I read over and over on black magic and other things like demonic rituals. I played around but the more I played and the more I was consumed by the religion Satanism. The more darker my life became. I began to get more paranoid and have insane dreams that I would wake up in tears, Feeling dark unnerving presences at night. I put it beside me and attempted myself at a normal life and eventually this chronicle of my life was closed and forgotten.

In the summer of 2009 I was staying the night at Michaels house along with his brother, His crush, and our youngest friend who was also female. We were at a park maybe a 15 minute walk from his house, we continued walking home and he was being, restless running ahead and running back. We came before the end of this property next to a church almost right buy his house. He ran ahead and never came back. 
Thinking nothing of it we continued out way to his house talking but we all felt kind of.. A chill like something was extremely wrong.

We arrived at the house and we looked for Michael. His crush and I found him in his room, He was crying his eyes out and I sat beside him and she held his hands. Even the dog came up to him and started licking him and he pushed her away with his foot and his crush did not like that. She got angry and walked out with the dog and we talked.

He told me his story. He told me what he saw. In the field that black cloaked figure was standing there wit a skeleton grin. Knowing what happened last time and now more mature about it he was scared and ran home fearing for his very life.

His brother came in looking for his crush. She ran out of the house and we could not find her. His brother already knowing the story began to panic when he told him what he saw. We left the house in search for her.. Michael ran off alone to search ahead. His brother, I and the younger one went on a different route. We started walking back to the park. As we walked we felt a extremely heavy presence.

So heavy that it was like he was crawling on our shoulders and whispering our worst fears into our ears. Began to see crows, Man of them flying and perching next to us. Watching us like we entertainment. Like they were waiting for us to be sucked into the Abyss.
As we walked the birds fallowed and the moon was gone. Just a black and dark grey cloudy sky. Sky. As I walked on the pavement my feet began to burn.. Like I was walking on hot coals. Knowing I know more then they do they held my hands as we walked to the park and around that area. As we were alone and began to get misty and darker they began to panic. I started walking instinctively and whisper small prayers.
After what seemed like ages we returned to the house and found him with his crush there. All shaken up and her fine we all told he what happened. To this day she thinks it was a poor joke and we have no explaination of what even happened or if it was just sheer paranoia. These memories plague me. Wondering if I was just scare, insane or if something was really stalking us. We made a pact never to speak of it again.

81,They're after me...,1301262682,"This isn't my story, but it sure as hell freaked me out, and I thought it would fit nicely here at /nosleep. OP [here](http://www.scp-wiki.net/they-re-after-me) 

I don't know what to do anymore. I’m so scared and I can't trust anyone.

I went camping about three weekends ago in the Huntsville national forest in Texas. Me and three friends that came home for the weekend, they are all in college and usually we all get together at least once a year, old friends from high school. For the camping trip we planned to go backpacking deep in the forest, live off of fish that we catch and animals that we can trap. We have been doing this for awhile in Texas and in numerous places, Arizona, Colorado (if anyone is familiar with the Spanish peaks there), New Mexico, so we‘re pretty much used to anything you‘d encounter out there.

It was my turn to pick where we went camping, so I chose Huntsville (more accurately it’s Huntsville/New Waverly). So we drive up there park our car in a camping park spot and start walking off into the forest. We had some laughs along the way, everyone catching up with eachother's lives. We walked until it started to get dark and set up camp where we stopped. Everyone gathered wood to make a fire and we set our tent up. And we do what we always do: try and scare each other with weird stories.

Around this time we started to smell something very faint. It was noticeable, but not overbearing. We couldn't put our finger on what it was, so we just carried on. Mike had to go piss and he walked off in the forest. A second later he come running back, piss all down his jeans like he’d missed really bad. Immediately we all crack up and throw some jokes at him. Then we noticed that he was white as snow and trying to catch his breath. He starts screaming for us to follow him, and runs off.

We all get serious and go follow him, not knowing what the problem was. We start to hear a faint scream and crying in the distance, in the direction we were running. It was pitch black away from the camp and Mike had the only flash light (we left ours at the camp, he had his from his trip taking a piss), so at this stage we didn’t have much choice but to follow the light, which was frantically pointing here and there in front of him.

The scream gets closer and Mike starts to slow down. We then notice a ratty old cabin that looked like it was abandoned, except for a faint light that we could see from one of the old mildew covered windows. The crying was intense: whoever it was couldn't breathe enough to let out a full yell. We all followed Mike up to the front door and we could all hear the crying from inside. As soon as he knocked on the door it stopped.

We all waited and heard really heavy footsteps walking fast to the door. There was a giant slam against the door and the sound of a bolt unlocking. Then nothing. We waited for a bit, knocked a few more times, but still nothing happened. We walked around the house (there was no fucking way any of us were leaving each other’s side) and noticed a window, which was a good way up. Alex took a deep breath and said asked us to give him a boost so he could see inside. Me and Mike lifted him up to the window. We watched him brush away dirt and webs from the window and place his face close to the window to try and see something.

There was a quick beat. Then suddenly he breathed in fast and let out a loud scream. Then he fell back from the window, screaming bloody murder the whole way. We all tried to calm him down but he was hysterical. We went to him but he started to shake, punch, kick, you name it, and then took off towards the camp.

None of us wanted to be separated so we all ran close behind him. We caught up to him and grabbed him and set him down. The fire was dying out so I grabbed some nearby wood that we collected added it to the fire. My hands were shaking and I had to do something. I went back to Alex and we all tried to calm him down. He wouldn't he kept screaming and was breathing so hard that he eventually fainted.

All of us are terrified now, and we all kept the fire high until sunrise. Periodically Alex kept waking up, screaming just like before. By sunrise he was up and looked catatonic, just mumbling to himself and whimpering.

Me and Mike decide to go look at the cabin now it was daylight. We searched where we thought it was, except there was nothing there. Nothing at all. The indistinct smell from last night had now grown into a very strong smell of something dead, something stale. We headed back to the camping site. When we got there we found Alex had chewed into the sides of his face and swallowed so much blood that he was throwing up. John was at his back, and he looked like he was about to die from exhaustion. I guess we all looked that way, I just didn't notice until I saw his face. Alex said quietly that we need to leave. Now.

We all started to pack up the tent. It started to rain really heavily (it was about noon) and the sky started to grow really dark. Alex started to go into a panic. He went and grabbed a big stick and yelled at us to leave it and leave, now, or he‘d knock us out and drag us out of there himself. Mike started to yell at him, and they started to fight. We broke it up and finished packing, and then started to make our way back. After a little while we arrived at a creek we had crossed the previous day, only it was flooded over, and the water was moving to fast for us to cross it. Alex started to scream again, yelling at Mike for taking his time packing up the tent when we could have gotten out of here. This went on for a while until we finally convinced Alex to calm down and tell us what happened.

He said as soon as he put his face to the glass, a face on the other side did the same thing, and started to smile really big. It had dark eyes and a dark mouth which was much bigger then Alex's, as the smile got as large as it could. A giant shadow behind it swung something down and sliced it‘s face off. The face was stuck to the window, and he said it started to laugh quietly as it slid down. Mike, still pissed off (and though he wouldn‘t admit it, beginning to get freaked out), started to argue with him again. We eventually started to follow the creek for a way to cross.

We then started to see toys floating in the creek. Really old toys, old Barbie dolls and baby dolls. This wasn't like any old trash floating in the creek, though… this was a lot of barbies, a lot of baby dolls. One washed towards the side and Mike picked it up. It had some kind of voice chip that was dying and started to say some gurgling words we couldn't understand, followed by it’s sad excuse for laughter. Then it sounded like it was whispering. We thought the batteries must be dying, he threw it down.

We kept going, and the sun was starting to set. Alex was freaking out more now, and was whimpering and breathing heavily. We all started to see shadows move behind trees, something we all called BS on until we all were seeing it. It was barely light out and we stop as we see the cabin right in front of us. None of us knows what to think. Mike says “This is bull, I’m going in there.” Alex tries to stop him. We all do, all of us just wanted to go home. Mike says to all of us to fuck off, do our own thing, he doesn't care anymore, this is all bull.

We start to hear hundreds of the same sort baby doll as before, laughing, whispering and trying to sing. We start to move forward past the cabin, all of us, and kept pushing forward. We smelled something dead in the air, something stale. The same something as before. We started to hear something crying, and something screaming. We kept on going. We eventually crossed the creek and left the woods. We get back to our vehicle and got in. Its pitch black, and we drive. We are about to get on the 45 to Houston but the road is under construction and can't be accessed. It points to a detour. As we head towards the detour it seems to be small, bumpy dirt road going into the woods.

We then see a young girl come up to us. She looks like she was in trouble, young and pretty. She approaches the passenger side door and she looks like she‘s really drugged up, or beaten up. Alex doesn't roll down the windows, nor does he open the door. She reaches for the handle and he immediately locks it. She puts her face on the window and starts to smile really big. We floor it, Alex starts to cry and scream and we are all breathing heavy. We finally cut on a street that takes us to the 45 and we take it the whole way. When we get back to my apartment everyone doesn't know what to say and we all break apart and go our separate ways.

Mike messages me later and says he is going to go back. I try to convince him not to and all he does is say it was our own minds that were screwing with us. I think he just went to prove to himself he wasn’t scared. I can smell that stench everywhere now. I don't go out anymore, I just stay in and don't answer the door. Last week everyone I met was acting really strange, people that I knew for a long time and total strangers. My own dad, when I went to his place to eat supper with him he just watched me, strangely, when I was sitting down. He didn't say a word the whole time. I kept asking him “What’s wrong?” He just slowly shook his head.

When I was leaving to go home I turned to wave. He had black eyes and an open mouth like he was in pain. When I started to walk back he shut the door and bolted it. I stayed there knocking and knocking. Nothing. I called him, his phone was disconnected. I even called the police. Halfway through the questions they were asking me the connection started to fade into static. I could hear a faint mumbling, singing and laughing.

Mike has completely vanished. There is not even a record of him being alive. When I call Alex’s house they talk to me like I’m some salesman. They say they don't know any Alex and to please stop calling. The person who tells me that is Alex‘s mother. I can’t get ahold of John. Someone knocked on my door and when I went to look I saw a face completely covering the peephole and a giant smile started to form.

I called the cops again and instead of it turning into static they got really strange. “Sir, are you affected by any drugs at the moment?” “No.” “Are you coming home anytime soon?” “Excuse me?” “Come home.” and the phone call ended. My mail slot swings every now and then. Someone is sliding pieces of baby dolls through it. I try to call people now and all I can hear is static and bad baby doll noises and this crying and screaming. My TV is busted but when I go to piss I can hear it on. I might be going insane.

Whoever lives above me started to scream in pain and crying deeply recently. I hear giant footsteps from their apartment, I hear bangs and something falling to the ground. From the neighbors to the right of my apartment I hear what sounds like a baby that never gets tended too and then it sounds like a baby doll whose batteries are dying. My phone has been ringing now and it’s Alex telling me things in a language that I have never heard before, nor could even manage to repeat. I kept getting emails of pictures of black and small colorations, now I can't even access my email. Someone knocks on the door, then they slam against it. I hear the bolts unlocking one by one and I run to make sure to lock all of them back and sit down crying.

What do I do? My electricity keeps dimming. My water, sinks, bath, shower, all smell like something dead. I keep seeing a shadow of someone behind me raising something up in the air, and I just take off to the other side of the apartment with my head against the wall. I have boarded my windows shut, someone was throwing rocks through them. I never could see who. I have boarded my bedroom in, I hear crying and screaming in there now. And right now while I’m typing this I can see the reflection off the computer screen of some shadow behind me.

82,"Premonitions, episode 1.",1301258280,"*NOTE: So I submitted a story that happened to me, and said that I had plenty more stories where that one came from.  I asked if anyone was interested in hearing me out, I'd post.  I got a few requests, so here goes!*

These aren't going to be in any particular order.  I'll start with my mom's experiences that I can remember.  This one I witnessed particularly, so I feel it's a good place to start, as I was able to actually verify it myself and didn't just 'hear it from the wolf's mouth.'

I wasn't even a teenager yet.  Back then, we used to go to Spain for months at a time, I spent a large portion of my life there, and had some very close friends from throughout the years.  One of them was my best friend Juan Jose.

Every summer we'd play **a lot**.  We'd do everything from fishing, to playing soccer on a daily basis, I have many fond memories and experiences.  His grandfather was a great guy, funny, compassionate, and kind.  He would let us in the storage room which had countless toys and games and we'd spend hours at a time over there.

Like every summer, I would come back to America, bitter that I'd have to spend the rest of the year in this country.  I always couldn't wait to go back, but life is life.

My dad has always gotten up early to go to work, usually at around 6 in the morning.  Growing up, when he'd wake up for work, I'd wake up to take his spot on my parents' bed, which was always so much bigger and more comfortable than my bed.

On one occasion, I awoke on a sunny weekend morning.  It was one of those abrupt wakings where you are kind of confused still.  I looked over and my mom was sleeping.  As if my gaze jolted her, she immediately woke up.

Her nerves were on end, she was shaking and tears were forming in her eyes.  I watched a tear roll down her cheek as she was trying to maintain composure.

""He's must be gone,"" she told me.  I had no idea what she was talking about.

""Who's gone?  What are you talking about?"" I responded.

""Juan Jose's grandfather.  Something is terribly wrong, I had a dream where I knew he was dead.  Something's really wrong.""

I tried to comfort her and tell her it was only a dream.  After all, dreams can't hurt you right?  Dreams are just dreams.

She was pacing around the house nervously for the next hour.  She was mumbling to herself from time to time, trying to rationalize what happened.  I thought it very strange, but as the afternoon unfolded, i quickly understood.

She called my grandmother in Spain.  She does this about once a month, mostly to check up on the house we have there, to make sure the bills are being paid, and just to check up on the family.  As she called, my grandmother picked up.

""You're never going to believe what happened yesterday.."" my grandmother anxiously told my mother.

""Did Manolo die?"" Asked my grandmother, already expecting the answer.

""Yes...how did you...did someone tell you?"" wondered my grandmother.

""I had a dream last night, mom.  You know the ones I'm talking about.  I saw his wife mourning at a church, she was telling me something was terribly wrong, that it wouldn't be alright.  In my dream I was trying to comfort her.  I kept telling her everything's going to be okay, and she was telling me that it couldn't be okay, that it was too late."" my mom responded.

And just like that, it was confirmed.  I had witnessed this one from the moment she woke up, watched her nervously anticipate the events, hoping she would be wrong.  Unfortunately, she wasn't wrong.  I watched the look on her face twist as she realized that what she experienced was a reality.

A humbling experience, to say the least.

If there is a demand for some more experiences, don't hesitate to let me know.  I don't want to clutter the subreddit with my instances if no one is interested :P",nosleep,M3nt0R,/r/nosleep/comments/gco2f/premonitions_episode_1/
83,I will never sleep again,1301255199,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z6xGU2_g9s,nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/gcnfh/i_will_never_sleep_again/
84,On the topic of dreams...,1301241897,"So, I just found this a couple hours ago, and while reading a topic about dreams, I remembered one of mine in particular that left me disoriented and pretty unsettled for several days if not weeks. 

I'll start off with some background. I have extremely vivid, detailed, long dreams. All the fucking time. Sometimes its awesome, sometimes its terrifying. I don't do drugs/alcohol, and I'm not depressed. I just tend to ponder subjects that no one really has the answer to, and usually those come up in my dreams.

Annnnyways, the following was a dream I experienced about 6 months ago. I'll try my best to recall every detail that went through my head:

So I'm sitting on a couch in a dark, small room. Picture yourself sitting on a couch facing a wall. We will call that wall the ""front"" wall. The ""left"" wall had a small window, and for some reason I could only face those two walls the entire dream. 

Both walls had a strange hue to them. Kind of a dark cyan/green color. Not the paint color per se, but as if the lights were off and someone turned on a dim lamp with a cyan/green bulb. 

Picture yourself deep in the ocean. Silent... dark... almost foreboding. Those kind of pictures and feelings came to mind as I sat in this room.

The couch was a dull red. 

Its raining in the darkness outside of my small little window. I can see the rain tapping the glass, and hear it faintly, but definitely not as loud as it should be. This seems normal to me. I hear nothing but this tapping. No rustling of the leaves and trees outside, nor the wind. Its as if someone has draped a blanket over me that dulls the noise of the outside world.

I feel as if I have one priority while sitting in this room, but at the moment it is not clear to me. My thoughts run across random memories from my childhood (I do not remember what they are now, only that they had an impact on me). The feeling hanging over me is dense and macabre... almost like it is holding me down on that couch, my back hunched over... my head slumped awkwardly, forcing my vision into the corner between the wall with the window and the wall in front of me.

I stare into that corner for God knows how long. A vague gloom sweeps over me, and I look at my feet. 

Between my feet, laying on the wooden floor, is a double-barrel shotgun. I am not surprised. I just stare at it as the rain moans relentlessly outside. My thoughts are dominated by the prospect of the shotgun at my feet. Its almost as if I relinquish control of my body to something else. Any second thoughts are erased as quickly as they come, and I reach down and lay the shotgun in my lap... both barrels staring convincingly into my eyes. 

I can see down into the darkness of the barrels, and, being a religious person, I silently beg myself to put it down. My fear of ""what would happen"" reaches almost unbearable levels... but I keep going, with an almost puppet-like pace. My eyes keep shifting into that dark corner... and then back to the shotgun. 

And by some unspoken impulse, my view changes to the wall behind me. Its like I am outside of my body now, looking at the couch and the wall behind it. The shotgun lays on the couch, but my body is absent. I look upon the wall and something inside me twists and... I feel grotesque, and disturbed. The wall is covered in blood, as if someone took an open paint bucket of blood and heaved its contents carelessly towards the wall. I still do not feel scared, but I do feel helpless, tired, and sad. The image fades and I am back on the couch... pointing the shotgun at my forehead. 

I pull the trigger. 

No noise. No pain. Just thoughts. I remember thinking... ""So this is what its like to be dead."" I hadn't realized that I was now awake. My face was buried headfirst into my pillow, and my covers were soaked in perspiration. The thunder and rain roared outside... 

I don't remember sleeping for the rest of the night. From that point on, that dream held on to my thoughts with ferocious intensity. It put me in a short period of depression. And to this day the dream brings up feelings indescribable with words. Sorry for such a long story, but maybe it will be interesting to a few of you. If there are any dream experts out there as well, I'd be happy for someone to try and tackle the meanings of it all. Thanks for reading.

85,Why would they listen to me?,1301214133,"This will be my first contribution to /nosleep, and most certainly not the last. During my short life, I've seen, heard, and experienced far beyond what I can rationalize, but am usually too cynical to put what's in front of me into perspective.

For my first entry, I decided to tell perhaps the most chilling story I've ever been told, because shortly thereafter, I witnessed it first hand.

Fishing towns are all alike. I say that because the infrastructure is usually the same. You have your captains, some good, some bad, your drunks, an array of people looking to work, and more stories about being on the boat than you can imagine.

 One particular night, I had decided to visit a friends boat and hang out for a while, it had already gotten pitch black at 3pm (being alaska in the winter), and although its never really been an issue, I despise it now.

 When I arrived down at his boat, he told me he had to run to the store to buy some liquor/cigs, leaving me with the two other people there, one of my friends deckhands, and an older man who, by the wear on his face, had certainly lived a full life.

 We bullshit for a good twenty minutes, when the old man, who proudly proclaimed his name to be, ""Arthur! after my father, and his father before him"" decided to take the conversation into.. darker territories.

With his grave, scratchy voice, he asked us, ""So, either of you have any spook stories?"" We shook are heads, not sure what he meant. His face turned gaunt, and said, ""I'll tell you the story I've why I picked up the bottle (drinking)"".

I'll never forget what he said next, and I'll do my best to scribe what he said from (repressed) memory.

""About ten years ago I decided to join ship with a drinking buddy of mine named Big Bear, that native son bitch can hold his liquor! We went out to the fishing grounds round' midnight, an anchored up. AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT! The damn batteries died. We were on the inside of the bar, 30 feet off the beach, safe for the tides, you know, but had to wait till' the fuckin' next day to get our buddy out there and get us going.

We got ourselves sauced up real good that night! DAMN! I got drunk! hahahahaha (In his wheezy, ""I've smoked since I was 10 laugh)
I can't remember how in the hell it happened; I ended up dropping tent (sleeping slang, I guess?) on the roof of the boat, bout damn near froze to death, ifferwasn't that alcohol. But here's the thing, I can't figurr out what happened. It was three or so in the goddamn morning, and my head is hurting something fierce; I'm freezing my ass off an' I start to prop up my body against the light pole so I can light a cig.

As I lit it, I looked towards the shore of the beach, and noticed something, it looked like it was waving its arms, trying to get my attention. I started to laugh real good! thinking maybe big bear decided to go for a late night swim.

I dropped down on deck and went into the cab to grab a spotlight, and I seen Bear sleeping in his bunk, ya know, so I'm thinking who the hell is that on shore?

I grabbed the light and headed back out; sure enough, this guy is still on the beach, not even moving. I turn the spotlight on, that fucker is bright, and point the sun bitch straight at him.

I think, maybe, Well, I wish it was just the sauce playing tricks with my mind, cause' I can't in my right mind say what I was looking at.

He.. or IT I mean was the size of a man, but it's face... it's face was wrong, I don't know how to describe it, but it's face was... wrong.""

It started to walk into the water towards me, ann I start hollering at him, ya know, you get near my boat an I'll shoot you Sun' BITCH!

It went into the water, just walked into the water, didn't swim or nothing, just strided in like it was in a goddamn pool.

I tried waking bear up but that native son bitch was out cold, and I hear the anchor line making this like ""chink"" sounds, like there's tension on it, then going slack, ya know?

I went outside with the spotlight again, and I sa..""

For the first time in his story, Arthur had paused, mid-sentence. My friend and I looked at each other nervously as a look of sheer terror passed over Arthur's face. The blood draining from his face was proportional to the words he got out next.

""It was that.. that thing I sss-seen on the shore, it it climbed up the anchor line and was climmin' into the boat. It ain't right, NOPE, IT AIN'T RIGHT I TELL YOU. 

I seen a lot of things in this life, the way it moved ain't right.""

""WHAT happened?"" I inquired, to be completely honest, this man could tell a story, he had managed to interest me enough to where I was actually feeling a little nervous about being on the boat.

He took a deep drag on his cigarette, and said, ""That fucking thing tried getting on my boat, I hollered at it, even grabbed a buoy pole an tried hitting the damn thing, it sounded like slime when the pole hit. You know, I started hollering for bear to grab the damn gun, and the son bitch finally woke up all kinds of pissed off, and comes out on deck. He sees me with the damn buoy pole on the front side of the boat, probably thought I'd finally lost it hahahahahaha. I looked over the side, where the anchor chain goes into the water, and its not there. I tell you I didn't sleep a fuckin' WINK! stayed up for 48 hours drinkin' and fishin'.

Heh, when the sun cammeup that morning, I looked over onnde anchor line and seen the chains covered in slime, scared the shit out of me. I'll never go to ""fishing spot"" again.""

I figured it to be an interesting story, at best, said my dues, and headed out shortly thereafter.

Then it happened to me.


I went out to the fishing grounds some months later, and headed out to my spot where the opener was scheduled to be at, unfortunately for me, I forgot it was the same spot Arthur had been when he told that story. I left two days early, so I could get a priority set (in fishing, laying your net on the point is a first come, first serve basis). In any event, it was roughly midnight, and I decided to head to bed. I was awoken during the night by the sound of this ""chink, chink, chink"" sound, and thought it nothing more than waves playing with my boat.

When I woke up the next morning, I had what most consider a nervous breakdown.

It was early on in the morning, the sun was just getting up in the sky, and I hopped out of my bunk. As I hopped out, my foot slipped in something, and I skidded across the floor and completely ate shit. I looked down to see if I had sprung an oil leak, or something, and notice these HUGE sets of.... slime? prints going from my cabin door, right next to the bunk.

I start to remember Arthur's story, and the nerves are truly tested. I threw on some boots, and headed out on deck. I wish I hadn't.

Those same sets, like that of a person walking in mud, are leading from my cabin door, to the anchor line. I look down the chain, and see it completely covered in this stuff.

I immediately pulled up the anchor, and started cruising around the bay; no boats in sight. I hop on the radio, noone had even left town yet. I was completely alone, and even if someone else had done it, where in the HELL did they get all this goop, how could they have made the prints perfect in spacing, and size, everytime? Most of all, who would have known I'd heard that story? The only people who did were still in town, 12 hours of driving time away (over water).

I ended up going back into town that night. I haven't returned to that spot since.



TL;DR - Read the user comments.


Epilogue - A year later I managed to tell my story to my father, another fisherman, and he turned very grave. A close friend of his had died under ""mysterious circumstances"" in that same area a few years back.

87,My aunts house,1301203275,"Okay since I have been looking up /r/nosleep for awhile I decided to tell my own creepy story.

My aunt lives alone in a large mid-nineteenth century house in central Illinois. The house has been passed down from generation to generation and hasn't changed much over the years. The coal cellar in the basement still has old tools and traces of coal. There is an old piano and many furnishings that were probably added around the turn of the century. My aunt tries to maintain the house as well as she can, but since she is all alone and doesn't make much money it's hard for her. The ceilings are cracking, antique wallpaper is peeling off the walls and no matter how lightly you step, the floors creak with age.

When I was a little kid I always hated staying in that house when we go to visit. My dad felt the same way, and many times we would just rent a hotel room for the night. My mom thought this was rude and, when it was just her and I, we usually spent the night at my aunts.

The last time I visited the house I was 18 and doing a college tour of the nearby UofI and ISU. We were only going to stay one night, but I had no idea that it was going to be the most eventful night of the weekend.

Being older, I decided I would give the house another chance to put an impression on me. I started looking through old trunks and closets that hadn't been touched in decades. I found old letter, newspaper articles, and tons of other cool stuff. I was starting to dismiss my childhood fears and started to see the house differently. Because my aunt lives alone, she only cleans three of the houses five bedrooms. One is hers, another has an antique bed that I'm almost destined to destroy, and one is covered floor to ceiling in antique dolls. There are only a few things in life that scare me, dolls are near the top. So naturally my mom took the normal room and I decided to sleep on the couch downstairs.

That night, they decided to go to bed around 10pm and I decided to watch TV on the couch downstairs. I started feeling sleepy around midnight so I turned off the TV and got comfy. As I was laying there I noticed that there was a full moon and the pale blue light illuminated the room quite well. I sat there and was relieved that I didn't need to stay in a room filled with dolls. I lied there and listened to the sound of the wind rapping on the windows. 

Then another sound came from the floor above. It was a slow creaking noise coming from the other end of the house. I passed it off as just more noise from the wind but I noticed it was getting closer and I could hear a pause between each creak. I realized very quickly that they were footsteps, walking the upstairs hallway. I breathed a sigh of relief, must be my aunt or my mom coming back from the bathroom. However, the footsteps didn't go into any of the rooms, they started approaching the stairs. The house was built so that the stairs were hidden behind a wall and a wooden door. My eyes shot to the door and noticed that it wasn't closed completely. My heart started to race that this point, ""Why would they want to come downstairs at this time of night?"" I asked myself. The footsteps started down the stairs.

Coming down very slowly, I could hear each individual step as the floorboards creaked beneath them. No voice, no breathing, no coughing, just the deliberate sound of each foot hitting the stair.

The footsteps eventually made it to the landing just behind the door. I could hear the floorboards creak when what ever it was turned to face the door. My heart was pounding out of my chest while I waited to see what happened. The door slowly opened about six inches, just enough for me to see that no one was there.

Many people I have told this to always say that it must have been a prank by my mom or my aunt since they know how much I hated staying in the house. First, they wouldn't have gone 3 years without telling me how great it was that they trolled me. Second, I stayed up all night, eyes wide open, staring at the door waiting for something to happen and nothing did. I waited 5 hours for the sun to come up before I ran over and and turned on every light I could find. I'm not sure what happened but it was definitely the creepiest thing that has ever happened to me.

88,Gravity? Or are my friend and I mentally linked?,1301202439,"Sorry I'm not very good at writing, I write code more than English...

So when I started high school I eventually made a couple of friends and we were soon inseparable. But one of said friends was very similar to myself in how we thought and reasoned on logical topics. We always knew what the other was going to ask, which was fucking strange as we often answered each others questions before they were asked (I bullshit you not, heaps of friends noticed this).

He and I used to go over and chill at each others houses often and talk on the phone heaps (totally not gay). But one night was one we wouldn't forget.

We were on a bunk bed and I was on the top bunk, and we were both right at that point where you are about to fall sleep, until...

***CRUSH!***

It momentarily felt like someone had pushed me right in the forehead with their finger (I was sleeping face up), and my head had been shoved hard into the mattress. I thought it could have been a Hypnic Jerk as I've had one before, but I suddenly realized that the bed had shaken below me at the same time it happened.
I asked my friend if he was OK and he replied ""Yeah, it just felt like I was pushed in the side of the head really hard"" (He was sleeping side on).

At this point I instantly told him that I had felt the same thing and that it was fucked up that he had felt it at the same time.


It's been a few years now since I've seen him (I Buggered off to study in the IT field, and he's changed heaps (found out over facebook)) so I'm not entirely worried about hanging out with him again.

89,The Restless Nun,1301200351,"  Ok so I suppose some backstory is in order. I am a 19 year old college student, living in a dormitory that is well known to be haunted due to its past. It was at one time a monastery, and at one point in its history, a priest brutally murdered a nun; the man was never arrested and the crime never solved. 
  
Anyway I have never had any real experience with the paranormal, to be honest, I had never before even believed that such a thing existed until that night. It was somewhere around 3AM last weekend, I was playing some computer games, listening to some music, the usual late night activities. Suddenly a slight haze came over me, and I decided that I needed to go to the bathroom. The only odd part about that is that I truly had no biological urge to go to the bathroom, I just needed to venture out of my room and walk down the hallway. 
  
As I walked out the door I noticed something strange, the silence of it all. After all, I am a college student and there are typically students making noise even until the early hours of the morning on the weekends. I began walking towards the bathroom when the hairs of my neck stood on edge. I turned around, and walking towards me slowly as a woman in her 50's, clear as day, with a somber look on her face beneath an old pair of glasses. AT this point I knew nothing of the history of the dormitory, but was still thoroughly freaked out to someone her age walking through the hallways without cleaning supplies, and dressed in such odd clothing. I asked her if she was lost, but she simply kept on walking towards me slowly, her eyes intently focused on me. I will never forget the look in her eyes, it was one of pure insanity. At this point I turned from her and ran, running down the stairs to the second floor and then back up the stairs on the otherside of the building. 
  
When I arrived back on my floor the nun was gone, so I walked back into my room. I was obviously too startled to sleep so I sat around, barely acknowledging my computer or even my television. Then, around 4AM I heard a gentle tapping on my door. I don't have a peephole on my door, so assuming it was an RA, I opened the door and was face to face with the old woman. I was paralyzed, I wanted to slam the door but I couldn't. She simply stared through me, with those horrible eyes, and this terrifying smirk. She then spoke to me 
 "" I'm not insane Father... I saw you and Edith together...that evening..."" at this point she began to cackle madly, but still nobody on my floor seemed to notice. She sharply quit her laughing and then stuck her finger into my chest...it felt so real. She continued 
"" I don't believe Arch Bishop Flaherty will be pleased... I suppose we will find out won't we?"" She cackled again, turned around and slowly walked away. 
  
I haven't gotten much sleep since that night, and I am now just sitting here hoping I don't hear a tapping on my door, as if I would answer anyway. After doing some research, I found out that the nun in question was believed to have been mentally ill. I can't help but think maybe she simply saw something she shouldn't have, and I pity her. I just hope I don't resemble the priest who gave her her eternal silence.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/gcbx3/the_restless_nun/

91,It must be glad I'm home.,1301194151,"     I am sorry for being such a mega raging bitch about some of the comments.  However, this was an experience of a lifetime.  As I explained, I grew up knowing that something wasn't quite right with my home, nevertheless I loved it.  But this ""entity"" that my entire family has experienced really seemed to grow attached to me. 
     People who have experienced similar things will tell you that ""spirits"" generally have a personality whether it's a beautiful young woman or a crotchety old man.  Ours was a playful little girl.  She just loved making us get up out of our chairs to go turn off the faucet, it was one of her favorite games.  Sure..sure you could tell me to check our plumbing but I wouldn't be submitting this story to this subreddit if the point of the story was that my plumbing was bad.  I don't need skepticism or LOLZ about my word choice, I just want someone to relate with.
     When this happened to me a few months ago, a wave of past occurrences flooded into my memory.  Being a little girl growing up in my house, I can see why she would have missed me.  And maybe in some ways...I missed her too.  That's all.  SORRY for bitchin.


This is my first submission...check this shit out.

A bit of backstory: This summer I moved out of my parents house in the country to an old college house downtown.  Growing up in this house, I grew accustomed to what I call ""spooks""(ghosts, spirits demons, whatever the fuck you want to call them).  Faucets turned themselves on, chairs jumped, lightbulbs shot out of sockets and shadows crept into my peripherals all day everyday.  These activities were confined to the original side of the house rather than the new portion that we built on once we moved in.  Coincidentally, an old woman lived and died in this house before it was ours.  Luckily for us, the ""haunted"" zone of our house is the side with the bedrooms of my brother, sister and myself.  

This past monday, I got my wisdom teeth removed.  My parents begged me to stay at home while I recovered.  I gladly accepted and I set my stuff up in my brother's old room.  After a day of napping, I fell asleep yet again at 10:30pm.  I was awoken at 11:09 by my dog crawling into bed with me.  Opening my eyes, I noticed that it was storming outside (I live in Wisconsin so the sound of rain was surprising).  I patted my dog's butt for a while, peeked at the clock, 11:10, and I fell back to sleep.  Later on, I was awoken again but this time by a severe case of cotton mouth.  I sat up, noticed the time, 1:19am, flip on the lights and realize my dog isn't in the room anymore.  Thinking nothing of his absence, I stepped out into the hallway to grab a glass of water.  On the way to the kitchen, I notice my sister dicking around on the computer.

""Hey Meghan, did you let Cooper out of my room?""
""What?  No, he has been outside since 8:00 tonight and I haven't been able to get him to come in.""

My gut drops to the floor.  I hear Cooper barking outside the door to be let in.  I can't help but wonder what crawled into bed with me if the dog had been outside the whole time.

I tell my mom the story the next day and the first words to come from her mouth were...
""Oh Kate, our ghost hasn't been acting up lately.  It must be glad you're home.""

93,After a suicide,1301189165,"I apologize in advance that this is a little long.

Bee (name changed) was a really sweet girl. She wasn't exactly innocent, nor was she a plain girl, but she always had the best intentions. Unfortunately, as you could imagine, Bee killed herself at a local playground, the one at the elementary school we both went to. This happened in 2006 and she and I were only 16. Within the week, I had two very strange dreams. They were especially startling I was close neither to Bee nor to her friends at the high school.

The first dream was the longest, and the most important of the two, and is the one I'm sharing tonight. In this dream, I go to Bee's house (she lived two blocks down the hill from me), and I see a bunch of her friends — my friends from elementary school, whom by high school I did not associate with much. They are sitting in a circle on the lawn, with my mom at the ""head"" with a cell phone that looks a little antiquated. My mother tells me to dial the phone.

I mark numbers which don't make any sense, they didn't add up to the appropriate amount of digits for a phone call either — something like 34F#8SEV589*. I had to listen to the phone as it rang.

&gt; Hello?, she asked.

&gt; B..Bee? Is that you?

&gt; Yea, hi, secaedelcielo. It's sort of odd here lately, isn't it?

At this point, I was slightly disturbed. I don't think I remembered she was dead in the dream until this point.

&gt; What do you mean?, I respond.

&gt; It's cold, and I find myself traveling a lot in the Plaza lately (the Plaza was a place kid's would hang out at after school throughout middle and high school).

&gt; ... [at this point I have nothing to say]

&gt; You know, I talk to this guy a lot. He wears this black cloak and I can hardly make out his face.

&gt; Yea..

&gt; He says he knows why I'm still here. Click-click.

&gt; Cli--

&gt; Don't say his name or he'll start following you around. He likes to hurt people, but he tells me he likes me, so I'm not afraid of him.

&gt; Oh…

&gt; The reason I'm still here is that she keeps praying for me. She won't let go. All she does is cry and cry; I hear it all the time. You know, maybe one day she's done and all but, I'm really sick of being here! [she laughs to herself a little]

&gt; You mean Kim? (at this point I realize she was the only one of Bee's friends to not be with us at the circle on her lawn)

&gt; ...

&gt; I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring her up.

&gt; Don't worry — she assured me — Click-Click's on it. He told me she'll be done soon, or maybe I'll see her soon if things go his way.

&gt; Ok.

&gt; Well it was so nice talking to you. Take care of yourself. I plan on going to [some foreign place name that almost sounded like another country] tomorrow. I have to get ready. Good-bye. You've always been so nice to me.

&gt; Bye.

And at that point, the grass felt the gentle breeze of what I could only imagine was her soul sweeping over the town. The phone hung up, but there was still some kind of tone, and I didn't see anyone with me anymore. They had all left. I was too petrified to return to my house, and decided to walk up to the elementary school where she killed herself. Before I reached it, I woke up.

That dream I haven't shared since I told a close friend in high school. Oddly enough, shortly after her death, there was a French song released by MC Solaar called ""Clic"" or ""Clic-clic"", which of course gave me shivers.

94,"Strange, prophetic dreams.",1301185821,"I thought you guys could appreciate this. 
My room in my parents house is in the basement which I'm 100% sure that I'm sharing it with spirit, well everything but my room. Needless to say there is definitely a supernatural feel in the basement and I'm very sensitive to it. That is a story for another time though, I wanted to share some dreams I had over my break.

I spent my spring break at my parents house as I am too poor to go anywhere fun. Well probably after the first night I start having very vivid dreams. One involved being able to create Key Lime Pie out of thin air, the next day I wake up and my mom made Key Lime Pie. I was just kind of surprised at this, didn't take it seriously.

The next night I had a dream where my mom utterly destroyed me in Tennis. That day I was destroyed in tennis. This dream did not surprise me at all. I attributed it to thinking about tennis and (unfortunately) how much better my mom is at it. 

My last dream I had was the longest and most vivid. My roommate is leaving for Afghanistan on tuesday and I had a dream that he died. Not how he died mind you, just that he died. Everything that I did or experienced in the dream was all in first person, like I was in the dream. It was like watching a movie and the scenes changed suddenly. 
I spoke at his funeral and I burst into tears at the podium. His best friend came up to me to help me speak the rest of my speech. There were American flags and it was in this large auditorium. The next scene I'm sitting in a bar my roommate and I go to. I'm with his friend and there are 3 beers at the table. One for me, one my roommate and one for his friend. Me and his friend are telling stories about my roommate. Laughing and crying a little. Last thing I remember was the waitress was wondering what we wanted to do with my roommates beer. 

That really spooked me and I woke up incredibly sad. It was like I had lived that and experienced that as if it was real. I was sad for most of the day and really had to convince myself that he was still alive. Of all the supernatural things I've experienced, prophecy was never one. I never really felt like I received that gift and I still doubt I do.

96,I was almost in tears,1301184379,"I live in an old neighbourhood, in an old city, in an old apartment building. I'm normally a brave guy, late twenties and I live alone in a bachelor suite. Last week I was working on a paper on my laptop in the early morning. I had taken a shower about an hour earlier, and while I was typing on my laptop, I heard my tub dripping water. At that moment I glanced at the time to pace myself while doing my paper, it was 4:45am (my sleeping schedule has been really chaotic lately). The dripping continued and I thought nothing of it really, it had dripped before, but I didn't understand why it had been a whole hour after my shower without it dripping. Perhaps I didn't notice the tub dripping before, but it seemed like it just started dripping.

While I was reading/typing I noticed the dripping gradually getting louder and louder. Within a few minutes it sounded like someone was stepping in my tub, then suddenly it almost sounded like light stomping. I pushed my computer chair back and the stomping stopped, but I still heard the loud dripping. It's hard to describe, but I've never heard it before. It was almost like small feet stomping in my tub. Almost like a child was sitting on the edge of the tub stomping in one spot, while using one foot.

I proceeded slowly to the bathroom, and then I heard someone from the bathroom area with a soft voice that I didn't recognise call out ""Jake"" ... that's my name. I flicked on the light in the bathroom and saw nothing. But I momentarily felt a breeze over my head, which led to my hair standing on end. I was thoroughly frightened, I was almost in tears. I knew something was there at that moment. This was not normal

That was the only time I heard it (thank God). I've been living in this apartment building for a year now as well.

The only other thing is, sometimes when I'm in my bedroom, (I say bachelor suite because my bedroom is separated with a wall, but no door, just a wide entrance way into my bedroom), normally only at night, I often simply hear my fridge door closing. It never happens when I'm in the kitchen or anytime I can see the fridge. When I hear it, I have tried to immediately look to see if I see or feel anything, but nothing is ever there. I can't explain it either. I honestly don't understand how/why I hear the fridge closing.

It would lash out at me and continue coming at me, stretching my psyches tension. It felt like hours had gone by as it was chasing and striking at me. I could not make this figure out nor could I fight back.

I began telling myself it was not real. Again and again until eventually everything went black and there was nothing but darkness and silence. I will never be able to forget this and as I type this my heart tightens with fear. A face not of man or woman came forward with eyes of bright glowing scarlet, no pupils just Scarlet, and yelled ""This is real,"" in a tone not possible by human vocal cords.

When I did, I made full eye contact with a man - pale skin, medium brown hair and dark red eyes. He had no books, no bags and did not look like a student. My natural instinct was to gasp but I felt like I couldn't. I have never felt someone stare so hard at me and as cheesy as it sounds I feel like he looked right through me.

99,The Midnight Man,1301175312,"So I am a huge collector of infopics and other informative documents online. Browsing through them one day, I came across one describing the Midnight Man Game (For those not familiar, http://imgur.com/Vbrr1 ). I have never claimed to be an intelligent man, and I've always been a thrill seeker, especially when it comes to paranormal stuff. So despite any rational sense that would have otherwise told me this was a horrendous idea, I tried it.

So with my piece of paper in hand, my name and drop of blood on it, and my small candle which would supposedly be my barrier from this evil creature I am allowing into my home, I step outside. As instructed I placed my candle on the piece of paper and proceeded with the ritual, upon the 22nd knock I could feel something wasn't right. I began wandering around my house, candle in hand with salt in the base of the candle holder. The house seemed darker than normal, and my candle seemed dimmer. Walking around I could barely see anything, if not for the fact I was quite familiar with my home, I might not have been able to get around. At this point I was almost tip-toeing, I could feel another presence in my home and I was terrified. About 12:45 I made the mistake of entering my bedroom, walking closer to my closet I heard whispering behind me, to this day I don't know what it was saying, I was too petrified. Looking behind me at the door leading to the hallway there was a figure, it looked like an adult man, but it was dark and almost see through. As soon as I laid eyes on him my candle went out and my heart stopped. I grabbed my lighter as fast as possible and with my hands shaking like mad I quickly re-lit my candle. The figure in the doorway looked upon me, then left into the hall. I stood there for a moment, despite all the eerie feelings I had before that encounter, none of it had quite sunk in until that moment. I knew it wouldn't be long before the Midnight Man came back for me, so reluctantly I moved into the hallway, taking short steps and trying to be as silent as possible. I moved to the stairway leading downstairs, the downstairs being very open so I could see into the living room below. I could feel something down there, from the faint glow on my candle it would appear as if there was a figure sitting on my couch. Suddenly it spoke to me again, ""I've been waiting for you"" it said. It stood up, and approached the base of the stairs. It began to walk up the stairs, my upstairs is built in such a way that there is one hallway and 3 rooms, leaving very little options available to me to escape my pursuer. 

Knowing the rules of the game, I had at least 10 seconds after my candle would go out to re-lite it. It would appear at this point I had no other option, I waited until the Midnight Man got close enough up the stairs to diminish my flame and made my move, I charged at him with all my speed, narrowly dodging him moving down the stairs. I felt his hand on me, as if he was trying to capture me and put me under his spell, but I was within the 10 seconds allowed. As I hit the landing at the bottom of the stands I relit the candle, and proceeded to run into the kitchen, affording me multiple exits. Rule one of the Midnight game is to keep moving during the Midnight Game, I knew this but at this point I was petrified and slightly out of breath from my mad dash. I set down on the counter and took a few minutes to catch my breath and calm down. I checked my watch, 1:30am, another 2 hours of this nightmare. I rested in the kitchen for what seemed like days, every bump, every step in the distance, every whisper in the distance, they all take me down a peg, with every passing moment I feel my spirit crumbling and grow closer to tears. The Midnight Man finally found my sanctuary in the kitchen, and I quickly moved away. I stayed downstairs for the next while, the downstairs of my home has more loops and interconnecting rooms, allowing me to avoid him. 

I continued avoiding the Midnight Man for another hour, and at 2:30 I made the mistake of allowing myself to get pushed upstairs. I retreated to my bedroom once more, only this time when the Midnight Man extinguished my candle, he continued toward me. I drew my hand up with my lighter to re lite the candle, flick, flick, I sparked the flint repeatedly but that was it, sparks, no flame. I had lost this game, but I knew I must at least protect myself, I poured the salt around in a circle around me. The Midnight Man approached me, growing closer, with each step I grew less and less confident that my circle would protect me, but I had no choice but to hope. The Midnight Man grew closer, and as he finally grew within reach of my circle he reached out his hand. I closed my eyes, preparing myself to face my worst nightmare for the next hour, and as I waited I grew more calm. But the nightmares never came, I opened my eyes and looked right at the Midnight Man, his hand trapped right outside my barrier. We sat in this manner for the next hour, staring at one another, I can't help but feel like we bonded during this time, like he was my friend, but I know even now that if my barrier hadn't prevented him from doing so he would have forced my nightmares. Finally, at 3:32am, he moved, looking at me one last time, and at 3:33, he turned around and walked away. I waited inside my barrier until morning, the house felt calm as he left, but I didn't. The memories to this day still haunt me, and every night at 12am I still fear that he'll come back for me.",nosleep,Khajor,/r/nosleep/comments/gc5dl/the_midnight_man/

1,The angry presence.,1301168492,"I must note that the *same* thing happened to my older brother, I found out.  He didn't like talking about it, but he had mentioned something about it.

A little background.  My family lives in our own house in what used to be a suburb and is now a small city.  We've been here at least 16 years, and there's never really been anything 'crazy' in the house, but there have been isolated incidents such as the one I will tell.

It must have been a night in October, when the fall is around and it's not really cold yet, but it's not warm enough to leave windows open or anything.  The windows in my house were all closed, so there was no 'draft'.  Anyway, even with windows and doors open, the doors inside the house have NEVER opened or closed without a human hand assisting.

So I was a little bit tired and decided to go to bed since it was a weeknight.  I closed my door, got changed, and lay in bed for a little.  I noticed my bedroom door opened to about an inch, and closed slightly, leaving it only a crack open.  Just like that.

Almost immediately I heard a panting sound.  Some heavy breathing make its way from the door, past the foot of my bed.  Suddenly, the breathing turned from the foot of my bed, along the length of my bed getting closer and closer.

I could hear it closer with each coming second.  I heard it to the point where it was right by my face, and I felt a pressure on my neck.  I couldn't speak up or scream, and breathing was difficult.  Within a few seconds the pressure eased, and the breathing started distancing itself again.

The breathing made its way along the length of my bed, distancing itself more, around the foot of my bed again.  The door opened up again to about an inch, and it closed again, as if being pulled by a vacuum/draft of movement, but the door actually came to a close.

When the door closed I darted up and turned on the light.  It wasn't sleep paralysis, as I had been laying down only a couple of minutes after getting changed.  This is the same room and bed that my brother had had the same thing happen to him years before.  I hadn't thought of the incident since he had told me years before, and I had not been in the 'scary movie' mindset from watching a horror movie or anything.

One of the many stories I have in me, if you are interested in more tales, I'll be more than happy to divulge them.

2,A night in the woods. (cliche I know),1301168000,"This story comes from when I was a younger man in the time when multi-day camping trips were a normal thing for me and is entirely true.  

My friend and I were deep in the Kentucky woodlands one humid August night, day 2 of a 3 day excursion. The fire roared from the overly dry fuel we fed it, lighting the forest at least 2 dozen feet into the darkness. As the fire died down we decided to retire for the evening and climbed into each of our tents. For those who have never camped before there is an overwhelming calm that comes over the woods at night, it starts as a dull loudness of animals, insects, and woodland rodents; and over several hours this reduces to a whisper. For some this calm is the entire point of camping and for others it can be eerie. I was one of the former but I was about to have a change of heart. 

I had just drifted off to sleep when I was awoke by a noise outside of the tents. It sounded like a small animal rustling through the leaves so I didn't think much about it as I laid quietly on top of my sleeping bag. The forest noises had calmed again for a short time when the loudest thud I had ever heard came from the forest. I could tell it wasn't close to the tents and first assumed that a dead tree had fallen. I laughed to myself, pondering the old question of whether a tree makes a noise in the forest, and how lucky I was to hear it. But my whimsy was short lived as another, albeit it less than the first, loud thud came from the woods, followed by another and another. It did not sound like it was getting close to our campsite but the thuds continued. I tore out of my tent to find my friend standing outside his tent with a look of terror in his eyes. He had gotten out of his tent so quickly that he hadn't even taken the time to get dressed, was wearing his flip-flops and his lightweight fleece sleeping bag wrapped around his waist. Only afterward did I realize I had done almost the same standing there in flip-flops and my underwear.

The thuds continued steadily every 30-40 seconds but slowly reduced in volume, leading us to believe that what ever it was it was moving away from our location. After 10-15 long minutes from the moment we left the confines of our tents, the noise had faded off into nothing. Not knowing what was going to happen next we took the respite to build up a huge fire and to quickly get dressed. We sat back to back next to the huge fire, scanning the forest, and hoping that our firewood would last till morning. Being the humid August night we were drenched in sweat from the heat being thrown off the fire, but neither of us moved a muscle for hours. The noise never returned. 

When sunrise lit the sky we packed as quickly as we could and all but ran down the trail till we were at least a mile from the campsite. Neither of us spoke about what happened during the 6 mile hike back to the car. The half hour drive back to civilization was a quiet one. A few days later my friend approached me and said a single phrase, ""I just have to know ..."" Without an explanation, I knew what he meant and we begin nearly a 4 month research project. The research took us to geological events, tremors, Sasquatch, tricksters, large animals, and even one of those television prank shows. After finding nothing my friend decided that the latter was the right answer, they just couldn't air it due to him coming out of his tent sans clothes, and no one had told him yet. I agreed with him, we had a good laugh, but inside I had decided to trek back to the location to check it out. As my friend had said, ""I just have to know."" I asked a few other friends to go with me but didn't tell them why we were going, I didn't want to be the laughingstock of the trip. I simply said that I had found a cool spot to camp and wanted to share.

When we arrived at the location one of my friends, looking at the GPS, mentioned that he wanted to take a short side hike the next morning. When asked why, he told us how we were close to a gap in the rocky terrain where a Confederate Artillery Regiment attacked a small enclave of Union soliders who were protecting the gap. He joked about how he was hoping to get lucky and find a fired cannonball. My face went white and feigning illness I asked if we could leave. We headed back to the car, eventually making camp a few miles from our original campsite. That night in my tent I listened with strained ear, my heart pounding during one of the longest nights of my life. I heard only the silence of a typical night in the forest. 

I never passed on to my friend what I had been told, he'd never believe it. Im still not sure that I do, but I know what we heard that night in the woods. All I can be certain of is that I've never camped anywhere near that location again.",nosleep,abraxsis,/r/nosleep/comments/gc3ai/a_night_in_the_woods_cliche_i_know/
3,"Say what you will, this scared my family for months.",1301167730,"I apologize in advance if I didn't sum up my experience correctly but I will return later to answer any questions. Anyways,
Perhaps we are just a group of softies. Maybe we are all just scared of our own shadows, but what happened to my older sister scared everyone. 
About 2 years ago, my sister lived in a 2 story apartment (townhouse if you will). Her oldest daughter who was about 10 at the time loved taking random pictures with her moms digital camera. One night, my mother, and my younger sister were spending the night at her apartment when we heard a lot of clanging and noises coming from the walls. We ignored it thinking it was the neighbors arguing or fighting. The next morning, my niece grabbed the camera and started snapping away at herself sitting on the couch, at the tv, at her bowl of cereal, you know just nonsense stuff. When her mother was going through the pictures deleting them she noticed something in the picture of her on the couch. There was an arm wrapped around her shoulder. Not just any arm, it looked like an infant arm. She asked around to see if any of us was sitting next to her and no one came forward. No one COULD come forward because there was no one in the house except my niece and her mom. For a few days we were on edge thinking about the picture, until it happened again. This time with ME. Taking a facebook  picture, I noticed an arm poking out from behind the couch. 
During this whole time, my sister was moving out of the apartment. She was in the process of packing and taking things out of there. What really did it for us was when she was emptying her closet, all the way in the back, the carpet corner was raised a little bit. She called me over so I could lift it a bit and re-stuff it under the baseboard and lying in the corner underneath was an envelope. Inside was a developed photo of 4 babies. The photo had pins stuck through them in the shape of a cross and was covered in white powder.

My family and I recently came into some money, so we decided to take a trip to Europe and rent a room in a hotel. This was all in the summer. One night, I was in my room trying to watch TV, but there wasn't anything interesting on. Before I turned the TV off, I suddenly felt very uncomfortable and I noticed how very stuffy it was in the room and my throat was dry. I decided to go in the kitchen and get a drink. 

I was filling a cup of water and I saw something small and round looking up at me. It looked like it had red eyes staring at me. I continued to look at it with a lot of curiosity while still filling my over-filled glass of water. I was about to grab it when my mom called and I turned to face her to tell her I was getting water, then I turned back and I saw something black fly at my face and I fell on the ground. I felt myself falling and I landed on hard stone. I suddenly felt extremely cold and drafty and I stood up. 

I saw a short, fat, bald man coming up to me slowly with what looked like a fire stoker. When he was at about two feet from me, I suddenly felt my whole face drenched with cold water and my family standing above me. When I asked what happened, they said that I dropped the glass and I was screaming bloody murder for about a minute. 

We left the hotel two days later and returned to my house, but before I left, I asked about the history of the land of the hotel it was on. He said it was torture ground for like the people who didn't follow the same religion.

6,Ghost of the shop,1301163868,"My dad used to own his own auto repair shop in lower downtown Denver. Him and his mechanics were always claiming that the place was haunted by a ghost. It was generally an annoying poltergeist that would move/hide tools and parts. It usually ended up after searching for a long time or buying a replacement they would find what they were looking for EXACTLY where they left it. Another time one of the mechanics went to the bathroom, and to get there you pass a cooler with red cups. When he went to get back to work all the red cups had flown off the table and were bouncing on the ground. One thing about the shop was my dad refinished most of the building (his office and the garage mainly where customers would be) but he never touched the inventory area which was really old and creepy. One day he sent me back there to take inventory of oil and other goods. As I approached the door way a black mass shot into the doorway and stood there face to face with me. Needless to say I didn't take inventory that day. Due to financial hardships my dad ended up selling it. Years later we were talking about the ghost in here and spooking each other out. This is when my dad decided to tell us that when he originally purchased the building his landlord helped him clear some old shit to the dumpster out back. Included in this rubble; a coffin.

What the fuck /r/NoSleep - you used to be so fantastic to read from 11pm to 1am. At 1:10am you started hearing bumps in the night and had to close your browser and go to bed, only to remeber the creepy stories told be the members here.

The current trend in this subreddit is killing it. I count 14 fan-fiction stories on the frontpage of this subreddit. Shitty stories from aspiring 'writers' who just want to push their tripe down our throats.

I came here for the name, I **stayed** here for the personal accounts from other users. I've experienced my share of paranormal shit during my time living in Bolivia, others has shared similar experiences and **that** was what made me utterly terrified.

Fiction should be kept at a bare minimum here. I **have** opening a thread and ugh, ""*another one of those shitty stories. Ctrl+W*""

Mods, please save this subreddit and try to gauge the community reaction to this post. I could be alone in these feelings, who knows. Maybe the vast majority feel the same way.

To reiterate, I've been a member here since the inception. The current state it's in is a shadow of what it used to be. First person accounts of terrifying things are what makes a scary tale, scary. Fan faction should GTFO.

8,This is a true story.,1301149282,"It's interesting, I've spent 4 years on reddit and not once have found any story worth telling. Until I found r/nosleep. This story might not be the creepiest thing posted to this subbreddit, I'm a terrible writer, but It's a 100% true story.

This happened about a month ago when my older sister, Jessica decided to come home and visit the family. She's 25, I'm 23. We had a long, relaxing night with a couple of close friends. We stayed up playing Kirby Epic Yarn, talking about old times. Eventually we start discussing religion, whether there's a god. After a while we come to the subject of the paranormal. As with religion I would consider myself a serious skeptic, I try yo remain logical at all times. After Jessica finds out that I don't believe in spirits, souls, and the paranormal, she seems off put and surprised. She starts asking my how it could be possible that I'm at least not a little doubtful after way what happened to our grandmother 5 years ago. 

This isn't the main story, but it's interesting. My grandmother became very ill several years earlier, she was home on hospice. It was one of the most difficult periods of our lives. As anyone else that has had a loved on hospice, it's a heartbreaking experience. 

As my grandmother was on her death bed, my mother was holding her hand, my uncles, aunts, sisters, and cousins were standing around her as she passed. Like a bolt of lightning, the screen to her window bursts outwards, like somebody punched it, but the end of the metal frame stopped it from completely flying off. It was starling, my whole family jumped, started crying. After the funeral home came and picked up the body, my sister and mother mentioned how they believed it was her soul leaving the room. I saw it happen, while I wasn't able to rationalize what happened, I didn't assume anything spiritual. 

Since then, my mother and sister have become pretty spiritual. Not religious, but they (in my opinion) had some pretty silly beliefs. After her grilling me about what happened with our grandmother, that night we were hanging out and I remember saying. ""Jess, as strange as that was, it's nothing convincing to me. I think ghost, and spirits are a crock of shit, and I would have to see it in someway to really believe it"".

That night when I went to sleep I had a really vivid dream. My dreams have already been pretty vivid since quitting pot the month before.I had a dream I was at my favorite restaurant my family and I were planning on going to the next day. After receiving my plate of food I see a friend of mine from elementary school. Her name is Rosanna. I walked up to her and had a very short conversation. The conversation isn't important at this second, but after waking up I remember how strange it was having a dream about her since I literally haven't thought about this person since fourth grade. She was buried deep in my subconscious.

I didn't think much of it after breakfast. A few hours later we all leave to have an early dinner together. On the way my sister told me. ""Oh yea, James, I forgot to tell you"". Remember that girl you used to be friends with when we moved? (we moved when I was in the second grade.) 

Me: ""Rosanna""? Honest to goodness a chill crept down my spine. 

""Yea, her. Did you hear that she killed herself""?

""....""

Her: Are you ok? She could tell by the look on my face that something spooked me.

At that point I told her to not worry about it. I actually started to tear up. I had goosebumps all over my body. It wasn't just the fact that I found out she killed herself. It's the conversation I had with her in my dream the night before. 

""Rosanna! Hey! I haven't seen you in ages, how are things going?

""Ok, but I'm not going to be around much longer""

""Are you moving""?

""I just won't be here for long"".

9,The River Woman,1301148780,"Probably the scariest thing I've read on the interwebz in a while. Not mine, thank god. OP [here](http://paranormal.about.com/library/blstory_february05_som.htm):

My friend, Will, lives practically on the Rio Grande River, which extends from New Mexico to Texas. We both live in the city of El Paso and we have known each other since kindergarten. We enjoy four-wheeling together along the banks. One day, about 6 p.m., we were riding on his four-wheeler just along the river. We were so close we could've touched the water. As we were driving, Will looked ahead, and about 30 meters in front of us, he claimed to see a woman in a black dress climbing out of the river. Curious, we kept driving to see who it was. Just before we drove by a tree close by the bank, the figure of the strange woman in a black dress with pitch-black hair extended to her upper waist came out from behind the tree.

She looked as if she was almost sad. She was not transparent, but instead she had pale, white and wrinkly skin, like a zombie. It was as if she had climbed out of the river after one hundred years. She had many strange emotions on her face all at once. Her eyes were black and lifeless, like a doll's eyes. She was about five feet in front of us, just standing, staring at us and breathing heavily in raspy, hissing gasps. Words could not describe how petrified I was. Will was just as frightened. He had tears welling up in his eyes, frozen, unable to do anything. Frantic to get back to his house, or anywhere safe as long as it wasn't nearby the river, I whispered loudly in his ear, ""Will, let's get the hell out of here."" In one swift motion, he backed up his four-wheeler.

As he backed up, he hit a lump in the ground, similar to speed bump. I was taken by such surprise in the sudden jerk upward, I almost fell off. Half of my body was hanging off the vehicle. I remember getting a huge rush of adrenalin surge through my body. Just in my reach, there was a large stick, maybe a tree branch or a piece of firewood. I grabbed it instinctively. Will was so scared, he didn't really notice that I was hanging off of the four-wheeler. He turned his head slightly and saw that I was about to fall off. He jerked to a stop for a short as a time he could, yelling ""JOHN! GET ON!"" Still holding the stick, I swung myself back onto the four-wheeler. I looked up and saw the strange zombie-like woman walking in tiny steps, but moving very fast, towards us. Will screamed in an angry and frenzied voice, ""YAAAAAAAAAA!"" like some kind of war cry. He put the four-wheeler into first gear, and we zoomed forward. As we were about to drive by the river-woman, I let out a scream of anger and fear, and I threw the stick I grabbed at the creature as hard and strong as I could. Too scared to look back, we drove full-speed back to Will's house.

Once at the house, we told Will's two brothers about our shocking encounter. Of course, they didn't believe us. I don't blame them. That's a hard story to believe. Will and I sat in the living room for a long time discussing our experience. We were too scared to even go to bed, the memory still fresh in our minds. Eventually, sleep found us. About 4:30 a.m., Will shook me awake. His eyes were wide with fear. ""I hear a woman crying on my back porch!"" He whispered. After he finished speaking, I listened best I could. Yes, I could hear it, too. After we heard it, we stayed wide awake, not daring to drift the slightest bit off to sleep, until it was officially day-time again.

The next morning, despite how scared we were about all that happened the day before, we got back onto his four-wheeler to go investigate. To be safe this time, we brought with us a .22 revolver, and a .32 pocket pistol. We cautiously drove to the same spot where the river-woman came out. We didn't see anything that was obvious, except we found a torn piece of black material on a thorn bush at the spot where she ""climbed"" out of the river. This was so unreal, I wasn't sure if even I was going to believe it later on. After about two hours of looking around, we decided to go back to Will's house. Just before we left, Will decided to put the black cloth in his back pocket. Perhaps he wanted to prove to his brothers that he really did see it. Of course, no one would believe us. As we were driving back, right before we got off the levy of the Rio Grande, I suddenly told Will to stop. We looked into the ditch, and we saw the stick that I had thrown at the river-woman floating in the ditch right nearby Will's home. It was extremely creepy and weird. After we stared at the stick with curiosity for about five minutes, we continued on back to Will's home.

When we got back, he wanted to show his brothers the piece of cloth we had discovered to try to prove to his brothers that we weren't crazy. But as he reached for it in his right back pocket, his face suddenly turned from confident to shocked. ""Holy sh**,"" he said. I walked up to him and said, ""What is it? What's wrong?"" And he said, ""I think it's that lady's hair..."" And instead of pulling out a piece of black cloth, he pulled out a large clump of black hair. At first I just stared, then I thought to myself, ""How could that happen?"" and I felt so scared and confused, I began to cry. I hardly ever cry, so that should tell you how scared I was. I had to go back to my home that night.

When I got back to my house, Will called me. He was all alone and scared out of his pants. His brothers were at a friend's house, and his parents were out doing something. He said to me, ""I heard a woman crying at my front door, saying something in Spanish that sounded like ""mi niño!"" It sounded the same as it did the night that we heard it on my back porch!"" My mother knows lots of Spanish, having lived in the Southwest all her life, so I asked her what mi niño meant and she told me it means ""my son."" I was officially freaked out. What was going on here? Did this river-woman think that Will was her son or something?

The next weekend, I went back over to Will's. Nothing had happened so far, and we were thankful for that. That night, we invited about eight of our friends from school to have a camp-out in his backyard, which was right by the ditch we found the stick inside. As a precaution, we hid the same guns we took with us last weekend to the Rio Grande under our pillowcases. We were going to figure this out... tonight. At about 2:00 in the morning, I guess that we forgot about the river woman. We started jumping on Will's trampoline. Suddenly, we heard splashing in the ditch next to Will's house. Fear clutched everyone's heart that night. We slowly turned and saw a black figure climb out of the ditch again. We all ran inside the house, leaving our tent with all of our things, including the guns. All of us sat quiet, scared out of our wits, waiting for something else to happen. We eventually fell asleep. All except my other friend Clint, who was too scared to do anything.

I woke up at about six in the morning to find Clint staring out the window in horror. ""I-- I saw someone look through the window at me... then she walked away,"" Will, Clint and I woke our remaining five friends up and walked bravely out to our little campsite in the backyard.

We walked inside the tent to find our possessions totally trashed. There was Cheetos, Coke Cans, and Pringles sprawled out everywhere. Much to our horror, someone had taken our guns out from under our pillows, unloaded them, and left them on TOP of our pillows! We couldn't believe it. It was just too weird.

Ever since, we have not had as much of a terrifying experience with this ""woman."" But often, this river-woman still visits us. We don't believe she's trying to hurt us, maybe just looking for a friend... or perhaps, her ""niño"".",nosleep,overdosebabyblue,/r/nosleep/comments/gbxxd/the_river_woman/
10,Locked. Outside. No way in.,1301129512,"This happened to my family a couple years ago but I remember it pretty vividly. 

My mom had always believed in ghosts and spirits. From a young age she told my sister and I stories about how we have been followed by something or someone. (We have moved around Canada a lot) These ""ghosts"" never harmed us in anyway and it was nothing more then a chill on the back of your spine or that feeling that you are being watched. Juvenile, I know. However, we all fealt it in our family.  

A little back story. My sister was 14 and I would of been 13. At the time we had 5 cats and 3 dogs (mom's a vet). So night time at our house were pretty hectic. Cats and dogs going in and out of our house to do their buisiness before we locked up and went to bed for the night. My sister slept upstairs across the hall from my parents. I slept in the basement. 

One night, things didn't go so smoothly.

What I am about to tell you happened to my sister so this is going from what she told me. I was only there after it happened, but I take her word for it only because of the shear fear in her face. I have never seen anyone so scared before. 

The time was a little 3:00am and everyone was sound asleep. Cats, dog's, parents, myself and my sister. She abrubtly woke up to a cat meowing outside on our back deck. Instinctivly, as this always happens, she got out of bed to go let that cat back inside. Our back deck is only accsessed by a sliding glass door that locks from the inside.  She walks through the pitch black dining room over to the glass door which leads to the deck, slides it open and walks on the back deck and begins to call the cat. After about 2 minutes with no avail she decides to call it quites and return to her warm bed. ""The cat can spend the damn night outside"" She thinks. After turning around she notices that the door is closed. Weird, she thinks. She doesn't remember closing the door. She raises her hand and goes to slide the door open. It's locked. She's outside. With no way inside. In the dark. This would send anyone into a tailspin of cries and terror. And it did. 

At this point, I wake up hearing my sister screaming bloody murder upstairs. It was the worst thing I have ever heard.  By the time I got upstairs the lights were on and my sister was crying in the fetal position on the dining room floor. My parents were crouched over her trying to console her and ask her what happened, both being suprised and still half asleep. 

Through the tears and shaking, she blamed me for locking her outside, then my parents. As if it were some kind of sick joke. She was wrong. 

All the animals were inside that night. I did not lock the door. My parents did not lock the door on her. No one else was in the house at this time. There has still been no explanation to what happened that night. 

There has been other instances throughout the years but this one took the cake.

11,What can children see?,1301127471,"All through high school my two best friends were a couple. They had been together for so long that it was hard to think about one without the other. Then our senior year the girl Abby decided that she was going to go to the same college as me, and Allen her boyfriend decided he was not going to go to college. These decisions put a large strain on their relationship and two weeks after we all graduated high school Abby broke up with Allen. 

Allen was devastated, he had not seen this coming, even though everyone else knew this was bound to happen. Allen had thought that Abby and him would end up getting married and living their lives together. Night after night for weeks after the breakup he would call me crying asking me what he could do to make her love him again. Every night I would tell him to just move on and live his life. One night he calls and says that he had made up his mind and that him and Abby would be together forever, even if that means he had to do something drastic, then he hung up. 

I was concerned but I never thought that he would do what he did that night. He took one of his fathers handguns and he ended his life. It was a shock for myself and for Abby, for weeks afterwards we both would spend hours crying and trying to tell ourselves there was nothing more we could of done to stop him. 

Abby seemed to take the situation so much worse than I did. Allen had been my friend, but Abby had been his love for so long. As we both moved on to our college lives Abby slipped into a deep depression. She would call me in the middle of the night to tell me that she could hear Allen whispering her name or crying as she laid in her bed. I knew this was just a manifestation of the guilt she felt for leaving Allen, and I would try my hardest to make her feel like it was not her fault. 

Over the next three years I watched as my friend Abby went from the happy, vibrant girl I knew in high school to a hollow husk of a human. She never left her apartment and almost never answered her phone. When I did talk to her she would always talk about Allen and how much he must miss her and how she knew he was watching her.  

Then finally as we where both finishing our degrees, she finally met Mr. Right. Instantly she went from being a husk of a human to being the happy girl I had known many years before. A few months after graduation he proposed and a year later they were married. Ten months after their marriage they had their first daughter Alexis. For the first time in years Abby was happy and had finally forgiven herself for what had happened to Allen.

A few months ago I visited Abby and her family it was around Alexis' 4th birthday. Abby, her husband, and myself were sitting in the living room making small talk, when Alexis comes running down the hallway crying. She runs up to Abby and says ""Mommy why does unkie hate daddy so much?"". We were all flabbergasted and I said ""Sweetie I don't hate your daddy"".

12,Invasion of the Foxes?,1301121702,"We all know that the bark of a fox is one of the creepiest sounds known to man. Living in an area populated by a fair amount of foxes, I discovered this in my early teens when staying up late into the night, in the study that backs onto our large, wooded garden. 

My nightmares never involve being chased by things. On the contrary, in my dreams, I'm in my house and *something* is trying to get in. So imagine a teenage me, lying awake in bed, listening to the foxes howl outside. Since my window looks out over the front garden, I can hear, by their cries, where they are on the street. It's late summer and I'm restless, it's too hot and their squeals are ringing in my head. I hear the sound of one particular fox, getting closer to the house. Louder and louder the sound gets until it seems to be right outside our front door, travelling at some speed... and then **bam!** 

I hear the sound of the door rattling in its hinges. I bolt upright, but at the same time I know that the door held fast. The sound of the animals then recedes into the night and I lay back down, sweating and shivering at the same  time.

I shrugged the incident off at first. But then, several more times that year, I would hear the sound of a barking fox approaching and then a slam against an outer door, sometimes the back, sometimes the front. Nothing ever came of it, and it never happened again after that winter. And yet, sometimes, years afterwards, I still wonder what on earth was happening. A fox wouldn't be able to break into a house. I wouldn't have thought one would be interested in doing so. But then what on earth was occurring? Thieves testing the tensile strength of our doors under the cover of a fox running wild? Sounds implausible. What do you think?

Tl;dr version; something that sounded like a fox threw itself against the doors of my house several times one year. I have no idea what it was but it scared the crap out of me, being something right out of my nightmares.

Upon selecting “New Game”, the game started the Professor Oak speech, and it quickly became evident that the game was essentially Pokémon Red Version.

After selecting your starter, if you looked at your Pokémon, you had in addition to Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle another Pokémon — “GHOST”.

The Pokémon was level 1. It had the sprite of the Ghosts that are encountered in Lavender Tower before obtaining the Sliph Scope. It had one attack — “Curse”. I know that there is a real move named curse, but the attack did not exist in Generation 1, so it appears it was hacked in.

Defending Pokémon were unable to attack Ghost — it would only say they were too scared to move. When the move “Curse” was used in battle, the screen would cut to black. The cry of the defending Pokémon would be heard, but it was distorted, played at a much lower pitch than normal. The battle screen would then reappear, and the defending Pokémon would be gone. If used in a battle against a trainer, when the Pokéballs representing their Pokemon would appear in the corner, they would have one fewer Pokéball.

The implication was that the Pokémon died.

What’s even stranger is that after defeating a trainer and seeing “Red received $200 for winning!”, the battle commands would appear again. If you selected “Run”, the battle would end as it normally does. You could also select Curse. If you did, upon returning to the overworld, the trainer’s sprite would be gone. After leaving and reentering the area, the spot [where] the trainer had been would be replaced with a tombstone like the ones at Lavender Tower.

The move “Curse” was not usable in all instances. It would fail against Ghost Pokémon. It would also fail if it was used against trainers that you would have to face again, such as your Rival or Giovanni. It was usable in your final battle against them, however.

I figured this was the gimmick of the game, allowing you to use the previously uncapturable Ghosts. And because Curse made the game so easy, I essentially used it throughout the whole adventure.

The game changed quite a bit after defeating the Elite Four. After viewing the Hall of Fame, which consisted of Ghost and a couple of very under leveled Pokémon, the screen cut to black. A box appeared with the words “Many years later…” It then cut to Lavender Tower. An old man was standing, looking at tombstones. You then realized this man was your character.

The man moved at only half of your normal walking speed. You no longer had any Pokémon with you, not even Ghost, who up to this point had been impossible to remove from your party through depositing in the PC. The overworld was entirely empty — there were no people at all. There were still the tombstones of the trainers that you used Curse on, however.

 

You could go pretty much anywhere in the overworld at this point, though your movement was limited by the fact that you had no Pokémon to use HMs. And regardless of where you went, the music of Lavender Town continued on an infinite loop. After wandering for a while, I found that if you go through Diglett’s Cave, one of the cuttable bushes that normally blocks the path on the other side is no longer there, allowing you to advance and return to Pallet Town.

Upon entering your house and going to the exact tile where you start the game, the screen would cut to black.

Then a sprite of a Caterpie appeared. It was the replaced by a Weedle, and then a Pidgey. I soon realized, as the Pokémon progressed from Rattata to Blastoise, that these were all of the Pokémon that I had used Curse on.

After the end of my Rival’s team, a Youngster appeared, and then a Bug Catcher. These were the trainers I had Cursed.

Throughout the sequence, the Lavender Town music was playing, but it was slowly decreasing in pitch. By the time your Rival appeared on screen, it was little more than a demonic rumble.

Another cut to black. A few moments later, the battle screen suddenly appeared — your trainer sprite was now that of an old man, the same one as the one who teaches you how to catch Pokémon in Viridian City.

Ghost appeared on the other side, along with the words “GHOST wants to fight!”.

You couldn’t use items, and you had no Pokémon. If you tried to run, you couldn’t escape. The only option was “FIGHT”.

Using fight would immediately cause you to use Struggle, which didn’t affect Ghost but did chip off a bit of your own HP. When it was Ghost’s turn to attack, it would simply say “…” Eventually, when your HP reached a critical point, Ghost would finally use Curse.

The screen cut to black a final time.

Regardless of the buttons you pressed, you were permanently stuck in this black screen. At this point, the only thing you could do was turn the Game Boy off. When you played again, “NEW GAME” was the only option — the game had erased the file.

I played through this hacked game many, many times, and every time the game ended with this sequence. Several times I didn’t use Ghost at all, though he was impossible to remove from the party. In these cases, it did not show any Pokémon or trainers and simply cut to the climactic “battle with Ghost.

I’m not sure what the motives were behind the creator of this hack. It wasn’t widely distributed, so it was presumably not for monetary gain. It was very well done for a bootleg.

It seems he was trying to convey a message; though it seems I am the sole receiver of this message. I’m not entirely sure what it was — the inevitability of death? The pointlessness of it? Perhaps he was simply trying to morbidly inject death and darkness into a children’s game. Regardless, this children’s game has made me think, and it has made me cry.",nosleep,ds98,/r/nosleep/comments/gbt0x/pokemon_black_version/

16,Walking around at night,1301109375,"So I've been writing a lot of papers lately for school and have been staying quite late at the University (University of Calgary). The other night I was staying late in the library at a study carrel and decided to take a nap. I set a 30 minute alarm and go to sleep. I wake up and the floor I'm on is completely dark. I thought it might just be the motion sensors, so I stand up and wave my arms around and no lights come on.


This building is quite old, so I was thinking the power had just gone out, so I turn on the flashlight that I carry in my backpack and pack up all my stuff. As I was walking to the elevators, I felt a distant presence and heard footsteps echoing distantly away on the floor. I stop and the footsteps stop. I think to myself ""oh, cool, my imagination"". So I keep walking and I get to the elevators, one opens right away and suddenly all then lights on the floor come on, but the interior of the elevator is extremely dim. I think to myself ""ok, so the motion sensor is near the elevators, and this elevator is dim because a light bulb is out, ok"". So I get into the elevator and it stops again right on the next floor. This floor is completely dark, but a girl is waiting there. She is wearing a floor length, olive green dress and isn't even carrying a bag, which you would expect from any university student staying late in the library. Her hair is also quite long and and she doesn't seem to acknowledge that the elevator has come, I stare at her and at the last second, as the elevator doors are closing, she sticks out her arm and pushes the door back. 


Our eyes meet for a moment, but that moment is much too long when I realize that I don't see any life behind them.  She walks into the elevator and stands behind me, since I'm standing near the elevator, close to the button panel. 


I don't hear her take a breath, and I feel a coldness emanating from her, but I can't bear to look back. I get to the bottom floor, and again, all the lights are out. I walk quite briskly to the door and exit the library. Outside the library I get on the path and the university paths are completely empty, which I would expect at around 11:35pm. I dare to take a look back and I see her just opening the door to exit the library. I think to myself ""Screw it, I'm gonna run to the train station"".


So I sprint down the dark path to the train station and feel a little better now that I'm going a lot faster. I get to the train platform and look back on the path I just came. She's far behind, but her intended destination is definitely the train station, towards me. You have to climb a set of stairs to get to the train platform and she reaches the bottom of the stairs and there is not train in sight. She is very slow on the stairs, but she is getting that much closer. Suddenly, I hear the whistle of a train and there it is, I get on, and she is just getting to the top of the stairs. I go to sit down on the train, and in that moment where I walk to my seat and the train door closes, I look out the window and she is right there. Now her hair obscures her face, and she puts her hand on the window. The train pulls away from the station and I breathe the biggest sigh of relief.


The train ride to my home is 40 minutes and I couldn't seem to relax. I feel safe now, but now I'm very reluctant to study late at the university.",nosleep,Autotrappic,/r/nosleep/comments/gbqfi/walking_around_at_night/
17,Trouble sleeping,1301105967,"Last night I was having trouble sleeping. I kept falling in and out of sleep. Dreaming, waking up, thinking, falling asleep, dreaming, waking up, etc. 

It didn't help that I live in a small studio and my apartment door is just a few feet away from my bed. I could hear people coming back from bars walking in the hallway, talking and laughing loudly.

I kept having trouble sleeping. Then I had some shitty dream that sorta became a nightmare. I was tied up on a make-shift doctor bed in a dark room, and some tall, shadowy man was rummaging around the room looking for something. Then he came over the bed and in the darkness I saw the silver contour of a huge knife. I freaked out and woke up screaming.

I turned around in my bed and noticed my apartment door was wide open. ",nosleep,Nicoscope,/r/nosleep/comments/gbpj2/trouble_sleeping/

Thursday afternoon, starting around 3:30pm, maniacal laughter surrounding us.  The story continues:

With the storm intensifying, the rapid claps of thunder, the nearly continuous strobe of lighting, the deafening sound of the large rain drops falling through the trees and hitting the forest floor, and now the laughter – that insane laughter – it was getting even more difficult to keep our bearings.  The cacophony of the storm and laughter with the strobe of the lightning was extremely disorienting. Still, we tried to continue up the mountain towards where we heard the running, and now started to notice disturbed leaves on the forest floor - footprints, leading further up the mountain.

Even though we only traveled about 1000 feet, the climb up the side of the mountain was difficult at best.  Between the steep slope and the slick leaves on the forest floor, it must have taken us at least a half hour.  We probably also climbed 200 feet in elevation.

If any of you have ever been to Savage River State Forest (or any of the State Parks in the area), you'll understand just how steep the mountains around the campsites can get – often at a 45 degree or steeper incline, with lots of rocks providing obstacles to climb around.  It's not quite rock climbing, but it is not an easy hike, even in dry weather.  The difficulty of the climb is only exacerbated by the complete lack of established trails (or trails of any sort).

At the end of that leg of the climb up the mountain, we saw the fourth portal.  A large tree had fallen against a large boulder jutting out of the side of the mountain face.  This wood-fall had created a rudimentary arch.  As we saw with the previous three portals, a meat hook hung from the center.  There was an item hanging from the meat hook.  We couldn't tell quite yet what it was.

As we approached the portal, the laughter stopped abruptly.  The lack of the laughter created a strangely silent void, even with the roar of the thunderstorm. We hadn't realized just how loud the laughter had gotten.

We finally reached the portal, and realized that the item hanging from the meat hook was a pair of socks, tied together at the tops.  One sock hung lower than the other, and was covered in blood.  There was something inside.

Steve bolted towards the socks, tore them off of the meat hook and untied them. The one that was covered in blood, he turned inside out, emptying the contents into his hand.  He let out a bloodcurdling scream.

“Toes!” Steve exclaimed.

“What?  Let me see,” I replied excitedly.

Steve turned around.  Sitting in his outstretched hand were two toes, the nails painted pink.  The paint was chipping off.

Mike and I peered at the toes in Steve's hand, disgusted.  We both knew that this still was far from the worst we had already seen.  We both also had a hunch that we hadn't seen the worst yet.

“That's Sara's color.” Steve started to cry.  He started to ball up the socks and then paused.  “There's something else in here.”

More carefully, he explored the interior of the bloodied sock.  A silver [Claddagh ring](http://imgur.com/11GDU) fell into his hand. (The image is just for reference, and not the exact design – though very similar, nor the actual ring.)  A look of terror spilled over Steve's face and he slowly looked up at Mike and I.

“I... I gave that to Sara for Valentine's Day this year.  She's... never taken... never taken it off.”  Steve threw the socks to the ground.  As his gaze switched between the ring and Mike and I, it was obvious that his eyes had begun to redden, and tears were streaming down his face.  He let out a troubled howl as the tears streamed from his eyes.

Mike and I both put our hands on his shoulders, trying to console him.  “We're not going to find her alive, are we?” Steve asked.

Mike, quietly, but loud enough to be heard over the rain, said, “Steve, we will do our best.  I promise you that.  We'll find her.” He paused as Steve looked at him again through the tears. “We'll find her alive,” Mike finished.

After a brief moment of silence, the laughter came back louder than ever.  Under the laughter, we could just barely make out the shrill voice.  “You really think so?  We shall see.”  The laughter got even louder and continued for a few minutes. Then all fell silent.  It was just the sound of the thunderstorm again.

Mike leaned forward slightly, putting his arms around Mike's shoulder and mine, placing his head between ours.  “We need to find Sara soon,” he whispered.  “We need to find her before those bastards murder her.”

“We will,” I tried to assure Steve.

“What's that?” Mike asked.

Steve and I looked at Mike.  “What's what?” I asked.

“That.”  Mike pointed towards the fallen tree.  “What's carved there?”

Steve and I both looked.  Sure enough, there were words carved into the tree.  The carving looked fresh.

The words, “Look up.  Look down.  Look to life and death.  You will understand,” were carved into the tree.

“Oh shit,” I remarked.  “That's what Chris said to us after he attacked Joe”

Mike turned slowly to me.  His face had gone white.  “We've been looking up – up the side of this mountain.  Ereskigal murdered Inanna in the underworld though. That trek is downwards.  We've seen...”

“We've seen life and death.”  I started.  “Chris is fucking playing with us.”

Steve spoke up quietly, “...or he's calling out for help...”

“What?” I asked Steve

“Maybe he wants us to find him.  Maybe he wants us to stop this.”  Steve looked further up the mountain.  He had stopped crying.  “Maybe Chris isn't in control of himself.  Maybe he needs our help.  Not the murderous Chris.  The real Chris.”

“Steve, you've never even met Chr...” Mike started.

“I didn't have to,” Steve cut off Mike.  His voice was amazingly calm and collected, considering that he had been crying profusely just a few minutes before. “I just know.  He wants our help.  Think about it.  There's nobody else out here besides that Tim guy you mentioned earlier.  If Tim is dumping bodies in the woods, then he's not sane.  The three of us are the only ones that can help Chris.  He needs us.  Sara is still alive.  We can save her and stop Chris.  He wants to be stopped.”

“What are you saying?” Mike queried.

“Chris is just a pawn.  Tim is doing all of this.  He's using Chris.”  Steve looked solemnly at Mike and I.

Mike started, “You didn't see what happened before we found you.  Chris is... he has something very wrong going on.  When he spoke of Ereshkigal, he was not himself.”

“But he always came back to lucidity, right?” Steve asked.

“Well, yeah,” I said, “But...”

“Chris has mental issues.  He's being exploited.  If what is carved here is what he said to you, why else would he leave it?  He wants to be found.  He wants to be understood.”  Steve spoke with more determination and resolve than we had ever heard from him.  “Tim is the one that won't stop.  We need to stop Tim, not Chris. When we stop Tim, Chris will stop.”

Mike and I stood in stunned silence for a few moments, trying to process what Steve had just said.  While it went against everything we had previously thought, it actually made sense.

Lightning struck a tree about 100 feet away, and while the clap of thunder followed, part of the tree fell down the mountain.  That snapped us out of the quiet contemplation Steve's words sent us into.

“We need to keep moving,” I said.  “We don't have time to think any more about this.  Whoever is responsible, the important thing is that we find Sara.”

Almost in response to my statement, another scream broke the increasing darkness. It was much closer than any scream we had heard yet.  It couldn't have been more than a few hundred feet away.  Unfortunately, it came from the top of a steep rocky slope.  Looking to either side, it looked like it would take us longer to climb around than to just go straight up.

We started up the rock face.  The rocks were slick with moss, wet from the rain. It was not going to be an easy climb.  We pushed ahead anyway.  We were determined.

Steve took the lead on the climb.  For a short, wiry guy, he certainly exuded strength.  Perhaps it was determination and adrenaline that made him take the lead.

Mike and I quickly followed Steve in the climb, Mike behind Steve, and me bringing up the rear.

About a third of the way up, Mike slipped.  His left leg dropped into a crevice. He screamed in pain.

“Mike, are you okay?” I screamed up the slope.

“Yeah, I think so.  It hurts, but I don't think anything is broken.  Good thing I was wearing jeans.  That could have hurt worse.”  Mike slowed for a moment, rubbing his leg as he pulled it out of the crevice.

I looked up the slope at Mike and saw that his left pant leg was getting soaked with blood.  “Are you sure you're okay?” I queried, a hint of concern in my voice.

“I'm fine,” Mike said.  “It just hurts a bit.  I'll live.”  He continued on.

I trusted Mike, and continued up the rock face behind him.  

About ten minutes later, all three of us had gotten to the top.  The terrain seemed to level out a bit, but still went uphill.

“Keep coming.  You're close.”  The shrill voice rang out again.  “You're determined.”

“Tim, shut the fuck up!  We know it's you,”  Mike cried out.

“Ereshki...” came Tim's voice, halted abruptly.  “Ereshkigal,” came the shrill voice again, “Ereshkigal wants you to witness her triumph.”

The three of us looked at each other.  We knew the ruse had been compromised.  It had been Tim shrieking at us all along.

“Tim, we know it's you!  Just come out and lead us to Sara,” Steve screamed.

No reply.

“Tim!”  I shouted.  “We know it's you.  Shut up and come out!”

Suddenly, a shrill voice with a slightly different quality rang out.  It wasn't the one we'd heard before. “THIS IS NOT TIM!”  The voice seemed to come from all around us.

“Fuck you, Chris!” Mike shouted.

Again, the new shrill voice, “Fuck me?  Do you want to see Sara alive?  Not now.”

Again, maniacal laughter surrounded us.

Another female scream, just up ahead.  We all looked towards it, but couldn't see anything.  The laughter died down.

We continued towards the scream as the storm overhead raged on.  Lightning, thunder, heavy rain, wind.

We continued until just ahead, in the darkness, we found the fifth portal, near the crest of the mountain, just as the terrain started to slope downwards just beyond it.

Unlike the last four, this was two large, narrow boulders, clearly eroded from the crest of the mountain, leaning together, forming a low, but passable arch, about four feet high at the bottom of the center point.  As expected, in the middle, chained to the apex, was another meat hook.  A pair of jeans hung from it.  The jeans were smeared with blood and the ends of the legs had been tied shut.  

Steve, reaching the arch first, took down the jeans.  He paused before even inspecting the legs of the jeans.  “There's hair stuffed in the pockets,” Steve remarked.  “It's red, the same color as Sara's.  I think this is her hair.”  He paused. “This IS her hair!” he exclaimed.

“What's in the pant legs?” I queried, “They wouldn't be tied shut for no reason.

Steve was silent as he slowly untied the legs of the pants.  Mike and I approached closer, finally stopping when we had gotten next to Steve.

Steve managed to get the first leg untied.  As he did, something fell out with a squish.  Mike reached down to pick it up before Steve could.  It was a disembodied eyeball.  Mike quickly dropped it, screaming in horror.

Steve seemed near panic mode again.  Mike looked up at him and quickly said, “It's not Sara's.  Untie the other leg.  Don't worry about the eye.”  Mike quickly moved to block the fallen eyeball from Steve's view.

Steve untied the other leg, and a chunk of meat fell out with something metallic entangled in it.  Ignoring the chunk of meat, Steve pulled free the metallic item. It was a necklace.  As Steve held it up and stared at it, it was obvious that it was a heart-shaped locket.

Steve, all of the color draining from his face again, slowly opened the locket. “It's Sara's locket.  It was a gift from her grandmother.  These pictures inside. They're her grandparents.  She loved this necklace.”

Mike checked the piece of meat that had fallen out.  It was a human heart.  He mentioned what it was to the rest of us.  He didn't sound surprised or bothered.  I think he had finally gotten used to finding the sickening and horrific out there.

Steve looked at the heart.  A sense of panic crept over him again.  “Is that... Is that Sara's heart?”

“No,” Mike said, matter of factly.  “Remember the story of Ereshkigal.  Inanna isn't murdered until after she passes through the seventh portal and appears at Ereshkigal's throne.  From everything we've seen so far, Chris... Tim... whoever is doing this... sees Sara as Inanna.  Besides, Tim... Chris... one of them just said that they want us to see her triumph.  I assume that means her murder of Inanna.  I think we'll see Sara alive again.  We can still stop this.”

“You're right, Mike.  We need to keep on the path.  We need to find the sixth portal,” I said.  “Until we find Sara, nothing else matters.”

With all of us in agreement, we started to head further across the mountain towards the slope downwards.

Barely a moment after we started on, we nearly ran into the corpse of Jill, eviscerated, naked, and suspended on meat hooks hung from the trees.  Her entire chest had been emptied of organs, the flesh and broken ribs hanging loosely, her eyelids had been cut off, and her face had a smile slit from ear to ear.  Pinned to her pubic region was a note, soaked in blood.  It read simply, “Soon, this will be Inanna.”

**Edit:** For those asking, part 6 is coming.  I had company this weekend and was unable to continue writing.  I hope to have the next part ready in the next day or two.

19,"Extension of a ""really short tale""",1301101987,"   The room suddenly darkens as the sun sets outside the large glass window. Trophies, posters, and achievements hang along the white walls surrounding the room. Books are haphazardly left open and scattered atop the scratched wooden desk. Bed sheets and dirty clothes lie crinkled around the floor. Alone in the room sat a young teenage boy. His face illuminated by a ominous white glow. He is completely silent. He is completely still. In front of him sits three objects scattered on a table: A partially devoured dinner, an inanimate cell phone and a brightly lit computer monitor. The boy’s name is Stan and he is currently entranced in an Internet article titled “Stuff My Mom Says.” A sudden vibration from his phone causes an earthquake on table. Startled, he accidentally dips his hand in marinara sauce.

   After finishing the sentence he was on of the article he was reading, Stan stands up and heads towards the bathroom to wash his hands. The bathroom is strangely shaped like a jail cell. The walls are painted an uncanny gray. A dab of leftover toothpaste is glued on to the side of the unwashed sink. The light flickers due to overuse throughout the past month. Stan twists the stainless steel faucet showering his hands with a shattering rainstorm. He swiftly glances into the mirror in front of him and smiles sourly. Then looks down back to his hands, but not without first noticing something out of place in the mirror. His hands shake while he paints them with soap. He runs his tongue across his upper teeth. He swallows deeply. He’s uneasy. He looks back up, and once again reveals his smile. A small leaf of parsley garnish was still jammed in between his teeth . He laughs as he attempts to remove it with his tongue while still washing his hands. While laughing he hears a faint call from outside the bathroom. Stan figures it’s his imagination, but he hears it again. The voice seemed to be calling Stan’s name. Muffled behind the sound of the faucet Stan couldn’t quite make it out. He shuts the faucet off.

  “Stan!” It’s Stan’s mother downstairs.

  “Just a second mom.”

   Stan takes his time drying his hands, grabs his phone and quickly responds to the text from his secret crush.

  “Stan!” The call came again.

  “I’m working on it.” Stan ignores the call, and continues to read the article left open on his computer.

  “Stan!”

   Annoyed, Stan starts to skim through the article, rushing to finish it before he’s forced downstairs.

  ""Stan!”

  Stopping mid sentence, Stan is frustrated. “Okay! I’m coming.” He begins marching out of his room and into the hallway. It’s a long hallway. It’s dark, with the only light source from the downstairs kitchen. At the end of the hallway are the stairs. Hanging on the right wall is a painting of Stan’s deceased grandfather in his olive green WWII uniform. A dying bouquet of red roses rests on a nightstand below the painting. Directly across from the nightstand is an empty broom closet that, as a child, Stan, always feared an imaginary monster who stalked him from inside.

  Stan’s phone vibrates again from inside his room. He halts mid stride, and backtracks to his computer. There is one new message. It’s from his mother. Stan assumes she’s trying to encourage him to come downstairs and leaves the message unread. He starts trekking out of his room again.

  “Stan!” His mother calls out again from downstairs.

   Stan turns his sluggish walk into a sluggish jog. As he is jogging through the ominous, black hallway, a wrinkly hand reaches out from the broom closet, grabs Stan by the arm, and pulls him in. It’s Stan’s mother.
She whispers to him, “Don’t go down there. I heard it too.”",nosleep,wilshire005,/r/nosleep/comments/gbogc/extension_of_a_really_short_tale/
20,Scary House,1301101071,"When I was 19 I moved in temporarily with my then boyfriend and his family, back when I lived in England (am now in the US). His parents were pretty cool and so was his sisters and brother.

I soon came to find out that they shared my believe in ghosts and that they believed that the house was haunted. At the time I had experienced nothing and listened to their stories. The family beleived that the cause of the creepy goings on in the house was caused by the fact that the spirits were drawn to electricty like flies to dead flesh and at the end of the back garden there was an electricity substation. 

Before I get onto my personal experience there, here are some of the creepy stories they told me.

- The first was from his mum, who had various health problems and had recently miraculously recovered from a brain tumor leaving her doctors astounded. Her doctors had only given her weeks if not days to live and she had decided she wanted to die in peace, at home, in her own bed. One night whilst she lay there in extreme pain the wall in front of her bed disappeared and she was surrounded by a white light and she felt no pain and passed out. She went to the hospital to be scanned days later as she was getting better and the tumor had disappeared and left no trace. The doctors could not explain it and gave her a clean bill of health. She believes she was visited by a good spirit.

- His sister refused to live in the house any longer and had moved into another house down the road. The reason for this was that in her room (which was now mine) she had seen a black see through shape above the bedroom door. Like a mist, thick and black. It scared her so much she moved out.

- The family had the house blessed after a spaight of animal deaths for no reason (they kept dogs and a lot of ferrets).

Now onto my personal experience:

I was alone in the house with my boyfriends mum and we were both sat in the living room watching some tv. It was about 10am in the morning. 

At the time 3 of us in the house owned samsung flip phones that made a distinct noise when opened, that only samsungs do. 2 of those people were me and his mum and at the time both our phones were in view on the coffee table. We were happily watching tv when we heard the sound of a samsung flip phone being opened coming from the table by the window (this was not the table where our phones were). We both looked at each other, looked at our phones and saw they lights were off and went to the other table. We couldnt see another phone. We thought it odd and at this time had muted the tv.

We then heard a female childs voice as if it was coming from a phone that was unattended someowhere saying "" Mummy are you there, Mummy"". We found this itself freaking and searched high and low for another phone even looking in the yard outside the window.

About 5 mins later we hear it again and his mum asks ""where are you, are you ok"" to which from behind us (the oppisite side of the room from where we heard the phone noise and the girls voice a deep manly bellow or growl that sounded like a very angry man.

We ran out the house and did not re-enter without his dad. Who told the spirit to leave over and over. He was growled at twice whilst doing this then all was silent. His dad then said a prayer and told us that everything would be ok.

It freaked me out to say the least, I was terrified, but it doesn't end there. About 6pm later that night the whole family is sat in the living room. There are several mirrors and reflective objects on the wall. I see a black mist about the size of a rugby ball float about 6ft high across the room, but only in the reflective surfaces, it is not physically in the room. It crosses from the window to where we heard the man growl. I look round the room and see that I am not the onyl one staring at this mist, we are all seeing it. It disappears out of the last reflective surface and we see no more of it but every face in that room was white as a sheet having seen it.

21,Sink.,1301097158,"I'm not sure if this is a creepy story or anything but I guess this ""paranormal experience"" is the only interesting ""scary"" event that happened in my short life. Well to start it off, this took place when I was in Elementary school and there were rumors floating around that a kindergardener was brutally murdered in the bathroom and that Kindergarden bathroom was supposedly haunted. Many kids claimed that the last sink on the right was haunted and once turned on, you could hear a scream? (crazy I know, I was skeptical of the whole story). Of course I had to investigate so me and my friends went into the bathroom and experimented. The bathroom smelled of a musty smell and was very dirty. Anyway my friend Angel presses the right sink. Nothing happened. We assumed the rumor was fake. So we were ready to leave but as we turned we saw a little girl. A girl with red hair, no eyes, with blood everywhere. We didnt know if it was an illusion or not or we were going crazy but to this day I still see her. So we ran out of the bathroom and screamed like little girls and in the end the teachers got mad and we all got detention. :P

22,Can I Use Your Phone?,1301088756,"Alright so a few years ago in the fall, I was up late, like 3 or 4am, with my girlfriend, and my dog started barking like crazy downstairs. I turned on the lights and went down to see what was going on. I saw someone, a 20ish year old woman, standing at the door just looking through the window, not doing anything else, completely motionless. Against my best judgement, I turned on more lights and opened the door to see who she was and why she was at my door like some kind of psycho. 

As soon as I opened the door she became more animated and explained that her car had broken down on the main road and that she wanted to know if she could come in to use my phone to call for help. First of all, my house is not the ideal place to come looking for help when your car is broken down on that road, so I was immediately suspicious. She would have had to pass about 9 houses to get to mine. Second of all, she was holding a cell phone with an illuminated screen in her hand... right in front of me. 

I then pointed that out to her and she said ""oh, well... do you have jumper cables?"" I lied and said that I had no jumper cables, apologized to her and said good night. She said good night, and turned and walked away. I locked everything up, turned out the lights, and went to bed. 

The next morning I came downstairs and there was a strange ""burn"" mark where the girl had been standing the night before, and there were singed leaves along the path that she had taken when she left. The mark brushed away with a swipe of my foot. 

I'm still not sure what that was all about... someone messing with me maybe... or maybe I was under recon by a potential burglar... either way, I get chills when I think about it. Nothing similar has happened since that night.",nosleep,dred1367,/r/nosleep/comments/gbkbv/can_i_use_your_phone/
23,How many of you think every story here has a normal explanation?,1301086228,"First, I know my headline sounds like I'm a non-believer and I'm criticizing all you for believing. This is not the case, I just can't think of a better way to wording.

Second, I'm new to this subreddit and I apologize if posts like this aren't allowed. I have a few Q's I'd like to ask you guys.

I know that everything here is (according to the rules) ""true"", but there are a significant portion of them that an OP believes is true and then there are ones that are (even admittedly) complete fiction. For simplicity, I will differentiate them as ""true"" and ""fictional"" stories.

I know a huge portion of Reddit doesn't believe in ghosts and such, but I don't understand how some people can firmly believe that every single one of these stories can be attributed to something easily explainable. If you can believe in ""life"", such as you being alive right now, why is it so hard to believe that something else currently unexplainable exists? You are made of carbon, hydrogen, etc. etc...but what's special/different about the atoms that make up your body compared to the ones found in the ocean or in coal? Why do the atoms in you have ""life""?  No one can adequately explain life at all, yet it exists and you don't question it.

#1. I guess, what this all boils down to is: For those non-believers that come here only to be creeped out and never put any faith into any of these stories, do you blindly accept the fact that at least one form of ""life"" exists (you being alive)? I presume so, and if that's the case why is it so hard to for you to believe that another form of life exists (after life)?

#2. Also, is there a subreddit dedicated to ones that are true only?

#3. I am 99.999999% sure this has probably been asked before...but is there any chance that this community has interest in developing a ""nosleep true/fiction signal"", similar to [8} of /r/trees or similar?  Maybe use something like [T] and [F] for true/fiction in the post title? From the little time I've spent here, it seems like you guys are kinda on the fence about that, some of you want it some of you don't.  I think it would be a good addition.

#4. Ok, last question (related to above):  How many of you come here only to try and find/decipher ""true"" stories from fiction? That's the reason I come here, anyway. I never read the fictional ones as there's no mystery to them, since you know them instantly as being fiction. I'm not saying they are bad stories, but I can't get nearly as creeped out by something that I **know** is fiction.",nosleep,MALON,/r/nosleep/comments/gbje8/how_many_of_you_think_every_story_here_has_a/

25,Childhood Memories,1301059375,"I don't normally talk or write about my childhood ghost experiences.  I'm a terrible writer, so maybe the stories aren't even scary.  

When I was very young, my family and I lived in a quiet northern Canadian town, in a very normal looking house.  Something resided in the house with us.  

Day or night, it would occasionally make itself known.  The entity we encountered certainly wasn't evil. In actuality/supposedly, it was the ""spirit"" of a church minister who died in a car crash on his way to a funeral.  I don't have any information on the dates or facts other than word of mouth from the real estate agent to my parents.  The real estate agent actually made a pretty terrifying confession to my father about her experiences with the house.  

Everyone in my family had their own unique experiences with the entity, but we never really spoke about it until almost a decade later.  My brothers and I are actually in our 30's now, and when we talk about, it's still a very awkward conversation.

I was very young at the time of living in the house, maybe around 4 or 5 years old.  I do remember quite a bit about the layout, the weird feelings, and many events.

In one such memory, one late night I was being a big boy by using the bathroom.  As I opened the door to bathroom, I saw my father at the top of the stairs with his back to me.  He started walking slowly down them to the first floor.

I said, ""Dad, where are you going?""

My father kept walking without saying a word or even acknowledging me.  He disappeared into the darkness of lower floor.  

I continued walking back to my room.  The door to the master bedroom suddenly opened, and my mother stood in the doorway.  She asked me if I was ok.  I said yeah. 

The light was on in the master bedroom.  I peered behind my mother, and could see my father fast asleep in bed.

I was a little confused, and told my mother that I just saw my father going down stairs.  My mother panicked, waking up my father.  He jumped out of the bed, and went tearing through the house.  No one was found, and all the doors and windows were locked.

At that time, I don't think I knew what a ghost was.  I actually told my mother that a mummy once visited me in my room.

I laugh now about the mummy incident, but it was the most terrifying experience of my childhood. It took place one night in my bedroom that I shared with my brother.  I had woken up at some point during the night, and was shifting around in my bed.  I stretched my arms out over my head.  What happened next is something I'll never forget.  A hand grabbed my right hand and started shaking it rather firmly.  I remember feeling the hand's cold skin.  I moved my fingers around a bit, and could also feel something like bandages or cloth that seemed to be wrapped around the middle.

I gasped, and tugged my hand away, pulling the covers over my head.  I shut my eyes as hard as I could, held my breath and just lay as still as possible.  I never made a peep.  It was quiet.  I fell back to sleep at some point.  I always wonder what I would have seen if I opened my eyes.

Being that I'm an atheist, it's been difficult to sort out in my head what I should believe versus what has happened.  Being that I'm an avid horror fan, I feel privileged to know that there actually is some kind of quirk of nature out there, and it goes bump in the night.  That's a weird thought...

Then something crawled onto my bed. Not in the slow, creeping way it happens in movies, but the loud, bed-shaking, something-just-jumped-up-here way.  It laid on top of me, holding me down so I couldn't move.

I was on my side facing away from the door so I never saw anything. But I know it was there and I know I was awake.  I couldn't move a muscle, couldn't breathe, couldn't try to shake it off (though to be honest I wanted to keep pretending I was asleep)

Finally I heard what sounded like a little snarl and the weight lifted.  I heard feet slapping against the ground as something walked away and I'm pretty sure I passed out in fear because I don't remember anything else.

The next morning I woke up and my bedroom door was open.  I always shut it, I just can't sleep with an open door (I blame r/nosleep).

29,In the dark,1301033646,"From the found diary of a miner caught in a cave in near Durango, Co 

1st note:
It is dark. and I am alone.  I write this by the light of a candle, found on one of the dead. By the rough-hewn marks in the stone and the winding of my watch, I judge it's been seven days. The others died the day I started counting, and the Tunnel fell some time before then. If anyone ever finds this, and that's a mighty big if, but if they do, close this mine. There are things down here, things that change people. The cave-in started above us. I know there will be no rescue.

2nd note:
There is still air. It's been 9 days since I started Counting. I light the candle, and, though I do not fear death or the dead, the faces of my silent companions bear such striking expressions...I feel sure now that the cave-in was not an accident. The boss knew this tunnel was tapped out, he would lose nothing in it's destruction but an empty tunnel and five miners, and maybe...

3rd note:
11 days. Hungry. Thirsty.

4th Note
I have taken to eating the leather of my boots, it lessons the thirst but I'am dying. I light this candle fearfully now, for I swear now the dead men have changed faces, maybe even posture. The stare at me and, god their eyes! I knew three of these men in the camp, they were close to friends; working as silent agitators in the camp. In these men's faces I dream I see forgiveness, I would take solace and use the tin at my belt to join them, if it was only the three others with me.

5th note:
Forgot to wind watch, no ticking, no time. The fourth man, the dark haired one. He leers at me from the other side of our small cavern, his face does not show kindness. He moves in the dark, I see him now, sitting up where an hour ago he lay. It is because of him I do not take the morphine on my hip and end my hunger and thirst. To join him in the in between, or to leave my body with his evil is too much.

6th note:
He is closer since I last lit the candle, the light is my only protection, he does not move in light. But the candle wanes and shrinks. The dark haired man's eyes have sunken far into his yellowed head, but still they reflect the light of my small beacon like hell fire. I suddenly and foolishly imagine he is eating the flame. I don't think it will last much longer.


7th note:
God, I swear I must be mad, but still he comes closer! No matter where I move in this cavern he gains in the dark. The Candle is nearly out. I am nearly gone. Whatever the mole has in wait for me he will not wait long. I will take the morphine, whatever is to come, the right now is too much. The candle flickered. Air? No, To Deep.

Occasionally just before dropping off I see slow 'clouds' of color. Sometimes I can control the color of these clouds, making them slowly shift various colors the effect when it happens it is actually rather exciting and sometimes keeps me awake.

Tonight was different. 

They started off normal a dark blue but the cloud kept getting stronger, movement and size. Eventually I could see nothing but the cloud and I got the feeling it was overwhelming me -not physically but something different almost manic. 

If it kept going it would take my mind somehow. I jumped out of bed and switched all the lights on and it vanished.

***

What we came upon next was just odd.  Two smaller trees had been bent and lashed together, forming a rudimentary arch.  From the apex of the arch hung a single meat hook.  Hanging from the meat hook was a baseball cap with the Towson State University logo on it.

“That's Sara's hat!” Steve exclaimed.  He grabbed it and examined it.  Besides a little bit of dirt, it was clean.  Most importantly, there was no blood on it.

As Steve was examining the hat, a sudden realization came over me.  I slowly looked up at Mike, the color draining from my face.

Mike was obviously having the same revelation.  “This is the first portal,” he said quietly, almost a whisper.

I nodded. “This is not good.”

Steve looked back at us, seeing the change in our expressions.  “What's wrong?”  It seemed that he hadn't heard the brief exchange that Mike and I just had.

“I'll tell you later.  Right now, we need to push on,” I croaked out.

It was then that we heard footsteps running through the forest off in the distance, accompanied by a faint maniacal laughter.  We headed in the direction of the laughter.  If we were going to find Sara, we were going to have to try and keep on the path she took.

As we headed towards the laughter, we noticed some disturbed undergrowth and leaves, confirming that we were on the right path.

Steve slowed for a moment, looking towards the sky. “Uh guys, is it supposed to rain today?”

“I don't know.  I haven't seen a weather forecast since I've been out here,” I replied.  I looked up towards the sky.  Through the crowded tree tops, the sky had definitely turned to a shade of dark gray.  It honestly looked like thunderstorm clouds.  This was Maryland – in August.  Thunderstorms are very uncommon, though not unheard of.  At least it explained why the forest seemed darker than it should have been.  It also said that we were likely going to get wet.

It almost seemed too perfect – too much like the predictable bit in a horror film. Just as the situation gets critical, the thunderstorm starts.  I wasn't the only one that had that thought.  Mike mentioned that it seemed too unlikely to be believable.  Still, we were looking at dark gray, almost black clouds through the treetops.

Again we heard the laughter off in the distance, almost directly north.  That direction would take us right up the side of a mountain – a difficult climb, but doable.  It would, however, take us much further from any established trail.

We again headed towards the laughter.  “Chris!” I shouted.  “Stop this!”

“Not Chris,” a shrill, unfamiliar voice responded faintly from the same direction as the laughter we had heard.

After walking for another ten minutes or so, we found two more small trees that and been bent together and bound.  This one also with a meat hook hanging from the apex of the makeshift arch.  Hanging from this meathook was a gray babydoll t-shirt, marked with the logo for J. Patrick's pub in Baltimore City.

When Steve noticed it, the blood drained from his face.  He approached slowly.

“Steve, is this Sara's shirt?” Mike asked.

Steve gently took the shirt from the meat hook, fingering the fabric slowly through his hands.  He was silent for a few moments as he continued inspecting the shirt. He focused on a spot near the collar of the shirt.  He fingered some sort of stain. Even before Steve said anything, Mike and I already knew what the stain was.

Steve turned to face us and raised his hand.  On his fingers was blood.  A look of terror crept over Steve's face.  “She's hurt.  He hurt her.  We need to find her.” His statements were spoken quietly, though the emotion his face conveyed suggested that he meant to speak them louder, more of an exclamation than a whisper.

“The second portal,” Mike gasped under his breath.

Steve looked directly at Mike, “What do you mean 'the second portal'?”

“Okay, it's time I told you...”  Mike recounted the tale of Ereshkigal to Steve. Adding at the end that Chris had been seemingly obsessed with the story, and had on several recent occasions blacked out while talking about her.

The blood drained from Steve's face.  “Wait.  You mean to tell me that you think Sara has become a modern day Inanna?  She'd never willingly follow a path like this.  She'd never shed her clothes!”

“Steve, Chris has gone mad.  I'm sure that he's forcing this on her.  She's not in control.  We need to find her before things get too bad... before she ends up dead. You saw Jill.  I don't want that to happen to Sara too.”  Mike scanned the surrounding area just as the first drops of rain started to fall.

“I don't want it to happen to Sara either!  I don't want it to happen to anyone!” Steve shouted.  “We need to find Sara.”

“She went that way,” Mike stated, pointing further up the mountain.  As we all looked, footsteps had clearly disturbed the undergrowth and leaves on the forest floor.  They led up a jagged path around the large rocks dotting the side of the mountain.

We followed.  Even though it was around 3 in the afternoon, between the thick forest and the storm clouds, light levels quickly grew dim.  It was almost like twilight.  The rain started to fall harder.  A flash of lightning froze us in our tracks.  Several seconds later, the low rumble of thunder followed.  The storm was still not right overhead.  We all still found ourselves becoming more concerned for our safety, though, as being wet and in a forest was not exactly the optimal spot to be during a thunderstorm.

Another scream and more laughter.  Shit.  At least with the scream we knew Sara was still alive, at least for the time being.  None of us could even start to speculate as to how much longer she'd remain alive.  We all knew that Chris was out there, and at least one person had died.  The terror that rose in all three of us was almost too much to bear.  Had it not been for our determination to find Sara, we would have likely turned back.

Mike broke the silence we'd had for the past twenty minutes. “Is anyone else getting the feeling that we're now the cast, being led towards the next story point?”

“Now that you mention it,” I said softly, “Yes.”

Steve spoke up, “How do you think I feel?  I've been cast all along.  Until you explained what's going on with Chris, I never knew what was real and what wasn't. The tables have certainly turned, haven't they?”

The shrill voice came again.  “The tables have definitely turned.  Now, it's for real.”  It seemed to come from all around us, as if it wasn't just one voice.  It had multiple tones and different qualities.

The rain started to fall harder.

“Let's keep going,” Mike said.

We started the long and difficult hike up the side of the mountain, following the tracks left by, we assumed, Sara.

After about 20 minutes trek up the side of the mountain, another flash of lightning came, followed by a clap of thunder, much louder this time, only about a second after the lightning.  The heart of the storm was close.  The woods had fallen into darkness, just an eerie light penetrating the dense treetops.  We continued on, though.  We had to find Sara.  We had to stop Chris.

About 100 feet further up the mountain, we found...  we found Joe's body.  He had a smile carved into his face, his cheeks mutilated.  He was missing his shirt.  In his chest, framing his previous wound, a phrase had been carved: Inanna will die.

“Tim.”  Mike spoke.  “If Joe is here, then Tim is here.  What the fuck is going on?”

I bent down and closed Joe's eyes.  I looked up at Mike and Steve, “This shit is getting worse.  We need to end this.”

Another flash of lightning, and another clap of thunder, loud and almost immediately after the flash.  The heart of the storm was here.  The light had died down enough that it looked like twilight.  It was only 3:30 pm.  We were all soaked from the rain.  Even the blood on Joe's corpse had started to wash off.

“We need to find Sara NOW!” Steve shouted.

Before either Mike or I could respond, we heard the shrill voice again. “Come find her.”

“TIM!” Mike shouted.  ""Stop with the voice.  We know it's you.  Why are you doing this?”

Silence.  Only the sound of the rain and another clap of thunder was heard.  It was hard to tell from the loud sound of the rain falling on the forest floor, but I thought I could make out footsteps running away further up the mountain.

We rushed towards where we heard the footsteps.  Only a few steps away – less than 100 feet – we found the third portal.  It was identical to the last two.  Suspended from the meat hook in the middle were Sara's hiking boots, laces tied together, much like one would see shoes cast over a power line in a city.

Steve quickly snatched them down. “I bought these for her just before the shoot.” He turned the boots around in his hands, examining them.  He paused for a moment as he brought the right side of the left boot into view.  I was able to see over his shoulder the reason that he had paused.  Blood.  Droplets of blood had stained the side of the boot.

I stood silently, my gaze switched back and forth between the blood on the boot and Steve's face.

Steve's face melted from being scared into rage.  I quickly glanced towards Mike. Mike had his hand on his pocket knife, but hadn't yet drawn it.  His eyes were focused on Steve.  I glanced back towards Steve just as he yelled, “You've fucking hurt her!  I will kill you!”

Silence.

Neither Mike nor I spoke for a few moments.  Steve was breathing heavily, but otherwise silent.

Slowly, from all around us, much like the last voice we heard, laughter, building in multiple tones and with several different qualities.

35,The cornfield,1301005635,"Some people say revenge is a dish best served cold, some people say revenge is only to be taken on those that truely deserve it, I say avoid it, avoid it at all costs. 

Short back story { I lived in the middle of nowhere and had a half hour walk to school every day passed loads of fields and down some long windy lanes. I was bullied badly by a girl called Sarah in school and one day when we were 12 we both got given detention for fighting after she humiliated me in front of the whole class. }

 
By the time we'd left detention and started our walk home the sun had already started setting and the dark was closing in. We walked in silence except for the odd mumble of disapproval from Sarah, bitching at me for getting her detention. Already pissed off from the years of bullying, ready to crack from the fight earlier that day it didn't take much of her moaning to send me over the edge. As I noticed that we were walking past an old cornfield a plan formulated so quickly in my mind that I blurted out before I could stop myself, 
""did you see that?"" 

""shut up freak, don't talk to me.""

""No seriously Sarah, look.""

She turned slowly to look at what I was pointing at, the cornfield was still, and she scoffed,

""there's nothing there, shut up and keep walking or I'm going without you,""

Just as she turned away a small gust of wind moved the corn so it looked as if someone was moving through the field. 
""look, there's someone there.""

I knew she was starting to get pissed off with me, 

""So what, it's probably just the farmer""

""At this time of night, I don't think so. I think we should go and have a look.""

Sarah was getting exacerbated. She wanted to leave and I was losing her I could tell. I decided now was time to reel her in.
""Fine you leave, but I'm going in to check and see what's going on. I understand if you're too scared...""
I started to walk off, I felt her thinking it over, realising it was better to come with me than be left alone in the dark. She followed. 
I strolled boldly up to the field, my plan was simple. Get her into the field, hide from her and then jump out on her, just freak her out. Nice and easy. I'd done the hard part of getting her in there in the first place. She'd jump, get bitchy at me but it would make me feel a hell of a lot better. 

We walked into the field, the corn came to well above our heads and within a few seconds we were completely immersed, cut off from the rest of the world. I felt Sarah tense up almost immediately, I knew this would work well. 

""Maybe this wasn't a good idea,"" she was squirming now. 

""It'll be fine, unless it's ghosts or drug dealers or something."" I smiled to myself in the dark knowing I was just feeding her fears. 

I waited until we were a few more feet in, then I slowed my pace letting her take the lead, before long I'd distanced myself enough to break away from her. I stopped walking trying to stay as silent as possible, it didn't take her long to realise I wasn't there any more. 
""Amy!?"" she shouted, ""Where the fuck are you?! Stop playing tricks. If you don't come back right now I'm going to leave you in here.""

I heard the fear in her voice, she was starting to crack, just a few more minutes and she'd be really bricking it. I had to stifle a laugh to stop from giving the game away. 

I realised I could step this game up and so bent down and picked up a clod of dirt as quietly as I could. I launched it above the corn and if came down a few feet away rustling the branches as it did. The plan worked perfectly, I heard Sarah give a startled gasp. 

""Amy, fuck this shit I'm leaving now""

I heard her make her way through the corn and thought I'd better make my move now before it's too late. I waited until she was close and readied myself. Any second now... 

""Ahhh!!!"" I jumped out on her screaming as loud as I could but something wasn't right. No one was there. 

""What the fuck?"" had I just been trolled by Sarah? I had to give her credit if she had, I mean I just didn't think she was that clever. 

As I stood there wondering what the hell had just happened I heard a blood curdling scream. There was no denying it, it was Sarah and she wasn't trolling. 

I shouted for her, ran in the direction of the scream but, nothing. It was too dark to see anything any more but I couldn't hear anything either. I fumbled my way through the field, hearing my own blood pumping in my ears. 

""Sarah"" I whispered, something was telling me that shouting wasn't a good idea any more. 

I heard movement up ahead and stopped, I was about to run forward, sure that I'd found her when I heard a thud, then the laugh. 

Whatever I forget in life, that laugh will never be one of them. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end, every muscle tensed. I knew that I needed to get away. 

I ran as fast and as quietly as I could away from that laugh. I didn't know where I was any more but it didn't matter any more as long as I wasn't there. It felt like forever but finally I broke through the corn and fell onto the concrete of the road. I'd come out exactly where we'd gone in, only now, there was just me. 

I ran for home, not stopping even though I couldn't breathe. I went straight to bed, ignoring the questions of my parents hoping that waking up in the morning I'd go into class and there she'd be surrounded by all her friends laughing at me like always. 

10pm the knock on the door, the questions started.

11pm the police arrived, more questions.

11:30pm the search started, a search that wouldn't end until 2 months later in August when the body of a young girl was found bound and mutilated in a corn field. 

Living with the guilt is something you never get used to.

36,Something in the walls,1300999996,"I lived in a condo for a while with my fiance, a few months back.  It was a pretty cool place, built sometime in the sixties, and we were renting it from his parents, who bought it from an older woman.  There were various accounts on what happened to the old woman, so I can't say for sure if she's moved in with her children, or gone to a nursing home, or passed away.  Various items of hers were still in the apartment when we first saw it, but gone later.

I have always had an active imagination, and have experienced things, but nothing that ever scared or spooked me.  This is my experience at this place as I recall it, mostly in bits of pieces of weird things that happened.  I guess while I was there I was just contributing the strange feelings and events to my imagination running away.  Now, I'm starting to doubt that.

From when we very first got the place, I felt really uncomfortable being alone in it.  I'm a pretty tough woman, and don't scare easily, but something creeped me out.  I was over there doing some cleaning before we moved everything in, and I had to turn on all the lights.  I could feel something watching me as I moved around the place, I felt unwelcome there.  Not threatened, per se, but unwelcome.  

We painted, cleaned, and moved in.  Everything was fine and good, and we went on with our lives.  

The neighbors had a cat, named Rufus, who would try to get in place as much as he could, and would sit at the door meowing, then climb over the roof to the balcony and continue meowing.  We couldn't let him in because my fiance is allergic, but I would always play with him when I was outside.  If I opened the door though, he would dash in.  Every time I came home from school, he's be waiting for me in the same place, and every time I left, he'd see me off.  I thought it was cool, having a pseudo-guard cat.  We just assumed the old woman would feed him, and he was confused about where she was.  

There was a phone that was mounted into the wall.  The line had been disconnected, I just hadn't bothered to take it down and disconnect it from the wall yet.  One night it rang, and I figured it was just a telemarketer, though the silence on the other end proved otherwise.  This happened a few more times, until one day I finally removed the thing.  Nothing much happened for a while, other than hating to be alone.  

The neighbors moved a while later, taking Rufus with them.  Things started to get a little weirder.  

I started having dreams.  Dreams about the place, where I'd be in a house, or apartment, or whatever, and it was *this* place, but I'd be terrified, because I couldn't see what was there, but I could sense something.  Some...thing, in the walls.  Horribly disfigured, faceless, terrifying, lurking.  I would thrash around screaming in my sleep, or wake up with my heart pounding, the place silent.  It was always the same dream, something scratching, knocking in the walls.  I had learned that hypoglycemia can sometimes trigger nightmares, so it was another one of those things that I didn't think of too much once I got on with my day.

Also strange, how I would begin to feel so terrified for no reason if my fiance had to be elsewhere for the night.  I would sleep with all the lights on, every slight noise making my heart pound.  

The bathroom.  No matter how I scrubbed the bathroom, how many candles I burned in there, no matter what I did, it always smelled like an elderly woman.  The bathroom itself was I think what scared me the most.  I can remember being uneasy if I walked past there and the lights were off.  The door was always closed, though I never remember closing it.  I would open the door and turn on the lights, and sometimes I saw a glimpse of something moving behind the frosted glass shower doors.  But there was never anything there.  Sometimes when I went to open the bathroom cupboard I would *feel* as though something would be waiting when I opened it.  

There was one cupboard in the kitchen that was always open.  Every time I walked into the room it was open.  I would often hear noises coming from the bedroom or bathroom when no one was home.  Scratching noises.  Sometimes a putrid smell would come from the vents.  Sometimes I would find a grey hair while I was cleaning the house.  

The one thing that really did it for me was one night when my fiance was out late, and I was expecting him home.  I was in bed, with the lights on, sleeping on and off with that feeling of terror gnawing at my brain somewhere.  I woke up, and the room lights were off, but I could tell that the bathroom light was on, and I could hear the bathroom fan.  I assumed he had come home, but then I heard his key in the lock and the sound of him coming through the front door.  He asked why the bathroom light was on.

I'm in a new apartment now, since I had to move for work.  I didn't think much about what happened in the old place until I left.  I'm no longer gripped with fear when I'm alone in the new place.  I don't dream about things in the walls, and I don't feel a presence anymore.  But I never felt threatened there, only terrified, and when we went to move out, the feelings subsided, as if the place was okay with our decision to leave.  

We had a CO2 detector, and it never went off.  I also at one point realized there was an attic, or crawlspace type place.  I never went up there.  

It wasn't much, and I really did enjoy living there.  It was home to me, and really, there was never anything that felt *threatening*.  Just a bit terrifying at times.

37,Ticklefingers,1300979664,"When I was a boy, my Papa would tuck me in to bed, turn off the light and then tell me ""Now stay in bed, you hear? If you're up and about during the night, Mr. Ticklefingers will come and get you.""

Then sometimes, if I appeared too alarmed at the thought, he would grab me and tickle me and make mocking monstrous sounds as I laughed and squirmed. But when he shut the door and I lay down to sleep, his words would echo and amplify themselves in my young mind, which conjured visions of a beastly ghoul. I envisioned Mr. Ticklefingers as a stooped, ancient man, the wrinkled folds of his jowls dangling to and fro as he moved. His eyes were beady and black beneath the brim of his battered top hat and his jagged teeth were always blood-red. But it was his fingers that truly scared me and kept me still in my bed throughout the night, fingers that tapped upon his round belly as he waited for his next victim. They were long and multi-jointed, able to independently move in all directions, and once they grabbed you, you were helpless, caught in his grasp, gasping for air as he coerced your last breaths from your body with those broken, bent digits.

Such was my fear of him that I never once arose from my bed in the middle of the night. Were I to wake, I huddled up and kept my eyes closed, sure that Mr. Ticklefingers was there, in the dark in the corner of my room, his fingers patiently tap-tap-tapping upon his gut, just waiting for me to rise. I never took the chance.

As I grew older, I left behind my childhood fears for more practical worries and forgot all about Mr. Ticklefingers. I had not thought of him in years, until just last week. While I slept soundly as a child and young man, the ravages of time and poor living have taken their toll upon me in recent years. I have grown fatter and consequently have trouble sleeping, often waking many times during the night choking and wheezing.

It was on one such night last week that I arose to fix myself a glass of water. I have become so sensitive in recent years that I cannot tolerate any light whatsoever when I sleep, so my house is entirely dark, lit only by occasional moonlight creeping in through the blinds over my windows. I have learned to navigate it without turning on the lights, as doing so generally ruins my chance at falling back asleep for a short while, until my eyes adjust once more to the darkness. So I was walking down the narrow hall which leads from my bedroom to the kitchen, feeling my way, when I heard a faint tap-tap-tapping sound behind me, and for the first time in decades, Mr. Ticklefingers sprang unbidden to the forefront of my thoughts.

At first I laughed, fondly remembering my Papa, who was always kind to me. But then I remembered the visage of the gruesome spectre who so often filled the dead hours of my youthful nights with dread. I shivered as I felt for the wall and took another step, eager to slake my thirst and return to bed.

And then I realized I was still laughing.

A sudden sharp pain made me double over as I clutched at my sides, and in my mind's eye I could see his gnarled fingers moving upon me. I felt his bloody breath upon the nape of my neck as I tried to steady myself to no avail. I fell to the floor, howling with laughter and terror.

Tears streamed down my cheeks as my laughter quickened, and I felt his great weight pressing upon me, heard the pucker of his lips as he sucked the breath from my lungs. I rolled over onto my stomach and tried to crawl as his knobby fingers prodded me. I knew the light switch was but a few more feet - if I could rise and reach it, at least I could face my assailant.

With a great guffaw I heaved forward, choking and gasping as I giggled, until with one last push, I found the switch and turned on the light. Finally free of the smothering laughter, I panted, hyperventilating as I looked around at the empty hall.

I have since realized that it is much like when one tells you not to think of an elephant, and you cannot help but picture one. So it is with Mr. Ticklefingers - in my childhood, I avoided him by staying in bed, out of his reach. Later, I forgot him entirely, robbing him of the power to visit me. It was only when I remembered him that night that he struck.

Now I do not rise from bed, no matter the disturbance to my sleep. Perhaps it was all in my mind and I did it to myself, I think, an aging man giving in to delusion. It does not matter - I can no more keep him from my thoughts than I could keep from laughing in his grasp. And when I wake, snoring myself out of my slumber, there he is again, in the shadows, waiting for me to rise. I'm certain of it.

So I bid you to sleep well. And should you wake in the middle of the night or hear a strange tap-tap-tapping sound behind you, try not to think of this story.

If you do, try not to laugh. You may not be able to stop.",nosleep,ioptah,/r/nosleep/comments/gaixb/ticklefingers/
38,The Lantern: The Follow-up,1300978184,"Since a few people seemed to be interested in the last post I made ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g6ip3/the_lantern/) I decided to call up a few of the people who were with me the night it all went down. Of the four of us who were there that evening, one had changed his number so I couldn't get in touch with him, the second denied remembering anything at all. The last one ( for the sake of this post ill call him R ) though was another story entirely. He was the one that lived the closest of my friends to the cemetery, as well as the most spiritual of the group. When I had asked if he had any recollection of the night, all he said is that he could never forget what happened ""He wont let me forget"" he said. A bit unnerved, but curious all the same I asked him what he meant. R went on a long story about how shortly after I left town, he started getting bad nightmares involving that figure we saw that night. He said that after a week or so of waking up every night with the same feeling of being watched, he decided to stay up and see if there was some cause for all of his concerns. R set aside one Saturday to be the night, and prepared himself with a big pot of coffee, a good spot on his sofa, and a marathon of marx brothers. The night went on, mostly uninteresting until about half way through A Day at the Races when my friend thought he heard something outside. Before he can get out of his spot on the sofa he is hit with a massive feeling of dread, he said it felt like the wind got knocked out of him. He stood up and the moment he left the sofa it felt as though the temperature in the room dropped by 20 or more degrees. Cautiously, he made his way towards the front of his house where he decided for some reason he could not explain to look out his kitchen window, where he saw the figure, standing in front of his house in the street with its arm outstretched and a long bony white finger pointing straight at the window where my friend sat. R doesn't see him often anymore he says, but as soon as R thinks it is finally gone and over, that is when it comes back.",nosleep,khelp,/r/nosleep/comments/gaiba/the_lantern_the_followup/
39,Haunted by Hell,1300975730,"One night, I fed my brain far too many ""research chemicals"" and became utterly convinced that I had died and gone to hell. It was by far the most dreadful experience of my life. 

At first, I realized that I did not even know my own name, had no identity whatsoever. I repeated to myself what I thought it was, but the words felt hollow. Then it began to dawn on me--I had lost. Not just my name, but everything. The shit had killed me. I had lost at life, failed in the most fundamental sense possible. And there were no do-overs. I was doomed. 

They say that the word ""Satan"" means ""the accuser."" I didn't see any forked-tailed devil, but I felt the weight of accusation so deeply that even remembering it now gives me chills. Hell, for me, was not a medieval torture-chamber; it was a void of emotional, even existential agony. I felt everything that I had done wrong and was crushed under the weight of it. The regret swallowed me, and I knew--was utterly convinced--that it would have no end.  Worse still, I believed that I deserved it. Every bit of it. The desperation and despair were the most complete that I ever felt. Consciousness consisted only of this pain and one word: *awful*. I kept thinking it, screaming it into the nothingness, because that is what it was. *Awful, awful, awful, awful.* Coming up against justice so hard that it violates you. *Awful, awful, awful, awful...*

It couldn't get any worse, I was sure of that. But then, in a way, it did. The *awful* stopped, and I became aware that  there were ""bubbles"" in hell, places where the weight of damnation gave way to lifelike fantasies. I plunged down a kind of spiritual well, where I was one among many consciousnesses hurtling downward into this transitory state. I was told that people's reactions shape where they ""go"" during this intermission. Some are so filled with rage that they descend into epic wars that wage on and on. Others enter into a kind of protracted piety, making themselves believe that they can pray or serve their way out of the pit. Some elect to proceed with their lives as if they hadn't died, trying to pretend that it hadn't happened. 

Guess which role I fell into. 

The next day, I awoke and told myself that it was all a horrible dream/bad drug experience. But what I experienced was so real that it haunts me still. Sometimes, some sick part of me will start chanting the endless refrain--*awful, awful, awful, awful*--and I""ll begin to tremble.  ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/gahf2/haunted_by_hell/
40,"My ""Paranormal"" Nightmare Experience",1300974272,"I don't normally discuss this particular experience I had with many people because I'm rather skeptical of the paranormal. I'm very open minded, don't get me wrong, as I grew up I was infatuated with the paranormal but all the hoaxes and fakes I came across deflated my interest over the years. Anyway, I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while and it feels like this is the perfect place to get some insight on the events that transpired more than 10 years ago (I was about 17 or 18 at the time).

When I was younger, I used to wear a gold crucifix on a necklace. It wasn't a fancy crucifix, I bought it when I was in the Phillipines, and I wasn't overly religious either. It was just something I wore, I didn't put a whole lot of thought into it. I never took the necklace off, even when I went to bed. 

Anyway, one night I had a dream that there was someone in my dad's office typing on the keyboard. I investigated to find out who was typing... and found nobody there. Before I could take a look at what was being typed out, I woke up. 

Normally I would dismiss this as a rather ordinary nightmare, however, I had woken up in the middle of the night and my bedroom light had been turned on. Not only that, the crucifix I was wearing had been swung completely around my neck so that it was now laying on my back instead of my chest. At the time, I dismissed it as a strange coincidence and didn't think much of it.

A few nights later, I had a similar dream except the typing was now coming from the computer I keep in my own bedroom. As before, the dream ended before I could find out what was being typed out. Also as before, I had woken up in the middle of the night and my bedroom light was turned on. Again, I found my crucifix swung completely around my neck.

Within a week, the same thing happened with the typing coming from within my own bedroom once again. Unlike the previous dreams, I found out what was being typed out on the keyboard. 'D', 'E', 'M', 'O', 'N', repeatedly. I don't recall much else from the dream, everything afterwards is a blur. I have a vague recollection of someone speaking to me through our intercom system in a loud, booming voice. The only specific detail I remember quite vividly is the mention of the name Sadriel.

Once again, I woke up in the middle of the night with my bedroom light turned on and my crucifix swung completely around my neck. The third time left me a bit shaken up, and I stopped wearing the crucifix after that night. 

I did some research into the name Sadriel and I didn't really find anything significant, I found a vague reference to Sadriel being the Angel of Order but I couldn't find where that information was sourced from. Before that night, I had never heard of the name, and it was the first time a new piece of information had to come to me in the form of a dream.

Have I worn the crucifix since? Yes, I tempted fate once. I didn't dream about anything, but I did get a bad case of sleep paralysis. Since I had never suffered it before, I didn't know what was going on and I was absolutely terrified. 

Funnily enough, I couldn't bear myself to throw away the crucifix. I kept it in my wallet for a good few years after these incidents, and after that it found a permanent home in the coin-tray of my car. 

The crucifix is still sitting in my car to this day.

41,Nightmare in to reality #2,1300966413,"Hey /r/nosleep. 
A few days ago I told you about a weird experience (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g7kjo/nightmare_in_to_reality/)

I have to tell you this one.

It happened yesterday:
I'm working early (getting up at 6 am). At the end of the day I'm pretty tired, in the back of my head I blame it because of that. BUT...
Last night I got in bed around 10pm, feeling somewhat ill because of the last 7 work days were very stressful. I fell asleep pretty fast. No more then 10minutes. As I was asleep I got this ""ghost"" dream again. I can recall a few parts of it:
It was happening in my bedroom in my apartment where I currently live (from 2/17/2011). There was this dark figure staring at me from the door... It felt like minutes past for every second when suddenly ""it"" came forward and put his head next to mine... I can not recall what it said, but I jolted awake the moment it put his claw like hand on my chest. As I woke up, I felt something on my chest, like there was indeed a hand on me. Not pushing but resting. It lasted for a second. It went away, when I noticed the air in the room was much colder then it would normally be. And this is something I can not explain, even when it is cold outside and I sleep with my window open, the room temp. will never drop below 16C.(Perfect room temp to sleep in btw). Now the window was closed, and my digital thermometer was showing 13 degrees. As being tired, I just turned over and fell a sleep again. 

This morning I got up and notice my door is open wide. I know I sleep with my door open. But just 20 cm wide. I can not sleep with a fully closed door or with the door wide open. 
At that moment I recalled the events happened in the night...

I just thought: O, not this again... 

If there is anything more, I'll let you know.",nosleep,tokke,/r/nosleep/comments/gaewe/nightmare_in_to_reality_2/
42,The Lady at the Door,1300957469,"Ok some backstory first. I have been living in my house with my family of six for nearly 20 years now. Across the years I have experienced many strange going-ons, but weirdly enough none of my other 3 siblings have any encounters to share. Perhaps this explains my constant bad luck in life? Hahaha but I digress...


This story takes place when I was about 4-5 years old. At that time my father had went overseas for work and thus my mother came in to sleep with my brother and I. We 2 slept on bed frames while my mother slept on a mattress on the floor. She placed a separate mattress next to her and she told us to sleep next to her if we were feeling restless.


I woke up in the middle of one night feeling bothered. After some tossing and turning I decided to lie down on the mattress next to my mom. The night air was still, and we had the windows opened without the air-conditioned or fan turned on.


I closed my eyes, and when I next opened them I saw her.


She was standing in front of the wooden door. I remembered that she was translucent, in that I could make out some of her outlines but I could still see the door behind her. Even though there wasn't a particularly strong wind blowing, I could see her hair flowing together with her clothes ( robes I guess?). Looking back, the creepiest part, I think, was her eyes. It was a dark, hollow blackness, but I still felt that she was looking at me.


At that time I was still naive and innocent and I did not have any concept of ghosts at all. I wasn't frightened a bit, just curious, and I turned and woke up my mom and asked her:


""Who's the woman standing there?""


She woke up, looked around, and groggily said that she could see no one. My mom told me to close my eyes and check again. I did and the lady was still standing there. When I told my mother this she was genuinely freaked out. I could feel the stark fear in her voice, and she implored me to just close my eyes and not think about it. 


I did as she ordered, and as sleep took over me I felt the sensation of falling into a deep hole...


That was the only, and hopefully the last time I have seen her. Was she just a wandering ghost and could she still be roaming the hallways of my home? Sometimes, this question keeps me awake throughout the night.



I do have other stories to share and maybe I will do so in the near future...

My brother is a redditor, too, he can back me up on most things. Any experiences you want to know if anyone else has had, any thoughts on the subject, any questions on anything? I'm an open book. 

I grew up in southwestern Virginia, and the whole ground is limestone, and that is said to hold energy. The house was built in probably the 20s or 30s, and my bedroom was added on right before I was born, so nobody had lived in that part really before I got there. There was definitely more than one spirit there, in the old part of the house there were a few, and there were some in the new part. They didn't interchange. My earliest memories are going to my parents' room because I had been scared out of my room, and hurrying to fall asleep before them so I didn't see the people at night. They were like a movie, almost glowing, and they went away when I was still young, but they were replaced by intelligent hauntings. I occasionally have the odd experience now, but it's maybe 5% of what it was when I lived there. I was there from birth until I was 25. There was an easy 5 degree difference from the living room to the new hallway, and in the living room, you could feel being stared at from the hallway. It scared the living fuck out of me the entire time, although sometimes it felt as though it was protecting me, it had an energy that you did not want to piss off.

Continued from Thursday...

Mike and I approached a point near the entrance to the off-road trail leading to the B52 Bomber memorial in the State Forest.  About 1000 feet shy of the entrance to the trail, we found the cast.  It was about a mile south, assuming a route straight through the woods and over the mountains (with some very tough climbs involved – it would be much further if you were to hike the easy route), of the original cast campsites.

Just for reference, here's the map of [Savage River State Forest](http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/savageriver.html)

The crew campsite was at slot 105, and the cast campsite was at slot 100, both along the Elk Lick campsites.  Where we found the cast, thinking we had still been tracking north (but had gotten turned around towards the south), was near campsite 162, near the south end of the Poplar Lick Off Road Vehicle (ORV) trail, a trail that was unpaved, cut though rough terrain and across deep rivers, and not often traveled, save by the bravest and most ballsy of 4X4 owners.

It was about 12:30pm that we found the cast.  They were all huddled together, a small campfire shared between them.

Mike and I approached.  Slowly, almost in sequence, the eyes of the cast looked towards us.

Steve, a member of the cast spoke first.  “Jon,” he referred to me, What the hell is going on?

“Chris,” I replied.  “Chris is what's going on.  He's gone nuts.  He nearly murdered Joe.  All of you need to get out of here and go home now.  The shoot is over.”

“Wait, who's Chris?” Steve asked.

I remembered that none of the cast had ever met him.  “Chris is the director... was the director.  He's not here anymore, but I don't know if he'll stay gone.  You all need to get out of here in case he returns.”

Steve replied, “Sara is still missing.  I refuse to leave without her.”

The rest of the cast agreed to leave, all heading towards the main road, presumably to follow it back to their respective cars.  Most seemed happy to get out of the hell-hole that had begun.

I started, “Steve, you really should just go home.  You don't know what's happening out here.”

Steve was quick to reply, “I don't care what's happening.  I need to find Sara.  Fuck, Jill is missing too.  I can't leave when two people are missing.”

Trying to limit the number of us at risk from what both Mike and I felt, I replied, “Steve, you need to go home.  We'll find Sara and Jill.  Go home.”

“We know what Chris is up to,” Mike lied.  “I promise that we'll find Sara and Jill safe and sound.  Now please, go home.  Take the rest of the cast with you.  The shoot is over.”

“The shoot is really over,” I supported Mike's comment.  “Steve, it's over.  Go home.  Take the cast and go home.  If you stay here, you won't be safe.

“Won't be safe?” Steve started.  “We won't be safe?  Now I'm even more worried. Sara and Jill are still missing!”

I remembered Steve and Sara from the auditions.  They were a couple, and came together.  I could fully understand Steve's passion to find her.  I still didn't want him along – there was no need to risk anyone more than we had to.  It was stuck in my gut like a dagger that we hadn't seen the last of Chris or his violent ways.  Mike and I were already neck deep in the situation.  We didn't need anyone else to be put at such risk.

“Steve, I know you're worried.  Don't be.  Be worried about the safety of the cast. Get them home.  I promise we'll find Sara safe and sound.”  I had suddenly found some new sense of bravery and made a promise.  “Steve, you don't need to worry.  Mike and I have it under control.”  

I glanced at Mike.  His new-found resolve seemed to shine.  “Steve, just go home.  Trust in us.  I promise that Sara will be fine.  We'll find Jill too – safe.”

“No.  I'm coming with you,” Steve demanded.  “I'm not scared.  I just need to find Sara.”

“Steve, I know you love Sara.  Don't let it blind you.  We're not safe out here.  I don't want you getting hurt,” I said.

Steve stared at me, “That is exactly why I need to go with you.”  His fists clenched and his face fell into dead sincerity.  “I can protect myself.  I just need to know she's okay.”

I looked at Mike just as he looked at me.  Without speaking, our faces communicated that our thoughts were in agreement.  “Alright Steve, stay close.”

By this point, the cast had cleared out and at least found the main road.  All that were left were Steve, Mike, and myself.

“Steve, do you know if Sara and Jill fled together?  When was the last time you saw them?” I asked.

“We got here sometime last night – it must have been about four in the morning or so.  Joe was attacked at least an hour before that.  That's when we left camp,” Steve said.  “Once we got here, most of us were just tired and sat to rest.  We lit the campfire.  Sara and Jill were still here then.”

Mike asked, “When did they leave?”

“Neither of them quite settled in,” Steve started. “Sara clung to my arm, fearing that she was going to be next, whispering incoherently to herself the whole time. Jill just muttered something repeatedly.  I wasn't able to understand what she said.  She was incoherent.”

“Did either of them say anything about the name 'Ereshkigal'?  Anything like that?” I queried.

Steve turned and looked at me.  He seemed stunned.  “Ereshkigal?”

“Yes, Ereshkigal.”

Steve stuttered for a moment, and then: “Yes.  Jill mentioned it just before she fled.”  Steve paused for a moment, “Okay, she screamed it in terror before she fled.  Sara ran after her.  I called for Sara to come back, but never got an answer.  Both were gone.”

Mike asked, “Which way did they go?”

“It was so dark.  I'm not really sure.  I think they went that way.”  Steve pointed off towards the ORV trail.  A few broken and separated small plants corroborated his story.  Heading that way, they were headed further into the forest.

The three of us stared off into the forest.  We knew we needed to follow.  The three of us looked back at each other at the same moment.  We all knew the same thing.  None of us had any gear.  All of our gear was back at our home campsites.

We were faced with two choices – one of a chase and hope for survival, and the other more of a “rescue mission”, where we got our gear first, and risked losing hours in finding Sara and Jill.

“We should get our gear and supplies,” Mike started. “We don't know how long this will ta...”

A terrified female scream came from deep within the woods.  I looked towards the parking lot at the end of the ORV trail, barely visible through the trees.  It was empty, save for one car.  It looked like an older model Ford Escort – very much like Chris's car.

“Fuck the gear.  We need to go now!” I shouted, pointing towards the parking lot.

Mike immediately knew what I had been panicked by, and sprang into action as well. Steve was a little behind.  “What's wrong?”

“That's Chris's fucking car, Steve!” I yelled.  We need to go now.  That scream – it was from either Jill or Sara!  We need to go NOW!”

“Oh shit!” Steve exclaimed.  He followed us as we ran towards the scream we heard.

Now, as the author and person recollecting the tale, I feel I should mention that the site the group was headed towards was the actual crash site of a B-52 Bomber on January 13, 1964.  This particular bomber was carrying two 24 kiloton nuclear bombs.  The tail section broke off during extreme winter weather, and it crashed. The previously mentioned B-52 Memorial site was the actual site of the crash.  The nukes were removed in a “relatively intact” condition.  The Radar Bombardier died in the crash, and the navigator and tailgunner died shortly after due to exposure. [Here's the story.](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/1964_Savage_Mountain_B-52_crash)

Back to my story...

The three of us headed into the woods, towards the B-52 monument.  The scream we heard was much closer than the monument.  We wanted to find the source of the scream.  Was it Jill?  Was it Sara?  Was it something inconsequential?  We didn't know.  Spotting Chris's car really set Mike and I on edge, though.  We had to know.

We trekked through the woods for nearly an hour before hearing anything else.  We had to be at least a mile up the ORV trail, though quite to the east of it.

We heard the scream again.  It was definitely a female scream, and it was pure terror.  It was just northeast of us.  We ran in that direction.

A few moments later, we saw... fuck... we saw... indescribable.  Even as I write this, I'm having trouble describing what we saw.  Jill...  She's not with us anymore.  Jill's body... suspended... meathooks.  So much blood.  So deep in the forest.  So dead.

Give me a moment to clear my head.  I want to continue the narrative, but fuck... This still fucks my head up.  I need to go get some air before I continue.

Okay, I've gotten some air.  Jill's body.  Holy shit, I still can't describe it. Okay, I'll push through.  Suspended in the air, hanging from meat hooks, was Jill's body.  There were three meat hooks holding her up... one through each shoulder, back to front, with the points framing her face – just like the hooks in Joe's body.  The third was through the back of her neck – it never came through her face. The point of the hook must have been somewhere in her brain.

Jill was very much dead, though.  There was no denying that.

We started to cut her body down. It was about 2pm at this point.

We heard another scream.  Much further northwest.

Steve spoke: “That was Sara. I know it.”

Jill's body dropped to the forest floor.  After another exchange of glances, Mike and I knew we'd come back to it and call police later.  If we could save Sara, we would – we had to.  Just before leaving, I checked Jill's corpse – no pulse.  She was definitely dead.  Rest in peace Jill. I hope that nobody else finds her before we get back.

We rushed towards the last scream we heard.  After running through the forest for about an hour, we heard an ATV speeding past on the trail.  Perhaps we weren't as far from the trail as we thought.

We heard the scream again.  We stepped up our pace.  Even though it was only shortly after 2 in the afternoon, the day seemed to get darker and colder.

45,I DON'T believe in ghosts,1300935140,"So I don't believe in ghosts or anything and I hate scary stories, but this just happened and I thought you guys would appreciate it. Definitely not a close encounter, but this really has me on edge.


Background:
I've been living in my current house for about a year and half now. It's around 60-70 years old I think, and belonged to my landlady's mother. Mrs. Landmother was in the OSS (the CIA before it was the CIA), and it is one of a long line of perfectly cubical brick duplexes in NoVa (maybe 5 min from the Pentagon), so my guess that is was government housing for OSS types. When I first learned this I totally imagined a little subdivision full of awesome spies and stuff, but when I met my landlady, I knew that it was probably mostly paper-pusher type. Lame. Not terribly related, but my landlady has let the house go completely to shit. No insulation, slipshod repairs, so it's a drafty, creaky, sometimes creepy house.


The Weirdness:
So about a month after I moved in, I noticed that there were what looked like blood stains on the shower curtain rod. I think. I don't know for sure, obviously, but they were that dark red, and are arranged perfectly in the shape of the classic sprayed-from-an-artery wound blood splatter in slasher movies and such. The rod is up pretty high, and the stains are pretty spread out, so my overactive imagination often goes crazy when I try to think of what could have caused them.


After a month of lazily noticing them in the shower, I went to wipe them off. They're probably just from a nosebleed or mildew or something right? But as soon as I touched the moist rag to the curtain rod, it was like an arc of electricity jolted through my arm. I pulled away and immediately felt a draft of cold air and a sense of pure dread coming over me. I ran from the bathroom and used my roommate's toilet for a week.

Afterwards, whenever I even thought about cleaning that damn rod I got an ice-cold, hard-as-stone knot deep in my stomach, and, ever since, I have not so much as sprayed a rag to try to clean it. This next part I didn't even connect to this until tonight, and I know it just my brain connecting random events, and is probably just due to the fact that I'm a mid-twenties guy sharing the a bathroom with another, but bear with me. A little while after my first attempt, we started getting a red sheen on our shower curtain. I ignored it for a while and didn't think anything of it. Then I got tired of it, and totally scrubbed it down. It was back the next day. I tried again, it game right back. Ammonia spray. Bleach spray. Mold remover, fungus remover. It kept coming back. We replaced the shower curtain, but the red sheen came right back. We've replaced it twice in 18 months. I know I'm probably just a foul bachelor frog, but our grout is mildew-free, I keep our bathroom clean, but there is nothing that will get rid of this nasty tint. If you have legitimate shower-cleaning pro-tips, please share. But I swear I have thought to myself several times ""this mildew is unreal."" I didn't even think that it could possibly be related until tonight.  

The Juicy Bit:
Anyway, tonight I said to myself, ""Pullarius1, stop being such a bitch. Just clean the goddamn shower rod."" I waited until my roommates were home, I turned on all the lights on the floor, and even pointed the medicine cabinet mirror away so I couldn't have a classic see-something-in-the-mirror-turn-around-and-it's-not-there moment. I steeled myself for about five minutes and went for it. No electric shock this time, but by the time I finished it felt so cold in the bathroom and I had such a heavy sense of doom weighing me down that I just wanted to curl up into a ball in my room and cry. I threw the rag out, talked with my roomie for a few minutes to clear my head, then walked downstairs to my room. As soon as I stepped into my room, every hair on my body immediately stood on end. I flipped on the light and slowly walked into my room. Everything looked normal, but my hair would not fall flat. And then I smelled it. Blood. The iron-y, dank, thick, unmistakable smell of blood. It lingered for about five seconds, then just vanished like someone suddenly turned on a fume hood. What. The. Hell.

Again, I don't fucking believe in ghosts. But I can't help but feel like I somehow released something from the bathroom tonight,  and I hope that that whatever is somehow moves on.

I looked over my shoulder like twenty times in the span of typing this, and, of course, there's a freaking thunderstorm happening right now. But even though I KNOW there is nothing ""out to get me,"" I'm probably sleeping with the light on tonight, and staying the hell away from /r/nosleep.",nosleep,pullarius1,/r/nosleep/comments/ga7ae/i_dont_believe_in_ghosts/

I sat down and started reading at 8 pm last night , before I knew it it was 11.30pm. I have been known to sit through The Ring ,The Grudge and several other movies on my own as I am a horror/thriller fan but , every little noise in the house had me on edge!
I am not usually such a wuss but I had to leave the hall light on all night ! My SO leaves at 2 am and I don't have to be up till 7 am. Thus followed 5 hours of real nosleep !

47,"""I know you're awake.""",1300932898,"I've been lying down for hours now. It's 5:35AM and there's not much I can do. You know what the worst part about my situation is? I’m in the same room with my parents. They keep looking at me, and I can’t help but look back and try not to cry or scream. Their eyes are focused on me and their mouths are wide open. There’s the strong scent of blood and I'm paralyzed with fear.

Here’s the thing. The second that I make any hint that I’m not asleep anymore, I’m completely fucked. I will die and there’s nobody around to save me. I've been trying to think of a way out but the only idea I have is to rush for my bedroom door, run outside the front door, and scream for help, hoping any neighbors hear me. It's risky, but if I stay here, I'll surely die. He's waiting for me to wake up and see his masterpiece.

You're probably wondering what's going on. I do get ahead of myself sometimes.

About three hours ago, I heard screaming from the other side of the house. I got up and went to check on the noise and I realized that I had to use the restroom. Instead of doing the smart thing and investigating, I used the bathroom first. I could've gotten myself killed right then for my stupid actions. But I actually did my business and took a peek outside the bathroom. There was blood on the carpet. I got very worried and ran back to my room and hid under my sheets like the pussy I was. I tried to convince myself to go back to sleep, that it was just some really vivid dream or something.

I heard my bedroom door open. Like the terrified child I was, I peeked from under my blankets to see what was going on, I could see something dragging my dead parents into the room. Whatever it was, it wasn't human, I can tell you that. It was hairless, with no eyes, and no clothing. It walked like a caveman, with its back slouched as it dragged my parents. But this thing was much smarter than any caveman. It was aware of what it was doing.

It propped my dad up on the edge of my bed, and made him face me. Then, it sat my mother down in the chair and positioned her towards me as well. After that it started rubbing its hands on the walls, staining them with blood, and then drew a circle with a pentagram in it. To finish it off, it scribbled a message on the wall that I couldn't read in the darkness.

It then positioned itself under my bed, waiting to strike.

The scariest thing is now, my eyes have adjusted to the darkness since then and I can read the message on the wall. I don't want to look at it, because it's terrifying to think about. But I feel the need to see, before I'm killed.

I peek at the creature's masterpiece.

48,Have you ever felt that your house was out to get you?,1300930561,"Seriously. I live in this old row home in Philly and it's terrifying. The house had been unoccupied for years, something our landlord failed to mention. So, due to operation codes and standards, the electric and gas companies could not supply our utilities until they had inspected the house. We spent the first week there sans electricity in the middle of the summer.

The first thing I noticed were the vents. They're old and ornate and pop right out from the walls. I swear I still expect to see eyes in the darnkness, or long fingers blindly feeling their way out into my house. The worst vent is right by the toilet. It's at neck level when you're sitting down, and you have to reach past it to flush. I've been living in this house for nearly a year and I'm still afraid of it.

Then I started feeling like there were things crawling on me, at all times. I started to itch and lose sleep. I had no marks of any kind though, and the doctors only said it was anxiety. I feel things crawling on me all the time now, but there's never anything there.

We have to keep the basement door open so my cat can get to the litter box. Any time I go downstairs, I am over whelmed with fear. It's not only at night. It can be early morning, afternoon, any time of day. I'm scared shitless to be in this house. I've started hearing voices, and I feel like I'm being watched at all times. Any time I go upstairs, I feel something chasing me so I start to run. I don't feel any safer in my room.

The other day, I was home alone. Both of my room mates' bed room doors were closed, as always, because my cat is a bastard and eats wires. I stood up to go downstairs to get a snack. As I neared the exit to my room, I heard a door close. It didn't slam, it just..closed. The only doors it could have been were the bathroom door and the basement door. After working up a lot of courage, I went to investigate. Neither the bathroom nor the basement door were closed. The cat was in my room the whole time.

I realize none of these events are totally horrific, but I do feel that the house is working against my sanity.",nosleep,phillyspooks,/r/nosleep/comments/ga5oq/have_you_ever_felt_that_your_house_was_out_to_get/

Me:  hahahahaha nice

[I’ll be honest, this has actually been an exciting week for me going from vague memory to full blown detective mode, but it’s been pretty fun figuring this out even if it still gives me the creeps a little.]

50,I have a history of paranormal activity.,1300920908,"I know that the policy for NoSleep is to assume that everything you read here is true.  Problem is, what I'm writing about, really did happen.  It's been happening to my family and I for years.  I've had other stuff happen to me when I was younger, and my family has as well.  Maybe it's a genetic thing, I don't know for sure.  It's happened to my mom, her sisters, and their children, too.  I can comment on those later if you guys would like, but for now, I'll focus on what's happened to me and my family in the recent past.  

If you don't believe it, that's fine.  Some of this stuff is simple and harmless, some of it is pretty freaky.  None of it I would believe unless it had happened to me, so no offense taken.  My wife and our friends didn't believe it, either.  Then random, bizarre shit happened to them, too.  

Ok, background:

At the time this happened (late 2004 / early 2005), my wife still worked three nights during the week as a nurse.  This meant that occasionally, I'd be at home alone, with nothing to do but knock back a few drinks, play video games, and generally act like a bachelor.  We live in a suburb away from town, so not much happens later on in the evening.  Anyway, that's the gist of the setting where this takes place; modern suburbia in a medium-sized town in the deep south.  

Event:

It was a normal night during the week when I was home alone.  It wasn't too late, probably around 10pm or 10:30pm at the latest.  I had drained a couple rum and cokes, and was feeling pretty loose.  Not hammered at all or even tipsy...just loosened up, and really starting to unwind and relax.  I played Xbox for a while, had a couple more drinks, and felt a call of nature.  

I went to the master bathroom in our house, and did my business.  From where I was sitting, at a 45 degree angle to my left is a window outside.  It's not a regular window, it's one of those wavy kinds that distorts and blurs what's on the other side, no matter if you're looking inside from the outside or vice versa.  The window is fairly large, around 4 feet wide by 3 feet high.  It's about 4 feet off the ground if you're outside.  

I was starting to get tired, and leaned my head on my hands and letting my eyelids droop for a few seconds.  It was nice and quiet in the house, with no sounds, not even from our two cats.  I looked up, noticing motion in the window.  Sometimes when a car is coming down the street, the flare from the headlights will catch in the window for a couple seconds, going from right to left as it drives by our house.  But it will travel in a straight line, which this did *not*.  

It looked like a white light, roughly the size of a canteloupe or mini-basketball.  It went in a wavy motion, up and down, slowly from the right of the window to the left side.  It moved at a constant speed, never slowing or accelerating, never flickering, and never higher or lower for each time it went up or down than before.  It had a calm, even pace to it, not fast, but almost casual.

I shook my head and blinked my eyes, thinking that maybe the drinks had gone to my head more than I thought, or that my contact lenses were getting dry and blurring my vision.  Much to my dismay, the world was very sharply focused, and the light had not stopped moving.  It kept going until it went past my field of view through the window.  

I finished my business and went out to the backyard, the direction the light had seemed to be heading.  As you might have guessed, there was nothing there.  I checked the front yard, and there wasn't anything there either.  I came back inside and went back in the bathroom to check the window, and saw nothing else.  Eventually a car did drive by again, and I confirmed that it looked nothing like what I'd seen earlier.  

Every time I am alone in the house at night, and walk by that window, I can't look at it or the mirror across from it.  Still creeps me out.

As I stated above, this was not the last time weird shit happened in our home.  This was only the beginning.

PS:  This is my first post.  Please be gentle.



Edit:  It's late, I'll post more tomorrow.  Thanks for following this, Reddit.  It's been good and bad for me.  Good in that I've been able to vent some of the more paranormal parts of my life to open ears.  Bad in that it dredges up memories that, until recently, I had kept down.

52,I shouldn't have sat down,1300910533,"My friend Roger was always going on about how his house was probably haunted. Every other week there was some new noise or shadow to tell about. After a while, I was either curious enough or tired of hearing about it, so I asked if I could spend the night. He agreed, hoping to make a believer out of me. His family was going away for the weekend and he needed someone to house-sit.

I came over that Friday morning, and he gave me a tour of the house, making sure to include areas where the hauntings had occurred, and to pour on the lavish detail of how ghostly it was, how chilly the air could become, and where the flashlights, light switches and circuit breakers were in case I got ""creeped out."" I just shook my head most of the way, rolling my eyes when he described anything too outlandish. ""I'll be fine,"" I said. ""Just enjoy your weekend."" I stood at the doorway and waved him and his family off as they piled into their sedan and drove off.

I'm a bit of a lazy guy, so I didn't do much that night beyond eat a few snacks out of the pantry and consume most the the soda in the house. I spent a good portion of the night surfing the web on their ancient desktop with a CRT. It was so bright I didn't really notice when the sun went down, and I had turned on no lights. I finally got up from the desk and stretched, my joints and muscles stiff from being in the same position so long, and my leg had fell asleep. I hopped around until the tingling sensation went away.

I noticed the time--eleven o'clock. It had gotten late fast, or I spent too much time on the Internet. Either way, a favorite show of mine was on, so I ambled over to the couch and plopped down in the middle of it. I even let a big fart down into the cushions--now it was mine.

I fumbled around for the remote on the arm of the couch and turned the TV on. He lived in a different area than me so I spent some time going through the guide trying to figure out what channel my show was on. Just as I found it, a pair of hands grabbed both of my shoulders. I jumped, but started laughing, figuring my friend had given his neighbor a key to scare me or something. I turned around and stopped laughing.

There wasn't anyone there, at least anything you could call human. It was a pair of arms so black they were not any human skin color, and they could have been shadows themselves. They extended straight from the wall as though it were alive, and started pulling hard on me. I tried twisting my way out of their grip first--they were far too strong. I started pulling on the fingers and bashing the hands with my fists. The touch made my skin crawl--it was some slimy cold, like you might think an alien or amphibian's touch would be.

I lost my grip on the couch and was vaulted into the air towards the wall. I had nothing to grab onto, and saw the room I was in disappear before my eyes. I could barely breathe because of the pressure on my body. At first it was black, but I began to make out where I was. I was able to make out beams of wood, drywall and insulation. I was actually inside the wall itself. I tried to beat my way out, but there wasn't enough room to move my arms.

I passed in and out of consciousness as time passed. I was starving so badly my stomach caved in on itself, and my mouth was dry as dust. I figured I was going to die inside the walls of this house, never to be heard from again.

I heard voices. I thought they were hallucinations, but then I heard my name. It was Roger's voice. I could hear the voices of the family too. They were home!

I called out several times. Roger began running around the house trying to find me. He must have realized I was in the wall because I heard sirens a few minutes later. There was the sound of diesel engines and men walking around with heavy equipment. In the near total darkness, I began hearing loud banging and thuds against the wall. Chinks of light began to pour into the wall space, and suddenly the drywall gave way and I tumbled onto the floor in a heap, gasping. The light seared my eyes--I could only make out hazy figures. I was picked up and taken to the hospital.

To this day Roger thinks I risked my life to pull an elaborate prank. He tried suing me for the damage to his house, and the police investigated him a long time for having me in the wall in the first place. We don't speak anymore, and I won't ever even go near his town. But he did get what he wanted--he made a believer out of me.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g9y66/i_shouldnt_have_sat_down/
53,Really short tale,1300907758,"You may have have heard this one before, but is one of my favorites.

A young girl is playing in her bedroom when she hears her mother call to her from the kitchen, so she runs downstairs to meet her mother.

As she's running through the hallway, the door to the cupboard under the stairs opens, and a hand reaches out and pulls her in. It's her mother. She whispers to the child,

54,The old blue house.,1300907453,"
The events told in this story happened before my birth. But knowing my family, where it happened and some small events that happened to myself, I doubt none of it. 
 
Everything happened in a remote fishing/farming town. The population is barely 400. Not a lot of people moved away. Children usually stayed with their parents until they pass away or move to the house beside the parents’. Houses were kept in the family and were rarely sold. 
 
One night my mother was walking back home from a friend and realized the lights of the house next door (an old and unusual blue colored house) were all on. Attic to basement. At this point, nobody lived in this house. Her father mostly used it as a tool and log shed. Probably he was looking for something and forgot to close the lights, she thought. Once at home, she told him about the lights and he said he did not go there that day. She asked him who could have went nut her father just shrugged and simply said “It must be uncle Harold.” Uncle Harold was the one who previously lived in the blue house. The problem was that uncle Harold passed away years ago and grandpa knew that. 
 
Still, every time something unusual happened in the blue house, grandpa kept saying it was just uncle Harold and slowly the whole family said the same thing. Nobody in the family saw it as a threat. 
 
Some years later her older brother decided to move into the blue house. He made it livable, loved and brought girls over of course. He was popular but he could not keep a relationship for long. The problem was not him. It was uncle Harold. One girl would break up after trying to find the salt shaker that, for some reason, ended being on top of the pantry. One would hear a noise, go downstairs and see that the chairs in the dinning room would have been moved around. One woke him up, screaming that she saw a man inside. She described him and said he had a bowler hat. Uncle Harold was known in the town for his bowler hat. She left the next day. 
 
One night, single this time, the older brother was sleeping in his bed. He was used to all the sounds common in older houses. What woke him up was what seemed like a light pulling on his sheets. He ignored it but it slowly became stronger. This did not scare him. It angered him. He pulled the string above his bed to open the light and was not surprise to see he was alone in the room. He started yelling alone “Alright! You want the bed? You can have it! I will sleep downstairs!” He stormed down the steps and laid down on the couch. One the ceiling, he could see the light he forgot to turn off  in his bedroom through the vent. “Goodnight!” he said loudly. The light in his bedroom turned off. 
 
Even after this, he never moved away.  
 
Around 2004, he won a good sum on the lottery and completely renovated the house. After that, he did say that he did not feel uncle Harold around much. The family agreed that uncle Harold only wanted his house to be fixed.
This might not be a nosleep worthy story, but even before I heard of those stories, I never was able to sleep in the old blue house.",nosleep,tophatduck,/r/nosleep/comments/g9wza/the_old_blue_house/
55,The Girl in the Window,1300892270,"This isn't exactly the normal thing you find in /nosleep...its not really scary.  However the content is appropriate and I wanted to share an experience I had some years ago.  

My mom has always had a (we'll call it affinity) affinity for things that most people try to not think are real, things most will make up reasons to debunk.  Things like ghosts, demons, hauntings, curses,  etc.  Even her constant curiousity has never brought anything negative on us and judging by some of the horror stories I've heard and read from her books of those who ""dabble"" in the research or thoughtcraft she does...I am kind of happy.

I tell you that, to set up for this part.  As per most cases where a family member takes interest in something, so will another.  I also found myself reading her books and doing the research online, mostly out of morbid curiousity.  Most things I found I met with a shroud of disbelief...most things I found seemed like they were trying to hard to be convincing.  The ones I found believeable or plausable were usually the stories or accounts that were simple.  Granted there are tons of documentations on some of the overly complex cases to try to prove its authenticity, but to me at least I always was under the impression that if you tried hard enough you can get verification from somewhere to confirm your story...but thats all beside the point.

Now then, on to my story.  With that brief background, it is no surprise that when visiting Savannah, GA on a family vacation that my mother wanted to take the haunted tour of the town.  If any of you have been to Savannah you know that there are several tours like this, so which one in particular it was I have no clue, to be honest I think my mom just picked one at random.  Well about 7pm or so we all meet up at the park where the tour guide was meeting the group.  There was about 10 of us in all (3 of us being my family).  The tour, despite the description in the brocure my mom had picked up from the hotel, was very corny and lackluster.  Graveyard stories here, haunted hospital and old townhome stories there...mostly all of it seemed very, well fake...and I found myself almost asleep while standing for most of it. 

After about an hour of this ""tour"" we were nearing the end and came to this old two storie house in the heart of town.  Out of the ordinary from the rest of the tour we couldn't go inside this house and take a peek, which was odd because we got to peek inside everything else, and I assumed it was because it was the end of the tour and our ""guide"" was ready to go hit the Jack Daniels.  As we approached the house he began his long diatribe about the family that lived there, how they met their end, and that some say you can still see the daughter looking out her window.  To be honest, I didn't really even listen to to him and was fixated at the figure standing in the upstairs window.  I never heard the story about how they died, I never heard that some say she's still up there, all of that I had to pick up after...I was actually so fixated on that girl up in that window that I didn't even think anything was out of the ordinary.  I looked ahead to grab my mom and asked why she got to go inside and we didnt (in my mind I guess I was thinking it was another tour).  My mom only could ask me who I meant, and when I pointed up to the window, she was gone.  

I later asked if another tour could have been in there and it clearly wasn't possible...the door to the house was not only boarded shut, locked, and had a chain around the handles...but the whole house was sectioned off as a historic site...no one is allowed in.

I am normally not the one to claim ""I saw the ghost"", but clear as day in that window not 5 seconds earlier...there was some girl standing there.  

I know its not scary, I know its not startling and probably won't keep you up at night, but I know I saw that girl there.",nosleep,hiimdave,/r/nosleep/comments/g9qqd/the_girl_in_the_window/
56,The Valley of the Shadow of Death,1300860809,"I don't really ever come here to /nosleep/ but my buddy said you guys would enjoy my story. I insist that every word is true but you can choose to believe me or not. I will answer any questions. 

-

It all started when I was eight. I (the youngest of 4 boys) slept in the same room as my brother closest to me in age. One night during a time when my family was in particular disarray, I peered around my room and my eyes feel on a dark figure sitting on my dresser. a long black cloak and tendril-like fingers wrapped around the edge. I was scared, but didnt think much of it, and went to sleep. 

Over the next few years I saw it pretty frequently, always across from me, always staring at me. 
this continued until my brother assumed the room downstairs and I finally got the room to myself. I still saw the figure, but now it would advance to sit on the side of my bed. I laid in such fear as I felt my bed sink beside me, Stop! And it would go away, but always to come back multiple times until I fell asleep. Again, I didnt really think anything of all this, and went about life normal.

This last year, It got bad, really bad. In the early days, I would have to see it no know it was there. But now before I even saw it, I would be seized by agitation, anger, fear, anxiety, and my mind would be filled with horrible, sickening images. During one of these nights my brother burst into the room at 2:00 saying he just had terrible thoughts followed by a vision of fearful green eyes (I have green eyes). He asked if it was in my room, which of course it had been.

I started to lose my ability to sleep, I would run to my bed when I turned off the lights and just couldnt take the dark anymore. 

Entering my seventeenth year I started to realize that it wasn't normal. The looming, menacing figure. Always staring, sitting next to me (not on top, it wasn't sleep paralysis) and screaming at me. The horrible sickening fear (I was one of the most physically powerful kids I had ever met, what was WRONG with me?!)
Side note: If you've ever heard things, you know how tormenting it can be.

-

So one day I decided it was enough. My brother and my mom and I prayed in my room. And I honestly think it was my brother, screaming at the top of his lungs ""GET OUT!"" that forced it out forever. I have never seen, felt, or heard it since. I am completely free. I am 7 months free.
Believe me or not, I have never seen a trace of it again. my fear of the dark is going away. and I can sleep again. Thats my story. If you made it this far, good karma to you sir or madam. 

....

But I still hear the voices at night. The voices I have heard since before that thing. Always whispering, always angry, aways arguing. Never stopping. I don't know what they are.

57,this was the last time I screwed around with EVP,1300859685,"Me and my brother had read a bit on electronic voice phenomenon.  It was pre-internet days and we were very curious about it.  We lived with our parents up in a north western city in Georgia.

We had lost a young friend to cancer years ago.  As it was our first brush with death, we decided we would try to contact him.  We toyed around with a dictaphone for a few weeks, to no avail.

One night, after leaving the dictaphone on in my (thankfully for me) brother's room, we asked by name if we could talk to him.

My brother, having previously reviewed the recordings came into the room with a really serious look on his face.  He re-winded the tape, which was audible as it tracked back.  I could already notice the ""blips"" in the otherwise white noise.  

I'll be honest, it took me awhile to understand what I was hearing, but once I did it was very, very creepy.  It was a low pitched voice, it said I'm (the kids name).  30 or so seconds later it said it again, but with more emphasis.  This kid had a lot of syllables in his last name so it was pretty hard to miss, and the fact it had been repeated twice made it even more weird.

After that, another voice popped up, the more traditional type from people experimenting with evp.  It sounded like it was coming through a fan.  But it said, ""No he's not, he's really bad, don't believe that.""  And then there was a knock, or something that sounded like that and that was it.  It kinda sounded like somebody tapped the microphone.

After the fact I heard breathing in the room the entire rest of the time I lived there.  I would tell myself it was my dad in the other room but who knows.  A little drug use was involved so I can't validate this portion of my account.

We've never talked about it since, and he's now really religious.  I've come to believe there is definitely a side to reality we cannot see, and I can never explain that experience.  I've listened to a lot of evp recordings on the nets but I've never listened to one that has duplicated that type of voice that claimed to be our dead friend.",nosleep,fawker,/r/nosleep/comments/g9ih4/this_was_the_last_time_i_screwed_around_with_evp/
58,The Confessions of a Psychic Part 3: The Old House,1300858461,"Before we get started, I just want to say that this a much longer story than the others so far, and I am starting to wonder if I should start having her tell her story in her own voice by recorder and post it somewhere and share it here, along with a written version.

I find that she tells her stories the best in person, and recording her voice is the next best thing. Please let me know what you think of my idea, and I'll see when we can try this out.

I hope you all enjoy this story, it involves multiple visions and ghosts, so sorry if some things may be a bit confusing. As I said, she tells it a lot better in person.

The following story is that of my moms experience of being a psychic. I have convinced her to let me share some of her experiences with other people by having her write them down, and letting me post them here. I would also like to remind you all that English isn't her first language, so her writing isn't the best, but I cleaned it up the best I could without changing too much.

This is her story.

""I think it was sometime in 1999, my son and I were invited to spend a long weekend at my friends old house. Her house was about 105 years old and it definitely showed. It felt like it when I first walked in. As soon as I was through the door there were so many voices coming at me, I was overwhelmed by all these voices and questions, so I asked my friend to show me the trailer out back just so I could get out of the house. So we went out back and all these voices just stopped.

She had a brand new trailer and it was beautiful inside, and quiet. I got our bags and pillows out of the car, and as I walked pass the house I was this little girl and her mother in the upstairs window. They looked like they were dressed from the early 1930’s. I looked at my friend when she asked if something was wrong, I said no, and as I looked back up they were gone.

I told her that I was going to rest for a while, just so I didn’t have to go back in that house right away. First thing I did was light a white candle so I could compose myself and try to understand what was happening in that house. There were a lot of voices and questions that all needed my help.

So at supper time I went in and it started, so I excused myself and went to the washroom upstairs so I could try and talk to them. First I had to tell them to be quiet or I would go home, then I asked for the woman to speak. She asked me where her husband was, and I asked her what happened for them to be separated. She said that there was a fire at night and she tried to wake him up but had to go get her daughter out of the house. But they couldn’t get out because the stairs were on fire.

So her and her daughter died that night, but she never found her husband. So I asked if the spirit of a man who died in the fire was here with us. I got no response but then I got a vision of that night. I saw the lady and her daughter die in the upstairs hallway, and then I saw the husband on the bed. Then I saw a flash of a fireman and ambulance and then to the hospital, where he later died, and moved on. Back to the preset, I told them what happened to her husband, and they just disappeared. 

I went back downstairs to eat and then we all went to the fair for the evening. But it bothered me all that evening, as if I needed more answers. So once we were back at the house, I asked my friend if she knew some of the history of the house. She knew about a family that burned in the 1930’s, and that the upstairs of the house was rebuilt.

Then I asked her if there was a murder suicide back in the 1970’s in the kitchen we were sitting in. All of a sudden she goes white on me and her eyes almost popped out of her head. 

“How did you know about that?” She asked.

All I told her was that I could feel it and saw it happen. She then asks me if I’m psychic, and I told her that I was and that I would tell her more after a good night sleep.

Once in the trailer, I put my son to bed then sat at the table looking out of the window. It was about 2:00am when I saw the lady and her daughter in the window again, this time they looked sad. I sat there with my candle, just staring out the window for another hour or so. I finally made it to bed around 4:00am.

I had a dream about what happened in that house but also a dream about my friend’s father that used to live down the street about five houses across the road. I heard a noise outside, so I looked at the time and it was already 11:00am. My son and her five kids were playing outside. I got up, made my bed, got dressed, and then went in for a coffee. We made the kids sandwiches and ate outside so we could have peace before we left for the fair again. There was a truck and tractor pull that I wanted to see.

Around 8:00pm we decided to go back to the house, we setup the kids in the living room with drinks, popcorn, and a movie so we could talk privately. I started with what are we planning for tomorrow, to I need to ask you something about your father. She asks me why, and I tell her again that I am psychic, and there is something I saw about her father. She told me to go right ahead, and she would listen without a word, I started.

I asked her if her father lived across the road about 5-6 houses up the street, she said yes. Okay I said, he lived upstairs in a small room right? She nodded. I then went on to describing the room he stayed in. A small single bed by the wall next to the window, a wooden chair in the corner by the bed, and a small dresser at the end of the bed. She nodded again. I told her that her father used to sit on the side of the bed and have a smoke all the time, but one night while he was having his smoke he fell asleep.

She started to tear up, and tears went down her cheeks, I told her I could stop, I know how hard this is. She said no, go ahead and finish, so I continued. I told her that her father fell asleep with a lit cigarette in his right hand and fell into the bed. The mattress caught fire, and her father burned to death.

She was shocked, she said that no one has told anyone how he died, people just thought he was just stuck in his room and died, and no one knows the real story. I told her that I know, and asked her if she knew that her father had started to take sleeping pills a few days prior to his death, and she said yes, she knew. I let her cry for a while, and I cried with her.

Then I asked her if she believed in my powers now, and she said yes, why? I told her that there were ghosts here, but they were good ghosts, nothing to be afraid of. She said she had a feeling because one of her kids is always talking to someone at the top of the stairs. I told her that he’s talking to a little girl, but it will pass when he gets older. By the time we finished talking, all of the kids were sleeping on the floor in the living room. So I grabbed my son and went to the trailer.

That night I sat at the table looking out the window at her house again. I still saw the woman and her daughter looking out the window. I guess this is something they have been doing since the 1930’s. I thought that being able to see ghost like I was seeing was amazing.""

Thank you all for reading. Again, please let me know if you think if it's a good idea or not for her to record her stories. Perhaps we could do some sort of Q&amp;A at one point, and I can record her answering questions as well.

  I sat at the kitchen table drinking coffee. Dawn sun filtered in through the windows set over the sink, highlighting the tired mug cupped in his hands. My wife had bought it for me years ago, the words faded to the point where all that you could read now was the word ‘Best’. I took a deep drink and felt the heat pulse through my body. It had been chilly last night and I felt for the grapes, if there was luck about maybe it’d rain this afternoon. I drained the cup and carried it to the sink softly, unwilling to break the quiet of morning. If the Army taught me anything it was always to savor the sunrise. Andrew plodded softly down the stairs, coughing the whole while. 

“Could you be any louder?” I chuckled as I opened the refrigerator.

“I wouldn’t if there was the sweet aroma of breakfast to cushion my morning.” He griped.

“All you ever do is complain anyway. Omelets or straight eggs?”

“Straight. They need me up there early today.”

“Drug bust?” I cracked the eggs into the pan with a satisfying sizzle.

“The mayor’s calling a meeting. We get a new sheriff and they expect something out of him.”

“I hope you didn’t vote for the bastard.” I scrambled the eggs with one hand and threw in spices with the other.

“Hell no. I’ll be lucky to have a job come August.”

“It’s only April, you got time left to make Lieutenant.” He walked behind me and poured himself coffee.

“You want some more?”

“Nah. I’ll be pissing all day if I do.”

“What’s on your plate today?” He asked as I doled out the eggs among the two of us.

“Well besides this amazing breakfast I figure I’ll start in on the irrigation system.”

“Better you than me.”

“Well I got the stuff damn cheap so the least I can do is install it. It’s gonna be a dry year. I can tell it now.” I put

“Go to hell.” He shuffled off to get dressed. I washed the dishes and set them up to dry, I felt like an old woman every time I did that. I made a quick trip upstairs and grabbed the small pile of laundry, I did it every day so it never accumulated too much. Andrew came bounding down the stairs just as I walked back into the kitchen for my boots.

“Are we doing lunch today?” He asked strapping his vest on.

“I’ll probably work through it today. There’s a lot to do with the plumbing.”

“All right. Jennifer and I are going out tonight so don’t expect me till late.”

“Shit I don’t even have to stop for dinner then.” I chuckled pulling on my boots.

“Well let’s hope I don’t make it back here tonight Charlie.” He smiled and buttoned his shirt on.

“That’d be a pleasant change.” I threw back at him.

“See you brother.”

“I’ll be waiting brother.” Andrew buckled his belt on and strode out, his cruiser pulling out as I stepped out.
  It was a crisp morning, the kind that made your eyes water. As I stepped through the dewy grass, thank God it wasn’t covered in frost, the sun glinted off the thin wires between posts. These grapes were my life, my employment and in more ways than I cared to dawdle on, my love. I operated one of the only vineyards in the state, some said I was too far North to make good wine. I said screw them. It was a small operation sure but I made enough from the batches to cover the operating cost, the corn and beans kept the lights on and Andrew’s job made sure the house was ours. Like any ‘hobby’ farmer I made money but I wasn’t by any means loaded. 
  I stood in front of the stack of pipes under the worn tarp. I had bought them off the hardware store when the old timer got run out of business by Wal-Mart, he could have gotten much more for it for scrap but he wanted it put to good use. I promised Walter I’d use it on the grapes, he had sold stuff to my father and then me for some forty years. Last time I talked to his wife she didn’t expect him to live to summer. 
  I tore the tarp off and tallied up the bundle; it was probably enough for five or six rows, that was more than half. I still had to decide how to use it though. A drip feed system would be better for them but it would be consuming both in materials and labor. I could build a sprinkler type system but that wouldn’t be as efficient or effective. It’d be less plumbing work though. I mulled it over as I opened the barn door and poured out dog food. Sammy hobbled out of his house across the yard, lazy ass dog. I got him when I came back from Iraq years ago, both of us are getting old. Reggie came bounding out behind him, that dog would be the death of all three of us. They had an interesting dynamic the old beagle and the young pointer. 
“Morning boys.” They nuzzled me in acknowledgement and set in on their breakfast. While they chomped away I pulled the shovel off the wall and started making mental measurements. I’d bury most of the pipe from the barn to the arbor and use a sprinkler every other row. Maybe the water company would hook it up or maybe I would, plumbing was the one thing I absolutely sucked at. If I skipped lunch I could get it done today, that sure be nice. But I did love lunch.

  Andrew stepped back into his cruiser and turned on the computer. While it booted he sent Jennifer a text message about tonight. The mayor was in a predictably excited mood, he saw some potential for the department now. The new sheriff, Wyandot, had worked as a town cop years before, Andrew only met him once before he left. The word though was that he was an asshole, more than that a political asshole.
“Dispatch this is William-6, I didn’t have a chance to speak with Ray before he left. Anything happen last night?” There was no delay from Susie’s response, twenty years of the work had made her quick on the mic.
“There was a domestic out past Greenmile. It was a slow Wednesday night for a change.”
“Let’s hope it stays that way. I’m gonna start my beat now.”
“Roger William-6.”
  The sheriff’s department had been dealing with budget issues for years and it had recently come to a head. Because of this the Bethesda police (us town cops) were allowed to patrol the county with the Deputies. It was a lot of paperwork but it beat only having one Sheriff’s Deputy out at any given time. It was quiet mostly but there was always work. Andrew eased the Crown Vic out onto the street. It was rush hour, everybody was busting out of town to get to jobs in Milford, and there were speeding tickets to be distributed.
  He hadn’t done a check of his car before he left but he didn’t always, since he ranked as a Sergeant he had his own patrol car and kept it stocked the way he liked. It had the standard loadout of highway tools and emergency gear. Homeland security had come through a few years before and given out all new stuff, he was the only one who still kept his in good shape. His car, and possibly himself, were the heaviest armed in the county. A Charles Daly riot-gun rode at arm’s reach and his M4 carbine, one Charlie had brought back from Iraq, was stowed in the trunk. His belt held a .41 magnum revolver along with a taser and a baton, his Maglight rounded out the armory. A .380 holdout pistol was strapped to his ankle but that hardly counted as a gun. Andrew had never personally been in a firefight but he had drawn his gun just about every other day he worked. There were always old cops that said they’d worked for 30 years and never drawn, there was a reason they weren’t working anymore. The old police chief had been one of them, he retired after getting taking a round in the vest.
  Andrew loved being a cop, the diversity of the work, the authority of being the right hand of the law and the thrill of just doing it. He understood the danger but wasn’t turned off by it, what was the point of living if there was no danger, no thrill of living. He had worked as a real estate agent out of college and wanted to die every day, he wasn’t designed for that kind of work. So he rode the back roads and small towns of the county with a smile. All the while as he was pulling a man hair-first off his beater wife or washing the puke out of the backseat he smiled. There was no other job for him.

  When I was in the Army, they taught me one thing: always have a shovel with you; they’re useful beyond your imagination. I had already dug the channels and laid the pipes and it was only eleven, but the hardest part had been hooking it up to the water in the barn. My first attempt ended in geyser of water shooting three feet out of my shoddy coupling. My second attempt involved beating the pipe with the shovel trying to get the size right. That one met with more success.
“Fuck Sam, check this shit out.” He looked at me from the nearby shade of a cherry tree, he knew better than to point out my utter lack of plumbing skills “I’m like a young, more handsome Bob Villa. I need to work on my beard though.”
  I turned the water back on and waited for some type of explosion. There wasn’t amazingly. I decided to leave the pipes unburied for a few days, see if there was any leaks that I didn’t have to dig up later. As I walked back to the house Reggie barked once, someone had started down the driveway. The dog may have been neurotic and clumsy as hell but he always watched out for us. Sure enough as I rounded the house a pickup truck rolled to a stop. It was Metzger from up the road, he came by to shoot the shit every once in a while.

“How ya doin John?” I shouted sidestepping into the kitchen.

“Pretty good Charlie.”

“You want a beer or anything?” I yelled out the screen door with my arm in the frig.

“If you have a Bug Light I’d take it.” I pulled two out and walked out to meet him.

“Little early to be drinking isn’t it?” He took it from my hands and cracked it in one motion.

“Well my old lady and I got in a squabble this morning so I figured I better make myself scarce for a while.”

“I’ll drink to that.” We toasted cans.

“I was driving by earlier and I thought I saw water or something shooting up back there.”

“Yeah it was water. I’m putting in a new irrigation system and I uhhh…I’m not an expert.” We both chuckled from experience.

“You should get that checked for code before you start working on it.”

“Well it’s stainless and it’s just going to the vines. It’s not like there’s any sewage or anything out there.”

“Well I’d be careful anyway. The Low’s with the horse farm up the street got city water installed a few weeks ago. They ran it back from their stable on existing pipes to save money, I guess Harry had them installed when he was still alive. So they see a leak springing out of the ground in one of the fields between the house and there so they go out and dig it up and they find a horse grave. So they get that out of there and dig down some more and find a pipe under it with a leak. They had been drinking water from a rotting horse for almost a month.”

“Shit.” The beer suddenly didn’t seem so refreshing “Well my dad and granddad cleared all this land years ago. The only graves around here are groundhogs.”

“That’s why I have a well. Damn state has to come out and check it all the time but it’s worth it.”

“They fuck you that way. When I built the new barn a few years ago they charged an arm and a leg for all the permits.”

“Yep.” We stood in silence for a moment, the eternal gentlemanly pause to let the conversation turn elsewhere “So are the pipes for the grapes?”

“Yeah. I figure it’s better than dragging the hose out every other day.”

“How’s the new batch of wine coming?”

“Doing pretty good. I imagine by Christmas I’ll start bottling.”

“We still have a few bottles from last year. The wife loves the stuff.”

“Well you know what they say, everything’s better in the country. How’s your cattle coming?”

“Good. The price of beef keeps going up so I got nothing to complain about. We’ve lost one though this year already to coyotes.”

“Already? Damn.”

“These new hybrid bastards are aggressive. Whatever part wolf they have in them is mean boy. I try to stay up sometimes and wait for them but I’m just too old to sit half the night in the cold.”

“I can come down sometimes if you’d like, I love shooting shit.”

“Anytime you want Charlie you can shoot those damn things.”

“I forget about them most of the times. The dogs keep them away, especially the new one. He’s not afraid to fight them boy, he’s come back chewed up a couple times.”

“They’ll do that. I’d be scared he’d run off with em.”

“Nah, he likes eating grapes too much.”

“A dog will eat those?”

“Sure. After we’re done each year the rejects and ground up pulps he’ll scarf down. Crazy ass dog.”

“He doesn’t keep the deer away does he?”

“From around the house yeah but Andrew’ll go out all the time and get one.” I drank the last of my drink, it was getting warm out and I’d need something to settle it soon “Can I get you another beer?”

“No the last thing I wanna do is come back drunk, she’ll murder me right there. I don’t have the stomach for heavy drinking anymore.” He opened the door and climbed back in his truck.

“It’s hell getting old.” I snorted.

“We’re all young once. You see the army taught us both to drink.”

“That it did. Anymore the only thing that can get me there is scotch.”

“Goddamn that stuff. I had a bottle once at my brother’s wedding and I puked for three days.”

“Lightweight.” He grinned and started the engine.

“Anytime you feel like it you can come down to my place and get the bastards. Just knock on the door first so I don’t shoot you myself.”

“I don’t wanna catch you with your pants down John.”

“Like that happens anymore!” He cackled and backed away, Christ I loved that old man

***

Thursday.

Just before dawn, the crew and I were awakened by a bloodcurdling scream in the distance.  I checked my watch as I got up.  4:43am.  I opened my tent and crawled out.  Mike and Tim were both already outside of their respective tents.

“You guys heard that too?” I croaked out, still groggy.

“Yeah,” Tim replied.  Where did it co...”

We heard another scream.  It came from off in the distance to the south of us – near the cast's campsite.

“Mike, we weren't planning any gags for tonight, were we?” I asked.

“No.  We better check that out.”

At that point, Tim noticed that Chris's tent door was open and that his tent was empty.  “Uh, guys... where's Chris?”

Shit.  Without anything else said, and just a brief exchanged look of concern, we ran off in the direction of the scream, lanterns in hand.

As we neared the source of the screams, a gurgling noise became audible – the sort of noise that you hear in horror films when a victim is choking on his own blood.

“Chris!” Mike called out, hoping to locate our director.  There was no answer.  The gurgling sound continued, much louder now.  We were close.

We stopped for a moment and each of us held our lanterns high, scouring the forest for any signs of movement.

After a few moments of dead silence, Tim quietly said, “What is that?” He pointed at something in the woods.

We all turned, and saw a human figure slowly walking towards us.  We stood firm, knowing there were no real dangers in these woods – at least not besides black bears, and this was definitely not a bear.

“Ereshkigal was hungry.”  The voice seemed to originate from the figure, but ultimately sounded like it came from all around us.  The figure trudged closer.  As soon as our lights caught a good look, we realized it was Chris.  It wasn't Chris, though.  It might have been his body, his voice, but it wasn't him.  His eyes were glassy again, and reflecting light much the way a cat's eyes do when caught in a bit of light in the darkness.  Our lanterns didn't give off enough light to make his eyes glow as brightly as they did.  He was carrying something.  What was he carrying?

“I had to sate Erishkigal.  She needed food,” Chris muttered as he got closer to us.  “She needed blood.”  By now we could tell he was carrying a chain with something attached to it... meat hooks?  Yes, it was a chain lined with meat hooks. The hook closest to Chris's hand was covered in blood, with what appeared to be a bit of meat or flesh hanging from it.

Stunned, we all just stood there, frozen in fear as Chris continued walking towards us, into the middle of the group, and then away from us after passing.

Mike broke the silence, “Chris, what are you talking about?”

No answer.

“Chris!  Talk to me!” Mike demanded.

No answer.

Just as Chris was nearly out of the short range of our lanterns, he turned, looked at us each individually, his glassy, vacant eyes seeming to pierce our souls.  He grinned and said, “Look up, look down, look to life and death, and you'll understand.”  He turned and headed slowly back towards the campsite, fading from the view of our lanterns.

Stunned, Mike, Tim, and I just stood there, looking at each other.  We had to be standing there in silence for a while, because the early dawn started to brighten the sky.

Tim was the first to speak. “Let's check out the cast campsite.  I have to know what happened.  I want to make sure everyone is okay.”

We headed towards the cast campsite.  After about a hundred feet we found something that will forever be imprinted in my mind.  Joe, one of the cast members, was bound to a tree with chains.  He had meat hooks piercing both of his shoulders and a large wound in his chest.  His head was slumped forward, his breath coming in short, shallow bursts.

“Oh shit.  Joe!” I shouted.  “Joe, are you alive?  Can you hear me?”  His head raised slowly, blood pouring from his mouth.

“H... hel... help me...” he managed to gasp out.

“Did Chris do this to you?”

His head shook slightly before falling forward again. “Not... Chris.... Eresh... Eresh... kigal... only...” he paused to pant for a moment, his breathing sickly and wet, filled with blood.  By this point, Mike was already on the phone, I assume he was trying to call an ambulance.  “It...” Joe continued, “it only... looks... like Chris...”  With that, he gurgled as more blood filled his throat and his head fell forward again.

“FUCK!” Mike shouted. “I can't get a fucking signal out here.” He looked at Joe, “We're going to help you man.  You're going to be just fine.”  Mike looked at Tim, and Tim already seemed to know what Mike was going to ask.

“I'm going to get the car,” Tim said.  He ran off towards the road and our campsite.

Fortunately, all of the campsites in the area were not far from the road through the forest.

Mike and I went and tended to Joe, just trying to make sure he was still alive, and doing what we could without any first aid supplies.  We unbound him and sacrificed our shirts as makeshift bandages for his shoulders and chest.  All the while, Joe's head just hung there, with blood still pouring out of his mouth, his breath still short and wet.  He was alive, but just barely.

About five minutes later, Tim showed up with his car, a heavy blanket stretched across the back seat.  We loaded Joe in, and told Tim to keep trying to call for help on his way to the nearest hospital, which was about 50 miles down the road in the closest town.  Tim sped off.

I sat down on a nearby log, closing my eyes for a moment.  I had to get the adrenaline to stop pumping.  I needed to think rationally.  I felt the log shift slightly as Mike sat down next to me.  He put his hand on my shoulder.  I could sense him trying to calm down as well.

62,Update #2 to Nearsighted Story:  A chat with my parents this weekend,1300827673,"Hey guys, here’s my second update to this story.   I didn’t expect to actually look into my childhood memory this much, but it has really freaked me out.  Curiosity got the best of me after talking to my sister and I decided to talk to my mom.   If you haven’t already, you’re going to need to read my [original story](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g4s34/nearsighted/) and [update #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g634u/update_to_nearsighted_story_convo_with_my_sister/) to understand where this post is coming from.     

[Email to my mom, Saturday evening after I had to fib and tell her my phone was broken so she'd get on chat, which she hates, so I could paste it for you guys.  Also I decided I'll be using fake names from now on to protect the innocent and whatnot, but too bad for fuckin’ Laura]

Me [email]:   Sorry I had to call you from Ron's [my boyfriend] phone.  My cell isn't working right now but it will be fixed soon.  Can you get on chat, I want to ask you some stuff.

Mom [email ~1 hr later]:  I need to do some things tonight.  I don’t like the whole “chat” business.  It’s so impersonal.  Your gen has their heads buried in computers and phones, it’s too much for oldies like me and dad!  

Tomorrow evening I can sit down and have a little chat with you if your phone isn’t fixed by then, but please try to get it fixed.  What if there’s an emergency?

Love you,

Mom

[Sunday evening I talked to her (and my dad) for about two hours, chats shown from now on.   Give them a break, they don’t do the whole online chatting thing]

Mom:  Okay, I am in the chat window.  I hope I can type fast enough to keep up with you, my lovely child.

Love, Mom

Sent at 6:27 PM on Sunday

Me:  Thank you!

By the way, you don’t have to say the chat is from you, I know it’s you

Mom:  Okay, I get it.

Me:  So I have a question about when we moved into the Maple St. house 

Mom:  Alright, may I ask why this is on your mind?

Me:  Just curious…

So who owned the house before us?  

Who did we buy it from, like did you meet them?

Mom:  Well, we really did everything through the realtor, but it was an older couple looking to downsize and move into an assisted living apartment, I believe.    No, I never did meet them.  Let me ask dad real quick.

Me:  Okay, and I have a few other questions

Mom:  Yes, Officer [MyopicBliss]?

Me:  lol

sorry

Do you remember when Grandma G. got me and Casey the Barbie dolls that Easter, she sent them in a huge package with the Easter basket because she was too far away to visit?

Mom:  She spoiled you girls!  Casey and you were very excited, we had to tell her they were from Grandma G. and not the Easter Bunny so you kids could thank her.  

Me:  haha

Anyway, late that night Casey decided to stay up and play with the Barbies after it was lights out, and of course I wanted to play with them too.

Mom:  Oh did you, now.  No wonder you two always took long naps during the day, you were little night owls breaking the rules.  You must get that from your dad.    

Me:  Yeah we still are

So that night we were playing and had the door a little open like always, and all of a sudden I saw dad standing there and I thought we were going to get in huge trouble, because playing after lights-out was a groundable offense, but he looked in then just turned around and left like nothing happened.   I was really excited that we didn’t get in trouble but Casey was just staring in fear at the door and she said that the man there wasn’t dad.  I couldn’t tell because I hadn’t gotten glasses yet.

Mom:  I remember this!  Casey had an imaginary old man friend that she would not shut up about at school.   It got her in big trouble because the teacher thought some weirdo “family friend” was living with us and watching her sleep at night or something absolutely ridiculous.  I had to straighten things out, but the teachers were all in a tizzy about it.  

Me:  No!  It was not imaginary, we both saw him that night 

and other times too.  

Mom:  There was absolutely NO one breaking in or living there, my paranoid kiddo!!  I don’t know what you girls thought you saw, but you had pretty big imaginations.  For god’s sake [MyopicBliss] you thought an imaginary turtle was going to eat your feet when you were 4.  

Me:  I looked delicious

Mom:  You are too funny.  Here’s your dad.  Give him a few minutes to read our chat and I’ll show him how to reply.

[several minutes later…]

Dad:  Hi!  its dad!!

moms making fun of me because she thinks I “hunt and peck”

I told her its my own typing style and you have to take a little longer to get the job done right.  hahaha

She won’t stop looking over my shoulder now

Me:  Hi dad, did you read my story?

Dad:  She is in the kitchen now but she doesnt trust me

she thinks I’m going to crash the computer by accidentally hitting the wrong keys with my fat fingers

Yes, that sounded creepy.  I can tell you it was not me!  Thats for sure

I think I have a vauge memory of being told to “search the house” one morning before work

with a baseball bat of course

Me:  haha

Dad:  You know mom got feelings like she was being watched in that house

nothing really scary or threatening.. but she said she thought she “glimpsed” who she thought was me for a second a few times when I was at work

I had to work swing shift and graveyard for some time after I started working at [plant], you remember

Me:  No way, she didn’t tell me that…

And she doesn’t believe me and Casey?

Dad:  Hypocrit!! 

how do I delete this?  I don’t want her reading it!!! 

or I’ll get hollered at

Me:  I’ll tell you how at the end

Dad:  Oh ok I see what your getting at  

You want to know if I remember what the old homeowner looked like to see if he was sneaking back in the house once in awhile.

[Way to long a pause in the chat for me to handle, my heart was pounding like mad]

Me:  Dear god man, type faster!

Dad:  sorry I had to take a bathroom break

He was a fat old man in a wheelchair and he could no longer get upstairs easily, so he and his wife moved to an old folks home.

Me:  Hmmm, doesn’t sound like the guy 

Any old neighbors?  I don’t remember any…

Dad:  Nah that neighborhood was all couples with young kids.  

There were no Alzheimers folks wandering around into houses if thats what you mean

Me:  I guess it’s just a mystery

Dad:  That is pretty strange though

[Irrelevant chats for awhile and me explaining to him how to do stuff]

Dad:  Ok, mom wants me to ask if you have been to the eye doctor recently.  

She thinks you should go now while you are still on our insurance plan.  

Me: uhhh lemme think

Dad: lemme lemme lemme

Mom doesnt like me on the internet

she thinks I’ll get addicted and become fat and lazy

Me:  lol 

No, not for a year or so, but my vision hasn’t gotten any worse for like 5 or 6 years

Dad:  well the reason I ask is that uncle Dannys having some vision problems.

Don’t worry about him or anything, but he needs a surgery now.

Me:  Really?  What’s wrong with him??

Dad:  he is fine

Really don’t worry 

He started getting some lens opacity in his right eye and it progressed fast so hes getting a fake plastic lens put in to replace it

Me:  I don’t understand, is it like a permanent contact lens?  

Dad:  Nonono

Its from an inherited disorder inside the eye…in the lens

He just developed a cataract that got worse in a short time, so he scheduled surgery

Your grandpa had them too, remember?

[I can tell you, at this point I had been ignoring my screen for a minute and when I read that I had a major fight-or flight response and my body did not know what to do.  I squealed/screamed, stood straight up and backed away from the computer, got all jittery, then got lightheaded and had to lay down on my bed.  My boyfriend thought I was a lunatic.  Apparently I kept saying over and over “I’ll tell you later, I’ll tell you later…”]

Me:  Have you been talking to Casey????

Seriously… In the past few days has she called you?  

Are you shitting me?

Dad:  No why…

is she having vision problems now?

Me:  No

Please tell me you’re shitting me 

Dad:  STop saying that!!!  mom might read this and get mad at me because your cussing 

what am I “shitting” you about exactly?

Me:  Grandpa having cataracts??

Dad:  Well, I guess you wouldn’t remember because you were barely 3 when he passed and Casey was only 18 mo.

and he always wore sunglasses when we brought you girls over to see him and Gramma G because he didn’t want to scare you, but he wasnt able to see well with them on either

He had a partial cataract in his left eye and he was totally blind in his right eye, so he would just sit and listen to you girls play  

Me:  Dad seriously tell me you’re joking

Dad:  I do not understand what your major malfunction is [MyopicBliss]

Your not going to get cataracts any time soon if thats what your worried about

we just wanted you to get an eye check up

Me:  The man in our room

Casey said he wasn’t really looking at us, but kind of into the room because he had white eyes 

Dad:  now your the one whose joking

Me:  I swear, you can ask her

Dad:  are you kidding me?

this is getting bizarre

Me:  Was your dad kind of tall and thin and frail with gray/white hair?  

Dad:  he was

Not when he was younger though

he got skinny and frail in his old age 

Me:  do we have any pictures????

Dad:  this is just too weird for me

are you and your sister pulling our leg?

Me:  I swear we’re not

Dad:  oh he hated having his picture taken once he started showing his age and developed the eye condition

he thought he looked scary and always turned his back if anyone had a camera out

but I’m sure we have a few around here somewhere, or Gramma G does

ooo I’ve got a case of the chills down my back

63,She's Not Human,1300823168,"--------------------------

I just found this over in /R/Askreddit I thought I should post it here. 

This is just a troll right?

---------------------------

I don't know what she is but I know that she's not human. She looks human. She acts human. But she's not human. I know that sounds crazy, I know that everything I'm about to write will sound crazy too. So let me be clear on one point before I continue; I do not question my sanity.


From behind the locked door I just heard: ""Please stop doing this."" 


You know how when some people tell a story they start it off in the middle, or even at the end? Well, I'd hate to be ""that guy"", it's just distracting when she (it) keeps trying to trick me. Also, I would love to just hit those good points or tell you what's going on right this second, then explain how I got here. I can't do that though. It would sure as hell be a good popcorn read for you, but I don't think it would help my sanity case. If you want to know what happened you'll just have to deal with hearing it from the beginning. There's not a lot of time, so I'll make it quick. I promise. 


Behind the locked door: ""The bleeding won't stop. Why won't you answer me. I need help."" 


I first saw her (it) while I was at game-central. Average height. Average build. Average Clothing. Absolutely nothing stood out about her. I suppose she   could have been anyone. That was probably the point, right? Anyway, she smiled at me while she handled my transaction at the register. We made some small talk about the game I was buying. Then I left. Sorry if you were expecting something more but I refuse to embellish this story. If you're bored leave, I'm going to continue to tell it like it happened. (JUST LIKE A SANE PERSON WOULD.)


Behind the locked door: ""Let me out goddamnit! Someone HELP! What are you going to do with me!?"" 


A few days went by. Then I happened to run into her (it) again at the local coffee shop. I swear I wasn't the one that initiated contact. It was her that said something about recognizing me from her job. I was just being nice so I asked if she wanted to join me. We talked about a lot of important things: politics, drugs, video games, etc... Even though I wasn't particularly interested in this girl I asked for her number when I got the vibe that she was into me.


Behind the locked door: Just crying now.


Into me, she (it) was. I had her in my bed the next day. Rather, she had me in my bed. The sex was pretty good to be honest. We smoked a bowl then played some Wii while sitting naked on the couch. After that, this girl (thing) was over ever night. I seemed to have managed to land an unwanted girlfriend. Just to be sure I was really O.K. with the idea, I had her make dinner one night. It wasn't half bad. So What the hell, I though, just go with it.


Behind the locked door: Just more crying.


So by now I think you see what I mean. The forward thinking, get-what-you-want attitude aside, she (it) seems absolutely human in every way. Just your typical average american girl. That's the problem. Everything is just too normal. Something had to be wrong with her. Had to be. Whatever it was, I was going to find it.


Behind the locked door: ""I'm sorry if what I did hurt you.""


Listen, I'll admit I began to get a little obsessed with finding her faults. I know you're probably saying to yourself that this is where my crazy starts to show, but you know what, fuck you, everyone does this when they get involved with somebody. (If you are one of the ones I just cussed at there, I'm sorry. I though about deleting this whole paragraph but I chose to leave it because I feel like it shows that I'm in control.) 


Behind the locked door: ""I know you're still out there. Listen to me. I was scared that I was falling for you. I... I have fallen for you."" 


I found nothing. I guess that's when I started to realize I was in trouble. She (it) noticed that I seemed distressed. I told her that everything was fine. That night was when the idea (truth) finally came to me. She was sleeping next to me and I was just watching her in the darkness. She's perfect, I thought. I wanted to toss the idea away but Sherlock Holmes whispered ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"". And there is no doubt that you will agree a girl without flaw can't exist. It was then that I realized I could find no human flaw with her because she (it) simply was not human. 


Behind the locked door: Silence now.


She (it) woke up and asked me to put my arms around her. I did. She said that she was glad she had me before drifting off back to sleep. Me on the other hand, I stayed awake trying to figure out how to prove she wasn't human. I spent the whole night planning. The next day went by in a blur. She wasn't human, but what was she? How could I prove what I know to be true?


Behind the locked door: ""I don't know what you're doing out there. But if you can hear me, I want you to know that I have fallen in love with you.""


It was about an hour ago that she came back over. I still didn't have a plan.  She (it) could tell something was wrong and asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I said ""I know the truth."" I saw her expression change slightly. ""What do you think you know?"" ""I know about you"" I said, ""I know what you're not human.""She tried to touch me. I stepped away. ""Why are you being like this?"" I tried to hold back the emotion but it was too much I started to cry. ""Just tell me the truth. Fuck."" She sat on the couch and put her head down.


Behind the locked door: More crying.


I kept asking again and again to tell me why it chose me. She (it) wouldn't answer. The longer this went on the angrier I got. Something had to be done. I grabbed her. I told her I was going to prove she wasn't human. All the while she's going on and on about being sorry for seeing her ex earlier in the day. (Like I give a fuck about that?) All I want is the truth.


Behind the locked door: ""You can't keep me locked in here forever. Please let me out and we can talk.""


Something had to be done. You see that right? I ran to the kitchen to grab a knife, but then I saw the hammer and took that instead. She (it) saw the look on my face and she probably thought I was going to bash her head in. I won't lie, the though did cross my mind. Instead of striking her skull I smashed one of her fingers. She (it) pushed me away and ran for the door. I swung and caught a lucky shot on her ankle. ""You Asshole!"" She screamed as fell to the floor. Before she could get back up, I was on her.


Behind the locked door: ""Are you typing something?""


She (it) stopped struggling. She tried to tell me she loved me. I picked her up and carried her to the bedroom. I locked her in there and that's about when sat down to type this... what is this anyway? I suppose it's going to be one of the longest ASKREDDIT posts ever made. I don't even know what I'm suppose to ask. I just need help figuring this thing out.


Behind the locked door: ""This is bullshit! Don't you see I love you. I'm tired of playing games. Let me out!""


Yes, I did think about killing her (it), but it looks human, bleeds human, and acts human, so all that will do is land me a Murder 1 rap. 


Behind the locked door: ""Talk to me!""


""I know you are not human!""


Behind the locked door: ""Baby... please.""


""Why me, what do you want from me!"" 


Behind the locked door: ""I wanted to be with you.""


Do you see what I mean? How can I prove this. 


""I'm not stupid. I know something is wrong here.""


Behind the locked door: ""I went to see my ex because I was scared I was falling in love with you. Is that so hard to understand. I needed to make sure. And I am.""


""I just want the truth. Give me the truth and I won't kill you.""


Behind the locked door: ""I want to be with you.""


""Tell me what I want to know. I'm about to open the door. When i do, I'm going to beat you to death. This is you're last chance.""


I really can't believe those words even came out of my mouth. What have I become.


Behind the locked door: Silence.


Behind the locked door: ""The truth? Everything I said is true. Haven't you heard a word? I chose you because you and I are so similar. I didn't plan on falling for you. I got scared so I went to see him to make sure it was alright to be with you.""


Now it's me crying out here. I can't take this shit anymore. It's over, I give up. Human or thing, it's clear I'm not a killer. I'm just a shitty boyfriend. That's all I am.


""Are you still bleeding.""


Behind the locked door: ""It's not as bad now. I would appreciate a towel or something though.""


""I'm sorry. Really, I am. I think I've lost it. It's this whole situation.""


Behind the locked door: ""I know, I'm sorry too. It's partly my fault. Will you open up the door now, please?""


""In just a second. I don't want you too see me like this.""


Behind the locked door: ""Good. I am in love with you and I would still like to work this out, babe.""


""I don't know. I'm a psychotic wreck. You're better off without me.""


Behind the locked door: ""I know. It's my fault. And I'm the one that's sorry. We could try to be together... Deep down, you're wondering why I'm still here. You just can't seem to accept that I've really fallen in love with you. But it's alright, really. I was warned by the Executor that this might happen when the mating season ended. He said that if our long-term relationship didn't work out I could still take your seed one last time before removing your head and eating your brain, as is the normal custom. Babe? You almost done?""


That last proposition seems very appealing.


""Yeah, I'm posting this right now.""


Good bye.

65,My childhood ghost experience,1300816387,"It started when I was young, footsteps, the creaking of cabinets and doors, the usual creepy stuff that happens at night in a century old home. It was jarring enough, combined with my night terrors, constantly waking up in cold sweats, I was quite on edge as a little kid.
I remember time in particular that still gives me chills. It started out as a dream, I woke up in my bed, and I felt as if I was being called down to my basement. As I navigated down the steps into my dark basement I fell over our weight set, badly cutting my knee. After a moment I looked into the direction I felt i was being drawn too, the closet.  The door immediately slammed, and then there was an echoing feminine laughter. I then blacked out.

I woke up in a small pool of blood, in the basement next o the weight set, closet door closed. I got the hell out of there.

Not jaded or shadowed

If sought found nowhere

And upon you entering you are met with a cheer

 as the hollow grey face of clerk comes near

His smile is hollow

and a little too wide

His breath smells of nickels

And his scalp is dried

His glance comes to jeer 

as it stays far too long

As his hand comes too near

He says ""Welcome son""

As you dribble through empty aisles

In the flickering light

A single shelf appears

Polished and bright

Holding one item

of ultimate desire

For a reasonable cost

But the true price is quite dire

As you take your token

and hurry in unease

When you pay for your prize

The clerk utters disease

You pay your cost

He gives you teeth in change

as he smiles again

Now toothless and strange

You hurry home and place your object away

Maybe even forget it after a few days

But when the lights start to flicker

and your scalp starts to dry

Your teeth feel loose

67,Tapping Down My Door,1300799801,"I'm not sure if you would consider my story creepy or supernatural, but after reading so many of your tales I wanted to share.

This took place many years ago when I lived with a couple of friends I had known since high school. The house was large, a split level with 4 bedrooms on the upper floor. The lower floor was spread out with a large living room, a den, huge kitchen, and a large screened patio.

Late one evening I was home alone, my roommates were still at work, out to dinner, whatever. I decided to relax by laying on my bed with a book. The house was completely quiet - the one dog was asleep in a roommate's bedroom and the cat was outside. 

If you can imagine someone using both hands tapping with all fingers from the top of your door to the bottom, that's what I heard. A bunch of fingers with nails long enough to touch the wood banging their way down my door! It lasted less than 5 seconds and it was so loud it scared the ever loving shit out of me! 

My initial reaction was anger, thinking one my roommates had gotten home, come in the house quietly, and decided to toy with me. I jumped out of bed, ran to the door, jerked it open, and found nobody there, but I remember a strong smell of vanilla. As far as I knew, none of us burned vanilla candles or wore vanilla scented anything. This house has old hardwood floors that creak when you walk on them. There's no way someone could have made that sound and sprinted away without making some noise.

I went to the front door, no cars were home. I walked through the house, nobody was there. I told my roommates about this as they arrived home and one of them said he had seen a man in a mid-1800s suit and bowler hat standing in the living room one night. After a double-take the man was gone. He definitely believed the house had some supernatural prescence.

This was the only thing I experienced in the house, but it was enough for me.",nosleep,digitaldevil,/r/nosleep/comments/g8wsi/tapping_down_my_door/

71,At Last,1300771796,"Not long after the advent of the internet, people the world over began to come together in an unprecedented way. With direct, person to person communication made possible, first-world countries began to forgo political representatives in favor of various flavors of what would come to be known simply as 'direct democracy'. Just as the American revolution fomented liberation over large swaths of the world, technology brought on a whole new magnitude of personal freedom roughly equal to the difference between a monarchy and a republic. The old guard kicked and screamed, and threw all of their money into a collective corporate hissy fit, but this only served to hasten their descent towards irrelevance.

First a few notable but comparatively small European countries made the switch. For nearly a decade only Swedes and internet dorks watched in bated breath, wondering if a communications based government could work. The rest started to take notice, however, when quality of life skyrocketed across the board in nearly every governance which switched to complete self rule. The old assumptions about the peasants' inability to rule themselves were swept away. Apparently a few million middle class yobs do indeed have more wisdom than any room full of power brokers, even if they do occasionally vote themselves into a stupid situation. There were false starts of course. The UK famously modeled their online voting apparatus after 'facebook', which nearly led to a civil war when half the country attempted to completely defund the internet infrastructure of the other half.


As time went on and this new quality of life spread even to traditionally unstable countries, at last the world fell in line by choice, and without force. Suddenly all the quiet, normal folks could sing in a chorus much louder than the partisans could jabber and froth. This new enlightenment continued into the second half of this century. Within a single generation the world had eliminated most forms of suffering, and the worlds' former leaders could only shift their eyes towards the floor when presented with how easy it could actually be. Time progressed further, and people started to wonder what new heights humanity could reach-- we're not a sedentary race, you see. With increased funding for science the world was able to make exploration exciting and popular again, yet even with nearly a centuries' computational progress under their belt, terraformation and space travel were still prohibitively expensive and time consuming. So with no quick way to go up, and no good reason to go down, humanity could only attempt to travel deeper within themselves.

It started when an open-source tech consortium (previously known as 'Microsoft') figured out how to interface with the human brain in a meaningful way. What neurologists and prosthetic engineers had been overlooking all those years was the way the human brain processes time. We now know that one of the largest factors in both intelligence and creativity lays in how 'fast' a person's brain is. By emulating a human brain neuron for neuron in bits and tailoring prosthetics with a unique AI for that brain, the two could be linked to reroute neural pathways into a virtual conduit, thereby creating the 'neural bit'; i.e. a mind emulated once over experiences time at exactly half it's normal speed, thereby increasing it's thinking power in that window of time by two.

Simply put, one nb is equal to roughly twice the processing power of a single, unaltered mind. This resulted in some unfortunate incidents when researchers attempted to sync up two different emulated brains, as one brain's nb is likely to have a different value than another due to differences in the amount of avialable neurons and how they're wired. Having twice the time in your day to do as you wish is nice, but isn't practical when everyone else appears to be functioning in slow motion. Plus their emulated brain was limited, all it did was alter your perception of time. Obviously there were much more exciting uses for neural bitrate systems. When they finally learned to sync minds the next step was to flesh out the capabilities of the emulated brain.

At last, mankind could live as it wished, wherever it wished, and there could be no consequences. Reality could now be fabricated in any way a man could see fit within one emulated brain, or an indefinite number of synced brains. As many predicted at the time, these new capabilities didn't work out as one would hope. Instead of the AI overlords seen in the anachronistic 'The Matrix' from the late twentieth century, mankinds' biggest threat came to be extreme apathy. Who wants to vote, or procreate, when you can pretend to be Harry Potter, or Leonardo Da'vinci? Why, people even began altering their minds to believe they were these characters and historical figures, discarding whatever identity they had in favor of fantasy.

More and more people took measures to maintain their physical forms seperate from their virtual selves, without ever moving an inch from the room they were born in. Doctors and nurses, teachers and scholars... all of them were made obselete. Life for your average human became an automated tour of their wildest fantasies. The remaining of the famous and elite increasingly experienced bouts of disassociation, as they couldn't be sure if they were truly successful, or some forgotten entity living out a virtual fantasy. On the bright side suicides and murders nearly stopped completely; why take such drastic measues when you can alter who you are on a whim and simply forget what's bothering you? Even the worst criminals could simply be wiped clean of their memories and stripped of their antisocial tendancies.

At last, mankind freed itself from violence. But the cost was a plateau in progress. Man stood collectively at the precipace of a true, full blown technological singularity, yet there were so few left cognizent of the real world. From the start there had been anti tech groups who decided tinkering with the brain was going too far. However most of them were staunched by their own sort of shortsightedness, as their anti-tech sentiments were based in fear and faith, rather than cautious reason. None of it made a difference anyway. People ignored drives to 'unplug and take part'. They even ignored social workers who tried to convince them to rejoin humanity, in any capacity, at least part of the time. There are more and more 'lost causes' every day, what with the new generation essentially being born plugged in. There are people out there who wouldn't know real life if they saw it. Things have been going downhill and half of these folks won't notice until the system shuts down and they collectively starve to death in atrophied heaps of flesh and bone. The thing is... none of that compares to the greatest sins commited with nb tech. The apathy, the rapidly declining birth rates, even the return of corporate control... they don't compare.

You see, almost as soon as the tech was created someone found a way to use it against others. With each doubling of an emulated brain's bit rate time is slowed by half, and with each new advance in vr tech new capabilities emerge within fabricated worlds. It's not just about changing reality according to your whims; every day people invent entirely new sensations as they wire their brains in new and interesting ways. A man famously simulated throwing himself into a black hole just to see what it felt like. Quickly, perhaps as soon as the tech was ready, someone used nb technology as a torture device. For an estimated 70,000 - 112,000 years in virtual time (which lasted only a few days in real time) a group of 119 people were held hostage in an emulated reality consisting of nothing but a black void and constantly repeating intervals of the worst pain sensations available in vr tech at the time. Complete sensory deprivation... except for the pain... for that long... they were all technically braindead upon their eventual release.

This emerging form of torture is presumably being used to this day, and with increasing nb rates there are probably people out there being held to the whims of psychopaths for millions of years of virtual time. Add to that the possibility for psychological torture and all the new and varying sorts of pain available and you have the most fearsome tool for oppression ever concieved. We call such torture 'void death', and the new wave of neo-corporatists scrambling to fill the power void left by an apathetic world society are certainly willing and ready to use this new nuclear option wherever they see fit.

At last, mankind has discovered a way to harm itself which transcends even death, and I'm increasingly convinced that I'm one of it's victims. ",nosleep,tacotacotacotaco,/r/nosleep/comments/g8qnj/at_last/
72,Ever see a strange animal/thing at your window with black eyes?,1300769370,"I am 22 years old and still live at home (in college.) So a couple years ago, when I was still in high-school, I one night decided that I would go downstairs to get a drink of water.

My house is very long and thin, so each room has many windows on both sides of the way. So when we sleep, our house is usually pitch-black downstairs with just small lights on. 

While I was walking around making my way to the kitchen in the dark, I looked out the back of the house and saw something out there. Due to the way my furniture is laid out, I had to snake around the kitchen table which obstructed my view from this window for a little while. When I was able to see it again, there was a white face in the window with just black spots for eyes. They were deep black and the face looked like it had more of a downward dog-snout than a face. Its eyes were about the size of golf-balls and just a very dark black contrasting the white of its face. I stared at it not moving. I wasn't 'frozen' but at the same time, I also wasn't able to flee. I looked at it, studied it and it just had the exact look, unmoving. 

I then moved quickly back around the furniture and upstairs as quick as I could. I didn't glance back.

Two kickers to this story... 1. The window is a good 8 feet off the ground. There is an air-conditioner directly below it, but you'd need to be an acrobat to get on-top of it. and 2. I was browsing the internet a year or so ago and I came across a picture (maybe one of you guys have seen it) It was the same kind of face I described only in a bathroom window above a shower, I believe. I saw it and chills hit me HARD. It either looked IDENTICAL to the thing I had seen, or pretty damn close. I went so far as to try to research the picture, but could find nothing. I don't think it was an ""alien"" or anything crazy like that; however, it was still unlike anything I'd ever seen.

EDIT: After reading some comments, I know it was not: an animal (we get opossums. Trust me, I'd have known what one looks like.) However, the one reference to 'The Rake' disturbs me to a level I cannot describe. I feel that it was it.... The location, time period I saw it, etc. fits almost flawlessly... However, that means that it traveled (or there are more than one) from New York State to Pennsylvania.

73,So... When I was little I would make faces in the Mirror.,1300768164,"Now... Let me start with I always like to make faces in the mirror. I don't know why, but every so often even today (I'm 22 now) I still do it.  My house is an old house, made sometime during the civil war. So it comes with all the old creaks and noises of an old house. I've grown to ignore them fairly well. But there were two moments that still give me chills today. This is one of them, I'll post the other story in another post.

My parents have a giant mirror in their room and it has been there as long as I've been alive. Their room has 2 entries: one in the back (leading to a staircase, bathroom and spare-room), and one into a hallway that links my sister's room and my room.  The giant mirror was placed next to the hallway door and on the exact opposite room than the back-door. 

I believe I was in 2nd or 3rd grade when it was only my older sister and myself home. My parents had just left and I was bored, so I decided to bum around the house and just generally do nothing. When I was walking through my house, I had to pass through my parent's room. When I was walking through, I stopped and looked into the mirror and began making faces. Smiley faces, anger faces, sad faces, I must have been there for a good 10 minutes or so when something behind me caught my eye.

In the hallway behind me (the one that linked the spare room to the bathroom and stairs.) a gray figure moved quickly from over my left shoulder to down where the stairs are located. I froze. This character was approximately 5-6 feet tall and looked like it was wearing a cloak. Think one of those 'grim reaper' Halloween costumes only gray and tattered. I couldn't see its hands, but it definitely had arms, legs and a head... As it passed, it turned and looked at me. I could see some resemblance of a face, but the details are fuzzy. (It was a WHILE ago.) I immediately turned around, but it had already passed. Instead of being ballsy and running after this thing. I lost. my. shit. I ran to my sister's room (out the opposite exit) and slammed my hands on the door like crazy. She opened up and I ran and cowered on her bean-bag chair till my parents came home. I was too panicked to accurately describe what I just saw or even explain why I was freaking out. 

 I don't know if I hallucinated or what. It was too vivid and detailed to mistake it. I stared RIGHT into its face and it turned to look at me. Whatever it was, I didn't feel threatened or anything. It was just like whatever it was was going on its business and it had a reaction of ""oh look, you."" Still scared the piss out of me though...

79,On the inside of the pomegranate ,1300751116,"i found a tiny harp. It was not a joke. There was not a poet around, scrawling down the complex angles the wrinkles on my face adjusted to at the sight of it. Watercolor pigeons in the wallpaper stared at me with a sternness in their eyebrows, daring me to touch the instrument. It felt wrong. The way you would imagine finding your child hood dog dead on the side of the road, then going up to it, placing your fingers inside the wetness while its marred teeth stay in a snarl forever.

The seeds slid around my fingertips and I braced my weight against the marble counter. I made contact.

Nothing exploded. Nothing ripped my foot off at the ankle like when my grandmother was searching for starfish underwater at the beach. 

It's beside the point, but have you ever seen a wave of blood? Have you ever smelled one The question mark has been omitted due to its slight resemblance to a foot. A foot I do not want to remember.

I was always hesitant to eat them in the first place, knowing Hades curse the Greeks thought he placed on them long ago, each seed consumed drawing Persephone into hell for another month. I eat one anyway. 

The harp gave no fight when I removed it from the fruit. My mother would have loved it, always liking classical instruments. The thought of her putting it there did not ease the strangeness caused by its presence. Washing it off it a strainer helped me relax. The bottom of the harp said made in China, and I felt better thinking this was some kind of logical mixup, a sliver of random chance and not something else. I sat down at the table and plucked one of its strings. It felt like shark teeth making my skin their home. Something rolled through my veins into my head, swishing a knife tail into one of my memories.

My mother warned me of this. Of what a harp was meant to do, that it was meant to bring your memories to life. 

I feel a mouth attach itself to my hippocampus, a deformed cashew containing everything I am, though I had always hoped it would grow into a tree, something more. My feet were wet. Water poured out over the table, its source being the small instrument. With only one sense showing me this I could have said it was not real. But there is the sound of its slap against the tile. My socks are no longer dry. I can smell a monster. The water rapidly rises and the scent thickens. It is perfume. 

I begin to regret eating that seed. A paisley dress snakes through the water around the kitchen table. Something is inhabiting it. I jump on the table, knock over the harp. It spews its rain against my cabinets. This memory, my grandmother screaming as something from another world took something from hers. I know what is going to happen. 

But what surfaces is not a shark.

What slaps its bulk onto the table is not my grandmother.

Teeth grind and lunge for my foot. And there is laughter. So much laughter. Laughter like when I splashed in that red wave as a child. Laughter full of stained salt water, gargling it to savor the inner-tube hemoglobin riding inside it. My ten year old arms claw at the wood. Nightmare in my eyes as the younger me grabs what Da Vinci called a masterpiece, all twenty six bones and five toes.

I am on  my back and I am standing.

I am still laughing.

I am shoving it into my maw.

I am laughing so hard.

Laughing 

so 

.....

ha...

...ha..rd.

80,A film shoot gone horribly wrong - Part 1,1300749851,"I watched the entire [Marble Hornets](http://www.youtube.com/user/MarbleHornets#p/u/38/Wmhfn3mgWUI) series, after it was posted a few weeks ago by someone else. It reminded me of was a film shoot I was on many years ago where the director flipped out in a similar manner.  I've been recalling events from this shoot ever since.

Please forgive any glaring errors in my narrative, as watching Marble Hornets made me drink to soften the impact of what I'm about to write - I'm sort of drunk at the moment.  I had blocked out most of this, but it's coming back to me now.  All names have been changed.

Also, I'm sorry if it comes across as a fictional narrative, as that's my writing style – I do write horror screenplays, so dialogue is my big thing.  I assure you, while the dialogue may not be completely accurate (but it's as close as I can remember, with more coming back to me the further I get into the story), the story is absolutely true.

It all happened shortly after Blair Witch was released and became a smash hit.  I and several others had already, even before Blair Witch was released, been mulling over thoughts of a ""reality horror"".  Seeing the success of Blair Witch, we were hoping to ride some coattails, being from the same general area, and having several long known haunting/scary stories from the area to back us up.  This must have been the summer (August or so) of 1999 or 2000 – I can't quite remember.

The tale we were looking to tell was roughly a middle ground between Blair Witch and Marble Hornets - a paranormal story that was less about overall horror for a group, but exploring paranormal terror for those few that were related to the events spawning the terror.  The details of the story we were looking to tell are inconsequential, as the reality of the shoot is far more bizarre.

We planned to do it in the same style as Blair Witch, with the cast filming their own footage, and the crew basically being responsible for setting up the scares.

Unbeknownst to the cast, we, as the filmmakers, had singled out three members from the ten person cast to be haunted.  The other seven often experienced the same events, but were not the victims.

The entire cast and crew booked three weeks of campsite use out in the Appalachian forests (mostly in Savage River State Forest in western Maryland, not far from where Blair Witch was shot), with cast never knowing the location of the crew campsite.  The cast was chosen for those that would be jumpy and scared, thus making for a better film.

Anyway, enough background.  On to the story.

Once we started casting, I was part of the casting process.  We ended up casting mostly random people from the local community colleges (and a few others that we found through Craigslist) – none of them knew any of the crew outside of myself and my girlfriend at the time who helped with casting.  Once we entered production, I was the lead on the ""scare team"", setting up the events that would further the story and scare the shit out of the cast.

The first week went beautifully.  Deep in the woods, incredible footage, many scares, even though we had barely gotten started.  It was definitely A-list material.

The second week is where things started to get strange.

It started off easily enough.  The first couple of days that week, the director would show up with new and even more sinister ways of scaring the cast.  Now, we considered our shooting week to be Sunday through Saturday.  It was on Tuesday that shit started getting weird with the director.

We were planning for a great daytime scare of the cast finding bloodied bones, and hearing some odd noises in the distance.

That day, as we were circling the cast, hidden in the woods (and providing the odd noises), the director (Chris, from here on out) broke out into a fit mid-shot.

""What the fuck are we doing?"" he shouted.  ""This isn't how it goes!  The spirits murder their first victim in broad daylight... NOW!""

As he was the director, we did our best to modify the shot.  Of course, with his outburst, the cast's ignorance of our location was lost.

His outburst was highly uncharacteristic of him, but the rest of us chalked it up the stress of making a movie.  We tried to move the cast in a direction that would set up the possibility for the scare (and restore the atmosphere of the cast not knowing who or what was out there).

After about two hours of misdirection, low-level scare gags, and manipulation of the cast, we finally got the gag, and escorted cast member #1 off the set in bloody tatters (and do you know how hard it is to set up real-time gore effects?  I really commend our makeup artist!) - also the first to be ""murdered"" was not one of the originally intended victims - Chris had made the call.

Later in the shoot, Chris whispered to me, ""Have you ever heard of the name 'Ereshkigal'?""

I answered in the negative.  The name was not familiar to me.

82,"""her finger nails are completely gone from scratching at the walls yet she still seems to be biting at them.""",1300738588,"You know the feeling, you're fast asleep one second then the next you're sitting up right in your bed, frozen with fear. It all began after a work related trip to the Ukraine. I work with a company that requires me to make frequent trips in and out of the country, but this one was different. 
It was a small town along the coast of the Black Sea called Ochakov, fairly old place with a very superstitious community. I stayed at a local motel, I'd tell you the name but it escapes me now (keep in mind  the language in Ukraine is tricky to grasp  especially when you have North American roots). My motel was not far from where our office was located, maybe 15 minutes of a walk which I would do frequently. It was a regular evening, walking back to the motel through a well lit street with many small boutique stores, I guess you could call it ""Downtown"". Accompanied by fellow co-workers I felt safe, they were insisting I join them at a local pub for a beer and being the odd one out, I agreed. Next to the pub I noticed a small shop with the lights still on, I encouraged everyone to go in and that I'd join them shortly. The store had a cozy antique vibe, and being a sucker for knickknacks and unique trinkets I was tempted. I pulled the door open to be greeted by a very distinct smell, if you're familiar with Super Hit incense you know what I'm talking about. Inside, there were shelves upon shelves stacked with old books, small religious idol figurines, jewelry, long silk scarfs, all very mesmerizing. Walking thorough the isles and trying to look at everything, I didn't even notice an elderly lady sitting behind the counter with a hookah hose pressed to her lips, ""Hello"" she muttered, this made me jump back almost knocking a shelf over, ""I'm so sorry, I didn't see you there!"" I manage to say while trying to regain my composure. She exhales a cloud of smoke looking at me intently, to be honest I was taken back by the fact she spoke English but none the less, I was starting to feel uncomfortable with the silence, ""Are you closed? The door was open so I---"" she raised her hand as if she was trying to shoosh me, I let my words trail off. She then motioned for me to kneel in front of her, at this moment I can't tell you what force on Earth made me comply but it happened, I was now sitting across from her with what I can only imagine as a very puzzled look on my face. She begins to speak in broken English, ""Let me see your left hand."" Of course, I'm excited! A real gypsie woman (only a speculation) wanted to read my palm so I hold out my left hand for her to see. She tells me about my future, my life line, love line, ect... nothing very interesting but this is where it gets weird. Up until this very moment she hasn't touched me once, I guess her sight must have been failing her but she gently reached for my hand in an attempt to bring it closer to her face, as soon as her hand made contact with mine she gasped and threw herself back, away from me. My reaction is naturally to lean toward her to help her but the fear in her eyes started to freak me out, ""Are you ok?"" I manage to say, she then darts upwards and starts offering me rings, bracelets, hats, scarf violently throwing random objects at me screaming, ""take it! take it!"". At this point I've had enough, I turn to make a break for the door but she manages to snatch me by the wrist and I make a sudden unexpected stop, I turn to her and try to yank my hand away, ""Let me go!"" she gets down on her knees and starts begging me to take something, anything. I feel totally sick, seeing an elderly woman on her knees begging and crying made me just want to get the hell out of there so I grab a small golden box, throw $20 on the ground and run like hell.
At this point I'm too shaky to go to the pub and I make my way back to my motel room slipping the box into my coat pocket. 

Next day,
I awake not remembering how I got to my room, my feelings are mixed as I wonder what the fuck happened, did I drink? No - It starts coming back to me: the pub, the store, the eldery lady, ...the box. The Box! I leap towards my coat that's on the floor and fumble around looking for the box, nothing. Puzzled, I being to wonder if I'm going insane, not being able to explain something rationally always made me feel uneasy so I try to shrug it off. I try to clear my mind in the shower but the mental gap is still there, almost mocking me. Then it hits me, like a pound of metal bricks, I was not in my hotel room. Fear, anxiety, sheer terror washes over me as I stand naked in the shower, these feelings over power me enough that I feel my knees get weak - I let myself slump down onto the shower floor, the warm water cascading over my face I take a few deep breaths but it's worthless. I can now hear my heart beating in my ears, pressure growing inside of my head - It's too much, the thought? the millions of thoughts running thought my head, ""Who put me here? Did I black out? Maybe I was drugged..."" I open my eyes to see that I'm sitting in a puddle of blood. It's too much, I can now only hear my hear thudding and the pressure grows in my head then blackness falls.


I awake not opening my eyes, again - not knowing how I got there. I feel something pounding on my head, maybe a blunt tool? a bat? How am I still alive? I manage to open my eyes to find I'm on the same bed I woke up in, with a headache of a very large magnitude. I manage to drag myself to the side of the bed, the world spinning around me and I vomit violently. I attempt at easing the pain by pressing my hands very hard at the sides of my temples but more pain washes over me, I cringe and let out a loud cry. It was the kind of pain that makes your teeth throb and your vision to blur, I must have passed out again because I awoke up-right in my bed, frozen with fear. 

It became apparent, the more I looked around the room the more I realized that It was not mine. My bags were missing, clothes, make-up, the only things I had were what I was wearing last. It gets worse, there is no door out. Yea that's right - In fact! there is no front door, no windows, not any indication of me being above or below ground.
Panic is an understatement of what I felt, I cannot think of a word that's haunting enough that could compare. 
I lose it, completely - I find myself looking though the eyes of a crazy person; shes throwing herself against the walls, weeping, screaming for her mother, pulling the hair out of her head, she lost it - poor girl.

I can see her sitting in the corner, weeping quietly, talking to someone that's not there, ""Come here, Kitty... please come here, let me hold you one last time."" She pauses to look around then continues, ""Hey Baby, I'm going to be a little late I got held up at work. Make sure you feed the kitties!"" she then fabricates a beep and pretends to hand up a phone. 

More sobs, more screaming, more begging and finally silence. Finally I can sleep.

Awake! ...I think. Now I can no longer tell weather it's day or night, spring or summer, a dream or reality. Time is no longer my friend, in fact time no longer exists. I stand up, look around at the four walls around me, I wonder where my boyfriend is and if he's feeding the cat's. I find comfort in walking to and from the bathroom re-enacting pleasant experiences in my life, yeah - that time he brought me a blue rose, that one time I played that show and everyone cheered, that time when we moved out and the freedom that came with it... that freedom. I can see her again, walking around endlessly for what seemed like hours, the poor girl; her finger nails are completely gone from scratching at the walls yet she still seems to be biting at them, I begin to feel sorry for her.

83,My first story of Brookrun Insane Asylum.,1300735487,"Brookrun Mental Hospital was a state operated institution located in Dunwoody, GA. In 1998, it closed its doors due to many accusations of patient abuse and general negligence coupled with a new law that privatized all mental health institutions in the state. Brookrun opened its doors one final time and released the pressure on the insanity valves. Hundreds of mentally ill patients were left to rot on the streets of Atlanta. At least the ones who could walk.

There were several confirmed reports of former patients being left behind for several days after the hospital officially closed. Though none of them died, they were found when the building was being cleaned out by employees of the state. They were covered in unexplained bruises and burns. However, several people did die in this building throughout the years and some claimed to see their ghosts for many years after.

Not too long prior to being closed down, a fence was put around the decently sized complex and it was near impossible to enter without a pair of bolt cutters or an affinity to scratches caused by climbing barb wire fences.

The reason for the intense security measures was due to the fact that the SWAT team began using the infamous 'D' building in the back of the complex to practice raids. At night, one could heard the faint sound of pops from gunshots in the nearby suburbs that emanated from Brookrun.

After a good year or two, the fences were rife with holes cut by a variety of local teens looking to engage in a myriad of activities. Some went to make out and fingerblast their high school sweetheart, some went with their cameras and crowbars for that adrenaline rush and those members of the social pariah went to practice demonic worship and witchcraft.

The first story I heard about Brookrun was when I was around twelve years old and the place was still heavily under lock and key. My sisters then boyfriend had broken in and told me about a building that was a tall tower with three stories to it. As it turned out, it had three stories that went straight down into the ground to high security confinement spaces for the criminally insane. Upon reaching the bottom floor, he found a small room surrounded by locked doors, and right in the middle of it was a giant pallet of purple Gatorade. 

Some years later, Brookrun became the place that I frequented. The fences were all torn down, the SWAT force gave up trying to keep kids out and moved training locations (too many worries of lawsuits if some dumb kid wound up getting blown away). A dog park was put somewhere in the midst of the old asylum and one could go as far back as the 'D' building, which was off limits to the public, no less.

History would repeat itself though and within no time, teenagers had cut through the fences and sneaked into the massive 'D' building. They'd kept the place in relatively good shape considering they were teenagers, built a skate park and even took the time to use a saws all to grind out all the rebar stumps that made it impossible to skate safely.

When I wasn't frequenting the 'D' building, I would walk around the park looking at all the mold covered, rotting stone benches representative of pagan altars, the old bathrooms that had been boarded up and the seemingly pointless former administration buildings.

Brookrun has now been turned into Lianne Levitan Park at Brookrun and the old 'D' building was torn down. It really was extremely sad to see it go and I did actually cry when I came back from military school, ecstatic to see the place I'd met so many weird friends and find a bulldozer plowing through the cafeteria. But, for those who loved it, it will always be Brookrun, and we will always brag about being the last to visit its eerie confines and haunting scenery.

I have many more stories to share about it, all of them creepy and terrifying, unexplainable and odd.

Edit - Here is an aerial view of the [grounds.](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=brookrun+park&amp;aq=&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=34.450489,86.572266&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=brookrun+park&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=33.930182,-84.301663&amp;spn=0.002203,0.005284&amp;t=h&amp;z=18) This is where the D building used to be.

84,Skin like soot and a smile that could light the room,1300729832,"For some odd reason, when I take small naps or get awoken and fall back asleep, I always get the strangest dream. It has been a while since my last sleep paralysis dream or anything too horrifying but this morning that changed. 

I woke up from the television this morning around 6 30 a.m. and decided to fall back asleep since I had two more hours until my class started. When I closed my eyes, I instantly fell asleep and awoke in a dream world where I was in a hotel. For reasons unknown, I was in a creepy basement of the hotel with some employees of the hotel. All of the workers paid no attention to me, not even looking up at me when I pass by, and just kept to their sweeping and mopping jobs. I decided to head back up to the upper levels of the hotel and started heading to an elevator. One of the employees stopped their job and followed me into the elevator. As I walk into the elevator, I notice there is no lights on at all and the space is incredibly small. I shrug it off and walk in. As I face the door, I notice the other employee get in and something else following quickly behind him. The something else was a frail man whose skin was black as soot and the only thing I could see was a huge, blinding grin. Not the happy cartoonish grin, but a grin that says ""I want to eat your flesh"". Next thing I know, the dark figure reaches his hand into my heart. I am shocked and paralyzed. He pulls his hand away from my heart but leaves it on my chest, somehow still paralyzing me. I try to push him away but like all my dreams, I am too weak to do anything. All I can do is stare into the mans devilish grin as the doors slowly close.

After the doors close, I am jolted awake and zapped out of my dream. My body is shaking uncontrollably and my heart has a sharp pain in it. I was entirely creeped out and did not want to go back to sleep. Luckily, it was daylight so it was not as scary as it would be if it was in the middle of the night. The dream is not overly scary compared to other people's experiences but something about how I woke up just really freaked me out.",nosleep,ThePrinceofBelAir,/r/nosleep/comments/g8c06/skin_like_soot_and_a_smile_that_could_light_the/

I even turn on my voice recorder on my iphone and leave it on recording while I sleep, and then play it back the next day. Listening for anything errie and scary...I found out I snore a lot sometimes lol.

But sometimes I hear random thumps in my apartment. Kind of scary.

86,Last night: The Hum,1300719208,"Last night I went to sleep. It was a normal Sunday night and I had no reason to suspect anything was wrong, there was nothing out of place and my house was quiet. I was the last one to go to sleep, my mother and my brother were already sleeping, and I was very tired since I had had to drive for about two hours to get home that night. I got into bed and fell asleep almost immediately. 

I remember dreaming but I cannot specify what the dream was about. All I know is that it wasn't your standard screaming nightmare. I remember something uncomfortable about it though, even if I can't recall exactly what was it about. The thing is I woke up with a start at some point throughout the night. It was dark outside and, consequently,  my room was also in complete darkness, so I knew at once it wasn't my normal waking hour. I tried to go to sleep again, blaming my sudden consciousness to a half-remembered bad dream but I just couldn't fall asleep: there was something that wasn't right about my surroundings.

Up to that moment I hadn't opened my eyes properly so I didn't know what time it was or if there was something wrong with my room. But that's exactly what I felt, I felt like there was something wrong with my room. At first I couldn't quite put the finger on what but then I knew: it felt like there was someone else in the room besides me. This feeling started to get worse and I knew I wouldn't be able to open my eyes now. I must admit, I even got under my covers, shut my eyes completely and laid as quietly as possible waiting for whatever it was to go away.

I was in the middle of this, when I heard a loud snap outside my window, like someone had broken a tree branch in half. Obviously this almost made me jump to the ceiling but I knew I was being watched and I couldn't risk getting caught so I just clenched my teeth and tried to keep quiet. It was at that precise moment that the hum began. If you've ever heard the fridge electric motor kick in in the middle of the night, you'll have some idea as to what this sound was like. It was like the fridge motor but a lot louder, it felt as if someone had just turned on a huge electric motor of some kind outside my window. 

I knew at once it wasn't my fridge as I sleep in a third floor and the kitchen is on the ground floor so I began to look for some sort of explanation but not one could account for this obviously electrical hum (I live in a quiet neighborhood and there are absolutely no cars at that hour): there was some sort of machine down there but I didn't feel like looking, in fact I didn't feel like leaving the cover of my sheets as I still felt something or someone watching me intently.

At last, after what I felt were hours the humming stopped, it just cut off suddenly and just like that I felt the fear lift off from me. I was still very much scared but at least I didn't have that feeling of someone watching. I gathered some courage from what was left of my soul and lifted the covers. Everything was dark, but it was also quiet and I dared to turn on the the lamp on my nightstand. My room became light and I could see the time: 3:20 am. I looked around but everything was OK and I sighed relieved. My adrenaline was still flowing so I couldn't go to sleep till almost 4 am so I just laid there waiting for the sleep to come for some time.

Some minutes prior to 4 am I heard the hum again but know it was just a faint buzz, as if it had moved some miles down the road. This time it wasn't that scary and I managed to finally fall asleep. In the morning I woke up at my normal hours, but I was still tired from the night before. I took a shower to wake me up, changed, had my breakfast and, as I was getting ready to leave, I noticed my mother hadn't come down from her bedroom.

Fearing the worst I went to look for her, she was in her bed an I woke her. She told me how she was very tired because she had awakened in the middle of the night and was unable to go back to sleep for some time. Feeling a strange fear in the back of my head I asked her at what time did she wake up. She told me she had woken up at 3 am.",nosleep,cepherias,/r/nosleep/comments/g87tm/last_night_the_hum/

88,UFO Sighting,1300691581,"Bah, I can't sleep so I figure I'll share an experience that my mother and I had when I was in 4th grade.  

I was camping with a friend and his family in the Lake George area of New York, and towards the end of the week my mother and sisters came to pick me up in order to go to a family vacation for the following week.  As we were driving West on the thruway, I was looking out the window and I spotted a strange hovering oval a few miles away over the tree line.  It was around 2pm.  My two younger sisters were sleeping in the backseat, but I pointed out the shape to my mom.  She also saw it.

It was metallic silver and was slowly moving back and forth.  We couldn't believe our eyes.  It dipped below the tree line for a few minutes and when it reappeared there were two of them.  They began moving higher into the sky and started glowing bright gold.  They were moving in large circles in the sky.  I have no idea if they were generating the golden glow or were just reflecting the sun, but either way it was something astonishing to behold.  

When we got to the family vacation, no one believed us.  They said we made it up or just mistook another object.  Even if both my mother and I were unable to identify a simple common man-made flying machine, I'm pretty sure that still fits the definition of ""UFO"".  What we saw was definitely very strange, and if it is man-made, then the public sure as shit doesn't know about it.

89,The floating sandal,1300686367,"One day when I was around ten years old, I walked into my living room and there was a sandal, floating, mid fucking air. My heart skipped a beat and a red hot fear began to overtake me. I couldn't move from where I was standing.

I kept trying over and over to comprehend what I was looking at, thoughts racing through my mind, and then I approached it, slowly. One step after the other as I neared whatever invisible, ghostly force was holding that fucking Teva sandal up and it was sinister. What type of non sinister ghost would hold a fucking Teva up?!

Finally, I was standing in its domain, it was now part of me, I was in the spirit, literally. I crouched down and with the knife edge of my hand, went to feel under the sandal. Turns out that someone had put the sandal on top of a glass and the sun reflecting through one of the windows made it invisible. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g80cd/the_floating_sandal/

91,Please Leave,1300653544,"This happened a few years ago after a rehearsal dinner for friend's wedding. The dinner was held at a little ""lodge"" (metal shed) in the middle of nowhere Midwest, there was nothing but fields for miles in all directions. This lodge was about 15 miles away from the motel we were all staying at, so we all tried our best to stay sober enough to drive back. The guy I was rooming with had one too many and was told he couldn't drive his car back, but being a drunk a-hole he just slipped outside and took off in his car around 11pm. 

About thirty minutes later I head back to the motel room expecting to find my roomie already sleeping, instead the motel room is empty. I didn't really think much about it, I figured he had found one of the local watering holes and was having some late night fun, so I go to sleep. Around 3AM I get woken up to him finally walking in, I'm ready to give him some hell about drinking so much the night before our buddy's wedding, but I stop when I see him. His face was white he had obviously been crying and he was shaking like a leaf. I immediately ask him what's wrong.

After he had left the lodge he had taken a few wrong turns and had gotten lost down some old gravel roads. He realized it had been a mistake for him to try to drive in his drunken state so he decides to try to find some place to pull off and sleep for an hour or two. After driving for awhile he saw a patch of trees in the distance with a gravel driveway leading up to it. He pulls into the driveway and sees that the patch of trees has a grown over foundation in the middle of it. He figures this would be a good place to rest so he turns his car off and closes his eyes.

He isn't sure how long he was asleep, when he is woken up to a loud tapping on the driver side window. He jumps to attention looks over and sees a woman in her mid-forties wearing a night gown leaning over looking in his window. He thinks that this woman must have been driving by and stopped to make sure he was ok. So he rolls down his window to explain his situation hoping that she won't call the cops. Before he could say anything though, the woman leans through the open window getting so close to his face he could feel her lips on his cheek and whispers ""Please leave"". She then stood up and started walking down the driveway toward the old foundation. He didn't think twice he started his car and reversed out of the driveway. As he's pulling onto the road he looks back down the driveway, where the old foundation had been just seconds before there was now a small farm house, the windows were broken, the exterior was bare wood as if the paint had long worn off, and the roof sagged in the middle. As he tried to wrap his mind around what he was seeing he noticed that staring at him out of a window on the second floor was the woman who had just spoken to him. He put his car in drive and floored it down random gravel roads scared out of his mind until he found the highway and made it back to the motel. 

He left for home the next morning, I had to explain to our friends why one of the groomsmen had to leave. I just told everyone he had caught a bad flu. We don't ever talk about what happened that night.

95,"PLease don't cry, we're all ok.",1300640462,"I work in a hospital, and in a place where death is common, I kind of learned how to just shrug things off and move on. This is different, and  kind of both creeps me out, and brings tears to my eyes. 

A cardiologist at our hospital died a couple of weeks ago. His house caught on fire. His wife, along with their 2 children also died during the accident. All four of them were found in the bedroom hugging each other. 

There's this kid, 7 years old, his doctor was a pediatrician at our hospital, been there a lot actually. The pediatrician was at a loss to with what to do with the kid. He was brought there by his mother, because the kid insisted he has been talking to his father a lot. His father died a couple years ago, and I'm not sure how or why. The pediatrician found nothing wrong with the kid.

A couple of days ago. the kid insisted on seeing his pediatric doctor, he didn't say why, but was persistent. He kept bugging his mom to bring him to the doctor immediately. End of the day, she brings his kid to the hospital. Upon entering, the kid just stopped. In the lobby there was a photo of the deceased cardiologist, with flowers and well wishes. The kid sees it and tugs at his mom, ""That's the guy who talked to me a couple of days ago, he told me to tell [pediatric doctor] not to cry anymore, he said they're all ok and happy. So the mom takes the kid to his doctor, and the pediatric doctor is just , shocked and overwhelmed at the same time. The pediatric doctor was close friends with the cardiologist, and have been in a sad state these past couple of days. 

The part that freaks me out is that the cardiologist never met the kid patient ever. I do believe that science can explain most things, but maybe not everything. If there was an ""I see dead people kid"" in real life, I'd bet that's the kid.

96,White noise,1300630728,"I remember waking up very early in the morning one day wondering what that humming noise was. I looked around bleary eyed and noticed my computer was on. I always switch it off at night. In my state of delirium, I got up and held down the power button, then carried on sleeping. It was only later on that morning that I pondered just how odd it was. Not only was the computer on but it seemed to emit a green glow. I have no LEDs in it either. I brushed it off as brain trickery.

I've always had white noise coming through my speakers. Nothing remarkable. Plenty of people have reported white noise from these speakers. It was just a light buzzing, inaudible over the noise of the computer fans. In recent months since the old green computer incident, some stranger noises have manifested themselves. Sometimes the white noise grows louder. There are a number of things that happen after this.

Sometimes I hear a foreign radio station. I don't know what they're saying. Sometimes the white noise sounds like waves breaking on a beach. Yesterday, I heard a knocking coming from the speakers. This happened three times and then stopped, so I thought no more of it.

Early this morning, I awoke to my computer on again. I instantly recognised that green glow. The bloody thing was up to something. The hard drive was whirring away and I could hear what sounded like muttering from the speakers, still connected to the computer but unplugged for their mains power source. I turned the monitor on and there was a bunch of documents and webpages open. My CV, websites I had been on, bank details, pictures, emails. All being trawled through. I yanked the power cable out of the back of the computer but decided to investigate further in the morning.

I plugged it back in, sat down in front of it and, as is customary, plugged my speakers in. The second they received power, a booming voice escaped from them.

97,Nightmare in to reality,1300629112,"As a long time lurker-/r/nosleep'er I have read many stories. And now I am sharing mine. 

As I was young I had lots of trouble with nightmares. Over the years I grew ""used"" to them, as in ""subconcious, y u no normal"". 
I had really bad ones, where I wake up and my sheets are wet from my sweat. But as I said, I had no sleeping problems. I was 14 when it al started, now almost 24 and still happening.

But this happend:
Few months ago (late late summer 2010), I began having dreams about ghosts. For some reason I didn't feel comfortable with them. Every time I would wake up and notice I had cried, or been moving around in bed (covers gone, pillows on the other side of bed,...).
The dreams became longer, more frightning and I was getting really stressed about it.
I told my gf about it. She knew about my past nightmares and calmed me down and trying to reason with me why and how.
Then for a few weeks nothing happend. I slept, no dreams or the regular nightmare. Until one day.

I was working from 7am-3pm. So I get in bed early (10-11pm) I was feeling a bit strange, but dismissed it as I had just had my previous hours of work (3pm-11pm) and was verry tired switching.
I fell a sleep pretty quick. And then the ghost nightmare happend again. This time verry clear.
in dream:There was this woman standing over my bed, face comming closer and closer. Then she suddenly reached out and pushed something on the shelf above my head. (I have this shelf above my bed on my head end) 
Out of dream: I wake up because I felt something ""touching"" me in real life. At that exact same moment, me waking up and the feeling of touching, this cardbord box (5cm by 1cm by 10cm) fell down on my pillow, less than 1cm away from my face. I jumped up, verry frightend. Put it back on the shelf, and then notice it couldn't have come down without taking birthday cards, and some papers with it. It was leaning against the wall as I can remember. But it came down alone.
Didn't sleep that night. Talked to my gf about it. She didn't take it serious, like al the other nightmares were just dreams. But this did feel verry real. 
The only reason it could have fallen was because my window was open, and maybe a breeze blow it down, but there were much lighter stuff on there that remaind in their position.

1 month later I had to get a bowl surgery. Right after that, the ghost dreams stopped.
I moved out of my parents house last month , and the nightmares are moving away to. I sleep better and I feel better.

But still, the ghost dreams still gives me goosebumps when I think of them.

98,Supermoon...,1300617747,"3:00am, right on the nose.  I sat bolt upright.  I had fallen asleep on the couch while doing a puzzle online.  The TV still played the DVD menu of the movie I had been watching, music repeating over and over.  I turned off the TV, and the room was suddenly shrouded in darkness, only the light from the screen of my laptop glowing.  Tonight was the night of the ""supermoon"", and the light shining through my drawn blinds was brighter than normal.  Thinking nothing of it, I went upstairs and got in bed.

Once I got into bed, my mind started running wild.  The light coming through my bedroom window, also with blinds drawn, was much brighter than normal.  Shadows that always existed in my room seemed more defined.  Some even appeared to move.  Not being much of a believer in the dangers of the paranormal, I wasn't exactly scared.  I had, however, spent too much time observing my stranger-than-normal surroundings, and was quite awake.  I needed to get back to sleep.

I got out of bed and ventured back downstairs to retrieve a bottle of rum I had been sipping on before falling asleep.  I grabbed the bottle, took a sip, and headed back upstairs to crawl back into bed.  I hoped the rum would help me overcome my new-found insomnia, and get back to sleep.

I felt tired, but still couldn't manage to get back to sleep.  My mind drifted off towards thoughts of slenderman and other creepy and terrifying things I've read on here.  The vivid, moving shadows didn't help my mind to find rest.

Then it was 4am.  I was still quite awake, mind still musing over terrifying tales.  Eyes playing tricks on me - seeing figures that weren't there.  Such visions were quickly dispelled by my logical mind.  Either way, I knew I wasn't getting back to sleep any time soon.  I got back out of bed and went downstairs.  Reading some reddit should help to soothe my mind and get me ready for sleep again, right?

As soon as I laid down on the couch, I knew that I wasn't in the mood for the general reddit communities.  My mind seemed determined to try and scare me, so I started browsing /r/creepy.  You know, give the human imagination its fix of what it wants...

After about 20 minutes of reading /r/creepy, I went outside to have a cigarette (I'm trying to quit, so I don't smoke in the house).  The rear of my house backs up to the main street through the neighborhood.  Usually, there are street lights lining the road, but tonight, two of the three immediately out back were off, and instead the road and the surrounding townhouses were illuminated by the moon alone.  The supermoon.

As I stood outside smoking, I surveyed my surroundings.  One thing caught my eye - a figure, exactly opposite me on the other side of the road, completely cast in shadows, appeared to be staring at me.  I took a drag off of my cigarette, and noticed the familiar glow of cigarette embers from the shadow across the street.  ""Just another insomniac like me, smoking a cigarette,"" I mused to myself. ""Nothing to worry about.""  I looked away.

A few moments later, I looked back.  The shadow was now standing on the sidewalk on my side of the street, between me and my white work van.  He should have been at least slightly illuminated at this point, as I could clearly see the logos and text printed on the side of my van.  The figure was still completely in shadow, though - nothing more than a human shape.  I took another drag.  So did the shadow.  I looked at it curiously for a few moments, and took another drag from my cigarette.  So did the figure.

Surely, my mind must have been playing tricks on me, between the insomnia and the alcohol.  I looked away again.  A car drove down the street.  I looked back, and the figure was gone.

I finished my smoke, and turned to head back inside, feeling a little creeped out, but still not really scared.  I extinguished the butt on the brick wall outside of my back door, dropped the butt in the pot I had for just such a purpose, and opened the door to go back inside.  As I went back inside, I cast a glance over my shoulder, back to where the shadow was, and saw him standing at the top of the hill in my back yard, not 15 feet from me.  There were now two glowing embers where his eyes should have been.

I rushed back inside, locking the door up tightly behind me.  I returned to the couch, still trying to convince myself that my mind was playing tricks on me.  My mind wanted to scare me so bad?  Let's give it what it wants.  I started reading /r/nosleep.  After reading a story or two, my eyes glanced back towards the window, which had the blinds drawn.  There were a few slits of light being allowed through in places where the blinds hadn't quite settled into place properly.  There were two red, glowing embers peering through one of the slits.

Oh shit.  Come on, mind.  I know you love dwelling on things like this, but come on, enough is enough.  I looked away for a moment, and then looked back.  The embers were gone.

Now, I can hear scratching from within the walls.  It doesn't sound like bugs or mice.  They're both common around here, and I'm quite familiar with the sound they make.  No, this sounds more... human... like fingernails slowly being dragged down painted drywall.  I sit here writing this as the scratching gets louder.  I don't know what to make of it.

Oh shit.  The embers.  They're here.

**Edit:** I don't remember anything between posting and just now when I woke up and took this photo.  I was just about to grab another smoke when I noticed this scribed into the dust on my television.

0,The First Visitor,1300612917,"This is very short since I don't want to elaborate on the truth, this is just what happened.  A small incident, but strange and creepy nonetheless.

I have a pet ferret who is free roaming - she isn't caged, and can go where she wants to in the flat.  For fun, she has a long duct tube (the kind used for air conditioning - [like this](http://fridgetech.com/lg_airconditioning/in_ceiling_ducted/images/tech_therm_400_flexi_duct.jpg)) to run through along the corridor to my bedroom.  It's quite noisy when she scuttles down it.

Some time ago I woke in the early hours and heard her run into my bedroom and under the desk and the bed, scuttling and scratching around for a while.

*While the scuttling noises were still going on*, I heard another set of footsteps running noisily down the duct tube towards my bedroom.

I freaked, turned the light on, and saw my ferret inside the end of the tunnel, not in the room yet.  The noise under the bed had ceased.  I did not dare to look under the bed. 

All I know is that we have no rats or mice in the building, and cockroaches and spiders do not make animal feet noises.

2,An old chapel,1300601043,"A little ways past downtown where I grew up, there is a church, where the scout troop that I was a part of met.  I started there in cub scouts, and subsequently attended during Boy Scouts as well.  This was a rather old church, and although it had several new additions, it showed in places.  Specifically in the old chapel  that stood across from the church's cemetery.  If I remember correctly, some of the graves dated back to the civil war.

Back during my first and second years of cub scouts, the building that we met in was a series of classroom-like areas, attached to the back of the old chapel.  There was a new sanctuary that the church used, and the old chapel was being ""repaired,"" although no work seemed to get done.

One night after the meeting, our parents were all outside talking about something or other, a group of guys, myself included decided to check out the old chapel.  We were about 8 or 9 at this time, so we naturally we fabricated this story about the chapel being haunted.  

As we approached the door that lead to the inside, we discovered that it was unlocked.  We opened the door and fell silent.  The door lead to the front of the sanctuary, right behind the altar.  It was pitch black inside, with the light from the hallway we were in barely showing us a few yards inside.  There were a few ladders bits of scaffolding scattered across the area, creating ominous, looming shadowy figures in the blackness.

Due to methods that I can't remember (but were probably unfair), i was elected to step inside first.  I stepped in, trying to act like a wasn't a scared little eight-year-old.  The other guys promptly closed the door behind me.

""Guys? Come on, open up!"" I said, or something to that effect.  I was a bit scared since I couldn't see anything, but I didn't want to sound like it.  I began banging on the door.  ""Hey! Let me out!"" 

I was continually looking over my shoulder. Not like I could see anything.  But I was getting frantic now, since it had been almost a minute, and I couldn't hear anyone on the other side.  I turned around one more time, and...well, I don't know how to say what I saw. 

Red. Just, redness. Some deep, red...THING was floating almost directly above me. It was shapeless, formless...it almost looked two-dimensional.  And it seemed to be shivering. I began banging on the door much harder. ""PLEASE! LET ME OUT!""

I don't know if they heard the change in my tone, or were just done, but they opened the door. I looked up, and the thing was gone.  Of course it was.  After telling them what I saw, no one seemed to believe me.  But then, none of them wanted to check for themselves either.

Nothing else ever came of that event.  Eventually, the old chapel was actually refurbished.  Myself and a few of my friends even had our Eagle Ceremonies inside.  But still...that bizarre, red thing is something that I've never forgotten about.

It's so wonderful to be surrounded by all this talent! Little old me, who can barely play the violin, is sitting among some of the world's greatest musicians. I still can't believe my luck!
Today was great too. I was able to record an entire symphony... Haydn's Symphony No. 3 in d minor. It was so beautiful! I could barely keep up with everyone else in the string section, but they were so nice. They encouraged me instead of being stuffy jerks or something. Best of all, they record all of it and then let you hear yourself play on the studio's speakers. I can't wait until tomorrow... I hear we're doing a piece from Dvorak!


* More of Zoe's Thoughts - 
I've been feeling a little sick lately. Kind of woozy after playing in the studio usually. It gets so stuffy in that place, but it's sure worth it. I know I'm getting better just from watching my fellow violinist's techniques. They don't even mind giving me some pointers. Tonight, a bunch of us girls from the string section are going down to the rec hall for a dance. I hope that cute sound guy Parker asks me to dance. He's dreamy.

While sitting here on my computer browsing AskReddit I hear my young cat in the next room playing with some toys and making a racket as he commonly does. Then, eerie silence. I glance down the hall and I see a shadow of some sort move very quickly into the room my cat is in. I freeze with fear. 

After a few brief moments I find the courage to check on my cat. He is sitting on his back legs with his paws in the air gently swatting at something, his head darting from side to side. This is very unusual behavior for him. He continues this for nearly thirty seconds, unaware of my presence and engaged with something, else.  

He is now sitting very quietly on my bed staring coldly at me while I type this. His pupils are dilated and his body still. 

My skin is crawling and goosebumps come and go. They start on my head and pulsate down my body and run up   my arms.

7,I know what hell is like.,1300584309,"I had a dream about hell.

It was a multi-floor shopping mall with a big hole down through the center of it, I think it was about six or seven stories tall. There were black-cloaked demons roaming around on the ceilings, and every once in a while they would grab someone and rip them apart, screaming. Nobody could die, they just had to wait as their body agonizingly pulled itself back together. This process took between one and seven days, depending on how torn apart they were. The way to avoid the demons was to pretend they weren't there and keep milling around with the rest of the crowd; if you did anything to stand out, they would grab you. Sometimes they would get really close and the people around you would start to freak and stampede. If you were trying to act nonchalant when this happened, the crowd would leave you standing there by yourself, making you an obvious target. So if the crowd started to run, you had to start running too and hope you weren't the one to get singled out. Kind of like a herd of wildebeest. Basically everybody got the shit ripped out of them at least two or three times a month. There was no day or night, just constant fluorescent lighting. I saw one person get caught and chopped to screaming pieces right in front of me by a giant sweaty devil with a double axe. You could always hear people screaming, and everyone was in constant terror.

My wife said I kept swearing in my sleep, but she couldn't wake me up. It felt like I was in the dream for about 4 hours, and I woke up tired.

8,Haunted Childhood Fun,1300577851,"Note: I am terrible at writing (typing?) , my grammar is just the shits, and I may make spelling mistakes. Sorry. I just want to share this experience anonymously!

       I grew up in a small house in Calgary, AB. My family (Mom, Dad, older brother (4 yrs)) had lived in the house about 5 years before I was born. After I was born, my parents got a divorce and my mom took my brother and I and my dad left. My mom got a very good deal on the house as it turns out the previous owner had died in the house, and I guess that deterred most young couples. But my family not having much money, decided it was a great house to raise a family in the area we lived. From ages 3-7 or so (whenever you start having real memories), I don’t remember anything particularly scary happening. I had always had childhood paranoia of hearing cracks and all sorts of weird sounds in my room, but nothing too obvious/scary. 
        When I was around 10 y/o, my Mom and I were having a conversation, and being older and all (lol), I started asking about the house and who lived there before us. She told me the story of the previous owner dying in his sleep, and that he had set-up his main living space in the basement. 
           Now let me tell you about the basement. That place was terrifyingly scary. Had a huge set of creepy stairs going down, once you got into the actual basement, there was a hallway before the main living area in the basement, which leaded to a supply room (furnace room / pantry type thing) and a bed room, and to the other side of the hallway was a bathroom and another bedroom. My Mom had told me that the older-gentleman had passed away in one of the rooms. After finding all this out, being a little kid and not really having a single care in the world, I just brushed it off and went on with my life. 
           Around 11 or 12, I started watching horror movies, which only increased childhood paranoia before bed. The small little creeks and cracks I used to here began to turn into footsteps. Not every night, but occasionally I would hear somebody walking up and down the hallways ( I am getting goose bumps thinking about it right now... oh god), but never a door opening or closing. Everyone in my family slept with their doors closed.
          The one time I had started to realize that ghosts etc weird things might be real were when I had got up to get a glass of water from the kitchen, and when I went in the kitchen every single cupboard drawer, chair, fridge doors etc, every possible thing in a kitchen that could be opened, was open. Once again being a little kid, I casually shut everything and went to bed to dream about Yu-Gi-Ohs or whatever it was.
       Fast forward like 6 months, my mom has an awesome boyfriend and his two sons are now living with us. Jeremy, the youngest of the other brothers (14 or so) was sleeping in one of the rooms in the basement. A few weeks pass, and Jeremy tells both my Mom and Step-father that he had seen an old man downstairs in his underwear, slowly walking in the hallway before the bedroom, back and forth. He said he was too scared to do anything so he put his head under his covers and fell asleep. My step-father was pretty shocked, saying how he didn't want to tell anyone just incase we all got rattled, but he'd also seen an older man walking in just underwear in the basement, sitting on the bed that Jeremy slept in. 
         At this point this is when things got prettttttty weird. I started having extremely terrifying nightmares about a man in a white mask in the basement, almost every single night. I know this is very poorly written, but I have never told anyone any of this, aside from the things which were told to me. I’ve forgotten about it completely, as life goes on, right?

I now live in another province (BC) and have had no such experiences with any haunting (or ghosts) in anyway. The previous experience makes me believe 100% that a spirit can stay in a house and that they are indeed real.

10,Late-night intruder when I was ten.,1300520002,"Between the ages of six and fourteen, my mother and I lived primarily alone. My father had left when I was four and my older brother divided his time between my mother's place and my grandmother's. After my parents' separation, my mother began drinking heavily and it wasn't until several threats were made by child protective services that my mother decided to get sober and rid herself of the alcoholic hanger-ons she had accumulated over the years. The problem was, these alcoholics weren't ready to give up their drinking spot just because my mom gotten clean and for several years they would continue to show up. I can't count the amount of times I would come home from school, let myself into the house, and find a man standing in a dark corner or passed out in my bed. Or worse, to find a broken window and the house trashed. They once chopped apart our kitchen chairs and started a fire in our kitchen and another time I walked in to find a man without any clothes standing over my sleeping mother.

When I was about 10, my mother and I were spending a weekend alone. It was a Friday, well after midnight (we really didn't have bed-time rules but this was late even for me) and my mom and I were sitting in her room, just talking. My mother's bedroom is on the ground floor, overlooks the back yard, and is situated at the far end of the veranda that spans the entire back of the house. This veranda also provides a back entrance into the kitchen - the most used entrance into my house. While talking, we noticed the motion light go on and off several times, illuminating the back deck and shining through her blinds. We assumed it was a stray dog or a skunk. Not uncommon. But then we heard the unmistakable sound of a foot creaking down on the deck. 

We instantly stopped talking and listened as one step creaked, then a second, and a third. Someone was standing on the veranda. A few seconds passed with us staring at one another, waiting. We heard the faint sound of the kitchen doorknob rattle gently, someone pushing from the other side, and then silence again. Fifteen years later, I can still remember my mothers's scared eyes. 

After what felt like an eternity, we heard the deck creak again. But to our horror, the footsteps were walking toward us down the veranda. My mother had her blinds pulled, but as the figure approached, I could make out a faint silhouette slowly stop, turn, and face her bedroom window. We were frozen in place, my heart hammering in my chest, my little ten year old brain completely overwhelmed with the situation, but I distinctly remember whispering, ""If we can see him, he can see us..."" 

A full minute must have passed with us staring at him through the blinds, silently willing him to go away. Finally, he turned and slowly walked off the deck. His absence from the window was surprisingly more unsettling as now I didn't know where he was. Moments later, I knew.

As our nerves started to settle, we decided to risk leaving the bedroom to phone the police. The thought had barely formed before Princess, our aging golden lab whose existence was becoming increasingly limited to our tattered sofa, suddenly began to snarl and bark from the living room at the front of the house. In between the barking, we could hear the front door open without resistance and slowly click closed again as someone entered. I gasped and my mother swore as we both realized that we hadn't locked both doors. 

Princess was crazy, our fierce protector, and I was immediately fearful for her. She could threaten and she could bite, but she could hardly move. Suddenly the barking stopped and I reached out and took my mother's hand. The abrupt silence in the house only intensified the hammering in my head. We waited, our hands slick with sweat and then we heard a noise that made my heart sink. A thud, a quick yelp of pain, a momentary commotion and back to dead silence. 

I leapt off the bed, slammed the bedroom door, and hooked the chain lock my mother had installed after a particular abusive boyfriend made such safety precautions necessary. Facing the door, my body began to shake uncontrollably. Extreme shaking as if I was standing in a frozen lake. My teeth chattered, my eyes watered, my knees shook. I was terrified. My dog was hurt, someone was in the house, and we didn't even have a phone to call for help. 

A floorboard creaked in the hallway leading to my mother's room and we snapped to attention, both going in different directions. Mom ripped open her nightstand drawer and came up with her sewing shears held defensively in front of her. I dove into her closet, scattering her shoes and retrieved a hammer from the small toolbox she kept at the back. It felt heavy in my jelly arms. Tears were streaming down my face, and my mother's frantic, terrorized expression was scarring. We stood facing the door, a few feet away so that we wouldn't be struck if it suddenly flew open, and waited with our weapons held in front of us as the floorboards outside her room were suddenly silent. 

""Oh my God....""  

My mother whimpered as the doorknob slowly turned. A second passed and it turned again, someone trying to push the door inward. My ten year old self was overcome. ""Mom, please!"" I pleaded as the door was pushed again and the knob rattled forcefully. And then mom stepped up. 

""YOU TRY TO OPEN THAT DOOR ONE MORE TIME AND I WILL CUT YOUR FUCKING THROAT!"" My mother bellowed, the scissors clenched in her raised fist. She was shaking, but the ferocity in her wide eyes showed me she meant it. 

The doorknob settled back into place, but he didn't retreat. We stood waiting, both of us vibrating with adrenaline and fear. A minute passed and the doorknob slowly turned again. Admirably calm in delivery, my mom matter-of-factly states,  ""Just try me motherfucker and see.""  

The door shook violently as he repeatedly slammed his fists into it from the other side, starling us both and nearly causing me to drop the hammer. And then abruptly it was over. The footsteps retreated down the hall, through the living room, and out the front door, slamming it behind him. 

When we could breathe again, and were sure they was gone, we left the room and amazingly, Princess wasn't hurt. I assume her tail had been stepped on to cause the yelp, but otherwise, she was fine. The fact that she didn't attack the intruder makes me think she recognized him. 

We never found out who was in the house but it didn't stop. For years, my mom would get phone calls describing what she was wearing that day, or playing unsettling music or movie clips. One night while watching a movie in my living room, I felt like I was being watched through the picture window and then a huge block of ice was thrown through it, landing only a few feet away from my sofa. We've had neighbours mention someone sitting in their car on the street, watching our house, and have seen evidence of people being in and around our windows and doors. And the police have never been able to help. 

The night of the intruder is still unsettling.",nosleep,fiver00,/r/nosleep/comments/g6yh9/latenight_intruder_when_i_was_ten/
11,The poison is a curtain that surrounds your house,1300519862,"100% true story.

When I was younger, I used to stay up late listening to the radio (I'm 29, so when I was in my early teens I didn't have internet). Some of my favorites were shows like Dr. Demento and Love Line (with Dr. Drew and Adam!).

One night in particular I will never forget.

I turned on my large black rounded boombox and began scrolling through the stations using the ribbed wheel on the top of the stereo. I had the volume turned down very low so my parents in the room directly above mine couldn't hear. I had all of the channel locations memorized and could easily turn from one to the next in the appropriate amount of knob turns.

On that night, I passed a channel I never listened to- it was typically B96 or some such (I live in Chicago). This channel was normally some crappy poppy station with house music at night. As I passed the channel I heard voices coming through the radio.

Now let me stop right here and explain what this sounded like because I have never heard anything like it before or since. It wasn't quite whispers- it was more like quietly speaking voices. They were garbled and distorted- but not like a radio distorts. They were distorted as if the voices themselves were being generated by otherworldly creatures- something sounding almost human. Mostly what the voices said were unintelligible, but occasionally I would pick up words here or there.

I was at first confused- rather than scared. I kept expecting commercials to come on. Was it a prank? Some kind of new programming? It was very strange.

So I switched to another channel. I came back to the voices channel a few minutes later and it was still going. I began to grow uneasy. They kept randomly talking and undulating- it was almost disturbingly musical how the chaos joined together.

This went on for almost a half an hour. I was paralyzed by the voices and couldn't decide how to react.

As they would talk, I tried to memorize what they were saying, but only one phrase stuck with me to this day a decade and a half later.

**THE POISON IS A CURTAIN THAT SURROUNDS YOUR HOUSE.**

I have a ground level room and I looked out the window- expecting I know not what.

Eventually the voices stopped and there was radio silence. It was not easy to sleep that night.",nosleep,solidwhetstone,/r/nosleep/comments/g6ygg/the_poison_is_a_curtain_that_surrounds_your_house/
12,Temple Park,1300515454,"I live in north Texas, and I've heard many ghost stories about haunted railroads, ghost towns and witchcraft. I never paid much attention to these stories because I had heard so many..That was until I came across Temple Park.
 Temple park has pretty much everything. My family and I would go there often to grill an sometimes stay out there even minutes before the park closed (11pm). One day, we went out there to grill and play out on the playground but we kids decided to go explore the woods out back. We started while it was still light outside just in case we got lost (it seemed that big to us as kids). So we all headed into the woods excited about the things we might find. We lurked the woods for a while until we reached a small patch of land that had no grass at all. Everyone else headed towards a big tree to climb but something else caught my eye. I looked up towards the trees that surrounded the grassless area and noticed something hanging from the trees. I couldn't tell what it was from where I was standing so I decided to take a closer look. I partially climbed a tree so I could reach the object(s) hanging from the tree. As I got closer, I started feeling afraid. The things that I had seen were dolls! The creepiest fucking dolls I have ever seen.. Because they weren't just any old dolls, these were made with sticks and some sort of string. If you have seen the witch project, you'll know kinda what I'm talking about. These dolls were hanging everywhere! There was even one in the middle of a pile of dirt on the ground. For some reason, I decided to take one down and show my parents to see what they thought. I showed all the kids and most of them thought they were cool, but I just couldn't help feeling afraid. I tried to stay calm thinking maybe it was stupid teenagers that went out there and put those dolls there, but even then, it was fucked up. 
So we all ran back to show our family and as soon as they saw it, their faces filled with horror. My dad told me to drop it exactly where I had found it and to never go play out there again.

EDIT: Here is a picture of a doll that is very similar to the ones I saw. It's not exact though.

13,Ever heard of the Lost Cosmonauts conspiracy? Read this story and try to hear the audio at the end.,1300515321,"After the successful orbital flight of Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet authorities wanted to give a further demonstration of their superiority: Alan Shepard had finally entered space on May 5, 1961, but only for a brief, suborbital flight. The U.S.S.R. would send into orbit the first woman cosmonaut, before the americans could even attempt their first orbital flight. And while the americans were planning one additional suborbital flight before attempting a flight of only three orbits, the russian woman cosmonaut would fly 17 times around the earth. 

The launch took place on the 16th of May, 1961. We don't know what went wrong during the flight, but re-entry had to be delayed. It is possible that the thermal shield of the Vostok capsule may have been damaged during launch. A decision was finally made to attempt re-entry on May 23rd, due to the dwindling air supplies.

The italian listening post manned by the Judica-Cordiglia brothers had, by now, learned how to intercept the voice communications between the spacecraft and mission control, in addition to the physiological data received on the previous missions.
The document we are presenting is dramatic and unsettling: the cosmonaut can be heard complaining about the increasing ambient temperature, in a professional voice which yet betrays the knowledge of a mission gone terribly wrong. In the end, when flames start engulfing the capsule, the voice becomes heart-rending. 

A full english translation is presented, together with the original voice recording.

Three days later, on May 26, 1961, TASS, the soviet press agency announced the return to earth on the 23rd of a large, unmanned satellite which burned upon re-entering the atmosphere. The satellite was the size of a city bus. Its launch had not been previously disclosed and its purpose was unknown.

14,Something in my room. ,1300512021,"This is a true story...

A few years ago my ex-wife and I were staying at a friend's house. We were staying in the guest room while we were there. The next morning after the first night she and I were going to hop in the shower to get ready. She noticed that I had scratches all over my back. She even joked about me being disloyal to her. I pretty much figured that perhaps the bed springs had scratched me up. 

After we hopped out of the shower we noticed in the fogged up mirror there was a perfect non-fogged area that looked like a fireman's ax. That spooked her out a little more and I insisted that it had to be the way the room fogged up. She told me that as long as I was there she wasn't scared.

We did our thing for the day and returned to our friend's house to crash out for the night. We turned out the lights and cuddled up when within a few minutes we heard the toilet lid slam down in the bathroom and the toilet flush. My ex wanted me to check and make sure that it was our friend (who had her own toilet). I opened the door and the hallway was dark. I called my friend's name and she poked her head out of her room. I asked if she was in the bathroom and she said no and she has been in her room all night.

I went back to my ex and told her what happened. Of course she started to get nervous and we stayed up a bit longer to talk. I got her mind off of it with humor and the promise that if it continues we will leave. Eventually she fell asleep. I turned out the lights and went to sleep myself.

I am not sure what woke me but my eyes popped open and right up against the bed on my side there was a male shadow figure looking down on me. Needless to say I was a tad startled but I was not afraid. I reached over to my ex and without taking my eyes off the figure I shook her awake. I asked her ""Can you see it?"" she let out a gasp that that chilled the room and said shakily "" Yes! Oh my GOD!!"" after that the shadow seemed to step back and melt back into the darkness. 

My ex refused to get out of bed and she asked me to turn on the lights and stay up with her until morning. The next day we told our friend what happened and she seemed genuinely surprised. She joked with us about bringing something with us. After a nervous laugh she said she won't be going in that room anymore. We got our stuff together and stayed in a hotel without any further incident after that.  ",nosleep,Invader_Ark,/r/nosleep/comments/g6wyk/something_in_my_room/
15,The Confessions of a Psychic Part 2: A Few Years Later,1300509966,"The following story is that of my moms experience of being a psychic. I have convinced her to let me share some of her experiences with other people by having her write them down, and letting me post them here. I would also like to remind you all that English isn't her first language, so her writing isn't the best, but I cleaned it up the best I could without changing too much.

If you would like to read the first post, you can read it [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g5q1m/the_confessions_of_a_psychic_part_1_first_vision/)

This is her story.

""This one happened a few years later after my neighbor moved away. The new people that moved in was a single mother, with a son and a daughter. Since I live on what we call “town housing”, I babysat a lot of kids on my street, so I ended up babysitting the new kids too. I was babysitting Danny, and Lisa on a Saturday afternoon and I was watching TV with Lisa.

Danny was outside riding his bike with his friends. Danny was about seven years old if I remember correctly. Anyway, Danny was outside and some reason this vision came to me. I was seeing Danny riding his bike around the curve further up the street. Danny and his friends were racing back home and all of a sudden Danny’s feet came off the pedals and he couldn’t stop. As he got closer to the house I could see the fear in his face and then seconds later he hits the corner of a brick wall.

I shook my head and ran outside to see where Danny was. I spotted him coming around the curve. I started to yell at him to slow down, but he couldn’t hear me. As he got closer to where I saw him loose control of his pedals, I started yelling at him to keep going straight, not to come home, and to just keep going until he slows down and regain control. But he suddenly turns towards the house and he was coming so fast, and then bam, he hits the corner of the brick wall hard.

When I opened my eyes, Danny was sitting up legs stretched, and his whole body was bouncing off the ground at least a foot high. He was holding his head and bleeding badly. My mom heard the yelling and came running outside with my dad. It did not take long for my mom, Danny, and I to be on the way to the hospital. My dad stayed home to watch Lisa, and to wait for Danny’s mother to come home.

I think we were at the hospital about half an hour before Danny’s mom came in running. Danny had calm down, and was holding a bag of ice on his forehead. I told his mother what happened to him, and told her that he was going to need stitches.

My mom and I went back home after so I could babysit Lisa. They came home from the hospital a few hours later and Danny looked better, but tired. She told me that she had to wake him up every two hours because he had a concussion. I then went home, but I first took a look of his bike and the front wheel was badly bent.

He survived, but again I was not able to stop it, or prevent it from happening. If only I had more time.""

Thank you all for reading, remember, if you have any questions, feel free to ask. As for questions in the first post, I am hoping to answer them all sometime tomorrow.

Also, I just want to clarify that this was sometime in 1977-1978, so back then they didn't have helmets, and to stop your bike you had to pedal backwards. How this wasn't more serious, I have no idea.

Thank you all again for reading, I'm going to try and get one of her ghost experiences sometime this weekend.

EDIT: I want to add the answers to Starbrutal's questions. As for the first question, if I remember correctly, she has told me many times about this, her parents didn't believe her for the longest time, I'm not too sure when exactly they did. I will ask my mom for a better answer sometime today, I just want to try to answer these for you now.

And for the second question, from what she's told me, she's also having visions of people she doesn't even know, so it's hard to tell if they all came true or not. As for visions involving friends and family members, I believe they have all came true, but again, I will ask her for a better answer.

I hope these answers will help you understand for now, I'm going off of memory of what she's told me, and she tells me a lot from when she was younger, so it's hard to keep track of it a bit. I'll do another edit later today, thanks for the great questions.

EDIT2: To further answer Starbrutal's questions, I have asked my mom about it. She told me that she did tell her mom about seeing both events, and maybe some others, but she didn't really believe her until sometime when she was in her 20's. She did say that her mom called her a ""witch"" jokingly in French, but she's not too sure if that's the proper translation.

And as for other visions, she told me that every vision that she could confirm did come true. But some of people she didn't know is kind of hard to confirm. She also told me she saw accidents, and murders, and would see them in the paper sometime later. Pretty scary stuff for a little girl if you ask me.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g6wgj/the_confessions_of_a_psychic_part_2_a_few_years/
16,More stories from my urban explorations in Atlanta that make the rural setting seem meek.,1300509479,"About four years ago, when I got out of military school is when I moved back to Midtown, Atlanta. I lived just on the edge of Bankhead, which is no longer the product of rap songs. Lately, it's been gentrifying at an incredible pace due to people buying up extremely affordable homes at extremely depressed prices.

During that time, the gentrification had just got into a nice steady pace and all my black friends began talking about how they were finally tearing it down.

I didn't know much about it though, so I decided that I needed to have a ""look-see."" I put a couple water bottles in my backpack, took a bit of money for food, ate a large breakfast, downed my coffee and went on my merry way to a train track that led straight into Bankhead.

As I walked down the train tracks, I felt overcome with a sense of nostalgia, not mine though, the people who'd walked these tracks before me. I was flanked by old iron foundries and empty warehouses, the windows mostly gone now and the insides gutted to make way for posh lofts in the coming years.

I must have walked some five miles when I finally found what I was looking for. On the edge of the tracks was a three story, steel building that had seen much wear and tear, yet it somehow hadn't lost much of its luster. The windows were tall, like eyes and the boarded up doors covered in graffiti told me that it was fair game.

I found where someone else had cracked one of the boards slightly opened prior to my arrival. I slipped through the narrow slit into a world of musk and mold. Now immersed in dark, I had to use my cell phone as a flashlight to find my way.

At first, I was totally clueless in figuring out what drew me to that place; it was fucking empty. Not just empty, but devoid of anything except dust and graffiti all the way from the first floor to the top.

Annoyed that such a gem wound up being such a waste. I decided to leave. It was on my way out that I stepped on a steel plate that resonated from beneath, it was a door of some kind.

I fished around the edges until I was able to lift it, revealing a stairway that led into the dark depths of the old buildings basement.

""Oh, snap."" I muttered to myself out of anxiety. Nervous or not, I went forth.

The stairs were short, and led to a landing that wrapped around to another set of stairs that I couldn't yet see as I walked down the first set.

I wrapped around the corner and there my light hit water. The entire basement had flooded, but it was silent, no sound of running water to be heard.

I scanned my light slowly across the unwaivering sea when something caught my eye. I tilted my head this way and that and tried to focus on what I was looking at standing in the middle of the pool... a human!

""Oh, Jesus-fucking-Christ!"" I shouted, dropping my phone.

I snatched it up, turned around for a moment and stopped, that's when I realized, they weren't alive. Their arms had been bound behind their back and a plastic bag taped over their head. This was little consolation for the living.

I booked it out of there so fast that I actually knocked the plywood off the door and sent it skittering all over a patch of gravel, climbed the nearest hill into the city of Bankhead and ran to the first sign of civilization I could find, a Figo nearby.

I swung the door open, huffing and puffing and explained to the poor cashier behind the counter what I'd seen. The young girl gasped and was almost unable to call the police.

As it turns out, it was just some local gang member who'd gone missing some months earlier. Someone had brought him down there, tied him up to a pole and tortured him to death. Sometime after is when the place flooded due to a busted water main.

Urban exploration has its ups and downs, but witnessing this hasn't made me stop.

19,Silence.,1300491126,"As I write this, my house is completely silent. One may think that with silence comes peace and serenity, for me this is not the case. For me silence brings only dread, for I know that soon it must be broken by the only noise that ever intrudes upon it.

Of course, my life was not always plagued by this fear. I used to enjoy my solitary existence. I had never relished the idea of being the head of a family, the level of responsibility involved did not same worth it. My daily routine was simple, never troubled by the needs of others. Every day when I returned from work I would eat my dinner and then spend my evening in a comfortable chair, with a good book. I required nothing of others, and they demanded nothing of me. This was how my life would still be, no doubt, had the fates not conspired against me.

A few months ago I decided to go on holiday, by myself naturally. This was upon the advice of my doctor, who suggested that a change of scene may help with a bad cold that I had recently developed. On the day of my departure, I was ready to leave and had all my bags packed and waiting in the hall. At the last minute my office called, an emergency they said. I rushed out of the house, forgetting to lock any of the doors in my hurry. 

After having sorted out what transpired to be a trivial issue, I returned home. I noticed that my front door was slightly ajar, which concerned me at first, before I decided that the wind was the likely cause. I picked up my bags and just as I was locking the door, I thought that I could hear a faint banging coming from somewhere within my house. I paused for a second, the key already in the lock, before scolding myself for being so nervous. I grabbed my bags, threw them in the boot of the car and sped towards the train station.

The vacation passed without much incidence. I bought a newspaper on one of the days, and noticed that a young girl had gone missing in my home town, but otherwise life appeared to be continuing as normal. I returned home, feeling completely cured of my illness, and eager to return to my normal routine. It quickly became clear this would not be the case.

Upon entering my home I was greeted with a strange smell. It was very faint, but at the same time overpowering. I did not have time to find the source of the stench anywhere, and was forced to sprayed air freshener everywhere until it could be eliminated.

I retired to be early, feeling suitably fatigued after my travels. My sleep that night was troubled. I woke in the small hours of the morning in a cold sweat, brought on by some half remembered nightmare. All was silence, until I heard a very faint noise from somewhere downstairs. It was a banging noise, the sound of a hand beating upon a door. I assumed it was some drunk hammering at my front door, as has happened in the past, and that they would soon move on. Sure enough the noise subsided.

The following day the smell had worsened considerably. No amount of deodorant could mask it. Fortunately I was out of the house for most of the day, and went to bed almost as soon as I returned. The banging came again that evening, except this time it was different. It was no longer faint, but a steady beat. It was interjected at points by scratching. I decided enough was enough, threw back the covers and walked slowly down the stairs. The stench downstairs nearly made me gag, as I descended the banging also became louder.

It was at this point that it became clear that it was not coming from outside, but indoors, from my cellar to be more specific. As I approached the door the smell became the worst it had ever been. When I reached the door the banging came to an abrupt halt, and the scratching began. I have no shame in saying that I was terrified. I decided to return to bed, and open the cellar the following morning to face whatever was there in the light of day.

Early the next day I found myself in the same exact spot as the evening before, hand poised over the cellar door handle. Slowly I turned it, and opened the door.

What I found there is engraved upon my mind.

At the top step was the tiny body of a little girl, already partially decomposed. It required superhuman effort to stop myself from vomiting at the smell and the sight. I looked at the door of the cellar and my heart sank further. The inside of the door was covered with scratch marks from where this poor child had tried in vain to escape. I understood now why my door had been left ajar, when I had returned to my house.

I panicked and buried the body in my garden, praying now that the infernal noise would end. It did not. It haunts me wherever I go. Sleep has now become a distant memory, she will not let me sleep. If I am not in my house, the noise will be in my head, interrupting my every thought.

Now, perhaps, you can understand why I despise silence. She wants me to think it has ended, disappearing for days at a time, only to return when I finally try and forget about the horrible incident. She will never forget, and nor shall I.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g6roh/silence/
20,the number 20,1300487777,"Ever since I was 18 yrs old, I have lived on my own. During this crazy party filled, no worries, period of my life, the number 20 would always find my gaze. If I decided to randomly gaze at the clock, be it a watch, wall clock or on the tv, in the car, the time would always end in 20. It got to the point that I could say it was on 20 before I even looked at it. When these instances happened, I always got the deja vu feeling. Soon enough I could think about a situation that could possibley happen and look at the clock for the 20. It would be there if true, if not there was no worry. As I got older, I began to add the numbers on the clock to 20. Again this process worked the same way. Eventually I dismissed this a rubbish, and stopped thinking too much in to it.

22,2:35 am,1300482938,"A month ago I went to bed at around 1:30 am. I was unusually tired that night so I fell asleep rather quick. At exactly 2:35 am, I am woken up by a call from a blocked number. Being half asleep, I decided to pick up anyway just in case it was an emergency. First, there was silence.. The only sound I heard coming from the other line was static. Then, I heard it. A man was whispering to me from the other line. I was confused because I couldn't understand what he was saying so I did my best to focus on his voice. He kept asking me things, telling me to do things to myself to ""help him out"". I was shocked. He continued to tell me what I needed to do for another minute, resulting in a two minute call of nothing but whispering. I hung up. 
I call my boyfriend immidiately telling him what just happened. He tells me to make sure my window is locked and that if he calls back, I should not answer my phone. But the man called back while I was still on the line with my boyfriend and as soon as he was transfered to the call and heard my boyfriend's voice, he hung up. I waited for another call while I was still talking to my bf, but he didn't call back. I thought I was safe. I lay back down not forgetting the voice on the other line and I tell myself that I can't go back to sleep. Suddenly, he calls back. I answer asking him what be wants but he ignores my question and goes on telling me things I need to do to myself. I tell him he's a sick mother fucker and if he dared called back I would call the cops. As soon as I hung up, I heard a car speed away right outside my window. 
Sometimes, I hear like someone is outside lurking around near the bushes. I even thought I heard my window trying to be opened once. ",nosleep,MelissaMacabre,/r/nosleep/comments/g6p7g/235_am/
23,Death from Above/Why you should never move to Arizona,1300481811,"One night I was woken by what I can only call a disturbance in the Force, ""Damnit!"" I yelled to no one in particular, then rolled over. Just as my eyes were about to close, a little brown movement at the juncture of the wall and the ceiling froze me.   

You see this eventually happens to every Phoenician, one just never assumes it is their time when it comes. Tonight was my night. I was working in an ER at the time, and I've seen the people come in with the stings. Some of them have nothing more than a numb appendage, some have violent seizures, the degree of severity is dependent upon the victim. What kind of victim would *I* be?   

There, beginning to march across my ceiling was a bark scorpion. Now you may not believe in God, but I certainly believe in the Devil, as he sat there staring at me from the ceiling. You see friends, the bark scorpion is the most venomous scorpion in North America, it is also one that prefers to hang upside down and has incredible crawling ability. Imagine that, a creature that not only has the power to maim you, but do it in the utmost terrifying manner that is known as death from above.   

It was slow going at first and I was paralyzed with fascination, *march. . . . . . march. . . . .march. . . march* it moved towards me. Then it picked up the pace *march . . . march . . .march. . .march* , closer still. Panic set in, and I began to flail hopelessly against the sheets that I had so cozily wrapped myself in moments ago (I will never burrito myself again). *March. . March..March* It was now almost sprinting towards my kicking legs and thrashing arms, as it reached dead center above my face it stopped. . . then I stopped . . . it was a moment frozen in time between predator and prey. He knew he had me and wanted to revel in my fear. In the millisecond that we made what I can only assume is eye contact, he let go and began to fall to earth.

I yanked the sheets up over my head as fast as I could, horribly twisting my knee in the process, and heard death land on the sheet with a delicate pfffffft. There I lay, a thin layer of 300 count thread walmart sheets, that stood between me and death (or a very painful owie). It was fight or flight time, and I decided to run like a little girl. I heaved the sheet with as much power as one can muster throwing a stretched out sheet, not very hard at all. My attacker must have sensed this maneuver coming (because let's face it he can fucking defy gravity, so why is mind reading such a stretch?), and just as my hands reached the apex of the push, I felt a bullet enter my hand BAM! right the middle of the meatiest part of the palm.  

I HAD BEEN SHOT! I stumbled out of the room banging into the door frame, slamming into a banister, before crumpling in a heap at the top of the stairs (just like that nightmare where you can never quite keep your balance). I looked at my hand, it looked no worse for wear, but was completely on fire. As I set to walk down the stairs in a mountain of fear and defeat, I pulled my foot back, planted on the ball of my foot and spun around. ""Fuck this guy,"" I whispered to no one in particular and whipped open the closet to find a weapon.
Badminton racket in [good]hand I ran into the bedroom and turned all the lights on ready to engage in mortal combat, only to find no enemy to fight.

25,The scariest thing that ever happened to me...,1300477271,"I get chills whenever I tell people this story, and I can still never eat maple syrup because of it. So, where to start?

I was grocery shopping at my local A&amp;P, some friends were coming over to spend the weekend at my place and I wanted some food for them. I got the usual stuff, meats, breads, snacks etc. I decided that it would be fun to make pancakes in the morning since we would probably be hung over and nothing makes people feel better than pancakes! I got the mix and headed over to the maple syrup aisle...

I decided to splurge on one of the more expensive maple syrups, the kind with 15% real maple syrup, but still comes in the regular plastic bottle, not one of those $15 glass ones. I figure it would be good enough. I grab it and throw it in the basket. I go to the checkout, pay for my items and go home. 

After I get back and put the groceries away I'm feeling kind of hungry so I decide to make some waffles. I toast them up, lather them in butter and then open the cupboard to get the maple syrup. I open the top of the maple syrup and notice that there's a glob of syrup next to the spout hole, out of reflex I lick the glob and then.....a feeling of dread washes over me...

The maple syrup wasn't opened yet, the seal was not even broken and.....

26,"The ""ghost"" really stepped it up in my apartment last night...",1300476806,"Ever since I moved in to our [two bedroom apartment](http://i.imgur.com/dPiyu.png) with my girlfriend, there have been ""events"" that make us question whether or not the place is haunted. [The building, an 8-plex,](http://imgur.com/0ZLym) is located in a ""newer"" part of town, and the building can't be much older than 20 years, if that.

Anyway, I like to poke fun at my girlfriend, Jennifer, and roommate, Adam, because the ghost, or ghosts, generally get more ""excited"" while I'm away. I'll come home from work, and either Jen, Adam, or both will tell me about the scary thing that happened that day. Pretty stereotypical ghost stuff: Breath on the back of your neck, a breeze on your arm like someone just walked by you, the passing touch of a hand on your back, foot steps in the bedroom hallway, etc. Little things that make you think either their is a ghost, or you're crazy.

Now, I've heard a few things, like walking in the hallway while I'm sitting on the couch, alone in the apartment, but I usually chalk that up to someone walking upstairs, and the sound just reverberating oddly in my apartment. Like I said, the ""scary"" stuff doesn't happen while I'm home, so I generally don't believe the other two. 

One thing I will say that happens a lot, which I *try* to tell myself is part of the building, is the doors moving while they're open. The master bedroom door, my roommate's bedroom door, and the bathroom door all like to move while they are open. For example, I get home from work, walk into the bedroom and leave the door wide open. I'll start to grab clothes to change into, and then the door will begin to slowly close, 10-20 seconds after opened it. Meaning it stands there for 10-20 seconds not moving, then slowly starts closing. They never ""click"" shut, but they will close to the point where the locking mech is touching the door frame. 

Another example: If I'm home alone, I like to do my bathroom business with the door open (a habit I developed from living alone, and never closing inner doors). I'll be on the toilet, doing my thing, and a minute later I notice the door start to close. Not every time it moves, but I'd say 50-75% of the time, if I sternly say ""Stop closing the door!"" it will stop before it reaches the locking mech, about half-way closed. 

Anyway, I digress, but here's the story I wanted to get to. Last night, Jen and I were in the ""dining"" area (we keep a computer desk and use our laptops there; any real dining happens on the couch) when the tv in the living room turned on. I'm not sure about your tv, but this one I've had for a year and a half, and it has literally never turned on without someone hitting the power button on the tv or remote before. Jen and I just looked at each other, then I slowly walked into the living room to turn it off. I said while I walked ""You know, the remote is probably just in the side of the couch, and the dog probably sat on it."" When I got to the living room, I saw the remote, peacefully sitting on the arm of the couch, face up, with nothing around it. Regardless, I shut the tv off, and we kind of laughed away any nervousness.

Later that night, Adam joined us while I was making my lunch for the next day and Jen was surfing youtube. He had been gone for two weeks to see his parents, so it was nice to hang out again. The two of them were sitting infront of her laptop watching some video, and I put my elbows up on the counter behind them to see what they were laughing at when I heard a ""click."" It was loud, distinct, and I recognized it immediately as the sound a door knob inside makes when it is turned-open, ""clicking"" as the latch comes out of the hole in the door frame. Neither of them notice, but my dog, who was laying under the computer desk slowly and deliberately stood, walked into the living room, around the fireplace, and met me in the beginning of the hallway (I cut through the kitchen). She and I both just stood there and stared down the hallway to the master bedroom. 

The doors to the laundry, bathroom, and Adam's room were all completely closed. My bedroom door was not.

Jen and I neither 100% of the time keep the door open, nor 100% of the time close it, so I couldn't remember whether I had closed it or not, but it stood defiantly open, as if to mock me. It didn't bother me, though. No, what bothered me was the towel closet. The towel closet door sits slightly lower than all the others, so when you open it, it drags on the carpet, making it slightly more difficult to open than any of the other doors. In addition to that, when I came home that day, before using the bathroom, I layed my jacket infront of the closet and forgot to pick it back up. 

As I looked now, down the hall, I saw the closet door was wide open, my jacket wrapped around the bottom, which would have forced someone to pull extra hard to drag it open. It was blocking the wide-open bedroom door that Jen would have come through, so I knew she didn't open it, and Adam had no reason to get anything out of there, so I just stood there, not knowing what to do. 

I don't mean to leave this story just hanging, but there was no ""screamer"" that jumped out, the lights didn't flash, and I didn't feel a cold gust of wind. But for whatever reason, for the first time in the year and a half I've lived there, a door opened itself from being completely closed, and dragged my jacket with it to the fully open position. 

I'll update again if/when something else happens, but this was just too peculiar not to post here. I know reading this was uneventful, but when it happens to you, it really is ""no sleep"" inducing.

I'm not sure what kind of signal I'll get, but hopefully I'll be able to get something written regularly so y'all will know I'm still alive. [You can find it here](http://raggedlake.blogspot.com/).

I asked a few different friends if they'd like to go with me, but I've unfortunately told my stories of the place enough that nobody seemed too keen on the notion. Looks like I'll be bravin' this all by my lonesome. On my agenda are to do lots of hiking, try to map out any strange places, talk to any people who happen to be up there, and maybe see what I can fish up in the lake (assuming my old man's fishing gear is still there and in working condition).

28,The Lantern,1300465147,"This is a story from my youth in Florida. In order to provide a bit of context, the neighborhood i lived in was a small rural community, with houses fairly far apart on dirt roads with no street lights and very little in terms of real entertainment outside the home. One of the spots my friends and I would frequent in our travels walking around on the endless warm nights was a smallish cemetery behind a local church that bridged two neighborhoods together. The only other way to the other neighborhood was to walk nearly half a mile out of the way around a creek that separated them using a small two lane road that could be seen from the higher points of the cemetery.

One night in late autumn though when the weather at night would sometimes dip a bit below 60 or as any person in Florida would term it, arctic winter my friends and I were heading back into my neighborhood through the cemetery after dark, but not too late, probably only around 8 PM or so. We were all discussing the peculiarity of different theologies and their beliefs regarding the treatment of the dead when one of the members of my small group points to a lantern hanging in front of a tombstone to our left, going on to describe the way some people placed lanterns over their graves to be lit by their survivors to show that they are remembered after passing. Not five minutes pass from this point we are further down the trail near the top of a hill when several feet in front of us, a small wood and glass lantern on the side of a standing mausoleum suddenly ignites itself out of nowhere. I consider myself a skeptic, so I went over to investigate but there was no means by which it could have ignited itself and no obvious source of fuel which could be sustaining it. It was about this time that i looked back at my friends to shrug and suggest we move on when i noticed that their faces had all turned pale white and they were staring off towards the crossover down the creek. Standing in the middle of the road and facing straight towards us at the precipice of the hill was an unnaturally tall man wearing black robes and a wide brimmed hat. He walked to the edge of the street nearest to the creek and we could all see as he reached his hand out and pointed at us and let out a screeching noise that we could hear, clear as though it came from right beside us. The light from the lantern grew much brighter as he did this, quickly igniting the wooden frame, which then crumbled and dropped the lantern to the ground where the flames were immediately and curiously extinguished. Needless to say we screamed, then ran as fast as we could back to our respective houses thinking that whatever we saw it couldn't possibly follow all of us. I don't know if I was just unlucky, but every night for weeks after that incident I woke up in a panic, cold sweat running down my face and i would sit up in my bed and see the same tall figure walk out of the woods at the end of the dead end on which i lived and start to walk down the street past my house, and every time as it walked past my driveway it would look up into my window, and into me.",nosleep,khelp,/r/nosleep/comments/g6ip3/the_lantern/

30,Revelations of a Spirit Questor. Case:001 [solved] Part 1,1300454612,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here in r/nosleep. I was referred here by a redditor friend, and the posts here inspired me to share my own experiences as a spirit questor here in our city, somewhere in the Philippines.

Issue: Haunting reports, people heard noises and saw something and vanished etc.

Case: 001 
My first time joining my paranormal group's monthly quests, It was Halloween last year, and our group was invited by a local TV station asked us to conduct a quest in a haunted house built during the second world war. The house is now used as a lodging house with 7 rooms with different occupants in each room, 2 rooms were empty during the time of our quest.

The crew arrived first at the venue and set-up everything like all lights out and only 2 candles were lit at the balcony of the house. It was 7PM when we arrived at the venue, and waited for the tv crew to finish setting up their equipment. At around 7PM our president called out everybody to start our ritual before proceeding with the quest. We gathered and formed a circle outside the old house and performed the ""Tower of Light"" to protect us and the crew from any entities inside and outside the house.

There were only 6 of us spirit questors who attended that night and the group was divided into two, with 1 camera man each and two observers. After the ritual, I was selected to be in the first group then we immediately proceeded to the first room, while the other group has gone to the second room.

As my group entered the first room, the lights were out and it was pitch black. We started scanning the area for entities, energy and memory imprints. The room was small and only had a bedroom and a small dining/living room. My co-psychic and one observer went to the bedroom while the camera man, other observer, me and another co-psychic was left in the small dining/living room. The cameraman asked us to have just a small light from a cellphone at the center of the room so that he can capture anything even if its low light. My co-psychic started to meditate and called out any entity that is currently occupying that room. Our protocol was to write anything down on our own paper whatever our 5 senses can perceive, to avoid bias and later own we share our reports to confirm. As my co-psychic was doing his thing, the mirror behind the door caught my attention. At first I saw only our reflection, mine, my co-psychic and the camera man. As I started to stare and use my empathic abilities on the mirror, another reflection appeared in the mirror, since the light was very low, As I tried to get closer to the mirror so verify what I saw, and there he was, a tall dark shadow mimicking my moves in the mirror like wanting to play or just messing with me. Before I took out my pen and started writing what I saw, I looked back to confirm if what I saw was not another person's reflection, and then I confirmed it, all of our reflections are right and the dark entity in the mirror is really there. So I jotted down what I saw and kept playing with the entity in the mirror by moving around and he would follow my every move then asked the observer silently to check out the mirror if she saw anything unusual and she was scared at first, then I told her that nothing's to be scared about and am here with you, So she stared at the mirror for a minute and then said there was nothing unusual in the mirror, she said she only saw our reflections and nobody else. After continuing to scan the area for imprints, I closed my eyes and felt an unexplainable feeling near the door, it was warm and cold at the same time. I opened my eyes and I saw the dark entity from the mirror standing in front of me, and I was just stunned for 5-10 seconds, I was afraid but I already got used to them, but instances like popping out in front of me rarely occurs and scares the hell out of me.

31,Percy's Palace: A Night Of Exploration And Terror.,1300449143,"Here in Saskatchewan, ghost stories and legends run wild due to it's history and settings. Terrain that changes from kilometres of flat prairies, to hills and valleys. Among these varying settings, one can easily discover abandoned towns that died with the folks who lived in them, empty houses from the turn of the century, farms that were forgotten after the drought of the 1930's - and particularly, hauntings.

Several books have been written detailing the history of the vast plains and empty communities, and the darkness that resides within. Everything from accidents to murder are the framework of each ghost story, and those who have lived here long enough not only here these tales, but regard them as absolute fact.

I had been staying at my girlfriend's house in a small mining community known as Esterhazy. Esterhazy itself rests only several hundred feet above a very prosperous potash mine - which in itself, has a dark history of accidents and death. On the surface, Esterhazy is a peaceful - yet gossipy - town whose residents are heavily involved in the many churches, as well as bars.

The town of Esterhazy is influenced by it's Ukrainian roots, and the many historical sites within the limits are a testament to it's rich, religious history.

The story I plan to tell, for the most part, disregards Esterhazy, although one must wonder if the several haunts and legends that leave a heavy atmosphere on the town makes this story more fact then fiction.

My girlfriend and I were staying together for a week in Esterhazy, and being the adventurous character I am I had pestered her for days on any good locations for urban exploring. She had shown me all the historic sites, and even took me out to The Maze - a patch of forest 10 minutes outside of town, off a gravel road, that seems to have an old dirt path carved through it which - from a curious wanderer's point of view - seems to split off into other sections of the forest, and almost always ending with a dead end. Stories from the locals range from a playful farmer, to a gateway to hell being at the very end of The Maze.

In the end, she reluctantly told me of a place - not far from The Maze - that is abandoned. A tall, turn of the century home that many of the young-ins call Percy's Palace.

The story of Percy's Palace varies. Some say that it was a home in which it's occupants got up and left unexpectantly - leaving their things behind. A much more sinister story is of Percy; a benevolent man who was known by locals to be an alcoholic, and possibly insane. In the period of time that Percy had supposedly lived, he was outcast by locals due to rumours of being a pedophile - and when a time came where children had seemed to go missing, Percy was blamed by all of the town folk for being the one who taken them. In other words, Percy was a 1960's Freddy Krueger.

Whether or not Percy had ever been involved in the kidnappings is entirely up to one's mind. No evidence had ever been linked to Percy, and the bodies of the children were never found.

As the story goes, Percy ended up taking his own life inside of his basement. Locals claim that Percy still wanders the giant house, and those who go there to party end up being shooed out by shrieks and slamming doors.

Another odd curiosity with Percy's Palace, is that those who attend his home in their vehicles - will more often than come back to their vehicles to find it ransacked. People claim that this could be due to a farmer nearby, however, there are no farms in the area for another 4km.

The night was bitterly cold, in the dead of January. It was snowing heavily, and a wind came through that chilled you to the bone. My girlfriend, her friend and I let Esterhazy for the Palace around 11:30PM. It was a short drive, as a large part of the traveling was on foot through very deep snow. We had made sure to bundle up efficiently, and had only our phones and my camera to give us light (the flashlight we had brought with us mysteriously died as we left the car).

Along with this story, I shall post pictures of the adventure at the end.

We trudged through the snow and darkness for several minutes, until we reached a clearing through the brush that revealed a large wooden barn nearly torn to pieces on the ground, and a large, faded wooden house. The palace was approximately three stories tall, counting the rather spacey attic. The area itself produced an eerie silence, and as soon as the house had come into view, I snapped photos fervently.

The front of the Palace was completely overgrown by trees and brush that one had to suffer scrapes from twigs and branches just to get onto the porch.

Getting onto the porch was a different matter; approximately three - four feet off the ground, the only boost one could get was an old, snow covered brick.

After testing the deck to make sure we weren't going to fall through, we made our way through the open doorway - the door literally hanging off it's hinges. Instantly the smell of must and mold mixed in with the smell of cold we were so accustomed to. It was oddly dark inside. Of course, it was dark outside as well, but for some reason - the dark seemed almost... Thick inside of the house. There was a heavy atmosphere that seemed to cry. It was and still is very difficult to explain the emotion of the old house. It was as though there was a different cold there. A cold that didn't just chill your bone, but froze your soul.

We toured through the main floor, seeing couches and chairs, an old bed - even an old stove. By the looks of it, it was though someone was living there, but up and left - and over time dust and mold began to take hold of it. The most of obvious signs of human contamination was several empty bottles of alcohol were strewn about, as well as minor graffiti. Chairs and tables were thrown about, and garbage had been piled by the front door. If I was a ghost here, I would be pretty pissed if some teenagers came into my home and messed it up, too.

The one thing on the main floor I took notice of was the door to the basement. It was sealed shut. All doors in the house were either open or not attached to the frame. After some time, we were able to push open the basement door only to discover that the stairs to the basement didn't exist. All that was there was darkness; even our lights could penetrate it.

We went upstairs to the second floor up a small staircase, which I was certain would collapse - but we made it up none-the-less. The second floor was almost a maze. It was hard to make out the floor plan because it seemed that each room led to other rooms which led to other hallways which led to closets and smaller rooms. It seemed unnatural and almost impossibly large. Perhaps it was the darkness and the feeling of being in a foreign place, but it didn't feel right. Each of the rooms we came across were either empty, or torn apart. One room in particular (5th and 6th from the bottom in the link) had a door that led outside. Of course, as soon as I opened the door I found that there wasn't any stairs. It was a straight drop down with nothing but snow at the bottom. Another weird feature of the room were these dark stains all over the walls. To my mind, it looked like blood, but looking back I realize it was probably mold.

We thought that our little adventure was over, but then I discovered in one of the closets, a tiny staircase leading to the attic. The stairs winded upwards and were wide enough just to fit you. My girlfriend and my friend didn't want to go up, but being the curious person I am I led the way.

The attic was large. It had rafters that reminded me of a church ceiling, and a large brick chute going through the centre. The place was completely trashed. It seemed that this was the place where most people hung out. All sorts of junk hung about. Although the weirdest thing we found was an old yellow dress that could have fit my girlfriend.

At this point I started to joke around and start calling out Percy. I joked that he needed a maid, and maybe somebody from Trading Spaces to come and fix it up. My girlfriend was getting freaked out and decided to leave, followed by her friend. I decided to try and provoke Percy. I called him names, I swore, I called him a pedophile.

Several seconds later, I heard a loud crash below me and my girlfriend and her friend scream.

I jumped down the stairs to find them bolting down the second set of stairs. When I caught up with them, They said that they heard someone running towards them followed by the door behind them slamming shut. I tried to tell them that it was probably the wind that did it until her friend pointed out the basement door. It was shut.

We approached it and tried to open it but it was sealed once again. Her friend and I tried kicking it open but it wouldn't budge. As soon as we had given up we heard a loud BANG! against the other side of the door. By this point I am scared as well, and we decide to leave. Before we leave however, we heard yelling. Faint, but audible yellowing coming from above. Followed by footsteps and a door closing. The hairs are standing up on my neck and I tell them to run.

We ran like Kenyans back to the car, but as I ran I turned around a few times to snap one more picture of the house (the final picture in the link).

My girlfriend seemed distant for the rest of the night, and when I asked what was wrong later on, she said that when she was in the attic she felt someone rubbing their hands up and down her legs slowly. When she tried to leave the attic she swears she felt something touch her face gently and whisper her name.

We plan to never go back.

32,My Childhood Home,1300435045,"Okay, so I apologize if this turns out poorly written but its been a long day and my mind is racing to some weird places right now.  I figured this would be the best place to write about my early years, and what made me believe in all this terrifying shit, but I digress.

So when I was a kid, very young, around '95 or so I lived in a very small house that was built in the '30s.  I remember being absolutely terrified of sleeping by myself as a kid, which led to me sleeping in my parent's bed.  I think it might have been due to all of the banging around in the house.  One of my earliest memories is the vivid sound and image of me cowering underneath my Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles blanket as I heard something banging around in the laundry chute, which was right next to my bedroom.  

I was so terrified of this sound that I couldn't even get up to run to my parents bed.  I tucked myself deep under the protective covers and gripped on tight to the mattress.  I had no idea what the noise was, but I figured me and my race car bed could take whatever it was.  After awhile the banging stopped and I began to calm down.  I heard my doorknob turn and the door open.  I don't think I had ever gotten as flat as I had that night.  I felt like a sheet of paper on that mattress.

I heard someone shuffle around my room as I held back tears hoping that whatever was in my room would leave.  I never heard that door close that night and I never fell asleep.  In the morning I saw that the sun was up through my blanket and figured it would be safe to come out, and luckily I was right.  My door was shut, but my toys were out of place.  I had set up my army men up, but they were knocked over like someone had stepped on them.  Also, if anyone remembers those plastic tents, my Power Ranger tent was completely disassembled and folded up neatly.

For the next few months I refused to sleep anywhere but in my parent's room, except for naps.  Eventually I assumed I was safe and began to calm down.  A few days later my mom told me she was pregnant.  It was at that moment I knew I needed to start sleeping in my room again.  For awhile it was fine, it was the summer of '96, my sister was born, and I was a year away from kindergarten.  I had grown up, in my opinion at least, into a man.

I was up late watching the Flintstones one night when I heard a bang on the side door of my house, I was startled to say the least.  I knew it was late and there was no way I was going to answer it.  Seconds later there was a banging on the front door, about ten feet away from where I was.  At this point I was frozen in shock.  Luckily my dad woke up, as my sister was crying and asked why I was still up.  I told him I was just watching tv and that I heard someone banging on the doors.

He opened them both up and saw nothing.  He stayed up for a bit, getting my sister back to sleep, and we watched some tv.  I wanted to tell him about that night that was so many months ago but I didn't think he'd believe me.  After a bit I fell asleep and he must've put me in my bed.

A week or two later I was at home with my dad and sister in the middle of the day.  For some reason I wanted to watch some animated movie about Santa.  My dad and sister were laying down for a nap when I decided to do so.  I opened up the cabinet that was under the tv, which was where we kept our VHS tapes.  All of a sudden the cabinet topples over and this big, heavy, 36"" box-tv comes crashing down on me.  I screamed bloody murder and my dad came running.  

To this day, I am convinced that all of these events are related, and that the thing that came in my room that night was also the thing that was banging on the doors and pushed my family's tv onto me.

I've got a midterm tomorrow so I'm going to call it a night.  If there's enough interest I'll share more of my experiences in my old house later.  May peace be with you all.",nosleep,kneedeepatatp,/r/nosleep/comments/g6azv/my_childhood_home/
33,Really weird sleepover.,1300427800,"   So I was set to sleep over at my friend's house for five days during spring break while his parents and sister (his sister is also my girlfriend) goes out of town. I was mad to find out that my friend invited his girlfriend over for the WHOLE time. I decided to rough it out. 
   
Now, my friend's girlfriend, (even though they TECHNICALLY aren't going out) is gothic/emo/whatever. I think she does it for attention, but thats besides the point. She claims to have ghosts follow her and whatnot, which I believe is just bullshit.
  
Now, on the last day of the sleep over, my friend's girlfriend leaves. So me and him are just chilling out, playing PS3 and Xbox 360, like normal teenagers. And for whatever reason, I start to talk about how ever since my Grandma died, there has been some weird occurences at my house. People claim to smell her and feel her in the room. Also my mom had cleaned her room out, but could not find my Grandmas wedding ring. Then the next day my mom's ring suddenly went missing and in its place (in my mom's jewelry box) there was my grandma's missing ring. It appeared out of nowhere. Then my friend also told me that weird things has happened since his Grandma died too. Oddly enough, he said that weird things ONLY happen when he's alone in the house. We change the subject and carry on our game playing for hours.
   
At about 11PM, we are playing Xbox 360, then suddenly out of the corner of my eye I see a giant black human shadow pass behind me. I freak out and whip my head around, only to see an empty room. I stare back at my friend and ask if he saw it too. He says no, but he says he felt something tap his shoulder and he thought it was me. At this point, my stomach dropped. We figure it was out imaginations so we go back to playing videogames. We also played happy music with my laptop, as if to lighten the mood. 
   
Over the next five hours, we hear what seems to be knocking and his cat door opening and closing. We just assume it was the wind blowing against the windows and doors. But at one time we hear drums pounding. My friend does own drums in his downstairs patio room, but they are electric and need to be switched on to be played. We thought this was really weird, but we try to act cool and ignore it.
  
At about 5AM, we decide we should go to sleep. My bed that i sleep in is in the downstairs patio, where the drums are. Right when we step outside we see the door to the downstairs is wide open. The door to the downstairs has a lock on it, so theres no chance the wind blew it open. We look at eachother, puzzled. We think someone might be down there. So we slowly enter the room and peek around each corner. I got scared when we saw his cat in the corner of the room, crying. Not even meowing, just simply crying. As we get closer, the cat lowers itself and looks around wildly, while still crying. The cat runs out very quickly, as if something scared it. I decide I do not want to sleep down there that night.
   
As me and my friend go back to his main house, I reach for the knob, just to find that it is locked. I ask my friend why he locked the door, only for him to answer, I didn't. He then tells me that the only way to lock the door is to lock it from, the inside. Me and my friend freak out. At this point we are convinced there is someone messing with us. 
  
We get a spare key and open the door. Suddenly, every door in the house is only open by a sliver. We slowly open each door and look under every bed expecting to see someone. We find nothing. We still do not know what locked the door. We choose to sleep it off. I set up in my friend's sister's room (aka my girlfriend). We say goodnight to eachother, and I witness my friend closing his door.
   
At this time, I am locked in a room with only the lamp light on. I clutch my phone as I go under the covers. I reach for the lamp and switch it off. Once I close my eyes, I hear slow walking, which at the time I thought was his cats walking. But I hear the footsteps go to the bedroom door, and I hear, ""Sleep tight,"" in a low shakey voice, as if someone spoke right against the door. My eyes shot right open and my heart sunk. I yell, ""What?! Hello?!,"" hoping it was my friend. I text my friend in the other room, asking if he said something. He said ""yeah, I heard you just say 'sleep tight'"" I tell him I heard the same thing and thought it was him. We both are extremely freaked out. I end up falling asleep with the light on. 
   
When me and him wake up, we go outside to the downstairs room. In the downstairs room there is also a big freezer and a refridgerator. On top of the refridgerator there is a coffee maker. Well when we go outside to see, that coffee maker is fallen on the floor. There was no scratch marks or broken glass. The pot itself would have definitely shattered from the fall. But no, there was no damage. Also there is a strainer contraption in the coffee maker, and to take it out you need to unscrew a part. But there it was, all disassembled and perfectly intact on the floor, as if someone or something did it. 
   
We do not know what we were seeing or sensing or messing with us. And the weird part is that nothing scary happened when his Ghost Believer girlfriend was there. Before, I always wanted to see a ghost or go to a real haunted house. I would watch scary movies and mock them. For now, I've had enough ghost-time for now. It only happened a few days ago, and my mom told me to write about it while it was still fresh in my mind. I don't think I will forget about it for some time.",nosleep,CAPTAINLOCK,/r/nosleep/comments/g69fh/really_weird_sleepover/
34,"My iphone just did something really weird, and I'm kind of freaking out",1300425124,"I've tried googling this a little bit, but I don't really know what terms to use. Here's what happened: I started up a facetime session, but instead of the live video stream of myself, there was a static picture of me. A picture from earlier in the day when I was using my phone (recognized the background and a different shirt I had on). So... while I was just screwing around on my phone a few hours ago, it fucking took a picture of me without me telling it to.

Here's what's perhaps even weirder. I closed the facetime session and opened up my photos. Completely empty. (This isn't out of the ordinary, because I dumped my photos to the computer yesterday.) But where the fuck is my phone storing this photo of me that it took without me telling it to take a picture? And how long has it been silently taking pictures of me? Has anyone ever heard of this before?

35,"""He knows...""",1300419470,"It was the beginning of December, this past year. It was in the low forties that night, uncommonly cold for central Florida. I normally work evening shifts, so I had come home to my boyfriend and two little girls asleep. I did my normal routine:take the leftovers from the nights dinner and nuke it in the microwave, go abouts putting left out toys and stuff away, settle in front of the TV with my dinner, drink and remote. A couple hours pass and I am enjoying the newest episodes of ""American Dad"". At 2:32am I heard movement outside. It sounded like someone struggling. Suddenly I hear 3 heavy loud bangs come from the wall, in between the 2 bedrooms. I was confused at first, we live on the third floor at the end of the apartment building. I remembered then that in that direction was the staircase, so I assumed it was a late worker like me. I kept hearing more scuffles in the general direction, plus more loud bangs. I ignored them for the most part. Just as the noises stop, the doorknob to my apartment began to rattle loudly. I jumped as I heard a key slide in, and the door shake fiercely as someone tries to get in. I mute the TV, terrified as they continue to struggle to get in. Thoughts pass through my head, should I run across the hall to my bedroom and wake my boyfriend? Should I run to my toddlers and check on them? Both would mean having to cross the kitchen and front door. It then made me realize something that drained the blood from my face. When my boyfriend cooks the evening meal, he does so with the kitchen window open, leaving it open all night to clear out the gas smelling air. the window was right next to the front door, wide open, with a flimsy see through curtain keeping whatever is out there out. Whatever it was, it had a male voice. I could not see him, nor could he see me, since I was on the other side of the kitchen wall. But I could hear, as he stopped rattling the door knob, his heavy, gasping breathing as his hands ran across the outside wall. He stood there for quite a while, paralyzing me from moving in case I saw him. I only pleaded with fate he wouldn't try crawling in. Soon the breathing faded. I shakily unmuted the show and continued to watch more of the series till I could calm down. I did not get up from my spot until sunrise.

When my boyfriend woke for work he felt me shivering next to him. After I explained the situation he nodded and told me it must of been a drunk. I asked how could a drunk make it up 3 flights of stairs, but he said it happened before and was surprised I didnt hear anything he said. Calming down I settle for a days sleep and prepare for work. I soon forget the night and continue with my usual routine. A week passes and 2 am found me in the same spot, watching ""Mythbusters"". Suddenly I heard 3 loud bangs, and something dragging atop the stairway. Again the night is filled with rattling doorknobs and heavy breathing. I remained paralyzed on the couch, barely breathing in fear of provoking more. I tried convincing myself it was some poor drunk, but something felt way off about this. As time goes on life ran smoothly. We were about to move to a new apartment complex across town, the girls were as naughty as ever, and I was to start a new job, with better time for me to spend with my family. But still, every week, between 2 and 3 am, the loud bangs come, and the man returns to try and enter. Not once have I faced him, not once have I tried to get help, it always happened after boyfriend was asleep. I tried complaining to the owners, requesting more security. But so far they never found the drunk man. It came at great relief when we moved.

We got lucky, we got the new apartment in perfect time, all fixed up nice. We had a month to move in and we got all our stuff in a week. My boyfriend and I both worked, but it was mainly our laziness that we waited till the last week to come in and clean up the old apartment. Around 2 and a half weeks passed since we left the old apartment. But we still remember locking it last we left. As soon as we both walked up the staircase did I feel something off. It was colder up here then on the ground. So when we turned the corner to our apartment door, we both stopped in our tracks. The kitchen window was open. As we walked slowly to the front door, boyfriend reached for the knob, and realized it was unlocked. I was terrified and so was my boyfriend, but wanting to be strong he pushed the door open and walked in, hands raised in case he needed them. It soon came apparent we were alone. Sighing in relief we went about cleaning. As we did though, we began calling out to each other questions on unusual things. Like, why is the all the paper from the torn up coloring book piled in the corner? Did you use the bathroom recently, I could of sworn there was a toilet roll here? Excetera. It wasnt until we reached the living room where the TV and couch use to be. Right where I use to sit, except on the floor, was what looked like someone sat on the flor, in front was an empty, dirty plate, dirty glass, and newspaper. We both knew we didnt eat here last, saw we approached it slowly. As boyfriend checked the room closet, i lifted the stuff off the floor, in the newspaper fell out other papers, including envelops. Hoping to get some info to report to police, I looked at the envelops, and found out it was my own mail. Letters addressed to me/with their addresses ripped out. Once again the dreaded feeling overtook me and I was paralized, wide eyed with fear. My boyfriend approached me and shook me. Finally I slowly looked up at him, terrified. He looked worried and confused. He then looked at what I was holding up. The newest envelop I had that was torn open, was a letter referring to our recent move to the new apartment. Our new address was torn away. He looked at my eyes as I began to shake.

36,Just wanted to say thank you (sort of).,1300418053,"I am off-topic and I ask the mods to forgive me.  But these are some of the scariest stories I've ever read and I wanted to thank everyone for posting them.  I mean, they're so bad I almost can't bring myself to read them.  They end with so little explanation.  Really they remind me of a couple of short story collections I read over the past several years--which were so disturbing I almost wish I hadn't read *them* either.

I didn't mean for this to become a commercial--again, mods, please forgive me.  But for what it's worth, as I think everyone who loves /r/nosleep would love these, here you go: [Inferno](http://www.amazon.com/Inferno-Ellen-Datlow/dp/0765315599/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1300417882&amp;sr=8-1) and [The Dark](http://www.amazon.com/Dark-New-Ghost-Stories/dp/0765304457/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300417970&amp;sr=1-1).  I'd never heard of their editor when I read them, but now, any new collections she puts out I'm going to hunt for.

Warning: these do not particularly have happy endings.  Just like the stories here.

And the writers!  If you read any of their other stuff...oh boy.  In particular Laird Barron is one to watch out for.  He is NOT CHEERY.

Anyhow I hope I don't get banned for this....Don't really see any place to chat about stuff like this, and I didn't want to hijack a thread on any of the incredibly disturbing things you guys talk about.

Just amazing the work that's done here.  Whether the stories are supposed to be true or not I have no idea.  I don't want to ask.  Sort of afraid to have anything *notice* me.",nosleep,mushpuppy,/r/nosleep/comments/g66n7/just_wanted_to_say_thank_you_sort_of/

38,I think *I* am haunted.,1300408399,"I am no writer, and these aren't really good stories, I just need some other people to tell me I am not crazy.  I don't want to tell my friends and family because I don't know if they will think I have lost it or not.  But I think I have a ghost that follows me.

When I went home for the winter break the past December, there was a week that I was at my house and my mom and sister were gone.  So I was home alone.  The first weird thing that happened was a door slamming open.  The door that slammed open is on a crooked part of the house, so no matter where you leave it it likes to close itself.  So the fact that it slammed open scared me.  And it stuck against the wall for a few seconds, then let go.  My cat was sitting on my lap and when that happened she stood up and arched her back.

The next day I am just sitting at my computer, and I hear a sink turn on in my mom's bathroom...but everybody is out of town.  I know how cliche that is but it made me VERY uncomfortable and I went over to a friends house for the rest of the day, and I stayed the night there.

A few nights later I was doing my laundry, and I look over into my mom's bedroom and I see a human shaped shadow walk half way across the room, stop, and turn around.  I dismissed this for a few seconds as my mind playing tricks on me, but then I looked down at my feet.  Both of the cats were standing at the entrance to the door, looking in, completely fluffed up, back arched, and they started hissing.  I left to my friends house again, even though it was hard to leave the cats.

After that my mom got back and I didn't really have any more experiences.  A few weeks ago I bought a kitten because I was getting lonely in my apartment, and kittens are awesome.  Now, in my apartment I get this feeling a lot like there is something else in the room, behind me.  It is a very ominous presence.  I never turn around because I just can't.  I ignore it long enough and it goes away.

Two nights ago I am laying in my bed watching tv, my kitten on my chest sound asleep.  All of the sudden that feeling comes back.  Skadi (the kitten) sits straight up and stares at the ceiling, and starts yelling.  I had never heard her meow that loud.  She started running up and down the bed, just yelling at the ceiling.  I have a clapper so I turned on my light, and there was NOTHING on the ceiling, or any of the walls.  So I don't think she was chasing a bug.

Then last night as I am trying to get to sleep again, that feeling comes back stronger than ever.  I get so scared I start crying, and I am just too afraid to move.  I SWEAR something is right behind me, in the closet.  I am getting freaked out just typing about it.  Skadi is sitting next to me, eyes as wide as they can be, and I feel coldness start at my head and run all the way down to my feet, slowly.  Like something is dragging its finger along my body.  Once it gets past my feet, the cat jumps off the bed and just starts hissing and attacking the wall.  I didn't sleep last night.

Sorry this isn't very well written, I just need some peace of mind from some other people.  I wouldn't call myself a skeptic, but I have always been on the fence when it comes to ghosts.  I would probably dismiss everything that has happened if it wasn't for the cats freaking out.  It has never been violent, but it doesn't FEEL friendly...

That feeling just came back, but it is probably just because I am talking about it.  I hope.",nosleep,doctuhjason,/r/nosleep/comments/g63do/i_think_i_am_haunted/
39,Update to Nearsighted Story:  convo with my sister,1300407648,"Read the [original](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g4s34/nearsighted/) first for this to make better sense.  I talked to my sister, here's the conversation: 

Me:  Hey

Sent at 2:09 PM on Wednesday

Sis:  Hey

Lauras still such a fucking bitch

Omg now she is taking my laundry detergent and not asking

Me:  Just move, you can switch dorm rooms in less than a day

Seriously 

Sis:  uggghhhh no

 only a few more months to go

Me:  Okay, so I need to ask you if you remember something from right after we moved into the new house

You were only 7, so maybe you don’t remember

Sis:  uh, ok go ahead

Me:  Remember when Grandma G. sent us the Easter basket and all the Barbies?

Sis:  YES!!!! the night we saw the scary old man!!!!!

Me:  So you remember?

You were really scared, you wouldn’t even talk about it later

Sis:   um, no

I told mom and dad an old guy with gray and white hair and white eyes was in our hall last night but they didn’t believe us

I mean yeah I was scared of him but not scared to tell them

Me:  he had white eyes?

Sis:  well no not all white…..you saw him too!

whats it called, hang on let me google it

cataracts I think

Me:  I saw a man there, I thought it was dad because I didn’t have those ugly-ass glasses yet

Sis:  yeah i remember thinking how the hell did she confuse that scary guy for dad

Me:  So you never saw him after that?

Sis:  you don’t remember?

Me:  You never told me if you did

Sis:  Dad started working the night shift at the plant for awhile

Me:  Yeah

Sis:  So he never played with us anymore 

Me:  Yeah we barely ever saw him for a few months there

Sis:  anyway so I was in the family room one evening watching bambi and I saw dad in his downstairs study room and jumped off the couch to ask him if I could have some oreos

Me:  Yeah?

Sis:  I got about two steps and see that it’s the old guy

Me:  Ahhhhh what??? 

I just shit myself

Sis:  I’m not lying, just for a split second then he was gone

AND dad had already left for work the night anyways

why?  did you see him after that?

Me:  I don’t know for sure

I’m really freaking out right now though

Sis:  well then I got in trouble in school after that

Me:  Go on, by the way can I post this online?

Sis:   to facebook?

Me:  No, an anonymous place

Sis:  I guess if you want to

Me:  thanks

Sis:  I didn’t really get in trouble in school
but mom got mad at me b/c I kept talking about the man who came to our room at night in class whenever we had to write or tell a story
so Ms. Blane was concerned I guess and thought it was my own way of telling her that I was being abused by some man who was living with us

Me:  WHAT????  When was this?

Sis:  dunno, not long we saw him though

Me:  Okay

Sis:  Remember they showed us those videos in class to make us hyper aware of molesters and such?

Me:  Oh yeah

Sis:  You don’t remember me getting in trouble with mom?  Someone actually went to your class and asked your teacher if anything seemed wrong with you and your teacher said you weren’t paying attention in class and the school counselor was going to talk to us together but mom came in to school and told them everything was fine?

But they realized later that your problem was that you just couldn’t read the board

Ahahaha they thought you were a damaged child for awhile

Me:  I don’t remember that clearly but I’m sure mom was really embarrassed since that was our first year at the new school

Sis:  Oh god they were probably like what kind of family is this???

Me:  For what it’s worth, I do think I might have seen the man too

All I can remember is that sometimes I thought I saw dad and smiled or waved but he didn’t wave back and was really thin

Sis:  yeah, he was old and frail from what I saw

ok, so I really did see something then?  because I’m getting a little freaked out tbh

Me:  Bet you’re glad Laura is there now

Sis:  No! 

fuck that bitch

I’d rather have old man

Me:  You probably shouldn’t say that

Do you think he was a ghost or something?

Sis:  I dunno

lets call Scooby and the gang!!!

Me:  Who were the previous owners?

Sis:  no idea, maybe he died in the house?

Me:  Creepy!!!! No!!!

Sis:  IN OUR ROOM

Me:  Or the office…

Sis:  maybe you should ask mom, I don’t want to bring it up because I got in trouble talking about the fucking old man, you ask her

Me:  Okay

Did I mention I’m shitting myself?

Sis:  sorry can’t help

Laura took all my detergent

Me:  lol

Just a quick note, my moms first language is French, and even though she speaks just about perfect English, her grammar and spelling in English isn't perfect, so please excuse any mistakes. I tried my best to clean it up, while not changing her words too much.

This is her story.

July 1975

""At the age of thirteen I had my first “vision”. I was sitting on my bed, reading a book for a school project. All of a sudden I started to see my neighbor’s kids, and their friend climbing the train behind our house. There were three boys on top of the train car, and the smallest one was trying to climb the train while his brothers and the one friend were laughing at him.

I remember him getting angry and he managed to climb a few feet. Then I saw the train start to move and Dédé’s (smallest boy) foot slipped and the train wheel cut all his toes off.

As I saw this, I started to feel nauseous, I shook my head a bit, and for a few minutes I was wondering, what just happened? To me, it was just my imagination, so I kind of shook it off for the moment, and went back to reading my book.

About five minutes later I could hear kids out back playing, so I thought. Then I remembered what I had just seen in my head. With this in mind, I quickly got off my bed and went to the window and saw the boys trying to climb the train. I opened my window and started to yell at them, telling them to get away from the train. 

They were all laughing, and yelled back. “The train is stopped, it’s not moving.”

I yelled back at them again, and begged them to please get off the train.

“Dédé, you’re going to get hurt, please come down.”

Again, they laughed, but not for long, the train suddenly jerked, and the boys started to panic. As the train started moving very slowly, Dédé lost his grip and his foot slipped onto the tracks. Within seconds Dédé was yelling from the pain and crying so loud. The other boys managed to get off the train safely luckily.

I ran down the stairs, and my neighbor next door was sitting outside on the front stairs, and I kind of yelled at her that Dédé was hurt behind the house. I told her that the train cut off his toes, I then remember her saying “Oh no, oh no!” and then yelled “Show me!”

We ran by the fence, up a hill, and there were all the kids and Dédé sitting there crying, yelling, and then his mom joined in on the yelling and crying. She happened to have a tea towel on her shoulder, and wrapped it around his foot.

I don’t really remember who took them to the hospital, but I ended up staying behind and babysitting the other kids and waited for hours for any news.

I think it was about 3:00am when she finally came home. She told me that Dédé lost all his toes except for a bit of his big toe, but he lost it. He was transferred to Ottawa Kids Hospital, where he stayed for almost four months.

This was my first vision, and I could not help him.""

If anyone has any questions or anything, please ask, and I'll try to answer them as best as I can. Also, if anyone wants to read more about her experiences, rather it be more visions, ghost sightings, or maybe even readings she has done, please let me know and I will see what she can tell me to share.

Thank you all for reading.

EDIT: Added date. Also note, this took place not long after her thirteenth birthday, which was on July 2nd.

EDIT2: Just want to let everyone know that I gave her everyone's questions so she can answer them. I should have answers for everyone hopefully by tonight if not tomorrow afternoon.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g5q1m/the_confessions_of_a_psychic_part_1_first_vision/
44,Found a missing muscle today and I feel wonderful.,1300343097,"So this morning I was working on a screenplay that will hopefully be made into a 30 minute movie in a Tuberculosis-Awareness project that is a collaboration between a Foundation and a Hospital here in Thailand, and in one moment it was decided that I would do a little meditation. I had previously watched a [lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCWP4pODbs) in which a man explained meditation in a way my scientific-oriented mind was able to comprehend, but knowing hadn't done me very much until I actually get to practice it. And I gotta say, within five minutes of meditating, constantly monitoring my distractedness and bringing back focus, I understood what awareness is. I have it. 

It's a whole new world of perception. You simply just perceive more of everything. I don't think I ever have to be bored again. Like now, I live in such an absurd world where I can make a post with this kind of introduction and suddenly slide off into the unexpected territory for a while by making this awkward sentence and then spin in right back on topic and still be aware of itself being aware of itself.  

The only way to be aware of something is to be aware of it. There is no seeing but seeing, and no other mockery of secondhand interpretations can ever do it justice. 

Have you ever felt so numb in your arm or leg that you feel like you don't feel them? Of course you have. Did you remember how it felt afterwards when the numbness are fading away and you start to have regain a more complete perception of your limbs? Think of awareness like it is a secret muscle that we human naturally have, only we have become so distracted that we've forgotten how to use it. By meditating, you relearn how to be aware of this muscle in your mind. It was a wonder realizing how distracted I was that I didn't know how distracted I was. 

Anyway I have to get back to work now, so I'll ask you to trust me when I say that this is by far the second best thing that I've ever done for my life. The first was abandoning my belief in god. 

You don't have to watch the video now, but remember this message for those times that you get a tinging sense that you have become too distracted, or just curious to try something new, whatever works.",nosleep,animistern,/r/nosleep/comments/g5pgi/found_a_missing_muscle_today_and_i_feel_wonderful/
45,"Lucky, Lucky.",1300340464,"A strange feeling overcomes me as I lay back in bed. It's a strange feeling, sort of like deja-vu. I spread my arms out and feel my right hand land gently on a pile of soft and familiar fur. I smile, recognizing this furball as my cat, Lucky. I named her Lucky when I was 10 years old because she was lucky my mother saved her. She was run over on the highway in front of the gas station my mother worked at but was able to make a full recovery after my mom rushed her to the vet. 

Lucky grew really attached to me the day my mother brought her home and she has slept on my bed with me every night for years since then.

I can hear her purring softly as I roll onto my side, outstretching both my hands so as to stroke her back and massage her ears. She looks at me approvingly with her tired eyes, squinting, soaking up the attention I'm giving her. 

As both of my hands move from her head, and down her side, I notice a foreign and dark shadow rise up from the floor behind her, on the far side of my bed. My ears begin to buzz, I can feel them twitch back on the sides of my head and my eyes widen as a large beast as big as a grizzly escapes from the shadow, slamming its large hairy hands down on top of mine. 

Lucky struggles beneath my hands, I can feel her eyes boring into my face, but my gaze is fixated on the large yellow eyes of the grinning beast. A look of extreme satisfaction crosses its almost human face as it stretches its neck down to watch me. 

I struggle to pull my hands out from under the creatures weight. The bones in my palm begin to separate as the pressure of the creature bear down on them, pulling apart the ligaments. Lucky lets out a terrible screeching sigh as the air is crushed from her lungs.

I can feel the life smashed from Lucky as her ribcage and body pop and snap like popcorn beneath my hands. Soon, probably only seconds, her strangled cries stop and her mouth hangs agape showing her long sharp canine teeth protruding in an unnatural grimace, her dark lifeless eyes wide with terror.

I close my own eyes at the sight and wrench my arms to me with all of my might, tearing them out from under the beasts grip I am propelled onto my back.

My eyes open, staring at my dimly lit ceiling, my heart thundering in my chest. I blink and come to the realization that this was all just a dream. In my mind I know she died naturally almost six years ago before I left home for college but I still lift myself up with my arms behind me, to make sure she is OK.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g5or1/lucky_lucky/

47,Dream I Just Had,1300331989,"I am not sure if anyone here is good at  interpreting dreams, but it would be nice if anyone here would have any idea what this dream meant.

In the dream I order pizza like I have done on many occasions in the past. One thing that is different than normal life is that there are many people in my house who are not normally there. The pizza takes longer than normal to deliver. People start to complain. When I hear a knock on the door I hear someone in the house say finally it is here. I open the door and the first thing I notice is that it is dark outside and the porch light is off. I think to myself this is unusual because I always turn the porch light on when I expect anyone to come to the door. I reach for the switch to turn the light on, but before I get a chance to hit the switch the ""driver"" gets in my face and starts screaming. It does not sound like a human or anything I have heard on this planet before. I wake up not scared but confused. I could not see any facial features on the driver. It just looked like a shadow in the dark.

I hope someone can offer some insight to this very strange dream.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g5m20/dream_i_just_had/
48,Slender Man Origin(s) - Short Story,1300328103,"I have cross-posted this to both r/Slender_Man and r/redditstories. I know that sounds like I'm trying a little too hard, but I'd really like some more feedback.

Last October I wrote a short story that was an attempt at the ""origin"" of one of Reddit's favorite nightmare-inducing phantasms. I tried not to paint Slendy as something having a definitive origin, but more as a force that could be contained. I tried to suggest that Slender Man is something malevolent and eternal and that this ""origin"" was one of many different tales of him being released from captivity.

I know that Reddit gets inundated with Slender Man stuff, so I avoided posting this to NoSleep for awhile. I wrote the story a few months ago, set it aside, and would like to try and revise it and fix whatever problems it may have.

I'm not looking for karma, I'm looking for criticism. It's a little lengthy at 21 pages. I'd implore any one of you to give it a read and let me know what you think.

Thanks.

49,Does it run in the family?,1300314675,"When my grandfather was a young man, he served with the Allied forces in France.  Right before he came back home, he was wounded pretty badly and lost a chunk of his calf.  He was feverish and delusional with pain, and was visited by a stranger.  The man wasn't wearing a uniform; he was in a nice black suit and hat.  He spoke with an American accent.

""Would you like some help?""

Right then and there, my grandfather knew that he was dying.  The man didn't repeat himself, just stood there staring at my grandfather.  He waited for an answer until my grandfather finally worked up a ""No.""

So, the man said, ""I'll return later to see if that is still the case.""

My grandfather went home, recovered, married, had a family, and never saw the man again.

When my father was in high school, he thought he was going to marry his high school sweetheart, the only girl he had ever dated at that point.  But she had other plans.  She turned down his proposal entirely, and broke up with him.

He went on a drive down to a creek in his hometown.  Crossing the creek is easy, because there are these large rocks in it that are close enough together for even a kid to jump.  But it had rained a lot that spring, and he slipped while crossing and banged his chin up pretty badly on one of the rocks, he still has the scar from it.  But he was a little dazed, and almost slipped the first time he tried to stand up.  That was when he saw that he wasn't alone.

There was a wirey man standing on the other side of the creek bank.  He wore a dark suit--this town was pretty rural then so nobody wore suits like that unless it was a wedding or a funeral.  

""Would you like some help?"" the man asked.

My dad says he didn't sound threatening or anything.  His voice was somewhat clipped, but neutral.  But my dad thought he was going to die.  Even though the creek is so shallow that you'd really have to work at it to drown in it, my dad was sure that any moment he would be dead.  He gripped the rock he'd fallen face-first onto so hard that his fingernails bent back, and said ""No.""

So, the man said, ""I'll return later to see if that is still the case.""

The next time my dad looked up, he was gone.  My dad stayed out there for a long time.  At first, he had the crazy notion that if he crossed to one side or the other, the man in the suit would get him, but if he was over the water he was safe.  (Once I tried to say that the whole thing was a product of him jostling his head on the landing, and I don't think I've ever gotten him so pissed off as that).  Eventually, he picked himself up and went home.

He went on to have a pretty normal life, and has never seen the man since.

When I was a senior in college, I was an arrogant little shit.  I had great grades, my med school acceptance, and thought I knew everything.  I still had a part time job as an EMT (I did the training and the job to bolster my med school application as they like that kind of thing).  One night on a call I was taking a patient's history, and he wasn't honest with me.  He didn't get the right treatment.  To be short, he died and I blamed myself even though I did everything ""right"" and even if he had told the truth, his case had so many complications that his outcome might have still been the same.  

I quit my job.  I hardly ever partied before because I was one of those one-track-mind dr or bust types.  But I didn't have it in me to be a doctor.  I couldn't handle it.  I ditched the med school plan and spent the last few weeks of my college career at the bottom of as many bottles as I could find.

I spent the summer couch surfing at my friends' places and drinking them dry.  What was I supposed to do?  Everything in my life had been to get me to med school, which was now the number one place I didn't want to go.

One night, I picked a fight with my host-of-the-moment.  He had a job that required mornings and I knew was getting ready to kick me out, but I wasn't ready to line up a new couch.  So, I just kind of picked the fight.  Not my proudest moment.  I ended up storming out like a bitch and going for a walk.  It was late and I wasn't completely sober, but it was a safe neighborhood.

When I got to the far side of his street, the part getting closer to the dead end, I noticed someone else's shadow with mine.  I turned around and saw him.

He was a thin guy in too nice of a suit for so late at night, and wearing a hat.  He was clean and well-put together.  He looked at me like I was on a slide under a microscope, and then something about his body language changed and made him seem like he was really sympathetic.  

""Would you like some help?"" he asked.

I wasn't afraid of him, and definitely didn't feel like I was about to die.  It was like everything in my life was meaningless shit, and he was the one man who could change it.  I took a step forward to him because I wanted to see his face more clearly.  The closer I got, the more sure I got.  He was someone who mattered.  He could give me some new life-path.  He was powerful, and I could be too.  I wanted to say yes, to find out what he could offer.

But deep down, I didn't want power.  The whole doctor power over life and death thing?  I couldn't handle that shit.  I said, ""No thanks, man, I'm good.""

So the man said, ""I'll return later to see if that is still the case.""

The next thing I remember of that night wasn't that night, it was the next morning throwing up everything I'd eaten in the past year, hung over as fuck, while my buddy tried to get ready for work around me.  

I rationalized it.  I was drunker than I had thought that night, and my brain invented the story using the stories my dad told me as inspiration.  But by the end of the summer, I'd cleaned up my act and was starting to move towards respectability, even if I wasn't sure exactly what my respectability would be yet.

It's been a only couple of years since then.  Life has been pretty ok.  I'm a lot luckier than most.  I'm married, with a stable job, but my partner keeps talking about adopting.  

I can't help but think.  The man said he'd return later.  If my (future) son isn't biologically mine, will that man come back?  What if my hypothetical son says yes to him?

Sometimes when I think these thoughts, it makes me feel like I'm dying.  My poor partner thinks I've just got cold feet about parenting, but really I just can't bring myself to share such an irrational story. 

And this has gone on way longer than I intended.  I don't even know why I'm posting it.

50,The Cabin - Day 4,1300310985,"Learn what lead up to this:

[Day 3: Part 1](http://redd.it/funvv)    
[Day 3: Part 2](http://redd.it/fx11b)    

There was a somber tone the next morning. The lake was calm, like it usually is in the mornings, but there was a slight fog rolling in. My dad was already up, a cup of coffee in his hand, though he just stood in the kitchenette staring out the window onto the lake. He was perfectly still. When the rest of us woke up and made our way into the main room of the cabin, none of us talked much. We were all concerned. My dad doesn’t get scared easily; truth is he loves a good thrill (Halloween is a special time of year for him and I). Whatever happened to him the other night truly scared him.

“Dad?” was the only thing I could ask him. He turned around, looked at all of us, sat down and started explaining what happened.

***

When the authorities arrived they immediately began blocking off the area. There were only three or four Troopers (aside from the Paramedics tending to my cousin), so they asked for volunteers to help search the area. My dad was one of those volunteers. They began with the hand that we had found. It was partially decomposed and severed from the main corpse which was found deeper in the mud. The body was too far gone to identify the person, but it was determined to be a female. Immediately the group decided to set up a gridded area to make searching easier. About a third of the grid covered the trail area, while the rest of the area covered an open field.

My dad and one of the Troopers started going further into the open area, side by side. Since it was so dark, they had a hard time seeing where they were going, even with flashlights in front of them. They could feel the ground beneath them getting soft, almost like moss. After some searching in the area, they reached the other end of the open area, where they stumbled upon an old log cabin, predating my family cabin by about sixty years. Curiosity got the better of both the trooper and my dad.

It turns out that this cabin belongs to an old hermit that lives in the woods. The entire resort knew about ‘that crazy guy’ that lived by himself in the woods, but they never confronted him; they just left him to himself. Even knowing this, the two pressed on (the Trooper having a gun on him was apparently more than enough protection…).

My dad held his light pointed to the cabin while the Trooper checked the windows. Nothing; it was pitch black. The Trooper proceeded to open the front door, slowly, creaking as it swayed inward. When my dad pointed his light inside for the Trooper, it was as if the darkness inside the cabin was completely absorbing the light. That’s when my dad saw it; a single pair of white eyes. He tried shining his light to see who was there, but that didn’t work; the light just vanished. He tried warning the Trooper. Whatever my dad had seen had paralyzed him (the Trooper).

Standing only a few feet away, my dad slowly started to back away. Those eyes turned into a second pair, then another. This continued until there were about ten sets of eyes; truth is my dad lost count. From the bottom of the doorway, he could see the darkness flowing out and around the Troopers feet. Then a pair of dark, black arms reached around his waist. A hand crept out and grabbed his head, two more taking his arms. Then he was gone. Whatever had taken hold of the Trooper had pulled him inside the cabin in the blink of an eye. The only sound was a short scream, instantly cut short. My dad ran as fast as he could.

***

I didn’t know how I was supposed to feel when he told us everything. Was I supposed to feel relieved? Scared? Worried? At the very least I was happy that my dad wasn’t hurt. The others in my family felt the same, but we all shared a deep concern inside. We knew we couldn’t stay any longer. At around Noon we started packing our things, hoping to leave by mid-afternoon. We would get home well after sunset, though we didn’t care. I sat at the campfire, crying. My mom came to get me when everything was packed. The others (my Aunt, Uncle, cousins and grandparents) had left just a few minutes before us, so everything was quiet. As we were leaving, the fog on the lake had gotten thicker and was rolling in.

The car stalled at the entrance to the lot. We weren’t leaving any time soon…

51,It's happening again.,1300298485,"It's happening again. I guess I knew it would. This time I suspected it was coming, but that didn't stop me from praying that it wouldn't.

It always starts the same, too. I feel it approaching me like a snake creeping up on a mouse which hasn't yet realised. Moving slowly, silently, deliberately. Even though I know it's getting closer, it doesn't seem to be coming from any direction. It finally envelopes me, becomes one with me. I can no longer tell where I stop and it begins.

I can feel it inside me and all around me. I'm too afraid to be scared, it senses my fear. If I let go now I know it will never leave me. All I can do is wait. It continues to move through me. Every inch of my body feels as though a million tiny hands are clawing at me, tearing my flesh from the inside out.

It's laughing at me now. It knows that it has almost beaten me. It knows because *I* know.

The voices haven't started yet but I know they're coming. I don't even know if you could describe them as voices, it sounds more like the wails of an injured cat building to a crescendo that never seems to arrive. But I definitely hear my name somewhere in that awful, rising sound. I can't even be sure if *it* is making the noise or I am.

I usually black out at that point, I'm fast approaching it now. I'll try my best to stay here, like I always do, but deep down I've already given in to it. No point fighting it any more.

I never know where I'll wake up. The first time it happened I came around while I was stood in the bathroom. For a full ten minutes I stood, staring at the mirror. It wasn't me looking back at myself. It was someone, or something, I didn't recognise. That was the night my mother died. The doctors weren't sure what killed her, they guessed that it was some sort of seizure. The most disturbing part was that she had scratched and clawed at her eyes and face to the point of being unrecognisable. 

I stopped feeling that day. Anger, love, sadness, even pain. The only time I feel anything now is when *it* takes over me. But these emotions aren't my own, they belong to the people that it's killed.

53,Late apologies:,1300283148,"Late apologies:

I'm not quite clear on the fine details but one particular incident is still fresh in my mind.

At the age of 11, I remember a night that still haunts me. My parents owned a coffee shop and had to close down early as there was no babysitter for me and it was a school night.

My dad decided to drive home an elderly man who was a regular customer. I remember seeing him in the shop, often alone in the corner, always at the same table. 

The man ordered the same thing every time ; coffee and a slice of apple pie that he never touched. I remember serval times when I asked him if I could have a bite, seeing that he never touched the plate or the utensil he so carefully placed on the table. Like clockwork, he would stare off in the distance and reply with a nod.

On the night we drove him home, I remember sitting in the backseat listening to him talk about his life. He told us about his family and how they would all come to our shop after he picked up his daughter from school.

"" One day "", he explained, ""I was late and was told that she was meeting me at the coffee shop. They found her school bag sitting in the alley behind the shop. I know she lost somewhere, scared and in need of her father. As long as I am here each day, she will have a safe haven in my presence.""

As he got out of the car, he looked up and stared at the second floor window, a stare much like the ones he did in the shop. I was told to remain in the car as my parents helped him in the house. With the doors locked and dead silent as company, my imagination started to run wild, or so I thought. 

In the distance, I could hear a nursery rhyme being hum which seemed to echo randomly in all directions. 

""Three little kittens, they lost their mittens…""

I covered my ears but it was no use, the singing seem to echo in my head. 

""Lost your mittens, you naughty kittens! Then you shall have no pie…""

The next thing I remember was being asked by my mother what song I was singing. Followed by a distance laughter by a child in the background.

57,Headphones,1300269473,"When I was a kid, I lived with my Mom, who was single. She'd come home from work a little after I'd come home from school, so I'd have about an hour or so to myself. I almost always spent the time gaming on my PC. My computer had a crappy set of speakers (I think they came with the computer at no extra cost), and I had a really nice pair of headphones, so naturally, I always chose the latter over the former.

One night, I was engrossed in a session of MapleStory, when I felt a hand grasp my shoulder firmly from behind. I screamed, jumped out of my seat, and turned around - and there was Mom. She laughed, and told me not to keep the volume so loud; I'd damage my ears. As if I'd ever consider turning it down. (What sort of kid isn't going to play loud music, right?)

I was startled by my Mom quite a few times after she came home, but soon I got used to the feeling of the hand grasping at my shoulder. It became something that I expected; just another part of my daily routine. And then, one day, I just barely heard her shout my name behind me. I turned around, and saw Mom walk into the hallway. I waved to her, and she smiled and said something about me finally taking her advice and turning the volume down - but actually, I had done no such thing.

As time went on, I'd hear the sound of my name being called clearer and clearer over the noise of my game. Eventually, I would be able to hear the distinctive sound of our lock opening as well.

And then, one night, I heard the lock click open about twenty minutes after I had arrived and locked it. Mom must be home a little early today, I thought. I paused my game and called out, ""Hi, Mom."" No response. That's strange, I thought. I walked over to the door, and it was shut. The lock was still closed.

A few days later, I heard my Mom call my name from behind me. I thought it was odd that I didn't hear the lock click open, like I almost always did at this point. I turned around, and nobody was home.

This would happen more and more frequently as time went on. I never believed in ghosts, but what more evidence of a haunted apartment could there be? Locks clicking open, invisible people mimicking your Mom's voice, calling your name... I was starting to believe.

Fast forward a few years. I was about 17 years old, and cellphones were now commonplace. [News stories about phantom vibrations](http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-06-12-cellphones_N.htm) were being published. This explained everything perfectly! At first, I couldn't hear the lock opening, or even my Mom shouting my name, when I was wearing the headphones. Over time, my brain got more and more adept at hearing and recognizing those sounds - until it became so sensitive to them, that it started picking up false positives. The mystery that had scared me for so many years was finally solved. I laughed to myself for being so stupid, and actually starting to believe in ghosts.

My routine hadn't changed much over the years. I would still get home from school a little earlier than my Mom, I'd still play games with my headphones on, and I'd still have to check to see whether or not the voice calling my name or the key turning the lock was real. But now, I wasn't scared anymore, because I knew that it was just my brain sending out faulty signals.

Then, one day, I heard a knock on the door. It was a fast succession of quick knocks, that was just barely audible. I opened the door, and nobody was there. I figured it was probably some kids playing a prank. I didn't consider the possibility of it being one of my usual false positives, because I wasn't used to hearing knocking. (We almost never had visitors, and when we did, almost everyone used the doorbell, so knocking was an extremely rare occurrence.)

A few days later, the knocking started again, but this time it was louder, and at a more moderate pace. I checked the door. Again, nobody was there.

Every couple of days, I'd hear the knocking, each time getting louder and slower. I was starting to get a little creeped out, but I was mainly just pissed; I still assumed that it was kids playing a prank. The fact that they would do it whenever I was wearing my headphones could easily be explained by the fact that they'd get together and do it at the same time each day - a time which just happened to fall within the hour or so I'd spend with my headphones on, waiting for my Mom to come home.

But one day, the knocking made me jump out of my seat. It couldn't really be called knocking at this point; it sounded more like someone was taking a battering ram to the door. It was certainly as loud as one, if not louder, and the speed of the slams had also slowed to a battering-ram pace. After a few strikes, the sound stopped. I checked the door. Again, there was nothing. I thought about calling the police, but decided against it when I saw that there was no visible damage done to the door.

It was only a few more days before the slamming started up again. This time was different, though. This time, I was expecting it. I muted my game, turned around, and faced the hallway that led to the door. The slams were louder and slower than ever before. Huge, reverberating thumps seemed to almost shake the entire apartment. It lasted for what seemed to me like almost a full minute.

And then, I heard the lock click open.

I swallowed, trying to get my parched throat wet enough to speak. I hesitated for a bit, then finally called out, ""Mom? Is that you?""

A voice - a *man's* voice, gravely and coarse - shouted back.

""No.""

This was the only time in my entire life that I've felt my fight-or-flight response kick in and say ""fight."" Without even thinking, I ripped off my headphones, grabbed an empty glass bottle off of the table by the neck, smashed the base of the bottle against the wall until it shattered, and charged towards the door with my improvised weapon.

Nobody was there. But this time was different.

This time, the door was unlocked.

I have never worn headphones since that day.",nosleep,Pufflekun,/r/nosleep/comments/g51ix/headphones/
58,Pure evil woke me one night...,1300257271,"I have been living in this house for 4 years now and have been experiencing things for the last 2 years of this time, although, the last 6 months have been pretty quiet since we had someone come bless the place and smudge it.  

The weird thing is, this house is a relatively new house and was built in 2003. Nobody has died in this house and when the home was built by my Dad, he made sure there were no graves or anything like that being dug up when he was digging the foundation.  

Rewind to roughly two years ago when a lot of paranormal stuff was just getting going pretty heavy with everyone living here.  It had been happening for about 4 months.  We would hear things like people sighing, heavy breathing, whispers right in your ear and what would look like movement out of the corner of your eyes.  It was just enough to make you think that it was your imagination or even yourself breathing heavy sometimes. Weird stuff, you know? Things that would make you say to yourself, ""I must have left the lights on"" or ""I wonder why I didn't close the refrigerator before I went outside"".  Anyone would use logic and think it was themselves who would be responsible for such trivial things.  But, then it stepped things up a notch, things like the remote controls would disappear for days at a time and then show up right in the middle of the dresser or laying in the floor, Coke cans would fall off the table when you turned your head, the TV would turn off or the volume would go all the way up and then back down again, ashtrays would fly off the table.  Things started happening that DIDN'T make logical sense now.   

It happened progressively. After a few more months we started to get touched by people who weren't there, hit, we had our hair pulled, we would hear sinister laughing from unisex voices and the shadows were now even more prevalent.  Since this was my parent's house and it was available, I rented an apartment in the basement of this house and had my uncle from out of town staying with me during this time.  One night I went down after hanging with my parents and couldn't find my uncle anywhere.  I went outside and saw his truck and knew he didn't go anywhere, but I still couldn't find him.  I decided to walk up to his truck.  He was inside, laying on the seat sleeping in the freezing cold winter night !  To this day he wouldn't tell me what happened to him down there that night that made him go sleep in his truck outside, but I'm sure it was bad.  After long, we had had enough and we contacted some investigators to come out and our case was investigated and documented by The Greater Maryland Paranormal Society.  They came out here twice and definitely found out that there was something going on in this place, but what?  Nobody knew.  

One day the paranormal group came down to revel some evidence they found from the previous investigation they had done here.  We were listening to it in the kitchen when all of a sudden I heard a sickly cough coming from a spare bedroom I slept in when things got bad downstairs in my apartment.  Then it happened again and another time once more ! It was a really nasty, gargle type deep cough and when my brother and I went to investigate, nothing ! Nobody around.  The investigator's eyes started bugging out, this was something he loved.  As soon as he started to record the cough, it stopped.  So he proceeded with the ""reveal"", which is showing us what they captured on voice recorders and video.  It was a lot, let me tell you.  

Whatever it was that the investigators did that day, sure as hell stirred up the paranormal that night.  They really didn't like hearing themselves on tape and I figure that they hated that they were ""found out about"".  That night is when it happened to me. 

Everything was quiet that evening, I was staying in the spare bedroom that night watching TV.  Nothing happened that evening.  Not until I went to sleep that is.  The first wake up was around 1 am. when I thought I heard whispering.   As soon as you open your eyes though, it stops.  So after a few minutes of listening, I passed back out and then again around 2 am I hear this weird droning noise, kinda like an old man moaning, but it wasn't really all that loud and it was coming from....I don't know.....the headboard I'm thinking ?!?! ""Weird as hell"", I thought ! I was awake for about 5 seconds this time before it stopped, so I knew I wasn't dreaming these sounds this time I was awoken. I finally get back to sleep and a few hours go by before anything else happens.  I was laying on my left side facing my closet door, the door was about 5 feet away from me.  At exactly 4:10am my eyes instantly popped open and as soon as they did, the sound started, it was this loud groan that, at first, sounded like someone snoring, but then it changed.  I popped up while holding myself up on my left elbow looking at the closet, the TV is on mute in the background, so I had a little bit of light in the room and this sound kept going and going.  Gradually this groan turned into this deep, deep, bass type....growl! I'm looking around the room wondering....what. the. hell???  But the growl kept coming.  I have to say, if Satan growls, it would probably sound like this growl I was hearing. Think of the deepest ""death metal"" growl you've heard and you'll have some idea. Parts of the growl were so low I could feel it in my chest ! I'm scared out of my mind by this point.  

Here I am, as vulnerable as I can be as I lay in bed with just shorts on, no weapon (not knowing what I would even do even if I had one, because, what is there to hit), nothing to protect me and there is this evil sound coming out of my closet that is five feet in front of me ! I'm petrified, but I find the courage to jump out of bed, open the door of the bedroom and just as I'm about to run out, I see two dark shadows to my right, like they were standing up to my door listening in to what was going on inside, as if they were mocking me.  The shadows took off faster than the speed of light and I make a break for it to my left and run down the hall into my brother's room.  I open the door hoping to tell him what the hell just happened to me and HE'S NOT IN THERE !!  He had stayed at his girlfriend's that night, so I'm in the room right next door, by myself once more !  I turn on all the lights, TV and after about ten minutes I carefully crack the door of the room and call my dog into the room from God knows where she was hiding.  I literally sat up against the door that night using a shoe as a pillow and waited for the sun to rise.  Oddly, I remember hearing some sort of odd feedback or angelic music coming out of the register/vent in the floor, which comes from the ductwork downstairs in the basement.  It was barely audible, but very beautiful music.  I don't know what that was, but it was comforting. I thought that maybe it was something of a good entity telling me things will be alright. 

All of this really happened and I reported it to the paranormal folks a few days later and they are keeping it in their case files.  I sit here now, typing, just a few feet from the bedroom that this all happened in, wondering if this pure evil entity or entities that seemed to hide in my closet and outside my door that night will ever come back.  I pray it won't. ",nosleep,sniggity,/r/nosleep/comments/g4z2y/pure_evil_woke_me_one_night/
59,The woman with the stroller. ,1300256870,"Around ten years ago my family used to live in one of those really fancy developments. You know the type, where every house looks the same and the kids rarely go play outside, even on a beautiful spring day. Though our house was situated at the very back of our development, our back yard was right in front of the cross town bike path. Living so close to the path gave me a lot of freedom as a kid, since nearly every other area of town was accessible by this path. Naturally you'd have some bad seeds sneaking out on the bike path, smoking weed or drinking their parents liquor as to not get caught, but for the most part this path was quite safe. 

One beautiful Saturday afternoon in April I asked if I could ride to my friend's house. She said it was fine as long as I got home before dark. The ride there was quite uneventful, aside from seeing my crush and being far too nervous to say hi. Once I got to my friend's house we decided to play N64, which was completely awesome aside from the fact I always got the shitty mad catz controller. 
The hours sure had a way of passing us by when our minds were soaked into the tv. I got up to get another box of cheez-its only to realize that it was 645 already. I told my friend I had to get going, strapped on my helmet, and started pedaling as fast as my little legs could. 

Pedaling down the trail at night was always scary, and the fact that my adrenaline was already pumping from being late only made me more scared. As the sun kissed the horizon, a sense of dread filled me. I was never late, and I didn't know what the consequences would be if I ever was. I was staring down at my tires, since I was standing up pedaling, and right when I looked up I saw an old woman with a stroller.  I panicked, and in an effort to not destroy the young child I whipped my handle bars to the left and flew over them, into the bushes.
While still climbing out of the bushes, I was apologizing so fast to the old woman I was quite sure she couldn't make out a single word I was saying. Scrambling to my feet I looked at her and said I was sorry, only to find she wasn't looking back at me, she was just staring straight ahead. She seemed nice enough at first, her long gray hair curling at the ends, almost as if they were trying to frame her face. The deep sunken wrinkles at the edges of her mouth almost looked like cracks in pavement. While waiting for a response I started to notice other things about her appearance. The nails on her fingers were split down the middle, almost on every digit, and her old battered dress had definitely seen better days. I glanced down at the stroller she was pushing, only to find a small plastic doll where a baby should be. 

The doll itself was quite unsettling. The head had such a light dusting of hair on it the doll looked almost bald.  It's skin was not a healthy looking color, and it's features were distorted and asymmetrical. The clothes it was wearing had lots of holes, and it was only wearing one sneaker. Though it hardly looked human it had a certain energy to it, which made it seem more alive than it should have seemed. Then, a twitch.  Not a big one, but still noticeable. 

I heard a creaking noise, almost like the snapping sound a sapling makes, and with that it's head started to turn. Slow at first, it completely shifted it's face toward me. As I fell back in sheer terror I had noticed that the old womans head had also turned toward me, eyes rolled back in her head. The way she moved made her seem like a puppet, almost like in an old Godzilla movie. The doll started creaking again, revealing a horrid smile filled with half rotting teeth, as did the woman. Her maggot infested mouth disgusted me even more than the doll, as they started crawling through the holes in her front teeth. I yanked my bike out of the bushes, crying and panting and driveling snot all over my shirt, all the while I could feel his beady fucking porcelain eyes boring holes right through me. 
The punishment I got later that night was received with my complete numbness from being in shock, though I think my mother thought I was just being disrespectful.  I couldn't sleep at all that night; every time I closed my eyelids I saw the disgusting rotten smile the old woman had. 

Needless to say I sure as hell never came home late again.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g4yyw/the_woman_with_the_stroller/

""I imagined Marine dead had risen up and were moving silently about the the area. I suppose these were nightmares, and i must have been more asleep than awake, or just dumbfounded by fatigue. The pattern,was always the same. The dead got up slowly out of their waterlogged craters or off the mud and, with stooped shoulders and dragging feet, wandered around aimlessly, their lips moving as though trying to tell me something. I struggled to hear what they were saying. They seemed agonized by pain and despair. I felt they were asking me for help. The most horrible thing was that thing was that i felt unable to aid them.

At that point i invariably became wide awake and felt sick and half crazed by the horror of my dream. I would gaze out intently to see if the silent figures were still there, but saw nothing.

61,Let us in,1300254910,"I live in a house-turned-apartment in a small suburb in Pennsylvania, on the ground floor, first apartment on the left as you walk up the steps and go through the front door.  It's a hazy, overcast afternoon.  The first in a long while that it hasn't rained.  My arms are full of grocery bags as I go through the front door, then the door to my apartment.  My boyfriend is at the gym, but he should be getting back soon.

Loud, erratic knocking startles me as I set the groceries down on the table.  I can see through the window on the door that they aren't in the hallway.  They must be outside.  I wonder if there's been an accident or something else outside, why else would they not come into the apartment to find someone?

I open the front door.  At the bottom of the steps are three young dark-skinned kids.  My senses suddenly become sharply acute, aware, and something in the far reaches of my mind feels threatened.  My fingers trace the deadlock on the door as I ask, ""Can I help you?""

""Let us come in.""  Not a question.  His voice feels heavy in the cool air.  Their eyes are too terrifying for me to look into without fearing for my sanity.

""Who are you looking for?""

""We'll know once you let us come inside.""

I want to look around, to see if there's a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk or kids playing in the park.  But I worry about the consequences of taking my eyes off of them, and the lack of ambiance that indicates human existence outside reaffirms what my subconscious is so absolutely scared of.

""I don't think anyone in here can help you,"" I tell them, slowly closing the door, keeping them in my vision.

""_We need you to tell us that we can come inside._"" The door seems to snag on the carpet.  I look down briefly to see what caused it to get stuck.  When I look back up seconds later, all three of them had started up the steps.  They seemed to have frozen mid stride, one foot on the step closest to the door.  The boy in the middle had his hand outstretched, reaching for the door handle.

""You can't come in.""  I shut the door and lock it.  I avoid looking out the window.  I go into the farthest room from the front door, and I sit down.  My senses are hyper active, picking up on the smallest of noises and the slightest shifts in the air.

A car door slamming shut.  My boyfriend, thank goodness.  I slowly get up to greet him at the door.  I hear his voice in the hallway.

64,"Mirror, mirror",1300249032,"I lived alone in a one bedroom apartment about an hour away from home after graduating from college. The distance was far enough to give me a sense of independence and close enough to keep me comfortable. I loved feeling like I was finally out in the real world, standing on my own two feet. Furnishing my new home was at the top of my list when I moved and I was pretty ecstatic to have a place with my own personal style. Dark hardwood, long curtains, and elegant chairs- I loved anything with a vintage feel to it. At the first thrift shop I stepped foot in, I impulse bought a very aged looking mirror. The glass was a bit dirty and the framing was worn, but I knew if I polished it up, it would be the most eye catching piece in my living space. The carvings were beautiful and intricate in a way that you knew only a skilled hand could have crafted it. There was a pretty hefty price attached to it, but...I had to have it!

After weeks of struggling to find a place, and moving everything I owned, the apartment was finally perfected and all my belongings were unpacked. I was at the peak of happiness with my brand new start in life. As soon as things settled and seemed to run smoothly, I was struck with little bouts of illness. At first, there would just be small headaches that turned into painful, throbbing ones. I ignored those for a while as I still had to go to my job in order to pay bills for my new home. Eventually, I woke up feeling sick every morning. I would look at the mirror to see a pale visage staring straight back at me. My legs and arms were weak and I would start sweating from overheating even if it was cold outside. People at work started becoming concerned for not only my well-being but theirs as well so I was forced to take a sick leave.

I started staying home, confined to my bed and vomiting whatever contents I could get into my stomach. I would look at my reflection and see dark circles under my eyes with skin so pale that I could have been mistaken for a corpse. My sister started coming from an hour away to check up on me. In my state of feeling like utter shit, I remember complaining about the creepiness of my appearance all the time and she would just brush me away with a “you're exaggerating!” 

As the days passed, I became worse and worse. My family wanted to bring me to see a doctor, but I didn't have medical care at that time and I really didn't want to be spending any more money when I wasn't working. It had been just two months since I moved in. I would look in the beautiful mirror every night to see a not so beautiful image. I would see my gaunt cheeks and blank eyes staring back at me. The circles under my eyes just grew darker and larger. I was starting to panic about my deteriorating health and finally caved in to going to the hospital. It struck me as odd that my family wasn't more persistent about visiting a doctor when I looked so ghastly. The features that stared back at me were terrible enough that I knew it wouldn't just go away. My sister, the worry wart, should have been the most pushy about bringing me to the hospital. 

I was getting ready to see the light of day for the first time in a while. My weak fingers tried to button my shirt and I sighed as I surveyed my appearance. I never knew my eyes could look so dark.

“Are you ready yet-” My sister stop in her tracks. Color drained out of her face until she was completely white. 

“What?”

“Th...That's not what you look like.”

I looked back at my reflection that had not moved an inch when I turned to look at my sister.

65,Nearsighted,1300234861,"Update conversation with my sister [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g634u/update_to_nearsighted_story_convo_with_my_sister/)

When I was around 8-9, my distance vision started getting pretty bad.  My sister and I got eye appointments once a year, but when you're young, I guess your vision can change a lot within the course of a few months.  We had also recently moved to a different town into an older (but large) house and I can’t remember if we even had a new eye doctor yet.  However, like other kids this happens to, the change was gradual enough that I didn't really notice it (I could still read because it was nearsightedness) and my parents didn’t notice probably because they were too busy with the move and changing jobs, etc.  I was definitely scooting quite close to the TV if I had to read anything on the screen and I couldn't tell people's expressions from more than a few feet away.  Basically, instead of realizing I actually had a vision problem, I just found other ways to cope…for example, I started really paying attention to how people move when they walk, etc.  The more difficult part was trying to figure out my parents’ expressions when they were saying stuff to make sure they didn’t have a disapproving look like I was about to get in trouble.  I think I started subconsciously smiling and giving a little wave whenever I saw one of them from across the room, even though I had no idea what their mood was.  


One night, my sister and I (she’s only a year and a few months younger than me) were in our large shared bedroom and we were really excited because our grandma had just sent us several new Barbies with clothes for Easter.  It was supposed to be bedtime, but my sister wanted to play with them, so we were on the floor playing by the light of our fairly bright nightlight.  I looked up toward our half-open door and our dad was there watching us.  I thought oh crap, it’s probably past midnight, we’re making too much noise and we’re going to get in trouble for staying up and playing this late, so I gave my little smile that I always gave even though I couldn’t see how angry he was by his expression, and my sister just stared at him wide-eyed.  I guess we were both anticipating the scolding, and I was ready to blame her and jump straight into bed.  But he calmly just turned away and went on his way down the hall.  I was utterly shocked that we didn’t get in trouble and I turned to my sister with a big grin and said “I guess dad isn’t mad” and she was still frozen looking at the door, and she whispered “That man wasn’t dad.”  


I immediately got goosebumps everywhere and that sinking stomach pit and I grabbed her arm and we ran and hid behind the bunkbed.  I asked her if she was sure it wasn’t dad, and she said it was an old man with gray hair and he wasn’t even looking at us, just into the room.  Of course we start crying and freaking out and making ourselves as small as possible behind the bed for what felt like hours.  We eventually fell asleep out of exhaustion there.    


She told our parents the next morning, but they said it was our overactive imaginations, even though I tried to confirm it for her (although I KNOW my mom made my dad walk around the whole house and check it out while we were eating breakfast).  Anyway, that incident made me think back to several other occasions since moving in.  Sometimes my dad would come home late from his new job, so he’d be pretty tired the next day.   I’d see him through the French doors a few rooms over in his office room (the downstairs was a pretty open layout) and I’d smile and wave from the kitchen or living room, but he was so blurry that I couldn’t tell if he was smiling back, but he wouldn’t wave, so I’d just assume he was making a funny face at me like he always did, so I’d smile even bigger towards him, then go back to what I was doing.  Once in awhile when this would happen, he would just seem off…like I could tell he wasn’t smiling or making a funny face even though I couldn’t see him clearly, and he seemed too thin, but I had always assumed he was really tired and a little hunched over and just ignoring me those times.  I think I’ll email my sis and ask if she remembers seeing him after that, but she was too scared to talk about it much after that night and the next morning.  We did not stay up late playing after that incident either.

66,Creepy dream I had last night has left me feeling scared,1300231930,"So I had a freaky dream last night. I have very vivid dreams, sometimes several a night that I can remember and the memory fades as the day goes on so I want to write this out before it startes to fade.

It started out I was part of a group of students. We'd been advised that we were up for a session of disciplinary action that could only be described as bizarre and cruel. We were to be locked inside a large room with some sort of creature that was going to eat us alive then we were to be ressurected shortly after. 

They gave us a ""last day"" of fun to be had before we were killed and I was freaking out. Everyone else was so calm about it. They didn't seem to think it was an issue, even the parents of the children were OK with it. I remember flying around (I can always fly in my dreams) trying to find a way out of this situation. I went looking for waepons or anything I could use to survive or fight my way out. 

I was put in a line of students later in my dream and we were shuffled onto a bus where we were to be transported to the ""room"". Everyone was so calm but I was angry. VERY angry.

We were dropped off at an old house where we were told we were to be given a last meal. On the wall of the house was a list of all the students and what they had done to deserve to be put to ""death"". I had simply played Nine Inch Nails on my iPod. That was it. I was furious and started confronting the teachers about this telling them I wasn't going through with the punishment. 

I ran out of the house and jumped into the lake and began to swim away. I felt like this was my only way out. People started shooting at me and a teacher jumped in after me, following me closely. I saw a large figure move towards me under the water and it was some sort of giant eel, mouth open, ready to devour me. 

Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, I spun around and kicked whoever it was and woke up mid kick. I kicked my fiance in the back. Poor guy.

This dream has really left me feeling shaken. The feeling of dread and imminent death. The fear of being eaten alive and how casual everyone was about it. I feel awful. ",nosleep,ilovewandy,/r/nosleep/comments/g4r3e/creepy_dream_i_had_last_night_has_left_me_feeling/

By that moment I was already on the street running for my life when it began to fill with monsters and abominations.

31.3 seconds after the first injection I almost ran into a car but I couldn't stop, my body isn't responding anymore.

132.0 seconds after the first injection I noticed that the time is moving slower than it normally does, maybe its because of the poison but I am sure its because of the creeps that control my body. Even if the time is moving slower something managed to grab me from behind. Its a black shape with the head of a wasp. I tried to fight but the it was stronger and I couldn't use one of my hands since there was were I got the injection.

133.7 seconds after the first injection I get a second shot. The sting landed on the back of my neck but this one was different, like a burning spot or the byte of hundreds of needles. The convulsions started immediately.

924.3 seconds after the first injection I lie down in a totally black room surrounded by animals larger than me. I can't move, the fear have take control of my body, they are gathering around me ready for the gorge on my flesh.
I hear them creeping around, they communicate by squeals which I can't understand. Please wake up, this is a bad dream just wake up. Move a little, blink once and then try to keep your eyes shut until you wake up. Then I began to feel one of them crawling a web around my hand. Why is she doing it? I am sure my hand is already digested for the poison I can't feel my fingers anymore. Maybe she planted eggs there. Dear god what is this wetness on my scar? I need to get this hand off me.

Please hand fall down I don't need you anymore I am sorry but you need to unlock yourself. Why aren't you listening? Move body, we need to take that hand off before its too late. Move a little, blink once and then keep moving until the hand fall off.

Blink please just once. Remember you are dreaming maybe if you blink you will wake up and your hand won't be there anymore. Just blink for me. Dear god I wanna get out of here, I wanna wake up or die but I don't wanna be in this room. Let me blink god let me do it. I just need a blink.

Its been almost eighteen seconds since the web tangling began. I can't see what animal is doing it since I haven't been able to move my neck. I just need to blink then I will be able to move my neck. No don't move your head you don't wanna see. Just blink for now. One, two, BLINK! God dammit why I can't blink? Now I can't breath, my lungs like the rest of my body paralyzed on fear. How much time is needed to die on suffocation? 150 seconds maybe more.

In this condition that means an eternity. Any regrets? Maybe its not the proper time to think about my last words now that I can't talk but at least it will kill some time. Ok let me think I wish I had been more organized and maybe this wouldn't have happened. I think I owe an apology to my father since he was right, I can't survive alone. Any last word for mom? I am sorry I didn't answered your calls, I love you but sometimes people do stupid things. I want to tell my friend that there is a giant scorpion in the house. Don't try to kill it, better get out and torch the house down, I am sure the landlord will understand when you explain it. How much time it was? Three seconds maybe I hope it was more. Ok begin to count just count slowly until you die. One, two, three, four, five, six... seventy, seventy one, seventy two, seventy three, seventy four... five hundred nine, five hundred ten, five hundred eleven...

No please lungs don't do this to me now. Stay as you are, don't breath. Listen to me don't fucking breath. Let me die, please just let me die. But they don't listen to me and let a mouthful of air pass throw. Why did you do that? Why can't you let me die? Suddenly I notice that I am weeping on despair but one of my eyes is closed.
I blinked I finally did. C'mon one more time, I can do it. Concentrate on this you have nothing else to do. Somehow I managed to blink again this time with both eyelids. Good job, now concentrate more, tell your hand to fall down already. Move it first, you have to move it. Do it just like before. Maybe the poison messed up my brain more than I expected because the more I tried to move my hand the more my lungs got excited. Then try to move your legs or your eyebrows, just keep trying to move until you get a response.

1040.3 seconds since the first injection I see a head with more than three eyes. They noticed that I began to react. I am scared I can't blink anymore. Concentrate move your hand, move it now! I can't move my hands but my right knee is responding. I need to get out. I try to use just my knee to impulse my entire body but that doesn't work. Its ironic that from their perspective I must look like an insect giving its final kicks.

One of them put their legs around my good arm I don't know what happened next but I think my lungs reacted in something that wasn't a scream. Its like they exhaled all the air at once but I couldn't emit a sound. My arm reacted and tried to set free, I am so proud of him maybe not all my body is as stubborn as I though. Now my arm can move. I am not commanding him, it just moves without my permission. I can feel how it tried to reach my other hand and rip it apart. I can feel the tendons and muscles tiding but its in vain. Before my arm could rip my hand, they sting me again.

Once again I can't blink, I can't even feel my eyelids anymore. Maybe this time they did kill me.

Thanks god.

26 hours after the first injection. I wake up in a hospital room with a bandage on my hand and an intravenous on my other arm. My friend visited me as soon as the nurse told him I was awake. He was happy because he found the scorpion that did this to me and showed me the body inside a ziploc. But that wasn't my scorpion. Mine was bigger, much bigger. I could even see its the red eyes while it was piercing me. Maybe there is a nest or something somewhere.

6 days after the first injection. I need to sting painkillers in my arm to not get crazy, after that my world feels heavy and its hard to move, the times goes slower than it usually does. I try to blink as much as I can while the painkiller wears off like if I am going to convince myself its not the same thing I felt before.

But what I hate the most is my hand. It aches and stinks but its bandaged and I can't see inside. The doctors said that I will keep a big scar but that is not the problem, I can still feel the little spiders crawling throw my flesh. This hand needs to fall down.",nosleep,Faryshta,/r/nosleep/comments/g4p5p/the_injection/
68,Cottage.,1300208024,"I was staying with my friend, because the ferries were shut down, and there was no other way to get off the island- unless I wanted to take a kayak, and cross to the mainland in the icy storm that even the ferries wouldn't brave.

Her family was rich. Two houses and a cottage, all on a huge acreage. They told me I could sleep in the cottage near the back of the property- We all knew that I was going to be stuck there for a while. So I took my things, and took the snowmobile to the cottage.

It was wonderful- Cute, like a fairy tale, tucked away in an icy blur of the country. There was wood piled up outside for the wood-burning stove, and the place was small enough to heat up fast.

I went in, unpacked my things, said goodbye to my friend, who took the snowmobile back to the main house. She disappeared from my sight in moments, the snow obscuring her. I shivered, but not due to the cold.

The stove lit the house in around half an hour, and I soon had a cup of tea and a bit of food ready for me, set on the tiny kitchen table. The table looked out onto the woods behind the cottage, sat in front of an unusually large window that showed black skeletons of burnt trees(there had been a fire, 50 years ago. Nothing had grown. It didn't strike me as odd, at the time.), the snow seemingly lighter on this side of the cottage. The trees looked odd, man-shaped. I put it out of my head.

Drowsy from the sudden warmth and the food, I went to search for my bed.

Another huge window dominated the bedroom, still staring at the dead forest. There was no snow falling, now. The branches were unnervingly close to my cottage. Closer than before.

I put it out of my head, and fell into a light sleep. The trees tapped against my window all night long. 

When I woke up, it was snowing again. I couldn't see the trees. My friend arrived an hour later, ready to take me back. She said the ferries were running again. For some reason, I didn't want to go. I was tired, and didn't feel like going out into the cold- Except for maybe a walk, later. I wanted to take some photos in the forest.

She made me leave.

It didn't strike me how odd this was until I was riding away from the cottage, and looked back- At the huge shadows of cedars, looming over the cottage. But that isn't the point- Inside the cottage, someone was standing at the front window, looking at me. I tightened my grip on her, silently urging her to speed up.

My friend died last month. Murdered in her own home.",nosleep,trillian_andtheghost,/r/nosleep/comments/g4ieg/cottage/
69,Brian,1300207956,"In college I lived in a small two story house that had been broken up into two apartments. The bottom floor was a 3 bedroom where three of my friends lived and the top story was an apartment shared by me and another girl.

I don't remember how long into my stay at the house things started happening, but I do remember that it was fairly early on. My bedroom was the largest room in the house, and was directly over the first floor living room. Being that it was so large and on the second floor the room had closets where the ceiling sloped down. Three closets to be exact. One night, not too long after moving into the house I woke up suddenly to all three closet doors opening and shutting simultaneously, this did not stop all night and continued to happen nearly once a week for the next two years I lived in the house. 

It was next when we were approaching Fall Break, my apartment mate and I left town for the long weekend, but the three people who lived downstairs stayed in town. Apparently every evening around 5 or 6pm from the downstairs living room one could hear large heavy things in my bedroom above being shoved around the room, foot steps always across the floor and doors opening an slamming. This would go on for about 20-30minutes before stopping suddenly. Every time one of the girls downstairs would check to see if I or my house-mate had come back, but the door to the upstairs would still be locked.

After this break the five of us gathered in the living room to discuss what was going on. We decided plainly, trying to laugh off the strange things happening up stairs, that we had a ghost and his name was Brian. 

After naming 'him' when we would come home late at night, or to an empty house we would greet Brian saying things like ""Hey Brian! I'm home!"" or talk to him when the house was eerie. 

The closets in my room continued to open and slam on their own, and things continued to sound as if they were being moved in my room when no one was there (I heard this on a few occasions when I was watching movies downstairs).

Then we started talking about Brian amongst ourselves, mainly joking, saying he was fat or stupid or really anything insulting for really no reason.

One evening we were talking in the living room when one of the downstairs girls was talking about how fat and ugly Brian must be while eating a carrot stick. Not a second after she finished her sentence her carrot was knocked out of her hand and 10 feet across the room. We stopped trash talking Brian.

That night I went to bed early a little shaken but not scared. As a lay in my bed I heard a voice right next to my ear say ""Hey, hey what're you doing? What's going on? What're you doing?"" repeated over and over again. I got out of bed assuming it was a house-mate messing with me and searched my room, the whole time the voice followed me, in my ear ""Hey, hey what're you doing? What's going on? What're you doing?"" I huffed and went to ask my house-mate who was in my room. the second I opened my bedroom door the voice stopped.

The next night I went to bed late. Even then I couldn't sleep thinking about my closet doors, the voice and Brian. When sleep finally came it was a bit after mid-night, but just as quickly I woke up. It was still dark and the house was quiet. Standing over me as I lay in bed looking right at me was an older gentleman. I vividly remember his short greying hair, he appeared to be about 6ft or a little shorter. He wore a black suit and tie. I caught my breath, closed and rubbed my eyes and he was gone.

The next night I don't remember. I went to bed and I woke up on the futon in the downstairs living room. When I asked one of the girls downstairs how I ended up sleeping on the futon she told me that I had come downstairs around 11:30, sheet white and say ""Can I sleep down here tonight? I can't sleep in my room, I just can't sleep there tonight. Can I please stay here?""

After that night Brian's activities calmed down. My closet doors would still open and close at night. If I was up late I would hear footsteps walking up and down the stairs. Lights would turn on seemingly at random, but nothing more. 

After two years all 5 of us moved out and passed the house on to some younger girls. When asked about Brian each has a story of something strange or unexplained happening to them. The girl who got my old room says the closets still open and close, but she hasn't heard or seen anything else.",nosleep,strangeeyes,/r/nosleep/comments/g4idl/brian/
70,"I would like to think I'm not crazy, but I keep seeing a person where he shouldn't be...",1300186767,"He hasn't spoken to me yet. That's a good sign, right?

Around five years ago I started seeing a tall, sickly man with long, greasy and unkempt hair obscuring his eyes. Not that big of a deal though, I mean I usually only saw him every few weeks, and occasionally two months went go by and he hadn't paid a visit. Plus what was wrong with it anyway? Maybe he just wanted to borrow a hairbrush but was too afraid to ask? Well, he peers out from behind bookcases where no human should actually fit, and sometimes twists himself around corners. At first I don't see him, but something makes me look up—ambient noise from the heater or something, right? But then I see his sallow flesh-and-bone fingers slide out around the wooden bookcase, or around the doorway or corner. And then he leans forward to peer around at me. Sometimes I see his face, well, what I can see of it under that mass of stringy, matted hair. 

Anyway, I hadn't seen him for about 8 months; I moved to a new place at around that time, and then went off to travel for a couple weeks, so I thought maybe I'd stop seeing him. And I did, for awhile. But today I walked into my bedroom and suddenly he was watching me from between my bed and the wall, i.e. a space in which a mouse would have difficulty fitting. In that split second while I froze upon seeing him, his face changed into the most foul grin I've ever seen, and I jumped back a little just in front the doorway. I don't think a smile has ever made me feel sick before, but I’m nauseated just thinking about it. And then I blinked and he was gone. 

So I took a deep breath and laughed at myself because it was probably my own shadow cast on the wall by the lamp, and I felt so ridiculous. But the folded blankets on my bed were a handspan to the left of where they should have been... But I must've moved them that morning to fetch an errant sock, right? Right. I took another deep breath and laughed again, because in my silly bout of fear I forgot the reason why I went into my bedroom anyway. I couldn’t remember, so I just turned around abruptly in the doorway so I could go back to writing papers, and when I turned I looked straight into his eyes. And his sick grin. I saw his eyes. And I never never never never *ever* want to see them again. But I managed to do something somewhat reasonable, I slammed the door, and tried to pretend none of this ever happened. I just have a migraine, right? A dreadfully bad migraine, and creepy guy is a just a symptom, right...? Yes, for sure. For sure.

By that moment I was already on the street running for my life when it began to fill with monsters and abominations.

72,Just stay still...,1300181077,"A little background. When I was a child I grew up in New England in one of the more historic towns that existed. The house was built in the late 1700's and clearly showed it's age and creepiness. Dirt cellar, giant attic with no light and of course it was also right next to a cemetery which meant most of my friends didn't sleep over. My mother has revealed to me, now that I am older, that throughout my entire youth I had intense night terrors, literally screaming bloody-murder, almost every week. I think I know why...

My room was about 8x10 with three doors. The wall my bed was against had a door leading directly to the attic( I would sit up at night and watch to see if it moved, I hated this door), the wall to the right was one of those two sliding door closets and next to it a door to the bathroom. The wall directly opposite was a door to the guest bedroom, and then my sisters room.

 When I was about 10 I awoke in the middle of the night to the closet door rattling. I rolled over so I was lying facing the closet, about four feet away, and knew this was the wrong move almost immediately. The door rattling got progressively worse and eventually they began to slam on their tracks as if the were being kicked from the inside, very violently. At this point my mother, who's bedroom was across the hall only about fifteen feet away got up and yelled from the hall to stop playing with my dog, cheeseburger. And to quite down before she went back to her bedroom.

I was frozen, I could not say a thing, I tried to tell her the dog was downstairs but could not get the words out. The doors were shaking so hard that I could see the bottoms lift out and off the floor about six inches. I knew If I made any noise or movement I was done, I would let whatever it was know I knew it was there, and my body told me that was the worst possible result. So I shut my eyes and sat there for what seemed like an eternity hoping to make it to the next morning. 

The closet doors became less and less violent in their movement and eventually stopped. It was a trick, I knew it. Every piece of my body and soul wanted to jump up and run out of that room, but I knew that is what it wanted. So I laid there under my covers until dawn came, and I was able to finally go. 

I never once had a good night's sleep in this house, and that is something I will never forget.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g4ag9/just_stay_still/
73,Come Home Now,1300179068,"When I’m tired they show up.  Well past dark, in the hours where midnight gives way to a static blackness.  They always show up.  I’ve just grown used to it now; it’s a fact.  I live with it the same way someone lives with water stains in their ceiling or palmetto bugs populating the shower stall after a late summer thunderstorm.  It’s just what happens when the otherlings conspire on the other end of my heavy eyelids.

I tried telling my mom about it once, but she said I had an overactive imagination, that those things weren’t real, that I drank too much Mountain Dew before bedtime.  And I tried telling my best friend one time but he just laughed and told me to stop fucking with him.  I told my cousin once and she gave the briefest of nods, a knowing glance, before changing the subject.  I knew she’d seen them too.  But that was two years ago, and nobody’s really seen here since.  Ran off with some guy to Singapore, they all say.  Or someplace like that.  

I don’t think she went to Singapore at all.

When they show up, the room gets cold and the static hum departs.  Silence.  I don’t know what they are, but they’re a collection of something that makes my blood run in reverse.  They’re more than shadow and less than man.  They form no distinct shape or form, and yet I see hands reaching out through the darkness, twisted fingers combing the air between my shallow exhalations and the corners they claim.  My breathy cadence, the carbon dioxide that calls the bedbugs, is the beacon that draws them from the closet, from the vents, from the dresser drawers that were closed in the daylight hours.  

As they collapse upon me, extremities of shadow, extensions of tangible darkness, the faintest of whispers breaks the silence and settles in my right ear.  The words are wet and wicked, as if something is licking my ear, inserting sound through stilted syllables and saliva.  COME HOME NOW, nothing with a mouth breezes past my cheek.  

COME HOME NOW.

I curl up and draw the blankets over my head, press my palms into the pillow and force it over my face, but even still, I can sometimes feel the sheets lifted.  I can feel the chill riding up the covers, settling in my lungs, as something bends my toes.  I’m transported from the bed entirely.  It disappears.  I’m nowhere, floating in darkness.  Conscious and worse off for it.  There is nothing to see or hear or smell, but all the world’s pain enters my chest and I feel everything awful all at once.  A man stabbed in a subway station.  A woman dragged off a jogging path and raped.  A mother finding her only child face down in the backyard pool.  They fill me all at once until my eyes bulge and my jaw unhinges to allow a scream, some release from the madness, but there is no air here and I can do nothing but float with the summation of the world’s wickedness.

That’s where they want to take me.  I know.  Eventually, they will.  Just like I think they took my cousin.  And in the end it won’t be the angry eyes that get me, the ghoul drifting through the drywall, but rather the constant explosions down my spine as I’m forced to live everyone’s worst nightmares, leeching off their horror, a parasite draining the world of its collective horrors.  I know that is where I will end up one day, and to whatever extent I can, I accept that.  I still don’t sleep much and I still cling to the corners of my comforter trying to stay in this world, but I will end up in theirs, eventually.  

I just wonder – and this is the one thing I can’t accept – why they tell me it’s home.  COME HOME NOW, they say, they’ve always said.  But why?  Why is the darkness home?  Am I one of them?  An otherling?  From which nothingness did I originate?  These are the questions I struggle with as I cling to this world.  

Tonight, though, a banging at the door interrupts the still, and the reach of darkness retreats, rolling back under the doors and in the vents and cabinets and drawers.  A pillar of light burns through the window, illuminating a cyclone of dust.  I notice, for the first time, that the comforter smells different than usual.  Wet and salty, a hint of copper hanging in the air.  It’s patterned with worn flowers and stained red in spots and I realize with a start that it’s not my bed at all.  Has it ever been my bed?

The door finally departs from its hinges and a man stands in the dim portal revealed.  Something about him sets my teeth on edge, grows vampire fangs over false teeth.  Everything he says is emphatic, but seems muted to me.  I only see him, but can feel the darkness lingering, creeping its way back through the cracks, seeking me.  And as the fingers grip my hair and part my toes and begin to pull me into the Great Nothing, as my lungs fill with ice, all I can think about is that wonderful metallic scent swimming in my sinuses and how it makes me feel whole, unfractured as I’m dragged off and made to vanish.  

In that nothing, I can taste his pain through the meat-ripping spikes that have replaced my incisors.  It tastes wonderful.  I’m finally home now, I realize, consuming all his memories.  They’ll say Singapore, but we know the truth.  I’m in the darkness now.  I am the darkness.  Soon to be hungry again, waiting to wake to that iron-heavy smell that sets man back a few billion years on the evolutionary scale and the consequential desire to consume lives entire.",nosleep,Reptarftw,/r/nosleep/comments/g4a1f/come_home_now/

75,Never Talk To Strangers ,1300174735,"On pleasant days while I was attending college I would walk to classes from my dumpy little apartment about a mile away from campus. There were several routes I would take, but my favorite was a small paved path through a park that followed the river. This park was very nice, it had benches every few hundred feet facing the water and so many trees that you couldn't even see that the busiest street in town was only a few hundred yards away. This path was out of the way so the only real traffic on it in the middle of the day was the occasional jogger or bicyclist. 

I used this path maybe two or three times a month, and every time on the same bench there would be this little old man in a nice suit facing the water just staring down at the shore. He seemed to be in his mid to late 80s and I just assumed he came there everyday because he had nothing else to occupy his time. I felt sorry for him, he seemed so lonely just sitting on that bench all alone all day. I decided that I would be a good person and sit down and talk with him, I thought maybe the old man came there everyday hoping someone would sit down next to him and talk. 

One a very nice day at the beginning of spring I was walking down the path and saw the old man sitting on the bench. I walked up to the bench and sat down next to him and said hello. The old man didn't look up from the river he kept his eyes right on the spot he had always been staring at. I said hello a little louder, thinking he may not of heard me the first time. 

This time he replies ""Oh I'm sorry I didn't see you there, I was busy watching the boys play down in the water."" I was very thrown off by this, I thought this poor old man must have Alzheimer's and comes here everyday reliving his past. I ask him if they are his sons, he frowns and says ""no, but it's my responsibility to watch them."" I didn't want to play along with his delusions too much, but he obviously cared a lot about these imaginary boys so I asked him why it was his responsibility. He gets a very sullen look on his face almost as if he was going to cry at any moment and he says in a voice I can barely hear over the moving water ""I threw them in there and I need to be damn sure none of them ever try to get back out."" I promptly said goodbye walked away and never used the river path again.  ",nosleep,moveoverem,/r/nosleep/comments/g493x/never_talk_to_strangers/
76,Long story of a not so scary encounter from when I was young.,1300173580,"This isn't really a scary story or anything, but I just wanted to share my experience with a ghost from when I was younger. I was about nine or so when I first saw it. I was playing on the computer which we had set up in the kitchen. Behind me was the table where we would eat, and behind me to my right was the counter, stove, and fridge. I think while the screen was loading another page or something, I saw a reflection of a figure standing behind me in between the counter and the table. It looked like a little girl with hair to her shoulders, and she was just standing there watching me.

When I turned around, there was no one there, and when I turned back to the PC, I didn't see the reflection I had first seen. I sat there for a moment, wondering what had I just saw. Was it my imagination, or was I really seeing another person?

Well, it didn't take too long after that I started feeling followed just about anywhere I went. I never felt afraid of it's presence, I was more curious, and wanting to be friends with it really. The only time I'd feel afraid of a presence, was when I'd be in our basement. Most of the time I'd feel a very strong presence around me, and whenever I'd go up the stairs, I'd either run up, or go up backwards to watch behind me. Whatever/whoever was in my basement, I was a bit afraid of it. But other than that, I never really had any experiences in that basement.

But back to the little girl that follows me everywhere. This went on for a while, I can't be certain of how long, it could have been weeks, months, or even years. After thinking I saw her one day in the reflection of the mirror windows of my school while outside during recess, when no one else was around, I decided to ask my mom about her. Now, you see, my mom is a psychic. And she didn't really know if she was following me or not the time I asked her. But when when I talked to her again about the girl, she told me that the girl was following me around, but she didn't know why.

I know some of you may not believe in psychics, and neither did I for a while. I only half believed the stories my mom would tell me about her past, and the things she saw for peoples futures. But recently, about a few months ago, after all these years, I finally asked her to tell me about my future. Now, she didn't really tell me too much, because all of these years she's been blocking me out because she wants me to have privacy. But, somehow we got on the topic of a few of my friends, and she told me things from their pasts that I, nor my friends have ever told her. She even told me a few things that I didn't know, but suspected about some of my friends. So, you may not believe her, but I do now.

Anyways, I've gone off track with the story. Some unknown amount of time later, I was again in the kitchen, this time heating food in the microwave. While watching the food spin, I saw the reflection of a small shadowy figure run from the hallway, which is just left of the computer, down past the table, and towards the side-door/stairs to the basement. I don't know why she would have been running, but it kind of startled me that time because of the fact she was running. If she was running, what was she running from? And now while I'm writing this, I now realize something. My room was straight down the hallway where she could have been running from.

Little history of the house by the way. It was built by my dads parents years before, and the only person to have died in the house was his mother. My guess to why there were spirits in the house in the first place, must have been because my mom had been practicing with them a lot when I was younger, and so we got a lot of visits. And we still do in our new house, but not as much. And I don't feel the presence of anyone around me as much lately unless I am completely in a calm state like now. I do feel as of right now, that someone may be in my room with me, but it's hard for me to tell.

Thank you all for reading, sorry it's not scary or anything like that, but it's my experience with the paranormal, and I thought I'd share since I love reading all the posts here on /r/nosleep. If you have any questions about my story, or maybe want to know some other experiences I had, or even maybe a story from my moms past, let me know. I told her recently about /r/nosleep, and she told me that you probably wouldn't want to read about her stories because of the bad things that have happened. So maybe I should see about having her write up one of her stories?",nosleep,Niceguy12834,/r/nosleep/comments/g48ub/long_story_of_a_not_so_scary_encounter_from_when/
77,Persistent Visitor,1300172840,"Next Thursday will be the three year anniversary of the day I moved out of my last house.  Until this moment I've never shared my true reasoning for my sudden departure, but it's time to bare the load off my chest.

I live in a medium sized southern town.  While it has certainly grown throughout the 19 years I've been here, it's never really lost the small town feeling that drew my family and I here in the first place.  My childhood was spent with a small circle of friends that lasted throughout grade school and became the reason I stayed and went to the local college while my family moved away.  I graduated and go a job at the local theatre and began looking for my first house.

I looked at a house in the historic district and fell immediately in love.  It was a beautiful two story brick home that dated back to the end of the civil war.  It needed a lot of work but I offered to do all the remodeling for a lower rent.  I ended up getting it for a steal and moved in two days after graduation.  

Four months went by without incident.  I got a dog to keep me company and all of a sudden a beautiful girl popped into my life as well.  Everything was perfect.

It was October when I began work on the basement.  I was looking forward to it as remodeling the basement would open up the room for a pool table I had been eying.  My friend Tim came up to spend the winter with me and give me a hand.

The first day of work we tore down a dividing wall and began the difficult work of preparing the walls for insulation, drywall and the whole deal.  We worked well into the evening and finally stopped for the day to grab dinner with my girlfriend and get a well deserved beer.

Many beers later we came back to the house and I set Tim up in the guest room and went to bed myself.  Sometime during the night I woke up to a knock on my door and assuming it was Tim, turned on the light and told him to come in.  The knocking stopped and I heard footsteps walk away towards the guest room. 

Thinking he hadn't heard me I got up and opened the door to catch him to find the hallway empty and quiet except for the sound of Tim snoring.  Deciding I dreamt it I went back to bed and forgot the incident.  The next day we continued work and all was quiet.

A few weeks later I woke up to the knocking again, this time it was urgent and continued till I grabbed the doorknob.  Upon opening the door only the empty hallway stared back.  Suddenly I heard footsteps going down the stairs and I gave chase thinking Tim was simply up to shenanigans.  Once I discovered the stairwell to be empty, I walked back up to the guest roomed and heard, once again, Tims light snoring.  I was a bit freaked but decided to ignore it like the last time and go to bed.  Once again things quieted down.

Feburary came and began with Tims departure and my girlfriend and I breaking up.  Needless to say that week was drowned out mostly in booze.  It was the fourth night of my bender when the knocking happened again.  In my stupor I ignored it for a short while before screaming at it to stop.  At the sound of my voice the door began vibrating from the intense pounding on the other side.  I turned on the light and throw the door open only for the knob to be wrenched from my hand as the door slammed shut right back in my face.  

At this the house went silent.  A few short moments later I heard the footsteps on the stairs going back down.  No longer possessed with drunken courage I went back beneath my covers in a cold sweat to wait out the night.

This became a ritual.  Every night the knocking would wake me up and not cease till I either tried to force the door open and leave, or morning came.  For two weeks I dealt with it it, even buying earplugs to sleep in.  I was getting no work done in the house and my work was starting to fail noticeably at the theatre.  At the end of the second week I suddenly had a full nights sleep.  I assumed things were over.  I assumed wrong.

A week to the day from my beautiful nights sleep, the knocking returned.  This time it was softer, and only lasted long enough to wake me.  At first i wasn't even sure I had heard it until the door to my bedroom opened.  I stared into the darkness beyond the door and froze.  I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.  There wasn't a sound except for my heartbeat.  I laid there for a little over an hour, staring.  Slowly, my door began to close.  As it clicked shut, the same footsteps I had heard on my stairs began walking towards me.  Still paralyzed, all I could do was wait as they reached the edge of my bed.  

Tears formed at my eyes as I felt pressure against my chest.  It became heavier and heavier until I could no longer take a breath.  Suddenly my mind snapped out of it and I began thrashing but nothing I did would take the pressure off my chest.  Amidst my twisting I hit my lamp, toppling it over and sending it crashing to the floor.  As the lamp hit the pressure lifted.  I ran from my room, stopping only long enough to put on my shoes before leaving the house.  I ran down the sidewalk and kept running.  I didn't ease the thought of something chasing me till I reached the downtown area and the theatre where I worked.  I unlocked the door and ran to my office where I stayed till morning.

After this I called my landlord to break my lease and went back to the house only after I had found a suitable apartment and could begin packing.  I told my landlord it was money problems.  I told my family it was because I wanted less space.  I lied to everyone.  I stayed one more week at the house while packing.  I slept only in chunks during the day and spent my nights out with friends or sitting in my living room with every light on.  The day I moved was the greatest day of my life and I still avoid even driving by my old neighborhood.

I have since moved into a new fix-me-up and have had no problems.  Though it's hard to explain to my finance why I still sleep with ear plugs.",nosleep,CulturalRemedy,/r/nosleep/comments/g48nr/persistent_visitor/
78,Mama's Gonna Buy You A Mockingbird,1300169154,"It was a long and unusually warm spring-turning-into-summer; endlessly balmy evenings that faded into pale dawn, never really touching darkness, butter-yellow crescent moons hanging low in the pink-blue nighttime sky over the beach, gentle breezes stirring the pine trees, and blowing soft licks of sand up and into the whispering dunes of sea grass bordering the golf fairways. Our sophomore year was drawing towards its close, exams were over, and we were all trying to eke out what remaining time there was in our small college town, aware that summer would come all too soon, breaking the delicate magic that hung over the fast-vanishing weeks between the end of exams and summer vacation.


And so it was a time for the crazy behaviour that can never be planned; drinking till dawn, catching a cab out to the end of the beach, sitting in the dunes on the still-warm sand, carefree groups round makeshift fires, a sparkling chemistry of youth and freedom and privilege, stumbling home arm-in-arm along the beach side, startling the early golfers with the sudden squalling rabble of our merriment. And so it went on, the never-dark nights making people drunk in a way that alcohol never could, shimmering and shifting in the half-light, shadows flitting through the soft blue-smoke-grey light of nights spent up too late, days spent in fitful semi slumber, dozing off the long nights of a youth we thought could never end. 


And so it was that night - I can't pin it down more precisely - that night, after that day, after another night the same, that we came to be sitting loosely clustered on the stair-top porch of my and Stevie's apartment, the upper floor of a respectably stolid Victorian grey granite house. Gone three in the morning, the heat radiating out of the stippled stone of the walls, the still air moistly warm - too warm to be inside, and us too sober to go to bed, but too drunk to want to sleep, a half-full moon waxing fat overhead. Stevie was a little drunker that the rest of us, singing gentle happy songs half to himself, half to us, holding us in thrall with the tousle-headed charm of the effortlessly beautiful, making up new words to childhood songs, narrating the evening's events in verse to the tune of ""Mama's Gonna Buy You A Mockingbird"". The scent of the night was almost overpowering, a rich loam, dank with the sudden unleashing of months of burgeoning fertility, edged around with the sex-bitter tang of flowering pear and powerful sweetness of honeysuckle, rushing up at us all at once from the garden below.


Even before that summer I found the heavy scent of honeysuckle unsettling, a cloying near-funereal pall that hung in pockets in summer air, masking all other scents, seeming almost to wrap itself around and inside my nostrils with its potent perfume, inveigling its way past everything else. And there, that evening, quite suddenly, it was overpowering. Stevie's singing trailed suddenly to silence and at that moment the muffled dun of the town hall clock marking the half hour. The silence went on - a little too long, a little too tense, the spell broken by a sudden crash from inside the apartment. Stevie pulled an irritated grimace and muttered ""stupid windows, banging every night"" and looked over to me. ""Go and open it up again would you? It'll be my bedroom. The wood must shrink in the frame with the temperature change, but the stupid thing bangs shut almost every night, and I can never get it to stick open. You give it a try."" I grinned at his irritation, and got up to push the door open, grabbing the hand of my girlfriend Kate as I stood. 


The hallway was dead silent and surprisingly cool, the thick stone walls serving their purpose well. With no lights on and the rest of the apartment in darkness, its twenty foot length was suffused with a soft grey, tendrils of watery darkness lapping their way into corners, and pooling by the skirting boards, disappearing into the faceless black of a heavily theatrical carved mirror on the wall beyond the bedroom door. I gave an involuntary shiver and laughed sharply, trying to throw off the slight spooking the sudden change in temperature and atmosphere had brought upon me. Kate poked me playfully in the ribs and whispered ""come on… there's a bottle of gin somewhere in the kitchen, find that and the tonic, and I'll deal with the window"". We walked down the hallway together, me aiming for the far end where the sitting room door stood a fraction ajar leading through and to the kitchen beyond, while Kate disappeared off to the right to the first of the two bedrooms. I would swear now that as I passed by that mirror, I saw something flicker past the corner of the frame, a shadow slipping through the narrow gap of the door frame beyond it as I walked towards it, pushing the door sharply open.


The stench now of honeysuckle was almost overpowering, mingling grotesquely with the stale smell of kitchen scraps and dirty dishes, a sour reminder that morning followed night, and there would be tidying up to do. I looked around the darkened room, taking a moment to catch my bearings, noticing that the power must have been off at some time during the day - no unusual occurrence in the summer. The wood of the floor was illuminated by the blinking green pulse of the DVD player's clock, the LEDs casting a small pool of green that was reflected by the white of the walls. It took me a moment to realise; 00:01 - the power could only just have gone off, and only for a split second. I groped on the wall for the main light switch, and it clicked to nothing, as I noticed the heavy  silence. Looking through the arched opening to the kitchen, I could see the same: a cooker clock ticking silently at 00:01, the microwave above answering with its own steady blink. The fridge, which would normally pervade the flat with a gentle hum, was silent. I looked around the room again, suddenly spooked once more, and, to break the heavy quiet, shouted through to Kate ""The gin? Where is it? Kitchen?"" Silence. I could hear blood surge in my ears as my heart pumped. I held my breath, waiting for her response. Silence. A flicker from by the door caught the corner of my eye, and I whipped my head suddenly, but knew as soon as I moved that there was nothing there. I forced a laugh and called brightly ""Never mind, I've got it, it'll be in the fridge"" moving quickly towards the kitchen, only to jump back as a cloud of thickly buzzing flies lifted from the dishes in the sink. The sickly-sour smell of turned milk wafted up at me, making me catch my breath. 


This time, I knew I wasn't imagining anything. As I'd stepped back from the sink, I had turned to face the archway and was now looking back into the sitting room, the DVD player obscured by the sofa, but the pulsing blink still visible on the walls. And there, on the wall above the fireplace, another mirror; this one more modern, a smooth silvered frame. And there was no mistaking the movement this time; something darker, blacker moved in the reflection, a sharp dart to the left, and then fast down the wall. The fridge shuddered as the pump kicked loudly into action breaking the silence, and with a sudden rush of brightness, the sitting room light washed the room in light, and through the kitchen window I caught a Stevie's voice as he sang to himself, the original words this time, and sweetly beautiful. ""Hush little baby, don't say a word, papa's gonna buy you a mocking bird"" as I suddenly realised I had been holding my breath. I laughed gently, chiding myself for getting spooked, and realising that I'd probably been awake slightly too long, and had a couple of drinks too many. Nevertheless, I opened the now lively fridge, grabbed the bottle of Gordon's and some Schweppes tonic, rummaging without success in the salad box for a lime. I clutched the bottles and walked sharply out of the kitchen, clattering my feet across the wooden boards, a faint heat of embarrassment rising in me for my earlier cowardly behaviour. And stopped. The DVD player's light held steady, 03:44, ticking over as I heard the faint toll of the bell again, marking the quarter hour. And then Kate, singing the same song Stevie had been singing through the window, her softly muffled voice drifting down the hall. ""If that mocking bird don't sing, Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring."" I smiled and pushed the door to Stevie's bedroom open. 


She was badly cut. Very badly. Up her arms, a jagged rip snaking across her collar bone, eyes staring blankly ahead, like something mechanical. For several seconds, I couldn't compute her face, and then realised the deep gash across her mouth had slashed a rictus, showing too many teeth. Too many teeth. Blood on her face, on her arms, pooling on her light summer dress, the jagged piece of broken mirror cutting into her hand as she slashed at her arm gasping as she sang on ""If that diamond ring turns to brass, mama's going to buy you a looking glass"". Blood on her neck, blood streaking across the twisted honeysuckle flowers that garlanded her neck, the woody stems pressing hard into her flesh, the pale pink blossoms turned a livid red. Her singing stopped and her head tuned towards me, eyes white, rolled back into her head. She gave a gasp and a groan, that turned into a sharp keening wail, growing in volume, growing, and building to a full throated hysterical screaming, an animal cry of rage and fear and god knows what else. As suddenly as it had built, she stopped, crumpling into a pile like a rag doll, whimpering quietly, the shard of broken mirror falling to the floor by her leg. I ran to her, trying to lift her, failing, trying again, and finally bundled her into my arms, the blood slick against my skin, my hands slipping. Half carrying, half dragging, I pulled her from the room. The scent of honeysuckle was overpowering, mingled with the iron-sharp tang of blood; down the hall, desperately aiming for the closed door to the porch. Passing the living room, the singing started again; ""If that looking glass gets broke, mama's gonna…"" and an enormous crash as the mirror above the fireplace shattered to the floor. 


I don't really remember how we made it through the door; Stevie is somewhat blank about it too. One minute I was banging at the inside of the door, scratching frantically at the paint work, desperately hugging Kate to me, aware of the singing getting stronger and louder, and the next… well. It's just not clear, that part. Stevie was already on the his cellphone to the ambulance people, and the eerie flash of the blue light  was strobing across the sky. And in the distance, the town bell struck five. ",nosleep,tangled,/r/nosleep/comments/g47px/mamas_gonna_buy_you_a_mockingbird/
79,One time while on the phone late at night...,1300155324,"I'll never forget this one night.  I had a crush that lived on the other side of the US. We would spend long nights on the phone as crushes do. Sometimes falling asleep while talking, sometimes mumbling incoherently to each other late into the night.

One particular night I laid in bed on my side with the cell phone under my ear between me and the pillow. We had dropped off silently as on other occasions.

Suddenly I was jolted awake by a very loud baby scream. It was like it had happened in the room with me. My heart was racing. I realized the noise had been in my head.

80,Memory of another sleepless night,1300153943,"Reading through a few of these today reminded me of another terrifying experience.

I was about 16 and still living at my parent's house. My entire family was overseas at the time and just a couple of months beforehand my grandfather had passed away. My immediate family and grandparents were always close and they would often stay at our house.

This particular house had a fairly long hallway (100ft or so) and slate flooring. My bedroom door was directly at the end of the hallway. I was laying there very nearly asleep when from the other end of the hallway I hear foot steps. It didn't sound like someone trying to creep through the house, it was the distinct sound of my grandfather's walk. The heel of his slippers dragging across the uneven joins in the slate. The unsteady footsteps as he dealt with the discomfort of his knees and back. You get to know exactly who is walking around just by listening to their feet and I definitely recognised this person in an instant.

My initial reaction was elation. For the first fraction of a second I was excited to hear that he finally came home, then reality set in and I remembered why that wasn't possible. Denial can be cruel.

These hobbling footsteps continued at a leisurely pace down the hallway for what felt like an eternity. They kept getting closer and closer to my open door and with each step my heart rate increased. By the time they were half way to my room I was sitting upright in bed, barely breathing as I tried to comprehend what was going on.

The steps continued. Past the spare room, past the bathroom, past my sister's room and eventually all the way to my doorway. Against every instinct I stayed put, wide eyed and staring at the doorway waiting to see someone. The footsteps went all the way to the end where this person should have been in plain sight but still I saw nothing. I hear two more steps, one long drag on my carpet and a short, abrupt one; the sound of someone coming to a halt just inside my room.

Adrenaline still pumping, my heart feels like its about to explode when all of a sudden I'm overcome with a sense of calm. The fear gives way to contentment and I feel like everything is ok.

I was not asleep and this was no messed up dream. I don't believe in ghosts or the supernatural but for the life of me I cannot explain what happened. The part of me that misses him so dearly wants to believe he came to say good bye.

82,Has anyone else ever had an ACTUAL deja-vu experience? ,1300150549,"In January, I had this very vivid dream of me standing in Penn station loading my metro card with money my mother had given me, and I remember thinking it was way too much and her saying ""well you'll use it so put it all on"". I remember the metro card machine not working, and there being a line of people behind me, and looking over to see if my mom and siblings (who were standing with luggage) were okay, and I saw my mom trying to help this girl with directions, which I thought was insane because she is unfamiliar with the area.

This was all a dream, and I woke up and was like ""wtf? I'd never take my family to NYC. That's crazy.""

Fast forward three months. I had completely forgotten about this dream. Out of the blue, my mom asks me to take her and the kids to NYC. I had still forgotten about the dream..until I was standing in Penn station...putting $20 on my metro card, when the machine started to not work...looked over to check on mom, saw her giving directions....yeah. It was weird. And I specifically remembered having vividly dreamed that. 

I admit, maybe some unconscious thought was at work when I helped plan the trip, but I had honestly forgotten all about that dream until I remembered it happening while I refilled the metrocard.

85,It seems the creepiest stuff always happens when you should be asleep.,1300138370,"Let me preface this by saying outright that this is not a creepypasta, nor does it really have a defintive answer or twist at the end. This is just a retelling of what happened to me last night as I lay in bed trying to catch some sleep.

I live in a college town, on the bottom floor of a small duplex that is divided into two one bedroom apartments with my fiancee and my black lab, Stella. The duplex itself is right behind my landlord's ""football season"" house, maybe six feet from his back porch. All of the windows in my apartment are on the wall facing his back door. Our upstairs neighbor lives by himself and is kind of a loner, and our landlord's daughter stays in the house while school is in session. Other than those two, the apartment is pretty secluded. The house sits at the end of a long driveway, and we behind it, walled in on three sides by a thicket of trees.

Anyway, we all drove down to her family's house in a town a few hours south Friday night and stayed there until last night. I managed to somehow sleep most of the day away on Sunday, waking up around 3:30. We finally pulled back into our driveway around 10:30, and I noticed that both our landlord's daughter and upstairs neighbor's cars were gone, and all of the lights we shut off in both people's places.

When we walked into the house, it felt a little...off. Stella must have noticed it, too, because she slowly crept in behind us with her tail tucked between her legs and her ears perked up the way labs do when something piques their interest. We never have the AC on, no matter if we're home or away (especially not when we're away) but the apartment was cold - colder than it was outside - which is strange for spring in Mississippi. 

But what was weirder was the smell. There was a pretty strong stink coming from the tiny hallway that we call a kitchen. We looked and looked for what could be causing it, but we just couldn't find anything. I, perhaps frustrated by the inconclusive search, grabbed up our trash can and proclaimed it to be the source of the smell, and promptly put it outside. My fiancee, unconvinced, just rolled her eyes and went to bed.

Since I had been asleep for most of the day, I knew I wasn't going to sleep very well, and decided not to even try since I had to be up and ready for work by 5 AM. At around 2 AM, I decided to take Stella for a walk. On the way back down the driveway, I noticed again that our two neighbors still weren't home.

When I went back inside, it felt the same way that it had when we first made it back - really cold and just kind of... strange. I can't exactly explain it. But I noticed the stink more than ever. It smelled like someone had been boiling mayonnaise. It was really overbearing, so I decided to air out the apartment by opening all three windows before getting in bed to check reddit.

Stella got in her bed and fell almost immediately asleep, and my fiancee was long since out. I was laughing at some dumb f7u12 comic when all of a sudden Stella jumps straight up off of her bed and starts growling. Not a loud growl, mind you, but a low kind of throaty growl, like she was unsure of what was going on. But the look in her eye didn't make it seem like she was confused. She seemed scared. And she was staring directly at my bedroom window...the window not two inches from my bed.

Startled by this, I couldn't take my eyes off of her. The hairs between her shoulder blades were beginning to stand straight up and that low throaty growl was getting a lot less low and a lot more angry. She started puffing, which is what I call it when she starts to bark but doesn't quite get it out. Just a kind of ""Wff...Uff..."" kind of sound. She starts puffing more and more and slinking towards the window and growling louder and louder.

I start to say ""What is it, Stella?"" and try and calm her down, but as soon as I speak I hear a loud rustling coming from the bushes right under my bedroom window, followed shortly by some loud thudding footsteps running up the wooden steps of my landlord's back porch. Then I heard their back door open and quickly slam shut. 

And the damnedest thing about it was, as soon as the door slammed shut, Stella calmed down and went right back to sleep. And a few seconds after that, I fell asleep too.

87,"Something old, something new...",1300133088,"
My wife and I have just had our first child together, beautiful baby boy.  For those of you that know that with kids come expenses, strollers, car seats, cribs and other knickknack’s. 

My wife is a very frugal shopper, if we can find something on craigslist/goodwill/salvation army we buy it there.  Why pay for new when is going to outgrow it in a few months anyways...

One of the things we picked up was a front facing mirror (Something like [this](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?sku=14844961&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=shopping)).  It basically allows you to see the baby while you driving if something should come up.

For any of you that have ever driven with one, it is sort of disorienting, because everything you see in the mirror is reversed, since you are looking at a mirror in a mirror.

I finally put it in the car and seems to work pretty good, it was not until the last few nights that I have had to work late that things started to get a little odd.

Friday night was the first time I noticed it.  I was driving home (we were doing an ISP switch so we had to do it after hours).  It was about 11:30 PM or so and I was driving home, just called my wife to see how she and my son where doing, got off the phone and got a strange feeling that someone was sitting behind me, so my first instinct is to look in the rear view mirror.  In the baby mirror I see a figure sitting there leaning over towards where the car seat would be (the car seat was not in the car, just the base).  

So I panic, not in a way that made me serve, but just the increase heartbeat, lump in the throat, not knowing what is going on feeling and turn around and look behind and nothing, so I glance back up in the mirror and nothing.

It was one of the oddest sensations I think I have felt.  Over the weekend I have seen this figure 2 separate times and my wife has seen it as well.

I have been doing some research on hope spirits can attach themselves to objects and items and it frightens my wife to know that something like that is possible.

We have removed the mirror for now.",nosleep,Monyshot,/r/nosleep/comments/g3w3x/something_old_something_new/
88,"""He wears a red and white lettered sweater and smokes out of a corncob pipe, right?""",1300128411,"When I was 5, I lived in a small two bedroom house with my parents and my uncle and aunt. My uncle and aunt didn't have any children, and they lived in the bedroom towards the back of the house. My parents and I lived in the bedroom located in the front of the house. 

I don't have too many memories of this place. The ones that I do remember are short, strange, and dreamlike. I remember my fifth birthday and my Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cake. I remember taking long hot baths and playing with action figures in the tub until both my toes and fingers were wrinkled. 

I also have a couple memories of waking up early at dawn, after my father had left for work, and seeing an older white man slowly walking around our bedroom, smoking out of pipe.

That last memory is always one that I blocked out of my memory for a long time. As I got older, I wrote them off as figments of an overactive childhood imagination, but... how could I make up something like that? 

I remember explaining the apparition to my mother a few times as I got ready for kindergarten. I'd tell her that a man had been in our room that morning, while she slept, and she'd laugh nervously and demand that I stop making up stories. Feeling frustrated and angry that my mother wouldn't believe me, I stopped reporting these sightings to anybody.

But it was true. I remember waking up a few times and looking out from under my covers and seeing an old white man in black slacks, a red-and-white lettered sweater, walking around the bedroom, smoking out of corncob pipe. I remember his face clearly; his deep wrinkles, big nose, bright blue eyes, and he always wore an expression of wonderment and concern. He'd walk around the room, right up next to my mother's sleeping body, peer down at her and then stare up at the ceiling, looking lost and confused. He never once acknowledged me. I'm not sure if he ever saw me. 

I never felt any fear or discomfort. I just remember feeling confused. I tried to shout out at my mother when this man was in the room, but I remember that I couldn't talk. I'd become frustrated, and then pull the covers over my face and fall asleep once more. A couple times, I'd stay awake and watch as he would just waltz around the room for about half an hour, and then watch him disappear into the closet. I'd then get up, walk up to the closet door, and yank it open. He'd never be there. 

We moved out of that house before my 6th birthday. I quickly forgot about this old white man at our old place as I got busy making new friends at a new school and enjoying first grade. Over time, I stopped thinking about these memories and after a few years, they had been repressed to the back of my mind.

Suddenly, I was 12. My aunt and uncle, still living at this same house, finally had their first child. The room where my parents and I lived in just a few years earlier became the nursery room, and that's where my new little cousin slept.

When my cousin turned 3, he began complaining to his mother that an old white man would wake him up in the early hours of the morning and not let him go back to sleep. Concerned, my aunt confided in my mother, believing that my little cousin was acting out for attention. My mother, alarmed at what my 3 year old cousin was reporting, told my aunt that I used to tell her the same story when I was younger.

At the behest of my aunt, my uncle began to research the history of the house.

As it turns out, in the mid 1940s, towards the end of WWII, an old couple had lived in that house. They had only one child, a young man who had gone off to war in the Pacific. According to old police reports and public records, the young man died in battle a couple of months before the war was over. His father had been a WWI veteran, and he had tried to talk his son out of going to war unsuccessfully. Upon hearing the sad tragic death of their only son, the wife blamed the father for their son's death. The man then began to drink heavily, and one morning, a year after their son's death, the wife found her husband dead, hanging in the closet of that front bedroom.

Alarmed by this history, my uncle and aunt had a priest come in and bless the entire house. And the apparitions stopped. Years passed, and they moved out.

A couple years ago, I found myself driving by that street and I decided to stop and reminisce. I parked my car out front and walked out onto the lawn, looking at the house, my head flooding with memories. 

A girl of about 12 years old came out of the house.

""Can I help you?"" She asked.

""No. I used to live here about 20 years ago. I was just driving by and decided to stop and take a look at the place.""

The girl approached me with a solemn look on her face.

""Which bedroom did you sleep in?"" She asked.

I pointed at the front windows, where the first bedroom was located.

""That's my room too!"" She exclaimed. ""Did you ever see him?""

I smiled.

""He wears a red and white letter sweater and smokes out of corncob pipe, right?"" I asked.

She nodded.

""Don't worry. He's harmless.""

She nodded.

""Harmless, but creepy.""",nosleep,illmindedjunkie,/r/nosleep/comments/g3ub2/he_wears_a_red_and_white_lettered_sweater_and/
89,Personal experiences I am unable to explain,1300127416,"I want to preface all this first: I'm not religious, and I firmly believe in science, and the natural world being explained through it.  I'm not trying to offer these up as ""proof"" of ghosts, or spirits, or whatever you want to call them.  These are my personal experiences and I just really feel the need to share.

The experiences started when I was about 13 years old.  My mother had given me a Ouija board as a present.  She told me tales of how she had one as a kid and the fun they had with it (surprising considering she comes from a very religious family - to this day I'm still stunned that they played with a Ouija board), so I was excited to give it a try with my friends.

I don't remember many of the answers it gave, but the best one by far was when we asked the Ouija board, ""Which of us is the smartest?""  It spelled out R-O-V-E-R, and we all had a laugh since my dog was laying on the floor next to us.

Shortly after using the Ouija board, strange things started happening.

One night, I was laying in bed, and I hear soft footsteps walking through the downstairs of the house.  Slow.  Deliberate.  And all the while getting closer to my room.  I freak out thinking there is a thief in the house, so I jump out of bed, turn on the lights, and run upstairs to wake my father up.  We look through the house, and there is nobody else in the house, nor is there any evidence of an open/broken window or door (they were all locked).  My father dismisses me as being tired or imagining things, and he goes back to sleep.  I climb back in bed, pretty convinced that I'm just hearing things too.

Just a few minutes after turning off the lights, I hear the footsteps.  Again.  Slow, soft, and deliberate.  Moving towards my room.

(Sorry, I need to pause here for a second.   Typing this story out and reliving it in my head is sending way too many shivers down my spine and the goosebumps will not go away.)

Needless to say, I flew out of bed and had every single light on downstairs, searching for whomever was walking around downstairs.  There was nobody there.  I did not sleep for the rest of the night.

Mind you, I grew up in a very rural setting.  It gets incredibly quiet at nighttime at my folks' place.  The footsteps I heard were very distinct - an adult-sized person trying to walk quietly on carpet...just the slow movement of one foot after another, and a bit of a rustle on the carpet.

I only heard the footsteps one other time...but I'll get to that story in a bit.

A couple of months after the footsteps, I had another incident I can't explain.  I had a couple of the old Tiger Electronics handheld games as a kid (you may remember [these](http://www.gamernoize.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AB.jpg)), and they were stored in my room along with a few other old toys in a box.  One night, in the middle of the night, I am awakened by the sound of one of the games that has turned on and suddenly starts playing.  I found it and I figured that something in the box must've shifted and somehow hit the power button.  I pick it up, shut it off, and put it on my dresser.  No biggie.

Less than a week later, the same thing happens...another game just suddenly turns on in the middle of the night, seemingly on its own.  I try to rationalize it by saying that when I took the 1st game out of the box, I must have shifted things enough so the second one went off due to items shifting around a week later.  Except...

...I had a little device that made various sound effects at the push of a button.  Just a funny, little novelty item.  Just a couple of weeks after the handheld games turn on all by themselves, I had an interesting phenomenon occur.  I had been petting my cat, and the cat was walking away.  The cat is passing by the sound effect machine on the shelf, probably about 2 feet away from it when it suddenly goes off on its own.  I was watching it the whole time, the cat did not touch it - it went off all on its own.

Coincidences?  Maybe.  But the timeframe of all these was just too strange.

Anyway, I'll get back to the footsteps thing again.  This one was by far the creepiest/most bizarre thing that happened.  Months after I heard the footsteps, I heard them again one night.  Same as before.  Slow and deliberate, creeping ever closer to my bedroom.  This time I waited.  The footsteps kept getting closer and closer.  I hear them right outside my door.  Then the door opens about halfway, seemingly on its own.  I hear the footsteps in my room now, and I am absolutely terrified.  I hide beneath my covers.  Then whatever was in the room actually got up on my bed.  I had a waterbed, and when someone gets on a waterbed, you can feel exactly where they get on it, and you'll hear the water slosh around - and this was exactly what happened.  I kicked out with my leg, still cowering underneath the covers, thinking it was maybe the cat that had jumped on my bed.

There was nothing there.

I got up the courage to jump out of bed and throw the light on.  There was nothing in the room, but the door was halfway open, and I always slept with the door closed.  My parents were both still in bed - neither of them had gotten up...but here was the real kicker: the cat was outside...the cat wasn't even in the house at the time of this occurring.  I have no explanation for this.

In no way can I say that using the Ouija board caused any of this (and the scientific, rational part of my mind recoils in horror at this), but I have no explanation as to these events.

For the record, I have not used the Ouija board since, and I have no desire to ever use one again.

Thanks for reading, it felt good to get all this off my chest.

90,my faith keeps me safe.  even though i've messed up a lot and was agnostic.,1300127131,"over a year ago, i had some serious stuff in my life happen to me that was extended from trying to hide from a lot of gang members.  they actually followed me around town, which i knew to be true because they would say things like when i was on a date... a random person that knew me would say something specifically about the reason of why they follow me.  they thought i was a narc.  one guy on a date i was having in a restaurant said as he's paying and looking over at me... ""in the damn narc box.... figures""....  lot of other things were happening too.
so.. needless to say, i became a bit paranoid protecting my house from the heavier and more effed up type of gang members around town that were threatening me.

because i was being followed and i knew the cops were a part of it, as well as something else happening to where i thought i was being framed for murder, i actually thought i was being video taped in my room.
i knew i'd been tried to be framed because a cop that pulled me over one night for having only one headlight, asked me if i'd robbed a bank, kidnapped someone or stolen a car...  with a mystified ""no"", he let me go with a ticket...   at a later date, when i was in county for traffic tickets, they actually asked me if i was a terrorist.  supposedly some guy with 'my name' was a terrorist and they thought it might be me.  that's not counting the random gang members that would know my name before ever saying hi to them in the county jail.

so yeah...

i'm sittin in my room, all self-inflicted house arrest style to keep out of view and out of mind so things would simmer down, and things got wierd.
i started to have serious conversations with someone that i thought was a cop fuckin with me illegally through feedback on the camera.  i didn't give a shit, and i used the whole deal as protection.   and i thought it was really a camera because the conversation would let me know shit ahead of time when i left the house...  like the way people would react to me...  so i totally believed it.

well..  shit got wierd.
something else happened.  the voice i heard wouldn't stop talking, and i knew something was fucked up.  it was literally a fucking minute by minute, daily by daily fight for months to keep myself sane.  noises, wierd shit, things just kept happening day in and day out all darn day long.

and i was sane.  i've never had anything like that in my entire life and i'm 28.  i actually used to be agnostic, uncaring, and just did what the hell ever i wanted to.  i'd always wanted to think something was up there because of an experience i had with a ghost back in 02, but i never really cared.

that voice started in on every single bit of my weaknesses.  bad things i did in the past that i thought i needed to fix...   ppl that might have died because of my actions.  that sorta thing.  things got so effed up that it put me in tears more than a few times with me being on the ragged edge of just wanting it to stop.

i started seeing a lot of really fucking freaky shit.   and the whole fucking reason i couldn't just forget it and think it was bullshit, *ignoring the fact that they wouldn't leave me alone*, was that they would tell me shit in advance to it happening...  so it would totally eff me up, knowing that it's real.
that... and i could feel physical things happening around me.  bumps in the house, compression thumps on the floor... and more that i can't tell you, a lot more.  ...and besides that, i couldn't just leave and go find another place to live cuz i live with family cuz due to lack of job from all that bull around the city.  ...and i was making sure nothing ever happened to my family because of my mistakes with gangs in county jails.

it became a battle in my head, and messing with stuff i shouldn't... like trying to save 'black souls'...   it was really really really really really really really fucked up and i wanted it to stop.   they'd say they'd leave me alone, and wait for me to feel ok to bother me again.

well...
one day, the voices changed, and it was a peaceful but strict and caring single voice.  i just already knew it was an angel, but in my heart felt like someone really good was there.  i never saw them, but i knew how they were, what they looked like, and knew i could trust them even after all those times all that other bs told me this and that and put my faith and trust on complete edge.

told me to get in my car and drive.
told me which direction to go.
i ended up stopping on a hill west of here, right before sunset.  they told me 'i'd never see a sunset like this again'.

there is a valley on the other side of the hill.  there was a storm front moving east towards me and the sun setting behind it.  the storm front had clear skies above it.  they told me to look at certain things.  and i saw some really great things... but then they told me to look at the whole sky.

and i saw God's hand and wrist stretched acrossed the sky.  it was one singular cloud, and it was perfectly ...perfectly.. formed into a hand with the palm pointed down.  they said, ""look down"".

on the front of the storm front, the clouds sorta opened up and there was a hill with a cross on top.  there was people walking up the hill.  the cross rose off the hill and faded as it rose to the hand.

it took up the entire skyline.

................

deal is.. it changed my life, but ya know.. it kinda brought me into His light while at the same time into His view too.

things were great for a while, but i ended up making a lot of choices that made it worse for me cuz i was always trying to just go back to living the way i was before because i wasn't able to keep the same friends and them still care while i was changed like that.  i wanted to go to bars, be with chicks, listen to the same music, do whatever i wanted...  but i was fighting myself because I knew what was true now.

so i kept doing stupid things.  well..  that vision gave me the faith to fight off some really bad stuff that's messed with me.
some. really. bad. things.

some. really. bad. dreams.   and really. effed up. stuff.

i still try to fight to this day.   but i'll never be able to not believe Jesus is real because of what's happened to me.  He still loves everyone that's got a good heart no matter what they believe.  

i can never make up my mind sometimes whether i wish i'd had just had all those problems that never led to spiritual stuff, but i wouldn't have known what's really true.

think of me what you want, with what i've seen i don't really give a damn what people think of me...   cuz they have no idea how much they need to know the damn truth.    

you really don't want to fuckin know the type of shit i've dealt with.  especially the damn dreams.  thing is... during a dream, no matter how bad it is you just go with it cuz you're there and doing it...  when you're wide awake and shit's happening around you... that's the effed up part... you can't really do anything.  sides ignore it.  pray for help.  do your best to deserve it.  angels are loving and caring, but got some serious tough love.

like i said.. think what you want...   i've already been called a lot of stuff over the past year of going through all this.

i tell you what... sides that huge vision i had, the thing that really gives me some good faith again is during those really bad dreams and i ask for Jesus to help me, and i snap awake no matter what i'm going through.",nosleep,ochn77,/r/nosleep/comments/g3tsu/my_faith_keeps_me_safe_even_though_ive_messed_up/
91,My roommate.,1300119693,"When I was applying for housing in my first year of college I knew that I did not want a roommate.  I checked the box marked ""single"" and was later given a small room with a shared bathroom on the top floor.  

I liked living alone, but I definitely missed out a little on the dorm experience.  My friends were all meeting new people on their floors and having dorm parties, but my floor with it's single rooms was full of introverts who kept their doors shut and their voices low.  I rarely saw anyone.

It was about a month in that I started to notice things.  Sometimes things would not be where I left them.  Other times my door would shake or my window would wobble.  I told myself that it was just an old building and all of these sounds and movements were just its ancient bones settling into a more comfortable position.  

One night my window slammed shut.  This wouldn't be notable except the windows were designed to keep drunk teens from falling out.  They opened inward and angled up.  It took a considerable amount of strength to move the rusted joints of the windows out or push them back in.  Soon after that the door began to shake uncontrollably every time I turned the lights out.   I took to leaving a small lamp on in my closet and sliding its door open a crack.  This made me a little more comfortable and I slept easier for a while, even with the shaking door. Then the closet door started sliding on its own.  I would wake up to the door fully open, light blaring in my face, or the door fully shut, alone in the dark, vibrating.  

I never felt terrified.  Something about this presence did not seem malicious.  In fact, it made me want to start researching ghosts.  I lived in the midwest and had always heard about haunted roads and such.  I thought I would see if I could find the most haunted place near my university and give it a visit.  A quick google search yielded the top 100 haunted places in my state.  

I remember very clearly the feeling I had when I saw my university on the list.  I remember the way my face dropped and that slight and persistent feeling of fear began to tear at the back of my head when I read the name of my dorm.  I remember looking around when I saw my wing and floor listed.  I remember leaving my room immediately thereafter.  

It turns out a young girl had thrown herself down the stairs after fighting with her boyfriend 20 years earlier.  The stairway was the kind that elbowed in frequently, so you would think that death would be unlikely in such a circumstance.  She must have landed in some odd way because she snapped her neck.  Then she never left.  

I don't really have a conclusion.  There is no bang or big scare because nothing like that ever happened. After finding out about the girl I only had one other incident that was of note.  I was lying in bed reading a book and was suddenly overcome with this intense and painful feeling.  My chest felt like it was being twisted into something new and I felt my mind teetering on some unseen edge.  I instantly felt the need to leave my room, she did not want me there.  I went downstairs and read until nightfall and when I returned to my room, all was quiet.  

When I finally left I didn't hold any ill will towards the girl, we had existed together more peacefully than most of the roommates I knew that year.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g3qy8/my_roommate/
92,Tiny irregularities,1300119657,"I'm a very heavy sleeper, and it takes a great deal to wake me up. I live next to a railway, and sleep right through the freight trains every night. So when I found myself staring at my alarm clock on my bedside table, glaring ""3.33 AM"" less than a foot away from my face, it confused me. Partly because clearly something had woken me, but what disturbed me the most was that I don't remember opening my eyes. I just found myself endlessly staring at the alarm clock, wide awake, with no memory of anything after brushing my teeth that night. I don't even remember going to bed.

As I was wondering what happened to my night, the alarm clock blinked over to ""3.34"". For some reason the change made me jump. I would usually laugh off such a silly reaction, but I just couldn't conquer my sense of fear at that moment. As I slowly turned over to face the other way, in an embarrassing effort to prevent myself from jumping at ""3.35"", I couldn't help but notice how astoundingly silent it was. I've never experienced anything like this. In every other situation I've believed myself to be in absolute silence, the room has had the slightest hum that can't really be identified or noticed until its removed. I couldn't hear my girlfriend sleeping next to me, or the sound of the water boiler humming, or even the gentle breeze outside. This was absolute silence. I cleared my throat, just to make a sound and at least determine that I wasn't deaf. The resulting noise pierced the silence so sharply it felt like being stabbed. There was something highly unusual about all of this, I just couldn't put my finger on it.

I propped myself up and looked around the room, as though I would find the cause of the silence. My bedroom was naturally very dark and the only source of light was from a lamppost across the other side of the street, being filtered through my curtains. As I looked around I saw a shadow which didn't belong in the room. I would have never guessed, but the subconsciousness is good at working these things out. As my eyes began to focus further and further off into the distance, the shadow began to take shape and I noticed I was actually looking at something physical. My heart sank when I noticed it looking back at me. He looked almost like a young boy, except the proportions didn't seem right. His arms were only slightly too long, his torso was only slightly too thin, his eye sockets were only slightly too large, but these tiny irregularities were a world away from how a person should look, even a child.

As I stared deep into the blackness of his eyes, unable to look away, I began to sweat profusely. I was burning up, and getting hotter every relentless second. My heart was beating so hard that I could feel it in my head. My arms were shaking so much, I could barely keep my upper body propped up. We had a connection. We were looking at each other dead in the eye, and he remained completely motionless. He was standing in the corner of my room, calmly watching. He was aware that I knew of his presence, and that didn't concern him. He could have ran at me, he could have attacked me, and in my mind I begged him to, because if he attacked me I would know what to do. I would try to defend myself. But he didn't need to attack me, he was already exactly where he needed to be. He knew it, I knew it.

I was staring at him for what seemed like the longest few minutes of my life, when something to the left of me made me violently jump. I quickly looked over to see my alarm click blink to ""4.24"". Realising the mistake I made, I shot my head back round, only to find him gone. It was only after darting my eyes around the room looking for him, that I realised it couldn't possibly be 4.24. Staring into his eyes felt like an eternity, but in reality I knew that it couldn't have been more than a few minutes. Once I had started to relax and cool down, I decided I must have been having vivid nightmare. I turned away from the alarm clock and hugged my girlfriend from behind, and tried to sleep. As I started to drift off, I couldn't help but think that my girlfriend felt slightly different from her usual self. Her torso was only slightly too thin, and her skin was only slightly too rough, but these tiny irregularities were a world away from how a person should feel.",nosleep,RoosterSheep,/r/nosleep/comments/g3qxq/tiny_irregularities/

95,A Weekend Alone,1300114366,"I'm telling you this before I have the chance to dismiss this weekends activities and tack rational explanations onto what has happened to me these past three days. I don't have a logical explanation, though I'm not sure I am able to admit that these events are rooted in the supernatural, because the implications of acknowledging a world beyond this one is just too huge. 

I live in a large house that overlooks the river Taff in South Wales. There are seven bedrooms, though only five of us live here. The house is very old and prone to creaking and, for want of a better word, coughing, though until this weekend nothing more unusual than the odd stray noise has occured. 

This weekend my four housemates had all independently arranged to return to their hometowns. This isn't unusual, but it is the first time any of us has stayed home alone for a prolonged amount of time. I stayed, with the hope that I might get some work done and enjoy a bit of peace. This was not to be. 

On friday night, at around eleven I was in the lounge watching Jacobs Ladder. It is perhaps important to note that yes, I was feeling slightly nervous due to the films content. Though I had the lights on, the house is always very dark, owing to the low ceilings and clutter that five boys own and I was enjoying the creepy feeling of spooking myself a little. Midway through the film, among the usual noises the house makes I heard a distinctive, loud, dragging sound in the room above me. 

I'm not afraid to say I was terrified. I sat bolt in the chair, muted the film and listened. There was no further noise, and in the course of listening I absently lit a cigarette, and noticed that my hand was shaking. After waiting a few minutes I decided to check, not knowing what I was checking for and certainly not wanting to find anything. I turned on all of the lights downstairs, including those in rooms I didn't need to pass through and made my way upstairs, calling out hello as I went.

The noise had come from my housemate Phil's room, and after knocking the door and announcing I was coming in I entered. Switching on the light I immediately noticed his wardrobe was about two feet away from the wall, jutting out completely un-naturally. Though I couldn't know if he'd had reason to move it before he'd left, it spooked me a little. I closed his door and walked back down the stairs trying to talk myself down. When I got to the bottom of the stairs, I heard the scraping noise again, definately from Phil's room. I bolted through the house, picking up my cigarettes and straight into the back-garden. I stood outside, smoking one after another, and phoned Phil. I asked him if he had moved his wardrobe before leaving and he was fairly sure he hadn't, though admitted that he could have. He didn't seem concerned, and his friendly joking manner calmed me enough that I returned to the house. I decided it probably wasn't best to watch the rest of the film, and instead found myself watching light-hearted shows and soon relaxing. 

About an hour past, and I'd decided that I'd just let myself fall asleep in the chair in the comfort of the living room. I was dozing when I heard a door upstairs open, close and then heard footsteps on the landing. They were heavy and distinct, like boots. I immediately ran outside again, my hairs standing on end and shivering so much that my back ached. I ran straight from the garden and around to the front of the house, where both Phil's room and the landing had windows. I backed away, staring up at the windows hoping to see some movement and considering calling the police. I'm not sure why I didn't, but feeling somewhat ridiculous standing outside in my pj's shivering and smoking myself to death I eventually went back inside. On my way in I picked up a large rock from the garden and called out several times. No one answered and as I tentatively explored the house there was no one to be found. I was still very scared, though everything seemed as it should be, I felt like someone was in the house with me. I half jokingly asked aloud if I should leave, but there was no answer. 

Somehow I settled back into a chair, rock to hand and chose the chair against the wall. I stayed awake until around 7am, watching TV and listening out the entire time, but there were no further noises, and when the sun was mostly up and the night seemed far enough away I drifted off for a few hours, and all seemed fine. 

When I woke on Saturday I felt foolish, and chided myself for getting so wound up. at lunchtime my girlfriend Katy came over and within a few hours I'd completely forgotten how scared I'd been. I didn't mention anything about the night before to Katy.

Late in the afternoon I was making a tea in the kitchen when she screamed from the bathroom and ran down the stairs. She was ashen and shaking, and swore that she'd just seen a man standing in the doorway of the bathroom. She was shouting at me as though it was my fault, and was very upset. Though I was terrified, in the light of day, with another person in the house I felt brave enough to once again search the house. I noticed that Phil's wardrobe seemed to have moved again, but otherwise there was nothing unusual and certainly no man. Katy had followed me, and I recognised that she too had somehow talked herself down. Once back downstairs, mugs of tea from which to sip strength, she described the man as being very short, maybe just over five foot tall. She said he seemed dirty and unkempt, with hair not unlike Edward Scissorhands. We ended up laughing about this, though I think both of us were probably acting braver than we felt. She said he was distinct, not a shadow or transparent, and though she couldn't describe how he was dressed he was definately there. 

We drank our tea and went to the pub a short walk away. I told her about the night before and we laughed at ourselves, both agreeing that there would be a rational explanation. A few pints later I was ready to punch Casper on his fat round nose, any thoughts of the spooky were laughed off. We walked home. As soon as we entered the house my bravery slunk away. The doors that I had left open when switching on all the lights were closed. Things seemed to have moved, though I can't be sure, but the house just looked off somehow. And it was freezing. Katy didn't seem to notice and I didn't want to spook her so I set about cooking dinner and tried my best to ignore the dread that felt.

At around nine we both heard the footsteps on the landing. Katy picked up the rock that was in the living room and I took a knife from the kitchen and made my way to the foot of the stairs. I stood listening, and the footsteps continued, pacing the floor above me. I called out, shouting 'ENOUGH' though I'm not sure why. The footsteps stopped, there was a short pause and I could hear the blood pumping in my ears. Then there was a huge gusting noise and two doors upstairs slammed, one after another. Katy and I grabbed keys, wallets and phones and ran outside. We spent the night at her parents, who giggled and dismissed our fears and made us feel very foolish.

On sunday Katy and I both returned to the house, though both of us were still scared, we really had no where else to be. The atmosphere was horrible and every creak, squeak and groan had us looking at each other. We tried to watch the TV but neither of us were taking it in and we ended up just watching the static between channels as we flipped through. Sure enough, after about 45 minutes of being there we heard the dragging sound. I'd already explained to Katy about the wardrobe and she agreed it sounded like furniture moving above us. And hour later Katy swears she heard a giggle, though I didn't hear anything. She asked if we could stay at her parents again, and though I wanted to I already felt like a fool and that her Dad had laughed when we'd told him made me feel like staying. She was upset by this, though wanted to stay with me.

Around nine again we both jumped, three huge booms came from upstairs. It sounded like a door being slammed repeatedly. Katy whimpered, like a dog, and her eyes watered. She looked at me, and I felt completely helpless. I stood at the foot of the stairs and could see the bathroom door swinging on it's hinges. I was shaking. Katy stood behind me and begged again that we leave. I wanted to, I really did, but felt that I should stay. Again she reluctantly agreed to stay with me. 

We returned to the living room and were sat for about twenty minutes when I heard the footsteps on the landing again. By this point I'm not ashamed to admit that I had tears in my eyes too. Katy gripped my arm tightly and without speaking we began to collect our things up. The footsteps got faster, and then I heard them on the stairs, running down the stairs, the sound of  a hand sliding on the bannister accompanying them. We both ran out of the house again, both yelping. We stayed at her parents again last night. 

I know that this isn't the most dramatic of stories, that footsteps on the stairs and slamming doors are the diet-coke compared to other peoples encounters with the supernatural, but this is what happened and it was terrifying. My housemates return today, and no doubt I'll be mocked mercilessly by them when they hear about all of this, but I'm genuinely scared. Apologies if this seems rushed, I was just trying to get it all down before it became lost to more cynical thoughts. 

/edited a few typos I caught, no doubt there are more. Again, sorry for rushing, I'm tired and very confused. ",nosleep,stesal,/r/nosleep/comments/g3p2c/a_weekend_alone/
96,my Faith keeps me safe.  even though i've made a lot of mistake and used to be agnostic.,1300114182,"for a long time i've been dealing with demons in my room.  but they bother me other places.  the real kind.

over a year ago, i had some serious stuff in my life happen to me that was extended from trying to hide from a lot of gang members.  they actually followed me around town, which i knew to be true because they would say things like when i was on a date... a random person that knew me would say something specifically about the reason of why they follow me.  they thought i was a narc.  one guy on a date i was having in a restaurant said as he's paying and looking over at me... ""in the damn narc box.... figures""....  
so.. needless to say, i became a bit paranoid protecting my house from the heavier and more effed up type of gang members around town that were threatening me.

i began to try to know what was going to happen ahead of time by thinking.... a lot...  and well..   because i was being followed and i knew the cops were a part of it, as well as something else happening to where i thought i was being framed for murder, i actually thought i was being video taped in my room.
i knew i'd been tried to be framed because a cop that pulled me over one night for having only one headlight, asked me if i'd robbed a bank, kidnapped someone or stolen a car...  with a mystified ""no"", he let me go with a ticket...   at a later date, when i was in county for traffic tickets, they actually asked me if i was a terrorist.  supposedly some guy with 'my name' was a terrorist and they thought it might be me.

so yeah...

i'm sittin in my room, all self-inflicted house arrest style to keep out of view and out of mind so things would simmer down, and things got wierd.
i started to have serious conversations with someone that i thought was a cop fuckin with me illegally through feedback on the camera.  i didn't give a shit, and i used the whole deal as protection.

well..  shit got wierd.
something else happened.  the voice i heard wouldn't stop talking, and i knew something was fucked up.  it was literally a fucking minute by minute, daily by daily fight for months to keep myself sane.  noises, wierd shit, things just kept happening day in and day out all darn day long.

and i was sane.  i've never had anything like that in my entire life and i'm 28.  i actually used to be agnostic, uncaring, and just did what the hell ever i wanted to.  i'd always wanted to think something was up there because of an experience i had with a ghost back in 02, but i never really cared.

that voice started in on every single bit of my weaknesses.  bad things i did in the past that i thought i needed to fix...   ppl that might have died because of my actions.  that sorta thing.  things got so effed up that it put me in tears more than a few times with me being on the ragged edge of just wanting it to stop.

i started seeing a lot of really fucking freaky shit.   and the whole fucking reason i couldn't just forget it and think it was bullshit, *ignoring the fact that they wouldn't leave me alone*, was that they would tell me shit in advance to it happening...  so it would totally eff me up, knowing that it's real.  ...and besides that, i couldn't just leave and go find another place to live cuz i live with family cuz due to lack of job from all that bull around the city.  ...and i was making sure nothing ever happened to my family because of my mistakes with gangs in county jails.

it became a battle in my head, and messing with stuff i shouldn't... like trying to save 'black souls'...   it was really really really really really really really fucked up and i wanted it to stop.   they'd say they'd leave me alone, and wait for me to feel ok to bother me again.

well...
one day, the voices changed, and it was a peaceful but strict and caring single voice.  i just already knew it was an angel, but in my heart felt like someone really good was there.  i never saw them, but i knew how they were, what they looked like, and knew i could trust them even after all those times all that other bs told me this and that and put my faith and trust on complete edge.

told me to get in my car and drive.
told me which direction to go.
i ended up stopping on a hill west of here, right before sunset.  they told me 'i'd never see a sunset like this again'.

there is a valley on the other side of the hill.  there was a storm front moving east towards me and the sun setting behind it.  the storm front had clear skies above it.  they told me to look at certain things.  and i saw some really great things... but then they told me to look at the whole sky.

and i saw God's hand and wrist stretched acrossed the sky.  it was one singular cloud, and it was perfectly ...perfectly.. formed into a hand with the palm pointed down.  they said, ""look down"".

on the front of the storm front, the clouds sorta opened up and there was a hill with a cross on top.  there was people walking up the hill.  the cross rose off the hill and faded as it rose to the hand.

it took up the entire skyline.

................

now, i've been dealing with a lot of stuff.  really really bad stuff.

i've had a lot of choices that made it worse for me cuz i was always trying to just go back to living the way i was before because i wasn't able to keep the same friends and them still care while i was changed like that.  i wanted to go to bars, be with chicks, listen to the same music, do whatever i wanted...  but i was fighting myself because I knew what was true now.

so i kept doing stupid things.  well..  that vision gave me the faith to fight off some really bad stuff that's messed with me.
some. really. bad. things.

some. really. bad. dreams.   and really. effed up. stuff.

i still try to fight to this day.   but i'll never be able to not believe Jesus is real because of what's happened to me.  He still loves everyone that's got a good heart no matter what they believe.  

i can never make up my mind sometimes whether i wish i'd had just had all those problems that never led to spiritual stuff, but i wouldn't have known what's really true.

think of me what you want, with what i've seen i don't really give a damn what people think of me...   cuz they have no idea how much they need to know the damn truth.    

you really don't want to fuckin know the type of shit i've dealt with.  especially the damn dreams.  thing is... during a dream, no matter how bad it is you just go with it cuz you're there and doing it...  when you're wide awake and shit's happening around you... that's the effed up part... you can't really do anything.  sides ignore it.  pray for help.  do your best to deserve it.  angels are loving and caring, but got some serious tough love.

like i said.. think what you want...   i've already been called a lot of stuff over the past year of going through all this.

i tell you what... sides that huge vision i had, the thing that really gives me some good faith again is during those really bad dreams and i ask for Jesus to help me, and i snap awake no matter what i'm going through....don't freaking ask.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g3p14/my_faith_keeps_me_safe_even_though_ive_made_a_lot/
97,black eyed kids,1300100633,"I’M A MARINE stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. I live in the infantry barracks off of River Road. I recently had a rather strange encounter with a pair of black-eyed kids.

I live on the third floor of the barracks that have open walkways on the outside and the rooms on the inside. This happened on a weekend back in November, 2009. It was a weekend, so almost every Marine was out, either home, drinking or sleeping; only a handful were left in the barracks awake. I’d stayed in that weekend because I was broke and had no money to go out.

I was watching a movie when I heard a knock at my door. Figuring it was my roommate who’d lost his key again, I went and opened it. Instead of a drunken roommate, I found two little kids standing on the walkway – only these kids freaked the hell out of me. I don’t know what it was about them, but as a Marine we’re always told to listen to that little voice in your head, because it just might save your life from an IED (improvised explosive device). Right then that voice was screaming at me to shut the door and lock it.

THE PLEA

There was also the fact that these kids had absolutely pitch-black eyes. I mean no white or any other color to them whatsoever – just black. But I pushed those things aside and asked them what they were doing there so late. They responded by saying that it was really cold out and they wanted to come in and read. I was confused as hell, because I’ve never met a kid that wants to read. Also, there was no mention of any parents or anything else you’d expect a lost couple of kids to say.

I couldn’t take my eyes of their pitch-black eyes; it was like they were sucking me in. I felt horrible and was suddenly frightened for my life, like I needed to immediately take cover. They just stared at me, with those goddam eyes.

I took a quick look up and down the walkway to see if any other Marines were out, but there was nobody in site. I turned back to the kids who I noticed had taken a step forward toward me. I got the feeling like I was being hunted, like these kids where predators and out for their next meal or something. Instinct gave way to reason and I decided to listen to that voice and shut the door and locked it.

I heard soft constant knocking for the next five minutes before I heard my window rattle and then nothing. I went down to the officer on duty the next morning and asked him about it and he said he hadn’t heard of or seen any kids in the area at all, and dismissed it saying that I’d probably had too much to drink last night. Only I hadn’t been drinking at all or anything like that that night. I don’t know what or who those kids were, but I doubt any of the families here would let their kids wander around at night on a military base.

As a child, I'd often stay up at night and read with a flashlight. I wasn't supposed to be awake past my bedtime, so I'd take care not to be caught by my father. Most nights he and I were the only ones home, as my mother worked the nightshift as a nurse. Because my father was right down the hallway, I could hear his snoring very audibly as I'd read. Sometimes, however, he'd wake up and walk around. Since he is a heavyset man, his footsteps would thump upon the floor. If I heard his footsteps, I would immediately turn off the flashlight to avoid trouble, just in case he saw the light under the door. 
A few memorable times, I'd hear the thumping footsteps come down the hall and stop in front of my door. I'd immediately turn off the light. At the same time, however, I could still hear my dad, snoring soundly down the hall. ",nosleep,Overpants,/r/nosleep/comments/g3lee/footsteps/
0,Not my favorite way to wake up,1300089809,"A little background first.  I live in North Philly, in what would be considered not the best of neighborhoods, and the house I was in last year was a dilapidated piece of shit to say the least.  Me and my room mates decided to get a dog from the local pspca earlier in the year - best decision ever, by the way.  She is awesome, pure white 65-70 lb pit/dogo mix she looks like.    But I digress.

She was sleeping in my room that night, taking up most of the bed...again.  During the night I woke up, couldn't tell you why.  I just opened my eyes and kind of sat up and felt a little uneasy.  It didn't help to look over at the dog and notice that she was already awake, in full alert mode - ears perked, head up, body stiff, nose twitching.  She was staring at the window out towards my windows that faced the street.  I couldn't see out the windows because they had these awful orangish-red curtains on them that I usually kept closed.  

I went to pet her to calm her down and felt that her hackles were straight up, going all the way down her back and into her tail.  Red flag right there.  Usually when her hackles raise it is just the area around her neck, but she had a ridge going all the way down her back and she still hadn't take her eyes away from the window. 
My hand was still on her and I felt the growl before I heard it, it was low and menacing.  She doesn't usually act like this.

Then there was a noise from directly outside (my windows sucked, I could literally stick my hand outside through the shitty framing)  She jumped off the bed and erupted in barking, not the ""oh hey im excited bark"" the ""i feel threatened, there is something wrong"" kind.  I immediately got up, grabbed the bat I keep handy on the side of the bed and opened the door to my room, she ran out and went straight to the front door, still barking and hackles standing at attention, but she planted herself a few feet in front of the door and seemed to refuse to get any closer.
If your not familiar with row houses in philly, they are basically the width of one room and 3 stories tall, my bedroom was the first room you could enter after walking into the house so basically walking out of my room I would turn right and the front door was about 7 feet away. 

None of my room mates woke up from the noise, which was a miracle in it self because the dog was going ape shit at the front door. It took me a good few minutes to get the courage up to go up and look through the peep hole.  
There was nothing there.  I didn't open the door for further examination, standing in my boxers holding a mini bat didnt really lend itself to me being courageous.  She stopped barking but never really calmed down and her tail was pretty firmly planted in between her legs.  So after a few minutes of my standing there thinking wtf just happened and her standing beside me staring at the door, we went back in the room.  Although I was thoroughly shaken, I eventually fell back asleep, but from what I could tell she didn't have any plans to do the same.  She kinda just layed on my bed in that same alert position staring at the window.  I've never seen her react like that since.

Anyways sorry if this was kind of long and/or anticlimactic to any of you, but I still think about this every now and then it really scared the shit out of me at the time.

1,Random happenings around my home,1300086641,"Not exactly prime-time viewing type creepy but at the time they certainly were.

I've lived in my house for about 3 years now but in the first 6 months or so I came across some pretty damn creepy things.

A quick bit of context: I live alone and at the time had two small dogs. Down one side of my house is a strip of gravel that goes past the laundry and kitchen; side access from a gate at the front. My bedroom is at the front of the house with pretty big windows (roughly 7ft x 7ft) and the front door is about 6ft from one of them.

I have a few friends who also live in the suburb who sometimes decide to drop in at random if they see my car in the driveway and they know the front door is never locked if I'm at home.

At the end of my first week living there I was laying in bed on the Saturday morning and was fast asleep. Just at the front of the house is a small patch of course gravel (some random decoration that works as an early warning) and I hear a footstep in the gravel that wakes me up and then two steps on the concrete which would put that person right outside my window, not at the door.

At this stage I'm in that groggy state where I'm aware there is someone outside but decide to ignore it unless they knock. I don't even open my eyes and I start to drift back to sleep when I hear sinister snickering from outside the window. Still not willing to so much as open my eyes or properly wake up I continue to try getting back to sleep when I hear a gravely voice whisper ""get out"" and more sinister snickering.

I assume at this point its one of my friends being lame and ignore it. Within about three seconds I hear it again but louder. I ignore this second attempt at a lame prank when suddenly I feel someone's breath on my face and from what sounds to be right at the tip of my nose I hear this same voice yell ""GET. OUT!"". These words went right through me - not only did I hear them but I FELT them. I was overcome with a feeling of dread and violence.

My heart rate went through the roof, I felt such an adrenaline rush that my chest and fingertips were throbbing with terror and I simultaneously open my eyes and jump straight across the room in the other direction breathing heavy and looking for the person who just screamed in my face.

I run out of my bedroom and rip the front door open to find... nothing. Nobody is there and my dogs look at me from their bed in the lounge room as though confused at my urgency; if someone walked through the hallway they would have made all kinds of commotion. My windows were all closed and I have security screens on each.

This happened three times in the first fortnight and I seriously considered moving out.

About 3 months later I was asleep and at about 2AM I woke up to find myself already propped up on my bed, leaning on my hands behind me. As I open my eyes I see something white just beside my bed roughly in line with my knees. I blink hard thinking I have something in my eye or on my eyelashes and expect it to go away but instead I see it more clearly. Its a small child just glaring at me with dark eyes and incredible intensity. I blink twice more in quick succession and disbelief as my face screws up in an expression of uncontrolled fear then I see him slowly fade. I immediately check my door and windows and they're all closed. There was nothing in that direction of my room that was even close to white that I could have mistakenly thought was a person... I don't believe in the supernatural at all but I saw a child and he didn't seem happy. Think the [small boy](http://www.scaryandfun.com/ScaryPopUpFaces_files/image026.jpg) from The Grudge.

Those particular instances definitely had me rattled because on neither occasion could I figure out exactly what had happened. From there it was just a series of small things. I was sitting at  my computer in the spare room which runs off the hallway, about 20 ft from the front door and I'm facing the doorway. Out of nowhere I hear someone call my dogs in a soft voice by name; whoever this person was my dogs were clearly familiar with them so I relax, waiting for whichever friend it was to carry on down the hallway.

After about 10 seconds of what sounds like someone petting my dogs I decide to get up and go see who it is... both of them are sitting at the front door looking back toward me and nobody is around. I open my front door and see that the screen door is still closed. My front screen makes a very distinct click as it opens and closes and it can literally be heard from out the back of my house so if someone had opened the door, come inside then left I definitely would have heard this click.

I check out front for a friend's car or something and find nobody there.

Then there were the ""usual"" things people assume to be supernatural that I can't exactly explain but figured were just malfunctions of some form. My stereo would sometimes turn on at random. The taps in my bathroom would be off as I walk to the toilet but I turn around sometimes to find them on about 1/2 a turn (I'm not a small guy, if anything my problem is over-tightening taps). The same thing would sometimes happen with the shower too, I'd walk past and hear nothing - walk back past a few minutes later and the shower would be dribbling like it had been given at least half a turn. Whenever the water was running like this I could tighten them at least the half-turn.

I'm tired so my writing ability kind of blows right now but these events are all entirely real. I haven't had to deal with them for a couple of years now but even recounting the events has literally made me shiver on several occasions.",nosleep,Atheizt,/r/nosleep/comments/g3khy/random_happenings_around_my_home/

The city is composed of windowless skyscrapers, perhaps more accurately a set of giants slabs of useless concrete. They scale up towards the city center and more or less form a circle. The city is off in the distance, and no matter how long I walk, I can never reach it. The skies look as if it's about to rain, and yet, it never does.

3,In the back room,1300081721,"I've tried to tell this to my close friends, but they brush it off like I'm a bullshitter.  I will never speak of it to my parents, I want to, but something inside me won't allow it. I'm under control, it seems.

 It happened at my first home, the one I grew up in. Situated in an exceptionally safe neighborhood, I hadn't to worry about bumps in the night. I lived with both of my parents who are, to this day, quite religious. A cross on the wall here, a meaningful bible verse hung on the wall over there. I could handle a little of it, so long as they didn't go overboard, which they hadn't. This house was of normal size. Single-story (with basement) 3 bedroom ranch. My bedroom was located in the basement. It was cool having a room in the basement. Secluded, you can do your own thing. You have your privacy. I could have people stay over for the night, be loud as hell, and my parents would never mention anything about the noise. It was awesome. Their room was on the main floor, on the opposite side of the house. I was 13 at the time, and had lived in this house all my life. I knew everything about it. I could walk around  it for hours with my eyes closed and not run into anything, except maybe the dog. 

Anyway, it was one night after football practice. Practice ended at 8, and I got a ride home from a good friend of mine's mom. She dropped me off and they continued on their way. I went in and did the usual - eat, chat with the parentals, shower, play some video games, not always in that order. I grabbed my pizza that had been cooking while I showered and headed down to my room. Angel, my dog, a small white freakin' fluffer poodle, followed me down. I love this dog more than anything. She licked her chops as she followed my plate down the steps to the basement. She kind of chunked down the stairs. After all, she too was 13 years old. I took a seat in the living area of the basement where the big TV was and the cool rocker video game chairs.

 I'm going to try to give you guys a bit of the layout of my basement. When looking at the TV - to my right is a large couch pushed up against the wall, facing me. Above the couch, in the corner kinda, is one of those weird little windows, the ones that people are creeped out by. Directly behind me are the stairs, and next to those a large, 9 seater bar curls across the room. We are irish. It is a must to have a bar I guess. If you follow the bar, it ends and you continues down the hallway to the back room (furnace, laundry, water heater, etc.) which is closed off by folding doors, the kinds used for closets, only shittier. Along the right side of the hall, before the doors is the door to my room. OK. I hope it kinda makes sense.

Anyway, again, I was sitting, eating my pizza and watching a taped copy of the Tom Green Show. Angel sat next to me, watching piece of pizza after piece of pizza go into my mouth. I had the lights off, because why not? I kept glancing at the window up in the corner, and it began to bug me out. I decided to put a couple couch pillows into the window. I was always creeped by that window. As I was doing so, Angel balanced on the arm of a chair and licked away what grease and cheese was left on the plate I set on the end table. I put in one pillow, and hopped down off the top of the couch to grab another. The TV was still on, illuminating things in the room, creating weird shadows. Commercials played on the tape.

 This is when shit got fucked.

 As I grabbed for the second pillow, the tape kind of skipped it seemed. Or that's what I wanted to think. You know when a tape skips, it gets into, like, slow mo and sound gets distorted? I'm sure you do. The voice on the television got very deep, and I remember it catching my undivided attention. It was like someone was using one of those creepy voice changers.

 ""You can't hide from me. No one can."" 

At this, I froze. It was as if the voice didn't come from the TV. I hoped and hoped that it was just part of the tape. I didn't know why I honed in on this so intensely. It was directed at me, and I knew it, I could feel it. I dropped the pillow and skidded against the wall. I looked all over the basement, I was freaking out. The shadows from the TV, the dark hallway leading to the back room. The dark hallway to the back room. Oh fuck, my room is that way. The tape continued to play, but I paid no attention. I gathered myself and slowly moved to my room. Fuck turning off the TV. Fuck throwing out my plate. Fuck it. I made a dash to my room, but came to a halt before I could turn in. 

Angel sat in front of the doors to the back room. She stared blankly, not responding to my whispering her name. She moved but only, a few inches, scooting forward. I reached into my doorway and flipped on my light switch so it wasn't just that creepy glow from the TV in the other room. Angel whimpered at the door to the back room. No chance. I grabbed her and went into my room, closing the door behind me. 

I could breathe. The lights were on, Angel was here, good. I laid on my bed, lights still on, and fell asleep shortly thereafter. 

SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH!

 I shot up out of bed. Angel was scratching at the door to leave. Phew! It must be 7, or even 8 am. She's been in here all night, poor pup. I crawled to the end of my bed, reached out and opened my bedroom door. I noticed it was still dark outside of my room, with the TV in the living area still flickering. Angel walked out, but didn't go left toward the living room/stairs. She went right, directly towards the doors to the back room. I looked back at my desk to check the time.

 It was 12:06. I had been asleep for only a few minutes.

I remembered the situation from just moments ago, and began to freak out again. Maybe mom or dad had to come down for something? The lights are off. Fuck. The light from my room shone into the entry of the back room, but didn't reach its depths. I got up from my bed and slowly walked out of my room, poking my head out and peering down the 4 feet of space between me and the back room. The doors are open. Oh my god, the doors are open! Oh no! Angel! I thought up the worst possible scenarios in my head, then tried to convince myself I was being insane. I stepped out from my doorway and stood face to face with the open doors to the back room. Angel was in there, and I knew I couldn't just leave her alone in there. It was utterly terrifying.

The back room was L-shaped, if you turn the L 90 degrees clockwise. I couldn't see Angel's white body. She had to be around the corner. Around the corner is where the washer/dryer are, the furnace, sump pump, and also a window well along the left side. 

I got the courage to go into the room, planning on pulling the string to turn on the light back there. As I turned the corner to the right, I saw Angel. She sat, exactly as she had before when staring at the closed doors to the back room, staring into the darkness. I could only make out her whitish figure in the dark room. I tried so hard to see, but I couldn't I stepped forward to reach for the string to turn on the light. As I stepped forward, it happened again. The voice. The voice from the tape. Only, it couldn't have been from the tape.

""Come closer.""

 The deep, rumbling voice made me freeze. As much as I tried to scream and yell and run away and thrash, I could do nothing. I couldn't even blink. 

I felt Angel brush against my leg as she moved past me. NO! My eyes were outside of my head. Again, I could only make out Angel's white figure. Only, this time, I was able to make out another figure. It wasn't white like Angel. Rather, it was dark, darker than the darkness of the back room. It was the silhouette of a large man. I could make out arms, a head, but no legs. I began to cry. No sound, just tears.

I was going to die. I knew it. 

Angel paused in front of me, then continued forward to where I couldn't see her. She was right by the dark figure. Tears were streaming. I still couldn't move. This felt like Hell. In an instant, and I mean an instant, the temperature dropped. Again, for the last time, the voice spoke to me.

""We will meet once again, forever.""

Immediately following this, there was a weird flash, but not like a flash. It was a flash of darkness that whooshed past me. I felt controlled for a second. Something took me over. There was a bang in the window well. It was like someone put a quarter-stick in it. The rocks at the base shook, the glass shook, the grate at the top shook. Then, silence. 

I glanced around and saw nothing. No Angel, no dark figure, nothing. A ballsy move, I reached out and tugged the string to turn on the light. Ah the light. It felt soooo good. It was calming and relieving, a second heaven. But then I saw her, Angel. She lay motionless on her side in the corner of the room. I moved right to her, no fear anymore, for there was light. I touched her, and I could immediately tell she was dead. I couldn't stop thinking about the events that happened over only a period of 15 minutes or so. I was torn up by both the situation at hand, and the death of my long time best friend. I didn't know what to do. I grabbed Angel, clutched her to my chest, sat down, and cried for what seems forever. 

Did I see something I wasn't meant to see? I know who he is, I know what he wants, and I know he will be back.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g3jbg/in_the_back_room/

5,So this funny thing happened when I was a kid...,1300074315,"Late 80's. Power outage. My three friends and I were running around from building to building in a large urban community more commonly known as ""the projects."" As with any low income community where people are tightly packed together, there had been murders there from time to time, so running around in pitch black was scary enough. We'd open a new door to a new building, run across the hallway of the building screaming, then exit out the other side. It was a silly random thing to do.
Well, we opened up one door to see a hulking twisted figure behind the hallway door holding a machete. We couldn't see his face. He was just breathing deeply with the machete held high in the air. I slowly stumbled backwards and the door shut tight. We couldn't grasp what had just happened. One of my friends had the bright idea to run around the other side of the building and check out behind the guy. He said when he opened the door on the other side, there was the same exact figure looming over him in the same position. One might think it was the same man, but over his shoulder my friend could see down the hall and saw the other man in front of the other door in the same position. He slammed the door shut and we all went off running.

6,Power Room,1300074098,"I was a freshman when we moved to the city so I could attend a magnet high school down the street. Our home was a split level in a loft building, an old warehouse converted into apartments and condos with high ceilings and a very urban feel. One entered through the first floor, and my room was in the basement.

For the first few weeks I was shaken from my sleep on an almost daily basis by the sound of a child laughing from the other side of the wall. The gender wasn't certain, nor the age, but they would run and laugh loudly for a good half an hour at around 5 in the morning. I would bang on the wall but it would bring no cease, and so I brought it up with my father.

""There's no unit there, if anything you'd hear Bill's kid from the South wall but he doesn't seem much of a noisemaker."" He was right, Bill's kid wasn't noisy at all, but I wasn't sure about his understanding of the building's layout. I took the stairs for the first time, to the communal basement which wasn't more than a dusty hallway brightly lit by fluorescent lights. It wound through the tenant's basements and the dumpster at the base of the garbage chute, and it ended at a locked door that would open into a room adjacent to my own.

Discouraged, I walked away, but then remembered the key that every tenant had. It opened the front door, the back door, and at my attempt - this door.

There weren't any lights in this room, but still a buzzing was present. I brought out my flip phone and used what light it had on the floor, regretting my choice not to wear shoes. I walked in a few steps and held up the light. It shone on eight columns each adorned with its own electricity meter. They were all spinning, each buzzing quite loudly. The one furthest from me stopped with a click. The next closer to me stopped with a click. I didn't wait to hear the third, and I slammed the door behind me as I ran back through the hall and up the stairs.

I never heard the laughing again.",nosleep,jesuisdesole,/r/nosleep/comments/g3h1f/power_room/
7,"A recurring dream, not at all pleasant, but not terrifying",1300071945,"I had this dream several times several years ago, and while I know it was entirely a series of dreams, it was so vivid that at the time it was almost confusing as to whether there were real events involved.  There weren't, though it was a time of sadness and trouble for me, with the loss of several beloved family members in a short period, including my mother.

In my dream, I was in a big two story sort of victorian neocolonial farmhouse.  I have lived in a similar, though much smaller house, in my childhood,  In the dream, the house is divided in half for two families.  The circumstances vary, but in each of the dreams I need to get to the other side of the house unobserved in order to speak to someone in secret. or to see if someone is there, or simply to get into a certain room.

In every dream, there was one thing in common.  There would be a path that I would have to follow, and in that path was one point that was very constricted.  It would be a corner in a tiny dark pathway through an attic or inner structure that required a very specific sequence of movements of arms and legs and inhales and exhales and holding breath to squeeze through.  The memories of the physical sensations of that spot are as vivid or more so than pretty much anything I've ever experienced in real life.  I can vividly recall the smell of the lumber, and the dust, and the tiny beads of resin on the surface of the boards, and the pressures and the handholds that I used to pull through the narrow passage.

The end of the dream was always anticlimactic.  I would go into a room and there would be no one there, or I would look and see someone, which seemed to mean nothing.

I'm single and live alone, but the night of one of these dreams a good friend was sleeping over.  Not sure what happened, but she apparently moved to the couch in the middle of the night, and still won't say what happened, or spend the night again, and she really, really doesn't want to talk about it.

I use to live in a suburb of Buffalo, New York. The dream takes place at night, it starts off in my back yard/drive way, zooming up about 100 feet and over three or four yards to right over a neighbors back yard, their back porch light is on. Then it flys down to my perspective, I am sitting in a large wicker chair, that then suddenly breaks and I am on my back looking up to a vulture wearing a pilgrim hat, he is about 100 feet above me and is yelling at me, what ever it is, it is mad at me.

I've lived in 5 different houses in my life that I remember vividly. The dream would start as I walked up to one of the houses I'd lived with, it was always dark out, but not middle-of-the-night dark; more like late afternoon during winter.

I walk up to whichever house I saw that particular night, always with vague sense of dread that was easy enough to ignore, at that point. I open the front door, and as soon as I step into the house, I'm overcome by terror, and the inevitable realization that turning around and walking back out is no longer an option. A blonde, slightly trashy-looking woman walks down the stairs, layer upon layer of makeup plastered onto her face, and she forces a smile at me and asks if my mommy's home. 

At the word ""mommy"" her face changes entirely. Just for the duration of that word, her eyes get darker, her skin goes gray, and her smile becomes authentic, but more of a narrow grin. At that moment, I know something's wrong, and start walking around the house, with the woman following me. I don't hear her footsteps, but I know she's right behind me, running her long painted nails down my spine as I walk around, looking for my family.

I find my mother. She's been killed, each time, the same way; blood splattered around the walls of the shower, and her slumped down on the floor. 

I immediately turn around and leave, trying to find my father. The woman knows I know she killed my mother, and I feel myself getting cold, as she tries to convince me that I don't need anyone else. ""You're fine here with me, just turn around, stop, and stay with me... Is your daddy home?""

My dad's dead. I know that, now. I slowly turn around to see the woman, and the second I turn around, I know what's going to happen, but I can't stop myself from looking. The woman is a skinny, grey skinned man with thin lips and the most hateful stare I've ever encountered, and in a deep, terrifying, rumbling voice, he'd always call out a random word as he lunged at me.

11,I took a walk before bed,1300062802,"Restless night, my body suggested there was energy to expend before I could fall asleep.  I threw off my bed sheets; tossed on jeans and a sweater from the floor, and snatched the jacket draped over the desk chair.  Making my way through the basement to the sliding door.  I slipped on a pair of older shoes, and exited quietly.  
	
Moisture hung in the spring air, and a day of rain had vanquished the remaining layer of winter snow.  I made for the orange haze of the streetlight located at the final turn of the dirt country road.  The only home I passed had been left abandoned the previous summer.  Vines encased the brick chimney, siding torn away displaying gaping holes in the structure, windows smashed, but the blinds still drawn.  I reached the turn, also the last source of artificial light.  Moving towards the pathway adjacent to the field. Broken stalks of corn reached from the cultivated soil.
	
The darkness was blinding, but as my eyes adjusted the sloping lane ahead of me was revealed.  I moved forward, observing the long untamed grass, littered with rusted farm equipment and lined by leafless trees, thorns protruding from the trunks. Reaching the peak of the slope I turned to observe the view, abandoned home still visible through the tree line.  
	
A shadow moved, unnaturally in my field of vision, disappearing, perhaps hiding.  I moved towards the disturbance and barely cracked my lips to whisper if someone was there.  Silence.  Closer, closer, needing to know if my terror was justified.  A final step forward and I shot a glance behind the thorny trunk.  Nothing.  Looking towards the house I spotted it, a short dark figure making its way through the knee-high grass of the property.  I swallowed hard, attempted to disregard what I saw, but my eyes were fixated on the mysterious movement.  The figure turned, a boy wrapped in dark ragged clothing, and a cap skewed to the side.  He flashed a grin, and took off running for the condemned house.  
	
Attempting to maintain control of my fear, I willed myself to follow.  Struggling into the grass.  He sensed me trailing and his shape shot across the expanse of land, disappearing into the structure.  Tracking his route, I came across a lone item, a tattered cap, no brand or logo, unique.  Horrified I snatched it up as I hurried home.  A sickness building in my stomach, I did not dare linger near the dilapidated home.
	
I returned to my residence through the sliding door and immediately kicked off my shoes.  Distraught, I made for the bedroom.  Tossed my clothes in a pile upon the floor, and took refuge beneath the sheets.  I went fetal, squeezed my eyes shut, and dreamed of waking up to morning sunlight.

I was startled within hours; a cold sweat encased my body, the temperature of my room dramatically lowered.  I heard movement, a rustling, and forced my eyes to reveal the unknown.  The boy was on hands and knees, his back to me; clothing littered the floor around him.  He reached forward and with tiny fingers grabbed the cap.  I gasped, unable to scream; again he turned, slowly.  Sirens erupted from the street.  He flashed a grin.  I sprung up and raced outside, fearful of his intentions.  Fire crews were extinguishing flames erupting from the disfigured dwelling.  I turned back to my home. Peering from the basement window was a boy, smiling, crooked cap upon his head, flames flickering in his eyes.

12,Why I don't stay in motels,1300052308,"	I remember hearing this story from a friend of mine a few years back, and it's one of    the creepiest non-paranormal things I've heard. It happened to his parents, who swear it to be    true. 



	Apparently, some twenty-odd years ago (before he was born), his mother and father were       staying in a cheap motel room on their way to visit her parents. Their family lives somewhere    out in the podunk of West Texas, so the place they decided to stop en route was small,     isolated, and very quiet. They go to bed relatively early that night, in hopes of rising early to finish    the trip by lunchtime. 



	In the middle of the night, the mother wakes up, somewhat abruptly, and to    total darkness. Her husband is not stirring on the bed next to her. Confused as to what woke her,    she turns to the alarm clock on the table beside her, sees that it’s only 3 or 4 a.m., and rolls to    go back to sleep. It’s pitch black and dead quiet, and as she shuts her eyes, she feels    the surfacing of an intense feeling that someone is watching her. Not just watching, staring. She    finds the courage to roll back over and turn on the lamp, and, to her horror, sees a man,    in the room, at the foot of the bed, looking directly at her. Gun in hand. He looks at her, says, &lt;Sorry,     wrong room,&gt; and turns and walks out. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g3aoa/why_i_dont_stay_in_motels/

16,The Haunted Snowman,1300023809,"Ya I know the title is gay but whatever. Ok this happened when I was about 12 years old and I still will never forget it.  It was Christmas time and my mom had been decorating our house like normal.  Our house was built in like the early 1940s so it was big but pretty old.  I remember she came home from a flea market with some new decorations, one being this wooden hand-carved snowman. The snowman looked creepy to begin with, it was about 2 feet tall and I remember it was holding a broom and didn't even have a smile on its face.  Ya who the hell knows why my mom would buy a christmas snowman that wasnt even smiling and had a broom.  Anyways I remember my mom put the snowman on the corner of our stone fireplace facing outwards toward the living room.  
Ok this is where things got creepy.    A few days passed and each morning this snowman would be facing inwards towards the fireplace.  (Thus making a 180 degree turn).  I remember my parents laughing it off thinking it was me just trying to mess with them.  I insisted to them I had not touched the thing and I didn't know why or how it kept being turned around in the middle of the night.  Soooo about after a week the same circumstances kept happening of the snowman somehow being turned around and no one knew how it was happening.  But the night I will never forget is what I need to explain.  It was late at night and I remember I was the only one awake in my house.  At about 11 pm I walked to the kitchen to get something to drink, I had to walk by the living room and in doing so I looked down at the snowman and saw it was facing outwards, ok no problem.  After getting a drink I started making my way back to my room and as I was walking back I heard a scratching noise coming from the living room.  I looked down at the snowman and it was completely turned around towards the fireplace.  I completely freaked and ran into my room.  I remember I couldn't even move from my bed all night and kept my light on.   The next morning I told my parents what happened and said we are getting rid of the snowman, which we did.  Telling this story still gives me goosebumps.  ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g33f0/the_haunted_snowman/

18,The day my dog turned on me,1299998032,"When I was growing up, I had an older brother who was seven years older than me.  He had a great dog named Murphy, and I used to love to play with her, though nowadays she's not one to play being the ripe old age of 14.  Well sure enough, my mom noticed my interest in the family pet and decided she would take me to the ASPCA to adopt another dog.

It was great being back at the shelter, as we got Murphy there too, and all of the dogs looked so cute and fluffy.  We looked through all the separate rooms where the dogs were, and finally a small beagle caught my eye.  We asked one of the volunteers about the dog, and she didn't seem to know when he got there.  She asked someone else, who told us that the dog had just been brought there by a frail old woman, who said she could no longer care for the dog for unspecified reasons.

""Well this is great!"" my mom said, seeing as how the dog had little time to learn bad behaviors or be brought up in a bad environment.  ""It'll be like getting your very own puppy!""  I of course was ecstatic at the idea of getting my own pup.  And after some paperwork and a few mandatory shots, I had just that.  

A few weeks passed by, and I was getting to know ""brownie"" quite well, as I had named her.  She was a real fast learner, she made training easy.  After only a few weeks, she was well trained enough to start sleeping in my bed.  Every school day was just a wait to get out so I could play with brownie.  Then one day, things just didn't seem right.

I came home to find brownie gnawing at the couch, which would never have happened on a normal day.  I scolded her quickly, to which she looked at me with such a glaring gaze I was taken aback.  I could hear my voice crack as I looked in her dark red eyes, telling her to not bite the couch.  ""BAD BROWNIE!"" I yelled as I went to pick her up to put her in the cage.  As soon as my hands came within reach of her, she snapped at me, leaving two puncture wounds in my palm.  

Being the child I was I started to cry very heavily, and then something happened, something that to this day will never stop giving me the chills.  Brownie actually smiled at me, not just showed her teeth, but the corners of her mouth came up in a smile, and she showed her uncharacteristically sharp teeth to me.  She then lunged at me, grabbing me in the thigh.  I panicked and started smacking her in the head, doing anything I could to shake her grip.  I was spinning around the room, crying and screaming, begging her to let go.  Then all of a sudden, a huge exhalation of air comes from her lungs.  I look down to see her once deep dark red pupils rapidly expand to the entire size of her eye, fade to black, and then, nothing.  No movement, no sound, she just dropped.  I was so panicked I just stood there, blood gushing from the puncture wounds on my thigh.  I picked up brownie and held her in my arms and cried for hours, until my mom finally came home.

We brought her to the vet, and the vet said she'd never seen anything like it before.  An examination of the dog showed no signs of physical trauma, and she said her best guess was that the dog had some kind of neurological disorder which caused its eventual death.

To this day, it's still difficult to talk about the incident with anyone, I'm just glad I could get it off my chest.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g2zkt/the_day_my_dog_turned_on_me/
19,Childhood Dreams,1299993764,"I don't like to consider my dreams as being worthwhile scary stories, but after seeing the interest paid to others I would like to share the one night terror that stands out from my childhood with nosleep.

The year was 1996, and I was eight years old. Myself, my sister, and my Mother lived in a small three bedroom house in sunny California, while my Father was deployed in the Navy. My sister and I sat in the living room, watching our T.V. together on the floor, while our Mother washed clothes in our laundry room. Our house, in an effort to save space, had an attached garage that also contained a small room with our computer and the washer and dryer. It was evening, and the front door was open, with the screen door closed, but not locked. As my sister and I sat watching some unknown cartoon, we heard the voice of our Mom call to us. Confused as to why she would need us to let her in when the door wasn't locked, we stood together and walked towards the screen door, only to see what horror waited for us. There, where our Mother should have been, was a crude machine, an android without well defined limbs, wearing our Mothers flayed flesh over it's own pewter toned body. The torn strips of skin leaked blood and fat over it's simple stick-like arms as it called to my sister and I, in our Mother voice, to open the door for it. It could not open the screen door without fingers, and as my sister and I sobbed, knowing what it meant that this thing stood in front of us, covered in our Mother's flesh, the android attempted to comfort us in our Mom's voice.

20,The face i can never forget,1299990460,I dont remember dreams too much but there have been some that i could never forget. One of them i mean some cuz they were like some series or something i saw when i was like 7 years old. At that time i was too scared to sleep by myself and changing my regular sleep place like from bed to couch. So i remember they were exactly 8 dreams that kept expanding each other like i said series of a tv show. They happened for 2 months cuz i couldnt stop myself from napping on the couch from time to time and it was weird cuz the couch was like some kind of supernatural bed dreams place. They all started with me having a fight with my parents about some toys i think and i ran out of the house (in the dream if u're wondering). I went to the little park near our house that really exists and just stood there in the night. After some time i hear this strange kind of singing from some men. I dont know how to describe it but it sounded like a chainsaw cutting through wood mixed with some if i can say death rock but slow and strange words i couldnt understand. The men came to the park never stopping singing and i ran to the nearest hiding place i could find. It was surprisingly very good and no real person could see me there in the night but they did. It was like they knew all along where i was cuz as i was running and hiding they never stopped walking towards me still singing that strange song. This was the end of the first dream. The other ones kept taking things from the dream before and adding more thing and expanding the story. The second had all the things from the first adding some more the third from the second adding more and so on. Now i cant remember exactly what happened in each dream but im just gonna wrap it up in one. So the men kept going towards me so i was backing away slowly. Strangely a cliff appeared from nowhere and i fell. Strangely more after like 2 minutes of falling (yea it seemed that long) one of the men grabbed me by the throat and we were again in the park. They put me in a bag and carried me away. I was punching and kicking all the time but it was no use. Listening to the strange song i started singing it for myself. I didnt want to but i couldnt stop it. Like my mouth and voice was possessed or something. In the meantime i heard a scream. A scream of a witch that i can never forget cuz it was so loud that i almost passed out. I heard sounds that something was slaughtered but i couldnt tell who the men or the witch or witches. The men stopped singing but i didnt. I wasnt being carried away anymore i was laying on the ground. My throat started to hurt cuz u had to somehow scream but with a low voice and no rhythm. In the end i finally stopped. I couldnt talk anymore. I opened the bag with a knife that came out of nowhere in my pockets and there i saw it. The face i can never forget. The face of the ugliest craziest angriest looking witch of all time coming at me. If only i had a picture to show u how terrifying it was.She tries to grab me and everything goes black. A pain started out of nowhere in my stomach like someone was eating it from inside out. I woke up screaming in the night while my parents try to calm me down and say it was just a bad dream...,nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g2xwu/the_face_i_can_never_forget/

Figured i'd ask the only people I know, that may have ever tried to communicate with the *Other Side*. 
- So the General consensus is that spirits hear in whichever language they choose, and communicate back to us with images and general impressions rather than actual language, making it negligible? Huh... Thanks guys. ",nosleep,DrOPotnic,/r/nosleep/comments/g2v71/are_spirits_multilingual/
23,Creepy dream that left me feeling a little shaken,1299977955,"I'm not sure i'll even finish this self post however I'll do my best.

I had a dream last night that was so .. out of the blue that I can't fathom why I would have dreamt it. You know like if you watch alot of a tv show or go on a walk through the woods or even talk about a scary movie with someone you may have a dream related to some theme of that. Well my dream went down like this..

It's in a movie theatre were myself, my sister, a work manger (who i've never really spoke too) and a whole bunch of random other public people were catching a last showing of the day for some movie which I don't recall. From here on it went very dark, fast. 

As I was walking about into the foyer after the movie was finished I was looking around for my sister. I couldn't see her but she was just behind me, I started panicing and pushing through the crowd to find her. I asked the work manager several times if he had seen my sister and he just shrugged.

I looked in the toilets, back in the screening room, everywhere except a door at the end of the hall. The door looked out of place with it being made out of a dark wood in this modern looking Cineworld. I opened the door gingerly and it led to a room which probably couldn't have existed since the size of it meant that it would have been cutting through the end screening room. 

Inside it was pretty dimly lit, with one of those low light flickering bulbs, with another door further down. I thought to myself she would never have come down here but I went anyway and opened the door. 

It led to a very dirty, grimy bathroom with 5 toilet stalls. As I was about to leave I heard a faint sobbing coming from the middle stall, I stooped down and looked under seeing my sister on the floor kinda sitting with her feet towards the wall as if you would hug the toilet when you are throwing up you know? Just kinda saddling the shape of the loo on the floor and the legs of somebody over her. 

This is the part of the dream I felt intense rage and I kicked open the door and proceeded to beat the overweight man to within an inch of his life. I can't really describe the guy since his features were just a blur however I felt extremely upset and angry that somebody would kidnap and .. I don't want to think about that.

So cut to a short time later, the police are putting cuffs on the man and taking him away and for some reason he talks to a dirty blonde coloured hair man who he identified as his son in the patches of the conversation I could hear. I didn't really make out what was said but after they were finished talking I pushed the son and told him to never come near me or my family or I will break every bone. Which is so out of character for me since I'm against violence.

Cut to 3 years later, i am living in some apartment in a tall building drinking tea looking out the window. It was around this time that I woke up covered in sweat. My heart was slightly racing. 

Thanks for reading, I had to get it off my chest since it's 1 am now and I don't want to go to sleep now and have a repeat of it, the terror of that primal fear is too much to handle.

24,Taking a walk before bed,1299976892,"        Restless night, my body suggested there was energy to expend before I could fall asleep.  I threw off my bed sheets; tossed on jeans and a sweater from the floor, and snatched the jacket draped over the desk chair.  Making my way through the basement to the sliding door.  I slipped on a pair of older shoes, and exited quietly.  
	Moisture hung in the spring air, and a day of rain had vanquished the remaining layer of winter snow.  I made for the orange haze of the streetlight located at the final turn of the dirt country road.  The only home I passed had been left abandoned the previous summer.  Vines encased the brick chimney, siding torn away displaying gaping holes in the structure, windows smashed, but the blinds still drawn.  I reached the turn, also the last source of artificial light.  Moving towards the pathway adjacent to the field. Broken stalks of corn reached from the cultivated soil.
	The darkness was blinding, but as my eyes adjusted the sloping lane ahead of me was revealed.  I moved forward, observing the long untamed grass, littered with rusted farm equipment and lined by leafless trees, thorns protruding from the trunks. Reaching the peak of the slope I turned to observe the view, abandoned home still visible through the tree line.  
	A shadow moved, unnaturally in my field of vision, disappearing, perhaps hiding.  I moved towards the disturbance and barely cracked my lips to whisper if someone was there.  Silence.  Closer, closer, needing to know if my terror was justified.  A final step forward and I shot a glance behind the thorny trunk.  Nothing.  Looking towards the house I spotted it, a short dark figure making its way through the knee-high grass of the property.  I swallowed hard, attempted to disregard what I saw, but my eyes were fixated on the mysterious movement.  The figure turned, a boy wrapped in dark ragged clothing, and a cap skewed to the side.  He flashed a grin, and took off running for the condemned house.  
	Attempting to maintain control of my fear, I willed myself to follow.  Struggling into the grass.  He sensed me trailing and his shape shot across the expanse of land, disappearing into the structure.  Tracking his route, I came across a lone item, a tattered cap, no brand or logo, unique.  Horrified I snatched it up as I hurried home.  A sickness building in my stomach, I did not dare linger near the dilapidated home.
	I returned to my residence through the sliding door and immediately kicked off my shoes.  Distraught, I made for the bedroom.  Tossed my clothes in a pile upon the floor, and took refuge beneath the sheets.  I went fetal, squeezed my eyes shut, and dreamed of waking up to morning sunlight.
I was startled within hours; a cold sweat encased my body, the temperature of my room dramatically lowered.  I heard movement, a rustling, and forced my eyes to reveal the unknown.  The boy was on hands and knees, his back to me; clothing littered the floor around him.  He reached forward and with tiny fingers grabbed the cap.  I gasped, unable to scream; again he turned, slowly.  Sirens erupted from the street.  He flashed a grin.  I sprung up and raced outside, fearful of his intentions.  Fire crews were extinguishing flames erupting from the disfigured dwelling.  I turned back to my home. Peering from the basement window was a boy, smiling, crooked cap upon his head, flames flickering in his eyes.

26,Recent Hotel Experience,1299972433,"I want to share a recent experience with you.  No twist ending (unless you weren't paying attention), no dramatic set-up (aside from the necessary backstory) - just a step-by-step account of something unsettling that happened a few days ago.


For the past few weeks, I spent a good chunk of time living in a hotel room due to an extended business trip.  There were a handful of us, and a coworker and I ended up rooming right next to each other.  Our headboards shared a wall, so we would periodically get each other’s attention by knocking on said wall.  A knock or two to signal we were heading down to the lobby to meet for dinner, or to let the other person know we were heading to the office.  Just silly stuff, really.


Fast forward to last Thursday.  We’re all slated to check out of the hotel on Friday morning to catch a flight that afternoon.  My coworker, however, decided to stick around and stay with a friend for the weekend and arranged to catch a flight on Sunday.  On Thursday night, she checked out around 8:00 PM and I drove her and her belongings to her friend’s house and we said goodbye and happy trails and all that jazz.


I get back to the hotel, switch my phone to “airplane mode” (I use my phone as an alarm and I don’t like getting woken up at 1:00 AM by Groupon and LivingSocial emails), and pass out.  At around 4:30 AM I’m woken up by four or five firm knocks on my headboard wall.  I’m groggy as shit, so I basically fire back with a [“shave-and-a-haircut”](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/76/Shave_and_a_Haircut_in_C.mid ""Just a midi for those of you who aren't familiar with the name of this tune."") series of knocks without thinking.  After a second or two, I hear the finishing two knocks from the other side of the wall.  I figured my coworker was trying to get my attention because she must have sent me a text or called and left me a message.  I switch my phone back to “normal” mode and wait for the message to display or a voicemail to pop up.


No new messages or texts.  I decided to send her a message to ask her what’s up, and I got halfway through typing it before I realized what I should have known right away: she wasn’t even in that room on the other side of the wall anymore; she had checked out earlier that evening.


I’ve never really felt creeped out in a hotel before.  You’re surrounded by a bunch of other people, so I just always felt kind of safe...  but this shook me up a bit.

27,So I hear this is the place to post about creepy dreams.,1299951958,"I'm one of those people that only rarely remembers their dreams. But when I do, they tend to be quite vivid.

When I was about 15, I went on a mission trip to Appalachia with my church youth group. We were all piled into a school bus, and the drive lasted at least a day and a half, so we had to stop and sleep overnight at other churches. 

On the trip there, we got lost on the back roads of Ohio trying to find the place we were supposed to sleep that night. 

It was about 1 or two in the morning (yeah, we were REALLY lost) and looking out the window, I must have drifted off – except the transition was so seamless I don't remember actually falling asleep. Because one moment I was just looking out the window at the dark countryside, and the next there were all these pale, flickering people walking through the trees on either side of the road, just watching us. They were all white, and seemed almost luminous as they came closer to the road.

 I looked around, and everybody else on the bus was asleep, except the driver.

The driver was this kinda stoic, old-school renfest goth guy named Christopher (NOT Chris), and he and I got each other pretty well, so I'd been sitting up front to shoot the shit with him. I remember turning around to ask him what was up with the people on the side of the road, but he was just staring straight ahead. He didn't seem freaked out or anything, but before I could actually say anything, he said, in this really calm voice: 

""Don't say anything. Don't look at them. You need to be asleep.""

I didn't think the people from the road wanted to hurt me – if anything, I just felt sad for them. They all looked so lost, and their clothes were all in tatters. Some of them looked like they'd been burned. Some of them were kids.

But I believed Christopher when he told me it was better not to look at them.

I don't remember going to sleep, but I did close my eyes, and when I opened them again we were in a small town, and the road-people were gone.",nosleep,fusionblonde,/r/nosleep/comments/g2o1o/so_i_hear_this_is_the_place_to_post_about_creepy/

29,I'll never sleep there again,1299944505,"I hesitate to commit this story to words because I feel that once I write it I can no longer deny it in my head.

What is it that tells the hairs on the back of your neck to stand on end?

A couple of years ago I was at my aunt and uncle’s house in rural Massachusetts. They live in a farm-style house on a sizeable plot of land for their two horses. They also have two enormous dogs. 

We ate dinner and talked and played cards until pretty late. Soon after my uncle turned in for the night, my aunt insisted that I stay over because it was a long drive back to my house. With no plans the next day I obliged and tucked myself into the guestroom. The room was pitch black as I climbed into bed. It was unbelievably quiet.

As soon as I closed my eyes I began to feel a sensation. At first it was a warm feeling in my neck and shoulders. This was followed by goose bumps on my neck and a very slight ringing in my ears.  

The best way I can convey what happened next is to start by describing how I suddenly and inexplicably felt very vulnerable. This was very odd to me because vulnerability is usually coupled with a threat of some sort. I did not feel a threat at that moment, but it was as if I could sense that a threat was swiftly coming. I sensed this as clear as hearing a train whistle at a railroad crossing, even though the train is not yet within sight. 

Then came the hard evidence. It started as a low tapping sound to my right. I tried desperately to somehow “not acknowledge” the sound but the more I tried the louder it got. I couldn’t figure out exactly what was producing the tapping sound, or from where. I felt sure that the sound was not coming from a source suspended in air, but was coming from the wall next to me. 

My first thought – “heating pipes”. But this was in the summer and it was moderately warm outside. As soon as my brain had discounted the possibility of the tapping originating from an old piping system, the sound got louder.

Also, the cadence of the sound had now changed. What had started as a mechanical, constant tap-tap-tap-tap-tap had now become a pattern-less rhythm of taps. Then I felt a sensation that I can only describe as my body looking at something. Even though my eyes were closed I knew something was looking directly at me. 

I did not take an audible breath even after the tapping stopped. I didn’t want show that I was alive. I eventually fell asleep.

A couple of weeks later I decided to tell my uncle what had happened. He is a very reserved, down to earth sort of person and I figured he would laugh my story off as ridiculous. Instead, he looked me in the eye and sat up straight as I began telling what had happened. As I began to describe the “sensation” surrounding me that night, he suddenly cut me off as asked where I thought the tapping had come from. I was confused because I had not yet gotten to the part about the tapping. 

I told him that the only logical thing could be that the tapping sound was coming from the heating pipes in the wall next to my bed. He said that wasn’t possible because there are no pipes or vents there. He said that on the other side of that wall is the closet to the master bedroom.

Then he said that he needed to confide in me about something he hadn’t told my aunt. 

He said that one time he came in from the yard and heard the dogs “snarling and growling from the bedroom.” As he got closer to the door he heard them jumping up and down the same way they would react to a predator. He opened the door to the master bedroom and saw that they were looking towards the closet.

31,Congregation,1299915265,"An overwhelming smell of gasoline is engorging itself upon my nose. Everything is black. Why is it black? I try to reach out to feel my eyes. Nothing. Where are my eyes? Why the fuck can't I feel my eyes!? Could I ever feel my eyes to even begin with? I can't be blind. I can't be blind. I can't be blind. I still can't feel them. I open my mouth to scream. Nothing. I start to drown.  A burning fleet rides the flame deluge down my throat, an ocean of fire encapsulates me. Every scream breaks the thread holding back the second floor. I start clawing at my lungs to get it out, my own vivid vivisection performed with worn down fingernails. Everything is turning to a acrimonious haze. I start to slip.

You know when you turn on a t.v. and it struggles to find that station for a split second. Everything is out of focus and far away? That's what I feel like. Right now, I am this static embodiment. I lay my hand next to my face. I can feel the cool ice under my fingertips. I just can't actually feel it per se. I can remember what that feeling is. I wish I knew what this feeling is. I don't even know what this feeling is. Two bright lights in the distance seem to be dancing together, it's very pretty. I wish I were as happy as those lights, dancing together, forever and ever and ever....

A soft, eloquent hand runs through my hair. Her mellifluous lips glide across mine as she presses up against me. I miss her touch. I miss her smell. I miss her. I don't know what ever happened. I'm starting to cry. If only it worked out differently. The pools at my feet drag me down. “No!” I scream. I grab onto her. A fading memory is difficult to grasp. “No, not again” I plead. My hands slip through her as an ocean of static noise drags me to her lonely depths.

Lights of red and blue dance portentously across my eyes. Shadowy men in the distance are moving  towards me. I cannot make them out. I try to squint but something is dripping across my eyes. “Ow, fuck, my head”. Crimson glass lays scattered all around. I try and move but I can't. The glass starts to float down the hill to the left. I didn't rain today did it? No, this water smells funny. I know this smell. Burnt rubber? Yes, that's what it is. It has to be. Wait no. My hand starts to shake. Why is it shaking? I look at it and it's resting on a metal tube or something embedded in the ground. Phew, that was lucky, it's the metal that's shaking, not me. I hear shouts in the distance but can't really make out what they are saying. My own congregation coming to gather round I think. I hope they can tell me what's happened. Two lights in the distance are followed by the screech of metal on metal and a deafening air raid siren. The lights make a sharp right straight for me. They came up fast. I still can't move. I scream. My congregation never made it.

33,still gives me chills,1299909928,"I cannot say this story actually happen to me, but it did happen to a friend of mine’s parents.  And it’s also the one ghost story that still gives me chills.
My friend’s parents had recently gotten engaged and were in the process of planning their wedding.  They lived near the church they were getting married in which was convenient because they ended up spending quite a bit of time there.  Their apartment building was connected to a cemetery directly across from the church.  There was one straight path that ran from one side to the other connecting the apartments and the church.  Lisa and Jim walked the path multiple times a week to and from the church because it was the most efficient way and for the most part it was a very peaceful cemetery.
One particular night they were leaving the church around 10, it was close to the wedding so they had stayed later, and like always they decided to walk the cemetery path home because it was pretty warm outside.  They get about half way down the path when Jim notices that his wallet has somehow fallen out of his pocket.  He tells Lisa that it has fallen out of his pocket or maybe he had forgotten it at the church. Either way they were going to have to retrace their steps and go back.  They get about a quarter of the way back when Jim spots the wallet placed on top of an unmarked gravestone maybe twenty feet from the path.  They both thought it was odd that they found it there but decided to think nothing of it.  So Jim walks over to pick up the wallet and the moment his hand touches it his whole demeanor changes.  Now Jim is a pretty outgoing guy he’s loud and happy and always keeps talking.  After he picked up the wallet his posture changed, he became slumped and appeared tired.  He also stopped talking entirely.  Lisa thought it was odd but she figured it spooked him finding the wallet there so she let it go until they got to their apartment.
As they returned home Jim went immediately upstairs to the bedroom leaving Lisa to lock up and turn off the lights.  When she finally went to bed she found Jim sitting it a wooden desk chair directly in front of the window overlooking the cemetery.  He was just staring intently not acknowledging Lisa at all as she came in.  Lisa tried talking to him but he wouldn’t respond so she started to get frustrated and just got ready for bed instead.  When she got into bed she asked him to come to bed with her, he finally responded by saying, “I can’t.  I have to make sure they can’t get in through the windows.”  At this statement Lisa got pissed.  She confronted him telling him to cut it out and they he was really scaring her.  He just continued to insist that he has to protect them from what was out there and that he had to stay by the window. 
The next morning Lisa woke up to find Jim asleep next to her.  She immediately woke him up yelling at him for being a jerk for scaring her.  Jim just seemed confused.  He insisted that all they had done was go to the church, walk home, and go to bed.  He didn’t remember losing his wallet or anything after.  To this day Jim won’t speak about the event.

34,A gun is serious business!,1299909149,"A gun is no joke. No matter how small the caliber, that charge let loose by burning black powder like a rocket engine sending a steel slug into the body of another living creature is not as Hollywood might have you believe, not at all.

For starters, a gun is loud, real loud! It's loud enough to damage hearing permanently after the first shot. The percussion it lets off is debilitating in nature. Your eyes close at the blast and your hearing rings at the report. You always have a natural urge to stick a finger in your ear canal and attempt to fight off the numbing effects of such an intense sound. So as you can imagine, when a bullet strikes a human, it's pure evil.

There's not much else in this world scarier than seeing the corpse of a human riddled by a .357 magnum, it's atrocious.

The entry wound is nothing but a mere hole, tiny, the size of a pen, it's the exit wound that causes jaws to drop, and when you're standing over a corpse in an abandoned car lot somewhere in middle Atlanta around 12am, it's a horrifying sight.

I realized that who ever had gunned down the once lively human I was looking at, meant for them to die... forever. They'd been shot in the trunk more than once and the exit wounds had taken chunks out as large as a dictionary.

Pieces had flown all over the cracked pavement, blood splattered the surrounding area and flies came and went as if they were waiting for me to leave before they could lay their larvae and feast. ""Leave us alone for god sake!"" they seemed to tell me.

The body lay there, face in the pavement, silent, lonely, a story to tell I am sure. Here I was, though, scared, silent, paranoid of the armed specter lurking in the small patch of woods nearby. My only company was the constant buzzing of street lamps which barely illuminated the entire scene.

I looked about with caution, pulled my camera from around my neck, took a few pictures, stared to the boarded up auto shop nearby, and left.

The train ride home was an odd one. I was becoming all the things I'd feared, a monster. Urban exploration was great, but it was witnessing instances like that which made me crazy, which made my eyes more and more narrow as I fought back tears. I was turning into a monster, and I still am.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g2g2x/a_gun_is_serious_business/

“Red sky at night, slayer’s delight,” he sang to himself as he bounded up the five steps to his door.  Unlocking the handle and two deadbolts, he stepped inside and closed the door with a firm push, which squeezed with a moan into its confining dimensions.  It had never been quite right.  Hanging his windbreaker on the back of a chair, he began to contemplate his plans for the evening.

Snatching a Red Bull from the refrigerator, he wondered how long it would take to get to her house.  She lived up in the Heights.  He had the address written down and gauging the distance in his head, he decided that he didn’t feel like walking.  It had been a long, tiring day at the bank – huge influx of deposits – which was how he had met her.

She was the type he liked: smart, unfetterable, of good upbringing, and healthy.  She had strawberry blonde hair, rosy cheeks, plump, succulent lips, and had been wearing the most precious little heart in her hair.  He had attempted to strike up a conversation, but she had answered sparingly and was careful of her words.  Careful, expectant, challenging.  Good.

Her forms had been all he needed.  Place of residence, health status, name, occupation; all perfect.  He was excited about this one.  So, he was taking even more care and deliberation with her than the others.  This was to be the epitome of his accomplishments and there was no room for errors.  Not that he ever made them.

So, he drove his little scarlet Ford Taurus to her street, parked in a garage, walked up the street to her house, and just took it all in.  Side street, separated from the next house by about ten feet, red brick, high windows, and one car in the driveway.  Exemplary.

Not one person noticed him pacing through the circular pools of light along the otherwise dark street.  He was naturally inconspicuous, escaping notice effortlessly.  A blessing really; it made his work easier.

After a few hours of this, he returned to his apartment to plan.  He plotted until he was satisfied with his work and could hold his heavy eyelids open no longer.  He then slid under his covers and dreamt of the promise in tomorrow night.

The day seemed to drag on forever.  Not many contributors, just labeling, storing, and paperwork.  Not that he did not enjoy it, but all of this was inferior to what he would be seeing tonight.  The seconds moved too slowly to count.

Finally, it was quitting time.  He practically skipped home and retrieved his supplies.  After a quick dinner of tomato soup and sandwiches, he left for the Heights.

It was odd.  Every time the anticipation for a night like this began to build, he found his hair raising, his nostrils flaring, his heart rate skyrocketing, and his vision, well, it changed.  He could smell everything;  the polyester steering wheel, the hot cd in the player, and even the fuzzy dice on his rearview mirror.  He saw the world in contrasts, almost infrared.  Everything of importance blazed – every movement, everything that made a sound – in a more distinct red than usual.

Now he was walking down the street to her house.  He was carrying his tote bag of “goodies,” as he called them, on his left shoulder, and flexing his right hand.  Open, shut, open, shut, open, shut.  Rhythmic and predictable as almost everything in life is.  Footsteps, breaths, habits, eating, sleeping, heartbeats, and the pumping of blood through veins.  But life hadn’t considered his influence.

He relaxed his hand and let his mind go to work.  As soon as he was within fifty yards of the house, he transformed into a master tactician, holding his bag so that it didn’t jingle, keeping a relaxed and friendly look on his face, looking around nonchalantly, and acting as if nothing was going to happen.  While all of this was going on, he surveyed the house.  He knew what he was going to do, but how to do it without being seen?  Not a problem; he was invisible.

He slipped up the drive, moving to the left side of the garage and melted into the shadows.  Why take any chances?  He put down his bag and quickly mastered the locking mechanism of the garage window and swung it inward.   Tying a rope to his bag, he let it slowly down to the floor and then pulled himself through using the gutter drainpipe just above the opening.  All those pull ups and sit ups were finally coming in handy.

His eyes didn’t need to adjust, so he moved across the garage past the car and odd assortment of junk to the door on the other side.  So far so good.  He crouched to peer under, and when he saw no movement he put on his lucky glove and hoisted his gleaming companion with fond familiarity.  He was ready.

Leaving his bag, he slowly opened the door and slunk inside.  The place smelled of potpourri, health food, and . . . . dog.  Not good.  Maybe he would have to rethink his scheme. But no!  He had waited far too long to let such a minor obstacle stop him.

He crept through the darkened kitchen and listened for any signs of life.  Only the soft humming of the refrigerator and the ticking of a clock.  So he glided into the living room.  No signs of life there either, human or canine.  Only plush couches and pictures of family and friends hung by the television.  

Suddenly, his vision flared and his nasal passages seared: the dog.  Turning quickly, he took one step and with a firm sweeping motion, silenced the creature.  Inferior, disgusting, and horrid blood seeped into the carpet.  He hated the different shade of red, the viscosity, the way it spurt from the neck: infernal.  Nothing like human. 

But he could not dwell on this, the dog had let out a single gruff bark before it had been taken care of.  How annoying.  So now he had to change his tactic.  He could already hear the soft padding of footsteps upstairs.  Slow, precise, inquisitive, and careful.  She was alert, good.  He liked a little feist.

No time to wait, he had to rush now.  Stupid pestilence of a dog.  Hurrying down the hall, he grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped his companion free of filth.  No sense in tainting such a perfect specimen.  Despite the burning in his throat from nearly retching at the sight of the revolting dog, he found that he was still enthralled.  It was still blood, it was still what he craved, what he loved, even though it was inferior.  His own began to boil, and his vision sharpened.  He was smiling.  This was it, finally, after all the anticipation, it was time.  
Poking his head out of the doorway, he listened intently.  She had not come down the stairs yet.  She seemed to be waiting, waiting for him.  But he was more patient.  He could wait until her curiosity was too great to ignore.  

Five minutes, ten minutes, twenty, and still she did not move.  How curious.  She had exceeded his already high expectations.  Now he could barely wait.

Through those long minutes which seemed more like days, he began to imagine it.  Her blood.  The warm, sticky constituent of the body which kept life going.  That most precious of liquids that had to be spilled to satisfy his needs.  It was all he thought about; it was why he saw the world in red, why he loved to work at the bank, why he was so interested in the body.  Every function relied on it.  Moving, thinking, breathing, speaking, seeing, sex, and all the others.  It was his life, both figuratively and literally.  His life was built upon blood.

He looked into a mirror on the wall and thought back to his childhood.  To this day, he was as quiet, fastidious, and in love with blood as he had been all those years ago.  The playground had started it.  Skin cells lacerated from the body, allowing that sweet liquid of life to pour.  He watched the fights, watched the falls, watched the dares gone wrong, and loved every second.  He had picked at scabs and had always sucked on his finger when he cut it, which had happened far more often than for a usual child.  What a taste!  Warm, sticky, salty, and with that strong iron kick.  He could never bleed enough to sate his longing for it.

As he grew older, he realized that all he lived for was blood.  He would die for blood and so consequently, he would kill for it.  His first time had been at the age of sixteen.  It had been messy and terrifying: it had been perfect.  From then on, he knew that he would have to kill for the rest of his life.  No more watching gory movies.  They were so artificial, the blood wasn’t real.  And besides, he wasn’t actually there, so the experience was pointless to him.

All blood was not equal, though.  Some was oxygen deficient, some had low iron content, some was just too watery.  He hated inferior blood.  But when he found a young, healthy, strong, and well-filled individual, he was never disappointed.  His work at the bank was convenient for this, and was where he found most of his specimens.

He looked for those of good upbringing.  The ones who lived in the nice part of town, who were involved in charity, who went to church.  Pure blood, not tainted by greed or malice or vanity.  He honored these individuals with a special care and tact.  

He was always quick and merciful in his spilling of gallons and gallons of blood.   His preferred method was to use his trusty companion, his sword, or fragmenting shot, or whatever would spill maximum amounts of blood with the least pain to the victim.  Poison would not do, it could taint the hemoglobin, distort the red blood cells, destroy platelets and proteins; no, no poison.

Spilling blood was even more rewarding when he found the most rare of types: AB-.  Now, A, B, and O were fine, and they curbed his craving, but AB-, that was different.  It was like winning the jackpot instead of the daily drawing – bigger, better, more satisfying.  Every time he found an AB-, he reveled in the kill much more than usual.  His nerves tingled, his mind screamed with delight and his hands shook with pleasure.  That was why he was so excited about her, she had AB- coursing through her veins, and he wanted it.

Finally, after what seemed like a millennium, he heard her padding down the stairs.  She moved with deliberation and care.  She was ready, and so was he.  

As he lurked in the shadows, he could barely contain his excitement.  He wanted to see the blood pour from her mouth, to seep from her eyes, to fly into the air and onto the walls, to flow into her hair, and to rush onto his hands.  As she stepped down from the last step, he jerked  unwittingly with anticipation, making the slightest of sounds, and leapt toward her.  With that jerk, she had become aware of his position, and she swung the pistol faster than he swung his blade.

The world seared with a different kind of red.  The companion fell, and so did the wielder.  The would-be-killer writhed and shook with not only pain, but sheer hate of itself.  No mistakes it had promised, no screw ups, everything was to be perfect, no room for error . . . .  It never made mistakes, it never missed, it never failed.  Never.

But now, its blood soaked into its garments, the carpet, the world.  Its mouth and eyes were filling with the inferior liquid.  The blood burned, it tore, it rent.  It clawed at its chest, tore at its eyes, and ripped at its hair.  Burning with hatred and grief.  In agony from contact with such an impure sample, with inferior blood.

There was nothing it could do.  It was slowly drowning in the abhorrent liquid; its breathing slowed, its vision began to fade.  All it could see was the walls seeping its blood, the things it had once thought were hands, and the epitome of specimens standing over it at the ready to fully reverse the roles of this night.


The world darkened into black and white, the pain began to subside, and the blood began to cool.  No longer was the front-page murderer at large.  No longer did the “Monstrosity of the City” roam the streets.  No more was the thirstiest of creatures.  No more.


Frozen figures peer upon the gory scene as blanch and slack-jawed as the cadaver, wondering whether the chalk outlines the body of a man, or what they’ll call it in the papers.

37,Wanted to post in creepy as this is the place I can share this story. ,1299903065,"Few years ago, married to my first wife, I was staying in my mother's house while on military leave from Korea. It was late at night, we were lying there talking when she needed to use the restroom. It is pitch black dark in the house. No one home but us.  I get the bright idea to scare her once she finishes. Bathroom is in the master bedroom along the backside of the house, where my room is at the front. So I am waiting there, and waiting and waiting and she is still in there. I give up and retun to my room. Finally I hear footsteps on the carpet in the hallway, notifying me she is coming. You know the sound, when its so quiet you can hear a pin drop. Steps get closer and closer until I hear her come in the room. I close my eyes and pretend I am asleep and the footsteps stop beside me on my side of the bed. Then nothing. I don't hear her climb into bed or make  a word, just silence. I was about to reach out to her when I hear a toilet flush and a bathroom door open. Immediately I flip the hell out and jump out of bed and run to her. Yea, embarrassing. I tried for years to debunk it. Maybe she knew my plan and tried to scare me but not possible to be so close then flush a toilet and open a door on the other side of the house.

Lots of other stuff happened strangely in that house to my brother and sister but we wouldn't tell each other till YEARS later. If reddit wants I can tell you there stories. 

 That house has been the setting for many of my dreams, even now, and there was just too many coincidences to count about that house and my family. My brother's longtime on-again-off-again girlfriend was the niece of the last tenants. 

She would go on to tell me her aunt had told her a story a little boy died there. She always felt his prescence. One of my brothers experiences has a little boy in it.

39,Darkly the Dreams,1299902598,"‎""It has been hypothesized by certain men, some said experts and prophets of history and all matters human and anthropologic, that as a populaton grows, so too does a strange and horrible construct, an construct entirely unknown, but somehow felt in the dark recesses of imagination in those sensitive to such peculiar natures.

It is within this construct, some perverse offspring birthed unwittingly by the peoples of those vast and dense urbane centers, that the heart of a city beats.

In the warm glow of the sun the heart is deaf, closed to the noise of the dwellers and rabble, yet it is at night the dreams slip through. It dreams the laughter of dead gods and the words of hell-borne kings, of those great hushed barren vistas before the city ever was. 

At night the city dreams, and darkly are the dreams reflected upon her surface.""",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g2eex/darkly_the_dreams/

Not one person noticed him pacing through the circular pools of light along the otherwise dark street.  He was naturally inconspicuous, escaping notice effortlessly.  A blessing really; it made his work easier.
After a few hours of this, he returned to his apartment to plan.  He plotted until he was satisfied with his work and could hold his heavy eyelids open no longer.  He then slid under his covers and dreamt of the promise in tomorrow night.
The day seemed to drag on forever.  Not many contributors, just labeling, storing, and paperwork.  Not that he did not enjoy it, but all of this was inferior to what he would be seeing tonight.  The seconds moved too slowly to count.
Finally, it was quitting time.  He practically skipped home and retrieved his supplies.  After a quick dinner of tomato soup and sandwiches, he left for the Heights.
It was odd.  Every time the anticipation for a night like this began to build, he found his hair raising, his nostrils flaring, his heart rate skyrocketing, and his vision, well, it changed.  He could smell everything;  the polyester steering wheel, the hot cd in the player, and even the fuzzy dice on his rearview mirror.  He saw the world in contrasts, almost infrared.  Everything of importance blazed – every movement, everything that made a sound – in a more distinct red than usual.
Now he was walking down the street to her house.  He was carrying his tote bag of “goodies,” as he called them, on his left shoulder, and flexing his right hand.  Open, shut, open, shut, open, shut.  Rhythmic and predictable as almost everything in life is.  Footsteps, breaths, habits, eating, sleeping, heartbeats, and the pumping of blood through veins.  But life hadn’t considered his influence.
He relaxed his hand and let his mind go to work.  As soon as he was within fifty yards of the house, he transformed into a master tactician, holding his bag so that it didn’t jingle, keeping a relaxed and friendly look on his face, looking around nonchalantly, and acting as if nothing was going to happen.  While all of this was going on, he surveyed the house.  He knew what he was going to do, but how to do it without being seen?  Not a problem; he was invisible.
He slipped up the drive, moving to the left side of the garage and melted into the shadows.  Why take any chances?  He put down his bag and quickly mastered the locking mechanism of the garage window and swung it inward.   Tying a rope to his bag, he let it slowly down to the floor and then pulled himself through using the gutter drainpipe just above the opening.  All those pull ups and sit ups were finally coming in handy.
His eyes didn’t need to adjust, so he moved across the garage past the car and odd assortment of junk to the door on the other side.  So far so good.  He crouched to peer under, and when he saw no movement he put on his lucky glove and hoisted his gleaming companion with fond familiarity.  He was ready.
Leaving his bag, he slowly opened the door and slunk inside.  The place smelled of potpourri, health food, and . . . . dog.  Not good.  Maybe he would have to rethink his scheme. But no!  He had waited far too long to let such a minor obstacle stop him.
He crept through the darkened kitchen and listened for any signs of life.  Only the soft humming of the refrigerator and the ticking of a clock.  So he glided into the living room.  No signs of life there either, human or canine.  Only plush couches and pictures of family and friends hung by the television.  
Suddenly, his vision flared and his nasal passages seared: the dog.  Turning quickly, he took one step and with a firm sweeping motion, silenced the creature.  Inferior, disgusting, and horrid blood seeped into the carpet.  He hated the different shade of red, the viscosity, the way it spurt from the neck: infernal.  Nothing like human. 
But he could not dwell on this, the dog had let out a single gruff bark before it had been taken care of.  How annoying.  So now he had to change his tactic.  He could already hear the soft padding of footsteps upstairs.  Slow, precise, inquisitive, and careful.  She was alert, good.  He liked a little feist.
No time to wait, he had to rush now.  Stupid pestilence of a dog.  Hurrying down the hall, he grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped his companion free of filth.  No sense in tainting such a perfect specimen.  Despite the burning in his throat from nearly retching at the sight of the revolting dog, he found that he was still enthralled.  It was still blood, it was still what he craved, what he loved, even though it was inferior.  His own began to boil, and his vision sharpened.  He was smiling.  This was it, finally, after all the anticipation, it was time.  	Poking his head out of the doorway, he listened intently.  She had not come down the stairs yet.  She seemed to be waiting, waiting for him.  But he was more patient.  He could wait until her curiosity was too great to ignore.  
Five minutes, ten minutes, twenty, and still she did not move.  How curious.  She had exceeded his already high expectations.  Now he could barely wait.
Through those long minutes which seemed more like days, he began to imagine it.  Her blood.  The warm, sticky constituent of the body which kept life going.  That most precious of liquids that had to be spilled to satisfy his needs.  It was all he thought about; it was why he saw the world in red, why he loved to work at the bank, why he was so interested in the body.  Every function relied on it.  Moving, thinking, breathing, speaking, seeing, sex, and all the others.  It was his life, both figuratively and literally.  His life was built upon blood.
He looked into a mirror on the wall and thought back to his childhood.  To this day, he was as quiet, fastidious, and in love with blood as he had been all those years ago.  The playground had started it.  Skin cells lacerated from the body, allowing that sweet liquid of life to pour.  He watched the fights, watched the falls, watched the dares gone wrong, and loved every second.  He had picked at scabs and had always sucked on his finger when he cut it, which had happened far more often than for a usual child.  What a taste!  Warm, sticky, salty, and with that strong iron kick.  He could never bleed enough to sate his longing for it.
As he grew older, he realized that all he lived for was blood.  He would die for blood and 
so consequently, he would kill for it.  His first time had been at the age of sixteen.  It had been messy and terrifying: it had been perfect.  From then on, he knew that he would have to kill for the rest of his life.  No more watching gory movies.  They were so artificial, the blood wasn’t real.  And besides, he wasn’t actually there, so the experience was pointless to him.
All blood was not equal, though.  Some was oxygen deficient, some had low iron content, some was just too watery.  He hated inferior blood.  But when he found a young, healthy, strong, and well-filled individual, he was never disappointed.  His work at the bank was convenient for this, and was where he found most of his specimens.
He looked for those of good upbringing.  The ones who lived in the nice part of town, who were involved in charity, who went to church.  Pure blood, not tainted by greed or malice or vanity.  He honored these individuals with a special care and tact.  
He was always quick and merciful in his spilling of gallons and gallons of blood.   His preferred method was to use his trusty companion, his sword, or fragmenting shot, or whatever would spill maximum amounts of blood with the least pain to the victim.  Poison would not do, it could taint the hemoglobin, distort the red blood cells, destroy platelets and proteins; no, no poison.
Spilling blood was even more rewarding when he found the most rare of types: AB-.  Now, A, B, and O were fine, and they curbed his craving, but AB-, that was different.  It was like winning the jackpot instead of the daily drawing – bigger, better, more satisfying.  Every time he found an AB-, he reveled in the kill much more than usual.  His nerves tingled, his mind screamed with delight and his hands shook with pleasure.  That was why he was so excited about her, she had AB- coursing through her veins, and he wanted it.
Finally, after what seemed like a millennium, he heard her padding down the stairs.  She moved with deliberation and care.  She was ready, and so was he.  
As he lurked in the shadows, he could barely contain his excitement.  He wanted to see the blood pour from her mouth, to seep from her eyes, to fly into the air and onto the walls, to flow into her hair, and to rush onto his hands.  As she stepped down from the last step, he jerked  unwittingly with anticipation, making the slightest of sounds, and leapt toward her.  With that jerk, she had become aware of his position, and she swung the pistol faster than he swung his blade.
The world seared with a different kind of red.  The companion fell, and so did the wielder.  The would-be-killer writhed and shook with not only pain, but sheer hate of itself.  No mistakes it had promised, no screw ups, everything was to be perfect, no room for error . . . .  It never made mistakes, it never missed, it never failed.  Never.
But now, its blood soaked into its garments, the carpet, the world.  Its mouth and eyes were filling with the inferior liquid.  The blood burned, it tore, it rent.  It clawed at its chest, tore at its eyes, and ripped at its hair.  Burning with hatred and grief.  In agony from contact with such an impure sample, with inferior blood.
There was nothing it could do.  It was slowly drowning in the abhorrent liquid; its breathing slowed, its vision began to fade.  All it could see was the walls seeping its blood, the things it had once thought were hands, and the epitome of specimens standing over it at the ready to fully reverse the roles of this night.

The world darkened into black and white, the pain began to subside, and the blood began to cool.  No longer was the front-page murderer at large.  No longer did the “Monstrosity of the City” roam the streets.  No more was the thirstiest of creatures.  No more.

Frozen figures peer upon the gory scene as blanch and slack-jawed as the cadaver, wondering whether the chalk outlines the body of a man, or what they’ll call it in the papers.

41,Spill,1299901161,"I know this isn't that ""keep you up at night"", but it is a bit freaky, and I hope you might be a little unsettled.  I guess I'm more interested in telling a good story here, but give me some feedback on my writing and how I could better portray this event.


“Red sky at night, slayer’s delight,” he sang to himself as he bounded up the five steps to his door.  Unlocking the handle and two deadbolts, he stepped inside and closed the door with a firm push, which squeezed with a moan into its confining dimensions.  It had never been quite right.  Hanging his windbreaker on the back of a chair, he began to contemplate his plans for the evening.
	Snatching a Red Bull from the refrigerator, he wondered how long it would take to get to her house.  She lived up in the Heights.  He had the address written down and gauging the distance in his head, he decided that he didn’t feel like walking.  It had been a long, tiring day at the bank – huge influx of deposits – which was how he had met her.
	She was the type he liked: smart, unfetterable, of good upbringing, and healthy.  She had strawberry blonde hair, rosy cheeks, plump, succulent lips, and had been wearing the most precious little heart in her hair.  He had attempted to strike up a conversation, but she had answered sparingly and was careful of her words.  Careful, expectant, challenging.  Good.
	Her forms had been all he needed.  Place of residence, health status, name, occupation; all perfect.  He was excited about this one.  So, he was taking even more care and deliberation with her than the others.  This was to be the epitome of his accomplishments and there was no room for errors.  Not that he ever made them.
	So, he drove his little scarlet Ford Taurus to her street, parked in a garage, walked up the street to her house, and just took it all in.  Side street, separated from the next house by about ten feet, red brick, high windows, and one car in the driveway.  Exemplary.
	Not one person noticed him pacing through the circular pools of light along the otherwise 
 
dark street.  He was naturally inconspicuous, escaping notice effortlessly.  A blessing really; it made his work easier.
	After a few hours of this, he returned to his apartment to plan.  He plotted until he was satisfied with his work and could hold his heavy eyelids open no longer.  He then slid under his covers and dreamt of the promise in tomorrow night.
	The day seemed to drag on forever.  Not many contributors, just labeling, storing, and paperwork.  Not that he did not enjoy it, but all of this was inferior to what he would be seeing tonight.  The seconds moved too slowly to count.
	Finally, it was quitting time.  He practically skipped home and retrieved his supplies.  After a quick dinner of tomato soup and sandwiches, he left for the Heights.

42,The house in Alabama,1299899564,"This story takes place in Huntsville, Alabama in late 2004. My girlfriend at the time had moved down there for a semester for an internship doing social work for a low-income elementary school. She got the job through a family friend who also worked out a place for her to live while she was there.

It was a very old house occupied by one very old and cranky widow; I did not like the lady from the first time I met her and the house had kind of a creepy vibe to it. Everything was very old, old black-and-white photos on the wall, an old piano, old furniture and quilts, everything was just very... OLD.

The first night there I got in town late and slept in my lady friend's room with her (since the widow had already gone to bed, she was a conservative christian and was not happy about this). The next night I was to sleep in an upstairs guest bedroom across the hall from the widow. 

As soon as I put my stuff down and sat on the bed, something about the room just didn't feel right. This sounds very cliche, but it seemed to me like I wasn't alone in the room. I laid down and was having a hard time going to sleep because of this uneasy, paranoid feeling (which I'd never experienced before, I have sleep apnea and usually fall asleep right away). After over an hour of lying in bed, as soon as I finally fell asleep, I went straight into a dream (and I mean THE SECOND I fell asleep) where I was lying exactly where I was, except for in the chair at the foot of the bed was the widow's deceased husband, sitting there, completely dead. I recognized him from a picture I'd seen on the walls and was immediately horrified by this because I knew he was dead. Then I started getting this warm, pleasant feeling from him. He wasn't saying anything, he was dead, but I felt like he was giving me a vibe of being very friendly and harmless. Somehow, this calmed me down, so I laid back down and went to sleep (still in the dream).

As soon as I fell asleep in the dream, I woke up in the same spot and immediately checked the chair, which, thankfully, did not have a dead man sitting in it. After this ordeal, I felt at ease about sleeping in this room, and fell asleep without any more uneasy feelings (although still not feeling alone).

The next morning I describe this vivid dream in detail to my girlfriend. She kind of laughs it off, but tells me that everyone has told her how friendly and kind and jolly the old man was when he was still alive, and it's hard to explain but the way she described him sounded exactly like the vibe I was getting from him during the dream.

Later that evening my gf and I were sitting in the den watching TV. This is where it gets a bit strange. There was a fireplace in the room, and we had been sitting there watching TV for an hour or more, when all of a sudden, the fireplace doors swing open. Not slam open, not slide open slowly, but kind of open like you would open them to prepare a fire, smoothly and all the way. We both look at each other with a WTF kind of look. Without saying anything, I get up and go close the fireplace doors. About 20 seconds after I sit back down, they open again. Now we both have no idea what's going on and kind of laugh about it. I get up, close the doors again, and say ""meh, must just be a draft or something"", then look outside to see a perfectly calm, cool evening. I go sit back down and again about 10-20 seconds later, only ONE of the fireplace doors open, to which I immediately reply ""well, there goes my draft theory."" and the mood in the room changed to a more serious one. Something was happening that we really couldn't explain. I just left the door open (half afraid to walk back over there) but nothing else really happened that night and I left the next day.

That's where my story ends but my gf stayed at the house for several more months. For an entire month the widow went overseas and left her there alone. She told me many strange stories of lights being on she knew she left off, doors being unlocked which were locked, and some crazier stuff. She eventually moved out because of this one:

One day she gets up to take a shower, goes into the bathroom, turns on the shower, and nothing, no running water. So she checks the kitchen sink, nothing. She goes to a friends to take a shower and then calls the water company, who confirms that her water is turned on and should be working. She then goes back to the house to find a towel in the shower, so she picks it up and it's *soaking wet*, dripping water like someone had tossed it in and turned the water on. After that she walked out and never slept in the house again.

She also called me one morning. They had house guests and she was made to sleep in the room I had slept in upstairs. She called to tell me she knew exactly the uneasy feeling in that room that I had told her about, but she didn't have any crazy dreams.

I thought it was very strange, and still do. I still can't say I believe in ghosts 100%, but I definitely think there is something going on which we currently cannot explain. The fireplace doors moving on their own was weird, the water story gave me chills, but the dream is what really opened my eyes to ""the unexplained"" because it was such an indescribable personal experience like nothing I had EVER been through. So that's my story, not the most exciting or scary, but completely true and not embellished in any way.

43,It's not what you think...,1299892582,"I live in a pretty old house that tends to make a lot of noise at night. You get used to the bumps and scrapes that happen while you are lying there trying to get to sleep, but sometimes there's a feeling of such creepiness that you feel the panic rising no matter how calm the house actually is.

Last night was the last night I am staying here. After what happened I just can't take it any more and am ready to pack my bags and leave. You could argue that it was all my imagination or sleep paralysis or whatever you want to call it but I know what I felt. I know what occurred and I don't want to have anything to do with this place any more.

So last night I'm lying there in bed with my SO, just readying myself for sleep. Just as I begin to drift off I feel something in my hair. Now we get a lot of cockroaches and spiders in this house so I think ""Great I've got a bug in my hair"". But then the feeling changes into more of a scratching and now I'm freaking out. I reach slowly behind me and grab for what is in my hair. My hand brushes against something and I realise that it's not a bug. It's a hand.  A hand is in my hair scratching at my head. I jerked upright and felt my stomach drop to the bottom of my feet. To say I was afraid is an understatement. I was paralysed. I knew it wasn't my SO who had touched my hair because he was fast asleep next to me. 

I lay there for ten minutes with my eyes screwed up so tight they were beginning to hurt. I didn't want to see what was in the room with me. I just wanted to crawl under the covers and pretend like everything was okay. After what felt like a lifetime I gathered up every ounce of courage I had and looked around the room. I couldn't see anything or hear anything so I got up out of bed, grabbed the fire poker and went to see if anyone had broken into the house. As I get to the lounge room I hear it. Three loud knocks on the window. I freeze again and stand there listening. Two more knocks. I run back to the bedroom and close the door, finally succumbing to the need to hide under the covers. I stay there all night. Listening. Waiting. 

I haven't told my SO what happened. He'd think I was being paranoid. But the thing that really freaked me out last night was that the knocks hadn't come from outside....",nosleep,Kizzim,/r/nosleep/comments/g2bma/its_not_what_you_think/
44,An unexpected late-night visitor at the mortuary.,1299891391,"This story was told to me by my uncle. I don't know whether it's true or not, but he swore that this really happened to him.

When my uncle was in his twenties, he used to work many odd jobs to make ends meet. He was never really the type to enjoy a 9-5, instead preferring to move around and work strange jobs. As a result, he has endless stories from all the gigs that he picked up.

When he was 24, he found himself in a small border town in Texas, where he found work at a mortuary. He didn't have a place to stay, so his boss, the owner of the mortuary, decided to let him stay in a small room upstairs in the mortuary.

After a couple of weeks of working at this place, the owner and my uncle became pretty good friends. After my uncle's shifts were over, the owner would invite him back to his house to have dinner with his family. During these dinner conversations, my uncle's boss would tell him stories about weird shit that would occur at the mortuary; strange noises, doors slamming randomly, voices, etc. My uncle, unmoved by all the stories, would laugh and after dinner, would walk back to the mortuary and go to sleep.

One night, after returning from dinner with his boss' family, my uncle arrived at the mortuary just as a storm began. He said that he walked inside of the mortuary, closed and locked the door behind him, and walked towards his room. As he was walking down the main hallway, he remembered that there was a casket with a man's body in the main viewing room, apparently ready for the next day's wake. He closed the door to the room and walked into the reception area, where there was a small television. He turned on the TV and sat back to watch some late night shows as the storm passed.

Sometime at around midnight, the lights went out. The storm outside was fierce. He lit a candle and walked around the building to make sure that all the windows were closed and that everything was OK. Just as he was walking down the main hallway, headed towards the stairs to get to his room, he thought he heard heavy footsteps on the porch. 

Thinking that it was somebody looking to get out of the storm, he started to walk towards the door to let them in. As he got closer to door, the doorknob started to move and shake violently. He decided that he'd better turn back and grab the gun that the owner kept in the office, just in case it was somebody trying to break in and he'd have to defend himself. 

He ran to the office, found the gun, and started to head back towards the front door. But before he was able to reach the main hallway, he heard the front door swing open. A strong gust of wind swooped through the hallway and into the reception room, extinguishing the lone candle he had in his hand, leaving him in complete darkness. He quickly ducked behind one the couches in the reception room and prepared to take aim.

He heard the front door slam shut. Through the rain pounding on the windows, he heard a strange low murmurous growl coupled with rapid breathing, and then quick explosions of splashes that sounded like a large woolly dog shaking off water. He then heard four heavy footsteps begin walking on hardwood floor of the hallway, with thick loud clicks that sounded like large claws scraping against the floor. He said that he was suddenly overtaken by a sense of dread and terror, and he instantly froze. He silently slid to the ground behind the couch and he heard as the footsteps slowly advance down the hallway.

As the footsteps got closer to the opening that lead into the room where he was, he felt himself engulfed by a surreal panic that terrified him to his core. His body began shaking uncontrollably as an ugly feeling of desperation began to grow in his stomach. He found himself drenched in sweat, and a realization flashed through his mind: *he might not make it out of this place alive.* He closed his eyes and began focusing on trying to calm himself down so as to not give himself away. 

Before long, the footsteps were right at the opening of the room where he was hiding. My uncle didn't have the guts to glance over the sofa to see who or what was standing there. There wasn't any movement for a few seconds, which were then interrupted by quick raspy sniffs and again only the sound of the rain pounding against the windows and the roof. My uncle held his breath. Then, he heard the door to the viewing room where the casket was kept (located directly across the hallway from the reception room where he was) open, and the footsteps clanked away from him into this room. The door slammed shut.

My uncle tried to move, but he was too overwhelmed with fear. He decided that his best option was to stay  exactly where he was, waiting for whatever or whoever it was that was in that other room to leave, or for morning to arrive, whichever came first. He didn't want to make any noise or cause anything to attract the attention of whatever that being was; its presence filled that entire place with a heavy feeling of hopelessness and irrational fear. It jumbled my uncle's brain. He told me that he's never been a religious person at all, but  that night, the longest night of his life, all he could think of doing was praying to every god he could think of.

He stayed behind that couch for two hours (as counted by the cuckoo clock), never once daring to peer over the couch. At around 2 am, he said he heard the door of the viewing room swing open once more, and again, those dreaded heavy footsteps clanked upon the hardwood floor of the hallway. He heard the door slowly squeak closed and the footsteps headed down the hallway, towards the front door. He heard the front door open, and then quickly slam close. As soon as the front door closed, he felt like he'd regained control of his body and he was finally able to relax and move around. He was deeply shaken, but felt relieved that this thing was gone. 

After he'd lit his candle, he slowly walked into the hallway, and found that the area around the front door was drenched with water and mud; the floor, the walls, everything. He followed the puddles of water and smudges of mud down the hallway, all the way into the viewing room, right next to the casket.

That was the last night he spent in that mortuary. He quit the very next morning. He didn't even stick around to help  clean up the mess. ",nosleep,illmindedjunkie,/r/nosleep/comments/g2ba3/an_unexpected_latenight_visitor_at_the_mortuary/
45,Something happens at 2:45am,1299883649,"Strange things happen at 2:45am. It doesn't really seem to matter where you're at either, and it's always 2:45am. That seems to be the witching hour when a portal opens up and all the crazies of the city and shemale prostitutes take to the predetermined corners of Peachtree Road.

I remember one of the strangest things I'd ever seen as if it were yesterday, naturally, at 2:45am.

A friend and I, coming back from a party in Chamblee, hopped onto the MARTA. ""This is the last train for the night"" a voice resounded over the intercom. ""Lucky us."" I thought.

We took our seats in the middle of the train. I sat behind my friend and he sat in front so that we could both look out the windows at the beautiful city as we chatted our way from Chamblee Station to North Avenue.

""How you feeling?"" he asked hoarsely.

I looked at him for a moment. His eyes were bloodshot, and I could tell I was probably looking into a mirror.

""Tired.""

""Oglethorpe Center Station"" the automated voice over the intercom informed us.

Suddenly, three obvious crazies made their way through the doors, which shut behind them with a mild ""bing-bong.""

""Check this out, the retard trifecta."" My friend said, I laughed and began reviewing the three new patrons.

One of them was an obese woman rattling on about what a great president Clinton was, it made no sense, but she was secure in her convictions. The next, was a tall black man dressed in mere rags for clothes who seemed to shuffle along in silence and the last looked like he'd just escaped the loony-bin. His hair was rough and unkempt, he was dressed in a heavy coat and rocked back and forth in his chair, mumbling incessantly.

""Jeez."" My friend started to laugh as he shook his head.

""I can't stand MARTA.""

""That's the price you pay when getting drunk."" I smiled at saying this.

Supposedly, each of these people had actual stops, because they slowly made their way off of the train and into the night. It wasn't until Arts Center that came the strangest thing my friend and I had ever witnessed.

A tall man stepped on, disheveled, pale skin like bleached milk, hair darker than pitch and sporting a nice dress suit. Attached to him was a woman, she, paler than him. He whispered to her and giggled as if they were carrying on a conversation, but she did not reply.

He moved in such a way that let us know he was not in fact walking beside her, but carrying her, her feet dangling just above the ground. Then something happened that sent me and my friend into near shock, her face flopped in our direction, eyes wide open, devoid of life, sockets surrounded by rings of red. He was carrying a corpse. He sat her down on a seat in the far back and propped her against his shoulder, where he continued to converse.

""Look."" My friend whispered fearfully. I couldn't take my eyes off of the beautiful blond corpse. She was dressed in a long, white skirt and tiny black slip on shoes.

Something happens at 2:45am, and sometimes, you're what happens, sometimes, even the most diabolical people carrying corpses become the victim of sheer, unadulterated fear. I stood up, approached the man and his corpse, he looked up slowly.

""Is that your corpse?"" I asked in the most neutral tone one can speak.

It was as if I stole more than just his courage, but his soul, it was if I'd taken all the energy right out of him, because when the train stopped and the intercom let us know that we had ""arrived at Midtown Station,"" he loosed his grip from the girl, stood up and scurried out through the nearest door.

""Bing-bong."" The train spoke. ""Clunk."" Said the body of the girl as she landed in the chair. The train moved and she swayed, I could only watch.

Something happens at 2:45am, I don't know what it is, but something happens.

46,This all happened to me last night. True story. ,1299882916,"I was struggling to fall asleep last night because I've had this god-awful cough for the past week or so. Anyway, I'm starting to settle down and whatnot, and I notice that light is permeating the surface of my outer-eyelids. I open them and look straight ahead at my closed (locked) door and I notice that my hallway light is on. My roommate is hours and hours away for Spring Break, but the fact that I'm so tired makes me think it's just the sun (it's probably 5:30AM, so not possible yet + it wouldn't be that bright).

So I ignore it and go to sleep. In my dream, I was in some lawyer's office or something like that, and it was all very mundane and we were just talking, then all of a sudden, the lawyer's mouth opens and screams. Kind of like that freaky gif of the little girl in the mirror. I wake up pretty quickly and feel a lot of sweat on my face, only... oh, it's not sweat. It's blood. All over my head. And at that moment, I coughed up some vomit. (Didn't throw up, just coughed it up. Never did that before)

I've inspected my head to see where blood could have come from, but I can't figure it out. It wasn't a nosebleed, because there's no blood remnants in my nose and I would have been clogged as fuck. It's all very weird.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g28ok/this_all_happened_to_me_last_night_true_story/
47,Sometimes they slip between the worlds,1299881771,"The events of this story all happened about 15 years ago.  It involves me and my close friend who we will call J.  

We grew up in a small town in Northwest Iowa.  The smaller the town the less there was to do (probably why it seemed 99.9% of the teenage population was drunk all the time).  His house was on a slight hill just outside of town so it didn't catch the bright lights of the ""big city"".  The quiet was what always got me about his place.  Just complete quiet.  The house was one of those old farm houses sturdy but you could tell the place had history.  His room was directly upstairs and it was here that we spent most of our summers and after school time.  It was always chilly in the room and damp.  The dampness was the weird part.  Nothing was wet (although it felt wet) and even with the windows open in the summer with the sun beating down it was still cool and damp.  No where else in the house felt like this and we often made fun of him saying his room was haunted and blah blah.  If I would have known then what I know now it wouldn't have been so funny.

One lazy afternoon just before dusk I was laying around the house doing whatever teenagers did in the mid 90's.  I heard my mom yell from the kitchen that J was on the phone.  When I picked up all I heard was panicked breathing and ""ohgodohgodohgod"" under his breath.  Startled I asked him what was wrong.  He hurriedly told me I had to get there as fast as I could.  His parents were out of town shopping and he was scared to go back in the house.  Apparently he was laying in the living room watching tv (his room was directly above the living room) when he heard a loud *thud* from above.  Figuring it was his dog he started yelling at her to get out of his room.  Looking at the ceiling he could hear whatever it was slowly start sliding across his bedroom floor towards the stairs.  It was only then that he look at the bottom of the stairs to see his dog hunched quietly with all the hairs standing up on her back looking up the stairs.  Needless to say his first reaction was to bolt out the backdoor grabbing the phone on the way out to call me.

It all sounded so fake to me that I started laughing and decided what the hell I had nothing else to do.  So I told him I would be right over and jumped on my bike to start the ride out there.  On my way I was smiling to myself thinking of how best to catch him in his lie or trick or whatever he had laid out for me.  

As I pulled up to his house I remembered the sound of the gravel as my tires came up his driveway and his terrified face as he sat in his front yard waiting.  From the look on his face all notions of this being ""fake"" went straight out of my head.  He was absolutely terrified.  After he described what happened we sat in silence, the kind you can only get on a country road somewhere in middle America.  It was still light out but getting towards the point of knowing the sun will be dropping soon.  It seemed very silly to be so scared standing outside of a house with the sun and birds chirping.  We both decided it was best to go in the house to see what we could hear (not the brightest bunch).  

Everything seemed perfectly fine when we walked in.  The TV was still on and his dog laid in her usual position on the couch.  Nothing was out of the ordinary.  We stood at the bottom of the stairs looking up neither of us daring to take the first step.  It was best, we decided, to wait until his parents came home and just wait it out watching tv.  As we were sitting there you could feel the tension as we waited for something to happen.  

The events that happened next were never clear to me.  I don't know if my brain is too fragile to handle the horror and has blocked out most of it or if it really happened so fast that there was no time to take it all in.  I have never had the chance to speak of this with J, as he hasn't said anything at all since the incident.  The doctors have heard nothing but screams during the night from him for 15 years.  As we were sitting there, both of us jumped as we heard a thud from directly above us.  We both jumped up as we heard the slow dragging on the hardwood floor towards the stairs.  This time the dog was going wild jumping in circles barking at the bottom of the stairs.  I remember saying something like ""fuck this"" or whatever passed as pure shock talk and glancing at my friend.  He started for the stairs as his dog finally had enough and flew up the steps.  I could see what he was trying to do and remember trying to reach for him as he jumped for the dog.  Then came the screams.  I don't know if they started upstairs or from us first but where ever they started it was loud.  My heart was pounding as I turned and bolted for the door thinking J was right behind me.  It wasn't until I was outside that I realized I was alone.  I turned towards the house and could hear nothing.  I started yelling for J terrified to take a step towards the house.  Doing the bravest thing I have possibly felt I have done yet I started towards the house.  I couldn't leave him. 

From here everything seems to be flashes.  Stepping back into the house, the silence, whispering for J, walking towards the steps, halfway up the stairs seeing blood, upstairs hallway dead dog ripped open, door to my friends bedroom torn slightly off the hinges, friend rocking back and forth shirtless in the doorway bite mark on shoulder.  The air was thick, so thick breathing was almost impossible.  The panic rushing through me as I grabbed him around the waist pulling him towards the steps.  He wasn't fighting, he wasn't doing anything just staring straight ahead letting me lead him.  When I reached the stairs I turned slightly and terrified started down the stairs as I heard another thump.  This time it was the skittering fast footsteps towards us as I froze halfway down.  I still felt as if I couldn't breath the thickness was suffocating.  I could feel a pressure building in my ears, the kind you feel when coming in for a landing on a plane.  J started to scream in my arms as he looked behind me.  I could hear the giggle coming directly behind and felt my bladder give way as I finally came to my senses and ran.  That giggle was madness.....it sounded like it was directly behind me as I bolted for the door with my screaming friend thrashing back and forth in my arms.   All these years later I can still feel the chills as I reached the door and heard finally the voice in between the insane gutwrenching giggle....""he's mine...and you are too""",nosleep,gorillabitches5000,/r/nosleep/comments/g28ab/sometimes_they_slip_between_the_worlds/
48,I just wish I could be sure,1299880550,"   In my old hometown there is a long and narrow road that winds beside the river, aptly named ""River Road"". In my younger days it was my favorite place to clear my head late at night because it was pretty solitary after sundown, thanks to some treacherous turns and a complete absence of streetlights. It's no surprise that when I visit my parents, I usually try to drive along the old street for the sake of some nostalgic bliss. That is up until my last trip home.
   
It started with me in bed trying to catch some sleep, when I received a call from my girlfriend at about 3AM. She was feeling lonely and was upset due to my lack of calling her. Knowing that an argument was probably inevitable, I decided to get out of bed and hop into my car as to be able to talk without fear of being listened to by my parents. I decide that River Road would be an ideal place for me to drive and talk, because windy roads and cell phones are a great mix I guess. 

As I drove along the path I knew so well, I began to get more engaged in the conversation. Since I hadn't seen a soul all night I figured I was pretty safe. It was insanely dark, but I had headlights so I assumed I could see enough of the road to stay on it. Easy. Right at the pinnacle of my heated conversation I took my eyes off the road for a split second to look at my phone, as if it was the object causing my anger. The moment I looked back at the road I couldn't believe my eyes. I still don't entirely.

A little girl. She looked like maybe she was nine years old. I wish I could describe her better, but it happened so fast. Her arms waved at the car violently, begging me to stop as she stood square in the middle of the street. I slammed on the brakes, knowing full well she was too close for me to stop. In those split seconds before I hit I felt and thought nothing. Adrenaline was coursing into my veins, but not nearly fast enough to allow me to react in time. Then I hit... and nothing. She disappeared into a blast of fog as I came to a complete stop. I started to question whether what happened could possibly be real, as I looked in the rear view and saw absolutely nothing. No girl, No mist, no anything. Then I looked ahead, and all I saw were glowing little eyes looking up at me from the street, just out of range of my headlights. Dozens of little eyes fixed on me.

At this point I was more confused than scared. I just needed to know what the hell was going on, so I pulled forward slowly. Then the tiny creatures' dark body outlines get into range, though it did nothing to divert attention from those glowing eyes. Finally they are bathed in light and I see... kittens. There must have been at least 15 crossing the road, and there is no way I would have seen them in time if I hadn't already been stopped. They had seemingly lost interest in me and continued crossing the street in a single file line. At this point I realize my girlfriend is on the cellphone screaming to find out if I am okay, to which all I can really respond is ""Kittens..."" The last two of them stop right in front of my car and look up at me for about 5 seconds before scurrying off with the rest of their crew. 
   
I still don't know what the hell it was I saw, whether it was an optical illusion or a young animal loving girl's spirit, but I will never forget the experience.

As I raced through my empty house, I could almost hear something behind me. When I finally grabbed my flashlight and turned it on, it felt as if the room was just emptied of some unseen entity.

50,The Ouija Board,1299877789,"The following story is a true story, and one I always bring up when people start talking about Ouija boards, or the paranormal in general. I haven't shared anything to r/Nosleep yet, but I thought this'd be a nice start. I've got many stories, and this is the beginning:



When I was about 5 years-old, my ""favorite"" aunt, Ivy, was a rebellious 15 year-old punk chick living in Mexico. Our houses were right across the street from each other, but even so, she'd rarely ever hang out with us because it ~wasn't the cool thing to do.~

One day, Ivy showed up at our house, completely terrified, and would not leave my side. And I mean it. Would. Not. Leave. My. Side. She told me she was really scared that something was after her, and she didn't want me to leave her alone. She even followed me to the bathroom!

I asked her what happened. She said that she had been at her friend's house, hanging out with their little group, and someone had the bright idea of bringing out a Ouija board. Despite knowing that her grandma strictly forbid the use of Ouija boards (she was very sensitive to paranormal things, I'm told), Ivy played anyway. All was fun and games, until some smartass kid decided to say the magic words:

""If Satan is among us today, give us a sign.""

As soon as the words left the kid's lips, a lit cigarette that was sitting in the ashtray on the table flipped over, and as it hit the carpet, the carpet burst into flames. Needless to say, they all got freaked out and ran out of the house, and back to their own.

As far as I'm concerned, the story ends there, because that's freaky enough. If you ask my mom, though, she'll tell you that Ivy's later misfortunes in life were caused by that incident, and her provoking something she shouldn't have. 

And to this day, I've never touched a Ouija board.

Anyone else have Ouija stories to share? I'd love to hear them.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g26xd/the_ouija_board/

Blissful ignorance can be the thing that lets you sleep at night, the thing that lets you hold your sanity together. It can be what prevents you from falling apart at the seams.


What ancient horrors has humanity forgotten? What eldritch experiences have people never lived to tell the tale about... Or lost their ability to coherently do so. Is every person we’ve locked up in an asylum truly insane?

One of my favorites was a large gorilla, about the size of a raccoon, who I had, in all the wisdom of a 5-year-old, named ""Bananas"".  I played with Bananas all the time, he was sort of my constant companion.

Then one day, I was playing in my room, which faced the kitchen.  My parents were sitting at the table, and I was in full view of them.  I was playing with some toys, cars I think, when I looked over at Bananas.  I thought I saw him move.  Being a child with an active imagination, I didn't think much of it, and went back to playing with my cars.

I saw movement again out of the corner of my eye, and turned to see Bananas rushing me.  I tried to push him away but he overpowered me.  There was such rage, such power for what was essentially some fabric and cotton.  His hands were too small, too soft to strangle me...but I knew he was trying.  His hands were around my neck, and he was holding me down. 

My parents didn't respond right away.  I guess they thought I was playing.  When they heard me struggling and gasping they rushed in and pulled Bananas off me.

I've spent so much of my adult life trying to convince myself that it was a vivid dream that imprinted on me like a memory.  But the memory is so clear, I remember the terror, the feeling of something trying (albeit failing miserably) to choke me.  

I try to tell myself that it's a coincidence that around that time Bananas was put on a high shelf in the living room, and that my parents had some good reason that they weren't telling me why I couldn't play with Bananas anymore.  Either way, my parents refuse to discuss it to this day, and go a little tense and a little pale if I try to bring it up.

I try to rationalize the other times I saw a black mass moving across the floor at night, peeking around corners.

It was a dream, I tell myself.  A silly childhood nightmare that scared me so much it's stayed with me to this day, even when few other memories of my early childhood remain.  To this day, I have an almost crippling phobia of strangulation.  The slightest pressure or tightness around my neck is enough to give me a panic attack.

It was a dream.  I tell myself that.  But a part of me, a deep, deep part of me is screaming that it isn't true.",nosleep,insomniavision,/r/nosleep/comments/g1ub7/the_night_a_toy_tried_to_kill_mea_childhood/

Being a new redditor and terrible writer, it might not be the best, but this memory is something that has stuck with me for some time and I'd like to share it. Here it goes. 

My whole life, my whole family has lived on the same road. By that, I mean everyone I'm related to in this state lives within a mile from one another. That being said, we are pretty close to everyone else who loves on this road as well. When I was around 8 (20 now), I went with my grandpa to his neighbor's house. This man was much older than my grandpa. He was a nice man, and me being a small child, as well as my cousin who was with me, he liked to joke around with us. He pulled quarters from behind our ears, told jokes, all the typical things. He liked to wear button up shirts and bib overalls every day, just like the typical older men around here. Nothing out of the ordinary. 
Fast forward 2 years, the man passed away and my grandparents moved to his house after some heavy remodeling. Me and my cousin, Jordan, both lived with them. The house had a basement, 4 rooms and a half bath in the middle floor, and an upstairs. There is a door in the living room that leads to a flight of stairs. It's a big open room with only a full bath and a closet. 
One night after a heated game of NASCAR on ps1, Jordan and I had gotten into a fist fight (bad tempers). I stayed in our room while he went to the couch in the living room. After a while, I decided to apologize. I walked into the kitchen and could see him from there under his covers. As I stepped in to the living room, the upstairs door swung open, almost whacking me in the face. No one was up there. I peeked around the edge of the door and looked at the couch. Jordan was there, barely peeking over the blanket. You could see the fear in his eyes. I turned to look at the stairs, but it was too dark to see anything. I felt around. Nothing. I walked up the first 2 stairs, then I saw him. A faint white figure of an old man, barely visible, wearing bib overalls and a button up shirt. All of a sudden, I felt paralyzed. I couldn't move. I stared right at him. It was all I could do, but he never looked at me. He was looking past me. When I could finally move, I turned to see what he found so interesting. Jordan was right behind me in the same frozen state that I had been in. His mouth was wide open. Finally, he fell back, said a few choice words and fled. I followed in what seemed like slow motion. He was already huddled up under a blanket on our bunk bed 'fort' we had built when I got there, and all I could do was huddle up next to him. We laid there in complete silence until morning came, not sleeping a wink and talking even less it felt like. At the peak of daylight I finally turned to him, his eyes still open as wide as his mouth was. He looked back, shook his head, and we never spoke of it again. 
To this day we are still as close as brothers and both of us use caution when opening the upstairs door, but neither of us have talked about what happened, even after almost 11 years. ",nosleep,GroovyTrout,/r/nosleep/comments/g1u6w/the_stairs/
58,Mary,1299835673,"*DISCLAIMER: this story happened almost 20 yrs ago, so some details I forgot. It's also a real story with real people. I don't want to use their real names (except for Mary). So I'm using fake names. Also, as any real story, it’s also a long &amp; complicated to tell.*

This all happened on a cold Sunday evening in October 1992. I was a normal, social 14 yrs old kid living in a small town. That particular evening, I was at the arcade downtown hanging out with my friends David, John, Gil , Peter and three girls (can’t remember their names, except for one named Natalie, with whom David was trying to hook up.)

It was a Sunday evening, so it was pretty boring. There was almost nobody else other than us in the arcade. 

Later that evening, two other friends of ours arrived: Colin and Patrick. After that, all I remember is that at some point of the evening we were outside the arcade and Patrick started telling us a story himself had been told by a guy named Matthew (a guy we all knew).

*(Before I tell Matthew's story as told to us by Patrick, I need to explain that in our small town there was a family of crackpots everybody was scared of: the Jones. They were poor, dirty, crazy and many. Lot of rumours and gossips going around town about how they were Satanists and stuff like that.)*

Our friend Patrick told us the story he had heard from Matthew. (To make this less confusing, that story will be set apart as quoted text)

&gt; About 2 years prior (1990) Matthew was hanging out with two girls, Caroline and Melissa. *(In 1992, I knew those two girls. They were polar opposites. Caroline was a striking blonde with the hottest ass in High School. Melissa was the opposite. She was a scrawny, ugly, face-full of zits junkie &amp; dealer.)*

&gt; So Matthew had been hanging out with those two girls when they were approached by Erik Jones, the youngest of the Jones sons. Erik Jones was maybe 5 or 6 years older than us. I had seen him a couple of times around town. He was a tall and skinny mofo. He always wore a long black trench coat with black combat boots. He looked downright scary.

&gt; Erik Jones told them that he once had a younger sister, Mary, who had died very young (like, 4 or 5 yrs odl). She also died before being baptized. Now, I grew up Catholic, but my family had never been religious. I don’t really know the theological details of what being dead before being baptized entails. I think it means your soul stays in limbo or something. Anyway. To Erik Jones, the fact that his sister Mary died before being baptized was a big deal.

&gt; Erik Jones told Matthew, Caroline &amp; Melissa that he could summon the spirit of his dead sister. They didn’t believe him, so Erik brought them to the cemetery where his sister Mary was buried. Her grave had just one little unmarked white cross, because the Jones were too poor for a real headstone. Erik then told the others that he’d summon his sister, but when he’d say “Run”, they absolutely had to get the fuck outta there. The four of them then held hands over the grave of Mary, while Erik was calling his little sister’s name: 
&gt; * “Mary, Mary, Mary. I summon you!” 

&gt; It went  on for a while until Erik finally yelled “RUN!” and the 4 of them sprinted away from there.

&gt; Once out of the cemetery, Caroline told Erik that, as she was running away, she felt pushed forward. Melissa, on the other hand, felt as if she was pulled backwards. Erik told them that they had been touched by the spirit of his little sister. Caroline, who had been pushed forward, would be successful in everything for the rest of her life. Melissa, who had been held back, was cursed to struggle. 

Back in 1992 now. 

Once Patrick finished telling us that story, I called bullshit, but Colin, John and Gil  felt very uneasy and a bit in shock. I didn’t get it. Thing was, I didn’t knew Caroline and Melissa back in 1990 when that story happened. My friends did. They explained to me that back then, both girls weren’t the polar opposites they had become later on. In 1990, they were very much the same and were very good friends. Their respective lives at changed completely since then.

It’s Sunday evening, we’re youths bored out of our minds, the cemetery of Matthew’s story is about 30-45 mins of walking distance, and we’re curious. The rest is easy to guess. 

Our little gang decided to walk all the way to the cemetery to see if the white cross was there. If it wasn’t there, then the story was bullshit.

30+ mins later, we’re at the cemetery. It was close to the street, so we could check it out while walking on the sidewalk. The front of the cemetery was delimited by a little stone wall about 4 feet high, on which stood big iron spikes spaced about 5 inches from each other made it impossible to get in. We walked over the entrance which was a big black iron gate. It was locked. 

As we were standing there on the sidewalk wondering how to get in, a police car passed by and stopped right next to us.   One of the cop rolled his window down and interjected:

* **Cop**: What are you doing there kids?
* **Us**: Nothing! Just looking around, Just walking.
* **Cop**: Yeah. You trying to get in the cemetery?
* **Us**: Noooo. Just walking around
* **Cop**: Dont go in there. It’s dangerous. Alright? Stay out of the cemetery kids.

Then the car left. We were kinda stuck. Couldn’t really get in from the front side, especially not after the cops had spotted us. So we kept walking along the front of the cemetery until we reached the corner of the front wall. The side of the cemetery border was different. It was just a chain-link fence. A 10-feet tall chain-link fence. At that point, we kinda gave up trying to get in. We just wanted to look inside and see if there was a white cross as in the story.

We walked alongside the chain-link fence, looking in the cemetery. It was pretty dark and there wasn’t any lights around, making things just more difficult. We had been walking for about 10 mins along that border and hadn’t seen anything resembling a white cross. We kept going, then:

* **John**: Hey! There!
* **Me**: Woah! That’s it!

Right on the other side of the fence, at the very end of a row, apart from other graves, it was there. A little unmarked white cross. Just as in the story. We waited for the rest of the gang to catch up to us. We were all standing there, leaning against the fence, looking at the cross. It was a weird feeling, seeing that thing there. Made Matthew’s story feel a whole lot more real.

* **John**: Let’s get in there!
* **Colin**: You’re insane. That fence is 10 feet high. 
* **John**: Come on! We got all the way here now.
* **Gil **: John, you’re a crazy mofo.

We argued back and forth a bit. I then remembered that on our way up here, we had passed by a tree that was in the cemetery, but had big branches that were passing over the fence. We could easily climb the fence, grab a branch and get in the cemetery via the tree. So we did just that. The hardest part was to grab the girls and help them climb up the fence, and get them down on the other side.

Once we got in the cemetery, we walked back to where the white cross was. We checked it out. There was nothing written on it. Just a little white cross made of wood. It looked kinda worn out, but not ancient. Made the story even more plausible.

I don’t know who suggested it, but we got the idea of trying to do as in the story and summon the ghost of Mary Jones. I’d learn later that, once we chose to do that, nothing would ever be the same again.

So we gathered around in a circle, all 10 of us. I think it was David who started to call Mary’s name. We were all somewhat nervous, chuckling and cracking jokes,

* **David**: Maryyyyy. Maryyyyy. Maryyyyy, fucking bitch! 
* **Rest of us**: Hahaha, David, you sound like a dumbass!
* **John**: Mariyyyyyy! Mariyyyyyy. C’mere girl! C’mere!
* **Gil **: Hahaha! 
* **One of the girls**: Maybe we need to hold hands so it works?

So we all started holding hand, still in a circle around Mary’s grave.

* **Colin**: Someone… Come on, anyone, summon her!
* **Me**: Fine, I’ll do it…

I began to summon Mary. To be honest, I felt like a big dork doing that, so I didn’t really put much heart into it.

* **Me**: Maaaaryyyyy… Maaaaryyyyyy… Maaaaryyyyyy… Maaaaryyyyyy…
* **Natalie**: Pffffbwhahahaha!
* **Other girl**: Shut up Natalie! I wanna see if this really works!
* **Me**: Maaaaryyyyy… Maaaaryyyyyy… Maaaaryyyyyy… Mary, we’re all here for you. Please, give us a sign

I know, it sounds like a fucking cliché thing to say. But you’re 14 yrs old and you end up in a cemetery holding hands with your friends calling on the spirit of a dead little girl and you realize you have no fucking clue what you’re doing. So I just went with what I’d seen before. 

* **Me**: Maaaariyyyyyy… Maaariiyyyyyy… We know you’re there. We’re not leaving until you give us a sign!

At that point, I had my eyes closed to focus, but also because I didn’t wanted to see my friends look at me and laugh their asses off. The person holding my left hand was Natalie, and at some point she let go. I opened them and noticed that David and Natalie were now making out. We closed the circle with the 8 people left not making out. Everybody else was fixing the cross and looked sort of serious all in a sudden. So I closed my eyes and kept going…

* **Me**: Maaaaryyyyy… Maaaaryyyyyy… MAAAARIYYYYYY… MAAAARYYYYY….

My voice had become weird even to my own ears. It was serious, authoritarian, imposing. I felt the two people on my sides squeeze my hands a little harder. The mood was all changed now. No more nervous giggles. We were fucking into this.

* **Me**: MAAAARIYYYYYY… MAAAARYYYYY… I COMMAND YOU TO SHOW YOURSELF!

At this point, my voice and words didn’t seem to be my own anymore. My voice was becoming louder and louder… Everything was coming out by itself… 

* **Me**: MAAARYYYYYY… MAAAARYYYYY… MAAAR…

All in a sudden, I choked up. Not a sound would come out of my mouth. At the same time, we heard a loud THUD!

I opened my eyes. One of the girls had fainted and fell on the ground. The mood was fucking weird all in a sudden. Tension in the air was palpable. I was confused because my voice just went extinct all in a sudden, some girl had just fainted. Then David started throwing up. 

A shroud of panic fell on us. Then someone yelled “RUN!”. So we did. We fucking ran for the front gate of the cemetery, the only place where there was any light.

It was total chaos. We were running and slaloming between the graves. One of the girls fell into a ditch or something. Patrick and Colin had ran to the main alley of the cemetery, but it was barred with a big chain about 2 feet off the ground. They never saw it and ran right into it. It tripped them and sent them flying in the air and on the gravel. John tripped on something and twisted his ankle. 

As for me, I managed to avoid any misstep as I ran for the entry gate. Then *it* happened. 

I wouldn’t describe it as a “push”. It felt more like a gust of wind suddenly blowing in my back. To be honest, I really didn’t noticed it at first because I was too busy not running into a freshly dug grave or something. Once I reached the front gate of the cemetery though, I knew. I just knew something had “pushed” me. I just refused to believe it and pushed it to the back of my mind.

The rest of the gang caught up with me at the front gate. Some were in bad shape. We manage to get out of the cemetery by climbing over a little cabin near the front gate and jump on the sidewalk on the other side of the iron pikes.

We caught out breath. Then we naturally started to talk about what had just happened. Then someone asked THE question.

* Did anyone felt pushed or pulled?

We all looked at each other in silence. Nobody said a thing. I didn’t say a thing, but I sorta *knew* that if I had felt pushed, someone out there had to have felt pulled. My eyes crossed Peter’s. We stared at each other for a fraction of a second, but we knew. Then someone asked:

* Who yelled to run?

We all looked at each other. Nobody. Nobody ever confessed of yelling ""Run!"". 

Almost 20 yrs have passed now. That story had become pretty much just any other “crazy things bored teens do” to us. With time, wee all forgot about it. I had forgotten about it. Years passed as they were supposed to. Our gang stayed together for most of high school, then everybody kinda drifted apart. I moved to a big city to study in College, etc. 

Thing is, my life hasn't been all that great. I got news of Peter lately. His life really turned to shit. Drugs, arrests, Hepatitis, etc.  

I just can't help but wonder if things would be different had we not been so bored on that cold October evening... 

Or wonder if Mary has been around Peter and I since then... Watching over us, tilting the balance, influencing events, messing with our lives.

59,Unlocked.,1299829411,"We live in the bad area of town. Granted, it was a lot worse in the 80's, but to the majority of the city, Downtown is still a no-go. I live with my boyfriend, and three other roommates in the fairly dilapidated top two floors of a downtown duplex. We were told the house was over 100 years old, and it has the quaint little 'quirks' about it to prove it. We've always revered it as being the epitome of student living; cheap, and mostly broken. Another ""perk"" was the abundance of dark hiding places the house boasted, as we had discovered when playing drunken hide and seek during a fuze blowout. Storage space galore. 

We had chosen this house for its proximity to the University. It's about a twenty minute walk, which is more than reasonable for a group of students who can't afford a car. Oftentimes we will meet each other on the way in between the university and our house, as we've carved a shortcut that expedites our trip. It had become a running joke, especially between my boyfriend and I, as his classes usually start after mine finishes. We would meet on the path, blurt out a quick 'I love you' and a kiss, and continue on our way. 

One particularly cold night, I met Sam on our usual path. He had a little time before his class, so he stopped long enough to tell me that nobody was home. I groaned, knowing my tendency to imagine the scariest scenarios when alone in that house. I also balked at the thought of Sam leaving the house last; he had misplaced his key and had no way to lock our door. He assured me that this was a nonissue.  What was the danger anyway? If he and I leave the house and the university at the same time respectively, the house only remains unlocked for 20 minutes. What are the odds of someone happening to try our unlocked door in such a short span? Seeing my dubious expression, he added that with 5 people living in the house someone was sure to be home soon. I nodded, calmed by his assurance and said my goodbyes. 

The problem with the middle of winter is how quickly it gets dark. My watch only read 5:45, but the sun was long gone, and the frigid northern streets were deserted. I quickened my pace, even though the thought of our empty student pad was slowly filling me with dread. I pushed the feeling out of my mind as my eyes fixed on the house. Great. All the lights were off. Even the hall light that we always leave on. Maybe it burnt out. I was grateful for the street lamps blazing down on our street. Somehow, the orange light made the house look less threatening, less ominous, as I mounted the steps to our unlocked home. How stupid of me to be so afraid. Sam was right. I was just paranoid. 

I should have been more aware. I thought the lights were my salvation, not my demise. The lights reflected off the windows, making them warped mirrors of the cold Winnipeg streets. Cold, but safe. You see, I couldn't see inside my house. I couldn't see what was waiting for me in my darkened bedroom, but, thanks to the lights, it could see me.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g1sgs/unlocked/
60,China Dream,1299829097,"Julie had lived in the creaky, wood house for a year. When she had first moved in, it had felt like returning home. As a child she had spent many summers here, lounging in the backyard, wandering the mossy woods, and reading in the comfortable silence of the spare room. Her grandmother had stayed busy by puttered around cooking and cleaning. There had never been any dust in the house, only the fragrant scent of freshly baked bread. 

As a student, Julie had been struggling with paying the bills. When she had inherited the estate, she was both melancholy and excited to have a place of her own to live in. Her grandmother, Lucille, had been quite old and frail, but her death had still been regretted. She had spent less and less time at the house as she had grown from a child into a rebellious teenager, but it still harbored fond memories for her. With first step Julie had taken into the place, she had breathed in deeply. She swore the aroma of baked goods still lingered in the air. 

At about the six-month mark, the sweet smells dissipated into stale air. Dust covered flat surfaces, rats could be heard scrabbling in the walls, and leaks had sprung in the attic, the dripping echoing loudly on rainy days. The house seemed darker and the silence was no longer relaxing. At night, alone in the house, Julie ignored the hairs that sprang up on her arms whenever she turned out the bedside lamp, preparing to fall asleep. 

On this particular night, sleep eluded her. Whenever she was on the brink of sleep the house settled, emitting ominous groans like an old man in pain. The noises had never bothered her as a child, but now they made her curl up in a ball with the covers over her head. When breathing became hard under the thick comforter, she convinced herself that as a 26-year-old woman, she should not be afraid of the sounds of a timeworn house. Her encouragement finally enticed her brain into a restless sleep.

She dreamed intermittently of the house and of exploring its rooms. Starting in the kitchen, she toured the living room, moved up the shaky staircase to the second floor and into the hallway outside her room. The room on the right next to hers had been the storage room, but she hadn’t entered it since arriving. In her dream it looked much different. The yellow floral-print walls had been painted over with a sickly green and the stately queen-sized bed had been replaced with a small child-size cot with only plain white sheets. The room was devoid of furnishings besides a shelf on one wall, lined with seven antique porcelain dolls. 

The next morning, Julie woke to sunlight sneaking between the curtains. Her agitated sleep left her feeling more drained than the night before, but she knew she wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep with the sun up. Dragging herself out of bed, she shoved her feet into fuzzy slippers to ward against slivers from the wooden floor. She dressed herself in a thick robe over cotton pajamas, forgoing proper clothing in favor of getting some caffeine. Opening the door to the hallway, she paused, stunned.

A china doll was facing her room, propped against the baseboard opposite her door. Julie took a few deep breaths, willing her heartbeat to slow. Staring at it, unblinking, she shuffled closer with the intention of removing it from the hallway. It blinked, its blue eyes eerily glossy. Julie jumped backwards, half closing the door to her bedroom, using it as a shield for her body. Running through reasonable explanations in her head, she found none. Her breathing came in rapid puffs as if she had just run a mile. 

Watching it, praying that it would not move again, Julie attempted to convince herself that the movement had simply been a figment of her wild imagination. It was just her mind playing tricks on her. Perhaps she had sleepwalked and set the doll there herself. Getting braver by the minute, her breath returned to a normal pace and she no longer clung to the door like a life raft. 

She crept forward, scrutinizing the doll for any indication of unearthly motion. Grabbing it by the right arm, she let it dangle from her fist as far from her body as physically possible. She made her way down the stairs and into the dim living room while keeping one eye on the doll. Tossing it carelessly onto the plastic covered sofa, she turned away and moved towards the kitchen to start boiling water for coffee. The sound of plastic crinkling stopped her.

She spun around instantly, reacting to the noise without thought. The doll was sitting upright, red dress neatly splayed around its ankles. It certainly had not landed in that position. Julie’s heart jumped into her throat and her tongue stuck to the roof of her dry mouth. How was she going to explain away this one?

“You’re going to burn in hell, Julie. You killed me. You did this.” The childish voice emitted from the porcelain doll, mouthing the words with tiny painted lips. Julie tried to find some air in her lungs to scream, but her throat was bundled in a tight knot. “Don’t you remember your younger sister? Don’t you remember staring into my eyes as I went limp, held underwater by your hands? You told everyone you tried to save me as I drowned!”

Julie finally regained control over her muscles. She ran for the front door, hearing giggles behind her. She grabbed the car keys off the wall before escaping into the bright sunlight. She sprinted for the rusted Pontiac, trying to outstrip the memories that the voice had brought back.

61,A dream I had last night,1299825864,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to post my dream, but I wanted to write everything down before I forget.

It started when I heard a noise outside my second-story window.  I woke up looked out to see my neighbors, a young couple, out in their back yard.  They were talking excitedly to each other, but I couldn't make out the words.  Both had rags tied around their hands, were holding shovels, and were frantically digging a hole in their yard.  Without turning on the lights I got out my binoculars to get a closer look.  Both my neighbors looked nervous and scared, and kept glancing around them.  I hunkered down so they couldn't see me.

At closer inspection the rags around their hands were kitchen towels with dark stains.  There was a bucket at their feet, and at the bottom of the bucket was -- oh God -- fingers.  *Their* fingers, all twenty of them.  They had cut off their own fingers and were burying them in the back yard.  I don't even know how they were holding the shovels.

I watched them clumsily finish their work, which took almost half an hour.  When they were done, they glanced around again, and the husband looked right at my window.  I think they saw me, because they hurried inside the house, and then left in their car, burning rubber out of the neighborhood.

At this point all of the energy drained out of me and I fell into a deep sleep.

I slept through my alarm the next morning, so while I rushed to get ready I resolved to go to the police station after work in the hopes that my neighbors could be found and helped with whatever mental problems they obviously had.  On my way to work I saw from a distance a couple of pedestrians standing on a highway overpass.  At first I thought it might be my neighbors, but as I got closer I saw that they were dressed in long flowing robes, seemingly two sizes too big, made of white and red fabric, with matching red crowns.  They were both very pale, almost corpselike, and as thin as concentration camp victims.  As I passed under the bridge it seemed that they were pointing at me.

I was certainly shaken, but shrugged it off as a couple of weirdos (my city is a little strange and regularly hosts cos-play conventions) and put my focus on the traffic ahead.  I got to work on time, and started plugging away on my computer.  When 10 o' clock rolled around I got up for some coffee, and froze.  Outside the window, across the street, was the same couple from the bridge.  They were standing in the middle of an empty parking lot, holding hands and pointing up at me with their other hands.  *Jesus, they're following me* I thought, and ran.

I didn't even talk to my boss or tell anyone I was leaving.  I ran to my car and drove straight to the police station.  But when I was pulling into the parking lot up front, I saw them again.  In the precinct office, staring at me through the window.  *Shit shit shit!*  I peeled out as fast as I could and headed for the highway for the other side of town, driving well over the limit the whole way.  

There was no clear goal in my mind, just to get as far away as possible.  I began to fiddle with my lighter in my pocket to calm my nerves, and I started to zone out, not really paying attention to where I was going.

I ended up in a Wal-Mart parking lot when I came to my senses.  I wasn't sure what to do, so I parked the car and went inside.  As I wandered the aisles I had an increasing feeling that I was looking for something specific, but I couldn't place what it was.  Rounding the corner, I saw them again.  

The same couple, with their strange priestly robes and shining red crowns, with their pale waxy skin and gaunt limbs, standing in the middle of the Wal-Mart camping section.  No one else seemed to notice them.  I stood where I was, hyperventilating and twirling my lighter around in my hand.

The woman looked me in the eyes, then down at my hand, then back at my eyes.  I glanced at the lighter in my hand, which I had absentmindedly flicked on, and back at her.  She smiled, then looked over at a large display of camping stove fuel, matches, charcoal, and lighter fluid, and back to me.  *She wants me to burn down the store.*  The thought popped into my mind, seemingly from outside my head.

*No, no, this is all wrong.* I thought.  *I can't do this.  Fuck, I've got to get the hell away from here.*  I bolted for the door, knocking over merchandise, shoppers, and anything else in my way.  It seemed like I could see the couple behind every shelf, around every checkout stand, watching me with expressions of mild amusement.

And that's when I woke up.  Today has been fairly normal.  In reality I don't live next to a young couple, I don't work at an office job, and this dream seemed to have taken place in the summer, not March, so I don't know where this vision came from.  

Edit: On second thought they were dressed in robes much like those of [Cardinal Ravenwood](http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Cardinal_Ravenwood) ([another pic, right of center](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080908214522/metalocalypse/images/thumb/0/0b/Tribunal-s1-inset.jpg/621px-Tribunal-s1-inset.jpg)) from the show Metalocalypse.",nosleep,discontinuuity,/r/nosleep/comments/g1rgs/a_dream_i_had_last_night/
62,Never to be seen again,1299825347,"The following occurred during hurricane season in Texas. My university was closed due to the weather, and I went home for about a week. The first few days were fine, but then the storm hit. It was pitch black for two days, with the constant moan of the wind and hum of the rain. Trees had fallen in the area and winds were steadily gaining speed; everyone in the house was a bit on edge.

On the second night of the downpour, my girlfriend and I decided to sleep in the living room. We placed a mattress on the floor and tried to fall asleep. After a few minutes, we realized the couch was cramped up against us, so I got up to move it out of the way. I walked around the couch to the backside, between it and the wall. I knelt down to pull the couch toward the wall, but then I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. A person was walking slowly toward me from down the hall. A quick burst of adrenaline made me stand, but the shock caused me to freeze in place. When they finally reached me, I saw they had on what appeared to be a white t-shirt, but they lightly moved me out of the way and went to the kitchen. Calmed slightly, I wondered who would be up and about. I felt my way to the kitchen and turned on the light. After my eyes adjusted, I glanced in either direction; no one was to be seen. I stood there, bewildered for a few seconds, and decided my mind must be playing tricks on me. Right as I was about to turn off the light, my girlfriend asked, “Who went into the kitchen?” I responded, “What do you mean?” “Didn’t someone just walk past you?” At this point my heart began to race. Just to be sure, I asked her, “What did they look like?” She was a little confused by the question, so she said “Wasn’t it your dad, in a white shirt?” I knew I hadn’t just seen it; someone, or something, walked past me, and I did not know if they were coming back. I explained to her that all I saw was a white figure, it was dark and I couldn’t make out the face, but it pushed me out of the way to continue down the hall. Just to be sure, I went to my parents’ room; they were both asleep. They were the only other people in the house. We were both terrified that it would come back, unsure of what it wanted from us.  After about an hour of fearful glances and calming whispers, our nerves had settled and we decided we would try to fall asleep, looking forward to the safety of morning.
 
I haven’t seen the figure since, but I sometimes feel as if there is someone behind me, watching, waiting. A quick glance over my shoulder denies my suspicions, but I never know if the day will come when the figure is standing behind me, back to get whatever it wanted on that stormy night.

63,Creepy original content story (short),1299824949,"There once was child born into a demented family with uncaring parents and a sick demented brother. His brother always kept to himself and was always locked inside of his room. He always had a sneaky suspicion that his brother was a pedophile with his constant lurking around the elementary schools and eagerness to pick you up after school in his trashy shady car. He was only 6 and his brother had already dropped out of High School and lived in his parents house in seclusion. Whenever he left the confines of his musty room he always seemed overly nice to him. The older brother's only rule was TO NEVER ENTER HIS ROOM. The younger brother always wondered what was in it but never dared disobey his older brother.

On one fateful evening the police raided the house and at his parents horror he was taken in for possession and distribution of child pornography. Soon after being taken away curiosity got a hold of the youth and he entered the room. It was disgusting, smelly, and trash littered the floors. What caught his eye was a journal on the sweat stained cot which read in bold letters ""EXPERIMENTS"". In it described his fantasies about the sucking on young human skin and a sickening fascination with the nipple. Also in great detail it describes blood vessel activity and bruising, a lot about the human's heaviest organ; skin. But none of the horrors written in the journal could compare to the last couple of pages which the young child could make out clearly in the complex puzzle of scientific writings about the human anatomy. What he found to his horror was a picture of a man who was naked which showed his utter paleness and seemingly unhealthily bony body. If not for a few facial shots the child would have assumed it was an elderly man but it quickly found it was his own brother. From the pictures it seemed nighttime and well past his own bed time. In shock he saw in most pictures he was fast asleep and in every one of them he was always topless lying head towards the ceiling. On the bedside table was a jar of saliva and a towel which seemed unusually moist.
A day later his nipples faded away to blend in with the pigment of his own skin. ",nosleep,JustinJsen,/r/nosleep/comments/g1r5q/creepy_original_content_story_short/
64,I've always suffered with nightmares from a young age...,1299822601,"I’ve always suffered from nightmares from a young age. They always involve the same two dreams and the same horror in each one. The first one involves me laying in bed on no particularly special night. I open my eyes, it’s dark in my room but I have been sleeping for a while so my night vision is pretty strong. I can make out the various things in my room, the tower of my desktop computer, my desk lamp and chair sitting still and quiet on the other side of my room. Glancing at the clock, the time is always meaningless; 1am, 2am it doesn’t matter. I sigh and roll over, closing my eyes. Then I hear it – the quick click of a tongue on the roof of an unfamiliar mouth...at least it was unfamiliar years ago. I know now that I am dreaming, the ending of this dream is always the same yet inescapable – no matter how long I hold my eyes shut and pray to wake, I never do. I open my eyes and a foot from my face is a young girl staring right back at me. Her face is decaying and her eyes are black. I feel a heaviness take over me, my vision begins to twist and all I can hear is a deep moan – my consciousness trying to wake me up. It never goes farther than that. I wake up in my room, it’s still dark and it doesn’t matter what time it is. I never dare to roll over. 

My second dream shares the same beginning. I wake up in my room, its dark, only this time I need to use the washroom. I walk to the washroom, it’s always in whatever house I happen to be sleeping in that night whether it’s mine, my parents, friends or a girlfriends. I finish my business in whatever nightlight there is. I never turn on the overhead lights, they hurt my eyes so late at night. I look into the mirror, always so close for some reason, like I’m trying to find something on my face. I stare into my own eyes for a minute and suddenly my hands are pressing against the sides of my head. My eyes begin to turn black, my face begins to decay and my vision starts to twist. I hear the familiar clicking sound coming from behind the shower curtain but I can’t look away from myself...I’m changing. The same heaviness comes over me and I begin to scream, the scream isn’t part of the dream. It’s me trying to wake myself again.

I’ve struggled with these dreams for so many years and yet they never change, they never go away and I can never find meaning in them. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I just let her take me over, if I were to just let her in. Maybe one day I won’t scream. Deep down I know that when my number is up, when I finally release my last breath and depart this world...it will be in my sleep.

65,"Ely, Wisconsin Disappearances",1299819900,"The small town of Ely, Wisconsin is the town where I was born and raised. It is situated in the Northern part of Wisconsin near the Canadian border. Just North of the town is Miner's lake, and North of that Shagawa lake. The house my family and I lived in was on the Northern edge of town facing Miner's lake, in fact i could see the edges of it looking out our front window. A couple of months after Winter started in 1986, when i was seventeen years old, it was announced on the local News my third Grade teacher, Mrs. Weaver had gone missing. A massive search effort was launched, it went on for three months until it was decided she was dead. There was a ceremonial funeral and the town took a two day holiday to mourn her loss. On the second day of that Holiday Tim Harper, the man who worked the ticket booth at the theater went missing. Suddenly the entire town was on edge, we decided there was some kind of maniac on the loose in our small, previously peaceful town, and everyone suspected everyone else. Then the disappearances became more frequent, every couple of weeks someone else would go missing. The Police how no leads except that the people who were going missing had left their homes or work by themselves the last time they were seen. Parents warned their children, myself included, dozens of time not to go out after dark. I was the idiot who decided to be a daredevil, and i wish to any and all Gods that may exist i had not. Two weeks after Christmas I bundled up and went out into our front lawn and sat on the porch. Five minutes in and I was getting the chills, and not from the cold. Then I heard something crying, it sounded like it was coming from the direction of the lake, just barely out of site behind the trees at the end of our block. I ran inside, locked the front door, and then every door in the house, I was headed back to my room and as I passed the front door i heard the crying again, only now it was on the other side of my door. Not many houses in Ely have more than 7 or 8 windows, because of the cold, ours was one of maybe 13 houses in the community with a window on the door. All I saw was it's face, it's skin was blue but it didn't seem to fit on the thing, as if the skin was just sitting on a skeleton. That was not the worst part though. Running from it's jaw down the center of it's throat was a jagged cut, the cut was black around the edges and running along the inside of the cut were small, sharp teeth, dozens of them. And it was crying, it has black eyes and there were tears streaming down from them. I felt the urge to open the door, to let this poor thing in and try to comfort it, to make it stop crying. I had my hand on the doorknob and my thumb on the lock when I realized was i was doing and stopped. I almost fell trying to back away from the door and as soon as my hand was off the doorknob it started screaming. The glass on the houses windows cracked and vibrated. The noise hurt my ears it hurt my head, I started crying. I almost wanted to die just to get the pain to stop. Then, I blacked out. I woke up in Ely Bloomenson Community Hospital. I was told i was out for three days. My family thought the house had been vandalized as a prank and I had been hurt by the vandals. Shortly after the disappearances stopped and life started to go back to normal. This is the first time I have ever told anyone this story. Now I live in Miami Florida, every now and them I make a call up to some friends who still live in Ely, last I heard from them people were starting to go missing in a small town across the Canadian border.

66,Panic,1299817528,"Let me start off by saying I suffer from panic attacks.  They range wildly in length from five minutes to five hours (not an exaggeration).  Now panic attacks themselves are horrible but nothing new.  I know of plenty of people who suffer from them, but mine seem different, somehow.

A lot of the time I hear people describe panic attacks as they feel like they are going die.  That's not the case with me.  My rational mind is able to realize that these attacks are no threat to myself.  But that is where problems arise.  Panic attacks are the most irrational thing I do.  While I am able to occasionally to point out why they started, most of the time they just happen.

This is where it gets weird.  After I have my panic attacks I can only recall the vaguest of details and it feels like my mind is suppressing what really happens.  Let's say that right now I felt a panic attack coming on.  I would either A) sprint away from my computer to my bedroom (a good thirty feet and up some stairs) or B) melt out of my chair and find something to cower under until the panic attack ends. The more I think about why this is happening the more oddities come to light.  I remember a feeling of unbelievable dread.  It is like reality is dissolving around me.

I think I know why my mind is suppressing what happens before and during the panic attacks.  I believe I enter a realm where the veil of reality dissolves around me.  I see through, no, beyond the walls and dressers and feel a presence staring right back at me.  It is like that feeling when you are up late at night reading nosleep posts and know someone is just sitting behind you, watching you, just waiting for you to turn around.  Except it may case, if I focus on the presence it multiplies exponentially.  Soon I can feel thousand of eyes dissecting every single part of my anatomy, for who knows why.

I am an atheist.  But at the split second when my sanity and insanity meet, I feel as if there is something something beyond what I know about the universe.  Something about those unflinching gazes staring directly makes me hide in unbridled terror.  The worse part is, I have yet to feel those small black eyes ever remove themselves from me.  They just stare at me, waiting for something to happen.  I feel my next panic attack could be the last step they need in their plan to escape the confinement of their boundaries. I feel like there could be more information hiding just under the precipice of my thoughts and yet, as I said before, I can only remember the faintest of details.  Like those eyes.  Those thousands of tiny black beads watching me even now, just waiting.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g1oz1/panic/
67,Camping weekend,1299815020,"So I went camping with some friends last weekend, and for the first time, something odd happened. We headed up to Mount Kidd, which is pretty close to my city (Calgary) and there are some nice trails to hike and spend a relaxing 2 days close to the city. We were planning to stay 2 nights and 3 days, but some of my friends were a little too creeped out to stay.

Me and 2 friends, Jake and Rolson took an old RV down packed with a lot of beer and food. Our other 4 friends took a trailer and an RV down with us. Though this is not technically 'camping' it was much too cold for us to use tents...and what followed might have been too freaky in tents, so we're thankful for that.
I've been going to this camp site for a while with family and friends so it's pretty familiar territory. We found a good spot, and since it was the dead of winter we got a prime location in a spot I'd never camped before. The camp ground was pretty empty and the snow was completely untouched other than the odd animal prints and our own tire tracks. It was quite beautiful and it was so quiet and calm...that is, until we started getting rowdy with our drinks. 

Me and 2 others, Rolson and Amy decided to go for a hike almost immediately after we're all set up, because night was coming in quick. I picked a familiar trail and we agreed to turn back when we saw it was getting too dark because we aren't too experienced in hiking. We got a kilometer or two along the trail when we decided to go back to the camp site. As we walked back, it got very foggy to the point that we could barely see each other’s outlines, so we came close together and linked arms. The thing is- I linked arms momentarily with something cold and wet. I jumped back and just saw my friend puzzled as to why I went to link arms with what appeared to be thin air. I brushed it off as some sort of trick of my mind, and we all finally linked arms and started to walk a little quickly. When we talked about it later, we were all a bit scared and felt as if the wind on our backs was the cold breath of something dead. 

We were still about a 20 minute walk from the camp, and it seemed to be getting dark quite quickly because of the fog. That’s when I looked up at the sky in the direction of where the sunset should be and I saw the fog coalesce into a sinister face. It was shaped in a sneer and I couldn’t quite fathom what I saw, I just stuttered and asked if anyone else saw it. Rolson responded and said he saw a face, but he was looking in a different direction. Amy was panting heavily and she could barely whisper. She kept saying that she saw the outlines of people distantly in the fog. I didn’t see anything like that. I just turned my head to look straight up the path and that’s when I saw the outline of someone, I called out and the person stopped, but when we got to that spot, there was no one there. That’s when we started to all get especially creeped out, because we all heard (or imagined) footsteps all around us. The sound was quite rhythmic, and it got louder and softer. The fog was swirling now, quite quickly and not like anything I’ve seen before. We were practically at a run now, the wind whipping at our face and the patting of footsteps around us.

We had finally gotten back to the camp, but for some reason, the fire was out and the rest of the campers were all holed up in one RV. We didn’t know what was happening, so we went into the RV and our companions were all looking out the windows, and relieved we were back. They said that they saw faces everywhere and the fire just went out. They were also scared and went into the RV together to calm down. We told them our experience on the path and we all agreed this was nothing like we’d seen before. We ended up all sleeping in that RV overnight with a few candles and the curtains at the windows closed. We heard bumps along the RV and we heard the pitter patter of something or somthings outside. The next morning, we all get out of the RV and we find the snow looks completely untouched, even the tracks we left the day before were gone, and we knew it hadn’t snowed overnight because there was no snow on top of the RVs and cars. Me and Amy walked a bit up the path we had walked and the footprints we had left the night before were also gone. 

We stayed around a bit because it was broad daylight and we hung around cautiously cooking food and trying to enjoy the winter sun. Long before it was even starting to get dark we all packed up and got back to Calgary. I'm a little sad this happened because I love going to Mount Kidd in the summer...maybe this is just a winter phenomenon? Either way, this experience has ruined the calm ambiance that usually accompanied a trip to Mount Kidd.

69,A dance with insanity,1299813007,"I have always been sensitive to the paranormal, Hyper-Sensitive to be exact. I would get chills to the point of shaking sometimes when my friends and I would go on a paranormal excursion, and on certain cases so nauseous and dizzy that we would have to leave. So in fear of my own sanity, I would limit my paranormal exposure to reading books, watching movies, and etc. On one night tho, a few years ago, my parents were out of town for a few weeks, so naturally I was throwing a small contained party of about 10-15 people, all mostly close friends. Around 2:50 AM someone suggested that we should go on an excursion to an abandoned old sanitarium by our old high school, at first I was opposed to the idea, but being slightly intoxicated, and seeing that a girl (lets call her Meg) I really liked REALLY wanted to go, I decided that it should not be too much of a problem. I locked up the house and left with everyone down the street. After walking for about 30 minutes, we reach the end of the street, and come out on to a trail that leads us off on to the hillside, where the sanitarium sat on the top, overlooking the hill. Now before I being, here are some pictures for reference during the story, plus they are a good way to show you how creepy this place is exactly.

here are some videos of the place (not mine):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0e5JELMqY



By the time we get in sight of the sanitarium, I'm getting the chills so bad that the back of my neck was starting to go numb from all the tingling. We walk down the trail to the base of the hill, and it is decided that we play a game. Since we had an even number of 12 people at the time, we would split up in to groups of two and take turns going from one end of the sanitarium to the other. At the time if you look at the pictures of the place, the window on the far right of the east wing (right side of the building if facing the front) had it's plywood covers broken (same as the video in which the people enter through)  so we would enter through there, and progress up through the building to the opposite end, and shine a candle out through the last window on the top floor in the west wing (these were our only light sources aside from our lighters). Once the groups were picked out  we drew for spots, I was to be the 4th pair to enter the building. After some preparations (peeing in bushes, making sure everyone had a map of the place, etc) we began the game. As the first team crawled through the window, I started to get very uneasy, Something bad was going to happen, I just KNEW it. I stared at the dark windows of the sanitarium, they stared back. You all have probably heard the phrase ""Stare too long in to the abyss, and it stares in to you"" That was exactly what I felt, the building itself was looking at me, and only me. It was GRIMACING! I just knew it, I felt that at any moment it would laugh at my utter and complete terror, and the worst of all, I could not look away, It was like watching a horrible car accident.
By the time it was my turn to go, my head was pounding, I was not even in the building and my head felt like it was going to explode. Not wanting to show Meg that I was afraid, I did my best to ignore it, act as if nothing was wrong, I took her hand, and started to walk up the hill, with every step, I could feel the buildings grimacing smile grow wider and wider, It was waiting for me to step inside it's malice stained maws and swallow me whole. The walk up the hill was silent, at least on my end, I'm not sure if Meg was talking or not, all I could think of was what lurked inside the halls and cells of this decrepit building. When we got up to the broken window, Meg entered first, the metal mesh bars that were over it previously were bent at a weird angle, so if you were not tall enough, you would need a little boost to crawl on through, once she faded in to the dark little hole, I followed. Once I crawled through, I was surrounded by almost complete darkness, the only light source was the hole we crawled through, filling some of the room with a eerie moonlit lighting. We got our bearings together and lit the candle. The room was a little bit brighter, but not by much. we looked around, it seemed to be a fairly large and empty room, walls peeling and covered in vandalism and satanic phrases, decaying holes here and there, and Two gapping holes to the left of the room, that I would assume were doors. The first one on the left, seemed to be some sort of closet or something, walls long decayed and collapsed, leading off in to dark rooms, the door on the right led to the main floor hallway. We decided it would be safer and easier to see if we took the hallway, instead of crawling through holes. 


Upon entering the hallway, the walls on the right were all falling apart, we were able to see what seemed to be a maintenance shaft along the side of the wall, and the under works and foundations of the sanitarium itself. The the left there seemed to be an office or storage room of some sort, the walls were falling apart, rebarb sticking out in every direction, we could see through in to the room we came in. we continued to walk until we were in the center of the building, the floor above us had caved in, and moonight was falling in from the three huge windows from the floor above. In front of us the hallway seemed to continue by some more rooms, and an identical larger room at the end, but we decided to get upstairs and to the designated window to finish this stupid game. To get through to the stairs we had to go across the center of the room, under the giant gapping hole above us, to where the front door of the building is, then turn left, and walk up some cement stairs, this was one of the darkest place in the building, absolutely no light what so ever, aside from the candle in my hand. Each step up the stairs was dreadful, tho I was going up, my stomach itself felt like it was on a roller coaster, going down and down. As soon as we get up to the second floor, I could feel something was amiss, something was VERY wrong, I remembered how the building was grimacing at me earlier, when I first entered, I was more filled with adrenalin, and did not notice it, but as soon as I got up here, I knew it was not the building that was grimacing at me, but someone, SOMETHING. Meg's hand grips tighter around mine, and now I know that she is starting to feel something too, she tells me she is scared and wants to get this over with, she is actually on the verge of tears. I tell her we will be okay and that we should keep on walking. To the right of where we came out of, was a hall, full of fully intact and metal cell block doors, these were the high security cells, some doors where open some closed, it was very unsettling, as if someone was going to walk out of one of the rooms and look right at me. I decide to get away from here as soon as possible, we start walking to the left, and enter a huge room, in the center of this room, the floor was collapsed, it was the large hole we saw earlier, you could see in to the hallway, and certain parts of rooms. Again I got that feeling that something was watching, something with the intent to inflict despair,chaos, and fear... Something with the intent to kill me in the most unspeakable ways possible. I want to leave this room as soon as possible, everything now was starting to feel like a chase, My head was pounding, the ringing in my ears was getting louder, my stomach, did not feel like a stomach anymore, but a rock. In fear of me getting so dizzy I fall in the gapping void in the center of the room, I pull Meg along to the side of the room, where there was two doorways, one on the far left, and one and the right, conveniently you could go around the hole, by going in through the kitchen, so we did just that. after getting around the hole, we were finally at the west wing, and to my dreaded surprise, and identical hallway we saw earlier, full of high security cells, all mostly closed. All but one at the far end to the left, marked with a big X on the door. That was our location, we were supposed to walk in there and hold the candle out to show that we made it. Each cell we passed on the way there was horrifying, I was expecting to see some deformed creature or figure looking through the little meal slots in the doors with their cold dead eyes. Nothing. I was starting to get tunnel vision, by the time i made it to the end of the hall and in to the last cell, I sat down while Meg held up the candle and we waited for the confirmation shout that we were good to go. It seemed like I waited hours for it to come, and when it finally did, a sense of relief soon came over me. We were almost done, all we had to do was get out. Little did I know, that relief was soon to be gone, and what was in store for me, was the furthest thing from it.
I got up and took Meg's hand, she told me how she was so happy to get out of here, I told her that I can't wait to go hope, grab something nice and warm to drink and just go to sleep in my big and fluffy bed, she said she couldn't wait either and gave me a wink, but as soon as we left the room, that happy face of hers drained of color, her eyes widened, and her mouth opened in a silent gasp, I turn my head and look down the hall, my stomach dropped, I felt so sick that I felt if I even slightly opened my mouth, that I would spew. 


The doors that were close when we entered were now all open, even seeing down the hall, and across the big room in to the east wing, those were open too. Something was wrong. I feel the presence again, that intent of pure evil. Something was going to happen, something bad. and very very soon. I grasp Megs hand, and sprint, I am running at top speed, down the hall, I can hear each cell door slam shut behind me, with so much force the walls shake and dust comes down, by now the candle is out and gone, at one point I must have dropped it. As soon as I pass through the kitchens, across the large room, and in the directions of the stairs, I notice something out of the corner of my eyes, at the end of the east hallway, there was someone standing there, even tho I passed for a quick second, I knew, I knew that face was grimacing right at us, cold dead eyes staring right in to me. I run down the stairs pulling Meg along, I end up running in to the wall at the end, smashing my nose, regardless, I keep going, I was so close to the end. As I ran down the main hallway, I hear Meg scream, and I look up to the gapping hole above, and I see a flash of pale, I knew that he moved, down the hall, he was above the hole, looking at us, with his cold dead eyes. I was going to die, I just knew it, but I kept running, we made it back to the room we entered. As soon as we did, again, something was very wrong. The room was dark. Even without the candle the moonlight coming in through the hole lit it up. Then I realized, the hole, the hole is gone. No, there is something in front of the hole, There is someone one, That thing, It is in front of the hole. I'm dead, it is over I thought. I fell to my knees and accepted my fate. Then I felt what I knew what was coming, it was walking towards me, each cold dead step seemed to echo, My head felt like it was going to split, my face was hot and streaked with blood, Ears hearing loud ringing and the steps. I could not move, I was just as dead as it. I slowly lift my head, I look up, and it's cold dead eyes are looking right in to mine, it's smile so wide, and crooked, but just as empty as it's eyes, it knew it had won. I could hear Meg's screams in the distance, slowly, fading away, right before everything wen't black. At this point, I do not remember anything, I was told by my friends and by Meg that I got up and ran to one of the cells, and would not leave, I sat in the corner and screamed vile and crazy things, and eventually, after and HOUR, I just fell to the ground, and they had to carry me all the way home. I woke up almost 30 hours later. Thinking it was all a dream, until I saw how cut up my arms and legs were. It took me weeks to get over this incident, even now I don't think I have fully recovered, sometimes I will have dreams of that things empty sunken eyes, and cold dead smile, and wake up gasping for air, and not being able to go back to sleep, let alone leave my room.

71,something in the way she runs...,1299808022,"It was a long day at work, without even thinking i went through the mind numbing duties of an office worker, till that promised hour of 5pm hit the clock.
I still had some stuff to do around town that evening, so it was well after 8pm that i was on my way home.
Our town is very small. Only two streets mark the town really. It`s one of those places where everyone knows everyone and more. It was starting to get dark when i got to the highway. I was driving for about 15 minutes, when i spoted a woman standing at the side of the road, i stoped and turned the engine off, but when i looked up, she was gone. I waved her off, taking her as a figment of my tired imagination.
i started the car again, and continued on my way home.
it was now pitch dark, no cars or even lamps were present at this stretch of the road, complete darkness. I started to get this very uneasy feeling, like something wanted to harm me, instinctively i turned around, and there was that same woman, right behind my car. 
i almost drove in to a ditch when i saw here. i was going about 60 miles an hour and she kept on running behind me. Her body was moving in these very quick and jeky intervals. Panic was creeping up my spin like a cold wind, i was swerving all over the highway going well over a 100 miles /h by now, and still she kept on getting closer and closer. No matter how fast i was going she was right behind me. I was about 10 minutes away from home when she caught up with me and looked in to me side window. I froze with terror, for out of the corner of my eye i saw the wide green of a skull covered by a straw colored hair....then everything went dark.

73,Unexplainable events,1299805636,"This happened ten or so years ago.  I was thirteen at the time and I've been trying to make sense of it for years.  To preface, I am not, nor have I ever been, a believer in the supernatural or the afterlife.  Yet, this is an event so strange and unprecedented that I still can't shake it nor can I explain it.

My older brother and I were at the house alone, as our mother was out of town.  While he was watching television in the living room, I was in my bedroom on my computer.  My computer desk was in the corner of the room--the door was directly to the left of my desk (probably 10-12 feet or so).  As I sat at my desk, I noticed a figure in my peripheral vision, which then ran at me full-speed from the door.  The figure seemed to be hunched over as if it was preparing to tackle me.  Thinking it was my brother, I braced for impact and turned my head only to find nothing there.  I sat dumbfounded for a few seconds before immediately leaving the room, terrified.  I went to the living room and told my brother what happened.  He dismissed it and went back to watching TV.

After a half-hour or so, I gained enough courage to return to my room and to my computer.  A few hours went by without incident until I heard a loud crash from within my closet.  I opened the door to see that the Monopoly game I kept in my closet had fallen onto the floor and the game pieces were scattered everywhere.  Annoyed, I started to pick up the pieces only to realize that Monopoly was in the middle of a stack of two other games (Clue and Risk, to be exact) and all the games were pressed against the wall, meaning that it would be impossible for the Monopoly board to fall without the other two games coming down with it.  Additionally, I noticed a Monopoly $1 bill lodged in one of the gaps between the metal of an old BB gun I had in the corner of the closet.  I picked up the gun, removed the bill and tried to put it back in, but I wasn't able to:  the gap was too tight.  At this point, recalling the figure earlier, I left the room.  I watched TV with my brother for the remainder of the evening and said nothing to him about it, but it was horrifying.  I couldn't figure out what was happening.

Late that night, my brother went to bed and I (reluctantly) returned to my bedroom.  The Monopoly pieces were still strewn about the room as I had left them.  I put everything back in the box as quickly as I could and returned them to the top shelf of the closet before trying to sleep.  I recall lying in bed with the lights still on, trying to calm down before I attempted any meaningful sleep.  As I did, the book resting on my nightstand fell onto the floor.  The book was not at all near the edge of the nightstand and I couldn't explain how it happened.

Fed up and terrified, I said aloud, ""Please, stop.""  I stayed awake, afraid, for a few more hours before finally falling asleep.  Nothing else like that ever happened to me after that night, but I do recall our dogs acting strangely.  Sometimes, they would stand at one end of the hallway and bark viciously at the other end--I would always look, but never see anything.  Other times, they would cower behind furniture with their tails tucked as if they were afraid, even though they seemingly had no reason to be.

As I said, I've never been a believer in the paranormal or the supernatural, but this is something that has never left my mind.",nosleep,Aenimatic,/r/nosleep/comments/g1l76/unexplainable_events/
74,Snack Time,1299803592,"When I was about 4 I started going to this daycare center that had pre-K through 6th grade kids.  Our afternoon snacks rotated between graham crackers, apple slices, cheez-its, pretzels, cookies, etc…  so we’d have a different snack and a different kind of juice every day (and yes, I remember clearly even at that young age because it was a source of great excitement anticipating what snack it would be that day).

Every time we’d get the cookie snack, they were these chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies, I would take mine outside and—I remember the first time, it was like I couldn’t control myself—chuck it against the wall of the building so it broke into pieces and crumbled.  I felt so stupid afterward because I really wanted the cookie, what kid passes up a chocolate chip delicious cookie?  I’d never been a food thrower or had any rage problems like that, something irrational came over me...irrational even for a 4 yr old.  Another time it happened, I was in an angry rage about the cookie for absolutely no reason and I took it outside and stomped on it in the dirt.  One of the daycare teachers caught me and scolded me for wasting food and I was SO embarrassed and afraid she would tell my mom and I’d get in trouble.  So, it had become like a ritual for awhile, but after I got caught I was so embarrassed about my lack of controlling myself around these stupid cookies that I just avoided the snack time tray on cookie day.

I forgot about these incidents for awhile, and fast forward about 5 years til when I was in 4th grade, still going to the same daycare but in the “big kids” room now.  I overheard 2 of the teachers (one had been there since I was a kid, the other was a teenager who’d worked there for 2 years or so) talking about close calls with injuries, choking (and having to do the ‘finger swipe’), and other kinds of dangers various kids had been in over the years.  I vaguely remember them starting to talk about the place narrowly avoiding a lawsuit a number of years back, but their conversation caught my attention again when the older teacher, Ms. Vanna, started telling the teenager about how a few years ago some parents either hadn’t mentioned or didn’t know that their son was allergic to peanuts and he ate the chocolate peanut butter cookie snack and started gasping.  They thought he was choking at first, and couldn’t tell if there was anything in his throat, so while they called 911, a guy that worked there at the time tried to keep him alive by giving him CPR, but by the time the ambulance got there he had died.  The teenager and I were really wide-eyed by this point, totally shocked that this had happened there.   By this time it was obvious I was eavesdropping, but Ms. Vanna didn’t care and she was like “Remember?  You were here when it happened…he was in your class.”  But I was like nooo way, I would definitely remember that.  And she thought about it and was like “Oh right, I guess it was probably a few months before you started coming here.”

75,My friends mother still lingers,1299803463,"I have a friend that lives far out in the country in Fort Valley, GA. The property he lives on is a peach orchard and is extremely secluded, so as you can imagine, it's quite spooky at night.

I remember one time, we were sitting out behind his barn, staring at the stars, drinking some beers and talking. All of a sudden, we heard dozens of fast moving footsteps coming from the dark depths of the peach orchards and immediately realized exactly what it was. Dozens of coyotes that had been scouring the property for the last few nights were approaching us. We immediately slipped back into the barn chained the door shut and waited for morning. That's not the spooky part though.

My friends grandfather was the owner of the property and his daughter, my friends mom, had died when my friend was very young. They weren't too uncomfortable talking about it and ""yo momma"" jokes never seemed to really bother my friend. However, his grandfather decided to get drunk one night and tell me a story about how his daughter was coming back to visit him from beyond the grave.

Every night after we'd closed up and wiped down the dinner table, he'd go to lock the front door, and through the partially transparent curtains and through the garage, he could just make out the shape of a truck like the one his daughter had died in. The headlights were dimmed and he could make out a low rumble of an idling engine.

When this first began happening, he assumed it was a couple of corrupt former police officials he and his wife had put in prison several years prior and that they were here to strong arm he and his family. So he'd rush outside with his .38 service pistol and attempt to confront the intruder, but nobody was there, they'd just *vanished*.

For the first two weeks after this began happening, he'd rush out, pistol in hand and find nothing. Finally, he decided that it must be his daughter coming back to visit him.

It didn't end there though. One night, while I was asleep, my friend hears a low rumbling in the driveway right outside the front door and sees the silhouette of a truck, lights dimmed and engine idling. So he loaded up his lever action 30/30 and whipped open the door. The truck then sped around the corner.

He took chase, running through the backyard and into the barn where he looked out of one of the side windows. He watched the truck head towards the rental house down the dirt road and vanish into thin air. The eeriest part about all this, though, was that he never told his grandfather what he'd seen and his grandfather'd never told him.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g1kh8/my_friends_mother_still_lingers/
76,My Worst Dream,1299803238,"Unfortunately, this isn’t a story of me meeting a ghost, or my encounters with demons, or anything of the sort. It’s a dream that (luckily) I’ve only had a few times in my life. 

It’s a relatively simple dream. I don’t know how I get there, or where I am, just that I’m in nothingness. It’s a conscious nothingness though; I know that I’m in this void, even though my physical being is not. Everything around me is white. Not a nice, peaceful white either. It’s a whiteness that hurts my eyes, empty and devoid.
I can’t tell where it ends. It both feels like the nothingness is enclosing me in a tight box, and that it’s so massive in size that I’m the size of an ant in the universe. I can’t tell if the wall is an inch from my face or miles away. That’s usually when I begin to get scared.

After going through this dream before time and time again, I should know that there’s no one there but myself. But as always, like a movie whose actors always fall into the same traps, I try to cry out for help. I’m sure you’ve tried screaming before, right? Not only do you hear it, but you feel it as well, like a vibrating in your throat that burns and cracks. Somehow I know I’m making sound, but I can’t feel those vibrations, and no matter how loud I know my shrieking SHOULD be, no sound reaches my ears. 

I personally believe that sensory deprivation is among the worst of tortures one can put someone through, and that’s exactly what I felt. The heavy silence hurts my ears and no one is in the nothingness to hear my unspoken screeches for help. This is about the point that I get desperate for any sort of stimulation, anything that I can feel. 

So I’ll start to scratch open my arms. I want to feel the pain, and even though I’m physically injuring myself at this point, I’m still numb. I can never see my arms… for some reason I’m ‘there’, but I’m not. But when I break skin is when I get release, because though I can’t seem to see my arm in the nothingness, I can see the blood. It’s such a welcome break from the endless white that it only causes me to cause more harm to myself.

Usually I wake up shortly afterwards, and have often scratched my arms open from these dreams. The last scratch wounds on my right arm got infected pretty bad from trying to take care of it myself, since I didn’t want my mom knowing about the dreams. Eventually the wounds got to the point that they leaked pus and the scabs that covered them were a dark red/brown with green tinged in, and often soggy. It didn’t take much for the scab to just wipe off with a forceful movement. That was when I gave in and finally went to a doctor.

I still have faint scars on my arms; no one notices them unless I point them out. Despite how badly infected the wound had gotten, all scars fade, especially after a good five years, so sometimes even I get to forget it's there. I’m still terrified of the dream however, even after so long. So whenever anyone asks what I’m scared of the most, I always reply, “Nothing.”

78,I will forever avoid that stretch of road,1299800204,"I love the prairies. I think that most people don’t bother to spend enough time there to really learn to appreciate the beauty that’s all around. It’s a more subtle beauty there; a beauty of vastness, emptiness and sky. Unfortunately, all those things make it creepy as hell. Especially at night. 

One weekend some friends and I decided to go to the next town over to chill at another friend’s house, perhaps smoke some weed and get drunk. There was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary with this plan. Drinking is part of the prairie culture; it is what’s done on any given Friday, Saturday, or hell, even Wednesday night. Being the most responsible one of the group I decided to be the DD. I knew that I couldn’t trust anyone else to stay completely sober, so I bit the bullet. I also had to work the next day, which I thought was a convenient way to make sure everyone got back at a decent hour. 

God, I wish I could go back in time and get smashed that evening. I would get so drunk I would pass out. Refuse to leave the house. I would do ANYTHING to not have to get in that car and drive home. 

But I didn’t get drunk. I barely had a sip. By the time 1:30 rolled around I figured it was time to gather the troops and start heading home. It took until 3 to get going though. You know how it is with a group of well lubricated people who are having fun - sometimes it takes a little persuasion. 

To get home required a long 15 minutes of straight flat road, but growing up on the prairies, I was used to driving long stretches of abandoned highway. It is the only way to get from A to B. Even during the middle of the day I would usually find the road to myself, passing another car every ten minutes or so. But at night, it was dead. The chances of seeing another vehicle on the road reduced to almost zero. This night was no different. 

We were about three quarters of the way home and everyone was settled. Some were dozing, others still cracking jokes and laughing. I was not really paying attention to the goings on in the car – I was keeping a keen eye out for deer. They seem to almost want to get hit some days, and at night their numbers seem to multiply. Because I was being so observant I saw the glow in the distance right away. I thought it was just the eyes of a raccoon or some other small critter watching from the ditch, but as the car drew closer it grew brighter and bigger. Confused, I shook the passenger and pointed, my conspicuous movements gaining the attention of everyone else in the vehicle as well. Now it was hovering at eye level and seemed to be moving out of the ditch and onto the road. I slowed down to about 80 kp/h to get a better view of it. Just as the car got close enough to illuminatethe glow, I was distracted by a flash on the other side of the road, and a little closer to the car. My eyes darted over. My eyes grew wide. Standing on the side of the road was a child. Before I could react on that knowledge everyone in the car screamed, bringing my attention back to the original source of the glow. 

My eyes saw what they saw, but my brain didn’t want to believe it. Both my feet slammed onto the breaks and we skidded to a stop. There was no glow now. Instead, there was a corpse. A tall, thin, white corpse. Just standing there. In the middle of my lane. While my passengers were shouting surprise and fear, I couldn’t make a sound. Nor could I move my eyes off her.  She was . . . magnetic, I suppose. Beautiful in her own way, but very much dead. The rational part of my brain was thinking how everything about her was a cliché; her long straight black hair, her gaunt frame with deeply sunken eyes and her frilly white gown. But the part of my brain that was functioning, the panicked, terrified part wasn’t really thinking anything other drive, drive, move, run, get away, RUN! But I couldn't move. Here magnetism drew me, absorbed me, until there was nothing in my vision but her. 

She started walking. A jerky, uneven, yet somehow graceful movement that looked alien; as if her joints we in the wrong place or causing her much pain. As she made her way slowly across the road she carefully lifted her arm up and extended her slender fingered hand in front of her to the child that I had seen not two seconds previous. My eyes snapped off her and whizzed over to the child. I didn't want to see him. I knew he would be a shorter, even more terrifying version of her, but try as I might, I could not look away. 

The kid was about five or six. At first glance he looked the same as the woman, but then I looked in his ungodly eyes. While her eyes were just dead, the boy's eyes were deep and alive with swirling purple. There was nothing about those eyes that didn't scream evil.

As their hands touched, the sound of my fellow passenger's cries came rushing back to my ears, snapping me out of my trance. I quickly put the car in gear and slammed on the gas. I don't know why, but I looked in the rear view as we were pulling away and caught the gaze of the child, now in the woman's embrace. He was watching me. Not the car, but me. I could feel it, even through the distance and the mirror. And then he smiled the most blood chilling thin lipped smile.

Driving away I realized that that smile was the only time either he or she acknowledged our presence the whole time.

80,Unexplained Creepy/Monstrous Laugh,1299795586,"This story happened back when I was 15, so maybe being a kid contributed, but it thoroughly creeped me and my friends out.(Although that wasn't too long ago I suppose)

We had all grown up going to Catholic schools and it was during Lent. This meant that the local parish was having a fish fry. Basically it is just a get together where the adults stay inside to eat and drink while the kids would run around outdoors. We had grown up going to these, but me and my friends were the only kids who went anymore. We would sit around and shoot the shit, and if we got too bored we would get a little game of man hunt going, although that mostly turned into talking in a different location.
It was always very dark and we never saw anything strange while messing around. The only other people we ever saw were some older teens who would smoke pot near a playground, but that is on the opposite side of where this happened.
Anyway, one night it was getting late, around 11pm or so, and it was just me and 2 buddies left. Everyone else had gone home, adults included, and we were sitting under a light that was left on. This light was on the now empty(3 schools merged) grade school. We were just talking and it was a normal night. Then I heard a strange noise. I could hear leaves crunching and I just thought to myself that it was some people walking around, nothing odd. We kept talking and then I started to hear what I thought were voices. I assumed that it was merely some ghetto people who were talking loudly(I know that sounds bad but this wasn't the nicest part of town)The noise began to get louder and one of my friends, probably noticing the terrified look on my face, commented on the ""voice"" we were hearing. We could still hear leaves crunching off in the darkness, but it was now accompanied by a chilling laugh. It was rapidly rising and lowering in pitch. It sounded like what I would think of as a hyena laugh. I'm not sure if that is an animal that everyone has the same sound for, but if you know what I'm talking about, you can understand why I didn't like it. As it got louder and louder me and my friends looked at each other and all took off running at the same time. This scared us enough that we ran about half a mile before we stopped. Nothing had followed us but we were all extremely frightened. We walked the rest of the way to my friends house talking about what the laugh could have been. Every noise made us jump. When we talked to our other friends about it none of them believed us. I know this isn't necessarily the scariest story to read, but to me, nothing has ever scared me more. Nothing should ever be able to make the noise we heard.

Now my question for the rest of you is this; have you ever experienced a strange laughter? Any links to a video that has something similar to what I described? I can still hear the laugh in my head but I haven't found anything that matches the noise no matter how hard I look.

81,Forgotten Photographs,1299794919,"We held on for as long as we could, but it was barely a year before we all agreed that it was time to move out.  Walking past the closed door to that empty room had become unbearable.The task of packing things up and getting them out of the house was largely left to me.  Even 13 months later, my parents couldn't bring themselves to go through any of the old things that might have reminded them of her.  I could do it, but just barely, so I ended up responsible for my sister's room.  To be honest, I had originally planned to just put everything in a garbage bag and throw it away.  I don't think that even I could have handled doing anything more complex.  It seemed to me at the time that the best thing for all of us would be to try to forget her.  This might seem callous, but it wasn't exactly a subject about which I could think very straight at the time, and I have trouble with it even now.So I went into the room, eyes fixed on the carpeting.  The first thing I encountered was a child-sized pink suitcase which had been left here the last time the door had been opened, when the three of us came back from last year's vacation.  And on top of it, a plastic bag, filled with souvenirs:  that keychain she had bought at some tourist-trap aquarium; a postcard from some side-of-the-road museum of oddities - and an envelope full of pictures.  I could still vaguely remember them - the trip was planned to be two weeks long, but we had already used a whole roll of film by the time four days had passed.  We had them developed at a 1-hour photo place a mile off of Highway 70.  We were going to show them to my Aunt Roberta in Kansas City when we got that far.  We never did.  Against my better judgment, I opened the packet and started leafing through the pictures.  The first time, all I could see was her- pigtails and a gap-toothed smile.  I didn't notice anything strange until the second go-round, when I started to see the thing that made me sit down hard.  We hadn't looked at them that closely the first time, since the memories were still fresh in our minds.  That, most likely, was the reason I was the first to notice it.  But a third look through the pictures confirmed that, in the background of every single one, through a window or in a grove of trees, was the same man, always looking directly into the camera.",nosleep,Delgarus,/r/nosleep/comments/g1hhu/forgotten_photographs/
82,He took his hat and jacket,1299794009,"Okay this happened to me my freshman year of high school (I am now 25). I didn't tell many people because I didn't want to seem like an attention whore or a nutcase.

The reason I decided it needs to be posted is because after reading a lot of nosleep, I realized that as rare as it is to read something I really feel writers believed happened, I too am one of those people.

So, I asked my best friend, an atheist like me and someone who is studying science, if anything ""weird"" has ever happened to her. She could tell by the look on my face that I was dead serious and I needed a thoughtful answer. She had nothing, but listened to my story. I then started doubting myself; maybe I made it up, maybe I thought it happened and embellished it to make it more believable so it would sound cooler out loud. This was about a week ago. I started to think I was full of shit, so I called my mom and she confirmed it happened. 
**I am writing this because I want people to know they aren't crazy and they aren't alone. **
---
My mom and dad got divorced and my mom decided to buy a house. While we were moving in, the neighbor came over with cookies to introduce herself and make us feel welcome; she was a single mom too. My mom and her hit it off and the lady ended up telling us about the person who owned the house before. Really nice old lady whose husband had died about 9 months before and she was too old and weak to take very good care of herself, so her kids put her in a nursing home. 

The house was cool, and it was clear by the wallpaper and color scheme that this was the home of old people. My room was in the basement, it was semi-finished. The room next to me was the pool room with really sweet dark finished wood panels. The windows were tiny and it was kind of dark and dank, seemed like it had a bar in place at one point in the corner and clearly had been smoked in. 

Next to that was a huge windowless storage room, turned closet. Mind you when the old lady moved out, random things got left in the house, weird kitchen utensils, tons of stuff in the garage, a broken lawn mower, and downstairs in that closet was an old jacket, worn leather belt and a sweet hat, kind of looked like a fedora. Well I was stoked, I started wearing that belt immediately, it was MY belt. It was fucking beautiful, looked like the old man had worn it out just perfectly and it fit.

The hat and jacket, we left it there, just thought it was kind of like a historic monument. We heard the man was a really nice gentlemen and we could just tell this house had a lot of love in it. My mom is really into spirituality so she had the house blessed and I just kind of giggled and shook my head. They ended up spending a lot of time in the pool room, which made sense, it was a little creepy or eerie I should say. 

Flash forward about a month. I started spending a lot of time redecorating. My mom was never home but when she was we would make dinner and hang out. We were close at the time. She said I could decorate the basement however I wanted, and it became clear to me that the basement had been the old man's domain. The corner across from my room had a workshop bench and some really sweet tools, a really nice giant freezer to store meat in (BACON!), a few closet/storage areas, and the pool room, then my room... I have no idea what was there before. I took over the floor. I crafted on the bench, removed the wallpaper and painted the walls, fixed some broken electrical stuff in the pool room and made myself at home.
Then it happened one night. 
I always close my door, always. I can't sleep with it cracked open or whatever, fuck that. So I was laying in bed and its that time of night when the darkness has just stopped peaking and the light starts to come back, but really subtle, this blue glow that almost seems as though you might just have developed the ability to see in the dark. I wake up in my bed and my eyes are still foggy, I feel as though someone is trying to get my attention. I notice my door is open all the way and that's when I see it, an older man's figure in my doorway. 
Here is the difference between my story and the ones on nosleep.
I wasn't scared, and he didn't want to scare me. I could feel his emotional state, almost like he communicated through emotional vibrations. I could feel he was saying goodbye and he approved of us living in his house. I fell back asleep.
In the morning my mom comes down and wakes me up. She says, ""Hey, did you notice anything weird last night?"" She seems a little wigged out.
I say, ""Yea the old guy who was watching the house said goodbye."" 
She, being the spiritual one, seemed totally shocked. 
""Yeah, exactly! He came in my room and just stood at the foot of the bed and the cat tried to rub against him and then he left. I wasn't scared, I felt calm, but now I am a little shocked. I felt something in the pool room but I never thought he was still here.""

The next time I looked, his hat and jacket were gone, but the belt remained.

I don't remember anything else about it. I don't know why, as a non-beleiver, I wasn't shocked, but I have been known to bury my feelings, and pretend things didn't happen. But maybe because it was such a calm, positive experience I just kind of shrugged it off. I did feel more privileged to wear that belt and I wore it until it broke. I sewed it back together and it hangs on my wall to this day. 

So, flash forward to now. Reading nosleep at 2am trying to get too wigged out to sleep, that cold chill down my spine and the fear of the unknown in my soul and I can't. Maybe it is because I have only felt the presence of someone who was loving and kind. I thank my stars for that but then I wonder, with all the hate and war, tragedy and sadness in the world, was I one of the lucky ones?

There was a story posted on here about a girl who had been living with a psychopath. He had made threats of some sort to her Mom about a man in a cowboy hat and the things he would do to the OP. The story didn't leave a huge impression on me, but the other night it invaded my dreams.

I was having a really normal dream and all of a sudden, I turned my head and saw a man standing there with a cowboy hat on. Whatever I had been feeling in the dream was immediately replaced with pure unadulterated terror. I stared into his eyes for a good ten seconds, and started screaming.

When I woke up, I realized that I had been gasping for air for some time. I just moved into my own apartment, so I had to take a couple of seconds to get my bearings together and realize where I was. My heart was racing and I was sure that this man in a cowboy hat was somewhere, watching me.

86,"""Everything I love is dead""",1299780344,"The desiccated bones of a dead bird are lying in a small heap on the desert ground. There are a few dusty black feathers that have not yet been blown away by the wind entangled in the bones. They make me think that the skeleton I’ve been staring at once belonged to a Crow. I have a feeling the bird has been dead for a long, long time, but places like this have a way of destroying things quickly, so it’s possible the corpse has been here only for a 
few days, or maybe even just a few hours.
 
As I’m considering this, the wind picks up, howling across the expanse, dislodging some of the feathers from their resting place and carrying them off into the void. Soon there will be nothing left, for as the driving wind whisks 
away the feathers, so too will the shifting sand swallow the skeleton. For that, I am sorry because I have this strange sensation like this crow and I have something in common. It may be that we are both lost and doomed to be 
forgotten, but I feel like there is more to it than that. While I stare into the empty eye sockets I realize why people are really scared of death. It is not because they don't know what happens next. The real question is: if we 
have immortal souls, why don't we remember anything that has come before we are born? Since living things have no recollection of a before then the odds that we will have a recollection of an after seem, well, very bad.

Existence is over in the blink of an eye, and when it's gone, it may be gone for good. But what if this Crow did have a soul, does it even know it was ever here? I am thinking that it probably does not, which seems to make perfect sense and no sense at the same time. 

I can’t stand here forever, but I have not found the strength to move on yet. My mouth is parched and I feel as if I may die of thirst, yet I have an odd, irresistible urge to spit. What little liquid I can muster is quickly sucked up by the dry earth, leaving only a small, damp outline where the drop landed. In seeing this, my outlook changes slightly. Maybe I am too pessimistic. Maybe there is something that was before life and remains after death. An outline. A thought. A feeling. Something. Maybe all that is left is a memory that there was a memory. 

A memory that there was a memory? A memory that there was a memory? The line is stuck on repeat in my head. It's like there is a revelation that should be coming, but it isn't. A memory that there was a memory? I have successfully scared myself. Once I look away from the Crow, and my dried spit, I am able to push the thought out of my head. I'm hoping the memory of this mental breakdown will be forgotten quickly.

I want to start walking again. I know that I was headed somewhere, but can’t recall the name or place. I also can’t remember which way I was heading when I stopped to look at the Crow. I slowly scan my surroundings. Nothing. All that can be seen is the seemingly repeating pattern of a vast stretch of cracked dry clay. Since it is all the same, and I know it’s likely I’m going to die of either starvation or desperation, I pick a direction at random. One foot in 
front of the other, I begin my march to the horizon. 

It is only desert, desert, and more desert. I walk for longer than I think is possible, and then the desert is gone and I am in a town. I don't remember seeing the town, I don't remember walking into the town, I am just here, and I 
know this is the place I needed to get to.

Although I can see no signs of ghosts, the town has a haunting air about it. There isn't much left. Most of the structures are either burned-out shells or the walls are crumbling from old age. One by one, I explore all of the buildings that seem safe enough for me to enter and even venture into a few that seem like the slightest breeze would cause them to collapse. I have yet to see a single sign of life. This place is nothing except a remnant of a time forgotten. There is an eeriness hanging in the air that is nearly as suffocating as smoke. I want to leave. I would rather be back in the desert than to spend one more minute in this dilapidated town, but I keep looking because I have to. 

When I get to the center of town I see a beautiful young woman. You would think the sight of another human being would be cause for joy, but the girl is laying on the ground, spread eagle, and completely naked. I approach with caution, sure that this is some kind of trap. As I draw closer, I see that she is crying.

She has not yet seen me so I take the time study her. Her gorgeous flowing black hair is in perfect contrast to her perfect pale white skin. Her arms, legs, and neck, have thick, rusty shackles around them. The shackles are attached by a short length of chain to steel posts that have been driven into the ground. Being bound in this manner, the woman cannot move more than a few inches.

There are no signs of other people, so I move closer still. The woman must have sensed my presence, or heard the dirt cracking beneath my boots. Her head turns towards my direction and she looks directly into my eyes. Even though she is crying, I do not see fear or pain, instead I see ... pleasure?

It is as if my soul has been lit on fire. Her eyes are locked on mine and she is probing my thoughts. Our minds meld into one another. She speaks to me without speaking, and I speak back without speaking. The conversation happens in a split second, and yet it seems to take forever. Everything is shared and known, but I can only comprehend a select few words of meaning.

You are alone. 

Yes. We are both alone. 

If you free me we won't be alone anymore. 

But why did the town leave you? 

Because everything I love is dead. 

I don't understand. 

Everything I love is dead. 

I am sorry. I am so, so, sorry. 

Will you free me? 

Please, before I free you, I must know what happened 
here.

She transmits the feeling that she has been here waiting for someone for longer than anyone living could possibly understand. I wish I knew what the the town folk were thinking. How could they have left her here like this? Her memory flashes in my mind. Eons ago, when this nameless town had a name, those evil spiteful people chained an innocent girl to the ground because of their illogical and outdated beliefs. 

""Witch"", they cried. ""Witch!""

All of them thought the town was cursed by her, so they abandoned it, leaving it to to rot in the desert sun, and they left the poor girl to rot along with it.

Now that you know will you free me?

I answer by prying the stake which is holding down her right leg out of the ground. As her leg is freed, she changes. The change is almost imperceptible, yet still noticeable. She is so very beautiful, but somehow less innocent. There is an ominous look in her glimmering eyes. I wonder if she isn’t a victim at all, but she banishes the thought from my mind. Those who had done this to her must have been evil. Of course they were. She is the one in need of help and it is my duty to free her.

I pull the second stake, freeing her left leg, and she changes again. This time her shiny black hair fades to a dull gray. Her smooth, porcelain skin becomes worn. In a matter of a few short seconds she has transformed into something disgusting. Decay on decay. I know now that she was the one who destroyed the town.

Witch! Damned Witch! You are meant to be here!

Please free me.

This time it isn't a request, it is a demand, and I have no choice but to listen. I do not want to, I try to fight, but she has a power over me. I pull the third stake from the ground, freeing her left hand. Its appearance continues to change as each binding is removed.

My god, what are you? 

I am Romans. 

You can't be. 

I am. 

It isn't possible. 

Free me. 

No! 

It smiles, if cruelly curling bleeding lips over rotting, sharp, yellowed broken teeth can be called a smile. I expect it to ask me to free it again, but it says nothing else; it doesn't need to; I had done enough. It reaches over and pulls out the stake holding down its right hand. It changes again into something dark and shapeless. A thought of the dead crow flashes in my mind. The thing then rips off the collar that was holding its neck to the ground. With the last bind broken, its true form is now reveled as pure evil that cannot even be described.

It rushes at me.

I run. 

I run as fast as I can.

It is laughing.

It is gaining.

It is so close behind me now.

I can feel the thing's breath at my back. I push myself to go faster, and faster still, I think there is hope. A memory of a memory. And suddenly I know the truth.

THERE IS NO HOPE.

It has me.

It has always had me.

Sudden Darkness.

Meaningless Darkness.

Eternal Darkness. 

I feel like there is this important memory I once had. I don't know why, but I stop walking. I see the desiccated bones of a dead bird lying in a small heap on the desert ground.

88,I saw it coming,1299776714,"This isn't a confession. You can't prove a damn thing, so don't even try. I'll deny it to my grave. I'm on my third drink for the evening anyways. You can't trust the word of a drunken man.

That's when I start to feel anything these days, the third drink. Sometimes it takes four, but usually three will do. It's the same cycle every night for weeks now, I drink, then I start to feel, then the fear comes over me, then I drink some more until I pass out.
 
Wake up, slog through the day. Keep my head down, keep my chin up, don't draw anyone's attention. Go home, repeat.

One night a few weeks back there was a man at my door. I answered it, wondering what in the devil he was doing there at that time of night. I live at the end of my street, and there's no one around for quite a ways, and even the evangelicals that comb the neighborhood rarely make it all the way out to my house.

“Help me,” he gasped, his blood-flecked lips quivering in the rain. His forearm was badly broken, bits of bone sticking out through the skin. He was pale and drenched, the rain and blood dripping steadily from his haggard frame, pooling on my porch beneath him. “There's been an accident, I need help,” he winced. “Can you help me?”

I nodded, dumbly, shocked at his state, then ran inside looking for my cell phone. But by the time I got back to the door with it, he was gone, the only sign of him a trail of splattered red leading down my front steps and out into the front yard.

I stood there, shocked for a moment. And then I put the phone away, slammed the door, and locked it. I don't know why, I was just scared, frightened by the whole affair. And some part of me, some damned selfish part of me, kept saying it's ok, it's someone else's problem. He's gone, forget about it.

So I poured myself a drink to ease my nerves. And then another. A few drinks later, I had forgotten all about him. And a few drinks after that, I'd drunk myself to sleep.

I woke up with my head throbbing. I'm not a heavy drinker. Well, used to not be one anyways. I stepped outside and noticed that there was no blood on my porch and breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe the rain washed it all away, I thought. Or maybe it hadn't happened at all. I went to work nursing my hangover, but I made it through the day. Came home, tried to relax.

I'd slept poorly the night before and my day took what energy I had left, so I decided early in the evening to call it a night. I was just about to go bed, when there was another knock at the door.

I froze, looking over to it. My heart raced. I tried to laugh off my rising fear. It was just someone at the door, nothing to be afraid of. But as my hand reached for the knob, I heard his voice, the same quaking shudder of a voice from the night before. “Help! I need help!”

I stood stone still as he pounded on the door. “God, it hurts!” he shouted. “Please! Why won't you help me??”

I put my back to the door, bracing it, squeezing my eyes shut. This isn't real, I thought. It can't be. And after a few seconds, the knocking stopped and it was quiet.

I flung open the door, but there was no one there, no trace of blood or sign of his presence.

Unsettled, I shut the door, locked it, and reached for a bottle. 

And so it went, for four more days, each night the same, the knocking, the horrible man at my door, the cries for help. And each night, I secured the door and waited until it stopped, then drank myself into oblivion.

By the seventh night I'd had enough. I made a stiff drink as soon as I got home, and then another after that one. I had thought of nothing but the events of the previous week that day. So naturally I was anticipating the knocking when it came again that night, confirming my paranoid fears. I was waiting for it.

I threw open the door upon the first knock, and there he was, battered arm hanging limp at his side, pale face twisted into a grimace. But before he could say anything, I leveled my shotgun at his face and pulled the trigger. His head popped like a blister, and I fired a second time, blowing his arm clean off and leaving a hole in his torso. 

Covered in his wet viscera, I shut the door. I want to say I was in a trance, that I was on auto-pilot and out-of-my-head, but that's not true. I knew exactly what I was doing. I was trying to make a point to myself.

See, I'm a level-headed man. I don't believe in ghosts or the supernatural or anything like that. We live in a rational world. And I damn well wasn't going to sit back and let my head play tricks on me without fighting back.

They say blood is hard to wash off, but it's not true. His blood washed right off of me. One shower later, I was good as new. So when I finished cleaning up and calming down and went back to the front door, I likewise expected there to be nothing there, as there had been no trace of him left from the previous nights.

I couldn't believe it when I opened the door and his remains slumped inside like a sackful of meat. I reached down and poked the corpse. It was solid. The porch was covered in blood and gore. Once more I panicked, and this time I did go into a sort of trance. The hours passed in a blur as I drug the body around to the back of the house, dug out a shallow grave, cleaned off the porch as best I could, and took another shower.

And then I made another drink. Tomorrow, the knocking would come again, I was sure. I hadn't just killed a man and buried him in my backyard.

When I got home the next evening, I sat and waited anxiously. Any moment, the knock would come, the man would again be at my door, waiting for me, asking for help. Maybe tonight I'd laugh, invite him in, ask him if he wanted a drink, I thought, sipping my own drink nervously. The minutes stretched out, and it felt like I'd waited an eternity when it finally came.  The knocking.

I breathed a sigh of relief as I rushed to the door, but it wasn't the man from the previous nights. It was the police. A car had gone off the road the night before. They wanted to know if I'd seen anyone. Maybe it was my drunken state that allowed me to lie so convincingly, but after telling them I knew nothing of it, they bid me a good evening and left.

My pulse pounded in my head. This couldn't be happening, I thought. It wasn't real. The thoughts piled on, one by one, and all I could do to quell them was keep drinking until I lost consciousness.

I called in sick the next day. I checked my backyard, and sure enough, the grave I'd dug was still there, still fresh. I dug him up, burned the body until it was ash. When I was done, I went back inside the house and numbly sat down.

And since then, I can't feel anything. Not until I drink. Usually three, sometimes four. And it's only then that I start to feel it – the fear.

See I'm not afraid of ghosts. I don't believe in them. I've never believed in them.  Probably in part because I was raised by my heavily superstitious mother. She made her living as a psychic, telling fortunes. She claimed that she had “the sight,” that she could see a person's fate before it happened, and she had a steady stream of gullible clients that kept a roof over our heads and food on our table. So I didn't make a big deal out of it, but like any kid, I rebelled against her and her beliefs. And when I left home, I found plenty of support for that rebellion.

Psychics aren't real, right? No one can see the future. Right?

Cause now I'm afraid my mother wasn't faking it, that she really could see the fate of all those people who came to her. And I'm afraid, I'm so terribly damn afraid, that now I can see it too.",nosleep,ioptah,/r/nosleep/comments/g1agl/i_saw_it_coming/
89,Alien Dream #27,1299776542,"I am a fighter pilot, flying through a storm and I don't know why. There is a picture of a family I do not know taped by an altitude meter; two girls hugging my wife and a son missing a leg looking away from the camera. I feel like I love them. Dense clouds lift above me as I descend below them to watch lightening stretch the miles down to black sea. The sterile whir of engine thrums through my ears and seat. It rattles the red handle to my right for the ejector seat. I hear a voice in my helmet.

""Just--....no time. It's coming for you....--next.""

I am not afraid. Then seven blue lights appear to my left, in a halo, gently illuminating the roaring cumulonimbus. There is a solid thick form inside it, spinning fast. Lightening strikes and I see a thousand peaks of cathedrals rise on the curve of a giant machine lifting from the ocean. I think this is hell, punishment for the accident. Punishment for my carelessness and the leg it took from my boy even though he does not exist. My chest feels like an anvil is crashing through my sternum. I believe this is real. I am seeing the impossible. The rape of gravity. God crushing an innocent child in his raised fist to drink its blood. I am completely afraid. 


The halo of lights wobbles, and crashes into my plane. The wing is gone. I am spinning, the rain coursing through the cracked windshield like a needle to sting my face. The ejector seat handle is still rattling. I pull it, and it pulls my spine out through my back.

There is a loud hiss and shatter. I am free, tumbling in the air. The ship above me explodes. Glass cuts my arms. When the chute opens I am drenched and falling fast. The ocean opens its jaws for me in the staccato light produced by the positrons in the aftermath of lightening. I do not not why I think this and that scares me, too. I am dropped into a wet valley and a mountain of water slams into my side. The parachute lands on me like a jellyfish, heaving with the waves to strangle me with its tentacles. I struggle out of its bloom and float upon the shifting mountain range.

And then there is a splash.

First, I think shark. But I know that is wishful thinking. I hear it thrashing wildly and paddle around to watch. There in front of me is something I have not seen. It moans, like the sound of two galaxies grating together to laugh at me. It is shaped like a deer, only its body is completely solid, no legs--just a massive hunk of flesh with a head attached to a flailing neck. It is flopping over to me, slowly, and I cannot get away. My heart gives up, deciding to die rather than watch that things flat teeth eat me alive while its body pounds me over and over. 

I think it will take my leg first. That is what I deserve. 

The thing leaks neon blue, spurts it on my face, paints its target. Its screams are higher pitched now and I feel its excitement seep into my skin, convert to paralysis and a fear so deep my bones splinter. I am afraid not because I do not know what will happen, but because I do. The saw the paramedic used to hack my sons leg free from the smashed car. Those wide eyes looking at me for help while I do nothing--don't even hold his hand. I look up to God and he is not there.

But then there is a light. That machine is over us and we are being lifted. I think, maybe this creature is God, and that is the worst. It knows me and will seek retribution for my sins. I slide through rain drops to its trumpet mouth, my leg extended, eyes wide open.

And then I awake.

91,Why I hate the cold,1299753885,"This story happened to me 6 or 7 years ago. I was working as a night auditor in a hotel. For those who don’t know what a night auditor does, it’s basically a normal hotel desk clerk job but with some accounting tasks thrown on top. Saying I was a night auditor is kind of reductive though. I was the only employee in the Hotel all night long and was basically doing every job needed: house maid, security, etc. 

My shifts usually started a little before midnight. I had to go around the hotel and lock some outside doors, check for any stuff forgotten in the hallways, turn off some lights, etc. Just making sure everything around the building was fine. It became a very well-oiled routine I did at the beginning of every shift. Our hotel had 3 wings spread on 4 floors, plus a basement.

I’d start by going up to 4th floor where we had some conference rooms. I’d do a little bit of clean up, check if some coffee machines hadn’t been turned off, throw away any food still laying around, turn the lights and lock the doors. Then I’d go down to the 3rd floor where hotel rooms were located, go through all the hallways and lock all outside doors at each end of the wings. Then I’d go down to the 2nd floor and do the same. Then to the 1st (main) floor and do the same. I’d always finish with the basement, where we had more conference rooms. Again, same deal: check for coffee machines, food, turn off the lights and lock the doors.

One of those conference rooms in the basement was pretty creepy. It was a long, rectangle room that had almost the same 70’s-style carpet as in The Shining. I love the Shining, so I always had a weird love-hate relationship with that conference room. Anyway. 
Our hotel shared a part of the building with a restaurant. The restaurant’s basement had a door connecting to a hallway that was adjacent to that particular creepy conference room. So there was big accordion doors at one end of the conference room so the restaurant employees could access it; and on the other end there was our (the hotel) door so we could access that room. The point was that people who came to conferences in that room could order lunch at the restaurant; and the restaurant could come bring the food almost right out of their kitchen. 

The restaurant was always closed when I was beginning my shift; so naturally, their accordion doors were always locked. The problem was that the stupid architect who designed that building had placed the fucking light switches beside the accordion doors. So I had to go in the room through the hotel’s door, walk all the way to the other side of the room to where the light switches were, and turn them off. Then I was stuck in total darkness, save for whatever little light visible through the hotel’s door frame. That lighten door frame looked awfully tiny from across the room. Many times on my way back I tripped on some electrical cord duck-taped on the floor; or bumped hard on the corner of a table. Partially because I couldn’t see anything in the dark, but mostly because I was always in a hurry to get the fuck out of there.

That was really just the only creepy part of the hotel. Sorry, I know, it’s maybe disappointing. There wasn’t any creepy pictures on the walls. Not even creepy stories about the hotel, like people who had died there or whatever. Well, some people have died there. Nothing creepy though. Just people found dead in their beds by the maids in the morning. Might sound scary to some, but it’s really just normal life. Ask anyone that works in the medical field or in some retirement homes. People die in their sleep quite often. Hotels aren’t an exception.

There was ONE thing that I found kinda weird though. On the 3rd floor, in the west wing of the hotel. There was a specific section of the hallway that kept me guessing. Whenever I’d do my round at the start of my shift and walk by that part, I’d always get the sensation of walking through a pocket of cold air. It was always around the same part of the hallway, in front of rooms 350, 352, 354 (hey, I even remember the room numbers!). That hallway was solid concrete, and there were only rooms on one side (even numbers) because the other side was part of the restaurant I mentioned before. 

The pocket of cold air was weird. It was standing about 2½ feet above the floor, and was maybe 1 feet wide and 2 feet deep. I would always walk in that hallway in the same direction, and every single time, around that part, I’d walk through that pocket of cold air and just *feel* it. Whenever I tried to turn around and walk back through it, it was gone. Whenever I walked there later in the night, it was gone. It was only there at the beginning of my shift, when I was walking in that same direction through the hallway.

There was another guy doing the same job as me (hey, I had to have off days!) and I asked him if he ever felt that same weird pocket of cold air. After talking with him, he told me he was doing his round very differently and never really noticed anything. We came to a very rational conclusion. It was probably just cold air that would come in when I would go out and lock the outside door at one end of that hallway. It was a draft that would just get somehow “stuck” in the hallway. 

That was pretty much the end of my questioning. From then on, I’d just do my rounds as usual, walk through the pocket of cold air, as usual; and not think a thing about it anymore.

Until one night, when I was in that creepy conference room in the basement. I had just turned the lights off and was making my way back in the dark, eyes fixed on that tiny rectangle of light at the other end. 

Suddenly, that door fucking closed shut. I got startled and froze, standing still in complete and total darkness. 

Then I felt *it*. The familiar cold air. This time, *it* passed through *me*. Slowly, deliberately, knowingly. Every hair on my body stood up.

I was in absolute darkness with that cold *thing* gliding around me.

93,Story of my UFO sightings.,1299743819,"I'm not sure how frightening you may find UFO's, but I feel utterly creeped out by them. Anyways, here's some stories of my sightings.

On the way home from my grandma's cabin, we had received a call about a meteor shower. This seemed pretty interesting so we parked somewhere along the side of the road where there was a good view of the sky and hung out for a while. We noticed a large cluster of stars (not sure if it was the Milky Way or something) and that the meteors were coming from that general area. After a few minutes of watching the meteors fall, we noticed white dots that looked like stars, but they were moving quickly and were moving along a curving path. I knew it wasn't a meteor because it would of had a little tail and would have burned up very quickly. Another unsettling thing about these dots was that they were moving in curved paths. I remember being told you cant make turns in space without some sort of propulsion device or something of that sort, so I was a little confused at this time. After watching these dots move towards the large star cluster for a while, they suddenly made a sort of bright flash, then moved extremely fast towards the cluster of stars and disappeared in it. Being sort of young and confused, the thought of those things was a little creepy and strange to me then, and it still is now.

This next sighting intrigued and frightened me.

I had just finished my sophomore year in high school and moved in with my grandma. It had been a long day, and I was tired yet restless. Usually the sky is cloudy here at night but on this day it was quite clear. I had finally laid down and had begun to try and fall asleep. I had the windows open because it was a very warm night and I can't sleep in the heat. I was just staring into the sky, letting the soothing sound of the wind woo me to sleep, when I noticed this light. It was red and blue, but it was alternating the colors, so it looked like a cop car. I thinking at first that it may have been a plane of some sort until the flashing lights had suddenly warped to a different part of the sky. They continued to do this for about 5 minutes. One second they were on the right side of the sky, next second they were out of view and then back in again. It was hard to grasp what the hell was going on, and even harder to even try to understand how something can be one place, then in less than a second in another.

I just wanted to share those stories with nosleep as another UFO story had reminded me of my sightings.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g121j/story_of_my_ufo_sightings/
94,"""We're still here...""",1299742184,"It's been about four months since I wrote about the strange occurrences in my apartment.  I wish I could say that things have gotten better, but they haven't.  Things did get better for a while.  I was no longer hearing voices or strange noises and I thought all was well.  Boy was I wrong.  Things picked back up this week.  I was sleeping in the living room after a long day and woke up to the sound of white noise.  There was just a static sound buzzing through the apartment and I had no idea where it was coming from.  I checked all the TVs in the apartment and none of them were on.  None of the alarm clocks were set to go off and the stereo was off as well.  I figured maybe the old lady that lives above us had her volume up too high again and changed it to a blank station.  I sat back down on the couch and turned on the TV and as soon as I did, the buzzing stopped.  Weird, but not unexplainable.

Katie was out at a job interview and I was ecstatic that not only was she actively trying to get a job (easier now that she has a car), but I finally had some time alone in the apartment.  I decided it was time to begin a 5 hour gaming marathon and pulled the comfy chair closer to the LED.  I saddled up for a break neck game of Call of Duty.  I should mention that my friends are extremely competitive and don’t like when you chit-chat during a game.  So there I am, sweatpants, beef jerky, and a sixer of Newcastle enjoying beating the snot out of pre-pubescent nerds with my team of elite (though equally nerdy) friends.  All of the sudden, I notice a shadow dart from the kitchen to the dining table out of the corner of my eye.  I look but I don’t see anything, so I brush it off as the cat stalking a dust-bunny and continue playing.

The action in the game is getting intense and these kids are giving us a run for our money.  I crank up the volume on my Astro A40s and I’m the last of my team alive in a game of search and destroy.  I’m camping the bomb-site, waiting for the enemy to attempt a plant when I hear it.  In the kitchen, there is a loud crash and the sound of glass tinkling on the linoleum floor. “Great,” I think to myself, “I wonder what she broke this time.”  My cat has evil tendencies and if she doesn’t like the way a glass is sitting on the counter, she’ll casually push it to its shattering demise.  I decided to finish out the game before going to check on the mess.  

I kill the last enemy a few seconds later and get up with a sigh.  Losing my balance, I catch myself on the wall and turn quickly to see what the hell I just tripped over.  It was my cat, lying next to the base of my chair, bathing herself.  There was no way in hell that cat could have made it from the kitchen to such a comfortable position in that short amount of time.

Puzzled, I head into the kitchen to see what the hell happened.  When I get there, my heart skips a beat.  Every cabinet door is wide open, every drawer pulled almost all the way out of the racks.  Even the fridge/freezer, oven, and microwave were ajar.  I was too distracted by the scene that I missed the glass on the floor and stepped on a shard, slicing through the bottom of my foot.  I wrapped my bleeding sole in a paper towel, closed the pantry and drawers and cabinets, and swept up the rest of the glass.

When I was done, I stood there for a minute trying to figure out how it came to be.  I was left dumbfounded but I was bleeding and needed to get my foot cleaned up.  I made my way to the bathroom and turned on the tub.  The blood was oozing steadily out and the warm water washing it away felt good.  The cut wasn’t too deep and I was relieved that I didn’t need to drive to the ER.  I was sitting on the edge of the tub, facing out toward the hallway outside the bathroom, wrapping my foot up with some gauze.  I noticed, in my peripheral vision, a sort of shadowy smoky mist forming near where I had been sitting in the living room.  As soon as I looked right at it, it seemed to rush towards me and SLAM!  The bathroom door swung shut with an insane amount of force and scared me enough to throw me backwards into the tub, hitting my head on the soap dish.

I was dazed for a few minutes but came to and got my wits about me.  So now I’m sitting there, in the bathroom, bleeding from the head and the foot, trying to make sense of everything that is going on.  I can hear a faint scratching sound at the door and I tell my cat to “fuck off.”  It doesn’t stop.  She usually listens but she was being persistent.  I pull myself out of the tub and hold some gauze on my head.  “This one is gonna need stitches…fuck.”  I put my ear to the door to listen to the scratching noise.  I can hear a heavy breathing on the other side.  I grab the handle to lock the door.  I can feel the handle start to turn from the other side and feel the door start to bend, as if someone is leaning against it.  

Just when I think the door is going to swing open, the breathing and scratching stop.  I step back, just staring for a moment, and then I remember that I nailed my head pretty good.  I can feel the gauze getting damp with blood, so I take a deep breath, count to three, and open the door….nothing.  No demons or shadows, no grotesque figure, just my empty apartment.  I walked gingerly over to my XBOX and put on my headset.  *“Hey gu-“* my friends cut me off *“Dude what the fuck!?  We heard some god awful screaming and hissing sounds and heard you yelling at someone.  Are you and Katie ok?  Did you get into a fight?”*  I turned white as a sheet.  *“We’re fine…Katie isn’t even here…she’s at an interview.”*  They had since backed out to the pre-game lobby because of what they were hearing.  

They said that after I told them to hold on (to go clean up the glass) they decided to be dicks and start up another match.  They got into another game and from the way it sounds, they heard a high-pitched wail type noise around the same time I cut my foot.  I’ll tell the rest of it as best I can remember:

**Friends** – “Dude, I’m telling you, we heard Katie screaming and crying and heard you yelling.  It was hard to make out what you were saying.”

**Me** – “I dunno, a fuckin glass fell over in the kitchen and I cut my foot, I don’t recall yelling or crying though.”
Friends – “No man…it was plain as day…you didn’t hear anything?  That was the creepiest shit I’ve ever heard!  We had to back out of the game because we couldn’t hear each other over all the noise.”

**Me** – “Nah, I wasn’t even out here, I was in the bathroom cleaning up my foot when the door slammed shut.  I fell into the tub and now I have a gash in my fuckin skull.”

**Friends** – “Man it sounded like someone was getting killed.  We almost thought you were back cause we heard a rustling like you were putting on your mic.”

**Me** – “That was probably the fuckin cat.”

**Friends** – “Shit.  So you didn’t hear anything?”

**Me** – “Nope, I did see some weird shit but I hit my hea-“ – and that’s when I felt it.  The familiar icy touch on the back of my neck, the cold breath on my ear, and heard the whisper “we’re still here...”

95,The Picture,1299741406,"A boy named Tom was sitting in math class, six minutes until the end of school. As he began packing up his work, something caught his eye.

He glanced out an adjacent window and spotted a discarded photograph outside. When school was over, he ran to it and snatched it up.  It was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.  She wore a green dress and tights with red shoes.  She smiled shyly and held a peace sign up to the camera.

Tom immediately knew that he wanted to meet her.  He frantically began showing his classmates the picture to see if they recognized the subject, but was met with a ""no"" each time.  He returned home dejected.  Tom fell asleep that night with the picture on his bedside table.

Tom woke in the early morning to a soft tapping on his window.  As he lay there trying to discover a source for the noise, a quiet giggle came from just outside the window.  He could just make out a faint silhouette outside.  Groggily, he wrestled on a coat, opened the window, and poked his head out.  Whatever it was, it was gone.

Tom carried the picture with him the next day, again getting ""Sorry, No""s from neighbors, teachers, and classmates.  After spending the day feverishly searching for the girl in the picture, he finally put the picture on his bedside table and fell into a deep sleep.

He was awoken once again by a soft tapping.  He quckly snatched up the picture and threw open the window, just in time to make out the figure disappearing into an alley across the street.  He broke into a sprint to chase down the figure.  Headlights and the squealing of tires were his only warning, as his head swiveled left just in time to glimpse the car crashing squarely into his small figure.

-----------------------

The driver jumped out of the car and tried to help him, but it was too late.  Blood was streaked along the road and pooling around Tom's limp and broken frame, look of shock still on his face, photograph still in his hand.  The driver picked up the picture.  It was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.  She wore a green dress and tights with red shoes.  She smiled shyly and held three fingers up to the camera.",nosleep,LevDub,/r/nosleep/comments/g11hi/the_picture/

97,Kajtek.,1299737217,"When I was a kid, we had a tubby orange cat, named Kajtek.

This cat ruled the neighbourhood.  Even the big dogs in the area were scared of him, and would shy away whenever he'd do his rounds.

At home though, he was the sweetest cat ever.  We lived in a ground floor apartment, and he'd often come to my window late at night, scratching at it until I let him in.  Then, he'd hang out on my bed for a bit, before retiring to his own bed in the corner of my room.  I would often fall asleep with the glow of his amber eyes fixed on me; guarding me; making sure that I was safe.

One night, I heard the usual scratching at my window, so I let Kajtek in.  This time, instead of jumping on my bed, he went straight to his own bed.  I thought he may have been hungry, so I went into the kitchen to get him some food.

The light was on, and my parents were both in there, sitting at the table.  My mom was crying.  I asked her what was wrong, and my dad answered for her, ""We found Kajtek at the side of the road this morning, he had been hit by a car.  We took him to the vet, but there was nothing they could do, except ease his suffering.  Your mother and I were in the room with him when he went to sleep, but I think he was looking for you the whole time.""

My face drained of all colour, and I ran towards my room.  I opened the door, and flicked the light on.  The window was closed.  The cat bed was empty.  I turned the light off, and went to shut the door.  Just as I was about to close it, I looked over into the corner.  There was a faint glow of amber eyes, fixed on me.",nosleep,this_time_i_mean_it,/r/nosleep/comments/g10at/kajtek/

0,Homeless,1299733047,"My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. We're both in college, and our relationship started our senior year of high school. She goes to school in Chicago, while I attend a university a bit closer to home,though also in an urban environment. 

Occasionally, I'll head up there and visit her for a long weekend or something just to see her. During my first visit, while walking around near her campus, we encountered a strange man who gave every appearance of being homeless. As per most encounters,he asked for money and we ""regrettably"" denied him. 

We traveled all around Chicago that day, including the downtown area, and I began to notice that same homeless man every few blocks or so. The exact same man. At first, I dismissed it as simple mistake or,at worst, coincidence. He only asked us for money one or two times.

That night, we were waiting for a train at the Metra station to take us back to her dorm for the evening. We were alone on the platform. We were sitting on the bench conversing,when out of the corner of my eye, I noted a figure. As I turned, the figure slid back into shadow. Nervous as I was, I didn't want to alarm my girlfriend so I said nothing and kept my eyes sharp. 

My fears lifted slightly as we finally boarded the train. You know how sometimes, after you settle in from a mindless action (such as getting up and boarding a train), you might sluggishly go over the last several minutes or seconds of your life? Well, I did just that. And as I did, I was startled to realize that I had seen another individual boarding the car next to us. 

We were alone on the platform. How was that possible? Shaken, I leaned into the aisle and shot a glance towards the car behind us. Standing in the center of that car,alone and meeting my gaze,was the man I had seen around the city all day. 

Needless to say, and pardon my language, I flipped the fuck out. My girlfriend usually carries a knife on her when wandering in public, per my suggestion, and I immediately asked if she had it on her. She didn't. When we reached our stop, I watched carefully to see if the man would exit the train with us. As soon as I saw his figure begin to pass through the doors, I grabbed my girlfriend's hand and booked it. After exiting the station, and making it several blocks, I turned and was horrified to see him sprinting after us. Campus was half a mile or so from the station, and we ran the entire way without looking back. Eventually, we discovered he was no longer following us. After alerting campus security, we settled back in at her dorm and forgot the incident entirely.

Monday evening I flew back to my own city. It was well after midnight when I returned, and as I walked through the deserted streets I started to cut through the public park that lies in the center of my campus. Keep in mind, I only did so because my dorm is on the exact opposite side as the parking garage. As I crossed through the park, I encountered a number of homeless people as usual. They rarely ask for money in my city. About halfway through the park I noticed a man sitting on a nearby bench,shrouded in darkness by the lack of working street lights and tree cover. As I passed by, he looked up at me. I prepared to deny yet another man charity when I met the gaze of the same man I had seen in Chicago. His eyes were blazing.

3,"This is something that happened to a friend that the post ""The Witch"" reminded me of.",1299730353,"First of all, this is a true story.  I've got a friend who's a no-nonsense kind of guy - he's always been forthcoming and genuine with me and everyone who's meet him.  Seriously, nicest guy ever and a great friend to have.  This is the kind of guy who's grown up his entire life in the outdoors and hunting on his family's land, spending the night out there by himself, fishing, etc (about 1,000 acres).  

A little bit of background on the land, my buddy's land is out in East Texas near a town where everybody knows everybody, Youkum.  It's a pretty safe part of the country and people are very trusting out there as there's not much to worry about.  The land in question had a cabin deep within the woods, about a mile in, and a normal house towards the entrance to the property.  My friend and his sister were allowed to stay in the cabin by themselves when they were kids because the family knew the land was safe and they had nothing to worry about.

The first year I went hunting with him out there (about four years ago), I asked him what the weirdest thing was that he'd seen out there.  I was sure he'd seen a UFO or something odd in the sky.  He said nothing really, then after pausing for a second, he recalled one time when he was out in the cabin with his sister when he was about seven or so years old.  As they were going to bed, they both heard a terrible sound coming from outside.  He said it sounded like like a cross between somebody wailing in agony and cat's fighting.  'Bloodcurling' was how he described it.  Both he and his sister looked out of the cabin window and he said that about 10 yards away by the treeline, they both saw what he described to me as a 'witch' with pale, white skin standing there, looking straight at the cabin.  

I asked him how he knew it was a witch and he said it looked just like in the books - crooked nose and chin, pointed hat, black, tattered gown.   The one thing that really got to him were her eyes - they were completely black, including the sclera.  He said the witch saw them looking out of the window and raised her hand and pointed at them and made that terrible sound again, cackled, and then vanished into thin air.  He said they freaked out, hung a cross on the front door on the inside, and ran under the covers in their beds and started praying.

Throughout the night they heard scratching and scraping on the cabin walls and banging, along with that terrible sound coming from different directions.  The activity was intermittent  and he said they were finally able to get some shut eye as dawn was breaking.  He said that at one point he ended up wetting the bed because they were so scared.


The next morning when his dad came by to pick them up and they told them what had happened and he was a little ticked that his kid pissed the bed.  He didn't believe them until they saw the deep gouges and scratches on the front door and around the sides of the cabin. The father, according to my friend, went pale and they were never allowed to stay in that cabin by themselves again.  Actually, the family pretty much abandoned that cabin after that and no one went near it for almost two decades.

When we were hunting that evening, I asked my friend to take me to that cabin, just out of curiosity.  At first he was reluctant but after some pleading he agreed to it.  We got there and, boy, was that place eerie as fuck.  The whole cabin was run down and dilapidated from years of disuse.  Sure enough, when you got to the front door, you could see the scratches on the front door, about five feet up, and the cross they had hung on it from the inside.  As we looked around you could see the scratches on the sides of the walls, but they were about eight or so feet off of the ground, so it definitely wasn't an animal.  We'd seen enough that night and we fucking high-tailed it out of there.

We camped out on the land that night and as you can guess, I hardly got a lick of sleep.

4,MOD: The Future of NoSleep...,1299729258,"Eleven months ago, I started NoSleep as a result of [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bhbyx/reddit_what_is_your_creepiest_most_unnerving/) in /r/AskReddit. The stories that were submitted chilled me to the core - I certainly had trouble sleeping that night. 

I created NoSleep with the intention of replicating that thread via a community and was thrilled to see the number of readers rise as quickly as it did. We had some stellar posts (the midnight game attempt and ""She Found Her Way Into My Home"" most recently), were nominated twice in Reddit's BestOf awards and saved almost 13,000 people from sleeping.

As of late, however, the mods and I have noticed a severe decline in submission qualtiy - you've all been pointing it out too. The quality posting we had come to expect from NoSleep has been replaced by ""creepy"" images and videos. 

We (the mods) have actually been talking about this for a few days now and have decided on a course of action.

Effective on March 10, 2011, NoSleep will adopt a new content policy to bring NoSleep back to its former self. The biggest revision is this:

* **Submissions may be self-post only.**

Any new image or video submissions will be removed immediately. We believe that by going back to the .self posts we started out with, we can encourage more people to share their stories (not just paranormal!) anf focus more on real terror, rather than creepy-crawlies. If you want to be creeped out, please check out /r/Creepy. HOWEVER, if you feel that your submission can be supplimented by pictures or a video, place it at the end of your entry. Please keep this to an absolute minimum.

* ** Original fiction and non-fiction submissions are perfectly acceptable. Do NOT specify one way or the other.**
* **Suspending disbelief still stands**

We want our users to submit original content, regardless of its validity. We're here for the scare, not for the plausibility. 

* **Use the Reddit voting system the way it was intended to be used.** 

The voting system is there for you to manage our community.

I realize this will turn away some of our readers, but that's a hit we're willing to take. We (the mods... again) have decided we care more about the quality of the submissions rather than the quantity of readers and posts we have. This subreddit is NOT the place for creepy photos, eerie videos or nostalgia threads. 

If you need some pointers as to what this subreddit is supposed to be, please go read [the thread that started it all](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f07ti/first_and_foremost_fuck_everything_about_what_i/).

10,"I work nights, and I think the building is haunted.",1299706456,"So, I work night at a family shelter. The building used to be a convent but was renovated to hold the families. 
I had a link posted to show a picture of the place but my bosses might not like that so I took it down...sorry guys.

It's owned by the Catholic Church (scary already, I know) and there are still some religious artifacts in the building-a few small statues, and the posts on the bottom of the stairs have crosses carved in. 

My office door, EVERY NIGHT at 3 a.m., closes BY ITSELF. I never see anything, and it closes gently. ""Is it a draft, randomlurker82?"" you may ask. But what are the odds that a draft would appear in the exact same place and time every night? Literally, you could set a watch to it. 

I wonder if the spirits of nuns don't approve of my late night television viewing habits. 

EDIT 1: ok everyone! im here for my shift and I put a door stopper under the door. Will update after 3 a.m. stay tuned.

EDIT 2: thanks for all the upvotes! wasn't expecting so much interest

EDIT 3: I JUST HAD ONE OF THE MOST PANTS SHITTING EXPERIENCES OF MY ADULT LIFE. I had put a rubber stopper under the door, so in the odd event it was a draft, the door wouldn't shut. So, I sat at my desk, and had my phone ready to record. However, I was so freaked out I aimed the phone but forgot to press the record button. Anyways-the door rattled, like a door does when someone is checking to see if it was locked. That was weird...but then came the part that really scared me. In the foyer, there is a little recessed place in the wall where we had a ceramic bust type thing. This thing hasn't moved an inch in the year and change I have worked here. Kids tear through the area regularly, its a high traffic spot in the building. Well, a few seconds after the door didn't close-the thing fell down and broke. It didn't shatter, but it broke...I got a picture of the broken statue and I plan to link the picture here as long as the mods ok it. So, thats it for now.

12,My Gettysburg story,1299701398,"This was couple of years ago, but i recently found this section. Me and my dad went to Gettysburg a couple of years ago( a major civil war battlefield) I was walking out on one of the fields where a battle took place and it was a bit past dusk. It was Cemetary Hill if you are familiar with Gettysburg. No one else was out in the field because they do ranger patrols at night. Well i was just walking around soaking it all in and i decided to sitting on a row of rocks, kind of day dreaming, thinking of what this very field would have looked like on July 2nd 1863. All of a sudden i hear someone sounding like they were running towards me with stuff jingling and clanking around ( Ill never forget that sound). I panicked for a quick second, and looked around and could not hear anything or see anything. As soon as i heard it, it went away. I was very startled and looked all around me, and my Dad was still up by the tree.

15,The witch,1299680387,"This happened to me when I was around 10. Might have been younger, not sure. 

I was sleeping in my bed one night when I heard some noise outside my bedroom window. I peeked out from the edge of the curtain and I saw a horrible looking woman. I was sure it was a witch and I heard her laughing. I didn't really get a good look at her, but it was ugly. I didn't know what to think, so I jumped on my bed and hid under my covers.  I tried my best to hide.

I kept hearing her messing around outside. Right outside my window was a chainlink fence that divided the front yard and the back yard, and also my neighbor's fence. Then I started hearing a grinding noise. Then I saw sparks shooting up. I got under my covers as far as I could. If I could have gotten under my bed I would have. I had a waterbed, couldn't do it. Also my bedroom door was made from metal, and stuck when you shut it. So opening it would have caused a noise and was petrified of her hearing it. Eventually all the noise went away. I didn't go back to the window. I was pretty sure she left, but was afraid she would be standing there waiting for me. Eventually I fell asleep. 

When I woke up, I figured it for a bad dream, and left it at that. I didn't think about it. Or even think of looking at the fence. Over the next couple of months, I did go around by the fence, and never noticed anything about it. Just looked like it always did. Some time later, weeks, months, not sure, I was doing some yard work with my dad. We went by the fence, and he was like that's weird. I said what ?
The gate in the fence always had a chain and lock on it. Now it was laying on the ground in the dirt. Almost couldn't see it because of the grass and dirt around it. When he picked it up, it was pretty obvious it had been cut off. He asked me about it, and I told him I had no idea. But I knew what happened to it. I don't know who, or why.

16,I just had the weirdest dream..,1299677417,"Well I just woke up from the strangest dream I've ever had.


So it started off that I was in this house with a bunch of people. This house was very odd, it had kind of like a blocked off section to it. The people were very adventurous, however, so we decided to walk through it, disregarding any ""no entry"" signs. As we walked through it kind of led to this weird series of underground tunnels and eventually we made it to this weird island. There were bridges leading to this island and it was surrounded by deep water. So everybody starts diving in the water and whatever until we eventually leave.


At this point, most of the people have left so it's down to just like 4 people. When we get back inside the house, we all start feeling weird. Apparently this forbidden area was booby trapped with poisonous stuff. It felt really weird, like I was getting really hot. So I go to take a sip of tap water and I find out that it's the cure for the poison.


Anyway, here's where things get really weird. So I'm in the kitchen and I get this phone call from a person, but it was the wrong number, I think he was calling a sex-line or something lol.  Then after this call some creepy voice comes on telling me to meet this ghost girl inside the cave. I was just like wtffff, but for some reason I went anyway. I think he said they had my cat hostage or something.


So I go inside the cave and at the end of these stairs I see her, and she kept on approaching me and kicking me back. I was scared shitless, so I tried running away. It was weird as fucked. When I get back inside the main house, I was filled with curiosity. I got out my laptop and apparently I had this program that was like street-view in Google Maps but it was for this cave area. So i direct this street view to the stairs. And of course the girl is there. She did the same thing to the streetview camera as she did to me; kicking me back until I was eventually gone.


I woke up after this so this is where the dream ends, but it was just so messed up. I'm scared to go into my basement now lol.

17,Meteor shower and UFO lights,1299675487,"This happened when I was still in grade school, so we're talking early 90s and it was the summertime so I am guessing that it was the Perseid meteor shower.

Back then, it was still a couple years before the internet took off and there was still a sense of community in most neighborhoods. You actually talked to your neighbors. I remember on this night almost everyone on my street was gathered outside to watch the meteor shower which was promised to be very good on the local news that night. Everyone was setup in lawn chairs, adults were having beers and talking, the kids were all playing hide and seek. 

I had a pair of binoculars but wasn't having any luck because of the narrower field of view so I kept missing each meteor that people would point out. The only benefit to the binoculars was it allowed you to see a lot more stars wherever you look (which is coming up later). 

So maybe an hour or so later, some people had left, others were leaving, until someone pointed out something in the sky. There were 7 lights arranged in a triangle just kind of sitting up there, not moving at all. They covered a pretty large area and were brighter than any stars. It didn't take long for someone to say ""UFO"" at which point my little sister got creeped out and wanted to go inside. My mom made me follow, but on the way in I stopped and took a look with the binoculars. I just remember gasping then having my whole body covered in goose bumps. My sister and mom stopped and asked whats wrong. I told them that in between the lights there was only black. You couldn't see any stars behind them. There was a black void inside the triangle blocking all the starlight. I think the way I said it creeped my sister out even more and I was dragged inside.

The local radio station was on and soon after we came inside the DJ was talking about calls he has been getting over the last hour of people seeing the same lights in the sky. I wanted to go back outside but my mom said no.

After my sister went to sleep, I went outside with my mom to talk the dog for a quick walk down the block. The original lights were now gone and she was telling me not to mention them in front of my sister anymore. Then as we were both looking forward we saw something fly in extremely low further down the street, but it was obsured somewhat by some trees. I would estimate it was around 1000 feet away and maybe 100 feet up. The thing stopped dead in its tracks. All I remember is it being a light, I couldn't see any structure, but then suddenly there was a large burst of flames that shot out the bottom of it and extended straight down almost to the ground it looked like and the thing just disappeared. About a second later we heard a noise that sounded like the noise of when a hot air balloon creates some flames, followed by 2 or 3 seconds of deafening silence. It's hard to explain but its like all noise was removed for a brief moment.  The flames almost looked liquid-like because of how they seemed to fall. It didn't seem to behave like normal fire. And unless someone was hot air ballooning in some kind of stealth balloon and crazy enough to do it on a moonless night, I don't think it was a balloon. The dog yelped after the noise happened, and we both got scared shitless and went home.

The following day the local radio and TV mentioned the triangle lights again but that was it. ",nosleep,bendak,/r/nosleep/comments/g0ed8/meteor_shower_and_ufo_lights/
18,Eye Contact with Demons.,1299667067,"This happened roughly 4 years ago, when I was about 16 years old and with my ex-girlfriend. Although this encounter did not happen to me, I was with her at the time it happened.

My ex girlfriend and I were about to leave for a day out downtown. We're getting ready and putting stuff inside of her mini-van that has three rows of seats. As we finish putting everything into the van, we get situated and set to embark on our journey. She gets into the drivers seat and starts to get ready to go.

Seatbelt. Check.

Mirrors...

From the corner of my eye I see her jump. I look over and she is staring into the rearview mirror, completely frightened. I look back to see what's the matter, but I don't see anything but the seats. After about 30 seconds, she breaks stare with the mirror and immediately puts her head into her hands and begins sobbing. 

""What's wrong?"" I asked.

Still sobbing, ""I saw a demon sitting in the back seat, staring back at me.""

As I comforted her, she went on to tell the story of how she has been haunted by demons for over four months now. She said that every time she saw one, she would break away from their stare and when she looked back they were gone. She said that one time she made strong eye contact with a demon for a solid 15 seconds, until it disappeared. The demons remained away for a few weeks.

This was her first contact with a demon since that last encounter.

""I was staring back into it's eyes.""

&gt;They had no substance to their entity, except for small, dimly lit red orbs as eyes, piercing into one's soul. It seems the only way they will disappear for a longer time is if I stare right back into them.

After that encounter, it seemed that she was never approached by another demon...at least to my knowledge.",nosleep,architects1,/r/nosleep/comments/g0ct5/eye_contact_with_demons/
19,Honoring the dead,1299662908,"Hello nosleep,

I've been hesitant to put my story up here, mostly because I'm lazy and not a good writer, but asamorris' thread about nosleep's status quo pushed me to finally tell this story. I figured I should give back to my favorite subreddit.  Also, Reddit's servers have been really touchy tonight and my post may have been double posted by accident earlier.  I've deleted them and reposting this.

I am a Korean guy that immigrated to the States in the late 70's. My dad's sister married a white guy in the U.S. military, and with her help, she sponsored my dad, their two other brothers, and all of their wives and children. It's funny because I used to claim that I am a first generation Korean, but one day I was thinking about it and remembered, ""Hey, I was on the plane too! Oh damn, I'm an immigrant..."" Well, at least I can speak of immigrant issues with some authority! haha. Ok, anyways, we all lived near each other, grew up together, and the families all practiced their old cultural values: my dad and his brothers played traditional Korean board and card games, his sister and our moms would make Korean food. They would also seek out other Korean immigrants and maintain a community of sorts. Pretty much like what any other immigrant families would do. One thing, however, that we did once a year that was a bit unusual was to honor the dead.

Koreans have a cultural ceremony called Jesa. You can read more about it here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesa

Basically, the ceremony is to honor and remember the deceased parent(s) of the oldest son, and all of his siblings, at his house. The event starts in the morning of that special day when the women of the household begin to cook and prepare the food for the event. Towards the evening, they lay out the ceremonial gear (incense, silver ware, etc...), the food, and the pictures of the deceased on a table. The males of the household (including my white uncle, whom I used to tease for having to partake in such non-sense) would stand before the display, and bow several times onto the floor and say something--I forgot what we had to say since it has been almost two decades since I've last done this. So, my dad, his brothers, my uncle, and all of the boys (my cousins and I) would have to do this. My cousins and I would always make a big joke of this whole ordeal. Whenever we prostrated ourselves at the final bow, we would start giggling, ""Hey, I see the food being eaten! It's MOVING! OH NOEESS!!!"" Then my dad would slap one of us on the head. Every year, we would get together to do this ceremony, and every year, my cousins and I would think of the whole thing as a big joke. However, this would not last.

Our tight knit family would grow apart over the years. My white uncle, my dad's sister, and my cousin moved to Japan for the military. My other uncle and my cousin left to San Jose, CA after my aunt died of cancer at a very young age. My dad and his brother had a roiling family feud that would span more than a decade. Ultimately, they stopped talking to each other, and till this day haven't spoken to each other for over 17 years. In that time, our Jesa ceremonies slowly diminished until we put away the ceremonial garb for a couple of years. That is until my white uncle and aunt moved back for good.

I was 4 years old when we first immigrated to the States. By the time my uncle and aunt moved back, I was 18 y.o. and in my final year of high school. I had not seen my cousin and his family for over 8 years. In that time, the feud that grew between my dad and his brother carried over to the entire family. It was a disgusting feud, the details of which would put most soap opera dramas to shame. My cousins fed me all kinds of twisted stories, trying to turn me against not only my returning aunt and uncle, but my own parents. So, when my uncle, aunt, and cousin finally arrived to our home town, I wasn't eager to see them. The anniversary of my grandparents' death was a week away, and my aunt wanted to get together with my dad and our family and hold Jesa--something which we haven't done together in many years. I still had not seen them yet, nor did I want to, and I really didn't want to do any of that bullshit anyways; so, I made an excuse and dug out to my friend's place.

I hung out at my friend's place playing computer games on the good ole Commodore Amiga. I stayed as long as I could, until his mom finally kicked me out at 10 pm. I made the walk back in the dark. I remember noticing the full moon, and how brightly lit and beautifully eerie the walk back home was.

When I finally arrived, my parents were already in bed. My sister, who was 16 y.o., was sleeping as well. No signs of my relatives either. The ceremonial garb was still laid out, and so was some food and the pictures of my grandparents. By the way, my dad's parents died really young. He and his brothers and sisters (one of which never immigrated to the States) grew up extremely poor in war torn South Korea. They were basically living on their own and homeless since they were in their mid-teens until they reached adulthood. Anyways, I looked at the time and it was a bit past 10:30 pm. I got some food, hit the books, and studied for awhile.

Back then, sleep was really important to me. I was always tired in school; so, it was important for me to get 8 hours of sleep every night. I remember looking at the clock and thinking, ""11:50 pm...cool, I have about 7 and a half hours of sleep tonight."" I went to the kitchen, washed some dishes, and turned off the lights to head towards the hallway to my room. I figured it was near midnight when the following occurred.

As I was heading down the hallway in the dark, I heard light patter of rain and drizzle outside. The air felt a bit moist, and the winds began to whistle through the blinds. As I reached the bedroom doors, I heard a faint sound coming from the living room, ""ding, dong..."" Two notes, about a second apart, coming from the piano. My half step slowed to a stop, the hairs on my legs and arms began to bristle, and a sense of dread began to fill my stomach, ""What the..."" I slowly turned thinking, ""Did I just hear the piano???"" As I was thinking this, the piano responded, seemingly to confirm my thoughts, with the same two notes but only louder and one octave lower, ""DING, DONG!"" We've all heard about people joking that they would kick ass and take names when it comes to something that might be supernatural. That they would just mosey on over to where ever the source of this supernatural event occurred and conduct a scientific investigation. I thought I would be one of these people. Boy was I wrong.

I literally froze up. I could not move a damn. My whole body tensed up, and every part of my skin was covered with goosebumps. I was faint from the tension and fear. I almost passed out. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, my ass kicked into gear and I jumped into my room, turned on the lights, ran into my sisters room, turned on her lights, started shaking her to wake up, ""NANCY! NANCY! DID YOU HEAR THE PIANO PLAYING?!? IT WAS PLAYING BY ITSELF!"" She looked at me with wild fear and confusion in her eyes. Then the piano played again: same two notes, one octave lower. It played several times. The blood was draining from my sister's face as she began to understand what was going on. I got her up and we walked to the living room.

When we got there, the piano, an old upright, had the keyboard cover lowered. There was no way anything could directly push down on the keys. There was not enough space for a mouse or rat to get through to the keys. I hesitantly opened the keyboard cover to look. I was anticipating the keys to start playing by themselves again. My eyes glazed over staring at them, waiting for the macabre to appear. Nothing happened, and yet, I was not sure if IT was truly over. At this time, my mom came out of her room, squinting at us through newly awoken eyes, frowning for an answer, ""What you guys doing? So late!"" Then she walked over to the kitchen to get some water and put away some food. As my sister and I helped her, I glanced over at the table for the ceremonial garb. The pictures of my grandparents were...

..

.

not on the table. After some searching, my sister and I eventually found them on the piano with some of our other family portraits. We looked at each other and watched our faces turn pale.

Till this day, my sister and I argue that maybe my memory was foggy and I never saw their pictures on the table. My mother swears she never touched the pictures after she got up that night. My dad doesn't remember a thing about moving the pictures or not, and being the staunch atheist/realist, he just thinks I'm talking out of my ass. But one thing he can't explain, along with the rest of us, is the piano playing.

I hung out at my friend's place playing computer games on the good ole Commodore Amiga.  I stayed as long as I could, until his mom finally kicked me out at 10 pm.  I made the walk back in the dark.  I remember noticing the full moon, and how brightly lit and beautifully eerie the walk back home was.  

When I finally arrived, my parents were already in bed.  My sister, who was 16 y.o., was sleeping as well.  No signs of my relatives either.  The ceremonial garb was still laid out, and so was some food and the pictures of my grandparents.  By the way, my dad's parents died really young.  He and his brothers and sisters (one of which never immigrated to the States) grew up extremely poor in war torn 
South Korea.  They were basically living on their own and homeless since they were in their mid-teens.  Anyways, I looked at the time and it was a bit past 10:30 pm.  I got some food, hit the books, and 
studied for awhile.  

Back then, sleep was really important to me.  I was always tired in school; so, it was important for me to get 8 hours of sleep every night.  I remember looking at the clock and thinking, ""11:50 pm...cool, I have about 7 and a half hours of sleep tonight.""  I went to the kitchen, washed some dishes, and turned off the lights to head towards the hallway to my room.  I figured it was near midnight when the following occurred.

As I was heading down the hallway in the dark, I heard light patter of rain and drizzle outside.  The air felt a bit moist, and the winds began to whistle through the blinds.  As I reached the bedroom doors, I heard a faint sound coming from the living room, ""ding, dong...""  Two notes, about a second apart, coming from the piano.  My half step slowed to a stop, the hairs on my legs and arms began to bristle, and a sense of dread began to fill my stomach, ""What the...""  I slowly turned thinking, ""Did I just hear the piano???""  As I was thinking this, the piano responded, seemingly to confirm my thoughts, with the same two notes but only louder and one octave lower, ""DING, DONG!""  We've all heard about people joking that they would kick ass and take names when it comes to something that might be supernatural.  That they would just mosey on over to where ever the source of this supernatural event occurred and conduct a scientific investigation.  I thought I would be one of these people.  Boy was I wrong.

I literally froze up.  I could not move a damn.  My whole body tensed up, and every part of my skin was covered with goosebumps.  I was faint from the tension and fear.  I almost passed out.  Finally, after 
what seemed like an eternity, I kicked in an jumped into my room, turned on the lights, ran into my sisters room, turned on her lights, started shaking her to wake up, ""NANCY! NANCY!  DID YOU HEAR THE PIANO PLAYING?!?  IT WAS PLAYING BY ITSELF!""  She looked at me with wild fear and confusion in her eyes.  Then the piano played again: same two notes, one octave lower.  It played several times.  The blood was draining from my sister's face as she began to understand what was going on.  I got her up and we walked to the living room.

When we got there, the piano, an old upright, had the keyboard cover lowered.  There was no way anything could directly push down on the keys.  There was not enough space for a mouse or rat to get through to the keys.  I hesitantly opened the keyboard cover to look.  I was anticipating the keys to start playing by themselves again.  My eyes glazed over staring at them, waiting for the macabre to appear.  Nothing happened, and yet, I was not sure if IT was truly over.  At this time, my mom came out of her room, squinting at us through newly awoken eyes, frowning for an answer, ""What you guys doing? So late!""  Then she walked over to the kitchen to get some water and put away some food.  As my sister and I helped her, I glanced over at the table for the ceremonial garb.  The pictures of my grandparents were...

not on the table.  They were on the piano with some of our other family portraits.  Till this day, my sister and I argue that maybe my memory was foggy and I never saw their pictures on the table.  My mother swears she never touched the pictures after she got up that night.  My dad doesn't remember a thing, and being the staunch atheist/realist, he thinks I'm talking out of my ass.  But one thing he can't explain is the piano playing.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/g0bks/honoring_the_dead/
21,Honoring the dead,1299660130,"Hello nosleep,

I've been hesitant to put my story up here, mostly because I'm lazy and not a good writer, but 

asamorris' thread about nosleep's status quo pushed me to finally tell this story.  I figured I should 

give back to my favorite subreddit.  

I am a Korean guy that immigrated to the States in the late 70's.  My dad's sister married a white guy 

in the U.S. military, and with her help, she sponsored my dad, their two other brothers, and all of 

their wives and children.  It's funny because I used to claim that I was a first generation Korean, but 

one day I was thinking about it and remembered, ""Hey, I was on the plane too!  Oh damn, I'm an 

immigrant...""  Well, at least I can speak of immigrant issues with some authority!  haha.   Ok, anyways, 

we all lived near each other, grew up together, and the families all practiced their old cultural 

values: my dad and his brothers played traditional Korean board and card games, his sister and our moms 

would make Korean food.  They would also seek out other Korean immigrants and maintain a community of 

sorts.  Pretty much like any other immigrant families.  One thing, however, that we did once a year that 

was a bit unusual was to honor the dead.

Koreans have a cultural ceremony called Jesa.  You can read more about it here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesa

Basically, the ceremony is to honor and remember the deceased parent(s) of the oldest son, and all of 

his siblings, at his house.  The event starts in the morning when the women of the household begin to 

cook and prepare the food for event.  Towards the evening, they lay out the ceremonial gear (incense, 

silver ware, etc...), the food, and the pictures of the deceased on a table.  The males of the household 

(including my white uncle, whom I used to tease for having to partake in such non-sense) would stand 

before the display, and bow several times onto the floor and say something--I forgot what we had to say 

since it has been almost two decades since I've last done this.  So, my dad, his brothers, my uncle, and 

all of the boys (my cousins and I) would have to do this.  My cousins and I would always make a big joke 

of this whole ordeal.  Whenever we prostrated ourselves at the final bow, we would start giggling, ""Hey, 

I see the food being eaten!  It's MOVING!  OH NOEESS!!!""  Then my dad would slap one of us on the head.  

Every year, we would get together to do this ceremony, and every year, my cousins and I would think of 

the whole thing as a big joke.  However, this would not last.

Our tight knit family would grow apart over the years.  My white uncle, my dad's sister, and my cousin 

moved to Japan for the military.  My other uncle and my cousin left to San Jose, CA after my aunt died 

of cancer at a very young age.  My dad and his brother had a roiling family feud that would span more 

than a decade.  Ultimately, they stopped talking to each other, and till this day, haven't spoken to 

each other for over 12 years.  In that time, our celebration of Jesa slowly diminished and at one point, 

we put away the ceremonial garb for a couple of years.  That is until my white uncle and my aunt moved 

back for good.  

I was 4 years old when we first immigrated to the States.  By the time my uncle and aunt moved back, I 

was 18 y.o. and in my final year of high school.  I had not seen my cousin and his family for over 8 

years.  In that time, the feud that grew between my dad and his brother carried over to the entire 

family.  It was a disgusting feud, the details of which would put most soap opera dramas to shame.  My 

cousins fed me all kinds of twisted stories, trying to turn me against not only my returning aunt and 

uncle, but my own parents.  So, when my uncle, aunt, and cousin finally arrived to our home town, I 

wasn't eager to see them.

The anniversary of my grandparents' death was a week away, and my aunt wanted to get together with my 

dad and his family and hold Jesa--something which we haven't done together in many years.  I still had 

not seen them yet, nor did I want to, and I really didn't want to do any of that bullshit anyways; so, I 

made an excuse and dug out to my friend's place.

25,Babysitter. ,1299650199,"""The Baby Monitor"" post reminded me of this memory. 

I was around 10 or 11, at my typical after-school babysitter. There was a little girl who I'll call ""sally"" who was asleep for naptime when I arrived back from school. Me and the babysitter just chilled out and watched cartoons while all the ""younger"" kids slept, and Sally had a baby monitor to make sure she stayed asleep. After awhile of Scooby-Doo we heard Sally begin to laugh. The weird thing about her laugh was that it sounded specifically like when she was being tickled. Me and my babysitter just kind of sat there for a few minutes and listened, as we were very confused. Then after a few minutes of hysterical laughing, we heard Sally say ""bye bye pa-paw."" Then she fell back asleep. 

We sat there like....wtf was that and then returned attention to the tv.

A little while later, the babysitter got a phone call from Sally's mother informing her that her Grandfather had passed away from a heart attack. 

Not really a scary story in my opinion, but very very eerie. And now that Sally is much older, I'll have to ask her if she remembers anything about that next time I see her. ",nosleep,ankhr,/r/nosleep/comments/g0a1a/babysitter/

29,My creepy story of my new phone.,1299646057,"One time I got stoned with a couple of friends of mine. I had just gotten a new phone and we were in his living room talking and cracking jokes. My friend was messing with my phone and took a 15 second clip. The next week I was looking thru my phone and found the little movie. This is what I saw...

It was just a quick pane of us. His brother and I were talking and he was holding the camera phone.

It panes around to the light next to my buddy and I start talking, you hear my friend laugh and as it gets centered on me. Then a deep voice says something kind of close to the microphone and I assume it was my friend. 

So I play it again and try to make out what the voice said, still thinking it's my friend.

""You _____ us."" In a deep breathy voice. It almost sounded like when you shuffle around some paper near a microphone. Only, with structure, but with the same brevity. Definitely crapped my pants a little, but I rationalized and assumed it was my friend talking into the mic. But still uneasy. 

I decided to get some answers. I huddled up my friends from that night and played the video. Again and again and again. We were all quiet and trying to understand wtf was going on in the video. 

We dumped it into my buddies computer and blasted the speakers, with the video and the noise we could distinguish what happened. 


00:01, it starts with my buddies brother talking. 

00:05, the bird cage, and my other friend listening to the story. and now I'm talking.

00:07, the center of the living room is being filmed. My friend who is filming says something. It's clearly him, his voice and it kind of sounds like he's on the right side, close... but still.

00:09, the camera starts panning towards me

00:12, the voice and me in the middle.  [""oh fuck no!!!"" we shout after we realize what it might have said]

00:15, back to the center of the living room. Video ends.


There were basically 3 freegin words that it could have been. I personally think it said. ""You protect us""

My friends say that it said, ""You betray us""..

But we all know what it really said. )-: And everyone that had seen the video says the same thing.

31,Sometimes my dreams make me never want to sleep again...,1299645506,"I had this dream the other night - it was the first time I have actually felt physical pain in a dream...

It was a two part dream. Initially I dreamed I was lying down in bed and looking out the glass door. Two rabbits sat outside the door and watched me. They began to tunnel under the door, and I knew they were coming to bite me. I wasn't scared, and they tunneled under and ran up onto the bed with me, then just sat and watched me for a minute. Everything was very quiet, and then they started to chew on my kneecaps. I didn't mind.

I woke up, but when I fell asleep, I was right back to dreaming.

I dreamed that I was sitting around the house I grew up in with some older version of my friends that I haven't seen in years. We were having lasagna. My mouth started to feel weird... I went and looked at myself in the mirror.

I had rabbits teeth.

My teeth started clenching tighter and tighter, it hurt, really hurt, and then they started cracking and splitting and shattering until I had no teeth left and I was mashing my nerves together.

33,The Baby Monitor ,1299643103,"This is a story about a friend of mine, Katie.

Katie went to babysit this family she knew that lived up the road. She was pretty excited since she was newly 14, and this was her first babysitting job. Determined to do a good job, Katie followed all the rules. She had her dad drop her off a little early, paid really close attention to the emergency contact numbers, what all and that. 

At first the night's just like it should be. The baby, named Lily, went into her crib without fuss and fell asleep easily enough. At two years old she was a bit old for a crib, but her parents just hadn't bothered with the transition to a ""real"" bed. Katie made sure the baby monitor was positioned properly. She took the receiver downstairs and turned on the TV. From eight o'clock to ten o'clock she watched a movie, some silly film not worth remembering, and prided herself on what a good job she was doing. At every commercial break, at least for the first hour, she went upstairs to check on the baby. During the last hour... eh, the monitor was silent, Lily seemed fast asleep, so Katie just enjoyed the show. 

Just after the movie ended, Katie first heard the voice. 

""Hey baby. Hey baby. Come here, baby,"" the voice whispered. The voice came from the baby monitor. 

""Come here, baby, come here!""

Maybe she'd heard it wrong. Maybe it was the TV. Her heart race, her throat went dry. She must have heard wrong. With the receiver clutched tight in one hand, Katie flew upstairs to check on Lily. 

She found Lily standing up in the crib, her chubby hands gripping the sides and face pointed toward the window. 

The completely open window. 

The window that Katie knew, beyond a doubt, had been closed the last time she'd checked on the baby. ",nosleep,ToasterforHire,/r/nosleep/comments/g08f0/the_baby_monitor/

39,Sharing,1299637658,"I’m not sure whether this story belongs in the nosleep category, as it’s only really unnerving for me.  It’s weird to type out these thoughts and feelings, even anonymously, but there are events in my life that I can’t fully explain, and I feel like you need the back story to understand.  

I have an older brother (by just 17 months--I think I may have been a little accident).  He’s severely handicapped.  He was born with a condition that causes him to have mini-seizures every few seconds, so he’s never been able learn or focus, and he’s pretty much catatonic.  Throughout his life it has progressively gotten worse, and the doctors didn’t think he’d live past 1 yr, then past 2 yrs, then past 5, adolescence, etc., but he has.  He has a feeding tube, can’t recognize anything around him (well, maybe people, vaguely), never has been able to talk or even barely move, and needs a caretaker basically 24/7.   

Of course, I was raised with him so he wasn’t so strange to me, I guess…although he certainly scared other kids.  I did begin developing fears that I would end up like him.  When would it happen to me?  When would my brain and body start to fail me?  I started having these hypochondriac-ish thoughts when I was about 10-11, but my parents assured me I was perfectly healthy.  It’s not that I didn’t love my brother, but he was worse than a dumb pet (sorry, but I’m going to be honest with my thoughts at that age)...a pet that could only barely react to your presence with a faint gurgle and face twitch…and even then, maybe only one fifth of the time.  It was frustrating.  And I know he is their child and part of our family and parents love their children unconditionally, but especially when I was younger, he was a massive burden--emotionally, financially, time-consuming, just everything.  I realize how disrespectful this sounds, believe me.  I remember seeing What’s Eating Gilbert Grape and wishing he was like Arnie, then at least he’d be able to talk…at least he’d be a real person.   

Like other mentally and physically disabled children, he went to high school (and had his caretaker, we’ll call her Martha, with him at all times).  She just pushed his wheelchair around all day because there was nothing he could learn or do in a class.  He and I actually went to the same high school but it was big and I didn’t see him much, as the special ed. area was in a separate building.  

Sometime during Spring, when I was about 16, I was walking down the hall at school and had a quick daydream of being outside.  It was just a daydream, but it freaked me out for a second and brought back all those fears from when I was younger about developing his condition of having constant mini seizures.  But weirdly, I had these quick-flash daydreams maybe 30-40 more times after that throughout the rest of high school.  Sometimes it would be a flash of the hallways while I was sitting in class, or the crowded cafeteria when I was outside.  I just ignored them.  They only lasted a second, but still didn’t seem like seizures until one day while in gym.  I was in the locker tying my shoes when I had a flash of being outside and looking up at the trees, then all of a sudden I saw Martha’s face peer over me, smiling and talking in a jumbled-up way, then it was over.  It completely freaked me out.  I thought for sure I was having a seizure and a brief hallucination of being my brother.  It bothered me so much I asked my parents if I could go in for a check-up, but they thought it was just my hypochondria rearing its ugly head again.  They told me it was just psychological and that my brother was on everyone’s mind lately because his health was fading…(not having any cardio exercise for 18 yrs was taking its toll on his heart and respiration).  I think it’s because they didn’t want to pay for any brain scans that would likely turn up nothing, but I can’t blame them, I had been a little pussy hypochondriac when I was younger and they had learned to deal with it.

41,My First and Only Bloody Nose,1299633103,"I've wanted to share an experience I had when I was 15 at my grandmothers house and I think this sub-reddit is the perfect place to share with you guys.  

First off my family is incredibly religious while I on the other hand am not.  I'm not saying that I don't believe in God or anything my family is just really hard core about going to church every single day and that's no joke even on holidays.  The reason for the serious devotion is because they claim that they've been either attacked or visited by dark entities that they know are evil.  My grandmother, mom, and aunt have all shared with me their stories, but I never really believed them.  I figured they were just trying to scare me to going to church with them.


Well around Thanksgiving my mom, sister, and some aunts came to visit my grandmother who lives in Fresno, California.  I hated going to visit her not necessarily because I didn't have fun, but because her house was always ALWAYS freezing cold during the winter months.  Since the house only had 3 rooms and usually lots of people came over I had to sleep in the cold living room with my cousin.

So after hanging out with the family everyone starts going to sleep and its just me and my cousin setting up all these blankets on the floor to sleep on.  I didn't like sleeping on the couch because they were uncomfortable to sleep on and my whole body couldn't fit on it.  Plus that would leave one of us on the floor alone which was stupid so we both decided to sleep together.  

Now I have to sort of explain how my grandmothers living room is set up in order for the rest of the story to make sense and I took the time to make a rough diagram.  

http://imgur.com/oRGAw

Now as you can see in my crude diagram the moonlight would shine light into the entire living room.  Behind the couch was just some open space and a door that led to the garage and another door that led to backyard.  Me and my cousin are both trying to get to sleep but for some reason were just staying up and talking about life and highschool stuff that was going on at the time.  

Suddenly I get really cold out of nowhere and start shivering.  I asked my cousin if she left the door open to the backyard as it sometimes gets left open on accident.  I peak over the couch to check on the door and I can see that the handle for the sliding glass door all the way to the right and that blinds for the door were closed so the door had to be closed.  However I noticed something quickly.  I couldn't see anything to the left of the door.

The top left corner of the living room was completely shrouded in this completely dark shadow.  I could only see the right half of the sliding glass door and left side was slowly being engulfed by an enormous shadow from floor to ceiling.  

Now as you remember in my diagram the whole right wall of the living room was made of glass so the moonlight was shining all the way to the wall on the left side of the room.  It was surreal the whole living room was bathed in this moonlight except for that one dark corner that refused to be illuminated.  The shadow then started growing larger and as soon as it overcame an object in that corner I couldn't see it all.  I literally saw planters and toys just disappearing to the shadow.

Now this is all happening in a few seconds and at first I think its my eyes playing tricks on me.  So I shake my cousin and tell her to look at the far left corner of the room and sure enough she sees the shadow too.  So I know I'm not crazy and out of nowhere I'm just terrified and shivering and can't move because I'm so scared and then the shadow covers the hole back wall and I can't see the sliding door glass at all.  

The shadow then just rushes at us and I can't move and neither can my cousin.  I can't even make a sound.  Everything in the room just gets enveloped in this swirling blackness and the moonlight is literally being eaten away and then it rushes over us.  

I was in complete darkness for like a second. I couldn't see anything not even the couch literally inches in front of me, but I could still feel the blankets around me and my cousins presence, and this terrible sense of dread.  And just like that it was all over and entire living room was awash in moonlight.  Everything was so well lit and defined it didn't make any sense.  

My cousin then hugs me and starts crying and I was freaked out I didn't know what to do and then it happens. She starts getting a bloody nose and then I get a bloody nose immediately after the shadow left.  My cousin used to get them all the time when we were kids for random reasons, but I had never had a bloody nose in my entire life.  Here I was just scared out of my mind holding my cousin and were both just bleeding all over each other and I couldn't think of anything else, but just turning on the lights.  

We turned on the lights, went to the bathroom, washed up and then banged on my grandma's door begging her to let us sleep on her floor.  I barely got any sleep that night. 

The weird thing is that I found no evidence of the blood the next day.  My clothes were clean the blankets were clean everything.  It didn't make any sense.  My cousin didn't have any bloodstains either. I've never had a bloody nose since that event.  ",nosleep,smoogums,/r/nosleep/comments/g055t/my_first_and_only_bloody_nose/
42,Working at Pilgrim State Psychiatric Hospital during the 60's,1299631230,"My Dad was born and raised on Long Island, and as a teen worked in the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Hospital where his parents also worked. My Dad has told me many stories about the hospital, and the procedures they did on patients, but there was one that always stayed with me.

Due to a incident involving a baby grand piano, a ramp, and a wall my dad was assigned to show movies to the craziest or the crazies. The ones that took 5 or 6 strong men to take down. My dad would do this basically alone while the attendants went on smoke break. At the time my father was a bean pole, tall and lanky so this was a pretty scary job for him. He would take each patient out, one at a time from their rooms and sit them down in front of the movie screen, then quickly go get the next man(they would only seat a few men at a time). One time, about half way through the movie my Dad started hearing this thudding noise from down the hallway. Every room had 2 doors, as a security measure. You would open one door go into a little room, lock the door behind you, then open the patients door. These doors also weren't made from cheap or flimsy material, they were solid wood doors. This one patient was running head first into the door so hard that the door was bowing out from the frame. He was going absolutely bat shit crazy. As calmly as one could be in this situation, my dad went and got an attendant then went to put the rest of the patients back in their rooms in case they act out also. As soon as the man who was flipping out had been restrained, a doctor gave him a shot of god-knows-what. After the shot, 2 attendants stood on either side of the patient and grasped his arm then began walking around in a big circle leading the man. They walked around for what seemed like hours, until they were dragging this man who had now fallen asleep. Having watched this, my dad leaned over to the Doctor and asked ""hey, dont you think you couldve given him something *stronger* ? you know, so it wouldn't have taken so long?"" The Doctor looked at my dad and replied ""If I had given that shot to you, you would have been dead hours ago.""

All his stories of the hospital are a real insight into a whole different time. Heres more on the [hospital](http://www.opacity.us/site23_pilgrim_state_hospital.htm)",nosleep,punksqerll,/r/nosleep/comments/g04l2/working_at_pilgrim_state_psychiatric_hospital/

46,Dear /nosleep...,1299627881,"Once, I bitched at you. Not because you were mean. Not because you were ill-informed, or weak, or wrong. No, because you scared the hell right out of me. You were perfect. You lived up to your name, quite literally in my case. I spent two weeks getting an hour or two of sleep a night, because I was addicted to the /nosleep sub. I nominated it for ""Best New Sub-Reddit"", specifically because it was exactly what it claimed to be, and damned good at it. 
  However, something has changed. Maybe it was the influx of new members after the awards, I don't know. But the community feels like an impostor of itself now. A cheap one, to boot.                                                         Once there were ""true"" ghost stories, terrifying pics and videos, and the occasional ""creepy"" could it be real story. Now, it seems like every other post (or more) is an obvious piece of lackluster fiction. I joined /nosleep because it bested r/creepy. because of this clause: ""Everything you read in r/nosleep is true"". What a fantastic bit. However, it is hard to ""suspend disbelief"" when almost the entire front page, day after day, is inundated with obvious short stories with twist (or no) endings. 
 I appreciate people expressing themselves, and I enjoy a good scary story, but I feel like there are subs more suited to those who post that sort of thing. 
 Perhaps I am in the minority, because obviously, if these things are getting on the front page, it probably reflects what the community enjoys, but to me, it isn't /nosleep.
  What makes /nosleep /nosleep, is the actual fear you get *not knowing* whether it is true or not.

I apologize if I offended anyone, or if I am out of line in any way. I just felt the need to send my plea for a better /nosleep out into the dark.

49,Crazy roommate loses his mind.,1299612787,"I was inspired by another story on /r/nosleep about a crazy roommate losing his shit during college and decided to share one. This story didn't happen to me, it happened to a friend, but it is hilarious no less.

MY friend Cameron moved from Indiana to Savannah, GA about a year ago and stayed with his friend Lee. At the time, Lee was just an introverted college nerd trying to juggle multiple courses and a job.

Within the first two or three months that Cameron was there searching for a job and trying to keep on his feet, Lee had his shit together, but around the fourth month of living there, things began to change.

At first, Lee would come home at night and sit in a chair in front of the couch that Cameron slept on and stare at Cameron. It was visibly an odd behavior at first, but Cameron pretended that it was nothing.

Another two or three weeks went by and finally Lee began sitting in the chair in front of the couch Cameron slept on while listening to raging, heavy house music. He'd blare it so loud that Cameron was unable to sleep.

About three more weeks go by as Cameron tries to let Lee know that he doesn't enjoy the blaring house music, but Lee slips deeper into the abysmal pit of lunacy. A once avid atheist, he has now become a born again Christian and not only listens to blaring house music, but begans spouting off obscure bible versus to Cameron as he attempts to sleep, Lee himself *never* sleeps.

Things get worse and soon, Lee is walking around the college campus he went to spouting incessant bullshit, most of it religious, yet illegible in nature. His friends then become worried and decide to stand their distance, yet offer all the help they can. Cameron surrenders to Lee's ways and moves out onto the streets, as he hasn't yet found a job. As well, he believes that his intrusion into Lee's life may have tipped the scales and that this was all just an attempt to make him leave. This however is *very* wrong.

A week or so later, Cameron get's a call from a troubled Lee, who is panting very loudly and sounds as if he is running. An odd story then unfurls.

Lee had snapped, the religion and annoying house music unable to hold him together, and for seemingly no reason, he began running. He started from where he lived and began running down the sidewalk somewhere in Savannah, he then began running through yards, then over fences, through apartment complexes, out back doors, through front doors, through someones window. Pretty much, if it was some sort of portal that could be run through, he ran through it shoving whoever was in his way, out of his way. 

Finally, the cops began to pursue him and he began leaping over fences parkour style with this newfound, immense energy. He had leaped over an untold amount of fences when he finally turned around to see if he'd lost the cops. The moment he turned back around to look in front of him again, he was fractions of an inch from a wooden fence and slammed straight through it.

Luckily, he had lost the cops untold moments prior and was able to catch his breath for a moment. Now depleted of energy, he leaped over his last fence, walked to the largest park in Savannah (Savannah Central Park?), and fell asleep under a tree.

The next morning he woke up, smelling like rancid body odor and began walking around the park, confused. Finally, he walked over to the playground, began shoving kids over, leaping into the large water fountain nearby and then hopped onto the swings, where he began shouting expletives at all the horrified children.

The parents actually thought he was an escaped mental patient and called the police. In almost no time at all, a Medstar van pulled up and two large men jumped out, subdued the insane Lee and drove him off to a state funded suicide watch, where he was strapped to a table in a locked room and interrogated for several hours before his parents were contacted and eventually flew down from New Jersey several days later.

He was immediately given the help he needed and from what I understand, went back to college and is doing alright. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fzxuh/crazy_roommate_loses_his_mind/
50,The door with the window.,1299608342,"I don't know what happened. I was sitting at my computer, listening to music. I was alone, the doors locked, the sun set. Earbuds in, and I was trying to ignore the huge window set in the door, not two feet away from me. 

Whatever it was, it was there for a long time. The motion sensing lights above the door pick up anything that moves as fast as a human.


But I'm pretty sure it wasn't. I was humming along to my music, grinning and smiling and not noticing the thing standing at the window. But I did see the doorknob turn slowly, and catch what faint light there was. All of a sudden I couldn't move, and slid my eyes to the side, watching the door click open. All I could hear was my music.


It slid one foot inside, insanely slowly. The head came next- A bulbous thing, vaguely human, brushing the ceiling. It's mouth dropped open, showing broken teeth and bone. It started moving its lips, coinciding with the song I was listening to- But whatever it was saying, all I could hear was ""I have weird memories of you, I have weird memories, memories, memories"" 

 The song was skipping. I blinked. In that second, the song returned to normal, and it was gone. All that was left was a door, swinging wide open in the sudden wind, and the light outside flickering on. 

After an hour of staring at the black outside, with only the pool of light and the wildly swinging door (where had the wind been earlier?) to focus on, I closed and locked it all up, and went to bed. The light went out.

  I forgot about it. That computer goes unused now, and that door is always locked.

 But last night, I was lying in bed, and I heard the door open. I don't want to know, I don't want to know what it says. Please, just let me have my music.",nosleep,trillian_andtheghost,/r/nosleep/comments/fzw97/the_door_with_the_window/
51,Shadow People,1299607815,"A while ago, when my son was a LITTLE KID, my wife and I bought him a kickass teepee. When I say teepee, I mean a full size (albiet flimsy) teepee that was almost tall enough not to fit in the house.

At the time we had a humongous master bedroom with very little furniture. We decided to set up the teepee around 6 or so feet to the side of our bed. My son slept in that teepee for a solid 6 months, if not more. Near the end the thing was held together by duct tape and replacement sticks because I had to patch up every break and tear the boy did to it. It was pretty damned awesome, if you ask me.

I remember the day that it changed. I did not experience this on my own, since i have been told that I am as spiritual as a rock. Also, without my glassess, I can't see past my nose. My vision is even worse in the dark.

All I know was that one morning, my wife and my son were very quiet and seemed as though they were very disturbed. I gave my wife a ""what's going on?"" look, and she gave me back a ""I will tell you later"" face. If you know anybody long enough, you know what I am talking about with these facial expressions.

After my son went to school (First grade? Second?) I asked what was going on.

My wife said that, while she was lying in bed, she saw a dark shadow come from either the bathroom or the large walk-in closet (which are right next to each other). It didn't look like a ""shadow"" in the sense that you could follow the shadow to what is blocking the light, she said it looked like the ""absence of light"". I got a little chill but somehow calmed myself down by convincing myself that my wife was seeing things.

She said that the shadow slowly floated across the room toward her and eventually began to float between our bed and the teepee. My wife said that she was a little scared but had enough sense to realize that she was hallucinating, so she squeezed her eyes shut and covered her head with the blanket. She doesn't remember how long she stayed under the sheets until she decided to poke her head out. When she finally did, she said it was gone.

Well i was SUFFICIENTLY freaked out; even though i was a non-spiritual person, i too heard things--weird things! in that house. the pounding of stomping feet or roughhousing upstairs on the wood floors when I knew there was nobody there, a deep masculine voice upstairs when the only two men in the house were a child and I. Doorknobs rattling. Quite easily dismissed in my mind, though. Just hearing things. So I told my wife that maybe she was seeing things.

Then she told me that after she peeked out from under the blanket, she had let out a little relieved sigh. Then my son, hearing her awake, began to talk.

""Mom? You Awake?""

""Yes, son. What's wrong?""

""Did you see that shadow too?""

After that night, my son, didn't want to sleep in our room anymore. Hell, neither did I.",nosleep,JoeyBannana,/r/nosleep/comments/fzw1m/shadow_people/

54,Recurring Nightmare Since Childhood,1299599396,"This is a strange story to write, because it's one of those super-scary things that don't actually seem all that scary when you take them out in the light of day.  Like clown dolls for anyone that has seen the movie POLTERGEIST ( I am 36 years old, and I CANNOT sleep in a room that has a clown in it because of that movie, and to THIS DAY, looking under the bed when the lights are off is OUT OF THE QUESTION, like trying to fish a fork out of a garbage disposal.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch this, it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen in my life).  

Anyway, I've always had this dream that I'm walking around my house after everyone is asleep, whether it's to use the bathroom, or to get a drink of water.  It doesn't matter if I was living with my parents, with roommates, or now living with my family, it's always the same dream, just the settings change.

I get to the living room, and there I see someone sitting in the dark area wearing a tophat and a tuxedo.  They are rustling the way someone that sits would rustle, crossing and uncrossing their legs.  When I get around to see who it could be, the head turns, slowly, that creepy slow that every film maker has perfected in that ONE SHOT that you catch in good horror flicks, and when they face me, it turns out that it's a skeleton.  Nothing campy, no monacle, no jabbering mandible that lets out a cackle, just a skeleton...and every time I see it, I try to scream, and every time I try to scream, I'm stuck in that nightmarish NO-VOICE-CAN'T-SCREAM grip of terror, and the skeleton looks away, and I wake up, usually screaming.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago...my brother has been staying with me for the past few weeks on and off, he has a key and I told him to let himself in and out as he pleases, just to give me a heads up when he's coming (txt, VM, whatever).  It was one of the nights that he was staying over, and he usually stays in the basement.  I came downstairs for a drink, and it was just like the old nightmare.  In the living room was a figure sitting on the couch, fidgeting slightly, and I approached slowly, thinking I'm in the nightmare.  Just like in the nightmare, the figure turned slowly, and instead of the skeleton, I just saw a shadowy face, and when I screamed, this time it was loud and big, and the figure jumped!  Yes, it WAS my brother, who now thinks I'm a scared little girl for screaming in the middle of the night.  It was really scary to actually be able to scream!

Honestly after this experience I think that the scariest part of the dream is that I am unable to scream every time.

57,The Scribe,1299583030,"Every person has their own separate reality, a perceptive reality that is anchored to other people’s via the universal unconscious. This provokes a sense of order in physics and the way the world is. In this way, humans are unique. They’ve developed this sense of cognizant strength and seemingly reality altering ability by linking their unconscious minds to other human beings. 
       


But outside of this connected existence is the threat of infinite danger. Just outside of our mind’s eye is a perverse chaos filled with numberless beings most of which are completely unimaginable and terribly violent. A window of them may be slightly visible in the form of what you’d perceive as stories, urban legends, hauntings, abductions or rantings of madmen. But they have always been easily explained away with enough logic. Nonetheless they are slowly crawling their way in, one person’s life at a time.
     


The only protection we have is the militant disbelief of anything outside of this existence or the blissful unawareness of it all. In a way this lack of knowledge, this inability to perceive the outside worlds builds a shell that protects us from outside forces.
     


The more you know about all these horrors, the more you believe, the more the idea creeps into your reality. Eventually you’ll pull so far away from the universal unconscious that your world will seem to make no sense. You’ll become susceptible to this invasion, and just like an immune system, the universal unconscious will wall you off and attempt to keep you from infecting anyone else. It does this by causing others to perceive you as schizophrenic or insane, it’ll mask anything you say with an illusion to give them at least a shadow of doubt. 


If you didn’t think somewhere in the back of your mind that what I’m saying is fiction, you wouldn’t even be able to see these words. If I gave you sudden undeniable proof the wall of ignorance would shield it from you, and you’d see it as something else entirely. The only reason I can get this to you is because of how hard it is to believe. The only true way for something to creep into your reality is to slowly chip away your defenses by causing you to come to your own conclusions and beliefs outside of the norm.


The more you read things like this and think about it and see the world for what it is, the more the shell of disbelief will crack. And the more susceptible you’ll be. First the world will seem like a dream. Like your mind and world is clouded in a fog that is not there. You’ll feel yourself mentally and emotionally pulling away from everyone else. The mundane will become harder to understand. Quick glances of something impossible moving just outside of your view will slowly turn into your world slipping into a vast nightmare until you’re cut off from the realities of others entirely. Eventually, to be trapped alone and unprotected as the plaything of whatever beings have invaded your perceptions.


I write this now because I have to. I have slipped away and something has consumed me. My world is filled with a darkness that’s hard to explain and though I maintain a sense of stability and normalcy, I struggle to hold onto my sense of reality. By anchoring myself in any way I can to yours I hope to not slip any further away.


I must however, appease the things slowly crawling into my view. Their words chatter in my mind incessantly and the pain I endure by disobeying them is becoming unbearable.They want you as well, and they insist that others have fallen and everyone else shall follow with enough time. For each person that slips away, the psychic web of realities pulls further apart and weakens.  They want control. They want physical form, and they are immortal. 


From here on I will write what they want me to because I cannot disobey them any longer. These ‘stories’ I will be describing are things they’ve commanded me to tell. Truths that have happened, are happening or will be happening soon. Their primal language is hard to understand, it doesn’t translate exactly into English, or any human language it seems. But I'll try my best. The more you read, the more everything will creep into your mind. The more you’ll question your perception. Stop here and you might be safe.

58,There's nothing outside this room.,1299578767,"I'm in my bedroom right now. Or at least, I think I'm in my bedroom. It looks like my bedroom. The problem is that I opened the door, to go and get a drink of water, and there's nothing outside. There's literally nothing on the other side of the doorway.

When I opened the door, I had my ceiling light, my desk lamp, and my computer monitor on. The light wan't shining on anything on the other side. It was pitch black... no, black is a color. This was like what you see when you close your eyes. It wasn't black, it was complete absence of vision. I couldn't even see the floor directly in front of me - I could see the carpet in my bedroom, I could see the wooden board that marks the threshold, and then there was just... a void. Looking at it made me want to vomit. I would toss a penny out there to see what would happen, but I already know I'm not going to hear it hit anything, and that's going to make me even more sick, so I'm not going to.

The only other way out is my window. I live in a city, so there's always a faint light from the street lights that you can see through the curtains. Not tonight. I fucking know there's nothing on the other side of my window, too, and there's no fucking way I'm going to open the curtains.

I have my cellphone, but something is telling me not to call 911. Something is telling me that if I lie, and say there's been some sort of accident in my apartment... I just know that I can't do that. I know that if there *is* anything out there, on the other side, I can't let it in.

I don't think I'm actually in my bedroom. It looks exactly like my bedroom, but it feels wrong. Something about it is off. It's a perfect copy of my bedroom. I need to leave.

65,Caspar the friendly ghost,1299555204,"I had always been somewhat sensitive to the supernatural, more so than the others I encountered at least.  That's why my most recent encounter with the supernatural didn't really surprise me all that much.

You should know I live in a house with multiple bathrooms throughout the house.  I live alone and it is really more than I can handle but it is a large victorian style house which I love.

One morning I woke up and as I always did took a shower.  The pressure of the shower seemed a little weak which usually happened if I forgot to shut off a faucet all the way so I chalked it up to that.  Eventually I found the faucet and shut it off.  The next day I made sure all the faucets were off before my morning shower and the water pressure was normal when I got into the shower, but got weaker mid way through.  I got out of the shower and noticed the faucet in my bathroom was on as well as a tic tac toe board drawn in the fog on my mirror.  

This did not bother me at all and if anything intrigued me a bit.  I assumed perhaps the ghost of a child was roaming around my house and I dubbed him Caspar, after the movie.  Amusingly I decided not to wipe off the board and instead placed an X in the middle.  

The next day when I got out of the shower I noticed an O had been placed on the board.  Me and Caspar continued this game until one day I finally won.  

Caspar didn't like losing.  

Instead of games random marks on the mirror would appear and sometimes I just got the vibe that Caspar was, in lieu of a better word, pissed.  Eventually though I thought Caspar would get over it and be happy once again.  That is why I was happy when the playful, ""clean me,"" appeared on the mirror, something you would write on the window of a dirty car.  I thought this was funny so I went and wiped the mirror as Caspar had suggested to appease him. 

When I wiped the mirror, the face I saw staring back at me wasn't a child, and it wasn't friendly.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fzhx0/caspar_the_friendly_ghost/
66,Woman In White,1299550455,"I'm a college student, and this took place over my most recent winter break. I was giving my friend Jordan a ride home after a night of hanging out, I would say it was about 3 AM. On the way to his house there is a valley that you drive through, with a creek in the middle at the lowest point. There are no houses in the valley, just a trail that people run on.

As we drove through the valley I was focusing on the road when Jordan turned to me and said ""Did you see that?""

""See what?"" I asked

""There was a woman in white, trying to wave us down, didn't you see her?"" I tried searching my memory, but I couldn't for sure say if I saw anything. Jordan isn't the type to believe in spooky stuff, but what he said scared me, so I decided to take the long way home and avoid valley.

I dropped Jordan off as his house and took a right out of his neighborhood to take the long way. About a mile from his house I was driving 45 mph and heard an incredibly loud and constant ""THUMP THUMP THUMP"" on my passenger door, like someone was knocking on the window angrily, asking me to roll it down. The thumping would not stop, so I did what any person in my situation would do, I screamed like a coward.

""AHH! AHH! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! GO AWAY!"" I Kept shouting as I sped up to outrun the invisible force. Finally I was forced to stop at a red light, and at the same time the pounding stopped. I mustered up my courage, got out of the car, and slowly walked over to passenger side. There, I saw that my friend Jordan had gotten my seatbelt buckle stuck outside of the car, and when I was driving it was slapping the side of car. Words cannot express the feeling of relief that flooded over me.

P.S. This is completely unrelated but over this past few days of discovering nosleep I feel like I've done some permanent damage to myself haha. Crazy things have happened in my life but others stories that activate my imagination are wayyy worse for some reason. I've stayed up until 5 AM for the past two days, only sleeping when my body shut down. I'm gonna buy a baseball bat later today and start leaving it next to my bed.

68,The Hallway,1299540977,"Ok, just a quick one before I go to dinner:


Back in college, I lived in a relatively nice four bedroom apartment with two friends I knew since childhood and one buddy we met in college.  The layout is kind of important here, so I’ve included a [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/V6S0F.png ""Seriously, it's just a diagram. No surprises, I promise!"").  Notice that my desk is right by the door and facing the bedroom of friend # 1.

Being three college guys, we tended to burn the midnight oil quite regularly.  I blame the internet.  Also, we were all pretty good friends, so 95% we left our doors open unless we were sleeping (the other 5% was for… *personal* reasons).  As you can see by the expertly drawn diagram, I occupied the first bedroom in the hallway.  This meant I would always see when people went into the living room or the kitchen and whatnot.


So one night we’re going about our business just wasting time on the computer.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  I had my headset on and I was playing TF2, not really paying attention to anything.  I lost track of time, and before I knew it, 2:45 AM rolls around.  The server I was playing on was basically dead, so I decided to call it quits.  I took off my headset and proceeded to dick around on the internet some more.


My door was open and the hall light was off, but I figured at least one of my buddies was still awake, seeing as how I was usually the first person to fall asleep.  Sure enough, a few minutes later I see somebody walk by my door and head in the direction of the other bedrooms.  This wasn’t the typical creepy “see something out of the corner of your eye for a fleeting moment” thing; I literally saw the movement of someone walking by my doorway with my peripheral vision.  I remember this distinctly because at this point I wasn’t weirded out in the slightest – my mind basically just registered the event as “oh hey, so-and-so must be heading to bed”.


I waited and listened to hear if whoever walked by was going to close their bedroom door.  If they didn’t, that basically meant it was fair game for me to wander into their room and chat it up with them before I turned in for the night.  Again, normal behavior here.  I waited for about 20 seconds and heard nothing, so I got up and turned the corner into the hallway.


All the bedroom doors were already closed with no light spilling out from under any of the doors.


I immediately stopped in my tracks and shuffled quietly backwards into my room and shut the door.  I was so put off by the whole incident that I made an executive decision to skip brushing my teeth that night; I didn’t want to go back out in the hallway until the sun came up.",nosleep,Lights_Out,/r/nosleep/comments/fzd4s/the_hallway/

73,Nimble-fingered devils? (apologies),1299534692,"This past Thanksgiving, I met up with all of my mom’s side of the family. I have    several cousins that I rarely see (every 5-6 years), and have pretty much lost touch with apart    from the occasional Christmas card or update from my mom. That being said, I learned a lot about    that side of my family during this trip -- a lot that my parents had decided not to tell me    growing up. Definitely some of the creepiest shit that I’ve ever heard.


The one that stuck with me the deepest happened to my cousin about a year ago.    She’s about 25 at the time, living with a girl that she’s been close friends with for a long time,    someone she went to school with. I say that to emphasize the fact that this is a girl my cousin    knew well and trusted, and not someone who would make things up for attention.


As my cousin tells it, a few little things started happening semi-regularly. The first    she remembers is a heavy, heavy smell of cigarette smoke sort of wafting by the couch in the    middle of the living room. This happened several times, even though neither of them smoked    inside the house. Weird, but not really that big of a deal.


The next part she described was a little less subtle. My cousin’s home alone in the    house, just out of the shower. She walks from her bathroom down the hall to her roommate’s    to use her blowdryer, but before she plugs it in she hears the faucet running in the bathroom she    just came from. She doesn’t remember leaving it on, so she goes back to turn it off, and ALL    of her stuff has been thrown all over the place. The cabinets and drawers are open, and    everything that was on the sink is all knocked over and strewn about the floor. Like someone just came    in and swept it all off with their hands. This freaked her out quite a bit.

 
There’s quite a few other things that happened in between that and this next one, but    this is the one I really wanted to mention -- I haven’t been able to get it out of my mind. A    few weeks after the bathroom deal, my cousin comes home to find her roommate sitting on the    couch in the living room, arms folded, with a piece of paper sitting on the coffee table in    front of her. Her roommate is just seething with anger, points to the sheet of paper, and asks,    “Why would you do this?” My cousin has no idea what she’s asking, so she walks over and picks    up the sheet of paper.


Turns out her roommate walked into her room and found that sheet of paper laying    face down on her desk. The whole page is typed, neatly, and at the top is a creepy verse from    Revelation. I don’t remember it specifically, but something about demons. Then there’s a list    of about thirty different names of demons and devils, some fairly common -- Beelzebub,    Mephistopheles, Lucifer -- but mostly super obscure, stuff that she had never seen before. At    the bottom, there was printed a small picture of a devil, right next to a small picture of an angel.


What’s extra creepy about this is that the page was printed on the roommate’s    unique letterhead. This paper wasn’t even in the printer, but locked in her roommate’s desk drawer.    In order for someone to do this, they would have had to find a way to unlock that drawer, put    the letterhead into her printer, then make a document on her computer and print it out.

 
So, upon hearing this, I’ve narrowed it down to one of two possibilities:    1) psycho roommate or 2) holy shit, I have no idea. I know my cousin wouldn’t make this up for the    hell of it, and she seems convinced that her roommate wouldn’t either. All I know is that it    weirded me the hell out.

75,Phone call from hell?,1299533384,"So when I was 9, I used to live in this house in the country side, we had neighbors but they were somewhat far (this probably irrelevant, but I thought I'd mention since now we moved). But at this time I used to have the scariest nightmares nd everynight I would sleep with my head under the blanket thinking that if I couldn't see anything I would be safe. Well anyways we used to get a lot of phonecalls however, ALL of them were from relatives/family friends, my mom would always answer the phone. But one day she was sleeping and the phone rang, I never wanted to answer it but she was too lazy and told me to get it, so I pick up the phone and I hear someone say, ""wait for me to..."" At this point I'm scared as shit and I hang up the phone, the second time it rings like 10 minutes later, my mom picks up it was my mom's friend. A couple years later after I forgot about the previous incident the phone rings again, same circumstances (mom was sleeping made me answer it) I heard the same voice (sounded like an old sick man) and I hung up after the same words were said, after that I never answered the phone again. To think of it a lot of creepy stuff happened in the house, I forget mot of it, but I remember I used to be scared everynight, and I was really happy to finally move out.

78,Homebuying ,1299526540,"So, when I was about 20 and getting ready to buy my first home, I started looking in the paper, with my job and savings it looked like I could only afford a home in the 70,000 range. A few months of research and looking it was about time I started going to see these places and making my choice. Most of the home I was looking at were Pre-Fabs, or Nicer mobile home, 1 stuck out, it was a stick build 2200 sq foot on 3 acres of land, it was build in the 70 but the ad said it was up to code the price though caught my eye $50,000 (this was while it was still a seller’s market on the home) Well at a price like that I had to at least check it out. 
	Doing my homework on the place I looked up resent sell values for homes in the area, all of them sold for at least 150k or more. I guess this should have been a big red flag. I call up the realtor and set a date to look at the home. 
	We met up with the realtor at a nearby gas station, she lead us in. My first impression of the home from the outside was nice. It need its lawn mowed and hedges cut but no major chipped paint on the shutters, and since it was a brick home I made carful note that there was no majorly damaged bricks or bad grout that I would have to replace. The realtor had a key for only the backdoor so as we were making our way around I took careful note of neighbors that was out, and any stray dogs that I saw as well. The backyard wasn’t kept up well, there was the remain of a old above ground pool in the back yard made of wood, as well as a chicken coup and a shed. There was a stream nearby I could hear the water flowing down it. 
	We went in to the back door, inside had no order but it was HOT, they didn’t keep the ac on and since it was 87 outside it was nice and warm inside. Luckily the power was still on and the ac control was near the door so we cranked up the ac while we were there. The back door lead in to a bigger room on the side of the home, this room look like a rec type room the laundry room was also off the room. The kitchen was the next room we went to, you had to go thru the kitchen to get to this room. The kitchen has other doors in it, 1 that lead to a hallway where the bed rooms where the other was in to a dining room, next to the dining room was the main livening room. There nothing much of note to the dining room. The Living room had a large window that faced the front yard. The wall paper on the wall wasn’t peeling, and no leak in the roof I could see. The kitchen needed a new fridge and oven but that was the only thing I saw wrong thus far. 
The hallway to the bedroom there were 4 door on that hallway, the first door we came to lead to the basement, I go down there to inspect the foundation. All seem well; a motorcycle out of the 40 was in the basement as well. It was black and very dusty, but it looked as if it would work if given the right TLC. I went back up stairs. The next 2 room we when to was bed room, large ones at that 14x14 at lest.  We came to the last door on the hallway, this door would open with ease, but open without having to kick it down. The room struck me as odd, it was very dark in there.  It was very bright outside, and it didn’t make much sense that this room be so dark. We walked in the room. After we were in the room I turn on the light switch. We heard a scream; “NOOOOOOOO” coming for the hallway, as in the room we felt moment but didn’t see any, the door to the room slammed shut and the light was turned off. Me and the realtor both jetted for the door to the room which was stuck with such a force that I had to kick it down to open. Running thru the hallway again we saw on the floor what looked to be a puddle of fresh blood, this was right outside of the basement door. We were now bolting to the door. We made it outside. I saw in the broken down pool the motorcycle I saw the the basement before, it was rusted and weather as it was out in the sun for years. Me and the realtor got in our car and as we were back out I foolish looked back what I saw I will always see. The pained shutters now had paint peeling off, a few bricks were missing and thru the window of the living room I saw him, a faceless grin, a suit and tie, and impossibility long arm reaching for me.

79,Two ghost stories from my childhood. ,1299526350,"When I was around 4 years old, my family was looking into buying a new house. My parents wanted to move away from the rest of the family so they could follow their own path in life; consequently, the house we were looking at was rather far away. Being that I was so young, they had to take me with them.

I don't remember much about the ride over to the house, but I do remember when we got there. The house had two floors, the top floor was for the owners and the bottom floor was to be rented out as a basement suit. The realtor led us into the house and I remember it being completley empty, although it had a rather pleasant aroma of cookies. I remember an elderly women came out from the kitchen. She had white hair and a pleasant smile, she was quite frail looking. I remember she had a plate of freshly baked cookies in her hand. I enthusasitaclly tugged at my mom's shirt to ask if I could have a cookie, but she was in the middle of a conversation with the realtor. I don't remember anything else that happened while we were looking at that house. 

Years later my mother and I were reminising about when I was young and I complained I never got to try one of the old woman's cookies. My mother's eyes got wide and she told me that there has been no one in the house when we went to look at it, but the preveious (and only) owner of the house had been an old woman.




Another story I have about that house (we ended up buying it) is perhaps a bit more scary. I was still around the age when monsters and terrifying creaturs pleagued my dreams, so I normally slept with my bedroom door open.

My bedroom was at the end of the house with the bathroom and my parent's bedroom on either side of it. I was playing with my stuffed animals in bed when I felt that there was something watching me. I felt my neck break out in goosebumps as I made myself look at who was standing in my doorway. 

I remember it being an extremley bright figure, with really hollow looking eyes. The illuminated figure stretched its arm out to me, as if beckoning me closer. 

""Jessica,"" I heard it whisper to me. ""Come with me. Come with me and we'll be happy."" 

It's voice sounded a lot like my mother's, but I knew it wasn't. I covered myself in the blanket and yelled for my mom. She came rushing for me, and I asked if she had been standing in my doorway, she said she hadn't and that no one had been.


When I saw the movie The Lord of the Rings later in life, I remember being shocked at how similar [these guys](http://images.wikia.com/lotr/images/7/7c/Weathertop-Nazg%C3%BBl.jpg) in the movie looked to how I remembered the image in the doorway.

	Turns out her roommate walked into her room and found that sheet of paper laying face     down on her desk. The whole page is typed, neatly, and at the top is a creepy verse from     Revelation. I don’t remember it specifically, but something about demons. Then there’s a list of about     thirty different names of demons and devils, some fairly common -- Beelzebub, Mephistopheles,     Lucifer -- but mostly super obscure, stuff that she had never seen before. At the bottom, there     was printed a small picture of a devil, right next to a small picture of an angel.    


	What’s extra creepy about this is that the page was printed on the roommate’s unique     letterhead. This paper wasn’t even in the printer, but locked in her roommate’s desk drawer. In     order for someone to do this, they would have had to find a way to unlock that drawer, put the     letterhead into her printer, then make a document on her computer and print it out.     


	So, upon hearing this, I’ve narrowed it down to one of two possibilities: 1) psycho     roommate or 2) holy shit, I have no idea. I know my cousin wouldn’t make this up for the hell of     it, and she seems convinced that her roommate wouldn’t either. All I know is that it weirded me     the hell out.

82,Weird thing when I was a kid.,1299523187,"When I was a 5 or 6 I used to see things sometimes. We lived in military housing in Japan, that's probably not important but I thought it might be relevant because these things stopped happening when we moved back state side. The weird part was I had to be looking through a crocheted blanket, something like [this](http://www.knitting-n-crochet.com/images/Baby-blanket-crochet-patterns-4.JPG). Mostly I would see female legs in stockings. They would walk across my field of view as I looked through the holes in the blanket. If whipped the blanket off of me, they would be gone, put the blanket back on and after a few minutes of playing under the blankets they would be back. 

They seemed to always show up when I didn't expect it. I usually would be playing under the blanket and then notice them in my peripheral vision, after I noticed them I could look straight at them. It also wasn't always the same blanket, we had a fair number of them made for us by various family members, all of whom were still alive at the time, but it was always the same pair of legs. Occasionally I would here a female voice calling my name from another room shortly after the legs went by, I remember thinking this was my Mom but also thinking that the voice was different. 

Whenever I went towards were the voice sounded like it was coming from there was no one there. Whenever I asked my Mom if she had called me when this happened she would say no, most of the time she was even in the exact opposite direction from the origin of the voice. 

This didn't really scare me but it bothered me a lot. I had asked my Mom before if she had just been in the living room and she would say no and sometimes ask me why. I usually just told her something non-committal. I remember finally breaking down and telling my Mom about seeing the legs and hearing the voices and she waved it off as me just telling stories. I tried talking to my Dad about it too, but he pretty much ignored me. 

I would dismiss all this as an over-active imagination if it weren't for one thing. I had a little brother too, he was about 2 or 3 at the time, so he couldn't really talk but we would play under the blankets together and sometimes he would squeal ""MAMA!"" when I could see the legs. 

Thinking back on this I find it pretty creepy now, this is one of my most vivid memories from back then, I can't really remember a whole lot about that time frame, but this always pops up in my mind when I think about it. Anyone else remember seeing things like that when they were a kid?",nosleep,f1gm3nt3d,/r/nosleep/comments/fz6g1/weird_thing_when_i_was_a_kid/

86,Just watched all of Marble Hornets with people who never saw it...,1299513151,"The series is great on Youtube, but if you have the bandwidth and time, I recommend downloading each video, splicing them together, burning it to DVD, turning every single light off inside, then watch it on a big TV.

My friends are from all over my state, but being Mardi Gras, they came back home and I threw a party.  Since most don't have the attention span to sit and click through the Youtube videos, I pulled the videos off Youtube with [KeepVid](http://www.keepvid.com), all in FLV format since the resolution was a bit higher, converted them using [AVS Video Converter](http://www.avs4you.com/AVS-Video-Converter.aspx?sct=inc&amp;ct=keepvid&amp;cid=58), which converted them to MPEG and created a seemless video from Intro to Entry 36 along with every ToTheArk response following the respective Entry.  The free version of this adds a watermark and the paid version is like $40 and $60.  I bought the latter because I like to do video conversions and authoring projects.  I burned a video disk using free software on Linux, which froze in the middle of Entry 26 the first night, and we managed to finish the last bit last night.

When I first saw it, I was incredibly unnerved, but watching it on TV with zero lights and with everyone discovering it together was quiet an experience.  I'm not one to really scared of movies, and I believe I legitimately screamed at one point (this could also be due to my friend who is very skiddish and would scream at random things).

Since this is NoSleep, I'll end this with a creepy bit.  I just posted this to try to spread the word on what I consider the best way to view this movie yet.

We watched it Saturday with some friends who came over for a party (different than those who came specifically to watch this).  A tornado had passed earlier that day, took power out for several hours, and when it came on, our motion sensor would come on and off repeatedly for about an hour.  This is a testing system to make sure it works.  In the middle of Marble Hornets, I noticed that the light was staying on a bit long than the previous testing cycles.  Then went off all together for about 10 minutes.  Then, it came on for the normal duration of if there was movement.  Then never came back on.  Very unsettling.

87,Something tried to escape my dream that night,1299512001,"I recount this dream several times a year: the vivid detail and sensations reverberate in my head and I'm forced to relive the experience once the memory triggers. This happened 7 years ago when I was 18, and to this day I am still terrified that I should ever have this same dream again.

It was the summer after my senior year of high school, before college, and my friends from high school were still all in town. We knew we'd be all going our separate ways shortly, so our rather sizable group of 10 or so were trying to spend as much time with each other as possible. Being a geeky bunch, we would often do all-nighters watching movies, playing games and generally goofing around, courtesy of whichever unlucky parent had willingly volunteered to allow the crew in for the night.

On this particular night we had gotten together at one friend's house with a finished and fully functional basement. We stayed down there for the most part barring food/drink trips since we'd wake the parents in the night if we weren't in the basement.

Well, 4 AM rolled around and we were starting to feel a bit tired, on top of the fact that our last movie of the night had ended 20 minutes ago, so we made the silent agreement to kill the lights and hop in our sleeping bags.

For whatever reason, I was feeling particularly drowsy, and despite the fact that we would usually just talk and laugh for a while after lights went out, I found myself drifting in and out of consciousness while listening to everyone else talk. My friend Rory started telling one of his many stories and generally being a goof, much to all our amusement, as I felt my eyes grow heavier and heavier.

I was nearly passed out mid-story, when suddenly I felt a chill creep up my body as if the temperature in the basement had plummeted to near freezing in only a second's time. Simultaneously, Rory's voice started fading out to nothing, and as it faded, began to echo against the walls as if we were in a fully enclosed concrete room. It sounded like it would have if you were talking in a large parking garage.

Curled up in my sleeping bag with the top now pulled over my head (half out of the cold sensation, the other half out of slight fear), I darted my eyes open with the fatigue gone now. I could hear my own breathing heavy in my little cocoon, and very slowly pulled my head out of the sleeping bag. My eyes still open, all I could see was pitch blackness, not having been adjusted yet. Still, dead silence besides my own breathing as Rory's voice had faded completely out. I couldn't hear movement from anyone else in the small room, nor see them due to the darkness.

And then I heard it.

*step*

A firm, intentional step, distinct though faint like a wingtip shoe on hard cement. The step echoed throughout the room like Rory's voice had, as if reverberating across cement walls and floors. I held my breath and waited for anyone to react. What felt like minutes passed.

*step*

Again, faint but precise. It sounded far away. Farther than the room could have possibly been big. I'd slept in this basement before. There were no side rooms, and the only windows were those small ones that allowed emergency escape and ventilation. The sound was definitely coming from within this small room, yet from much farther than it could have possibly been.

*step step step*

The steps, still far away, turned into a deliberate, slow walk. I shivered again as the cold from before intensified, and I strained to adjust my eyes that were still cloaked in pitch, though I knew my attempts were futile.

*step step step step*

Far away but louder, it was apparent that this noise's source was moving closer and I pulled the covers up over my head out of sheer terror. Despite my sleeping bag being pulled over my head, I could still hear the sounds as distinct as before.

__*step step step step*__

Oh fuck, it's running now in a full on sprint. The steps are still echoing loudly and they're approaching us. No... no they're approaching *me*. 

__*STEP STEP*__

One final pair of heavy steps. Although I couldn't see anything with my head under the sleeping bag, the sound proximity tells me that whatever this thing is, it was standing at my feet.

I closed my eyes and slowly retracted my head from the sleeping bag covers, looking straight up. I held my breath and decidedly opened my eyes.

In what I can only describe as a single nanosecond, still seeing nothing except the pitch black, a darker-than-black form, malefic and haunting lurched forward at me with an open maw, it's arms thin and jagged reaching out to pull me inward. In this exact same instant, I'm awake and sitting up violently in my bed, at *home*, with moonlight illuminating my room and the faint trace of a black form passing in front of my face, as if it had just passed through my upright form and I was catching a glimpse of the tail end of it.

I did not go back to sleep that night. ",nosleep,LZFX,/r/nosleep/comments/fz275/something_tried_to_escape_my_dream_that_night/

89,"Three nights, three nightmares, three variations",1299509651,"Several nights ago I dreamed the first variation of this dream. It didn't seem to hold any significance at the time, but now I've had two more dreams on the same subject, each one slightly different from the others. They're like one of those ""choose your own ending"" stories.
Many would call these dreams a nightmare. They're certainly very unpleasant, but in all three variations, although I am very much a participant in the action, a part of me is detached, watching the dream unfold much in the same way as a person who is reading a novel is involved and yet detached. A part of my mind remains disconnected, in third-person perspective.

Night #1. Our family is on a day trip visiting some sort of a livestock farm, touring the barns and buildings. We're there to learn how the farm operates. I am only vaguely aware that one of our sons is with us. (We have two sons, ""I"" and ""G,"" but I'm not sure which son it is in the first dream.) Although that son is a catalyst for the action in the story, the dream is about me... and mostly about my wife, ""C."" She is the focus of the story.

In the course of touring the farm, C and I somehow come by some awful information: our son is going to grow up to do something horrible. He will become a bloody dictator or cause nuclear annhiliation to occur... something horrific and monstrous. I don't know how we come by the information, but it seems that it was a supernatural kind of revelation. The realization is not specific or sudden, but we are fully pursuaded that it is inescapably factual. We know what we have to do. As repugnant as we may find it to be, we both realize that we have no choice but to kill him in order to prevent what is otherwise sure to occur.

Resolved, I pick my son up in my arms and begin running through the strange hallways of the farm buildings. When I get outside, I know what I will have to do. C is terribly distraught: she knows what I'm after. I am aware that in her heart of hearts she understands the necessity of what I'm doing. Although she knows what abandoning the plan means, she's nevertheless pleading with me to stop. I get outside, running with my son in my arms up the gravel road to carry out the awful deed when I realize that C, running behind me, has all but lost her mind. As with determination I begin to follow through with the plan of killing our son, I am causing her to go mad. The awful thought dawns upon me: I cannot save the future world and, at the same time, preserve C's sanity. And so I put my son down next to me on the road and calmly walk back to C. I take her hand and smile at her. She smiles at me. Everything returns to normal, and we are a family once again. The thought of killing my son is gone, and my wife's sanity is returned. But I realize in my heart of hearts that I am making an reckless decision at the expense of hundreds of thousands of future lives.

Night #2 I dreamed a variation of that same dream, the details of which are much less clear. We are once again at the farm, and I am frantically rushing away from C, out of the farm buildings with ""G"" in my arms (this time, I'm sure which son it is). He is dressed in something orange. This time C quickly recedes into the background as I run. I am aware that she is horribly distraught, screaming and crying, but that she cannot keep up. With every step I take, I can see my son mentally and physically deteriorating in my arms. The closer I get to the outside, the worse his physical condition: his skin becoming more and more pale, his eyes sinking further into his head, the circles that have formed under his eyes becoming darker, deeper, blacker. It is my rushing him out of the building that is killing him. It is my resolve to remove him from the building -- not some horrific act that I will have to commit once I'm outside -- that will kill him. And so I relent. I stop and turn back -- and I see him becoming himself once again as I make my way back to C.

Night #3. We are again at that same farm, touring it during the day as an educational family outing. In the process of touring, I find myself alone with C in a smallish, dark area, the ceiling of which is high enought that I can't tell how many floors lie above us. I don't know where our son is. I can see strange, old stairs behind her leading up into the darkness, dark walls, dark floor, meager light provided by a bare bulb hanging from a long, crooked wire. C is not ""C."" She is my wife, but as I recall the dream, I realize that she does not look or act like herself in any respect. I ask C to relate to me the story of the ""Gustafson sisters."" I want to know: how is she like them? What common connection does she share with them? I ask at least partially aware that that my question is an insidious one, that there's some degree of malevolence to it, something that I know will force C to ponder something very unpleasant. There's something -- something in the back of my mind of which am only partially aware -- something that ties whoever the Gustafson sisters are with what is a perilous and painful catch-22 situation for C. I know it has something to do with the theme of killing/not killing our son, of making a selfish choice for ourselves that puts countless human lives in jeopardy. I see C react badly to the question, almost as if something snaps inside of her. Her face goes wrong and her body begins twitching in an odd and disconcerting way. I take it as a warning sign that my question has caused something to go badly wrong, that something is about to go much worse -- something that, if I do not provide a remedy, will gravely and permanently injure her psychologically.

Instinctively I know that getting C outside will remedy the bad process my cruel question has begun in her, and so I quickly begin leading us out of the building. I begin leading us through familiar and yet somehow unfamiliar corridors of the farm buildings. I have her by the hand, leading her and trying to reassure her with my words and my manner. I notice that she has a worried, harried, unnerved look in her eye. And then I realize that, while I am currently choosing the right exits, I am quickly becoming more and more confused as to where we are, or where we're to go next. My ability to continue choosing correctly is quickly fading. The angles of the corridors turn at sharp right angles, doorway after doorway: a left, a right, a right, another left... and then I realize that I am no longer the one making the choices; it is C who is leading, as if with sort of a preternatural instinct. She is the one choosing the path, and I am grateful for her help. I recognize that she's doing for us what I can longer do, and so I go with her willingly. The path feels right, feels right, feels right... and then quickly begins to feel more and more wrong. At last she leads me into what I know is a wrong door, into a pitch-black hallway... and it's there that she kills me. As I die, I realize that this was the only solution that could leave her sane. If I had lived, I would have had to kill our evil son. But if I had killed our evil son, she would have gone insane. And so C had no choice but to alter the present in order to preserve the future.",nosleep,musictechgeek,/r/nosleep/comments/fz1fj/three_nights_three_nightmares_three_variations/
90,Writers and Readers of NOSLEEP. It'd be amazing if you would critique my creative nonfiction assignment first draft. [The Elders],1299506714,"[linky to the story](https://sites.google.com/site/uploadzone721/public/TheElders.pdf)


This is a submission for my Creative Non-Fiction course. I would love it if you guys would rip it apart for me. It's my one and only truly nosleep worthy story.


This is only my second time I've ever done any form of creative writing. I'm not looking to be bashed and told not to write, just looking for some constructive criticism if you guys are up to that kind of thing.


Here's what I would like to know:

Are the characters developed enough?

Does the past tense work for you or do I need some scene in present tense to help with the suspense (or anything else to help with the suspense of it all)?

Is there enough reflection?

Is there enough description (is there anything you can't visualize)?

Do I seem credible/honest?

Are you confused at any point?

Is the title really fucking lame?

Do you see a physical and figurative journey from the author?

Is the dialog believable?

Anything else you think I should hear.


I'm not worried about grammar issues. It will be proofread for grammar/spelling many more times.


Oh, after you read you should google the location. There's some interesting youtube videos and stories from ghost hunting sites about the location I wrote about.

92,Groundhog Day,1299497663,"The alarm went off loudly. Before it could even let out a second cry I slammed it into silence. The clock read 6:41, but the window looked like 3 AM. It was raining. I lay there staring out at the blackness and listening to the rain tapping- wanting to be let in. I sat up. I rubbed my eyes. 6:42. I was sitting there what seemed like a long time, staring at the knife I kept on my bedside table ever since someone broke into my house last year. I looked at the clock again and it changed to 6:43.

And then I heard footsteps coming down the hall. I stared into the dark at the door standing half open as the shuffling feet of someone cautiously coming down the hallway grew closer. The door swung open the rest of the way quickly and there was a man standing in the opening, masked by the shadows. He took a step forward and I could see even through the dark he was confused.

I didn't hesitate. As he moved towards me I moved towards him and in a single motion grabbed the knife and stabbed it into his side. Blood shot out and for some reason this surprised me. The intruder collapsed, and I looked at the clock again. 6:43 changed to 6:44. Without thinking I put myself through the motions to go and wash the blood off me, even to brush my teeth. I stared in the mirror, frightened- and decided I had to go back to my room and call the police. My alarm went off again, I figured I must have hit the snooze button.

The door was half open as I approached it, shuffling. I opened it and was confused for a moment. The man wasn't on the floor dead, he was in my bed. He was still moving- still alive! I moved as quickly as I could to get to him but he was faster- picking up a knife off the bedside table. I looked at the clock as he sunk the knife into my side. The rain tapped on the window, wanting to be let in. The clock seemed to scream 6:43 at me. How odd.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fyykm/groundhog_day/

98,A true ghost story that fucked with my childhood.,1299484568,"When I was five, me, my one year old brother, my mom and my dad moved out of Atlanta to a suburb just northeast of the city. The house was your run of the mill, shoddily made Pulte home. It was two stories tall, had crappy siding made out of that material that rots really easily (don't know what it's called, but it's not wood) and was affordable for us as a middle-class family.

Anyway. The first two weeks there, I had to sleep on the floor with nothing more than a blanket and a pillow until the third week when my mom finally bought me a bunk-bed.

It was the first night on this bunk-bed that I found myself randomly awoken around 12am for no particular reason. Light was shining under the door and someone was in the hall. Immediately after this, I looked up and across my barren room to see a tall, shadowy figure standing in the middle of the floor. Immediately, my heart froze.

Being deadly afraid of whatever ""it"" was, I turned around, put the blanket over my head, and and attempted to muster the courage to yell, for about an hour. Finally, I began hollering at the top of my lungs for one of my parents.

Suddenly, my dad busts in and sees me, I am utterly relieved. What he said next was something I did not need to hear.

""Did you see it too?"" I sat there silently for a moment.

""No."" I lied.

Either way, he slept on the top bunk, and startled, we both went back to sleep.

During my ten years in that house, we saw multiple ""things."" The worst one came some years later when I was sleeping on the couch beneath our balcony that overlooked the den and living room and saw two bright white heads, like children, staring down at me. I nearly crapped my pants.

The last thing I remember seeing was a tall, slender shadow that moved along the wall and disappear. 

I went to school and bought dozens of ghost books and studied them as much as possible. I then read somewhere that cats kept the ""spirits"" away, so I got two cats with my moms permission. Sure as shit this actually worked.

The last real thing that happened, as I remember, was someone whispering my name as I walked by the room where I had seen the ""figure"" and one of the cats walking out of a door purring as if someone had been playing with it followed by the door, which was hollow and made from balsa wood (thus physically impossible to slam), slamming violently, the cat didn't budge. Luckily, the entire family was there for that.

The worst part was that it wasn't until we moved that my mom admitted to seeing those ""things"" too, she even named some of them that I hadn't had the courage to tell her about, but she never talked about it so she didn't scare my brother. She was even more startled when she got the place tested for carbon monoxide and came up short.

I talked to a friend years later and he said that it might have something to do with low wave frequencies and air pockets. I chocked it up to this, and to this day, I no longer believe in that stuff. However, there's no denying what we all saw and how creepy it was. I still have extremely vivid dreams about that place to this day and that dark shadowy figure standing in doorways and just staring at me in silence.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fyvyj/a_true_ghost_story_that_fucked_with_my_childhood/
99,The Sleep Paralysis.,1299483205,"This started several years ago, when I was around twelve (I am 26 now). Every night, I would go to sleep, in my soft, warm, comfy bed. Off to dream of wondrous things a boy my age would dream. 

Instead, I dreamed of horrific things. Monsters that Hollywood themselves could not imagine. Deep, dark, dank spaces with no where to escape from. And then, I would wake up, but, I could not move. Like I was strapped to my bed and gagged, I could not move my body or make an audible noise. Eventually I would drift back to sleep, safe and secure once more. 

Over the years, this continued happening, but it was harmless, I would just wake up, be unable to move, then go back to sleep. However, it was affecting my sleep pattern, so off to the doctor I was taken. He diagnosed me with sleep paralysis. I was placed on several medications, including Ambien. 

Over the years, this helped tremendously. I was sleeping well, not dreaming(or not remembering them)and most importantly, not being paralyzed. Until recently....

I've been on the same medications for years, and they have helped me more than I could had dreamed. However, a couple of  months ago, it came back. I was sleeping, having a nightmare, trapped inside an office building with this thing chasing me. It had long slender legs and arms, it's body was decomposing and had a mouth similar to a lizards. As I'm running away from it I slam into a brick wall. 

I woke up, or so I thought I did. I couldn't move, couldn't make a sound. My girlfriend was next to me completely unaware. And then, I saw it out of the corner of my eye. This...beast. It began climbing my walls, leaving a trail of slime where ever it went. It stopped on the ceiling, staring down into my frightened eyes. It's eyes...if you could call them that, were deeply sunken into it's face, with a slight bloody red dot where the iris should be. 

It spoke to me, in the most horrific voice I have ever heard. ""I will eat your body young one. I shall start with the toes, I call them piggies. From there I will work my way up to your chest, and eventually, your soul will be mine...once I reach your heart.""  After this, I snapped awake, able to move, but too frightened to go back to sleep.

Over the next few weeks from that experience, he has visited me, time and time again. Gnawing on my bones, slowly working his way to my chest. I usually snap out of it before he reaches my knees, the pain is there, and it is real. This last time, he reached my waist before I awoke. 

I sleep very little now thanks to my visitor. I am afraid. Afraid of what will happen when he reaches my chest. He hasn't reached it yet, but he gets further every time he tries.  The attempts have been spaced out now for a few weeks, but every time I sleep, I remember that voice. I remember the pain of it chewing through my flesh and bones. Help me..for I am afraid.

0,Recent nightmare. ,1299481867,"So the dream starts off with me being told by someone I wasn't acquainted with that I was in trouble, and my room was going to be checked by one of the administrative directors. I was in the Wilmer-Davis hall (my dorm building) but it was a lot larger. The hallways were wider and there were no lights. There was also a sort of gray haze in the building, like having your eyes half closed, despite rubbing or blinking you eyes.

I was supposed to meet the guy outside somewhere. It took me a while to find him. The place I found him reminded me of the back parts behind buildings where they keep dumpsters, but it has a sterile-hospital feel to it...if that makes sense. It was dark. And wet. And he was a very unpleasant person. We met up made our were at my dorm building. I don't remember what happened after I met him, just kinda skipped to the outside entrance of Wilmer-Davis. Once we walked into the hazy place I started to panic. I didn't recognize where I was, the wide and dark hallways didn't help. I thought it was weird that the guy wasn't bothered by it t all, more so irritated with my hesitation and the wasting of his precious time.

We made our way through a number of hallways and stairwells, but still couldn't find my room. Finally I felt like we had managed to make it to the right place. I told him to wait at the end of the hall while I went to make sure that my room was at the end. He stayed there, which surprised me a little bit, I figured he would follow thinking I would run off or something. He kept saying that he was going to find something and once he did, he would kick me out of the school. I found my room and unlocked it, then turned to tell him he could come over now. Except he wasn't there. It was really quiet. Then, as I was about to let go of the doorknob, the door flew open and something pulled me into my room. It pulled me hard by my arm, throwing me into my chair which flew against the wall as soon as I sat down. The door slammed. I couldn't see what did it, but I could feel it.

My room was a lot different. A lot smaller. My posters were the same except for a picture of a man wearing a weird mask, staring at me, directly in front of me. The first thing that came to mind when I saw the mask was an iron maiden -Just for the face instead of a full body thing. The face started to shake/twitch and his eyes got really wide.
I got up out of the chair and opened the door. I couldn't step out. Something was in front of me. I started to scream, hoping that the guy would return, or maybe one of the girls would wake up and help me. After i stopped screaming I heard a noise similar to cracking open a juicy crab leg. I looked to my right and saw the director laying face down on the floor. Something wasn't right about his body. I looked closer and noticed his face. And where it was. He was lying face-down but his face was up. His head had been twisted so many times it had left his skin in a wrinkled mess. His neck was even longer.
The thing was still in front of me but I couldn't see it. And I was still unable to get out. I started crying and the door across from me shot open. The girl came out and asked what was wrong. Before I could answer her she saw the mangled body of the director. As she was about to scream she was flung into the air and hit the ceiling. Another sickening crack and ripping noise and her body had been torn apart. Her blood poured down but the pieces of her body remained frozen on the ceiling. More people came out of their rooms to see what was happening. Before I could tell them to go back into their rooms, I was pushed back into mine. The door slamming in my face.

I was pushed back into the chair. This time something moved in front of my closet. I couldn't move, or speak, but I could hear the girls screaming outside of my room. More ripping. The thing out there was laughing. The closet doors started to open. Things started to come out of the walls and my coats hanging inside, making them move in a weird way. I couldn't see them either, but I could feel that they were bad. The face on my wall started to twitch again. The things were on my body and I couldn't move. I could feel them peeling off my skin...

And I woke up in complete darkness facing my closet. Couldn't work up the courage to look away, so I just stared at it in horror for a few hours before bolting out of my room.",nosleep,martar,/r/nosleep/comments/fyvc0/recent_nightmare/
1,I used to work in a creepy old retirement home. ,1299481771,"I used to work in a retirement home in the Marina district of San Francisco. I used to work the night shift and I hated it. Lots of stories about ghosts from my coworkers but i never really saw anything. The only creepy thing I personally saw was a picture whose eyes seemed to follow me. In any case it wasn't the things that i saw that creeped me out but the things that i didn't see. Once a resident in the facility started talking to thin air. She was waving for someone to come closer to her but there was nobody there. I asked her who she was talking to and she replied, ""tell that little boy to come closer"". I didn't think much about it because working in a retirement home meant there were some people who weren't exactly all there. I told one of my coworkers and they kinda laughed and said that the building used to be a home for battered women and children and the resident probably saw one their ghosts. Bricks were shat. Another time a resident was lying in bed talking. I was already a little creeped out about this so i reluctantly asked who they were talking to. He replied, ""oh that little boy on the ceiling"". I didn't even bother looking up. i just backed the fuck out of that room and ran like a maniac. I didn't even care if people thought i was nuts.

2,Recurring nightmare hopefully stays a nightmare,1299480763,"Its is very hard for me to be creeped out. Whether it be the dark, weird noises, a scary movie, I just don't get scared. I don't believe in anything paranormal either. Very mundane existence for nosleep. But i have a had a nightmare twice that i don't wish to ever have again. I will be in a large house, similar to my parents house but not exact, and outside will be dark and stormy but lit up by the often occurring lightning. The house is empty except for me but i know that something is outside coming for me. 

As I am walking up the stairs to my room I pass by a window and a large column of black smoke is there, almost in a human form but still quite ethereal and it speeds towards the window from far away but I run away before it hits the window. I make it up to my room and close the door and right as i do it is now right outside my window and even though i am absolutely scared shitless (and have shuddered several times already just writing this) I stare at it. It flies right towards the window and slams through the window and passes through me. Still scared out of my wits but in that reactionary flight or fight response I chase after it barely able to keep my legs beneath me.

 I chase it down the stairs knowing that it is flying towards my family's bedrooms but right as it reaches the living room it stops. Looks back at me. I stop. It screams and rushes towards me and I wake up. This is a nightmare mind you but it is so real. 

It just seems so coincidental. It first happened about a week ago and when i woke up I was scared still for about a half and hour. Usually when you wake up out of a nightmare the scared feeling goes away but this didn't. So a couple days ago I started asking my friends and people what their belief was about ghosts, basically to reassure myself. 

But i had the same dream last night. Exact same dream. I woke up and again couldn't shake the fear. I was so real and intrusive. I don't get scared about anything but this just terrifies me. I am so scared. I don't want to got to sleep again because I know i will get the same dream.

3,"True story, happening now - The Shed.",1299477687,"The wood creaks against the wind with a slow almost deliberate rapidity, yawning whines suddenly click like a knuckle knocking then silence, absolute silence until the gnawing of tiny teeth on wood somewhere below or the dripping of whatever's lightly falling upon the thin roof.  Another stretching creak starts with a snap to tighten all nerves, even though it's just wood in the wind no one could ignore it's tortured cries, all tense as the walls whisper their weakness.  
  
Inside it's warm, inside it's safe and secure and sensible.  Inside and outside only creaking, complaining wood away.  Wood which teeth take huge hungry bites from, wood which buckles and bends when strange creatures crash against it as they scurry through the hedgerow along it.  Creatures which sharpen their claws against the walls sending deep reverberating vibrations echoing through the inch or so of barrier.  Creatures which hiss and growl together, which throw themselves gnashing teeth and flailing claws in deadly combat all up against my shelters side.  
  
A large bird has landed on the roof, it pecks ominously as if preparing to breaks it's way into this plank and tar nut, preparing to rip my roof and rip my body up into the cold dark sky, into the shifting gloom of night which wriggles through my window.  something small squeals like a banshee from the bushes, claws rake as even the doom bird flees the screaming, hedgehogs mating is all it is - or most vile murder upon an innocent soul, could it sound any more horrific? the wheeling torment endless in it's assault on serenity only deepens, only grows more hideous.  A crack, wood above me wails and the walls call out as if broken but it was just a warning, a last warning for the next warning.

4,"Pretty inventive for an eight year old, I think.",1299477673,"This is my recounting of a somewhat disturbing dream I had, starting when I was a child. It would happen once every two years or so, with no rhyme or reason. 

Anyways. I would always find myself standing in a huge open field, full of beautiful red flowers. The sky was blue and clear, and there was a light breeze coming in from the west. At least, I just kind of felt it was west. I remember that clearly. 

In the distance, there was a large red barn. I felt compelled to go to it, whether I was being pursued or there was somewhere I needed to go, I can't tell. But this was a dream I never felt anxious or alarmed during. An indeterminate amount of walking, and I entered the barn. 

The interior I found to be laid out in a series of barriers, and in order to cross to the exit, I had to walk back and forth across, and slowly walk around each, almost like a lineup at an amusement park or fast food restaurant. 

The intervening period from the barn to the museum is always very blurry in my memory, but I really feel like something happens and time passes. 

I come upon a very large victorian style house. I enter and find there to be a museum of sorts, with different items on display and plaques describing them. I'm greeted by a very cheery gentleman who informs me I'm free to look around but asks me not to go upstairs. I also notice the staircase has a velvet rope blocking it off. 

Here is where I notice there are older looking men and women in pairs. They wear long white robes, almost nightgowns, and seem to glide along the floor as if floating an inch high. They don't speak and don't seem to have any expression at all. However, when you look straight into their eyes, it's as if a high powered flood light is pointing into your eyes from theirs. I ask the gentleman about them, and he tells me not to disturb them. After this point, I don't see him again.

Also at this point there is a friendly girl approximately my age. She leaves after a few minutes. I think she's simply a manifestation of my sexual frustrations at that point in my life, and not important. 

Anyways, I move onto another part of the museum, through a room with a dirt floor and large cement blocks I climb to enter the next door. It's another part of the house, but there are many more of the floating dead lights, as I've taken to calling them, with good reason. I notice one, a woman I suppose, moving down a hallway on her own, which is the first one not in a pair.

She enters a study of sorts, and at this point I notice there are beds lining the rooms. She stops at one and lies down. Closes her eyes and then a process of decomposition begins. Like somehow there's a strange preservation happening and when they lie down nature catches up. I see flesh necrotize, decompose, and finally slough off muscle and sinew. Which dries up, shrinks and disappears, leaving only a stained skeleton. All of this happens in about 10 seconds.

After they sleep, the process reverses, they get up, and start wandering again. The others sleep in pairs, and I spend the rest of the dream watching them go to sleep, wake up, then I switch to a new couple.

That's pretty much it. I don't have this dream any more, but I did for a period of about eight years. If you like this one, maybe I'll write about my other dream with a gentleman I call the Smiling Man. It's a lot shorter, but I find it a lot creepier.

6,On The Beach,1299475284," I'll start by giving you a slight background of the events leading up to this puzzling moment. At the time, i was 19 or 20. (Im 25 now) I had my two best friends with me, which actually both had the same first name as me. We went with nicknames to tell each other apart when we were with friends. Ill leave them out and just stick to the first letter. (The nicks were slightly offensive.)  
D is tall skinny black man with a poof ball for a head. His hair was always crazy but looked good. My other best friend O stood about 5'11 pale skin he wore glasses and had short hair. Both were more athletic than myself. I stood a mere 5'10 with pale skin and long straight dark brown hair that reached just under my shoulder blades.  
 We lived in Goleta, California, which is 10 minutes north of Santa Barbara. It's a beautiful on the beach-side community with the average temperatures 62 - 75 pretty much all year round. Like many teenagers we enjoyed the beach as well as beer and we use to have small bonfire parties there before the police started busting them up.(This particular beach was slightly over half a mile from houses and you had to walk over bluffs and through some trees) Not far from the area we lived at is a place called Isla Vista(IV is about a mile and a half from my house). It's a smaller town within the town. It's where most of the UCSB students live.(And party like freakin' rock stars.) Including my ex girlfriend and D's love interest. She lived in a two story house right on the edge of I.V. The parties rarely got to crazy that far from Del Playa. (Main party street)  
 During the day we had walked over to her house from mine, which on the beach takes about 45 minutes. We hung out messed around wondered through the streets until it got to be a little late. D's mom was fairly strict and called his cell and asked him to come home. It was around 11pm and even though the sun had set hours before it was still warm out.  
 We said our goodbyes to the girl and headed back to my place. Before long D and O both decided to smoke some weed. I personally had given the stuff up a few years before, but i had no problem with them smoking. So i waited five minutes while they smoked and then we hurried along the dark beach. I remember the moon wasn't out but it was a clear night. Off to our left we could see the oil platform two miles off the coast and behind it was the channel islands. To our right was a thicket of trees and thick brush.  
 We were laughing and making fun of D for flirting with my ex. ""Oh what a tangled web we weave"" i said to him. It didn't bother me in the least that they both took a liking to each other. In fact i was glad he was interested in a girl who was just as awesome as he was. They both giggled like school girls obviously pretty high.  
 It was around this time that it happened. Completely random and in mid-sentence D tripped over something. He fell flat on his face. Being the most awesome friends in the world, O and i cracked up. The beach was so dark out we couldn't see the sand we were walking on. D picked himself up and laughed about it. We started walking again, but D seemed a bit to quiet. So i asked him what the deal was. He said what he tripped over looked vaguely like a head. A horse head to be exact. Both O and i laughed at him again and teased him for being so high he thought he tripped over a horse head. We continued walking for about five minutes before curiosity got the better of me. I asked if they were interested and going back and taking a look at the clump of seaweed D and tripped over. They both were interested so we went back.  
 All we had was our crappy old flip phones for light. It wasn't good enough, but D had remembered he brought his digital camera with him. O yanked it out of his hands and moved up to the seaweed. Both me and D stood back while O squatted down and took the first picture. FLASH! We were all blind for a moment before everything came back into focus and we could look at the picture he had taken. It WAS a head! Or at least it really looked like it... He went in for another picture. FLASH! Blinded again, another three pictures and being blind before O screamed out, ""THERE'S A BONE POKING OUT AT ME!"" as he looked into the bright lit screen of the camera. O quickly shoved the camera into D's hand and moved away from the head. All three of us moved away as D stared into the screen. He flipped! He yelled and we all ran as fast as we could down the dark beach trying to get away from that thing! There was nobody within 3/4 of a mile of us in any direction! 
 Finally about five minutes later we had calmed enough to take a break from running in the sand. We could see a bonfire down the beach. We decided to not say anything and just get home as fast as possible and NOT look at the pictures til the morning.  
 Morning came and D came over. (O spent the night at my house) We took his camera and uploaded the pics from the night before to my desktop. We looked over them. We found the bone picture... Turns out it was the cord you wrap your wrist in so you don't drop the camera and damage or lose it. O was so high and the moment was so creepy he let his imagination go wild. We laughed at it and teased him, but the head still creeped us out.  
 To this day, going to that beach kind freaks me out a little.  

*Edit* Here are the pics O took.. For anyone whose got a weak stomach don't click these links. There's no blood but its still slightly unnerving.

7,The Ghost and the Moon,1299475276,"I am scared. I need help. Please. I've never really been a firm believer in ghosts. I was aware people go out to search for them, and there is a rather sufficient amount of evidence for it. However, something happened recently that has outright confused and scared me. I have met a ghost.
 
Or, at least the series of events that occurred were way too strange to comprehend.
 
In the very cloudy early morning hours of December 29th, 2010, something happened. I don't entirely remember what time, but it was definitely between the hours of 3 and 5. I was attempting to fall asleep, my cat by my feet, but I couldn't exactly sleep. So I rolled around trying to find a more comfortable spot to sleep. And then, it happened. I looked over towards where my Mac was, over by the corner of my bed, and slowly but surely, a faint image of someone was appearing. I had at first only thought it was nothing, just my eyes seeing things. But in time, the image of a little girl, about 4 feet tall, with black hair that was just past her shoulders appeared. I could see her perfectly clearly, and I did not even put on my glasses (as I was literarily frozen). She was dressed in a white gown. She had a very pretty young face, with what appeared to be either blue or grey eyes, but she looked at me with a very sad expression. I looked over to my cat, who was staring in the exact spot this ghost was apparently standing. The girl looked quite sad. I can't explain it, but that is just how she looked. She was simply looking at me. When she looked over at my cat, my cat slowly edged backwards and his tail poofed up, but he still stared at her. She looked back at me again. I had no clue what was going on. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.
 
But what happened next was too odd. It was too strange.
 
She turned her head and faced out my window for a few seconds, then turned her head back at me again. She did this a few times, as if to beckon me to look outside. Unsure of her intentions, I sat up to see what would happen. And the strangest thing truly happened. I sat up and looked out, and right when that happened, the clouds parted from the moon and it shone brightly into my room. I had no clue what was going on, and when I looked back, the ghost was gone.
 
I spent the next half an hour in bed, but I would eventually turn on all the lights in my room, walk around, put on my glasses and check out what happened. It was just too weird. 

So, I don't know. That was the strangest thing that has ever happened. It has gotten me a little paranoid, but I just don't know. I would dismiss it, but when the thing with the moon happened, and the fact she appeared so clearly even without my glasses on... I just don't know. It was too real. If anyone has anything that could possibly help me out with this, that would be cool. I am a little scared, and anything would help. She has not, however, appeared since. My house has not been around long enough for anyone to die, and no little girl has stayed in this area. I am 17 years old as well. If this helps, I also had a few days before the gotten a girlfriend.",nosleep,MartinGlow,/r/nosleep/comments/fytgm/the_ghost_and_the_moon/

15,A short story about my dream.,1299462133,"I know dream stories are not the scariest of things. But after i had this dream a couple of weeks ago i changed my mind. i didn't wake up in a hot sweat and a sudden jerk, but I just lay there thinking how incredibly scary this really was. Ghost and ghouls, murders and rapes scare me to death. But this would send would send me off the edge. 

(here's hoping some people feel the same)

The dream wasn't lucid, but i remember the sounds and each image very well which is unusual for me;

It was a sunny day, but ever so windy. So windy your hat would fly off. The surroundings were very unfamiliar, but if i had to describe it. My brain tells me it was like the coast of normandy france where men may of landed to fight to their deaths. However this place was my home, i was stood on the borderline of grass where it met the sand that stretched at least another quater of a mile to sea. 

I was stood on a stone patio, which had 2 walls either side, almost where people may sit and enjoy a drink. but there was no table or chairs. It was connected to a long path that lead up the grass, over humble hills and too a great mansion. It was definitely my home, but i've never seen this place in my life. I was young, wearing a straw hat. But i was also alone. I had a feeling like my parents were back at the house and they may of said to me ""don't run off far, make sure we can see you."" which i was doing, they would of seen a little figure stood watching the sea. 

I remember standing there watching it, the ocean that is. With every wave crash being crystal clear, joined well with the rustling trees that grew on the hills. I felt truly alone, I didn't look back at the house by this point, my eyes were fixated on the sea. It was a sunny day like i mentioned, but still clouds scattered the sky and that's what my eye's had been drawn too. The sky, I was happily watching them float by.

This is where my heart sunk, and i really felt it. There she was, floating, if not flying through the sky. no movement just a tall beautiful lady dressed from head to heels in a bright white gown. She was positioned so that her arms were flat by her sides, and her feet touched. But her body was tilted towards to me. She was just a tiny figure in the sky, i could just make out what i describe. But strikingly her hair flowed brilliantly in the wind, big with a chestnut glow. 
It felt so real, I could see her flying across the sky. I focused on her harder and harder, she was staring straight at me. She knew i was here, she knew i was looking at her. I felt fear like never before, she must of been a dozen miles away but she was staring at me like she was stood next to me. Her face was so strong and focused but she was smiling. I carried on trying to focus harder and harder to see her face better, but the harder i tried the more it looked like she was crying, her faced drenched in tears. She never broke the stare. . . 

I felt like i was there with her, but she still a million miles away. I felt like she was my mother and a witch. I've always been in a firm belief that dreams usually mean something, like a bad relationship or a fear. But this stuck with me as something more, maybe something important which i'll find out later.

I know some might not find this little story scary. But whenever i look up into the sky since that dream, i always wonder if i'm going to see a beautiful lady, floating with a deathly stare only made for me.

18,"Lights Out (longtime lurker, first time poster)",1299460570,"When I was just a little redditor, I used to be scared of the dark.  My mom and dad were nice enough to get me one of those little nightlights with a plastic blue and yellow striped fish faceplate that you could clip in front of the bulb.  To top it off, they always left the bathroom light on at the end of the hall so I wouldn’t have to stumble through 15 feet of darkness if I had to use the toilet.


Now, there comes a time in every kid’s life when they’re deemed “too old” for little fish-shaped nightlights.  It was time to grow up, and I wanted to prove I could be brave – just like Dad.  So one day after I got home from school, I unplugged my nightlight and left it on my parent’s bed.  Right before I crawled into bed that night, Dad came in and gave me a big hug.  He was smiling and I remember how awesome I felt seeing his face beam like that.  Shortly afterwards, Mom came in and gave me a big kiss and mentioned how proud she was.  She then nudged me with her elbow and whispered “don’t worry, I’ll leave the bathroom light on for you” and gave an over-dramatic wink.  They said goodnight, switched off the light, and shut my door.  Moments later, I saw the faint glow of the bathroom light outlining the bottom of my door.  Moms are good like that.


The night came and went without incident.


The next morning, I felt like a champ.  I was brave, just like Dad.  I could take on *anything*.  I hid in closets, crawled into the spot under the stairs, and covered myself up with the thickest blankets I could find.  I had faced my fears, and I was now in the process of making the dark my own personal biatch.  My parents were a bit confused, but they took it all in good humor and encouraged my newfound fearlessness.  My Dad even planned a trip to a nearby mine-turned-tourist-attraction, located about an hour and a half away from our town.  He said that he and Mom had taken the tour back before they got married and that at one point, the tour guides turned off all the lights.  He said it was the darkest thing he had ever experienced.  I asked him if he was scared and he just laughed.  “Of course not, but your mother hated it” he teased.  She rolled her eyes, smiled, and gave him a playful slap on the arm.


That weekend, we piled into the station wagon and headed off for the mine.  Dad was noticeably excited and he kept spouting off facts about the mine.  I was hanging on every word, grinning like a lunatic trying to imagine what this place would be like.  Mom just sat there in the passenger seat reading her book, effectively ignoring Dad’s constant stream of chatter.


Finally, in what I’m guessing was an attempt to test my newfound bravery, he casually mentioned that people claimed that the mine was haunted.  That’s when things started to go south.  **Parents, if your child has an overactive imagination and you’re about to subject them to approximately 30 seconds of complete and total darkness, please don’t put ideas in their head.**


I think Dad realized he had taken things a bit too far when he glanced in the mirror and saw that my smile had completely disappeared.  Mom immediately put down her book, sighed, and turned to glare at Dad.  He quickly covered with something about it “just being a story, and that ghosts weren’t even real” but the damage was done.  My imagination started to churn out all sorts of awful things.  I didn’t want to go anymore.


We got to the mine and we were grouped together with about half a dozen other people, which made me feel a lot better.  Safety in numbers, I guess.  Our tour guide introduced himself, but I don’t remember his name.  What I do remember, though, is that he was all dressed up like an old-fashioned miner: overalls, boots, gloves, and even one of those mining hats.  The only thing that didn’t fit the costume was his hefty looking metal flashlight he wore on his belt.  He told us that in the old days they used oil lamps, but that nowadays it’s much safer to use an electric light.  Technology marches on.


We got into the elevator and the tour guide started listing off some of the stuff Dad mentioned on the drive over.  The bravery fueled by the whole “safety in numbers” thing lost some of its effect as soon as the elevator started going down.


We started walking through the mine and I began to feel a little better.  We were in the middle of the group, so no ghosts could “sneak up on me”.  Plus, the whole mine was illuminated by those utility lamps that you see in hardware stores and it was actually quite bright.  Again, technology marches on.  


About 10 minutes into the tour, though, the tour guide started in with the whole ghost-story shtick.  One of the tunnels apparently had lethal levels of carbon monoxide and someone had died before they could evacuate everyone.  Again, I’m not sure what obsession adults have with scaring kids, but I really didn’t think that this was the time or the place for it.


I was getting visibly nervous when Dad shot me an “I’m sorry, kiddo” type glance.  Mom took a more personal approach and held my hand.  She looked worried for me.  It was almost time to turn out the lights.  I started breathing faster and I could feel my palms getting sweaty.  *I’m brave* became my mental mantra.  *I’m brave* – it’s just like the closet.  *I’m brave* – it’s just like the spot under the stairs.  *I’m brave* – it’s just like being under the blankets.  *I’m brave* – 


Click.


I clenched Mom’s hand and tried to look around, but it really was the darkest thing I had ever experienced.  Eyes open, eyes closed, it was all the same.  Some people were laughing nervously, and I instinctively turned and looked in their direction.  Still, it was useless; there was nothing but solid black all around me.


Then I noticed a faint glow, flickering like a candle.  It dimmed a little and then grew stronger, strong enough for me to clearly make out the faces of our group.  For some reason, that made me feel better at the time.  I could see that Dad and a few others were sporting shit eating grins, turning their heads like they were looking for something, *probably the source of the light,* I thought.  Another family in front of us held hands with their little girl.  Mom had a calm look on her face, but she kept her eyes shut.  I reached up with my free hand and gave hers a little pat and watched as a smile spread across her face.  I had done it again.  I was brave.


The tour guide flipped the lights back on and everyone blinked as they adjusted to the harsh utility lights.  Dad turned to me and gave me a pat on the back. “See?  That wasn’t so bad,” he said, still with that grin on his face.  Again, I felt like a champ.  The rest of the tour went by in a blur, and we stopped at the gift shop on the way out.  My parents offered me the chance to pick out a souvenir as a sort of coming-of-age type thing I guess.  I chose a battery operated light that looked like a miniature kerosene lamp.


Later that evening, as I was getting ready for bed, Dad again reassured me that none of that ghost-story business was real.  “Some people like feeling scared from time to time, so we all tell these stories so we can relive that feeling of being brave.  It feels good to be brave, doesn’t it?” he asked.  I nodded and placed my kerosene-esque lamp on my nightstand.  Mom came and sat on the edge of my bed as Dad got up to leave the room.  She laughed and said “that she hates being scared, and doesn’t understand why Dad thinks it’s so much fun”.  I told her it felt neat not being able to tell if your eyes were open or closed down there.  Again, mom laughed.  “I couldn’t tell; my eyes were closed the entire time!” she confessed.


“I know, I saw you!” I said.  She stopped laughing immediately.  My stomach dropped.  She shut her eyes slowly and bent down to hug me.  “Did you see a light?” she asked.  Again, I nodded.  She hugged me tighter.  “Please… don’t tell your father you saw it”.


She held me for a moment and I knew I had to be brave again.  “I’ll leave the bathroom light on for you,” she whispered.  She walked to my doorway and gave me one last smile.  There were tears in her eyes.  She turned off my light and shut the door.


Click.  I turned on my little kerosene lamp.  It had one of electric bulbs that look like a little flame that you see in some of those lights at Christmas time.

19,"""No one ever died here:"" Our Old House",1299460524,"A few summers ago we bought an old house in Brooklyn from the estate of a woman who had passed. She had a Polish housekeeper who was in the house when we visited a few times and she noticed that my wife was Polish and so they struck up a few conversations. One morning, as we were getting ready to sign the contract, the told us, adamantly and in Polish, that ""No one ever died in this house."" Fair enough, we thought, but it was pretty creepy and Slavic but we paid it no mind. There were a lot of cool old things in the house including a huge piano in the basement that they just left for us. It was a mess and barely played, but it was made in about 1896 according to the markings in the lid.

Fast forward to Christmas Eve of that year. I found out that our basement was leaking and while my wife was at work I went down there to check things out. Water was pouring through the rear wall and when I looked out the back window I noticed that there was a huge pool of water under a raised patio behind the house. I went out there, soaked myself to the gills in ice-cold water, and literally cursed the old woman who lived there for not taking care of her drains better. I was, needless to say, pretty upset and not very rational, but I unstuck the drain and the water stopped pouring in.

Christmas came and went and then, around New Year's, I started waking up at 3am every night to the sound of people downstairs. Sometimes it was just voices and other times is was a party with tinkling glasses and someone playing a piano. My dog woke with me every night and every night - 3am sharp - I'd go downstairs to check things out. It would be dead quiet. 

Night after night - 3am - voices - party. Rinse. Repeat. I was going crazy. Sometimes it wouldn't wake me and I'd sleep through it but the dog was always anxious. 

Now I never believed in ghosts but I could tell someone - a female - was in the house. She didn't like me (probably because I cursed her out) and she was situated around the piano. We found some old photos of folks at a party in our house, sitting on a couch with drinks in their hands under some lamps that were still on the wall in our living room. It was as if she were reliving some good times in the house at my expense. It was also clear that the piano had been upstairs before because of some painting on the walls when we pulled down the old wallpaper.

After a few months we wanted to get rid of the piano and we posted it on Craigslist. It took three hours and four hearty men to haul this huge thing out of the house and into the yard. We redid the basement and I put my office down there and the 3am parties seemed to stop.

Then, one afternoon, I was in my basement office and the dog started barking. For a second I felt the same feeling of ""something else"" being in the room and then it was gone. Clearly she was ready to go now that the piano was gone and made a last pass before going. 

EDIT - Here is a gallery of photos from the house: [Image Gallery (note the old wallpaper and handsome varnished doors. Wallpaper sucked but the doors were beautiful.

20,how the hell can my parents be so fucking nonchalant about seeing a ghost??,1299460340,"I suppose I should type out the whole backstory...

My mom and dad; two very skeptical people.  Ever since my sister and I were kids my mom and dad used to sort of offhandedly comment about ""the ghost"" that supposedly lived in the house I was born in.  I finally asked them to tell me what they really saw.  They are divorced, so I was asking them at two separate times, and neither had talked to the other for years, so they were definitely not trolling.

they both claim that several times, they had seen a woman wearing a white nightgown on the second floor of the house.  my dad's story is that one time he got out of bed to go to the bathroom, which involved walking down the hallway from the master bedroom towards the back of the house.  typical rowhome layout.  he said he heard creaking on the bedsprings in the back bedroom, so he looked in and saw my mom sitting on the bed.  he mumbled something to her and went back to their bedroom and climbed into bed.  AND MY MOM WAS THERE FUCKING SLEEPING. that is to say, A DAMN GHOST WOMAN SITTING ON THE BED IN THE ROOM THAT I WOULD EVENTUALLY SLEEP IN. 

my mom's story is even more surreal.  she says that various weird things would happen, like they would hear the faucet start running in the bathroom, and go in and turn it off...then it would be running again...  typical stuff that I suppose you can rationalize to be leaky plumbing or something.  random bedsprings creaking in the back bedroom where my dad saw the woman sitting on the bed.  

on to what she saw.  she said that one night, she was climbing the stairs to the second floor, looking down at her feet as she climbed.  as she got to the top, almost in the blink of an eye, she looked up into the dark doorway of the middle bedroom, and saw a woman, wearing 19th Century clothing (a white dress, I believe she said) reach out toward her from the doorway, and then promptly vanish.  my mother says she saw her face, and that she wasn't afraid (more startled than anything) as she claims to have gotten the feeling that the woman was ""saying goodbye"".  neither her or my dad saw anything after that.

both of them are very skeptical.  they have no reason to be lying to me or trolling.  i said to them, ""do you realize that if what you are saying is true...that you have seen these things with your own eyes, it confirms for you that the spiritual world exists??? do you realize how huge this is?  how i can never fully believe you but you have to believe your own eyes?""  

I mean, shit.  If I had seen something like that...a bona fide GHOST--not just a ""bright light"" out of the corner of my eye or some creaking floorboards or something that can be attributed to a dream...i'd be a little more serious about the implications.

I guess I can never fully believe them unless I see something that convincing with my own eyes.  I guess that's all any of us can say when it comes to any of this stuff.",nosleep,edharken,/r/nosleep/comments/fyoxn/how_the_hell_can_my_parents_be_so_fucking/

Every account is the same; I would awaken from my slumber in the middle of the night (one time during the day,) and I would feel another presence in the room with me.  I felt like I was being watched, and I felt that the other THING with me was not of good intentions.  And just like every experience, I find myself either a. paralyzed with fear or being physically held down.  In either case, I always struggle for freedom despite my fear and in both cases I am never immediately successful.  When I do break free, I find myself with an elevated heart rate and the feeling that I'm still being watched, but the presence is helpless.  It got to a point in my life where this would happen so often, that i had to make sure to not sleep on my back.  Occasionally I find myself drifting to sleep on my back and I have to make sure to adjust my position, otherwise she'll come.  Ever since I change my sleep position, she hasn't returned, but when I do...

25,I watched my suitemate go crazy,1299454984,"First off this is a true story, so it might not have a ""good"" ending and I made up some generic names. I'm currently a Junior in college, but when I was a freshman I lived with seven random guys in a dorm suite. Three of them were friends before we all moved in, and I lived with one of them named ""Steve"" while his friend ""Joe"" lived next to us. Joe was a pretty normal guy the first quarter, he sold some pot to make a little cash, and just sort of hung out. I was never to close to him, so I didn't notice his ""break"", but i'm told he started to change at the end of the first quarter, that the stress of the quarter made him lose it. I first started noticing little things, he would come into our room, ask my roommate (his old friend) strange questions about business he wanted to form. Steve would answer his questions, but Joe would just stay in our room for a couple hours, saying nothing while we studied, just sitting in our room. 

It was around this time that someone caught me up with what was going on, that Joe had been getting weird, in fact he had called his parents and told them he didn't want to speak to them for a year, at this point he had also more or less failed out. He spent his days calling banks, trying to get loans to start insane businesses. The next few events happened in relative quick succession, so I'm not sure this is the exact order. Basically Joe started doing weirder and weirder things. He started smoking plants he would find around school, and stealing other peoples things. His parent came up to try to speak to him, but he just sat there in silence until they left. One night he got drunk, and was laying in our shared bathroom, hugging the (gross) toilet and screaming ""I want a cock to suck, give me a fucking cock!"" We managed to him to his room, where he kept trying to throw up under the bed before finally passing out. Another one of our suitemates went into the bathroom one night at around four AM to pee, and when he turned on the light Joe was just standing there, in the dark staring at the mirror. Another roommate had a similar experience but Joe was naked in the bathroom when he went in at four AM. 

At this point we were all discussing if we needed to do anything about him, if he was dangerous. We never finished the discussion because one day we went into the bathroom, and Joe was in there with a knife, and he had cut his hands up real bad. We got the knife from him, called the RA's to talk to him, and we hoped this was a turning point. I discovered that wasn't the case because when I came home the next day he was just standing in his room naked with the door open, so everyone walking by could see. It was that point I said fuck it, started locking our doors while I slept, and just avoided him. The school year ended, and I only saw him once at summer school for a second, and he seemed better. I hope this story wasn't boring, it's true, so it doesn't end with murder or disappearance, just a bunch of scared people giving up. Thanks for taking the time to read this, hope this was a worthy story of nosleep.

My Uncle is one of the most down-to-earth kind of people I know.  He took philosophy in University, he worked as a funeral director/embalmer for years and recently became a Catholic priest (about 10 years ago, maybe not that recent.)  Anyway, occasionally he shares stories with me.  One of which was a house blessing he went to (which is basically an exorcism for a house,) and that scared the shit out of me.  Now once again, I must stress he is the most down-to-earth kind of person I've ever met, so you can see why I would find it not only scary, but TERRIFYING when he told me, in complete seriousness, ""never use a Ouija Board.""
This man had worked/lived at a funeral home for years and claims to never experience anything scary.  When I asked him ""Why?"" his response was simple:  ""You may not be communicating with who you think you're communicating with.""  I think I butchered that quote, but the point came across well, the point being, you may think you're talking with a dead relative, when really it's a rouse.  Another point he made was that it attracts the attention of others.

30,Best friends forever.,1299449488,"I'm a child of the '80s. When I was 7, I got a Cricket Doll for my birthday. If you're not familiar, Cricket is an animated doll that looked around and talked, with moving eyes and mouth, and a cassette player in the back to make her sing and talk. While I slept I would have her next to me, with a little pillow and blanket of her own. Why I did this, I don't know, but I think that new plastic smell was sort of comforting. 

One night, I woke up to this whirring noise. It was coming from Cricket, and her eyes were just roaming back and forth, back and forth. Then she started talking in this low, slow voice, saying ""You and me. Best friends forever."" Whenever she would say it, her eyes would stop and stare straight at me, but when she stopped talking, her eyes would resume their roaming, all the while making that whirrr sound. Then she said it once more, eyes looking at me, but this time she just whispered it. ""Best friends forever.""

I grabbed her and threw her across the room. She hit the far wall and started giggling. All the while the whirring got more frenzied as if her eyes were trying to process what had happened. Then, as I lay under the covers, wishing for it to all stop, she started whispering again, but it was so low and slow I couldn't figure out what she was saying. Until she said, ""Talk to you later"". Then all sounds stopped. 

The next day I told my parents what happened and they laughed it off, telling me that her batteries were just dying out. I told them I didn't want her anymore. They must have thrown her out or given her to someone else because I never saw her again. 

I would look her up on the web and put a link but I don't even want to see it.

31,Nimble-fingered devils?,1299449257,"	This past Thanksgiving, I met up with all of my mom’s side of the family. I have several cousins that I rarely see (every 5-6 years), and have pretty much lost touch with apart from the occasional Christmas card or update from my mom. That being said, I learned a lot about that side of my family during this trip -- a lot that my parents had decided not to tell me growing up. Definitely some of the creepiest shit that I’ve ever heard.
	The one that stuck with me the deepest happened to my cousin about a year ago. She’s about 25 at the time, living with a girl that she’s been close friends with for a long time, someone she went to school with. I say that to emphasize the fact that this is a girl my cousin knew well and trusted, and not someone who would make things up for attention.
	As my cousin tells it, a few little things started happening semi-regularly. The first she remembers is a heavy, heavy smell of cigarette smoke sort of wafting by the couch in the middle of the living room. This happened several times, even though neither of them smoked inside the house. Weird, but not really that big of a deal.
	The next part she described was a little less subtle. My cousin’s home alone in the house, just out of the shower. She walks from her bathroom down the hall to her roommate’s to use her blowdryer, but before she plugs it in she hears the faucet running in the bathroom she just came from. She doesn’t remember leaving it on, so she goes back to turn it off, and ALL of her stuff has been thrown all over the place. The cabinets and drawers are open, and everything that was on the sink is all knocked over and strewn about the floor. Like someone just came in and swept it all off with their hands. This freaked her out quite a bit. 
	There’s quite a few other things that happened in between that and this next one, but this is the one I really wanted to mention -- I haven’t been able to get it out of my mind. A few weeks after the bathroom deal, my cousin comes home to find her roommate sitting on the couch in the living room, arms folded, with a piece of paper sitting on the coffee table in front of her. Her roommate is just seething with anger, points to the sheet of paper, and asks, “Why would you do this?” My cousin has no idea what she’s asking, so she walks over and picks up the sheet of paper.
	Turns out her roommate walked into her room and found that sheet of paper laying face down on her desk. The whole page is typed, neatly, and at the top is a creepy verse from Revelation. I don’t remember it specifically, but something about demons. Then there’s a list of about thirty different names of demons and devils, some fairly common -- Beelzebub, Mephistopheles, Lucifer -- but mostly super obscure, stuff that she had never seen before. At the bottom, there was printed a small picture of a devil, right next to a small picture of an angel.
	What’s extra creepy about this is that the page was printed on the roommate’s unique letterhead. This paper wasn’t even in the printer, but locked in her roommate’s desk drawer. In order for someone to do this, they would have had to find a way to unlock that drawer, put the letterhead into her printer, then make a document on her computer and print it out. 
	So, upon hearing this, I’ve narrowed it down to one of two possibilities: 1) psycho roommate or 2) holy shit, I have no idea. I know my cousin wouldn’t make this up for the hell of it, and she seems convinced that her roommate wouldn’t either. All I know is that it weirded me the hell out.

UPDATE: MY ENCOUNTER IN THE HOUSE

After my first update I went into the house with my summoning reagents in hand. Upon reaching the steps something felt completely unnatural and insane like I had just passed into “The Twilight Zone”, being an extreme skeptic I passed It off as my mind playing tricks. A furry critter existed underneath the boards because I heard rustling and squeaking when I began my ascent up the steps toward the entrance. Something occurred to me; the house must be infested with varmints. The door was unlocked but was on two loose hinges so it took significant force to open it for my body to fit through.  

I entered and I felt brushing fur against my legs and I was horrified; I nearly dropped my reagents for summoning the spirit. You must understand that when you enter a dank wretched house and something brushes against your leg it is fucking horrifying especially with the fact that you are defenseless to the whatever horror is lurking among the shadows.  It was  pitch dark and terrifying in the entrance area so I immediately lit my small candle and looked down to see a an uncountable number of rats. I screamed but I kept my wits and scared off the rats by stomping on the ground around me. The rats almost made me turn and run out of that house. If I was scared of rats how could I challenge the Midnight Man; I needed to grow some balls and press forward. I set up the reagents on the door while looking behind me for anything wishing to harm me.

The house was very familiar to me. I first took steps into the den because I curious to see what was left behind. From what was visible I could see everything intact  with its own décor of dust and feces. Vintage chairs and even a grand piano were still where it was left. Interested in the piano I went over bent with the intention of playing Moonlight Sonata but not without chirping and squealing coming from inside the piano at the first note; I backed away in shock and continued on my journey throughout the house.  

When I reached the kitchen I felt a coldness swiftly come over me. I was decked out in arctic garb and yet it felt immeasurably cold, a cold I could only describe as shrill, chilling, and completely unnatural. I don’t know if the coldness was my mind playing tricks but it felt completely real. 

I didn’t dare to look in the pantry; I had enough of rats to last a life time. The smell in the kitchen was unbearable; I held my hand to my nose the whole time. I felt fortunate that there were open vents in the form of broken windows throughout the kitchen for if there was no moving air the smell would be enough to knock any human out. Continuously I felt watched, and I feared it wasn’t only the rats. 

What really freaked me out about the kitchen was on the island among the plates and silverware was a dish and not only a dish but the dish my grandfather used to greet me with cookies, I knew this because it had vibrant colors and little animals on it. It felt as if I was visiting the house as child and my grandfather was expecting me.
The wind howled and screamed throughout the kitchen as I described it, like harpies. I was sick of the putrid kitchen so I exited to a hallway which I remembered led to be my grandfather’s room. I felt around the sides of the hallway and steadily made my way down to my homely grandfather’s room. 

Suddenly it became cold; colder than ice firmly clenched in your fist. I felt naked in an arctic wasteland and completely unprotected and vulnerable. In an instant something appeared in the doorway completely human and yet inhuman but it soon went out of vision so I dismissed it as just a simple illusion. I continued to walk and reached the doorway in an instant I looked at the bed. In shock I saw what I feared the most and ran for my life. 

What I saw on 3/6/11 in the bed was the manifestation of dismal evil it seemed malicious and eager to beat me at his “game”. I saw on the bed a shadowy humanly  figure staring at me with the ungodly empty eyes of my worst nightmare. The figure seemed to be lying down and remained there just staring with unblinking eyes. In shock I acted foolishly; dropped my candle and ran for my life. I can only describe the face I saw with this picture http://i.imgur.com/SMgxN.jpg just a staring apparition. I am shivering as I type this because I do not know if what I saw was a figment of my imagination, I hope it was. The heat emitted from my body was helped counter the temperature which now felt like absolute zero. 

Acting like a madman I swiftly groped the sides of the walls covered in cakes of dust and wet splotches which led my way up the creaking grand stairs to my old childhood room where I felt most protected and spread salt around myself to ward off whatever I saw. Without light the only thing I could depend on was table salt . I dared not move in the pitch darkness and I stayed there for the duration of my time in the house. My eyes adjusted the darkness and  the paintings of cartoon animals on the walls were perverted in my eyes to seem demented. In my state of mind everything seemed to be obscured in some way. I could picture “The Midnight Man” standing in the corner of my own childhood room staring with beady eyes and just waiting for me to leave the safety on my circle so he can overcome me. Of course I couldn’t see it because of the darkness but I could just feel his presence. 

I sat in my huddled makeshift defense backed against a wall for the rest of my stay and at 3:33 I booked out like any sane person would and drove to whatever I could call safe. 

From this experience I can honestly preach to never try this especially at a house which would fuck you up on a normal night. Whatever happened in that house was possibly my mind’s doing but my memories are so vivid; I have no idea what to think of it. I theoretically passed “The Midnight Man’s” test even with a direct encounter with what I think was him. I just wish I didn’t run out of my parent’s room when I saw him, I guess I overestimated my fear factor. I feel proud of myself for doing it and  it will be a good story to tell friends. I can only describe my experience like being stuck in the middle of a Lovecraftian fiction.

If any of you ever attempt this I warn you to never play it in an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere.

43,The Dream.,1299380890,"When i was in HS i had a friend who would always try to get me to read spiritual book and a few times i did. He talked me into reading one book that dreams and how they were real life, so one day i decided that was was going to meet him for lunch to give the book back. I finished my normal day of things and found him sitting under a tree reading a book. As i handed him back the book he asked me what i thought about it. My reply was its really cool but i don't believe in it. He reply was he could prove it and insisted on showing me. He stood up and started shaking me excessively, so hard that it felt like my back was breaking and just before i was going to scream stop... I woke up.
I was shaken by this and in my head i knew i needed to get this book back to him today. My day pretty much ran exactly as the dream did and where did i find him, under the same F-ing tree. My heart sank in my chest as i started walking closer to him and when i was like 4 feet away he look up at me and said ""do you believe me now."" My knee's almost closed in on their selves, almost fainting but i managed to say ""aaaahhh what?""

45,The Weed Demon,1299375180,"New Zealand has these great chain of stores called 'Cosmic Corner', which sell herbal drugs, party pills, bongs, hookahs, apparel and other miscellaneous junk that appeals to stoners and teenagers. Being proper shops that pay tax, they're always strictly above the law, however.

One day, some acquaintances and I managed to find the one store that was the exception to this rule, and were surprised and delighted when the dreadlocked, tanned assistant sold us a little baggie with a wink and a grin. The city we live in is blessedly low on violent crimes, and accordingly the visible police presence is low enough that we felt safe enough to bust out a small pipe in the alley outside the shop. We took a quick celebratory blaze through a couple of buds before starting our walk home across town.

We'd been walking for about 5 minutes, and things were just starting to swing nicely as we got to the park. There were a group of guys playing soccer who motioned for us to join in. Soccer seemed like it would be a great lark, so we happily acquiesced.

As we were playing, a few more people joined in, and the field began to get a little busier. Anyone who has played soccer when there are a lot of people in the game will know that after a certain number of people are playing, the game grinds to a halt as the ball is essentially still in the middle of a large mob of people frantically kicking it. Despite this, more people still seemed to be joining the game, and the kicks aimed at the ball seemed to get more and more frantic. The mob began to feel much too close, and that awful feeling of being trapped in a large crowd became powerful. 

The kicks got ever more frantic, violent. I had lost sight of the others, and couldn't move for all the writhing bodies. The kicks had begun to hurt and the crushing bodies caused me to wheeze and stutter for air, and it became hard to concentrate. I fought against my panic and tried to clear my mind to find a way out and noticed that the air had turned sinister - like rounding a corner in a tourist city in a poor country, and suddenly finding yourself off the beaten path, and the subject of sullen stares and whispered pointing. Something wasn't right, I could hear a faint ringing sound and realised the sound had been in my ears for a long time without me consciously hearing it. 

I focused on the sound, making it concious, concentrating... and the game vanished. My friends and I were lying scattered on the field. Covered in bruises, the others still writhed and kicked. I shouted, this broke the atmosphere, the others stopped fighting, came to, and looked blearily around the deserted park.

That feeling you get when you're really tired, where if you really force yourself you can stay awake, continue to function, but before you know it you're drifting off to sleep. The way that in dreams, no situation seems suspicious, until you notice a ringing sound that seems to always have been there, and the illusion falls apart. The way reality can bend but you never notice the obvious seams of the world. These things conspired to violence that day.

Shaken and terrified, we continued the walk home. Trying our best to concentrate, to stay lucid. Whatever it was in that thick, white smoke we had inhaled continued its sinister work. Situations would subtly skew, turn sideways and lead us toward danger in alleys, on bridges, in front of cars.

There are so many places in a city that can be suddenly dangerous. 

Two pretty girls motion you into an alley, you smile and turn, rub your ears to clear the ringing sound. There areno girls, only the sound of friends behind calling you back, and a dark alley ahead.

Japanese tourists drop their wallet into a small stream, they're so kindly and worried that you are compelled to retrieve it for them. The piled earth of the stopbank shifts, slides and crumbles. The roaring of the water forcing through the iron grille to the treatment plant almost masks a strange ringing sound.

A dog wags its tail and grins. Your hand reaches out to pat him, but snaps back just in time. The dog is backed against the brick wall, teeth bared and snarling.

If you've ever realised you're dreaming, then you will know that glorious and profound shock, the way it will snap you into a relieved awakening even as you desperately clutch the receding dream. It was as such that I awakened from my dream about the 'weed demon'. The dark anti-conciousness that lives coiled within only the whitest smoke.

---

That is the exact dream I had after watching 'The Butterfly Effect' and 'Inception' back-to-back and going to bed at 3am.

46,Creepy Haunted House,1299374802,"Me and my friend were going for a run and we were running through this orange grove when we came to a clearing and there was this abandoned house. There was a small house made out of brick and a longer building that looked like a boarding house. All of the doors in the boarding house were busted in except for the last door which had an angel painted on it, and when we opened the door the entire room was black because it had been set on fire but none of the conjoining rooms had any fire damage. Then we went over to the brick house and inside it looked like who ever lived there had just got up and left cause the dishes had been left on the table and there was dishes in the sink. The house had been pretty much trashed and all the doors busted in except for one door and when we opened it the room was painted  pink and completely  covering the walls were little kid crayon drawings and the floor was covered with the drawing about six inches deep. so we were like what the fuck is this!!! and then we did what anyone would do and went through the mailbox which was crammed packed with mail, then we heard a stick snap behind us and when we looked we saw something running through the orange grove so we started running through this water melon patch, when we saw that no one was chasing us we stopped running and right where we had stopped there was a huge ass knife, like Jason status, stabbed in a tree stump. So we decided that this was a place we wanted to show our friends so a week later we run out there with my friends girlfriend and two of our buddies and when we got there, the house was straight up gone.... like no bulldozer tracks or anything... just gone and there were weeds growing in the place where the house had been.

50,"I don't think about this much, but the ""creepy"" thread from /r/AskReddit made me, and I thought you guys would appreciate my story... Living with a Psycho",1299367953,"When I was a sophomore in high school, my mom began dating this guy who looked like Dan Marino. They eventually moved in together, and I had my own bedroom in his house.

This was when I was around 15, so of course, I knew everything and my mom was stupid. We argued constantly, and this was probably the point in my life where we had the worst relationship with each other.

I liked him. He was nice to me, he didn't tell on me when he caught me smoking (one of his) cigarettes, he let me shut the door when my boyfriend was over, and even brought us cokes and snacks and stuff.

The only weird thing that happened when I was there was the one time I came home from school and found him asleep on the couch, with the biggest bong I've ever seen and a tray covered in giant buds that, from my trained eye, looked like some dank chronic.

I thought it was funny until I walked over to get a closer look and found, next to him on the couch, a box literally filled with drivers licenses. I only had ten seconds or so to observe this, but I swear every single one had a picture of a young, pretty girl on it. I was already creeped out, so when he suddenly said ""Hey, what are you looking at?"" right in my left ear, I jumped a mile.

I laughed nervously and said ""oh, nothing"". He laughed, too, and said that he used to own a bar and he just found a box of the old licenses he had that were fake ID's confiscated from teenagers. I laughed and went along with it, not even mentioning the bong or the weed, and went to my room.

I thought he was a nice guy, so after about six months or so, when my mom approached me looking crazed and telling me to pack my shit, we were leaving now, I was totally shocked. I packed a small bag, as did she, and my uncle, her brother, pulled up and we peeled out of there.

For a couple of weeks after that, I kept noticing this tall white guy in a cowboy hat who seemed to be... watching me sometimes. I'd see him in the parking lot of my school, during lacrosse and JROTC practice, at my friend's swim meets. It gave me goosebumps, but I kept telling myself I was being paranoid and brushed it off.

Whenever I asked her why we left, she would just get quiet and say, ""Please, don't ask me that anymore honey, we just had to go.""

So jump forward ten years, I'm 26 and hanging out with my mom at the beach, and we had just taken shots of tequila and were drinking beer together, which is something we never do but hey, we were on vacation. We begin talking about Milton (her old boyfriend). I finally had enough liquid courage in me to ask her, what the fuck?

She told me the freakiest shit I ever heard in my life.

She said that soon after she started dating, he began to assert his dominance over her. He would tell her stories of how he and his friends would go to other guys houses who they suspected cheated at a poker game, or tried to hustle them at billiards, and beat him to within an inch of their lives, just on principle. He made it clear that he had ""people"" just a phone call away.

He began to drug her with stuff that turned her into a careless zombie. Of course, being a self centered, bratty teenager, I didn't see any of this going on. I just knew that she was ""moody"", and sometimes Milton would ask me, in privacy, if I thought that something was ""wrong"" with my mom, like, mentally, putting the idea in my head that she was a little unstable. He was basically pitting us against each other.

She said he used to smoke pot and crack, and would hit her with a belt at least once a day just so she wouldn't feel ""spoiled."" She mentioned the box of drivers licenses, and confirmed my suspicions that they were all young, pretty girls, and he never told her why he had them, but beat her severely when she asked him about them. She said he always hit her on the trunk of her body, never anywhere where people would see marks.

She told me that he made it clear that if she left him, or tried anything, called the cops, whatever, he would poison me with so much LSD that I would be in a nuthouse for the rest of my life (which made me think back to all the times he brought me and my boyfriend sodas and snacks, probably to make her worry).

She told me that for years after we left there, he would call her and her parents, my grandparents, and leave threatening voice messages. But they were never him, they were always like, clips from TV shows and movies.

She told me about the time he took her to breakfast at a local restaurant, two cops came in and sat down at the booth across from them. She said that his mood instantly darkened, and he grabbed her hand under the table, looked her directly in the eye, and said ""We are going to leave, and you are going to kiss me and laugh, and don't look at the cops. We are going to do this right now, and if you don't kiss me and laugh, I will make sure that my partner will make you wish you did. He's a white guy, and he's always got his cowboy hat on.""

So she said that she did what he told her to do. They went home and he never spoke of it again. But, she said, for weeks after that, every once in a while, a white guy in a big old cowboy hat would come in to the restaurant that she managed. He would sit at the bar, not order anything, and just hang out for a bit. She said that she was scared shitless, but she was also drugged up and couldn't tell if she was being paranoid or going crazy, or what.

I told her about the guy I kept seeing in the cowboy hat after we fled from his home, and her face wrinkled and she began to cry. We hugged, and cried together. I apologized for being such a shitty teenager and being on his side the whole time, and she apologized for putting me and herself in harms way for so long (we lived with the guy for about 6 months, I think).

Basically, this man brainwashed my mom and me, made everyone in her life suspect she was unstable mentally, and kept her in his prison of a home under constant threat of harm to herself, and me. He had people stalk us, and left crazy messages on our machine for years later.

To this day, I live in constant fear of that bastard.",nosleep,ViolentBabyDoll,/r/nosleep/comments/fy4sp/i_dont_think_about_this_much_but_the_creepy/
51,A Nasty Habit,1299366365,"Mary had always had a problem biting her fingernails. It's a fairly common habit, but the extent to which she gnawed them down worried her parents. She was only nine - her classmates didn't seem to give it a second thought when asked about it, but nevertheless they decided dealing with the problem now would be easier than letting it continue on through middle school.

You can buy a liquid formula at almost any department store to be applied to your fingernails. They come in many different brands, but they all have the same nasty, bitter taste - repulsive enough to shock the most devoted nailbiter from bringing his fingers anywhere close to his lips. So every night before she went to sleep, her parents would paint the substance on her nails and she never questioned it. They were convinced she did the bulk of her nailbiting after the lights went out.

It worked. Her nails grew back just fine and the torn skin healed itself over even quicker. But they started noticing faint bite marks on other parts of her upper forearm and kneecaps. As the marks bore deeper, they started worrying whether or not she was suffering from some sort of anxiety disorder. This was not the case - three different therapists assured them that their daughter was mentally healthy in every regard. The bite marks, however, did not cease.

One night, as her father was applying the substance, Mary finally asked what it did.

""Well, I suppose there's no harm in telling at this point,"" her father replied. ""Over the past month we've been trying to get you to stop biting your nails. This liquid has been making them taste very bad.""

""Huh?"" She puzzlingly lifted her fingers to her lips and licked them a few times. ""Tastes just fine to me.""",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fy4g4/a_nasty_habit/

60,Happenings at 1205 Riverside Dr,1299306797,"It was getting into the later hours, around 10 o'clock, and I was sitting in front of the dull glow of my computer monitor. It still amazes me how much time one can waste watching videos of kittens on youtube. My roommate was out, so I, being bored, decided to do some chores. Clean my room, do the laundry, wash my sheets, and all the other random tasks that one decides are necessary after a month of putting them off. It took around 5 minutes to do everything besides the laundry. The sheets were done, so the only thing I needed for my bed was the comforter, which moments ago was advanced to the dryer. So I plunked back into my chair and resumed a video of Dick Proenneke building a log cabin for him to live in. After a bit I realized that my comforter should be dry, retrieved it, advanced another load, and slung the warm mass over my bed where I then sat and continued my video. The video ended, and it was then that I realized the rain outside. It was softly slapping the sides of my window, and other noises were present too. The dryer churned off in the distance, and a creak from someone walking on the second floor. 

Then I heard something strange... 

From the living room I heard a -tingting-. Like the sound of someone tapping a glass with their fork. -tingting- There is goes again. I continued to lay in my bed, staring intently at my open door. Beyond the door was nothing but darkness as I had turned off all the lights except for the one in my room. I felt nervous, and I did not want to leave my room and find the source of the noise. The nearest light switch was down the hall, and I was scared.. -tingting- I stood up, walked to the door, and closed it. There, problem solved, I shouldn't be able to hear it now, and it's probably just some weird sound caused by the rattling of the dryer. Then I simply forgot about it, and continued to lay on my bed. I was trimming my nails and tossing them behind my bed because.. what the hell are you supposed to do with nail clippings? I noticed that my monitor had dimmed and shut off. Then I heard another sound..

-wehh wehh wehh wehh wehh wehh-

It was my roommate's alarm clock, wailing like alarm clocks do, and doing another number on my nerves. -wehh wehh wehh wehh wehh wehh- I had to turn it off or the thing would drive me insane, so I stood up, walked over to my door, and hesitated. As I looked at the door knob it seemed to grow, like I was zooming in with a video-camera or something. My heart began to make itself noticed -lubdub..lubdub- and had a conflicting tempo to the -wehh wehh- in the background. The noise was unbearable, so in a moment of bravery I grabbed the knob and slung open the door.

There, the darkness was waiting for me..

-lubdub..lubdub- I felt a chill run over me as I gazed into that dark hole of a hallway. The alarm was down the hall to the right, opposite of the living room, speaking of living rooms.. -tingting- My hair stood on end. Fear overtook me and I slammed the door shut, turned around, walked to my bed, and continued to sit there. I decided to stare at the blackness of my monitor, and try and forget these sounds, pretend they didn't exist. 

It seemed to be working. I was becoming calm again, and all I had to do was focus on the screen across the room. Then I heard another creak, as if from upstairs, but it was below me. Beneath me. I began to panic, but my gaze did not falter, this too shall pass. Then a scraping, as if something was being dragged across my wooden floors, under my bed.

Then, I heard the voice of a child ""Mm, a little treat."" 

-wehh wehh wehh wehh wehh- -tingting- -lubdub..lubdub- All of this was too overwhelming, I must be imagining things, but I continued that stare. I hadn't noticed my reflection on that screen until that very moment, and then I noticed something else. Behind me, from the space between my bed and the wall, was a figure rising, it looked as if they were floating up. Is that a little girl? And what is she holding? She didn't move, and I chalked it up to be a hallucination. No, it can't be.. she isn't there. 

Those dark, empty eyes stared right into mine, and a little smile crossed her face.

I could feel her breathing down my neck.

I turned around to confront this thing that had sprouted from my mind. But it was no hallucination. -lubdub- She was holding a handful of nail clippings, slipped one in her mouth, and began to chew. -lubdub-

63,Don't ever turn it off... never.,1299295185,"I haven't spoken about this before now and I fear that I have lost much of my sanity as a result. The years of endless inquisition have not been kind to me as well as the constant yearning of my heart for the same answers that they were seeking. 
 
Back in 2000 my family and I moved up to Indianapolis, Indiana. I am a software programmer and had moved up there for work. It was at the end of the dot com bubble and I thought I was pretty lucky to find a good paying gig for someone that was self taught and had only 3 years of actual on the job programming experience. My wife and I had only been married for three years and had just received our second child less than a year before the move. I decided it would be best for me to move up and find us a place to live by myself first and then send for them. 
 
I moved into a one bedroom apartment in Riley Towers. I thought it was funny that I had moved from Alabama and was now living on Alabama Street in the middle of downtown Indianapolis. My apartment was a very cozy apartment on the 13th floor in one of the smaller sections of the apartment complex. There were two large towers and connected to one of them was a much wider complex that wasn't as tall. I lived in there. For the most part, things were very beautiful. But beauty isn't the thing that I remember the most. 
 
There were no washer/dryer connections in the apartment, but there was a very large laundry mat in the basement of the towers. The basement also was used as extra storage for the residents. When you exited the elevators you would get an instant chill up your spine that something wasn't right here. I tried to get my laundry done as quickly as possible but having never lived in a big city before, I was nervous to leave my clothes in the machines and leave to go back upstairs; so I would sit and wait. 
 
The room where the laundry machines was fairly large and at the end of the long room was an opening to the storage. There was no door, just a large hole big enough for a set of double doors. It was very dark and very menacing looking. I knew when my wife and children arrived in a few months that we would most likely just move into one of the larger apartments and we would need one of these storage rooms so I decided to walk into the room one day to check them out. It was a large room that had a warehouse feeling to it. The ground was a solid cement base and the storage areas were large cages made out of fence like materials, only heavier and not as easy to break into. With the clanking of the machines in the other room, the dim lighting, and all the possessions it reminded me of a scene out of ""Hellraiser"", but without the blood. 
 
Walking through the area, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I felt something brush against me from behind. I turned around to see a water pipe running up through the middle of the floor. It wasn't uncommon and really wasn't out of place, but it wasn't close enough for me to have brushed against it. There was nothing else near, however. I walked closer to the pipe and noticed that it was dripping water from a small spigot sticking out. It wasn't a slow drip, but rather the type of fast dripping that occurs when a child can't turn the water off. I reached for the spigot to turn the water off only to have the chill come up my spine again and heard someone with a real deep voice say, ""Don't turn that off."" 
 
Frightened, I turned around to see what appeared to be an older man clothed in rags. He appeared to be homeless and this struck me as odd considering you had to go through security check points to get into the building. 

""Don't ever turn it off.... never,"" he said in a stern way. His face was wrinkled up, but I don't remember much about him. The shock of being turned around to the sound of someone that wasn't there had me in a state of fear and almost laughing as I replied, ""You almost gave me a heart attack"". I had bent over grabbing my heart in a mocking sort of way. When I looked up the man wasn't there but I heard him walking towards the elevator. I ran to catch him to see what he meant but he was on the elevator and gone before I could catch him. 
 
Three months later, I moved my wife and kids up and we lived in a two bedroom apartment. I told her the story of the old man and how living on the 13th floor had creeped me out (we were now on the fourth floor). She laughed at how silly it all sounded coming from me, someone that isn't superstitious or even believed in any type of ghosts but yet I was still nervous about small, dark places. 
 
One evening she went to wash our clothes. I had given the children a bath and put them to bed while she was busy doing the laundry. After watching some television I began to get nervous that my wife hadn't returned. I waited around a bit longer and when I could no longer hold out I decided to scoop the children up and put them into their stroller so we could go down to the basement and check on their mother.  
 
I will never forget something that I originally passed off as a mistake of mine. When I went to my bedroom to get the stroller, I heard the water on in the kids' bathroom. It wasn't a full stream and it wasn't dripping, it was a very light stream like the kind you would use to fill up a water pistol. Before getting the stroller I turned off the water figuring I hadn't turned the knobs all the way after bathing the kids. 
 
I went down into the basement to see no one in the laundry. The machines were silent but sure enough a few of them contained our clothes. I gazed at the large, empty doorway leading to the storage area. I parked the stroller where I could see the kids and peaked inside of the room. There was no one around, no sounds, dead silence. It was then I noticed the pipe that had scared me previously. I noticed the water was off and near the puddle was a shoe print. Upon closer inspection, it was a small, petite shoe size. 
 
Before I could get any closer, one of my children began to scream a shrill like someone had just hit one of them. I turned to see no one near by and rushed over to see what was the matter. Still no one, but my daughter was reaching into the air and screaming louder than I had ever heard before. I rushed the stroller back to the elevator and hurried over to the concierge desk and tried to explain what had happened. 
 
No video from the security cameras showed anyone entering or leaving the building during the time I had been waiting with the exception of a few people coming home late from work. The police were called. 
 
I had no family and had not made any friends yet and so I had no one to watch the children and go out to look for her. The police and the concierge promised they were going to scour the apartment complex and find her. There were no other ways out of the apartment complex that weren't visible on the security cameras and they felt confident she was still in the building. 
 
Somehow I managed to return to my apartment with my children. My hands shook as I opened my door not knowing how I would sleep that night without my wife being found. I closed the door and turned to take my children to their beds when I heard it again. The sound of the bath water running ever so gently and the low wailing moans of a young lady being tortured. 
 
My wife was never found. My children had to go and live with her sister. For 11 years I have not been able to sleep in a bedroom near a bathroom, because every night around 11pm the water turns on and the low moaning sounds commence. You can try to ignore the sounds, but you can't ignore the figure of your once beautiful wife standing at the foot of your bed soaked in water and blood with her face hanging from her skull.

64,The Pursuer,1299294839,"The student fled across the dorm courtyard, sincerely hoping the power outage meant that the magnetic doors wouldn’t work. The shrieks of his pursuers edged him on as he scurried for the entrance to the dorm building. He didn’t slow down on approach – he would burst through the door, or die trying. He shifted his weight forward, and exposed his right shoulder as he braced for impact.

*Smash*

He burst into the hallway and swung himself round on the stair banister. He felt another surge of adrenaline rush as he saw a grey figure rush past him in the hallway, parallel to the stairs. The feral sounds of the mass chasing him ripped raw fear in the student, desperate to return to the safety of the flat on the top floor. He dashed along the next hallway in the zig zagging stairwell, dreading each pass as he barely saw his pursuer, clearly catching up on him. The student swung for the last time before the animal grabbed him and smashed his head against the wall. The hunter’s aura changed, calmed. He lifted the now skull fractured, floppy student and slowly walked up the last set of stairs. He threw the student through the window into the blood-thirsty mob below.",nosleep,rascal999,/r/nosleep/comments/fxp5a/the_pursuer/

66,The Website,1299279300,"This all happened in 1997, and even though it was that long ago, it still sticks with me as the scariest, most inexplicably bizarre thing that has ever happened to me. It all has to do with a website my friend found while using my computer one day. This website somehow changed him....

First I need to tell you a bit about this friend. His name was Malcolm and he was the embodiment of every nerd, geek, dork stereotype there is. He was skinny, pale, had bad complexion, perfectly parted hair, thick glasses, and bad teeth. He was into computers and anime and seemed to know everything there was to know about both subjects. He was very meek and introverted.

To this day I have no idea why he and I got along so well. We were not alike at all. I was fairly athletic, and usually went out of my way to be crass and offensive while he avoided anything physical beyond inserting memory sticks into computers, and he went out of his way to be as unoffensive as possible. To avoid swearing he would say things like ""This is nucking futs"" instead of ""This is fucking nuts"" or ""When the defecation hits the oscillation"" instead of ""When the shit hits the fan."" It drove me bonkers when he spoke like that but the worst was whenever you called his name, he would reply ""That's my name, don't wear it out."" I mean really, who talks like that?

Anyway, one day Malcolm was at my house helping me setup a 56k modem on my computer. Back in 1997 this was about as fast as you could get without breaking the bank. I was pretty stoked, even back then the internet was pretty sweet. I spent a lot of time in mIRC chat rooms trolling and trying to pick up chicks. As I recall I think it was Malcolm who got me into computers/internet/mIRC in the first place. I had graduated highschool in 96 and been a jock up until that point, knowing little to nothing of computers.

After he set everything up for me he began pulling up different sites to show me how much faster it was than my old dial up modem. I remember not being that impressed, if there was a difference in loading times it was pretty negligible, but Malcolm insisted pictures were loading atleast twice as fast as before. 

I knew Malcolm was planning on heading home after he finished getting this modem installed and I was planning on sitting on mIRC and drinking some beers. I went to the kitchen to grab a beer and when I came back to the computer Malcolm was sitting there staring at the computer screen, completely mezmerised. From where I was, I couldn't see the computer screen so I moved in behind him. On the monitor, the screen was flickering bright colors. I remember seeing orange, red and dark green flashing by insanely fast. I only looked at it for a few seconds but it made my eyes water and I immediately felt sick to my stomach. I think if I had watched the screen for another second I would have thrown up. It was intense. I thought for a second that maybe it was one of those stupid banner ads that would pop up from time to time telling you that you were the 100,000th visitor and had won something. Then it dawned on me.

""Malcolm is that one of those stupid anime things you're always talking about? How the fuck can watch that, I just about had a seizure?""

The screen went blank a second later but Malcolm just sat there staring at the monitor, still not responding to my question. I could now see his reflection in the blank monitor screen. He looked catatonic.

""Malcolm?"" I reached out and put my hand on his shoulder. My hand touching his shoulder startled him and he finally turned to face me. He looked me right in the eye and I saw his face change in that instant. His eyes suddenly became menacing and threatening. His mouth curled into a snarl. I would never have imagined in my wildest dreams that Malcolm could make such an intense, evil face. He honestly looked like he wanted to kill me.

That's when he jumped up out of his chair and tackled me to the ground. He had immense strength and speed. On top of me it felt like he weighed as much as 2 or 3 men his size. I remember he held my arms pinned to my sides, his skinny fingers digging into my biceps.

""I WILL FUCK EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU"" He screamed right in my face, every word spraying me with saliva. He snarled and licked his lips, he was literally salivating. His face was bright red and almost glowing, his eyes were completely bloodshot and I could see a vein on his forehead pulsing to the point I thought it would burst. For a moment I thought, or maybe I hoped he would have a heart attack, I thought that might be my only chance to survive this.

Malcolm raised his fist. He held it up trembling. I honestly feared for my life at this point. I thought that with the state he was in if he started hitting me he wasn't going to stop. He'd knock me unconscious and just keep swinging. I started pleading with him.

""Malcolm, stop! Please man."" I begged. ""Malcolm why are you doing this?""

""FUCK YOU IS WHY!"" He screamed, blowing spit all over. His glasses were fogging up and sliding down his sweat drenched nose. He glared at me over the top of the thick frames, his eyes were burning with anger.

""Malcolm man, come on"" I was almost weeping now. ""This is nucking futs.....the defecation is really hitting the oscillation right now....""

Malcolm started laughing, his whole body was trembling.  His fist was still raised and I used my free arm to try and shield the inevitable blows. But the blows never came, and Malcolm's laugh started to die off. Within seconds the laugh was reduced to a wimper. I took my arm away from my face and looked up at him, his fist was no longer clenched and he was using his hand to push up his glasses and wipe the sweat from his face. 

""Malcom?""

He looked down at me sheepishly. I think he understood less about what had just happened than I did. Then he smiled and let out a nervous chuckle.

""That's my name, don't wear it out."" He replied, finally standing up and getting off me.

After that I stayed the hell away from my computer for a while, and didn't see much of Malcolm. It wasn't until a month later that I phoned him up and reluctantly asked him to come hang out with me. I wasn't sure what we were gonna do, Malcolm was only interested in computers and anime and after what happened last time I didn't want anything to do with either of those.

When he came over it was awkward but we managed to have a conversation about baseball, Malcolm and I had been following the Toronto Blue Jays that year. Things had definitely changed between us though, I couldn't think of Malcolm in the same way as I used to and truth be told I don't think Malcolm was quite the same as he used to be. Something was off about him, one thing I noticed about him during that day was he would zone out and get that catatonic look on his face. He would also drool on himself a lot and not even notice it was happening.  As scary as it sounds, I think whatever that website did to Malcolm, it did some irreversible damage.

Weeks later when I finally did get back on the computer I went to my web history and wrote down the url for the website that had fucked Malcolm up. I then wiped my browser history. I had no intention of going to the website ever again but I knew it was something I shouldn't lose. I've long since lost the paper I wrote the url on and can't for the life of me remember what it was. I remember it ended in .edu which was unusual because at the time I was only familiar with websites that ended in .com or .net. I've never been able to find the website again either nor have I come across anyone who has. I think that's probably for the best.",nosleep,KanadianLogik,/r/nosleep/comments/fxkyl/the_website/

68,The Body on Main Street,1299272693,"This happened on a Halloween when I was in high school. I say that so you can understand why some of the people acted the way they did. You know how Halloween gets. All sorts of pranks are pulled, people cover themselves with fake blood, etc. When you see a body lying in the street on Halloween, sure, you're shocked at first. But the shock quickly changes to a variety of different emotions depending on the individual. Some people laugh, some people shake their heads and roll their eyes. My friend Cindy got angry, thinking it was a mean trick to pull.

That's why it was twenty minutes to nine before anybody bothered to take a closer look.

I was handing out candy, too old in my mind to be out in costume, begging for treats like a little kid. Cindy was over because her parents and mine had gone to a party hosted by some mutual friends, and Cindy was too skittish to stay home alone. I'm glad she was with me.

Our town was small, the kind with a single main street that runs straight through it. It was off the highway, not a shortcut to anywhere, and you can walk from one side of the town to the other in less than an hour, so there wasn't any traffic to speak of.

I still don't know where the body came from.

I remember I had just given the last Kit Kat to some kid dressed as Batman, and went inside to refill the bowl. When I came back out, there was a body laying in the street. The Batman kid was staring at it from the sidewalk, and I went down and joined him for a moment before shaking my head and going back up to the porch. Cindy came back from the kitchen with sodas and gave a squeal when she saw it. She nearly dropped the glasses. After she recovered, she yelled at the body in the road.

""Hey, Asshole! You're gonna get run over!""

It just lay there.

Tommy from a block down came by on his bicycle, pedaled a circle around the body, then rode over to us and hopped off. He was wearing a cape and had his hair slicked back. I think he was supposed to be a vampire, but he didn't have any fake fangs in his mouth.

""Who's that in the road?"" he asked us.

""Some asshole,"" Cindy said, loudly, so the person in the road would hear.

""Is he dead?"" Tommy asked. I just shrugged and offered him a Kit Kat. He nodded at me, got back on his bike and circled the body once more. He stopped for a moment, but seemed reluctant to get closer. I think he had the same thought we did... whoever got too close would get the scare of their life when the body jumped up and grabbed them. Instead, he looked over at us, shrugged, and rode off.

""If you don't get up, we're going to call the cops!"" Cindy called out. She stood on the porch for a moment and then started heading inside, saying very loudly, ""That's it, I'm calling the cops!"" I sat down on the porch swing and just watched the body. I was starting to feel a little edgy, like what if the person was really hurt and would we get in trouble for not helping? But every time I started to think I should get up and really check, another kid would show up and say ""trick 'r treat!"" and then make some silly comment about ""the guy in the road"" or the ""fantastic dummy"" we had put out, and my brain would whisper, *He's just waiting for you to go out there and touch him, and then he's going to jump up and yell BOO! and you'll scream bloody murder and he'll laugh and tell everyone at school on Monday.*

Cindy came back out on the porch.

""Alright, buddy! The cops are on their way! They're gonna be pissed that you wasted their time!"" I looked at her anxiously, and she scowled at the body, then looked at me, rolled her eyes and shook her head. No, the police were not coming.

At one point, a car actually did come down the street. Cindy and I sat there, huddled on the porch, nervously waiting to see if the body would get up, if the car would even see it and stop or run it over, or if the driver would get out and check. The car slowed as it got near the body, but instead of stopping, they weaved around it and continued on their way.

Nobody believed it.

Even the grownups who brought their kids by looked at it incredulously. I think Cindy and I were partially to blame for their doubting, because if it weren't a hoax, wouldn't the two girls on the porch be *doing* something?

Around 8:38, Billy Mayo and his friend Joe came along. Billy was the type of kid who preferred tricking to treating. If you didn't watch your Jack-o-Lanterns closely, you'd inevitably find them smashed by Billy's clodhoppers.

Billy saw the body in the road, looked at us on the porch, all wide-eyed and staring at him to see what he would do, and then gave the body a real hard kick in the mid section. He held his foot there, smirking at us for a second, then looked down and kicked the body again, lighter this time. Then he nudged it.

""What is this full of, leave?"" he yelled over to us. We just sat there like deer in headlights and watched. He tried to roll the body over with one foot.

""Fuck, this is heavy."" he said, then he reached down and grabbed it round the shoulders to flip it over. Joe bent over to help, grabbing the legs. Cindy and I were leaning forward in our seats, trying to get a look. Billy got the body turned over, then dropped it heavily, causing Joe to drop his end. They both lurched back.

""Jesus fuck!"" Billy yelled, holding his hands up like he was trying to keep them away from the body. In the street light I could see, his hands and his jacket were all red and slick. Joe was turned away, and it sounded like he was vomiting. I dropped the candy bowl, spilling Kit Kats all over the porch. Cindy dropped her drink, shattering the glass. Both our jaws were dropped too. We had no idea what was going on, but we were riveted watching it all unfold.

""Maybe I should call the police now,"" Cindy whispered absently. She got up, moving stiffly, and went into the house. I just sat there. All I could see was red. The front of the body was nothing but dark, wet, red. Billy was standing there, his arms up in front of him, just looking at the blood all over them. Joe kept puking and fell over.

Police arrived minutes later. The ambulance took a while, since the nearest hospital was a good thirty miles away. They covered the body with a sheet. Billy and Joe were escorted gently away where they were talked to quietly until their parents arrived. Needless to say, Cindy and I were thoroughly interrogated. What did we see? When did we notice it? Why didn't we call the police immediately? The police officer who questioned me was very nice. He told me that we weren't in trouble, but that in the future we should always err on the side of caution. I asked him who the body was, but he didn't know.

Nobody knew who it was.",nosleep,Bellemaus,/r/nosleep/comments/fxipv/the_body_on_main_street/
69,A ghost in our house?,1299264755,"When I got home for lunch yesterday, my wife told me this little story.

Our 5 year old daughter came running up the stairs in a panic. Once in the kitchen with my wife she says ""Why is Grandpa in the computer room?"" My wife, confused, says ""Grandpa is not downstairs."" To which my daughter replies, ""Yes, he is. He was talking to me.""

Now my daughter loves to watch her PBS shows, but refused to go downstairs for the rest of the day.

70,The wind in the rows,1299260457,"My whole family knows, I'm terrified of cornfields. On cross-country road trips, they know, we drive through states with cornfields during the day... Or avoid them entirely. My brother laughs at me, mocking my weakness. My mom tells him to knock it off, but writes my fear off as some oddity I developed from watching too many bad b movies. My dad though... He seems to understand.

When I was younger, I went to a mixed junior/high school. There, I discovered the inspiration of masters. Poe, Hugo, Wells... One day even, King. Once I began reading King, I noticed... more. My eyes were opened, so to speak. His everyday situations scared me, and still do, more than I care to admit. I checked out a copy of Night Shift one Friday, which was a mistake. 

You see, Night Shift is a collection of short stories. And in said collection, there's Children of the Corn. I read the book over the weekend. I'm an extremely avid reader, you see. I can't remember any of the other stories, but I'm sure they scared me a bit. On Monday, I returned the book and checked out I-forget-what. Unimportant. For the rest of the week, I would ruminate on that story. The isolation. The theocratic sort of society the children had. Their cruelty. The fact that adults, the be-all, end-all saviors of my ten year old mind, could not stop them. 

The following Friday, a week after checking out that book, the book, the one I'll never forget, we went on a field trip. I lived in Maryland at the time, and we were studying the early colonists. We wound up at a working tobacco plantation. It was an archaic example of how our forefathers used to turn a profit. The crowning glory, however, was a maze, in the tobacco field.At the end of the growing season, the stalks got to be about five or six feet in height, and much like a corn maze, was only effective for children.

I thought nothing of it. 

My friends challenged me to a race, to see who could get through the quickest. I surveyed the maze from a hill, quickly finding my way through the simple thing with my eyes. Not a problem at all I thought.

I was wrong, as I often am.

We began, yelling lightheartedly, our progress clearly heard by each other. Feet pounding, stalks crunching when we brushed against them... I decided to take a shortcut. I've always been competitive. And abysmally foolish as well, it seems. The minute I cut across the rows... The world fell nearly silent. I could hear my classmates as if from a great distance, muffled yells and laughter. 

The gentle breeze, before unnoticed, had it even been there? It grew chill, damp. Odors of wet soil, the distinctive scent of *night* drifted towards me. As it danced over the tall stalks, nearly a foot higher than I, they whispered. The leaves, brushing against each other seemed to murmur to me. I shivered. The sun, before so bright, now seemed dim, as if a cloud crossed it's path. I looked up. There was no cloud. I looked around. I was alone. 

Unbidden, images from the story, the one I loathe and can never seem to forget, came back to me. Sickles. Abandoned buildings. Death. Decay. He Who Walks Behind The Rows. I was afraid.

The whispering of the leaves got louder. I heard quiet footsteps under the whispering. The murmur of leaf on leaf became terrible, a dark, perverse thing. The steps grew louder, closer. I sank to the ground, afraid, a rabbit caught out by a wolf. Adults couldn't stop it. I knew this. I was only a kid, one little kid who had laughed at the story. Stupid, I had said, totally-dumb-could-never-happen. 

I felt the earth beneath my hands, damp, and somehow cold at the end of this blazing Indian summer. I felt the sharp point of a rock. I lifted it, pondering. I wouldn't go down without a fight, I decided. Meek and mild wasn't my style. With that thought,  I hefted the rock, the size of my closed fist, and ran. 

Stumbling, crashing through stalks, careening out of control through the field, until I hit the other side. I fell out, gasping, with tears streaming from my eyes. I hadn't realized I was crying. The moment I pushed through the last row of stalks, life returned. The sun was blazing, suddenly, too bright. The chatter of my classmates, too loud. The teacher eyed me, herded us all on the bus.

On the way home, I looked around. They all seemed happy, relaxed. I hated them. I felt aloof, jaded, still half scared out of my wits and powered by adrenaline. I shook slightly, a fine tremble all over. I looked down, in my lap, at my hands. Earth clung to them, dark, damp, under my nails, coating the rock I didn't realize I still held. 

When I got home, my dad took one look at me and knew something was up. He took me to the garage. I told him, haltingly, what had happened. I watched, as he grew pale. He hugged me, it was too tight. He pulled back, holding my shoulders still, and told me very seriously, to stay away from fields that were taller than me. Told me that sometimes... Sometimes, it was perfectly right to be scared. Told me to keep my rock if I liked. 

It still sits on my nightstand. Sometimes, I catch dad holding it, thinking, too pale for our perpetual tans. 

I've never asked. He grew up New Mexico. Around where he grew up, there are miles, miles and acres, of corn fields.",nosleep,zombiemommy,/r/nosleep/comments/fxe5p/the_wind_in_the_rows/
71,A Lucid Nightmare,1299247133,"Jesus. The kinds of things the mind can come up with. I don't know why. What purpose it serves. Last night I experienced one of the most truly disturbing and terrifying things I can imagine. I had a nightmare, but one where I was fully conscious. Fully aware. It felt like reality. Fuck. Remembering it now is painful. I swear on everything holy that I just dreamt this. And I know it wasn't real. But...

I was at a friend's house. My father and mother were talking to the single parent of the house. He was the father of either Maddie or Jamie, the friends who were with me. I think it may have been Maddie's father. I do not know for sure. He was a pig farmer. He had a large property. We were bored. Me and Jamie wanted to have a joint. Maddie wanted to come along, but not smoke. We went alongside one of the barns, and lit up. We didn't know he was inside. We didn't know what kind of person he was. He slammed open the barn doors, and then snatched jamie and maddie, holding them tightly, bruising their forearms. He had been butchering a pig. He was covered in blood. I had managed to hide. He didnt see me. I quietly followed him, still pulling my friends along. I figured he was taking them to the house to call their parents. I just thought we were busted. I didn't know. Fuck. I watched him bring them not into the house, but a small green building. To the back of his property. 

The smell of rotting meat pervaded the air. I walked up to the back of the building, the one opposite the single entrance, and looked at what was happening inside through a crack in the wood. What I saw next was perhaps the most gruesome, disturbing, horrifying thing I can imagine. The building was a slaughterhouse. He put the two into a small transparent, plastic room. They were partially blocked from sight by the presence of a massive, steel pole. 2 feet in diameter. It looked like an extended gear that reached from floor to ceiling. Immediately adjacent to it, on the left, was a concrete wall. The man hit a switch. The pole began spinning counterclockwise. Slowly. Always slowly. And then, one wall of the small, transparent room, began to compact. Pushing maddie and Jamie, ever closer, slowly, into the massive pole, a meat grinder. 

Oh god, I can still  hear the screams. Jamie went first. His body was pulled into the spinning pole by the gear. Crushed between the wall and the unstoppable, powerful grinder. His screams were earsplitting. The pole had difficulty crushing him at first. It slowed. The lights inside dimmed. Then, as his bones cracked and gave way to the machine, it began turning again. His screams stopped. His mutilated corpse started to spew from the other end. His skull, cracked in two, his brain spattering the floor. Blood covered every surface. Flashes of white were his bones, smudges of yellow and brown, his organs. All that remained of him, one of my best friends, was a pile of gore. Then Maddie. Oh god. I should stop writing this for my sanity's sake. But I can't.

Her hair pulled her in. Her screams were earsplitting. I watched in unimaginable horror. He skull broke open. Her beautiful face stretched and tore. Her screams stopped. I watched her gray matter leak and squirt through the other side. then the same unspeakable spectacle. The crack of her bones. The lights dimming as the grinder strained. Then the blood and gore out the other side. The man grunted, turned off the machine, and left. My mind was paralyzed, overwhelmed with the unspeakably brutal and disturbing murders I had just witnessed. I ran and ran and ran to my parents, who were waiting outside. I couldn't even scream. 

They asked me what was wrong. I couldn't speak. My mind had been ravaged. I managed to whisper, ""We need to leave now. Now. Please."" They complied. As we pulled out of his driveway, I began to say that he murdered them. That they were fucking dead. Oh god. As we began to speed up downhill on the long driveway, I heard a burst of gunfire. My mother, who was driving, suddenly slumped. Red covered the windshield. I started to scream. The car crashed. More red. I hit my head. I began to lose consciousness. I didn't stop screaming. It was nothing more than a wail now. The hollow, dead sound an animal makes when it knows it has no hope. I felt myself be lifted. I heard my father groaning. My mother was silent. I was being dragged, along with them. By who, I didn't know. To where, I didn't know. I passed out. I woke up briefly a short while later. The man who was dragging me was covered in red. I glimpsed a small green building in the distance.

After I woke up from this, I didn't immediately remember the part where I was killed. All I remembered was that Maddie and  Jamie were dead. I cried. I thought they were dead. I soon realized that it had been a dream. But I will never forget the feeling after I woke up. The sensation of my stomach dropping at the realization that my friends were dead. The realization that, though It had been a dream, my throat was raw. The taste of blood in my mouth. As if I had been endlessly screaming.",nosleep,lucidity5,/r/nosleep/comments/fx9ij/a_lucid_nightmare/

75,Stay out of the woods,1299231603,"I grew up in a very small village, a line of houses along a riverbank a couple of miles from town. My friends and I walked to school every day.  The road went a long way along the river before making a sharp turn towards town, so we would take a shortcut instead, a fun trek through the farmlands and the wooded area where we also loved to play.

I was nine years old the summer  there was a meeting of the residents. My parents came back from it visibly shaken. They informed me, in no uncertain terms, that I was never again to play in the woods, and that when school came back in session I was to walk along the road instead of taking the shortcut. I soon found all my friends had been told the same thing by their parents. Most of us obeyed.

A few didn't. 

A week or so after school started, one of the kids who had been taking the shortcut through the woods stopped showing up to class. He had gotten suddenly very ill. His family left the village to try to get him treatment in the city. Kids being kids, most of us thought it was weird but otherwise didn't think much of it.

We were years and cities away by the time my mother finally told me what happened.

There had been a murder in the woods that summer. One of the neighbors found a woman's body with her head partially severed off, apparently by an axe. No one knew who she was and the killer had not been caught.
None of the children were told about it. We were simply ordered to stay out of the woods.  By the time school was back in session, no one was talking about this prohibition, and it didn't take long before a group of boys started walking to school using the shortcut through the woods again.

One morning, as they approached the woods, one of them yelled ""Race ya there!"" and started running. Before anyone could follow, he made a turn around a thick line of trees. No sooner was he gone from view than he came back, livid with horror, running past the other boys and back toward the houses. The other boys actually *laughed* at him, and kept going. He made it back to his house, grabbed a desperate hold of his dumbfounded mother, and collapsed. When he came to, he couldn't speak. He  went in and out of shock for days, unable to articulate a single word.

His parents took him to a psychiatric clinic in the city, where, eventually, he was able to relate what he saw.

As he ran around the thickest part of the woods and out of view from the other boys, he saw a woman sitting on a fallen tree trunk. She turned, stood up, and held her arms out to him. As she rose, her head fell from her neck, swinging upside down in front of her chest, held by nothing but a piece of skin, her eyes never  leaving his.

A week or so ago, a friend of mine, Tyler, was accidentally shot in the neck with a shotgun by his best friend. He died a few seconds after being shot. He was loved by most people, and it was pretty devastating for most of my friends.

This morning, a mutual friend (who happened to be in love with Tyler) contacted me, because she said I had an ""Open mind"". We had the following back-and-forth, it was very short.

Her: ""Hey, this is random and we haven't talked for some time but I know you of all people have an open mind... have you ever had like the most creepiest dream and felt it was actually happening... like there was a stranger in your room?""

Me: ""It sort of sounds like a form of lucid dreaming or something.""

Her: ""Can ya tell me how to stop it? Cuz I'm scared to sleep.""

I told her I may know some people who could help, and asked her to send me more details via an email.

Later, she sent me the following email, spelling errors included:

""OK. so best way to sum it up... (and the way your photo is staring at me is really uber creeping me out) anyways...the first paranormal activity...if you found yourself sitting through that... - the wedgie board, moving chandeliers, lame ass ending...and the photo. yada ya.

I wrestled with it...I was not in sleep paralysis. I woke shelby up from all my commotion. I believe I screamed but i'm not sure...that was my worst one...a night or two before that happened (this was the night after Tyler passed I believe) I had seen a thin figure (but to large to be tyler) at the end of my bed, at first I was scared, but then I felt peaceful...the second time...was an attack. :/""

78,Why do you no longer sleep at night? Here is the source of my desire to remain awake eternally. ,1299212313,"I began not sleeping at night around the age of **7** when we moved into our new home from what is now our guest house. Even though my family felt it was time for us to make the residential transition, we still have a few rooms in the house the were incomplete, including the room that I lived in prior to attending university. Because my room was deemed unsafe, I had to sleep in the extra room in our basement for the time being. There were no lights in our basement what so ever, so I had to descend into [darkness](http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhijo88m4Q1qhp8yoo1_500.jpg) slowly and navigate my way to the temporary room. In the room there was nothing but a bed, a mirror, and a makeshift light source. The bed itself faced an opening in the ceiling that exposed the space between said ceiling and the floorboards above, from which every noise in the house would resonate, with distortion, non-stop. One night, around 2am, I awoke to hear heavy breathing coming from the hole. The switch to the light was directly under the source of the breathing so I lay in bed paralyzed, accepting my inevitable demise as both the exit to the room and access to the light switch were in proximity to the sound and it was pitch black. There came an added scrapping sound that I presumed were fingernails tearing into the material comprising the space within the opening. The breathing continued to build in volume and intensity, as did the scrapping which was no accompanied by and occasional thud and the sound of something heavy dragging itself toward the [hole](http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhijh0lpBm1qhp8yoo1_500.jpg) .Nearer and nearer to the opening the noise came, until finally, it ceased entirely. There was nothing... silence, pitch black darkness penetrated only by the accelerated rate at which my heart was  beating..... I felt as if I was floating within a void. And then CRASH. Whatever was producing the noise fell through the opening, knocking down the temporary light fixture; glass shattering and spreading itself all over the ground... And then nothing once again. My my heart was doing everything in its power to burst forth through my sternum and flee from the danger that my body could not. 

*Heavy Breathing* It started again. This time from the ground, and it was making its way toward the foot of my bed, the shards  of glass crunching beneath the weight of its body, giving away its position as it neared. It was very close now, I could hear the breathing approach the right side of my bed. Something began tugging at the sheets, causing me to shift slightly. Again, everything stopped and became once more silent. I now thought, ""had I given away my position, has my presence been realized""? I felt the eyes of whatever the organism was penetrating my very flesh, dissecting and determining the optimal method in which to dispatch me. *SUDDEN, RAPID HEAVY BREATHING* Then an awkward, horrifying growl. I regained my composure and leapt forth from my bed, landing barefoot upon the jagged shards of glass, not giving a shit about the pain, and booking it up the stairs from the basement into the kitchen, grabbing a hunting knife and a flash light. It was there i remained, feet bleeding upon the cool surface of the tile floor, until my family returned home..... My father eventually went downstairs to confront the mystery being. Low and behold, I was made victim by an extraordinarily disgruntled, pregnant possum that had become trapped within the walls of our house. Fuck... From that point on I had trouble sleeping at night. 

Also, to make matters worse, the room I eventually moved into had a similar opening in the closet, which served equally as a source of fear upon the grudge being released in America.  


*I actually have several stories about various events that occurred at the residence I lived in previous to college, as it is in the country, an abandoned schoolhouse that we purchased and remodeled. There was an old butcher shop next to our house with an attic that we remodeled into a guest house and an old shed at the edge of the forest full of all sorts of pretty tools. Up the street there is an abandoned suburb that had about 50 people at its highest population who eventually up and left, the forest overgrew the entrance and the houses are empty, some still with furniture and cars in front of them. There are lots of nice things for future posts.*",nosleep,cathartic_catalysis,/r/nosleep/comments/fx1mp/why_do_you_no_longer_sleep_at_night_here_is_the/

[Day 2](http://redd.it/fs50p)    
[Day 3: Part 1](http://redd.it/funvv)    

There was still daylight left as the evening came, so we immediately set out to search for my cousin. We split into two parties, one big team which went off into the woods right away, and a smaller team consisting of my sister, little cousin, my Mom and myself, which headed to the store again to get some additional help from the local resort (the resort/store/stream are all situated in one area). With almost the entire lake resort helping out, it was only a matter of time before we found him.

It was then that I remembered hearing my cousin screaming earlier when we were walking back from the store. I had completely forgotten this when I was explaining to everybody everything that was going, so I made sure to mention this to my Mom. There are several trails in the area, and the forest/bush was pretty thick at this time of year; it was hard to imagine him going off trail, so we narrowed our search area. Fortunately for us, there is a shortcut to the trails at the top of the stream, so that’s where we headed.

My gut was telling me we were in trouble, partly because it was getting dark fast. It didn’t help matters much when the flashlights we were all using starting casting shadows everywhere. My mind started playing tricks on me…at least I had hoped it was all in my mind. From behind every tree, I could see those figures moving with the shadows; there was a certain grace to it, oddly. This time they weren’t distracting me away from everybody, they were just there.

I heard my cousin scream from behind me and, thankfully, so did everybody else. I’m not sure how we missed him; he was close to the top of the stream. In any case, we found him, but he was pinned underneath the ATV. With everybody there we had no trouble getting him free with almost no incident.

I say ‘almost’ because of what we found underneath him. The ATV must have have flipped in such a way to tear up the ground fiercely.  Underneath the dirt, tree branches and mud was a partially decomposed hand. Everybody instantly froze. Some of the people that were there tended to my cousin and took him to the resort to get him cleaned up and checked out, and to call the nearest authorities. My mom took me with to the resort while my Dad stayed behind to help investigate the area. My cousin was in shock; a little cut up, but otherwise he was fine. We stayed until the authorities and ambulance arrived (this took a while because of the remote location).

After a few hours of questions from the authorities and the paramedics giving my cousin a clean bill of health, we were free to head back to the cabin. By then it was pretty late, so we went inside and got a fire going in the fireplace. My dad eventually got back from helping out, but he was covered in mud and what looked like scratch marks. He was also zoned out and pale. I knew he saw something. I knew I wasn’t going crazy. He didn’t say much, but he looked at me, closed his eyes, and then let out a long sigh. After taking a shower he headed straight to bed. We all agreed with the notion, and then called it a night.

85,A short story based on a dream I had last night,1299174845,"Kick the shit out of me guys. It's my first attempt at creative writing.


I picked up the old ebony bracelet at a car boot sale. It was black and heavy and slightly rounded at the edges with what I hoped was years and years of use. The wood felt hard but warm and exuded faint aromas of wood polish and beeswax. Scratched on the inside of the bracelet was a seemingly random collection of letters: “mbeleni”

I wore the bracelet every day after it’s purchase, removing it only to shower and to sleep. When not adorning my wrist, it took pride of place on my nightstand, next to my bedside lamp. I liked to think that when I turned the light off, the bracelet gave off a warm comforting darkness that helped lull me to into slumber. This, of course was my imagination. However, this never stopped me gazing at the black of the bracelet under the dim light that penetrated my bedroom.

I fell asleep like this every night for almost one month. During this time my sleep was fitful, and peppered with the usual variety of random dreams. One night, after a particularly stressful and energetic day, I slumped into bed, too exhausted to remove clothing or jewellery. 

What seemed like mere seconds after succumbing to sleep I awoke with a start. A growing feeling of dread permeated me, a feeling I did not understand. My surroundings were as I had left them when I fell asleep, yet, there were subtle differences. My clothing was piled haphazardly on the chair in the corner of the room, yet I fell asleep fully clothed. The door to my bathroom was open and the light was on. I had not showered that evening, had not even ventured to the toilet. The shower was running. 

The sound of the shower running was shock enough in itself. The sound of the shower turning off turned my dread to real fear. I stiffened, barely daring to breathe as whoever had just used the shower went about the business of grooming as if they had the right to be here. As if this was their home.

The click of the light switch signalled that they had finished. I closed my eyes, fear penetrating every fibre of my being.
I dared to take a glance at the person who had infiltrated my home. One glance and I would decide how to react. Fight or flight all rested upon this one brief glimpse. As the intruder came through the doorway, my reaction was neither fight nor flight. I can only describe it as primal fear mixed with utter confusion. “I”  stood before me.

Except it was me only in a superficial sense. I looked drawn and pale, hungry even. Darkness circled my eyes.  My other self dropped the towel to the floor revealing my once flawless skin to be covered in sores and bruises. There was an anger about the other me; a tangible malevolence and hatred. I noticed that “I” was not wearing my bracelet and in it’s place was what looked like an open flesh wound, a burn perhaps. 

“I” continued with my standard grooming schedule, seemingly unperturbed that “I” was lying in bed watching this normal routine with abject horror. I felt I must be in the middle of a nightmare. It was the only rational explanation for this encounter with myself. Once again I clenched my eyes closed and willed myself to awaken. This nightmare continued as “I” lowered myself into bed next to me.

The light clicked off bringing a shudder that rocked through me like a thunderclap. This, I thought to myself, must be the end of the nightmare, the part where I wake up. A shuffling next to me brought these thoughts to a crashing halt. I felt a breath next to my ear, smelt what can only be described as spoilt meat. A voice crackled from the darkness: “I can take my bracelet now, or we can wait two weeks….”

92,The steps get louder every day.,1299131380,"First off, I'm not the best story teller but I need help,  I thought I was making it up, I wanted to believe that and for the longest time I did. 

I live in a medium sized house, pretty standard, two rooms, a full kitchen bathroom, basement blah blah, anyways couple weeks ago i noticed a door down in my basement right next to my washing machine, no I haven't lived in this house forever and was completely oblivious to this door, the thing I noticed is there is a name scratched into it now, it says Arry, I passed it off as I must not have payed any attention to this detail for my entire time I've been here. Another thing is this door does not have a handle there is absolutely no way of opening it without breaking through it (its boarded up from the inside and i cant ply it open).  Now it was cracked open just enough to see a dark gap, I opened it further and was freaked out, there, nothing just a cold damp place with a bucket in the middle and a drain, i searched for a light but couldn't find one. The next day I asked our landlord about the door and he said no ones been in there for ten years, I asked if he knew who lived there before us, he didn't know. 

The stairs that lead down into the basement are right by my room, Think of it being a cellar door right outside of a house going down except inside, so naturally I can hear when people go up and down it and I use it to get my laundry in the next load on time. My first night after discovering the door I heard a thump like someone stomped right onto the first step, the next night the same thing, passing it off as something else once it got to five and i could predict this i got spooked, i asked my mom about it and she didn't hear a thing. 

Just recently whatever this thing is has made it to the top of my stairs and I hear it in the kitchen from time to time, its made it into my living room and i can hear shuffling on our carpet inside the hallway leading up to my door, when i do i hear dog tags clinging together making a sharp ting in between the steps.

This is as far as i have gotten, tonight i predict it will be at my door and have been worried for some time now what i will do if i have to confront it, I've asked my mom about the people who lived here before us (she knew neighbors and been to dinner parties at this house) she said they had a little boy, around the age of 8 or 9 who was getting really sick and on the verge of a terminal illness, and that before he was sent to the hospital he was caught drowning his dogs, in the basement, in that room and with that bucket. 

When I think of this I'm not too scared, it has to be just some confused ghost kid who is lost possibly looking for some kind of forgiveness or understanding. 

Is there anything I can do to prepare for this situation, and is there any failsafe I can use if this turns out to be a hostile spirit?

Edit: This just struck me as I was about to go to sleep, If there isn't an exit from that basement room besides that door, then how was it boarded up from the inside?

Update #1: I was right, whatever this is came up to my door and stayed there all night, I couldn't hear breathing, whispering, clanging of dog tags just silence. Thats what was strangest of all this house makes so much noise and now everything was quiet like some one had hit mute for the entire world. Eventually I went to sleep,but couldn't get a good rest knowing whatever it is, is outside my door. 
When I came home today I thought I'd go have a look at this room again, now the door is shut and childish drawings have shown up on  the walls, one looks like a T.V I'm guessing. The door is shut now and I have a feeling I wont be able to get into it again. Hopefully this means its stopped.

Update #2: IT IS NOT OVER, /r/nosleep I want you to know I went through the most terrifying 25 seconds of my life for this pic, http://i.imgur.com/ooS4d.jpg its of the door with his name on it, I was about to go to the childish drawings when I heard a rustle I looked behind me (foolishly) and my gaze went straight to under the stairs where I saw him, Arry just staring at me he looks like a normal kid but his eyes, that innocence was gone, his breathing was harsh and raspy, I heard movement up stairs then all around me, then something bumped inside the door i cant open, after that I just blanked out and took off my mind went into I'm not giving a fuck mode and i screamed and punched the thin air thinking if this little kids gonna take me out I'm gonna kick his protoplasm 
ass!

Update #3: Sorry for the pause in updates, my mom decided after I told her about the things going on and how freaked out i was, so she decided a three day weekend in another town in a hotel would be best...this was the worst time of my life! Besides no internet, being in a town whom i know no one in! My mom was really here on a business trip leaving me alone with the 4 channel t.v station the hotel provided. Now before i left everything seemed to be fine i put salt everywhere after my little fiasco and the I stopped hearing steps going up the stairs, well while sitting watching some bull crap cooking show i noticed that my window's shades were drawn back, didn't think much of it so i went to close them and in the reflection there was Arry his head peeking up behind the bed i was just laying on i froze, when i looked back he wasn't there but when i looked back at the window he was standing up now, I decided to balls up and confront him, When i opened my mouth he was gone that night i heard the bathroom door open and im directly in front of it i could see his head peeking at me through the crack just staring at me, this is my new horror, every night he opens a door and peeks at me through it. I dont know what to do the salt doesn't work, i have no video camera, and no one believes me! 

Final update #4: I dont know what to do, tried everything, Arry is just not going away, ive decided that until he makes a move ill have to deal with him so i will, for now nothing dangerous is happening, but I am planning on going down to the basement and ripping off the door and just be done with whatever he is doing. This bull shit waiting game has gone on long enough and so I'll take it to his house for once!",nosleep,RetroGibbon,/r/nosleep/comments/fwcje/the_steps_get_louder_every_day/

So auditioning for the school play was a big leap and change of character, one I felt I had to jump into or regret forever. 

I hid a guilty pride after belting out my song and seeing the drama teacher’s jaw drop. She cast me as Harold Hill in The Music Man; Kelly played my girl in the show, Marian. 

We hadn’t talked much before the play despite the fact that we’d been enrolled in the same classes since grade school. Once we were in rehearsals, it became easier and easier to communicate, with acting, I finally had something to talk about. It was the first time I felt close to a woman. We would joke and address each other in character, it was corny, but I secretly loved it. Casual remarks like, “How far into that essay are you, Harold?” or “Meet me at Jamba Juice to go over lines, Marian?” were a part of our regular dialogue. So it was no surprise to me that after I kissed her for the first time she blushed and whispered, “I think I really like you, Harold Hill.” 

The play went down as all high school plays do, brief and forgotten. Kelly and I stayed together though. We went to prom together, graduated and explored what it meant to be in a relationship, we turned into what I can only assume people called “a clingy couple”. It wasn’t until we were enrolled in the same college that I matured into the idea that this shouldn’t be permanent and I might be feeling trapped. Now I wish I’d had the sense to treat the situation like an adult at the time. 

I was cheating on Kelly but she was far from done with me. She loved me and I suspect she had no idea; I did my best not to seem guilty all the time. I don’t know why I didn’t break it off. I suppose I never liked the person I was sleeping with enough to end the three-year relationship I was a part of and at the same time was a rotten enough person not to give a shit about Kelly’s feelings. 
I think the first real emotion I’d felt in over a year came after I felt my phone’s vibration go off from the jean’s pocket round my ankles as I straddled my affair from the side of her bed. I remembered at that moment, I’d told Kelly to meet at our apartment for lunch. It wasn’t her texting though, it was our roommate John, and I knew something was wrong instinctively. 

His message was vague so I cleaned up and called him from outside. I’ll never forget the tone of his voice, his speech was cracked and it was clear he’d been crying, “Hey man, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Kelly had an accident. She was leaving the apartment in heels and she must have lost her balance. She fell down the stairs. She’s not okay, you need to go to the hospital.” I didn’t even say goodbye to the girl I was with before driving off. 

Kelly was already gone when I got there. My heart sank and I went into autopilot, “Can I see her?” Someone said, “Sure.” I don’t remember much. I remember holding her cold hand and apologizing over and over, I remember confessing the affair, I remember crying like a child and grabbing at her chest sobbing into the hospital sheets. I heard a gurgle come from her throat that made me leap from the bed. A second later someone called me out to talk to her mom on the phone. 

Three years passed and I got a job as a recruiter for a temporary placement agency. I lost what friends I had in college and was happy to. The pain stayed with me, I never resorted to anti-depressants, I never felt I deserved them. I made enough to live alone and get by, which was good enough for me. It was at this time I finally let a co-worker set me up on a date. I felt pitiful the whole time but she was nice about it. When I got home it was late, I lay on my side in the dark and stared at the stars through the space between the curtain and the wall.

That’s when I heard something faint, almost as if it existed barely at my ear, “I really like you, Harold Hill.” I shot up and turned on my bedroom light to an empty room. 

Weeks passed and I became closer to Faye, my first attempt at a relationship since Kelly. One night I made my move and invited her over “for coffee”. We had sex that lasted a sad amount of time and she cuddled up to me on the bed. I drifted off into unconsciousness with the first warm feelings had since the accident. At three in the morning I awoke to a shriek. Faye was squatting at the head of the bed swinging her arms and darting her head about. I tried to relax her, held her close, she cried and calmed down. I got her a glass of water and had her explain the nightmare to me. 

“I was standing at the top of these stairs and this girl, this angry girl, she pushed me. She pushed me down the stairs and I watched my legs crack in two at the middle. She started laughing and laughing. Oh God it was horrible.” I felt sick to my stomach. “It was just a dream.” I cautioned. 

Faye and I didn’t last. Our schedules were too different and she never liked coming over after the nightmare. She never admitted it, but I’m sure there had been more. I would see her tossing and turning through the night and when she slept over my room would grow unnaturally cold. I live in south Florida. 

Months later I went to a friend’s birthday at a bar and met a girl. We got drunk and found our way back to my place. I don’t remember much of the events leading up to passing out in our drunken stupor but I remember my dreams that night. I saw Kelly sitting on her staircase, the sky rained high heel shoes that cut into my naked body. I begged her to stop but she didn’t say anything. She only smiled. Suddenly I couldn’t breathe, I woke up to my hook up with her hands round my neck and her eyes rolled back. I made choking noises and she snapped out of it. She didn’t remember what happened and panicking at her own actions, fled my apartment without a ride home. 

I try calling to let her know it’s okay sometimes. I ask if she wants to go out on a date. She never gives me a definite yes or no. We just have these long pauses between awkward conversations. Every now and then I hear familiar music from a Broadway show in the background of the call. 

“There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you.”

And I find myself humming along and crying at the same time.

97,The Rocking Chair,1299121682,"Yesterday, we had an estate sale at my grandparent's house.  The house was filled with all kinds of stuff, and surprisingly most of it sold, although people weren’t shy about bartering.  When the dust had settled, only a few items remained.  My parents and I kind of picked through the stuff, deciding for each whether to donate or to haul it home.  When I got to the back room of the house, I noticed an old chair that I hadn’t seen before; it must have been somehow hidden behind something that was sold.   It was an older style rocking chair, coated in a deep black with hand painted golden vines adorning the top.  It was the best looking piece of furniture that had been in the house, but had somehow escaped the grasp of the storming army of bargain-finders.  I hoped to take it home, so I kind of mentioned it mildly to my mother, who dismissed it with a wave, saying “take anything you want, we just want it out of here”.  So with that, I loaded it into my Jeep.

The chair felt strangely heavy as I carried it into my house, but I figured it was old and solid, and that meant some extra weight.  I carried it straight up the steps and into my room, placing it in the corner facing my bed.  It looked great there, resting calmly, its deep black color in beautiful contrast with the off-white walls.  I sat down and rocked for a bit and was surprised at how comfortable it actually was.  Maybe it would be my new reading spot.  After a few minutes, I shut down for the night and crawled into bed, pretty happy with my new acquisition.  It only took a few hours for me to change my mind.

I awoke at 3:32 am, the bright red lights of my bedside alarm clock staring at me, wondering what I was doing up.  I was wondering the same thing until I heard the creaking.  My eyes darted right, but I didn’t turn my head.  I was doing that stupid thing where you think if you don’t move you will be safe.  It didn't help.  I could see the dark chair moving slowly, rocking with a range so slight that without the accompanying creak I probably wouldn’t have even noticed.  I reached out as quickly as possible and flipped on my reading light.  In the movies, this is where the chair stops.  In my life, it didn’t stop.  The steady rocking continued until I forced myself to get out of bed and walk over to the chair.  I touched it slightly and it didn’t resist, steadying under my hand.  I stood there for a second, wondering what the appropriate course of action would be.  Coming up with nothing, I slunk back into bed, hoping I could fall back asleep and move the chair in the morning.  I decided to leave the reading light on.

I must have drifted off slightly, as the next time I looked at the clock it was 4:32.  The chair was creaking again.  Again I moved my eyes to the right.  This time, I could see something else there.  It looked like a darkness that was consuming the light from my lamp.  It  was covering most of the chair, with a section rising above the top rail that resembled a head.  It took more courage to move this time, but after thirty seconds of sweaty suspense, I couldn’t stand it anymore, and I whipped my head towards the chair.  It continued to rock, but the shadow, the darkness, was gone.  I again walked over to stop the rocking, and when I put my hand on the handle, I could feel warmth rising from it.  I picked the chair up immediately and took it downstairs.  I’m getting rid of it in the trash this week.

I’m sitting in bed right now and I can still hear the rocking all the way from downstairs.  It’s been going on since I came back up here an hour ago.  I’m too scared to go back downstairs now, so I am going to ride it out, I guess.  I swear I heard it stop about ten minutes ago, and I could feel the relief washing over me until I heard the footsteps coming towards the stairs.  I was getting ready to open the window or jump under the bed when the footsteps stopped at the foot of the staircase.  A few minutes later the rocking started again.  I just need to make it through the night.  Tomorrow I’m throwing the chair out.  I just hope he doesn’t come upstairs.",nosleep,plat00n,/r/nosleep/comments/fw9c6/the_rocking_chair/

1,Kinda lame story (IMO) a friend told me to submit,1299105264,"The night grew weary and the trees began to take on their malicious shadowy figures that you become accustomed to with the forecoming of twilight. The phantasmal darkness, a darkness I had not experienced since childhood, a darkness where I did not feel safe, and since I am an adult, I quickly threw off these morbid thoughts, of boogeymen, and monsters residing in my wardrobe. For how silly, and quaint it was of me, to think monsters suddenly materialise in the night, and stay within my closet for the entire night, with no sudden ill attempts at my life, but still impossibly terrifying nontheless. A darkness when I would seek refuge within the bosom of my parents
their love acting as some kind of forcefield to prevent monsters from reaching the impregnable fortress of my mothers room as similar in design, build and material to mine, yet with one aspect my room had somehow not been given during manufacture. 

It was around 2 or 3 am when i startled awake as if my pillow had thrown me upward at great speed. As I fumbled for my glasses, my eyes decieved large towering infernals looming and meandering towards me I hastened the search for my glasses and threw them on my face, and ran to the lightswitch on the wall. How preposterous it truly was, that my adult brain had allowed me to imagine such childish things; ghouls, boogeymen and large shadowed monsters 
""BAH!"" I yelled in angst. I quickly settled but leaving my lights on as to ward away evil, that lives in my closet regardless of light, at least this way I could see what would eventually be my demise. right? 

I awoke again after what seemed like minutes in a cold sweat, the light still on the door ajar, I swore it was closed but played it off as a forgotten process i went through when i turned on my light. As my eyes scannned the room, I noticed something eerily odd, so terrifyingly dull that it seems of no importance as, for in the far left corner of my room below the windowsill, out of which the trees grew, taunted and rapped at my window, there was a dark spot.
This isolated occurance at the isolated spot in the isolated part of my room, surely, the light would illuminate the entire room?
surely the becon of hope could not pass over the scariest spot in the house? Yet it did. It did not light up that area, and as i felt my sanity drip away like a leaking faucet, the shadowy figure turned and surged forward, neither solid, liquid nor gas, my sanity drained I blacked out perhaps to never recall the face of the figure in the corner.

3,The Man in the Hallway,1299102151,"When I was younger, about 4 or 5 I used to have frequent night terrors. my bedroom was setup so that when I lay in bed I faced out into the hallway. It wasn't a super long hallway by any means, but when it was dark you couldn't see anything. One night after a particularly bad dream I woke up and happened to be looking down the hallway. (my door was usually open so my parents could hear me) At the end of the hallway near my parents room was a very faint green glow. Similar to the spots you see when you stare at a bright light. Thinking nothing of it, I closed my eyes and tried to go back to sleep. Thats when I started to hear a dragging sound.  I opened my eyes again and the same glow was there, but closer. I watched as it sort of wavered or flickered and began to move toward me making a faint dragging noise on the carpet.  I wanted to yell for my parents but I was too scared to make a sound. The shimmer got about halfway down the hall and disappeared.  That was the first incident. The very next day I was having dinner with my parents in our dining room.  My seat afforded me a view of the hallway entrance that was next to my parents room. I just happened to be looking in the hallway and saw a man in a trench coat and hat, walk into my parents room. Not a shimmery figure, not a shadow, a man. I couldn't see a face because the collars on the trench coat were raised. I remember dropping my fork and telling my dad ""Someone just went in your room!"" My parents thought I was joking at first but after seeing the terrified look on my face, my dad grabbed a bat and went in there. When he came out he had found nothing, but all of the mini blinds had been pulled up and the closet doors were open.  This was incident two. For the next two weeks, I would wake up and see this green vapor in the hallway intermittently.  After that, my brother was born and I moved into a different room and began closing my door.  I could still here the faint dragging and it started to occur every night for about a month. Following the month, my dog got out and was hit by a car and killed. The very next night, the dragging returned, but was followed by a new sound, the sound of my dog running down the hallway, towards the dragging sound.  There was a muffled thump, and from that moment on, there was never another dragging sound or vapor, or any other occurance.  I believe my dog came back and drove out whatever it was.  But that man in the hallway story still scares the shit out of me and my parents.",nosleep,terdfergussen,/r/nosleep/comments/fw2pt/the_man_in_the_hallway/
4,The Apartments (2),1299098301,"This was originally a comment, but I figured it'd be easier to post it so more people could give me their opinion.  


(1) Well, the apartment was decent sized, but the bathroom was actually very small. I remember these two drawers from a cabinet that were underneath the sink.. Everytime I would shower, I would hear like someone was messing with bottles or looking for something under the sink. I would peek out to look, but no one was ever there. I would also hear those cabinet doors open and slam shut, but I would never see anything. It always made me shower quicker and gtfo of there. 

(2) This is one of the scariest one for me. My mom used to sleep on the couch in the living room sometimes because she'd fall asleep reading the bible. On sevral occasions, she said she would see shadows in the kitchen and hear footsteps. (the living room was right across from the kichen) She would come and tell my brothers and I how she would see them just walking around the small area of the kitchen were we kept our silverware. 
One Summer night, she came over to tell us to go to sleep and that she had been hearing whispering and she was kinda scared. Being a summer night, we were all still fully awake so my mom was trying to freak us out by saying she could hear then coming closer. She kept saying ""Go to sleep, guys! Otherwise, the demons that come out at this time are going to get you!"" we kinda just sat there and laughed it off but I could tell my brothers were just as scared as I was and they too were trying to put a brave face on. We were all quiet for a minute until my mom broke the silence and said. ""y'know, sometimes... Even the devil comes out.."" as soon as she finished her sentence, we heard a huge bang in the kitchen. It was as if our entire kitchen had been struck by lightning or someone had run in and dropped a bunch of pots and pans straight to the floor. We stood there, motionless. I don't know how, but we managed to get up and go check it out. We found absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. 

(3) I used to have a small dog when we lived in the apt. She would often start growling at nothing or bark at random and the hairs on her back would stand on end. I remember one time I kept hearing soft footsteps around the kitchen and then she started barking. It creeped me out and I ran the fuck out of there!

(4) My mom's room seemed to have a lot of activity. I thought it was because she had bought some furniture off of an antique store and maybe the previous owner(s) had passed away and were attachted to it. She also had a wind up doll that my dad gave her for birthday one year. (it was also bought at an antique shop) one afternoon while my mom was at work my older brother and I were doing chores around the house. It was my turn to fold some laundry and store it in it's proper place. The problem was, it was mostly my mom's clothing. I knew I had to do it, but my moms room had always given me the creeps. I reluctantly went in there, closed the door and began folding. It wasn't long before I started hearing breathing. It came closer and closer until it was actually right behind me. It sounded as if someone was breathing heavily right next to my ear. I turned and the breathing stopped. I slowly turned around and continued folding and as soon as my back was to the door, the breathing continued. I ran the fuck out and closed the door. 
In that room, the doll would also start playing music randomly and also the tv would sometimes turn off on it's own. It was creepy as hell!",nosleep,MelissaMacabre,/r/nosleep/comments/fw18g/the_apartments_2/

6,Cactus Walking On 20 Legs Found In China,1299095594,,nosleep,CarryGaurd,/r/nosleep/comments/fw058/cactus_walking_on_20_legs_found_in_china/
7,I call him Joe.,1299093073,"Sorry this is so long in advance. 

It started when my brother was born and I moved from what is now his room into what was the guest room. I was six years old when it began, and whatever it was (I always came up with excuses, I was a logical kid, still am pretty logical), happened sporadically so I didn’t take much notice. Recently, though, it’s been happening again and more and more frequently, so I decided to post my experiences here. Keep in mind that my room is away from the rest of the house, it’s next to the laundry room and has a bathroom connected to it, which is also connected to my brother’s room. Both of our rooms also have thick sliding glass doors leading to the front yard, which can be locked from the inside. Keep in mind these are just the instances that stand out to me. 

Okay, so the first instance I remember was when I had first moved in. I was awoken suddenly by a loud noise and a light suddenly turning on in my bathroom. I look up, and the door to my bathroom is wide open (where it had been closed), and there is the large figure of a man looming in the doorframe, taking up most of it. I prop myself up and say “daddy?”, and the figure disappears, the door closes, and the light shuts off. Now, as a six year old I “laughed in the face of danger”, so I followed the figure to investigate. I found nothing. Doors were locked and closed, and everyone in my house was sleeping peacefully, including my dad and his faithful dog. I wrote it off as being a dream.

The second incident I remember was when I was about ten, and I was up late reading some book. I was curled up in bed and all of a sudden I felt something touch my leg, then I saw the edge of the bed sink down as though someone was sitting on it. I immediately ran to my parents’ room saying I had a stomach ache. 

The next was probably the scariest. I was a freshman in high school and was working on a group video project, so I had about five or six others from my class in my room while we were planning what we were going to be doing. All of a sudden, my alarm clock, which had been plugged into the wall, flies off my dresser and diagonally across my bedroom as though someone threw it, though no one was near it, and hits the wall, about six inches from one of the guy’s heads. I could not explain that and I still can’t.

I moved out my freshman year of college and my mom redid my room because ‘there was a smell’, though I never smelled anything, which she blamed on my pet rabbit and then my pet dog. I moved back in this past fall semester because I transferred to a more expensive school and its close enough so I can commute and save some money. It turns out it wasn’t my pets creating the phantom smell, but a leak inside the walls, near the shower (which is connected to my room). A leak no plumber seems to be able to stop no matter how much of the wall we tear up. Yes this seems pointless, but ever since we tore up the wall, something has woke me up with a jolt almost every night, and I’m normally good at sleeping throughout the night.

Last Friday night, I heard this loud banging that seemed to be coming from in the laundry room (or it could have been my closet), and it sounded like someone was either throwing something heavy around or throwing themselves against a wall. I thought it was my brother and his friend, but when I asked him about it, he said they fell asleep by about 2am, and this noise occurred around 4am. My dad heard the noise too, but though it was me getting ready for work. The next night, I get woken up at around 3am and I hear someone throwing something against the wall in my room repeatedly. This happened four or five times, until it stopped.

Other little things I can remember: the chain on my ceiling fan will start clanging really loudly, and I’ll tell it to stop, and it will. Random bumps in the night, never feeling alone in my room, and I can’t sleep in silence when in my room, where I can anywhere else.

8,"My first story, criticism welcome.",1299070593,"This is a summary of the writings of Norman, one of the court-people of king ferdinance the third of Hungary:


It was rumored that something haunted the king. I say rumored because most of us refuse to believe the recent happenings.

Ferdinance the third had his eye on a particular lady, which, unfortunately for him, was not only married but also rejected his attempts to romance her. Those people were simple peasants, Which meant they needed to live off by their power of will and their love, since resources were scarce. The husband was a simple gardener, in fact the king first met the lady when he summoned the gardener to take care of royal garden.
But Ferdinance did not let go of his obsession, being sure the problem is that the lady is blocked by her husband. 

What is well known about Ferdinance is that he was cruel. He sent people to lock the poor peasant in the castle, and when asked by the guards what to do the man, he simply replied “Just cut his face into two parts” in a calm, relaxed way.

The lady was sent into his palace, where the king greeted her with a wide grin, after which he simply turned to his guards, and said “lock her up, too”.  A few days after the incident the lady was found in her cell room, dead after she commited suicide using a vine which mysteriously sprouted and grown outside of her cell’s small window in a matter of days, or maybe even hours.

Years passed. The king has softened up – and moved from being hated among his people, to being accepted. He found himself a wife which he loved deeply, and finally cared for someone else more than he cared for himself.

Problem is, the king was haunted. Not by ghosts or the paranormal, but by vegetation. Vines would sneak into his room and the king would wake up in the middle of the night, having vines in the process of tightening around his neck, but not yet strangling. He could not stand being around his castle, he feared the corridors, the walls, and most of all – the yard and garden. One day, the king and his wife simply disappeared. The royal court was panicking, even after they found the place where he fled – a small cabin in the woods, far away from his castle.

It seems as the king wrote in his personal dairy, which became his will: “I see the vegetation growing, like a shadow digesting what is pure in this world, and I want to flee but I am controlled by an unknown force. I see a dried-out root, and I pick it up. It has a hole in it, with some sort of curved thorns around it. Suddenly, it tries to bite me. My sense kicks in, and I drop it, and on a second look the root is a normal dried-out root, the mouth made of thorns gone.”
The king continues on, “I know it will not stop. Eyes appeared, and the root has grown to a full face. He will not stop. He must know he is close, and I dare not take that step.”

Everything in the diary from then on, is blank, except a few scribbled sentences on the last page –
“He is smiling an unnaturally wide smile. I will not let him ruin my world. With my knife I have split his face, his smile not broken into two separate pieces. But this is not all I need to do to be free.”

At the cabin, the king’s wife was found – with her face split into two parts. The king was never found.

11,They're performing experiments on me...,1299059690,"I feel like I have something awful in me. Those terrible dreams... they've come true. They must have.

I've been having this nightmare lately. It started a few weeks ago; just once the first week, but now it's four or five times per week. I'm afraid to go to sleep - that's where they wait for me. To perform experiments on me. To turn me into... something.

It's always the same place, but it just gets more and more grotesque every time. The images eat away at whatever sanity I have remaining. I'm being wheeled on a gurney down this decrepid, sullenly lit hallway of an abandoned hospital. It's like what you would imagine Silent Hill to be, but you can taste the misery. I try to scream, but I'm gagged with a filthy rag that tastes like metal and sawdust. The straps holding me down feel like they're made of dried human flesh, and they're pulled so tightly I can barely feel my limbs. The whole aura of the place is tinged green with decay.

I'm brought to this bright room lit by a dozen old-fashioned lambs that nearly blind me at first as my eyes ache to adjust. The man who has been talking to me this whole time has me follow his finger with my stare, making sure I'm coherent enough to know what's going to happen next. Even though he's wearing a dirty surgical mask, I can tell he's smiling. A pale nurse hands him a syringe filled with inky black liquid, and the needle is rusted but sharp.

""This won't hurt a bit,"" he says, as he stabs the needle in my hand. As soon as I feel the pinch, I wake up.



I slept for hours last night. I don't know how long I was out, all I know is that the nightmare became my reality for longer than ever before. And now, [this](http://i.imgur.com/2xVnV.jpg) has appeared on my hand, in the same spot the needle went in. It hurts so much, and I'm doing all I can to not claw at it.

Help me, Reddit. Please. I don't want to sleep, but I can sense the time drawing near. It's dark and ebbing inside me like a dam has broken, about to wreak havoc upon the world. I'm losing myself.

Our campus radio station plays over the guide channel and we never know what music will be playing at this time of night.

Tonight, we turned on the guide channel and heard what sounded like rain.  We've heard ambient sounds on the channel before so we thought nothing of it.  My friend turned to me and said ""Oh, the sound of rain!""  Then the screaming started.

Just a little bit at first, but then it kept coming.  My friend said ""The sound of someone being murdered in the rain,"" and I was confused.  Then I heard it.  Just, screaming, under the static-y sound of rain.",nosleep,axel_val,/r/nosleep/comments/fvovo/tv_guide_station/
13,Why I hate wobbles,1299055375,"When I was a kid, my grandparents came over from China to take care of me while my parents worked.  One of the toys they brought over was one of those weebles with a weighted base so that it would tip, but never fall down.  This particular weeble had a very odd looking clown face painted on it.  I say odd because it wasn't exactly a friendly looking clown.  It's smile was too wide, its eyes were too dead, and its pupils were too small.  It was fucking creepy.  That's not the only thing that made this toy odd, however.  Whenever it was tipped or moved, it would laugh.  The laugh would start out low, get very loud, then trail off again...for as long as it was wobbling.  (heh heh heh HA HA HA HA heh heh heh)

One time, we were taking care of my uncle's puppy while he was on vacation.  The puppy was a ball of energy, and it was an awesome treat having him, save for one exception.  He would continuously knock the wobbly clown toy around at least twice a night, which was very disconcerting for me, considering I slept in the same room and was constantly woken in the night by the sound of mechanical laughter.  

It was the worst sleep I'd ever had in my life.  I'd beg my parents to let me sleep in their room because my young imagination kept me alert and terrified, waiting for the silence of the night to be broken by laughter of the hideous clown.

One night, I remember being awake long after midnight, dreading any noise and praying to any entity that would listen to please let the puppy keep still.  Just one night.  Inevitably, the mechanical laughter started.  I was terrified and extremely tense as I listened, waiting for it to stop wobbling.  When it did stop, I remember a wave of relief washing over me, thinking that would be the last disturbance I would have to endure from the thing, at least for that night.  I attempted to sleep.

Just as I was about to doze off, I was jolted awake again by the laughter.  Instantly, I was horrified.  Mainly because it was louder, meaning closer to my bed.  I whispered a reprimand to the puppy in the pitch black darkness, assuming he was pushing it around the room.  I laid in bed completely tense for what felt like hours, as the laughter continued and never seemed to cease.  At the same time it sounded like it was being rolled around the room, sometimes getting very close to my bed, then rolling back.  The sound of the laughing will stay with me forever.

Somehow, I succumbed to sleep (though I had horrible nightmares) because the first thing I did when I woke up at the crack of dawn was run to my parents room in tears.  I told them how much I hated that toy and how the puppy tortured me with it for nearly the entire previous night.  And the reason why this will haunt me for the rest of my life is because it was that moment they explained to me with much confusion that they had removed the batteries in the clown after the first night I complained.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fvoc6/why_i_hate_wobbles/
14,The Girl and Her Cat 2,1299054057,"Read this redd.it/fu57w before this experience, so you know what happened before.

Recently I posted an experience that I had when I decided to move out of my parents’ house and into my own apartment. After the experiences I moved back home because I was too horrified. That was a few months back, and everything seemed to return to normal. However, after just 2-3 days of posting my experience, weird things started to happen again.

The first experience was last night, I was home alone because my parents love to play Bingo and they don’t get home until about 1:30am. Around 11pm I started to watch a movie in the livingroom because I love the large screen and the amazing bass. The movie finished just around 1am and I decided to go to sleep. I was walking up the stairs and then I heard a cat meow. I froze instantly. 1) My parents are both allergic to cats/dogs and would never tolerate one being in the house. 2) My house has motion sensing lights in the kitchen and livingroom, as well as the entryway. The lights in the kitchen turned on. I know for a fact that I was home alone. Instead of being brave like before, I decided to just run to my bedroom, lock the door and force myself to sleep. This was difficult because the meow reminded me of the dream I had back at my former apartment and the claw scars on my chest.

Unfortunately it didn’t end there. I woke up at 4:15am, smelling something burning. I noticed that this was eerily similar to what happened before, but instead of 4:15am, I woke up at 3:15am. The burning smell didn’t go away and I thought I saw smoke. I didn’t want to wake my parents so I tip-toed (they are light sleepers) passed my parents’ bedroom and then proceeded to run, following the smoke trail. The trail led to the kitchen. I peered inside the room and saw a vanilla envelope burning on the stove (my family prefers gas stoves to electric). I quickly reached for the envelope and threw it on the ground, where I then started to stomp out the fire. The envelope had only just begun burning, which made me wonder why there was so much smoke. As I looked around, the smoke was completely gone. I opened the envelope and took out the contents. One was a note that said “Milo wanted to see you again.” The other was the same note that my landlord talked about. My blood ran cold, I was petrified. I heard another cat meow from the direction of the livingroom. I didn’t run through the livingroom, so the motion sensing lights didn’t turn on, but it is within view of the kitchen. Just above the couch I saw two glowing eyes (they looked like what cat eyes do in the dark), followed by another meow. I sneezed and the cat was gone.

I returned to my room with the vanilla envelope, but I was not scared. Instead, I felt a sense of fulfillment and resignation. I’ll keep Reddit up to speed if anything else happens.

P.S. Now that I look back on what happened, I probably sneezed both times because of this cat, but I am only mildly allergic to them.

15,There Are Monsters,1299051714,,nosleep,effinboy,/r/nosleep/comments/fvnke/there_are_monsters/
16,Tug of War,1299050540,"As a young child, I had severe night terrors that would frighten me to no end. Strangely enough, little else scared me while I was awake. I even found comfort hiding in my closet reading Goosebumps books to stave off sleep instead of being terrified by it. Perhaps my own form of immersion therapy so as to make my fears less intense. Some nights, however, I still remember feeling like my house wasn't exactly filled with only a human presence.


One of these weary nights, I was reading a Sesame Street book all cozy in the bottom bunk of my bunk bed. My siblings slept in the other beds and my parents were fast asleep down the hall, leaving only me and my imagination awake to entertain ourselves. As I mentioned, I would read when I couldn't sleep at night (which was nearly every night), but something about this particular night felt... off.


As I lay there, reading with only the moonlight streaming in from my bedroom window substituting as my flashlight, I realized how cold the room had gotten when I saw my breath before me. In an attempt to beat the night chill, I set my book down next to me and pulled my heavy quilts up closer to my chin. Because of this, the book slid down and fell into the crack between the wall and my bed. Instinctively, I reached down to retrieve my lost treasure without even thinking about it. As I was pulling the book up, however, I felt a slight tug on the end of it as thought it were caught on something. Like this would keep me from my Grover!


I pulled, *IT* pulled back.


I pulled again using both hands, and *IT* pulled back *STRONGER*.


I looked down as I tugged one last time, and a flash of a pale, long-fingered thin hand could be seen then even in the darkness. It was almost like a hand that had been stretched to three times normal size and the fingernails pointed out like small knives.


All of a sudden, the child in me reeled with fear as I thought of all those terrible stories about things that go bump in the night. Now, would I try to get my book back or face certain death? I'll admit, I was one risk-loving kid. This was nothing to be fooling with, though.


So, after one last tug, I let go.


The book hit the hardwood floor with a *THUD* and I heard a scrapping under my bed like thick nails on a chalkboard. As stiff as a board, I didn't move an inch except to dart my eyes to my sleeping sister in the bed ten feet away. All I heard was the soft snore from the unmoving form, as well as from my dreaming little brother in the above bunk. I spent the next hour in terror and with bated breath, demanding my ears to analyze every noise. Exhaustion overcame me, and I must have drifted off to sleep under my protective mound of quilts.


The next morning I awoke thinking it had just been a figment of my lovely imagination. So I went under the bed to retrieve my cherished possession... only to find it nowhere to be found.


All that was left was a deep scratch in the floor next to where the book should have been.",nosleep,skyylineddrive,/r/nosleep/comments/fvn9n/tug_of_war/
17,Blank.,1299048209,"I wrote this more than a year ago and posted it in several places. I found it again today, and thought you might like it.

I'm pretty freaked out.
That thing has been there for almost a week. The figure in the window. It looks featureless, only skin on a human frame, and it's pressing itself against the glass somehow. I don't know how it got there, and I don't know how to get rid of it.
At first I thought it was a prank, a doll or mannequin that some jerks put there to scare me. But I realized as I walked out of my house to pull it away... it wasn't there. I shrugged it off, thinking that someone had hidden it while I was walking through my door. But I went back in and looked out that same window, and it was looking in, staring at me. I walked around my house, yelling for whoever it was to come out, but no one was there.
The thing is hairless and naked, and it didn't look like it actually had eyes, or even a face at all. But its head is turned towards me when I enter the room. When I sit on my computer, I can feel its faceless hatred boring into my neck. But when I turn around, it's innocently turned in a different direction. 
Finally on Thursday I tried to open the window, but it's stuck. I think the thing's hands are keeping it down. But I got a good look at its face. Its eyes and mouth are behind the skin, pushing outward.
It stared at me, smiling.

Of course, I screamed.
I pulled back a fist and smashed it onto the glass, determined once and for all to get rid of the glaring monster. I know I’m strong enough. That glass should’ve cracked.
But it didn’t.
It shuddered under my hand, but it didn’t break. And that smile just got wider and wider and wider, until I thought its head would break in half. It raised its own hand and bashed the window with its palm. It was mocking me. But I saw the faintest crack begin to appear where it had hit, and I backed away. 
No way did I want that smile in the same room as me. 
So I got a roll of duct tape, and I started covering the window. I couldn’t look directly at it; I nearly shit my pants just knowing it was watching me. But I couldn’t help it. I took a quick glance at that skin-covered face. A small peek.
It was angry.
That menacing grin was now a gaping frown full of teeth. The skin had ripped away from its mouth and I could see down its cavernous throat. A menacing rumble started to fill the house, and that hairline crack began to spread like splintering ice. I pulled down the duct tape. The rumble stopped, the split skin healed over, and it began to smile again.
Now it’s night, and the noise hasn’t started again. There are no sounds, no rumble, no crackling glass. Everything’s quiet now.
But I can feel its claws gripping the back of my chair. I can hear its skin stretching as it smiles.
It’s watching me type.

18,"A dream, involving what I think was the SCP Foundation",1299048125,"I was at a banquet of sorts, a formal dinner. Maybe a wedding reception.  It had that kind of vibe.  However, I wasn't there for the same reason as everyone else.  I had this thought pulling at me, that ""I need to find it before they do.""

After a lot of fruitless searching, I sat down at a table.  A young girl approached me. I said, ""Hey, [name]."" (I knew her name in the dream, but I can't seem to recall it now)  I picked her up, sat her on my lap, and asked if she was enjoying the party.  She seemed disinterested, and doodled a small stick-figure on a napkin.  Then, she pointed at it, and it jumped off of the napkin. It moved around the table, and even swam in my drink.  Dumbfounded, I looked back at the girl, who was now making a spoon float above her hand. I jumped up, grabbed her by the hand, and said, ""Come on, [name], we need to get out of here.""

As I approached the door, several men in suits locked it in front of me.  A quick look around showed that all of the doors were now guarded by similar men.  I thought, ""No, I can't let them take her!""  One of the men stepped forward, grabbed the girl, and I woke up.

20,being watched while asleep,1299040680,"ok, a little backstory. I am a cadet at the Virginia Military Institute which is quite possibly the most haunted place I have ever been, no joke. All of the history and tradition make for an excellent breeding ground for spirits... but I'm not sure if a spirit-type is whats behind this. 

Around 3 AM about one week ago, I was sound asleep. Due to my work heavy major, I had only recently fallen asleep (around 1:45 AM). Well, my bed is neatly situated in our first floor 15ftx15ft four man room, very crowded yes. Where my bed is located also just so happens to be right next to the window which leads directly to a road that runs along side of our barracks. There are no screens on the windows, only a hitch-lock glass window and a couple of bars. A little after 3, I woke up fairly suddenly, it had all of a sudden gotten extremely cold, and knowing I had locked the windows like I always do, I couldnt imagine it coming from the outside air. I was wrong.. I opened my eyes only slightly and saw directly in front of my face the window cracked and a figure resembling a head quickly move away from the crack. My eyes opened wider, I couldnt move. Suddenly on the other part of the window still closed, there were 3 LOUD knocks, on the glass, very quickly, which shot me out of my bed. I froze, standing there panting. I looked around and one of my roommates was standing on the other side of the room staring at the window and another one of my roommates was balled up on his bed with his head perked up staring at me. I moved to the window, flung it open, and nothing. I could see up and down the street, which has about a 30 foot drop on one side, clearly for about 300 yards in either direction. 

The thing that scared me the most.. How long was someone watching me, within arms reach, while I slept. ",nosleep,Jkinster,/r/nosleep/comments/fvkcz/being_watched_while_asleep/
21,Doors,1299038388,"When I was in high school I lived in a two story house. It was pretty big so we mostly used the upstairs. The downstairs was mostly storage and/or in serious need of repair.  It also connected to the garage, which only locked from the inside.The garage had space for two cars parked in front of each other. One car was in the actual ""garage"" while the other car would be outside, underneath my bedroom, with a cement wall on one side and the house on the other.
The door that connected the garage to the downstairs did not have a lock. We also only locked our primary doors at night because it was a very safe neighborhood and there weren't enough keys for everyone. You also could not see any of the downstairs while you were upstairs. It was a very creepy set up.

I was never very comfortable in the house. I always had a feeling I was being watched. Even as a senior in high school if I was left home alone at night I would lock myself in my room.

One day I came home from school to find the front door wide open. We had just gotten a new door and it was significantly lighter than our old one, so I didn't think too much of it. I just called my mom to ask if anyone had left it that way and closed it. Worried that my dog may get out if the door continued to blow open, my mom made me a key on her way home and we decided to start locking the doors.

A few days later, I come home and the garage door is open. The door that you would drive your car through. I figured someone got locked out and forgot to close it, so I closed it and went upstairs. 

I had been home maybe ten minutes when my mom called me and asked me to take the dog out. Apparently she had had a meeting and hadn't been home today during her lunch to let him out. So I did it, went back inside and started watching T.V.

I'm the last person to leave my house in the morning. I waited by the closed garage door to stay out out the wind. If no one had been home to let the dog out, then no one had been home to get locked out and subsequently open the garage. All of this occurs to me, and I get really really freaked out and uncomfortable. About forty-five minutes later, my step-dad comes home. So I ask him if he's been home today. 

When he tells me no, I tell him about the garage door being open, he decides to check out the downstairs with a bat. He comes back telling me that nothing seemed out of place, but that the door to the garage was open.

This is terrifying for two reasons. One, we always keep the door shut because my stepdad is terrified of rodents finding their way into the house. And two, because I had come in through that door after shutting the garage. I closed it firmly behind me.

A few other scary things happened near/in that house as well.

It was around the time I had just started to talk, my mother was home alone taking care of me as my dad was on the night shift at the local barracks (he was an army private at the time)

It was around 10pm when my mother was settling me into my cot after we both fell asleep watching TV downstairs. As she was picking me up to lay me down in the bed, I was apparetnly wide awake, looking slightly over my mother's shoulder

""Mom? Who's that?"", I asked sleepily.  
""Who's who, love?""

I was quite awake now, pointedly looking at something over her shoulder.   

""Who's that lady in the hall?""

24,The Man Under the Stairs,1299028982,"   During the summer of 2010, my friends would visit alot. We have an old town and most of the houses don't have air conditioning so it's always nice to ""chill out"" here. One day in the summer I expirienced something I will never forget.

   
 
  Me and a friend were hanging out and it was getting late and he had to work the next morning, so he decided to leave at around 10:30. I used the restroom as he was leaving, so when I came out he was gone. I finished my business and came out and my house was empty, so I sat down and watched tv. My living room is connected to my kitchen, and as I was sitting in the living room, I noticed something in the corner of my eye. A dark figure walk down the hall, through my kitchen. I suspected it was my friend, and maybe he forgot something (my friends tend to just barge in if the doors are unlocked) so I got up to see what he wanted.


   I turned down the hall that the figure entered and saw nothing. This hallway leads to my basement, and I thought it was weird that my friend would go downstiars alone. I called his name and no answer, so I assumed I was seeing things. I sat back down in the living room and finished watching TV.



  About half an hour later I was getting thirsty, so I went to grab a pepsi from my beer fridge in the basement. I'm used to going down in my basement with the lights off and quickly grabbing a drink then running like hell back up the stairs. The stair design was the kind that have no front face, so theres a space in between each stair. 

       

   As I was going upstairs in the dark ass basement with my pepsi in hand, I opened my slide phone to turn on the light of my cell phone.   As I shined the light through the stairs, I noticed a figure standing under the stairs, staring at me through the gaps. It was STARING at me.





   I froze. I just stared at this thing. It was a gray figure with glossy eyes and a dark, dark beard. I thought it was the weirdest, creepiest thing I've ever seen. Obviousley, I hauled ass up those stairs and closed the door to the basement with a definate slam. None my friends have beards, and I was definately home alone.



  The next morning I ventured downstairs to see if there was a possible explanation for what i saw the previous night. Nothing. Some of my dad's old golf clubs, but thats it. I never told anyone about it, cause they'd call me a fucking psycho, but now I turn on the light when I go downstairs, and get my ass out of there as fast as I can everytime I grab a pepsi.

25,The deamon. ,1299027306,"A few years ago when I was a junior in high school, I was getting ready for school in the morning. I grabbed a bowl, my favorite cereal and of course, some milk. I sat down and started reading the cereal box as I always do. My parents were gone for some reason so I had to wait for a ride since I didn't yet have a car. Then, after finishing my breakfast, I got a call from my parents telling me to be ready to go since it was getting late. A few minutes went by and I hear my front door open. It was my parents asking me why I had gone outside and into the alley that leads to the fence of our backyard. I was confused. My mom explained how they had seen me walk out the door, past their car pulling into the driveway, and headed straight into the alley. She also explained how it had to have been me since the person she saw was wearing the exact same thing I was. 
I didn't even know what to say. I had heard of demons taking the shape of humans to appeal to people before, but I never thought it was actually real. 
After that, things got a little weird. Whenever family came over, they would comment on how they felt uncomfortable at home and they felt watched.

Now, when I moved in, the pool was no longer there because after the boy drowned they filled it with dirt or something. Well, my uncle used to be the maintenance man at the apartments when that happened and it was him who went in to take the boy out of the pool so after we moved in, he would tell us stories of how the boy was seen wondering around at the park. (the pool area was converted into a park after the incident). Being little kids, we would believe his every word and we would be scared for days. 
The only thing I remember, is sometimes being able to hear footsteps on the ground if we were at the park late at night or see a swing move even on a windless night. 

A few years later, when I was in 7th grade my parents and my little brother went to church one evening. I stayed home with my older brother and watched him play Zelda. Now, the layout of the room is kind of important to the story so you guys can understand. The bed was on the back wall and the tv was facing the back wall also, so when you watched tv, you could also see the hallway from where you were. So on that particular day, my brother decided to leave the door open. (Usually, the door to the room would be closed for privacy, I guess). My eyes were fixed on the tv and as always, I could also see part of the hallway from where I sat but I wasn't paying much attention to it until I saw something moving around through the door way. At first, it was out of the corner of my eye and it wasn't so clear, but after seeing it move closer towards the doorway, I had to look. We were alone, yet there was a man peeking at me through the doorway. I could only see half of his face because he was hiding. He was short and had spikey hair but the weirdest thing about it all was that he was see-through but he still had somewhat of a peach color to his face. He didn't do anything for about a minute. He stood there looking at me like we were playing some sort of staring game. I don't know how, but I kept starig back. It was almost like he had me under some sort of spell. Nothing changed in his expression until...he smiled. His smile exposed jagged teeth that looked as if he had them filed down in that precise manner. I had never in my life gotten chills from seing someone smile, but this man wasn't smiling in a friendly way. It was an almost demonic smile. He stood there for what seemed like an eternity and although I was afraid, I couldn't stop staring. Finally, I was free and I quickly buried my head into the blanket. My brother was both startled and confused so he asked me what the hell I was doing and I told him what I had seen. He didn't believe me, but we both set out to check the locks on the doors to make sure it wasn't some creep that had wondered into the apartment.
We found nothing...

In the same year and about the 2 that followed, a bunch of weird and scary things happened. I will post more stories about them if anyone is interested, so please let me know.       ",nosleep,MelissaMacabre,/r/nosleep/comments/fvcpw/the_apartments/
28,Cursed,1299013680,"A discussion in the ""Closet/Need Help"" update thread reminded me of a nosleep-worthy experience I had when I was in college. I was taking a religion class (credit requirement, so I picked the one about paganism), and the professor had a woman come in who claimed she could ""read auras"", do spiritual cleansings, etc. I was, and still am, a big skeptic when it comes to the supernatural (though this doesn't stop me from enjoying this sub-Reddit), so I thought little of it when she picked me out of the group of maybe 15 students to read my aura. I sat on a chair in the middle of the classroom while she moved her hands over my head, arms and chest. She didn't touch me, instead skimming her hands about an inch away. 

Her eyes had been closed when she was doing this, and when she stopped, she opened them and asked me if I knew anyone in my past who would have wished harm on me. I thought about it for a moment and told her I couldn't think of anyone. She looked troubled and asked me if I remembered a girl with jet-black hair from when I was a teenager. Again, I thought about it, and this time, someone did come to mind- a girl I was sort of friends with growing up. We were the same grade in school, and our families sometimes had dinner together at one house or the other. The girl (let's call her C) lived on an old farm, and her house was supposedly haunted. Everyone in her family- mother, father, two brothers- all claimed to have had run-ins with an assortment of ghosts, ranging from whimsical to almost demonic entities. 

C had told me about her room smelled overpoweringly of rotting flesh, seeing apparitions around the property, cold spots, levitating objects, and similar phenomenon. I loved the stories, and though I never experienced anything myself at her house, I always felt a level of dread whenever we visited, and I never wanted to be in any room of the house by myself, even as a somewhat skeptical teen. In any case, C *also* told me that she had tried spells and witchcraft to get the ghosts to leave on many occasions, and when the healer asked me about a girl with black hair, my throat turned to sandpaper. I nodded that I did remember her, and her face became grave. She explained to me that while reading my aura, she had had mental flashes of a girl with black hair performing spells in the woods. She leaned in closer so the rest of the class couldn't hear exactly what she said, and told me that I had been cursed by the girl (C) and that they had been blood rituals. 

As skeptical as I am, the look on her face and the fact that she had ""seen"" C doing spells made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. She asked me if I could remember any life changes during that time, and I nodded. During junior high, I became very anxious and lost a good amount of weight. That stress never really went away, becoming a shadow that followed me wherever I went. I wondered how much of it could have been because of something C did intentionally or unintentionally on some crisp fall afternoon out in the woods.

Apprehensively, I asked the healer if she could get rid of the curse. She looked pained and said she couldn't. She suggested that I get a smudge stick and healing kit and try it on myself, and I got the feeling that it was less that she couldn't heal me but rather that she was afraid of whatever it was that C had sent after me. I did as she instructed, and did a salt scrub for good measure, but years later I still wonder, how deep did that blood stain?",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fvax3/cursed/
29,This is why I hate open doors.,1299008952,"Okay, so this happened to me just a few days ago, it was this event that persuaded me to join reddit and post on r/nosleep, as I finally had a reason to after many weeks of lurking.

I came home from University after my lectures; nothing seemed out of ordinary about the house, I just went straight upstairs to my bedroom after grabbing something to eat. I’m quite behind on my work at the moment, so I sit down at my desk, plug my earphones in and start to work, keep in mind I keep my music very quiet so I can hear what is going on around me (paranoia from reading this subreddit too much, I think…)

Now, the layout of my room is quite important to this story, as my desk is positioned against the side of the room with me facing the wall. My bedroom door is directly to my left, and I mean directly, if I reach my hand out just slightly I can touch it. If I look out my door I can see the top of the stairs, the bathroom door to my left, and the corridor to my right which leads on to two bedrooms, one of which being my boyfriends.

Usually when I work I make sure my door is shut, so as to not be distracted by people walking by or just general house-noise. But that day I left it open to allow for some air circulation, now I’m beginning to regret this decision. 

As I was working, I hear someone walk up the stairs over the music of my earphones, thinking nothing of it I carry on working. Out of the corner of my eye one I saw my boyfriend walk past towards his bedroom, he didn’t say anything. Thinking it was weird he didn’t say anything; I took my earphones out and shouted out ‘Hey’. There was no response from him, but I could hear things being shuffled and moved around in his bedroom. Thinking he may have just had a bad day at University, I left him alone. About 5 minutes pass and the shuffling and general movement stops, and I see my boyfriend again, out the corner of my eye, move past my door and into the bathroom, the door shuts.

Approximately 15 minutes after this, with me not hearing anything during this time, my boyfriend walks up the stairs and comes into my room, says ‘hello’, kisses my forehead and starts to leave. Confused as to how he got out the bathroom and down the stairs without me seeing or hearing, I ask him what was wrong earlier and where he had been. It was after I saw the puzzled expression on his face that I glanced down and noticed he had his Uni bag, coat and shoes on, he had only just arrived at the house. The jolt of shock mixed with fear that shot through me that moment I have rarely felt. I got up straight away to check the bathroom, opened the door, nothing there.

I live with three other students, my boyfriend not included; none of them were in the house when this happened, and none had been in the house since that morning. And now I think about it, and the more I think about it, that figure I saw didn’t really look like a normal person at all.

31,Lake of Sorrows,1299008236,"On the west coast of Canada there is a lake nestled in some foot hills and surrounded by lush rainforest. It's called Lake Sorrento but the locals call it the Lake of Sorrows. It earned that nickname because every summer at least one person drowns in it and some summers as many as 3 people drown.

Now that may not seem like an unreasonably high number of drownings but there are several things that make it an unusual occurrence. First, is that the lake is fairly secluded, there are no roads leading to it, only a few hiking trails. It's not like its a local hotspot or anything. Over the course of the summer probably only a couple dozen people ever visit this lake in the first place.

Now even with so few visitors to the lake a drowning wouldn't be unheard of except for there are signs all around the perimeter of the lake warning people not to swim.  The reason, which is clearly depicted on the signs in both words and pictures is that the lake bottom is covered in long tentacle like weeds. These weeds reach up from the bottom of the lake and almost breach the surface. As you can imagine it is real easy for a swimmer to get tangled up in these thick weeds. Anyone that gets caught in these weeds exhaust themselves trying to break free and drown.

So why then, with all the warning signs and stories of yearly drownings, do people still tempt fate by swimming in this lake? The answer to that is as bizarre as the lake itself. The locals call it the 'allure of the lake'. You hear it talked about over campfire ghost stories, and whispered by the townsfolk anytime there is news of another drowning. It's something I really didn't believe until I experienced it myself.

As a teenager me and my friend had heard all the stories about the Lake of Sorrows and decided to trek out there one day to check it out for ourselves. We parked just off the Sea to Sky highway and hiked a trail deep into the forest. It took us a few hours but the path was well marked and we soon found our selves at the lake. I remember seeing one of the lake's many warning signs and how the picture on it creeped me out. It depicted a clearly distressed swimmer with a long vine like weed wrapped around one of his legs. 

What creeped me out the most was that I imagined everyone that had drowned in that lake must have seen this very sign or one of the many like it dotting the perimeter... What were the last thoughts of all those that drown this way? ""Damn, I should have listened to the sign, it predicted this would happen!"" Even in the hot humid summer I had the chills just thinking about it.

The lake wasn't very big and there was a trail leading all the way around it. By the size of the lake we figured it would only take about a half hour to walk all the way around so that's what we did.

I'm not sure how it happened but at some point I found myself alone on the lake shore skipping stones into the lake. That was when something inexplicable happened. I suddenly felt an urgent desire to jump into the lake. At first I was able to resist but I wasn't able to pull myself away from the lake shore. The longer I stood there the stronger the urge became. Before I could even stop myself I was in up to my knees.  I remember feeling terrified of what was happening, it was so surreal. It felt like I needed to jump in the lake like I needed my next breath. You know what it feels like when you have been holding your breath for a long time and your brain is just demanding that you take that next breath? That's kind of what this felt like. My brain was demanding that I jump in the lake. It took everything in me to fight the urges driving me forward. As the water breached my waist I realized it was a battle I was quickly losing.

The water was almost up to my chest when I heard my friend calling my name. I looked back and my friend was just standing there wondering what the fuck I was doing.  I couldn't call out to him for help, it was taking all my concentration just to stop myself from jumping into the lake.

He must have seen the distressed look on my face and knew something was wrong. He ran towards me and grabbed my arm and yanked me back away from the lake. I remember falling back onto the beach area and immediately the urge to enter the lake left me. At that point all I wanted was to get as far away from this lake as possible and never come back. I just looked at my friend and said ""Let's get the fuck out of here."" He shared my sentiments wholly.

33,How to Obtain Holy Water For Personal Use: a simple guide for non-Catholics.,1299005176,"In light of recent stories submitted, and since everything posted here is true, AND since many people have recommended holy water (along with sage smudging and salt) to those who have asked forhad vice, I thought it might be helpful to explain how anyone may acquire some bonafide holy water to take home and keep at hand, or use, if the situation seems to call for it.

I am a Cafeteria Catholic, which means I follow the doctrines, edicts, and believes I personally find true, and outright disregard any I disagree with. Contrary to outsider belief, it is not black and white, all or nothing, Catholic or non-Catholic, at least according to my ""reform"" beliefs. But this is not a theological discussion. With that in mind, please leave my views alone, especially since I am writing this out as a favor.

1) though you can buy all kinds of fancy bottles of glass or even crystal online, you may use a simple plain plastic bottle to hold your holy water. Now, you don't need much at all. To make it easy, I will suggest one of those TSA-approved bottles from the drugstore. The plain empty ones, not an smothers out bottle of Pantene. This is one time when recycling is discouraged.

2) Go to your nearest Catholic church. If you have several to choose from, lookup the saints they are Ahmed for and find out what they are the patron saints of.  You may find you relate to one in particular. We have patron saints for everything, from sore throats to mechanics. Google it.

3) At the front of the church you will usually find a large font filled with holy water. If there's no large font, or if you enter from a side door, look for smaller bowls or fonts directly by the door.

4) First dip your fingers in the water and make a sign of the cross on yourself, forehead, head, left shoulder, right shoulder.

5) Now dip your bottle in the font and take as much as you wish, or fill the whole thing. Seal tightly, say a prayers of thanks.

6) Not time to hightail out yet. Go sit down in a pew, first genuflecting towards the altar before entreating the pew. Either sit, or kneel on the handy fold-out kneeler. You can pray, or simply let your mind wander over your problems. Think about the peace you would like in your life and the strength, patience, or hope you need to attain your goals. Guess what, that's praying! Simple, isn't it? Almost like concentrated thinking, which is what we all do when faced with a tricky problem.

5) There is no rule disxtating how long you must stay. Just sit or kneel quietly and leave when you feel ready. Genuflect again on your way out of the pew.

6) As you pass the font on your way out, repeat the process of dipping your hand and making the sign of the cross.

7) You now have your very own sacred holy water!

As for how to use it, that's another post, or independent study. But see, it's not difficult yo get, and if you are shy, luckily you can obtain it privately without having to ask anyone for help!

34,Floorboards,1299002541,"Little history, feel free to skip to the TLDR. I live in a house that is over 150 years old, it was the second building to be built in the town I live in. Before we bought it, it sat abandoned for three years. Needless to say it needs some work.

Every attempt made to buy it fell through for some reason. My wife and I made three attempts to buy it, even moving in and working on it with the banks permission before the sale had gone through. But something happened every time. Eventually the bank was fed up and was going to auction it off. Our real estate agent convinced them that we had worked very hard on it, and were willing to offer more than what they'd probably get at auction, so we got it fairly cheap. Had to take out some loans, hit family up for money, but we own it outright now.

Upon occasion I have seen things out of the corner of my eye. People in windows while I am outside. Shadowy animals when none of ours are inside, nothing major. I have also heard my wife call me once or twice when she hasn't, and our friend who is living her currently heard a little girl giggle. But what is going on today is bothering me the most.

My mother always wondered why no one would ever choose to just sleep on the couch some night or want to be in the living room alone late at night. One night she found out when she fell asleep on the couch. She was awakened sometime after midnight by hearing someone choking and coughing - trying desperately to breath. Of course being worried she got up and wandered around seeing if everyone was okay and after checking each room and finding us all asleep, she stopped into my sisters' room and found you could hear the choking even from there but it seemed to be coming from the room she awoke in. After that she never again asked why neither girl wanted to be home at night - one would work a night job and the other would beg to stay at some friend's house any day she could.

",1298993103,"Tales of Ragged Lake pt.4: A Conversation with Ben

As any of you who have been following my storyline from the beginning know, I have a younger brother named Ben. The back story to this Instant Messenger conversation is that I posted a link to what I wrote for y'all in Facebook, Ben read it, and got in touch with me. Please note, these are not our actual IM names, so don't try to contact either of us.

**Ben:** Yo bro.

**VT:** hey

**Ben:** I read your horror stories about Ragged Lake last night. I'd all but forgotten about the night the bear attacked you in the outhouse! Had me laughin my ass off recollecting.

**VT:** glad i could amuse you    
**VT:** it wasn't a bear tho

**Ben:** Sorry, the boogeyman.    
**Ben:** I liked the second story more.    
**Ben:** I assume the hand was supposed to be Mr. MacGregor's?

**VT:** who?

**Ben:** Macgregor    
**Ben:** Lived three camps down    
**Ben:** Had the enormous dog we thought was a bear    
**Ben:** Otto.

**VT:** oh yeah    
**VT:** wait he's dead?    
**VT:** the guy i mean, not the dog

**Ben:** Well yeah.

**VT:** he drowned?

**Ben:** He went ice fishing and fell through the ice. So, uh, yes. Drowned.

**VT:** when did this happen?

**Ben:** Bluh, I don't remember. YEARS ago. I remember because nobody knew he was missing until Spring when he bobbed up and scared some canoers.

**VT:** jesus    
**VT:** hang on, phone

**Ben:** That'd make a good story.    
**Ben:** lala la la lala

**VT:** this was before my senior year of college?

**Ben:** Definitely before you graduated. I remember Dad telling me the day before Thanksgiving your senior year that he was discovered the previous Spring.    
**Ben:** Mom had the turkey thawing in the bathtub and I referred to it as Mr. MacGregor.

**VT:** nobody told me

**Ben:** Well, you didn't like to hear news about Ragged Lake, so Dad made an effort to not mention shit like that.

**VT:** any other bombshells you wanna drop on me?

**Ben:** You're a douchebag?

**VT:** already knew that one    
**VT:** bedwetter

**Ben:** :(    
**Ben:** Here's one you can write about... old lady hung herself in her cabin in 2002.    
**Ben:** Her grand daughter found her.    
**Ben:** Like the whole family was on a trip and they had rented the cabin

**VT:** wtf    
**VT:** i didtn see a report of that in the blotters    
**VT:** didnt

**Ben:** Well, it could be a rumor, I guess. Dad told me about it, so I figured it must be true.    
**Ben:** Why lie about something bizarre like that?

**VT:** its possible its true. i'd have to verify it.

**Ben:** You should go up there with a tape recorder and spend the night and just record the whole experience.    
**Ben:** Or

**VT:** fuck that

**Ben:** Or being a camera crew and interview the outhouse boogeyman

**VT:** you cant tell me youve never seen or heard anything even remotely strange there    
**VT:** what about the thing you saw in the trees

**Ben:** You're going to have to be a bit less vague there, bro.

**VT:** i remember when you were 8 you were in the bottom bunk    
**VT:** and kept peeking out the window shades and crying    
**VT:** you said there was a man with arms like snakes up in the trees

**Ben:** I think the difference here is that I grew up and I stopped believing there were monkey-armed mutants watching me from the treetops.

**VT:** seeing things at night in the dark is one thing    
**VT:** you saw the outhouse door the next day    
**VT:** smashed INWARD    
**VT:** i didn't do that

**Ben:** I'm not trying to dispute that you saw something. I just think you should consider something a bit more plausible than ""MONSTER!""    
**Ben:** It just seems

**VT:** it was in the bunk room with you

**Ben:** Or that was me peeking through the knothole inside, and a bear peeking into the outhouse.    
**Ben:** Or a pervert.    
**Ben:** Maybe it was Mr. Macgregor again

**VT:** :-/    
**VT:** im posting this to the forum

**Ben:** Tell them I said ""BOO"".

I'm posting this log because of the mention of the guy drowning while ice fishing and the old lady hanging herself. Two more deaths (maybe one) directly related to the lake. I didn't see anything about a hanging in the blotters this past weekend, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I was speed reading because of the sheer amount of things to go through and the time crunch of getting it all done and back home in time for work.

38,Update: Closet / need help,1298989930,"[Original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fublo/i_dont_know_what_to_doneed_help/)

Ok, so I tried following some of the advice people posted here:

* Tried apologizing...but I felt pretty dumb but did it.
* I got holy water and lavendar and sprayed the closet...hell, I even Febreezed it.
* Couldn't find sage brush or cedar logs...so I didn't burn any of these.
* Left a line of salt in front of the door
* Didn't want to set up a camera...I didn't have anything that would go all night or that could shoot in low light.  I also didn't want to piss it off more.
* Same with the latch - I considered adding one but again, I thought it might just make things worse.

What happened last night:

It was hard as hell but I decided to sleep in my bedroom.  When I first entered the bedroom to do all the things above, the room was really cold.  However, this wasn't TOO surprising as I did leave the door closed for a week so the room hasn't had circulating air.  The closet door was wide open...I knew it would be.  I checked the door to make sure it wouldn't open by itself (it doesn't) and it definitely closes properly.  I sprayed the closet, put the salt down...apologized...and then tried to watch a movie to take my mind off it.

I fell asleep in the bed with the TV on.  I was laying on my side, sorta facing away from the closet (technically perpendicular to it but I couldn't see it directly where I was).  I heard the closet open...it wasn't loud but I heard the knob twist and the door creak slightly.  I was instantly awake but kept my eyes shut...I was terrified.  This was the first time I've been awake when the door actually opened.

I couldn't move...or more like I couldn't bring myself to move.  I just thought if I stayed still long enough it would just go away...after several minutes...the feeling just wouldn't go.  It was just dread...somehow...I don't know...I just knew this was bad.  Suddenly...it got even colder in the room.  My teeth were literally chattering.  I just kept as still as I could...I didn't open my eyes.  Then I felt breath...it was like someone was breathing...inches from my face.  I felt the air move over my cheek and ear...I could hear it go in and out.  There was no smell and the air wasn't warm.  This continued for a minute or two...and then I felt it leave.  

It seemed to leave really quickly...the feeling of dread was gone and I actually felt a lot better.  Of course, I still got my shit and slept the rest of the night on the couch.

Now that it is morning...I'm feeling a lot better.  I think I'm going to do this again tonight...but I'll bring myself to confront it tonight.  I'm going to have to get up and yell at it or something.  Maybe try to spray it with the water...I don't know...something physical.  It is definitely bad - evil - whatever but if it could hurt me, I think it would have last night.  I'm tired of being scared in my own home like a child.  What do you all think?  Any other suggestions? 

To answer other questions:

* There is no attic access or anything like that in the closet.  I'm on a crawl space but again, no access or storage areas from within the closet.
* My username...yeah...I don't know...it just popped into my head.

**EDIT:** I didn't even think to check to see if the woman I was with did anything in my bathroom since all the activity was from the closet.  I checked one of the drawers I never use...and...

[I found this](http://imgur.com/JuJWa)

It looks to me like some hair from my brush...the rest...I have no idea.  It is sorta bound together (you can't really tell from this I guess...it is quite loose).  There's other particles of something nasty (I assume it is shit)...and some white stuff.  It smells really bad and is a little wet...after all this time I have no idea how.  This definitely isn't from me and it isn't an animal or something...wtf?

39,A night I will never forget,1298974037,"Hey nosleep, it's 5 am so I figured I'd share one of mine instead of lurking for once.

Alright, so it was a saturday night and my parents were away for the weekend so naturally I felt it was a good night to get trashed and stumble home. Friends were still out and the call I was expecting at 9:30 had yet to come. Whatever, either they forgot, were busy, or I was just suppose to show up. Anyways, I was killing time watching videos on youtube and somehow I ended up watching one that talked about the illumanti etc. Now I'm by no means a superstitious person, but I do enjoy listening to all the crazy theories and stories people have to tell. Now this is where the shit that will scar me for life happened. I'll put the link to the video at the end so you get an idea of what might be going through my head.

The subject was the song umbrella by Rihanna, and some weird imagery in the song. As I'm watching, it shows how her body sort of creates the face of a demon(hard to explain), and right as it zooms in to give you a closer look, the power for the whole neighbourhood dies. I almost shit my pants. I'm home alone in a huge fucking house with no lightsource and my heart is about to explode. I just huddled in a corner with tears in my eyes begging for the power to come back. Probably the most agonizing 10 minutes I've ever experienced because it just felt like forever.

40,walking doll (by request),1298960674,"Originally a comment, this is the story of something in my parents old house. My sister ""K"" is 10 years older than me. When she was about 5, she had a little blonde doll with a blue dress. At first she loved the doll but after a while she would just throw the thing in the closet. Eventually my dad questioned her about this and she replied,""I gotta lock her in the closet or she will walk around at night."" My dad and i have both seen a little blonde girl in a blue dress out of the corner of our eye at night. I can even remember us both seeing her at the same time one night while watching tv. Never bothered us, just wondered around. Another strange thing: my bedroom was right next to the bathroom. My mom was always crashing into stuff in the dark when she got up to pee in the middle of the night. I would hear everything; she'd get up run into the door, lean against the wall of the hallway, hit the lightswitch, close the door, and pee. One night I heard he familiar noise... the door, the scratching sound of a body skimming against a wall, lightswitch and door. Hearing this I opened my door to tell her something but there was nothing. The lights were off and bathroom door was open. Freaked me out. Another time, my parents came home and heard someone rifling through shit in my room. They went in to say hello to me and found the room empty with all my clothes pulled out of my dresser. No one was home, windows and doors locked. They called me all spooked and asked if I was just there. Theres other shit too but that stands out right now.

41,Someone is watching me.,1298959745,"Background. This has been happening since I was about 8 years old. 
I never watched scary movies as a child. Whether it was just an over-active imagination, i'll never know, but as I got older i believed it was something I would just grow out of. I always felt like there was someone watching me. From a very young age, I slept with a nightlight, and still do when I return to my parents house(i'm at college). I just can't stay in the dark. But it's not a fear of the dark per se, it's a fear of what's in the dark. Call it the unknown or whatever, but it freaks me out. Sometimes i'm not able to sleep. I see things, I hear things, and my dreams(however infrequent, thank goodness), put me on edge. I feel like I'm trapped when i'm laying in my bed, afraid to look to my closet or underneath my bed. Or even to look in the middle of the room, waiting for something to be there. I always thought i'd outgrow it.

The thing is, I haven't. Even though i sleep with a roommate in my room in my dorm, i can't face towards the wall(my bed is against the wall) because I don't want to turn my back on whatever could be there.

The reason i'm submitting this is because i was wondering if this has ever happened to anyone else. I'm ruling out paranoia and over-active imagination, because i've already thought about those and accepted them, and yet i still have this fear. i'm just looking for people like me, and maybe another explanation.",nosleep,gttaluvredditors,/r/nosleep/comments/fuvf3/someone_is_watching_me/
42,Need dream interpretation help.,1298956505,"Straight to the point: 
ever since I was little, I have had intense dreams about houses. The dreams are usually about a different house every time, but the theme of it being a beautiful, large house with lots of secret passage ways, hidden wings, and even crawl spaces that lead to 3rd and 4th stories is always the same. They are never scary, although the feeling is always an ominous and curious one. Sometimes I'll even find entire families secretly living in hidden places. 
The locations vary, but they are mostly on the water somehow, and one prominent house is on top of a hill with a giant orange tree outside.

I need help understanding what these might mean. I have even considered going to a psychic or something because I really want to know, and all my research has hit a dead end.

44,My experiences with the paranormal.,1298943032,"Since I was little I used to see ghosts, not see through ones, just solid like normal people look but they don't breath and look out of place with pale faces sometimes.



I see orbs like bright flight balls of light moving around or flashes of light in the night. 




First thing I remember is walking in the market where I live when I was very small with my mom and seeing an arab man in chains, cloth over his middle and a turban on his head but naked apart from that, it was really cold too and he kept staring at me really wide eyed and glary until i was right next to him... so I told mom and made her walk back with me and he was gone.




I also walked back from the shops once and saw a boy in a wicker wheel chair with a blanket over his lap looking through me, there were people chatting next to him but they had not seen him, I looked down for a second and then back and he had gone.




The most scariest one was in my bedroom... I walked into my room, I was 11 years old at the time.. and got into bed, the light was on in the hallway 'cos I couldn't sleep without it on.




 I turned round and there was a man in my room sitting at my desk looking into the tv without any reflection at all and he wasn't moving, I decided to look away and then back because they usually dissapear, but he didn't.... no matter what i did he was  still there. I just put the covers over my head and stayed there till I fell to sleep because I was scared to run out the room.




Once in my garden I saw a bright light come from under the tree at the end of my garden, then suddenly it was a huge football sized white ball of light zoomed out from under it and went straight through the wooden fence and vanished.




I took a photo once when I was young from outside of my house looking in and could see the t.v from outside... there was a face peering out with hands pressed up against it, it was the same man I saw in my bedroom..




I decieded to go to a medium spiritualist church to get some training and to see if I could do messages, but I don't trust mediums very much and it's hard to trust someone who you have to pay.




In the sessions we did a psychic test where I had to use my sences to tell what the other person had done through the week, we didn't know who we were partnered with so that made it harder... I got it right first time.




I did a message through the open circle and got that right too but it drained me so much I had to go to bed. Here is the message... I saw a man called Jacob and he was wearing a sargiant's clothing, it was black, he had a sword he was showing me and I got a few numbers too... one woman replied "" those are the numbers of my phone number, Jacob was my husband and he was in black watch as a sargiant, the sword was what he killed himself with...""




I still do not believe much of what happend, it still goes on but I have not seen orbs for a while but have seen my dead gran recently.
I would not believe in ghosts if I didn't have these experiences.




Just to say, I am not a medium and I do not trust myself enough to do such work even if I get it right I feel a bit uncomfertable incase I get it wrong.

46,The Cabin - Day 3,1298937121,"How it all began:    
[Day 1](http://redd.it/frcw6)    
[Day 2](http://redd.it/fs50p)    

Whatever was terrorizing me left me alone for the rest of the night. I managed to get a full night’s sleep, though I wondered how long this would last. With three days left until my family headed back home, I had only so few options. Either I could suck it up and just try to get through the week, ignoring whatever was happening, or I could get to the bottom of things and try to get an answer. Being a naturally curious kid, this unfortunately meant getting to the bottom of things. I also wasn’t sure that this thing wouldn’t simply follow me home and torment me there. With only three days, I didn’t have a whole lot of time.

When I got out of bed, the rest of the family was already out and about. Dad and Opa had already gone to 100 Mile House to run some errands and get some supplies. My oldest cousin took the ATV into the woods to do some 4x4’ing. I felt safe as long as I wasn’t alone, making sure to keep everybody in view at all times. I was hoping I could take this day and relax, maybe play some Mario or something (I always brought the NES on extended trips like this one). Just as I was about to indulge in such luxuries, my little cousin comes to me and tells me we’re going to the store. Of course I tried to get out of it, but my Mom dragged me. ‘The walk will be good for you’ excuse. I caved.

The walk to the store is a good half-hour hike from the cabin. With forest on either side of the main road, it could easily make the walk much longer. At least I wasn’t alone. My Oma and sister stayed back at the cabin, so it was just my Mom, Aunt, cousin and myself. About halfway to the store, I got this feeling of dread. By now, I was used to expecting something horrible right away. I didn’t see any dark figure this time, but I heard noises in the forest. It was the same noise I heard while fishing with my Dad. The only description I can give is that it sounded like warped moans, very low toned. I kept myself aware of my surroundings, but never lost sight of anybody. Whatever was in the woods making those sounds was trying to draw my focus away; to trap me, in a sense. While I felt safe with people around me, I felt so alone. Nobody else could hear what I was hearing, or see what I was seeing. The weight of this was bearing down on me.

We got to the store, the sounds I was hearing finally going away. My cousin and I went to check out the man-made spawning stream that was set up for the lake trout, while my Mom and Aunt went to talk to the store owner. The stream is nothing too exciting, but it’s always a neat sight to see trout make their way up to lay their eggs.
It was bone dry. Being a kid, I didn’t know what to make of it, so I went to the top of the stream where the water starts (the stream is pump driven). The water comes out of a huge pipe, maybe two feet wide, which is drawn from the lake. It didn’t look clogged at all…it was just dried up. I took my cousin with me to the store, since the owner also maintains the stream. She said that it’s been dried up for the last couple days, ever since the storm came through. The dots were all connecting now. The fish, the dark figure, the dried stream. If there was an answer to all the horseshit that was tormenting me, it was at the stream. A sudden gust of wind blew the door open, scattering paper and knocking some display stands over. Everybody else laughed it off except me. My mom bought me a couple candy bars, so I was happy again, and off we went back to the cabin.

I wish I could say that making some sort of connection with what was going on made me feel better. I still wish that was true. The candy bars didn’t last long either. About halfway to the cabin, the sounds came back. I maintained my focus. Whatever it was, I was determined to not let it win. The sounds persisted. That’s when I heard my older cousin start screaming. I remembered he had taken the ATV into the woods, so I thought maybe he had an accident. He screamed again, in pain almost. I looked into the woods. That was my mistake.

As soon as I realized what happened, I just stood there. I wasn’t even afraid anymore. I knew that figure was there again, stalking me, looking at me with those cold white eyes. At this point I was getting tired of this shit. I was angry that my vacation was being ruined by something that wasn’t even my fault. I cried. I screamed. I let everything out. After turning around…everything changed.

I could see my family in the distance on the road, walking towards the cabin. They weren’t moving though, just walking in place. Running towards them was pointless, I wasn’t moving either. No matter how hard I moved my legs and felt like I was sprinting, no movement. This time I needed to confront whatever was there. I turned again to face it.

It wasn’t alone. There were three, maybe four, all bunched together in the distance. I stood my ground, watching as they seemed to get closer with every blink. It wasn’t long before I could see those eyes again. I thought one of them was bad enough. As they got closer, they started spreading out, surrounding me. There wasn’t just three or four like I thought. It was almost as if they were all coming from the same entity, copying itself over and over. They formed a circle all around me. I screamed as hard and as loud as I could, crouching to the ground. Two of them grabbed my arms and held me up. I kept my eyes closed and cried. I wanted it to be over, but they persisted. One of them put its hand on my chest. I could feel what I thought were claws, dragging down my chest. I remember it wasn’t a hard, deep clawing though. It was more like a light scratch, just enough to cause pain.

I finally opened my eyes. They were gone. I looked at my chest and saw nothing. No claw marks at all. I started crying again. I had to tell somebody what was going on. When I got to me feet and turned around, I saw family up ahead and ran towards them. This time my mom knew something was bothering me, especially when she saw me with tears rolling down my face. My cousin got scared when I told them everything that was going on. Being adults, my Mom and Aunt didn’t believe me and tried to assure me everything would be ok. I wanted to believe them.

We finally got to the cabin, just as my Dad and Opa were getting back. I ran to my dad for comfort, telling him everything. The rest of my family was worried about me, naturally, so they all tried to comfort me and take my mind off things. It was a couple hours before I started to finally calm down, almost late afternoon. My Aunt and Uncle were looking more worried than my parents.

My older cousin hadn’t come back.

49,Sometimes sleep is the only way to escape...,1298928545,"Sleep deprivation can cause some drastic changes to what you perceive.



I went to a private college from 2002 to 2006. Before it was converted into college the main building was a church and convent. (For you non-catholics out there a convent is housing for nuns/sisters)  It was built in the very beginning of the 1900's, (1908 if I remember correctly). The building was enormous, 4 floors, but could easily have been 7 or 8 if the ceilings weren't so high. The top floor was an attic that was partially converted into an art studio. 

Just like any old college, mine was rife with campust ghost stories. The history of catholicism gave our stories a focus on suicidal nuns whose spirits still roam the campus, corrupt priests who may have been worshiping the ""wrong side""; all the stereotypical urban-legends that everyone has heard too many times. I tried my best to pay no mind to these stories, but when you're alone in these enormous, dim, drafty ancient hallways late at night it's hard to think of anything but. A practicing catholic would certainly consider me an atheist, but I don't care if you believe in nothing or everything, you walk down those halls by yourself, you will feel something that is not right, unwelcomed. 



As an art major I spent the majority of my four years in the attic. I never felt comfortable up there, whether I was in a group or by myself, day or night. There were few windows, and the windows that did exist usually faced brick walls that made up the equally creepy bell tower and arches. There were random storage closets spread throughout that contained equally unsettling remnants from when the building was used for housing.


The dark rooms, located in the attic area had keys you needed to get from security guards to access at any time of the day. The labs close at 11pm. If you did not return your key by then you would have your lab rights revoked. I knew I needed to spend a lot of time in there to finish my senior thesis so I checked out a key and had it copied at a hardware store. I then returned the original allowing me to sneak in whenever I wanted. 


Insomnia has been something I've been dealing with since 3rd grade and still do to this day. I had experienced my first bout of sleep paralysis at this age. I attribute this to the cause of my insomnia. It's still something that still troubles me to this day. When you experience sleep paralysis you will never feel more alone. It doesn't matter if you're sleeping 3 inches away from a warm body, you will feel like the only person in existence. When you're a child you are completely dependent on others, needless to say it left a lasting impression on me.


After this experience the thought of sleeping terrified me. At first I used to hate my inability to sleep and function with the rest of the world, but as time grew on I began to enjoy the solidarity that one can only find at 3AM. The world just feels like it's at a standstill. Go outside at these hours and you will experience a brand new world. I also found that at these hours I was my most productive, with nothing to distract me other than infomercials and my own overactive imagination.


My unusual sleeping pattern combined with my job, other classes, and general lifestyle of a 21 year old left little time to spend in the lab at normal hours. Now that I had my very own unregistered key to the art floor I was able to work whenever I wanted, with the peace and solitude that I've come to love at 3 in the morning.

50,Ragged Lake,1298920715,"I drove up this past weekend, not to the lake, but to the township that it's a part of. Now, this town is so rinky dink that you'd be hard-pressed to even find it on a map, but there was microfiche of the local newspaper at the library, dating as far back as 1927. There were also a good number of almanacs for the area, and some books on the history of the town and the surrounding countryside (including the lake). I took lots of notes, so all this is all kind of scrambled, and I apologize.

I had no idea this place had such a violent history. That's the first thing I gotta say.

The earliest noteworthy event was that the town was ransacked by the British during the war of 1812 and a number of farmers were killed when they refused to house British troops. After the majority of the British army had moved on, some of the remaining farmers gathered secretly and decided to slaughter the troops left behind, which consisted mostly of wounded soldiers and those who were tending to the wounded. They dragged them out of their beds in the middle of the night, stabbed and hacked them up with their farm implements, then scattered the remains in the woods for wild animals to destroy the evidence. The town was so small and off the beaten path that it was never discovered, but seven different people confessed to taking part in the killings in 1815, after amnesty was declared. There was a cemetery built to commemorate both the farmers AND the troops who were killed. I've seen that cemetery... it's located on the southern side of the lake, at the end of a small service road just off the main road. A bunch of small headstones, but if any of them had names, they had worn off years ago. You would think a place like that would be rife with negative energy, but I don't recall feeling any sort of danger the couple times I explored the area as a kid. Compared to the woods and the lake itself, the graveyard was relatively harmless.

There was a court case in 1953 involving a man named Robert Wilder who murdered his two kids out on the lake. Apparently, he calmly took the older son out in a boat under the pretense of going fishing, then pushed him out of the boat and held his head underwater with an oar. Then he rowed back to shore, convinced the younger son to come out with him and repeated the event. Wilder's defense was that the boys had ""gone bad"". According to his testimony, they acted themselves during the day, but at night they became hysterical. He said that he found them digging holes all around the yard one night, found the family cat mutilated under the porch, and that when he tried to talk to them about it, they attacked him and he had to lock himself in his room to keep them from killing him. The next morning, they acted as if they didn't remember anything, so Bob decided they were possessed and took them on a little boat ride. Needless to say, Mr. Wilder was found guilty, but was sent to a psychiatric hospital. I see it one of two ways: either the boys did act violently and strangely, and Wilder was telling the truth, or Wilder himself went insane. Either way you look at it, the prognosis didn't look good there.

Hmmm... I've got a number of pages of notes I took that I can't read at all now. That's weird.

Some kids went missing from the 4H camp located on the north shore of the lake back in 1982. Not much detail to this story, but it was a bird watching group, so no big loss there. The camp remained open another five years, so I guess the disappearance of some aspiring ornithologists didn't hurt their business too much.

Oh this was interesting... a man in 1986 claimed that he went hiking in the woods west of the lake, got turned around, lost the trail, found a service road, followed it a mile and found himself in a town about 3 hours away-- by car. He tried to retrace his steps later with a reporter, but couldn't. All those times I got lost in the woods and felt like things were moving with the intent of keeping me lost, I guess I was lucky I didn't pop out miles away to the southwest.

Shit, this one seemed so ludicrous I had to do some fact checking to make sure it was real. Apparently, an aspiring author  bought some property in the late 70s on the west side of the lake and spent months there in seclusion, working on a book. He got to be a pretty regular sight at the local grocery store, stocking up on food and supplies every week, but wouldn't talk directly to anybody. He missed a week, so the grocer drove out after work to make sure he was alright. When nobody answered, the grocer drove home and called the police. The sheriff department busted in his door, but the cabin was empty. They had to bust in a second locked door to some study, where they found his typewriter, an unfinished copy of his book, hundreds of cigarette butts, *and a human hand* which according to the police report had been gnawed off at the wrist. They couldn't say for certain it was his, but there was nothing more of him ever found.

Even more interesting, his sister came out to collect his stuff and read the book. Apparently she was so disgusted by what she read that she left it behind. The next owner of the cabin read it, then donated it to the library. I tried to see if I could check it out, but it went missing about 15 years ago. I asked around, and apparently the writing in it got really erratic. The details I could pull out of people were that the plot started out about a couple reuniting after war, but it took a turn into stuff about monsters in the shadows and a cult that worshipped plant life and sacrificed animals and people to ""the Tree God"". The lady at the post office said she had read the book when she was younger, and that for a while it was almost required reading if you wanted to be cool at the local high school.

There were some interesting deaths/accidents also that I found.

1. A worker who was clearing downed branches after an ice storm got his arm caught in a woodchipper. He survived, but yuck.

2. Approximately 35 different people have drowned for various reasons in the lake over the years.

3. An old, retired guy was found frozen to death in his boathouse. The assumption was that he'd gotten locked out of his cabin during a snow storm and tried to get by in the boathouse for warmth.

4. There were a huge number of ""death by misadventures"" in the police blotters. I guess people ran into bears or got lost in the woods or some such.

I wish I had more to tell y'all, but after I started asking around about the author's disappearance, a lot of the friendly people who had been so forthcoming when I started doing this research seemed to clam right up and refused to talk to me; so I became restricted to just the materials I could find at the library and sheriff's office.

One thing's for certain, if I wasn't already creeped out by that place, I would definitely be now. I didn't go anywhere near the west side of the lake, where the majority of these incidents took place, and where the cabin my father owns just happens to be situated. That was one thing a lot of the people in the town agreed on... the west side of the lake and the woods that cover it are home to an untold number of mysteries.",nosleep,ViolinTax,/r/nosleep/comments/fuhjx/ragged_lake/

52,Redstone...,1298912360,"(I posted some photos of this place the other day. Here's a link: [The Quarry](http://www.flickr.com/photos/59964710@N04/))

This happened to my friends and I about a year ago. This is the first time I’ve felt like I can talk about it.

We were on a camping trip at an abandoned mining town last February. It was a spooky place, even in the daylight. It had been vacant since the turn of the last century. There were piles of scrap metal, bare foundations, collapsed shacks, weird pieces of rusting machinery, and the husk of an old piano scattered around the area, all things we had observed while hiking up to what my friend Dave, who had been there before, called the “crown jewel”.

It turned out to be a hulking, empty house with holes in the exterior and rotting insides. There was an ominous, off-putting sentence scrawled across the entryway to a large room from the foyer: 
“Give Manson some credit”. 

“Creepy, huh?” asked Dave.

The worst part, though, was that someone was obviously living there. The largest room in the house had a bunch of chairs set up in a circle. This was where we decided to camp for the night. We say down and cracked open some beers.

About a half hour later, my friend Andy said “so who do you think lives here?”

“I do.” Someone was standing in the rear entrance. Shock stabbed me.
After at least ten seconds of shocked silence, Dave finally said “hey, uh, sorry man, we didn’t know…”

“No, it’s fine!” he said. His scruffy beard was evidence that he had been out in the woods for a long time. “I’m glad to have some company!”

So despite the shock, we offered him a beer, and the more we talked, the more normal he seemed. His name was Steffan.

A couple of hours later, Steffan announced that he was going to bed. He sleeps outside, he explained, so we said goodnight and lay down in the living room. Everyone had calmed down a bit, but I was still freaked out. I lay awake for at least an hour, but finally fell asleep.
When I woke up awhile later, it was still dark out, and I could tell something was wrong. I sat up and rubbed my eyes. Andy was gone.

I woke Dave up. “He probably just stepped out to take a piss,” said Dave.

“Well, let’s wait up for him just in case.”

Then  we heard Andy screaming way off in the distance. It was panicked, lost, and he was yelling for help.”Oh shit Dave, what do we do?”

“Fuck. Where’s Steffan? He sleeps outside? Shit, what if it was him?”

Andy’s screaming stopped.

We sat terrified and still, waiting to hear more  from Andy.

“Hey guys, did you hear that?” It was Steffan, standing in the rear doorway.

“OH SHIT! RUN!” said Dave, and we booked it into the woods. About sixty feet in, we turned around and saw that Steffan wasn’t chasing us. We crouched down and looked at the house. Everything was still and quiet.

After a few moments, I said “I think we need to get out of here.”
“We need to find Andy. Do you have your cellphone?” asked Dave.

“Oh shit – it’s in the house.”

“We have to get it. I can’t leave here without finding Andy first.”

“Alright man,” I said, and we began to creep slowly back towards the house. When we were close, we could hear Steffan talking. It sounded like he was on the phone.

“Yeah, they were here just a minute ago. They ran. But don’t worry. I’ll hunt them down.”

And I panicked. I couldn’t take it. Something overcame me, and as soon as I saw the path leading away from the house, back to the cars, I booked it. I’m ashamed now to say it, but I just couldn’t take it. I ran and ran, fear and guilt seizing my heart. Dave wasn’t following me.

When I got back to the cars, I nearly collapsed from exhaustion. I leaned against the truck to catch my breath, and when I looked up, I saw that someone was in there. Whoever it was looked up, and when they saw me, they burst out of the side door.

It was Andy. “Holy shit man! I got lost in the woods. Scared the hell out of me. I was yelling for help, didn’t you hear me? I just called your phone – Steffan picked up and said you guys were missing! I thought he’d killed you or something!”

I was stunned. “We thought he’d killed you too!”

“Well where the hell is Dave? He wasn’t with you?”

“I ditched him. I ran,” I said, feeling sick. That’s when we heard Dave yelling, and someone else screaming, and it was hard to tell who was who, who was angry and who was terrified – and then we heard footsteps, and saw Steffan run past bleeding from his head and into the woods, and then Dave was behind him holding a big stick, shirt covered in blood.

Dave turned and looked at us, and when he realized what had happened, the bloody stick fell from his hand. His eyes were dead. “I would have killed him. I thought he did something to you Andy. If I had caught him, I would have killed him.” 

Dave threw up.

This happened to my friends and I about a year ago. This is the first time I’ve felt like I can talk about it.
We were on a camping trip at an abandoned mining town last February. It was a spooky place, even in the daylight. It had been vacant since the turn of the last century. There were piles of scrap metal, bare foundations, collapsed shacks, weird pieces of rusting machinery, and the husk of an old piano scattered around the area, all things we had observed while hiking up to what my friend Dave, who had been there before, called the “crown jewel”.
It turned out to be a hulking, empty house with holes in the exterior and rotting insides. There was an ominous, off-putting sentence scrawled across the entryway to a large room from the foyer: 
“Give Manson some credit”. 
“Creepy, huh?” asked Dave.
The worst part, though, was that someone was obviously living there. The largest room in the house had a bunch of chairs set up in a circle. This was where we decided to camp for the night. We say down and cracked open some beers.
About a half hour later, my friend Andy said “so who do you think lives here?”
“I do.” Someone was standing in the rear entrance. Shock stabbed me.
After at least ten seconds of shocked silence, Dave finally said “hey, uh, sorry man, we didn’t know…”
“No, it’s fine!” he said. His scruffy beard was evidence that he had been out in the woods for a long time. “I’m glad to have some company!”
So despite the shock, we offered him a beer, and the more we talked, the more normal he seemed. His name was Steffan.
A couple of hours later, Steffan announced that he was going to bed. He sleeps outside, he explained, so we said goodnight and lay down in the living room. Everyone had calmed down a bit, but I was still freaked out. I lay awake for at least an hour, but finally fell asleep.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fudbr/the_quarry_part_1_redstone_nh/

56,I don't know what to do...need help...,1298904779,"Some background first:  I'm a single guy in my early thirties.  I live alone in a pretty normal house in the suburbs.  Three bedrooms - though I use one bedroom as an office and the other as a music room.  The house was built in the 90s and, as far as I know, has only had one prior owner.

So...it all started when I brought a girl home from the bar after a night of fun.  One thing leads to another and we go to the bedroom.  Things proceed as expected and after we're done, we're just spending some time cuddling and stuff but we're both pretty buzzed.  Somehow, the conversation turns to the supernatural.  I'm a pure skeptic and...well...I guess I was just being kind of an asshole.  I don't know what I said but it was condescending, dismissive, and kinda mocking.  I wasn't really mocking her but sort of making fun of ghosts and the like.

Well, after I finish my little rant...things got uncomfortable.  It was pretty tense in the room and the feel-good vibe we had was just gone.  She excused herself to use the bathroom and I guess she felt it too...she told me she wanted to leave.  I was ok with that, since I just assumed that the tension in the room was because I offended her...so she leaves and I basically just pass out.

The next morning I'm a bit hung over but nothing is unusual.  I go about my day and return home at night...eventually, I go to bed.   I have a decent sized master bedroom with a walk in closet - the hallway door is to the left of the bed and the closet and bathroom doors are basically opposite the foot of the bed.  I'm lying in bed, trying to go to sleep...and I just notice that the closet door is open about an inch.  Closet being a closet, it is pitch black inside.  I'm staring at the door and I just have this horrible feeling - just like when you were a kid and you KNEW there was a monster inside.  I can barely do it but I bring myself to get up and close the closet door.  First thing I notice is it is cold - WAY cold - right by the door (there's no vents or windows in the closet).  But I close the door and lie down...I'm a little freaked out but I eventually fall asleep.

I sleep through the night and wake the next morning.  I'm groggy but I remember the thing with the closet and I feel pretty silly...but then I notice that the closet is open about 2 inches.  The door closes securely and I have no pets.  I'm a little uneasy but since it is morning, I just chalk it up to an overactive imagination or dreams or something.  

That evening, I come back home, relax, and eventually go to bed.  Again, I see the closet...but this time, it is closed.  I feel stupid and paranoid but I can't seem to sleep...so I grab a really large piece of luggage I never bothered to unpack (I'm a bachelor after all) - it is pretty heavy.  Heavy enough that the airline wouldn't let me bring it on and I needed to redistribute some of the weight to my carry on.  This thing doesn't fall over or move unless you move it.  I put that in front of the door, think that is that, and go to sleep.

I wake in the middle of the night...around 2:30.  Immediately, I feel creeped out - I look at the closet and sure enough, it is open.  Now it is open 3 or 4 inches - definitely more - and still black inside.  If anything, it almost looks like the blackness is seeping out but I don't know if it is my imagination or what.  I turn on the lights, see nothing weird...except, of course, the door has opened and PUSHED the luggage.  It is still in front of the door but pushed as though someone just opened the door from the inside.

I'm COMPLETELY freaked out.  I realize I can't sleep anymore, get up and go lay on the couch and eventually fall asleep watching TV in the living room.

The next night...I don't know...I just can't bring myself to sleep in my bedroom.  I feel like a baby...but somehow, I know that damn door will be open wider...and I'm afraid of what will happen if I actually can see what's in there.  I grab that luggage, a pillow, and blanket, and just decide to sleep on the couch.  I shut my bedroom door for good measure.

I sleep on the couch for about a week...and I'm feeling ok.  I was feeling embarrassed and was considering ""moving back in"" today...and then I noticed this morning that the bedroom door was open about an inch or two.  I feel like I'm losing it this morning...I know the closet door will be wide open if I go in there...and what happens when the bedroom door is open too?

This is totally nuts...I can't tell anyone about this.  I haven't really seen anything weird and there haven't been any sounds or anything.  Just this horrible feeling and the damn doors.  I locked the bedroom door...but I don't think it is going to help.  I can't help but feel like I pissed something off that night when I was with that girl...I don't know if it is screwing with me or going to come for me or what...but I don't know what to do when those doors are open.

Please...anyone have advice?  Help!  I feel like I can't tell anyone...they'll think I'm insane!

58,Lucky Boy...,1298888700,"There is a town in the heart of British Columbia, Canada that, in one afternoon went from being one of the most prosperous boom towns a person could ever imagine to being completely wiped off the map. 

It was a mining town back in the early 1900's, with a population of about 10,000. The town was located right at the base of a mountain where many of the town's inhabitants worked in the mine. The mine cut deep into the mountain and tonnes of copper and gold were extracted from the mine daily.

The people of the town were part of a healthy, booming economy. The miners and their family were well provided for by the shops and farms there and the shop keeps and farmers were so grateful for all the business that they held festivals and celebrations almost weekly.

This town, nestled in mountains of British Columbia was easily the best place any of it's inhabitants had ever lived. That is, until the day of the bump.

For those that are unfamiliar, a 'bump' is an underground earthquake. In this instance, the bump was thought to have been caused when a large section of the mine collapsed. Over 2 kilometers of a deep section of the mine shaft collapsed in on itself and caused a huge shockwave . This shockwave literally cracked the mountains facade and the entire side of the mountain broke free. As you can imagine this caused an epic landslide that buried the entire town. 

The miners who were in the mine that afternoon found themselves trapped. Fearing the worst, they realized help would not be coming from the other side. They used explosives, even at great risk of trapping themselves further to try and get themselves free. Their gamble payed off and they managed to blow out a hole and escape.

Once out of the mine, the miners saw the devastation before them. The entire town was just gone.... They wandered around where their town used to be looking for survivors. There was nothing, the entire side of the mountain had buried everything, including the church and the hotel both of which were 3 stories high.

Then just when it they were about to give up hope, they heard it. In the distance, just beyond the town, a baby was crying. The miners rushed over and there he was. On top of a boulder, a boulder the size of a car, a boulder that had travelled with the landslide from somewhere in the mountain high above, on top of this boulder was a baby boy. He was covered head to toe in dirt and grime but other than that there was not a scratch or bruise on him. He was the town's only survivor....",nosleep,KanadianLogik,/r/nosleep/comments/fu85f/lucky_boy/
59,I dream parts of my next day. ,1298882370,"And it terrifies me. Backstory. 

When I was 8 years old I had a dream of a house. This house was plain. White painted bricks, two windows, a small back porch, a clothesline with an inflatable palm tree. 2 years ago. I saw it. The exact house from my dream. Detail for detail. It was on a church trip. TBH, I thought it was amazing that I had dreamed the future so early in my life. It was extreme deja vu. 

Since then. I've seen more things from my dreams. Even scenes from my day. They've been getting more frequent. I even dreamed a friends funeral. I honestly am scared of my dreams. When I have terrible dreams with murder or someone attacking me or someone I love I usually don't want to sleep the next night. Usually if I sleep for short periods or take sleeping pills the dreams stop for a week or so. 

As I write this I'm trying to avoid sleep. Through the past few nights I've seen murders and a car accident. I'm scared to go to sleep but I don't want to take pills anymore. I just want the dreams to stop. 

I do not believe in the supernatural. I can't find any explanation for what I'm going through although I've been so busy I haven't had time for any more than random webpages. ",nosleep,insomniacally,/r/nosleep/comments/fu6zl/i_dream_parts_of_my_next_day/

61,the windows,1298874826,"I wake up on the sidewalk, facing my yard; the windows above the porch, the ones usually boarded up and painted over, lit up brightly as if they are eyes watching me. I wake up outside of my house, outside of my mind, convinced that there is something in my attic, something inhuman…

This has happened more than once. Each time, I look around and realize where I am, look back up at the windows and they are back to how they usually are: covered up, painted that same hideous mint color that the rest of the house is slathered in. Tonight is no different. The front door is wide open when I walk back up the small steps of my porch and enter my home. Every light inside is on and I have to walk through the large area, flipping each light switch off.

I make it back into my bed finally, and that’s when the footsteps begin. They are light, but constantly walking back and forth above, and it isn’t long before the thump, silence, and long noises of something heavy being dragged.

I’ve stopped trying to wake up my boyfriend and convince him the noises are real. Even with every light in the house on, he sleeps soundly. When I tried to tell him in the past, he just gave me weird looks. I stopped bringing it up weeks ago. 

I fall back asleep just after the dragging sounds stop, but this time, instead of sleeping till morning like usual, I wake up to her standing over me.

I’ve seen her before, out of the corner of my eye; sometimes during the day, but usually at night. Her face was a pretty one, small lips, petite nose, slender neck and jaw. Her eyes, though… Her eyes are covered by a bandage wound tightly around her head, blood stains and drips from where her eyes would be. 

She wears a black dress, tattered and torn in most places, and she carries a large knife. She is holding it above me when I wake up for the second time. I can’t move, I can barely breathe. She smiles at me, sickeningly sweet, forcing her bandages to gap a little bit, allowing me to see a millimeter underneath. There is nothing in her eye sockets.

Slowly, she lowers the blade and it is cool against the heat of my flesh. She runs it down over my breasts, stomach, hipbone and inch by inch along my leg. Pulling it upwards, she retraces her movements, but this time it is with the blade side. She is ripping me open, blood is pouring out of me with each pump from my heart hammering wildly in my chest.

She reaches my ribcage and with a quick cut, exposes my lung, peeling it back and withdrawing my heart. It’s still beating in her hand when she puts it in her mouth and bites down.

I wake up outside again, the lights above on again, this time illuminating me brightly. I am covered in blood, it’s smeared across my shirt and underwear. My mouth tastes horrible. A knife falls from my left hand, clattering on the cement. The front door is wide open and my own footprints track outside, growing less and less bloody with each step. 

I have to be dreaming.

This must be a dream.

62,The Girl and Her Cat,1298874485,"A little background details: I currently live in Alaska and as most people know, during the winter months there is very little sunlight. Sun rises around 10am, sets around 4pm. This happened to me back in November when I had just finished up my first week of living alone in my new apartment.

I was situated on the third floor of a two year old apartment complex. I had just moved out of my parents’ house as I thought I needed to be more independent. During the first week, nothing happened that was out of the ordinary and everything was functioning as they should (appliances, electronics, etc). However, after the seventh day of living in the apartment, strange things began to happen which ultimately made me choose to return home, with my parents.

I was returning home from my friend’s house, it was around 1am. I had gone to the grocery earlier that day so my hands were pretty full as I was walking towards the locked gate of the apartment complex. However, when I got to the gate, the lock appeared to be mangled and nonfunctioning. I put it at the back of my mind and decided to tell the landlord the next day. As I was approaching the front door to my apartment complex (there were three separate apartment complexes within a courtyard) I felt something or someone was behind me. At first I ignored it (problems go away when you ignore them, right?). Probably about ten feet later I heard light thumps behind me. I stopped walking and just stood there, not yet turning around. I got goosebumps and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. The light thumping stopped, and I resumed walking at a brisker pace. Just as I was taking my fourth step, the thumping continued and I quickly turned my head and saw a black cat staring at me. I was startled and I dropped my bag of groceries, the contents of which spread out on the ground. I picked up the bag and looked around for the cat, but it was gone. I picked up the remainder of my groceries and hurriedly made my way to the apartment complex and into my apartment. I stayed awake for about two hours while I watched the new episode of House and Being Human on my DVR. I decided to head to bed since it was about 3:15am. When I was just about to close my bedroom door, I heard a loud bang that came from my livingroom as if someone had hit a window. I thought it was a bird so I went to investigate. Immediately when my livingroom came into view, my blood ran cold. I saw two cat eyes in the window, seemingly looking straight at me. They were making those weird reflections that cat eyes make in the dark. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t think. The only thing running through my mind was RUN! But I had nowhere to run to, I was on the third floor. How is a cat outside my window? There is no lattice or ledge for it to sit on, I thought to myself. A few seconds later, I sneezed and the cat eyes were gone. I quickly retreated to my bedroom (which luckily had no windows) and pulled the covers over my head. Thinking I was safe, I quickly fell asleep.

A few days went by with no strange happenings or sightings. I did have a little bit to drink that night so I just brushed it off and assumed I hallucinated.

Exactly a week later I woke up because I thought I smelled something burning. I looked at the clock and it was 3:15am, the second hand wasn’t moving (the hands were glow in the dark) so I got up and tapped the clock a few times. The second hand started moving again and I was about to head back to sleep. As I was getting comfortable I noticed a faint light coming from the direction of the livingroom (I left my bedroom door open that night). I recalled what happened a week before and I stopped breathing, hoping the light would disappear. Twenty seconds passed by (but it seemed so much longer than that) and the light was still on. I cursed silently under my breath and slowly got out of bed to investigate. I walked out of my bedroom, towards the livingroom. My bathroom light was on (it was pretty much on the opposite side of my apartment than my bedroom). I stood there for a few minutes, not entirely sure what to do, silently hoping that the light would turn off. But they didn’t. I gathered all the courage I could muster. I ran towards my bathroom, stuck my hand in, turned off the light, and ran back to my bedroom, closing and locking the door and jumping into bed. I looked at the clock once more and I was petrified. The second hand had just passed the 45 second tick mark. It was still 3:15am. I knew I had been gone for at least 5 minutes. I couldn’t get out of bed, I felt heaviness on my chest and I started to breathe irregularly. What is going on? I couldn’t rationalize anything that had happened tonight. I forced my eyes closed and I went back to sleep.

I woke up and immediately looked at the clock. Everything seemed normal; it was 8:30am. I got out of bed and made my way to the bathroom, recalling the events of last night. I stood about ten feet away from the door, just staring into the room. No noises, no lights turning on/off, everything seemed normal. I went into the bathroom and took a shower. I put on a towel and opened the bathroom door. I froze. I stopped breathing. I wouldn’t allow myself to blink. Standing about ten feet away from me was a girl. She looked like she was eight years old. She had short, black hair and very pale skin. She was holding a black cat which she lightly petted, over and over. They both were looking straight at me. It was no mistake, this cat is the same one I saw a week ago outside in the courtyard. In an instant, the girl let go of her cat and at the same time opened her mouth an impossible length and let out of a shrill scream. The cat jumped at me and I fell backwards, hitting my head on the bathroom counter. 

I woke up in my bed, drenched in sweat. My hands were clasped tightly to the blanket, my knuckles were white. It was a dream… just a dream, I thought to myself. Just then, I felt a sharp pain on my chest. I got up and stood in front of my body mirror. I always wear a white shirt to bed. Red stains appeared in streaks on my shirt, I removed it at once. On my chest I found four claw marks, about three inches in length and they were bleeding pretty badly.

These few experiences unnerved me so heavily that I had to talk with my landlord about terminating my lease ahead of time. I told him everything that had happened and showed him my bandaged up claw marks. I told him about my dream and the little girl and immediately he became angry. He told me to stop lying just so I can get out of my lease. After a few minutes of arguing, he calmed down and began to cry. “My daughter, Alice… she was only eight years old when she didn’t come home from school two years ago. The police never found her or any evidence that could have explained what happened. She had a cat, his name was Milo and she loved him very much. I found Milo dead out in the courtyard two weeks after my daughter went missing. There was a note under him: Don’t worry daddy, Milo is with me now.”

The landlord agreed to terminate my lease so long as I pay rent for each month that he does not find a new tenant. I returned home and nothing out of the ordinary has happened.

63,Never been afraid of ghosts before..,1298870959,"I had this long dream recently which contained some very creepy stuff and I thought I'd share it with you guys.

I was fooling around with a mix of co-workers and classmates in a forbidden building of some kind and as we were about to hop a fence to leave a strange dog caught my eye.

The dog was just a few feet away from me but it somehow looked like it was a light projection. I happily waved hello to the dog and it responded cheerfully by turning around in a circle and stopping at me again. As it moved it sort of flickered and was sort of choppy in its movements similar to lag in video games. I then decided to wave goodbye to the dog and it then responded by running away directly towards a brick wall just a few feet behind it. I caught a glimpse of it running in the distance, growing smaller, which was projected on the same wall a few bricks higher. But just for a fragment of a second.

Some time passes and for some reason I find myself returning to this building, though alone this time. I walk through one room containing a sink, a bathroom stall and some washing machines followed by a simple 12 foot hall with doors at each end into an odd hospital bedroom.

In this room sits a man on a bed with a living one eyed doll sitting in a wheelchair by his side. They spoke to me. The doll had an orange left eye. At one point it rotated it's head full circle and when it faced me again it now only had a purple right eye.

As I was talking to the man the doll transformed into a disgusting pale old woman who immediately jumped out of the wheelchair and started gropping me. I was disturbed and trying to push her hand away as she forcibly fondled me. The sitting man seemed amused.

I finally violently push the old hag into a corner and immiediatly diverted my attention to the bottom of a short flight of stairs in the same room. At the bottom stood a black child with his arms slightly lifted at his side who was jittering at rapid speeds and violently jerking his head and seizuring. I decided to GTFO.

As I pushed open the first door to the short hall I encountered a black man in a jumpsuit who I presumed worked there. I stupidly said ""Man! You ever get the feeling this place is haunted!?"" And he just stood there for a second with a look of shock on his face almost like he knew exactly what I was talking about.

I walked passed him but as I was about to go through the second door I heard a child's playfull yet very creepy chanting. I slowly pushed open the door and saw that the sort of bathroom was now smeered with blood and littered with corpses with one looking like he'd been drowned in the large sink.

When I looked to the far right of the room I caught eyes with a black baby girl who was standing on her feet but was curled into a ball. She immediately stopped chanting and let out a deathly screech. I was terrified and fled for the door out. But just as I'd reached it I stopped and felt asthough It was too late. I'd died. She litterally scared the life out of me and I was now doomed to walk this building a ghost. Like the rest of them.


I know it's retarded. Odd that so many of the ghosts were black but I felt the need to mention it for the sake of the picture.

67,The Little Girl In My House,1298838797," My dad told me this story when i was about 8 years old, I'm not a writer, so bear with me. 
 My parent's bedroom was upstairs, and being an old house (one of the first built in my town, approximately 110 years old to this date) the whole placement of room and stairs was off beat. The stairs leading into their room led directly into their room, with an open wall on the right side of te stairs. (sorry I have no pictures, but it's hard to explain). I was not born at this time, but my older sister would have been about 6 or 7. 
  

   To enter my sisters room, you'd have to walk through a small corrider in my parents room. My sister, who we'll named Haley, had what sounded like a creepy room. Clown wallpaper, (which was from the original homeowners; my parents left it up because they had moved in only a few weeks before the incident), and a closet that couldn't shut all the way. It would be very dark at night, even though there was a street light right otuside the window.
  

   
   My sister would always complain about seeing a little girl in her room. She described her as having long dark hair, wearing a night gown, and always sucking her thumb. The girl would have very dark eyes; you wouldn't be able to see anything other then large, black sockets. She would tell my parents about this apparition and they would just assume it was an imaginary friend, or she'd be having a dream. Typical parents. 
  

  
   One night, my dad awoke to see what he thought was Haley standing next to my parent's bed, sucking her thumb. My dad can be a real dick, and is generally grumpy all the time. 


  
  ""What is it Haley?"" he mumbled.
  

  She didn't move. She just stood there, sucking her thumb.
  

  ""What do you want?"" he demanded a second time. Still no response.
  
  
  ""Haley, go back to bed"" He ordered and he turned the other way, facing away from her. 


   He had the feeling that something was watching him the entire time, and since he didn't hear any fotosteps going back into her room, he assumed Haley was still there. He peeked over his shoulder and noticed her just standing there like before, thumb in mouth.
 He woke up my mom and told him to send Haley to bed herself, because she wasn't listening to him when he did. My mom turned and told my dad nothing was there. Of course. He turned to see that the apparition was gone, even though he had only turned his head for no more then 5 seconds. My mom turned on the lamp next to her bed and they searched around their room and found nothing. He ventured into my sister's room, and found her tucked in bed, fast asleep. As he was exiting her room, he noticed her closet, wide open. It was weird because they never had the closet opened, and Haley always had a fear of the damn things, and never opened them. A little shaken, they went back to sleep.
  

 The next morning, my dad confronted Haley about the whole thing. 
 ""Did you come into our room last night?"" he asked.
 ""nope"" she replied
 

   My dad wasn't to surprised by this, but proceeded to ask her some questions, this time about the girl.


   ""Does she talk alot?"" he asked
   ""No, she just stands there sucking her thumb.""
  
   
   At this moment my dad's heart felt like it was in the pit of his stomach.
   ""Does she come out much?"" he said to her, more hesitantly.
   ""Yes, but she didn't last night, I got to go to sleep for the first time in a while! She usually comes out of my closet and sits on my bed, but didn't last night""
  

  It's been 15 years since this has happend, and they both still swear as to seeing the little girl. My mom on the other hand has never seen her, but still beleives my sister and father. I occasionally see things in the corner of my eye, but don't think too much of it. 
 The thing is, I now sleep in my parents old room where the whole thing took place, and I sometimes get the feeling of being watched, but I'm to big of a pussy to look and see if there's a little girl staring at me sucking her thumb.



EDIT; I mentioned to my dad that I posted this on Reddit and he asked me if I added the part about finding the tombstone, which I completly forgot about! Anyways, my neighbours were digging up their septic tank and while digging came across a flat rectangular rock buried about a metre underground. They think it was a tombstone because there was definate writing on the slab, they jsut couldn't make it out.

My biological father and his wife were getting a divorce when she died. She didn't just die anywhere - she died in the living room of the house. Days before she died she had told him (and in front of plenty of people) that he'd never live in that house in peace. She was sick and had fluids filling her lungs and had to get them drained - she moved back in with my father so she would be closer to the hospital. As this was told by him to my mother, one night they fell asleep in the living room and when he awoke again she had died essentially from drowning. The first sight of her after death was he went to her funeral and when he got home - as he said - she was sitting on the couch and asked him where he'd been before he left the house. After this everyone knew he wouldn't enter that house alone.",nosleep,NoApollonia,/r/nosleep/comments/ftokl/what_started_the_haunting/
71,Paranormal encounters beyond the safety of sleep.,1298808648,"I have not slept in about 60ish hours. I've yet to begin feeling sleepy but considering some auditory hallucinations, I'd ask something.

I've heard that as one becomes more sleep deprived it becomes easier to interact with beings which have no definite form. Does r/nosleep have any such encounters?  The last rime I did not sleep for 60 hours I started having visual hallucinations,  but as I became more fatigued they started becoming less of disjointed visual distortions and more like small sprites darting accross my vision and small moving shadows in my peripheral vision accompanied by bizarre shuffling sounds, and I began seeing and hearing very similar things more frequently.

If any other redditors on nosleep have similar experiences I'd love to hear them, as well as your own view of things. I don't usually give in to superstition but I have always believed that it is possible for there to be life, or something like life, which does not share our organic solid and constant existence, I'm certain I am not the only one who has thought of this.

73,The Gray Lady and the Black Man,1298804948,"I have been debating whether or not to post this ever since I found out about this subreddit. I have been in peace for the last two or three years and I have some concerns that talking about this will bring her back. Things have been odd lately, and just now in the shower, psyching myself up to this, even though the door was closed and I forgot to turn the fan on, the room suddenly got cold.

All that said, it is time. It is time to talk about this. All of it. All I can say is I'm sorry I don't have pictures of anything. I can describe anything in further detail upon request.

This starts years ago. My childhood. I live in the same home now as I did then. When I was a child, I realized that something was wrong with a part of our front yard. The yard went back, forming a narrow strip in between our house and our neighbor's house that went back to the fence marking our back yard, it was about 10 feet across and 50 feet deep. 

It was always cold over there. Always darker than the rest of the the outdoors seemed, regardless of the weather. Always smelled off somehow. 

I never had a reason to be afraid of it really, but I was. I was terrified of it, and somehow all of my friends were even without me having to tell them to be. We just never went over there.

Years go by, and I always felt the same about that area. Even as a 16-year-old, I hated that strip of land. Our breaker-box was on the house over there and whenever a fuse was blown, I would make my stepfather or one of my dogs come out there with me to fix it. I wouldn't go alone.

I think because, generally *nobody* wanted to go over there, it was overgrown with plants. Some ivy had taken over, and a large bush dominated the back of it, along with lots of random plants along the side of the house. One day, as I was outside doing yardwork, I noticed all of it was gone. My mother had decided to take out her stress and frustration from other things out on that section of the yard. It was suddenly immaculate, but it still felt wrong. It felt like a disturbed grave.

That was when things began. 

It was subtle at first. Noticeable, but enough that you could shrug it off as your head playing tricks with you. Odd, heavy feelings of a oppressive presence. Waking up suddenly in the middle of the night, feeling like I had been struck hard, and feeling immense fear for no reason I could see. You get the idea.

The first thing that was more overt was when I brought a girl over. I brought girls home from time to time, but this was the first girl I had brought home since the side-yard had been disturbed. She was a friend of mine, I had offered to give her a ride to her boyfriend's house, who was also a friend of hers, and we had stopped at my house so she could use the bathroom, and so I could get something I borrowed from her boyfriend. The bathroom was at the end of the hall, as was my room, and those both shared a wall with the side of the house that was one wall for the side-yard. 

We had been having fun, talking and listening to music, and as we went into the house, we suddenly both stopped talking. It was mid-afternoon, around 3pm, and there was no reason we should have felt anything unusual, but we both did, instantly. We were about to walk down the hall when we stopped. An orb of light was racing from the top of one wall, down to the floor, across the floor, and up the opposite wall, back and forth like a pendulum. I waited for it to stop of shift, thinking it must be coming from one of us, as every door in the hallway was shut and there were no sources of reflection or light in there, but yet it kept going. Tina pointed it out and said something like, ""Woah, what is that?"" I said something like, ""I don't know,"" and we watched it quietly (I just noticed a thumping sound. I'm home alone. It is semi-repetitive, it sounds like it is coming from our garage or in the attic above me, I'm not sure. Hard to describe, not as consistent as a heartbeat, kind of a *thump-thump* followed by a span of 10 seconds or so before the next *thump-thump-thump*. Fuck.) feeling uneasy. After a few seconds, Tina told me she would just use the bathroom at Mike's house, and that we should just go. I agreed, but said I wanted to get whatever it was I wanted to give back to Mike, so I waited for the orb to be at a high point of its passing, and I stepped through to get to my room while she waited in the entryway. After going through, I thought that surely I would disrupt whatever source of light it was coming from, but I did not. The fist-sized orb just kept swing down, across, and up. 

The thumps described earlier have stopped, only to be followed by a louder thump in my kitchen. Like the sound of a slightly open drawer being abruptly shut. I'm glad I have a lot of lights on. I am stronger than she is, and I do not need to fear her.

After getting whatever I had wanted, we left and though the whole event seemed very strange, I didn't think of it much. It was an anomaly, but such things were bound to happen, and there are tons of things I can't explain, so what is one more? The only thing significant to me then was that I wasn't the only person to whom it seemed oddly forbidding; Tina felt it too. Something innocuous somehow had the same effect on both of us. A sort of warning-type feeling.

Then it was back to the subtle things again, until I began dating a girl. I will call her M. 

She felt the same things I did. She would fall asleep in my room, and wake up thinking I had hit her, but I wouldn't be in the room, I would have gotten up to get a drink or something. Things escalated beyond the subtle, fairly quickly. It was clear that things got much worse when she was there, and I began working nights, so I began to encounter these things more often.

One of the least subtle things was also one of the first. She was a paralegal, and one day she was seeing me after having been at work. She had her briefcase with her, and we had been watching a movie in my room when it became clear she was going to leave soon. We turned off the movie and began talking, and at one point she abruptly stopped talking. 

I had a plant in my room. I don't know what it was called, I could find out, but it's late and I don't care that much right now. My mom had thought my room needed some life, so she put it in there one day (the truth is, she didn't have anywhere for it, I think). I didn't complain, I just assumed I would kill it by neglecting it, and it would be gone soon. My mom had plainly stated to me that *I* was to care for the plant.

Only, it never died. It just kept growing. I never watered it once in the 6 months or so I had it, and at one point I asked my mom if she had been, and she said that she had not. It got to the point where it was getting ridiculously big, and I had never watered it. I thought that was odd, but I was mostly amused by it, until this day.

This day, M stopped talking because the plant was making noises. Strange, organic ticking noises. Almost like the kind of staccato clicking a creaky board will make, only this noise was quieter and more of a moist sound, and it was also muffled.

We both turned our attention to it, surprised. After some 30 seconds of this sound persisting, I got up and walked over to the plant, and shuffled it's stalks and leaves, thinking that the noise would stop. It did, while I moved it, and as soon as I stopped it began again. ""Bugs?"" I thought, but the noise hadn't been there once in the last 6 months, and all of a sudden NOW there were bugs? How would they get there now?

M was unnerved by it, and decided that it was time to go. As we were in the entryway, she realized her briefcase was still in my room. She was approaching the front door and asked if I could run and grab it for her- she didn't really want to go back in there. I agreed to, and when I got back in there the plant was still making the noise, but then abruptly stopped. I payed little notice to it, but when I came back to the door, M was standing in the door way, looking... well, pale and afraid. Very afraid.

She said she wanted to go. I asked what was wrong, and she said that while I was gone, she had suddenly heard a splash, and then the sound of wet, quick, bare footsteps.

This was in late Fall, or early Winter, and one of the concave lids had been overturned on our trash cans, so it had collected water.

When I walked over to where she said the sound had come from , I saw that the lid lay in the driveway, with a large puddle of water around it. Small, wet (human) footprints lead off the driveway to the opposite side of the house from the side I had always feared. I looked over there but there was nothing. There was nowhere to go. My neighbors have a chain-link fence, and I had a chain-link gate on that side, neither of them could be interacted with without making further noise, and to skirt the neighbor's fence would lead a person into view from my front door. Nothing was there. 

Things got worse.

74,"The Litter Box
",1298797809,"I live in a small apartment with my wife and two cats. Now, I'm not a big fan of the cats but my wife has had them since before she met me, so you know how that is. I cant stand how all my clothes are constantly covered in cat hair and the apartment always stinks like cat litter. 

   The worst thing about the little fuckers is how they sleep all day but seem to be up all night. They run around the apartment meowing constantly while I'm trying to sleep. Not quiet, cute little meows either, but loud almost distressed meows. It's like the fucking things are trying to keep me awake. Every night I find myself in bed yelling at them to shut up. 

  These damn cats even have their own room in our apartment. The sunroom, basically a closed in patio area, has their water bowl, food bowl and litter boxes. The room is right next to my wife and I's bedroom. I can't tell you how many times I've been woken up by the sounds of the cats meowing and digging in their litter box. Most nights I usually just yell at them to shut up and go back to sleep. However, a few nights ago they just wouldn't shut up, and it sounded like one of them was trying to dig its way to china through the fucking litter box. 

  I decided to get out of bed and actually go give them a good smack. My wife was working a night shift and I was home alone, otherwise this wouldn't have been a good idea. My wife would give me a good smack if she ever saw me lay a finger on her cats.

   I got out of bed and made my way to the sunroom, as soon as I got to the door the cats bolted out. I turned to chase them but stopped when I realized that I could still hear the digging sound coming from the litter box. 

  I turned back and looked into the dark sunroom. It was too dark to see anything, but I could hear the relentless digging and scratching at the litter box. I kept my gaze fixed on the spot in the room where the digging sound was coming from, trying to make out any movement at all.  I reached over and flipped on the lightswitch without taking my eyes off that spot. As soon as I flipped the switch the digging sound stopped but there was nothing there. I had expected a mouse or something so I had been watching closely. 

 I walked closer to the litter box expecting whatever it was to run out at any second, but there was nothing fucking there. I even got my head right down and took a close look. Trust me when I say I can't fucking stand the smell of cat litter, but there I was none the less, with my head just inches away from this litter box looking for some kind of explanation for what I had just been hearing. I even nudged the litter box with my foot to see if I could stir something out of hiding. A mouse, a rat, something. I know I sure as shit wasn't imagining what I had just heard.

   As I was standing there, baffled by this litter box, the cats, who as far as I can tell, like me about as much as I like them, came up to me and started purring and rubbing against my legs. They were meowing too, but now their meows sounded less distressed... less urgent. 

I just kind of shook my head, told the cats to shut up and went back to bed. They stayed quiet for the rest of the night and it's a good thing because I still wanted an excuse to smack them.

Then last night I was woken up again by the same digging sounds coming from the sunroom. There was none of the distressed meowing that usually went along with it and when I opened my eyes I found out why. Both the cats were sleeping in the bed with me. 

  I could hear the digging sound clear as ever, it even sounded like something bigger than a rat or a mouse. Something big enough that whatever it was I should have been able to see it when I had turned the light on the night before. At that point I was too tired and scared to get out of bed, I just buried my head under the pillows to shut out the noise and went back to sleep.

Tonight, it's after midnight. Both cats are laying in the bed beside me, and I'm leaving the light in the sunroom on...",nosleep,KanadianLogik,/r/nosleep/comments/ftmgw/the_litter_box/

77,Hiding place,1298791857,"For years, my sister and I would play hide and seek at my grandfather's house. he had tons of great places to hide, but my favorite was always in his closet. I would run into his bedroom, dart into the closet, and hide beneath his blankets and boxes of stuff. It was hard to know when I was far enough back, but I found that I was deep enough when I felt this pipe stick into my back. When i reached that pipe, i knew my sister would never find me. 

Years went by and when i was in high school, my grandfather had to go to the hospital. He had money, and was very keen on telling people about it, so it came as no surprise when one of his neighbors called and said their were intruders in his house. When my dad and I arrived, the men were gone. The police were already there. My grandfather's neighbor told us that he had just marched up and knocked on the door to scare them away. My dad told him how lucky he was, because my grandfather had a shotgun in the house and if the two men had found it it could have easily been a bad night. I followed him to my grandfather's bedroom where he opened the closet door, reached in, and pulled out the shotgun.  I stared at it as I remembered the pipe that had always jabbed my back, keeping me safe from my sister. My father opened it, revealing two large, red buckshots in the barrel.

78,A spirit summoned by r/nosleep!?  Was it my imagination... or something else?,1298786048,"Okay, so I've been an avid reader of r/nosleep lately and had an account with the user-name *strictlycrazy* which I primarily used for trolling (not usually mean spirited trolling, just posting asinine and stupid commentary) but I had actually garnished a fair amount of karma but I had to delete the entire account.

What happened:  

Last week, either Monday or Tuesday, I posted a question asking if anyone had or knew how to summon a succubus.  I asked mostly in jest because I never really wanted to summon such a thing, I was more interested in stories that have happened to people regarding succubus/incubus'.  I never got a serious answer, mainly just warning saying I should be careful what I invite into my life.  I pay the warnings no mind and go about with my day.

Later on that night I was in my closet getting ready for bed after a long hard day at work and suddenly thought I felt a spider crawling up my back underneath my shirt.  I hate spiders and bugs that can bite especially because they have Brown Recluses and Black Widow spiders (I live in Texas), so I flipped out!  I quickly pulled my shirt off and started trying to find the little bugger before he gets me.

Now here's the creepy part.  After I pulled my shirt off I still felt whatever it was crawling on me so I ran to my sister and asked her if she could see anything crawling around on me but she didn't see anything.

The whole time I can still feel something crawling over my back and chest even though I can't see a damn thing on me with my own two eyes.

I really started to freak out at this point but didn't actually tell anyone what was going on for fear of them labeling me crazy and mentally unstable.

What's even crazier is although I was freaking out I could feel whatever 'it' was better.

It felt like someone or something was gently caressing me with their fingers, like a lover would do.  Here's the weird thing though...  I could feel this 'invisible' hand like it was touching me and not touching me all at the same time kind of like a small tingle of static electricity going over your skin and making your hair stand up yet the whole time it also felt like a freaking hand!

After that I thought I saw the shadows of the house start to move around my peripheral vision.

That was when I had enough and didn't want to keep experiencing it any further, so I did all that I knew how.  I deleted the summoning question followed by entire account and then said many prayers and asked forgiveness for my stupidity.  Drastic measures, but I felt like I invited something in just that easily and I did NOT want it staying around.

Stupid idea altogether I know, now I shant repeat that mistake.

**TLDR;**
I asked how to summon a succubus in r/nosleep and inadvertently conjured one up by asking in the first place.  Later that night I felt someone's 'hand' crawling on me that didn't belong to a body.  I was scared shitless.  Deleted my entire account to rid myself of the spirit.",nosleep,itsnormal4us,/r/nosleep/comments/ftk9b/a_spirit_summoned_by_rnosleep_was_it_my/
79,Something is wrong here..,1298781089,"Hey NoSleep readers, I was just browsing the sub-Reddit..shit. There it is again. Listen, if I don't respond in the ne- dammit, the lights are flickering again. Anyway if I don't respond in the next few hours it means I didn't make it out of here. I'm sorry, I have to be brief. SHIT! That noise again and now the light-switch won't work....I have to go find a weapon of some kind, there may not be time. Stand by for a follow up. 

Edit: OK, found an old baseball bat in my closet. Inside with a flashlight typing as you read this. I caught a few glimpses of it, but you can only make out a sort of reflection/gleam of teeth, and that damn shine that cats and dogs eyes give off. I don't know whats going on-other apartments seem to have lights on, but my power is dead. I can't find my wife either. My dogs havent woken up, witch is odd....Staying hidden for now, thought I heard a low grumble. Turning off the light and closing the laptop till I don't hear it. I don't want to be detected from light under the door...shit, louder now, it's close....stand by.

Update: Were back. Something brushed up against the closet door, made it rattle a little (shitty apartment.) Anyway-after that, there was a loud thump in the bathroom, like something hit the linoleum floor, then there was a scampering of claws on the bathroom floor. It's how my dogs sound when they are trying to gain traction..but they're both crated up for the night. I'm going to move out of the closet. Check on the dogs and look for my wife. I have goosebumps. I'll update again in a few minutes, maybe I should let the dogs look around?

Update 3: The dogs are OK. They're awake, but I opened the crate door and they refuse to come out..Fuck. something is running up the stairs.....fuck this I'm getting in the crate with my dogs and going lights out for a minute....I'll upd

Update 4: Sorry I cut you off, it was too close, whatever it is. I've abandoned the laptop in favor of my phone, as it gives off much less glow. I made it into the kitchen, and slipped in warm, wet fluid. The dogs water bowls are in here, I hope thats what it is..water. Too much of a pussy to look. I felt something hot on my neck. Like warm breath. I think it's toying with me. Still looking for my wife. I'm moving on to the office (second bedroom) for solitude. I can still hear scurrying, but I haven't seen the eyes again. I don't know if that's good or bad. I fear i may have lost her.

Update 5: Those fucking blue and red lights again...how I hate those lights. Someone knocked at the door. I won't answer it. They don't understand. It's the same thing that happened years ago, with my first wife. They didn't believe me then either.
I tried to tell them, i didn't know why they found her like that, her body twisted up...eyes gleaming in the dark of the garage...

It's happening again, it's all that damn --- Thing. It does this to them. I swear it's not me, Redditors. It's not my fault.

Those fucking eyes. When she looked at me in the bathroom, I had to do it. I had to use the bat.

It had taken her. The good new is, I found my wife, nosleep. I finally found her. Please tell them it wasn't my fault. I told her to stay out of the garage. See you all soon....",nosleep,Urban_Monkey_One,/r/nosleep/comments/ftj60/something_is_wrong_here/

81,But No One's Home,1298765274,"This happened to my mother 20-odd years ago. I should mention this happened in a house that was haunted by a family member.

She was living with my biological father and his daughters. Both of his girls (besides me) shared a room. They were both out for the night at a friend's house or at work. My father dragged in and my mom mentioned that both girls were out. He then went past their room on the way to his and ended up coming back to the living room questioning my mother on if Sherry was home since he saw her (her shape) sleeping in her bed. They both ended up going back and with the lights out, they could see the shape of someone sleeping in the bed. Turning on the lights, the ""person"" disappeared.

84,Tiny little crystal,1298756198,"Okay, it's about 1:00 at the time I'm writing this. I'm not afraid to say it: I need help. I'm scared to go out, and my electricity bills are going to be crazy - I'm going to leave the lights on all the time now.

It all started last week.

I was walking across campus to get to my next class, gloved hands clutching each other for any scrap of warmth, any protection from the biting winter air. It had snowed earlier that day, and the ground was covered in a thin blanket of the stuff. Perhaps blanket is the wrong word…the stuff certainly wouldn’t keep the ground warm!

The snow was largely undisturbed, as if it were some sacred thing, save for a few patches here and there were someone had gathered snow to hurl at an unwary passerby. There were also larger battlegrounds where entire sections of grass lay exposed to the world, the snow ripped up for a snowball fight. And there was one peculiar patch of ground, a perfect circle of melted snow, which caught my attention. A small, pale blue crystal laid in the center of it, and I decided to pick it up. It looked valuable; someone had probably lost it, and would certainly be happy to get it back. 

The crystal seemed to…vibrate, I suppose is the correct word. It emanated heat, and continued to do so as I stuffed it in my pocket with my phone. I wrote that off to wishful thinking at the time.

Class progressed as normal, but by the end, I had all but forgotten about the crystal. When I returned to my dorm, extremities red and stinging from the cold, I remembered the crystal. *Oops. I’ll stop by the commons to drop it off at the lost and found when I go for dinner.* I thought.

Then I got a call. As I slid my hand into my blazer, it brushed against the crystal, and grabbed it along with the phone. It found a nice place between my hand and my phone, and it was warm, too. A wonderful change from the largely unheated dorms. 

The call was some solicitor, and I ended the call with disgust before noticing a few figures standing in the tennis courts. They were dressed in a faint grey, and would have blended with the snow had the courts not been swept clean. (My room in Haggett hall provides me easy access to the tennis courts, and I can see it just outside my window.) At the time, I didn’t give another thought to the two figures. If they were dealing drugs, or something illegal, it was none of my business. They could have just as easily been discussing tennis technique. I slipped my phone back into my pocket, and the crystal with it; the crystal was gone from my mind until the next day.

89,Your help please.,1298718799,"Ok, I am by no means bragging about getting laid. If I could I would take it back. I really would. I was merely out two weekends ago and I need your advice. 

A little back story. I have a beautiful young daughter and a filthy ex-wive whose cleanliness was never called into question until I heard her tell me how inferior her choice in sexual partners was, namely me, compared to the rest of the male sex. 

She ties in because she had our little girl for the next two weeks, and I, I went out with a couple of my friends to go bowling. It was a nice way to forget my responsibilities without shirking any duties.

I approached her. She was Tanya and she was attractive in the simple way that an above average girl catches your eye. I had met her earlier in the week when she showed up at my workplace, she a courier with a package for a non-discrepant person on my floor. She needed a signature and I gave it. I tossed it on a non-discrepant desk but when I went back to make small talk she was gone. What I remembered best was how when she handed me the tablet my hand overlapped hers and she held on to it so that contact would last a little longer.
	
So I was confident enough and slightly drunk when I asked her to join us. She smiled impishly, I suppose, and asked if her friends would miss her. She waved at a group and followed me. So we alternated in turns, lost miserably, and she left with me. We walked right past her friends and I was sure they'd stop us, but they didn't even look.
	
I was drunk at that point. I paid for her bus fare, and we made out like a couple of class acts the entire ride. As a drunk I always forget that I am a lady's father. I remember contact for the walk home. We stumbled into each other, would stop, make out, walk, stumble. 	It was nice. She was the first since my wife.

I got her into my room and she got... aggressive, which is weird because it was going... look, it's not that I am a prude. I like a girl who could be rough, but clothes weren't tossed, they were bunched up and hurled. My lamp  was smashed within seconds. My back scratched moments later. She was... a biter. It was a great time with collateral damage.

It was one of those nights where you are afraid you talk in your sleep while everything is too hot and you sweat an embarrassing amount. I kept waking up with my hand just under her breast, and she kept moaning slightly. I remember feeling revulsion and realizing I was in love with my ex wife. I woke up four or seven times and finally opened my eyes. My room was lightly illuminated by the outside streetlights and yet I clearly saw her standing with an arm extended against the door. She was looking down, naked, her breasts hung away at an odd angle and looked cylindrical. I blinked twice and she stayed there. The air was humming. I closed my eyes, and waited for her to open the door or even to hurl on my floor. Yet I could hear no movement.

I lay there for probably a minute or two. I shifted, so she'd remember she was in my house. I lay on my side and opened my eyes, to look at the door but she was gone. So I turned on my back.

She was there, inches from my face. She leaned down, kissed my mouth hard, until my gums bleed. Than she roughly ran her hand across my face. I sat up but she backed away, hunched awkwardly backwards and retreated from the room.

I didn't follow her. I assumed she was drunk, and I was now glad I didn't have her number. I fell asleep and showered right when I woke up.

I felt guilty, which is weird. I drank a little harder than I do and I took to doing things I didn't remember the next morning. I would eat leftovers meant for the next day, or  leave the sink slightly running. It was entirely unlike me. 
	
But my daughter came here yesterday, for her two week stay. She is starting to tell me about how she is glad to have a new mommy that will talk to her when she can't sleep. Who will pet her hair. Who will tell her that Daddy won't leave this time. It is starting to make it hard for me to sleep.

So, Reddit, what I got to ask is how do I get my daughter over my divorce?",nosleep,Kal-Lplus10,/r/nosleep/comments/ft4xs/your_help_please/

91,My father was a large man.,1298690882,"Not in the sense that he was fat, but in the sense that he was muscular in a very rough way; although he had never lifted weights, he had worked on farms, railroads, and other places which had made his body hardened and his hands calloused.

Shortly after I was born, he took a job at a printing plant that paid better so that he could afford to feed me, but as a result, he usually did not get home until long after I had fallen asleep.  He kept this job until I was about ten, so usually, I would see him in the morning when I woke up and that would be it for the rest of the day.  However, when he got home, he would always come in to my room, sit at the foot of my bed, and rest his hand on my shoulder.  I would wake up briefly, but having him close was comforting, so I would usually fall asleep again shortly afterward.

One night when I was six, I was having trouble sleeping.  It was some time in the spring, I believe (my memories are hazy) but it was usually hot, and so I kicked my covers off and lay on my back, basking in the uncomfortable humidity.  As I lay there, half-awake, I felt a large, rough hand press on my chest.  I stirred- it was an unusual position for my father's hand- but I just smiled and did not open my eyes.  I lay still for probably about ten minutes, the comfort of my father's presence not doing its normal job of comforting me to sleep.  It was at this point that I noticed the heavy breathing.  It sounded labored, almost wheezing, definitely not what I was used to.

""Dad?"" I whispered.  Immediately, the hand on my chess began to press harder.  ""Dad?"" I whispered again, and again the hand pressed painfully harder on my chest.  I clenched my eyes shut, gritting myself against the pain.  I realized that the breathing had stopped, although the pressure on my chest remained.  After an eternity of summoning up my courage, I opened up my eyes.

The face hovering a few inches over mine was not my father's.

He clearly hadn't cleaned himself recently; he had long, course stubble, as well as unkempt hair, both the same shade of yellowed white.  His nose was flattened, almost like a cartoon who had run into a wall.  It, along with his thick, bushy eyebrows, would have been comical were it not for his eyes.  They were dark, although I couldn't make out the exact shade in the blackness of my room, and they were filled with the most intense, raging loathing I had ever seen and ever have seen.

My eyes clamped shut as hard as they could, and I began to cry.  With each sob, the pressure on my chest grew again.  His wheezing soon started again, coming harder and faster every time he pressed harder on my chest.  It went on for what felt like hours, until I could barely breathe.

Just before I passed out, I heard the doorknob to my room turn and footsteps, and just like it had begun, it was over.

When I woke up in the hospital, my parents explained to me that somehow, one of my lungs had collapsed in the night.  It was a rare condition that had caused it, unprecedented to show up in someone this young, with no symptoms; it was strictly the sort of things that happened to the elderly.  As they left me to soak his in, a doctor entered, bearing an assortment of pamphlets on taking care of your differently-abled child, and explained to my parents and me all the things that I wouldn't be able to do now because of the accident.

For years, as I grew up, I resented the other children who weren't like me.  I still do, even in my old age. I hate to even look at young folks now; I resent their ability to run, to play, to laugh, even to breathe without trouble...

Because ever since the accident, I have been left with a rough, scratchy wheeze.",nosleep,stripmymind,/r/nosleep/comments/fszit/my_father_was_a_large_man/

96,Remember the thousand yard stare? I just experienced it.,1298668655,"A couple of days ago, I read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fq1y0/the_thousand_yard_stare/) lovely story. ""I gradually became aware that I was staring into the empty eye sockets of a pale face, low to the ground, peering in at me from outside the door."" That line sent chills down my spine. I often find myself mindlessly staring off into the distance, and this morning, I got to experience something horribly similar. 

When I was younger, I was always scared of taking showers in my parent's bathroom. It was a long, narrow room with a shower at the end. Everything about it made me nervous. I'm extremely creeped out by cracks - doors, cabinets, closets, or drawers opened just enough to create crack peeking into the darkness inside. Whenever I took a shower, I first made sure all of the bathroom drawers and cabinets were closed. I would also shut the clothes hamper and put a towel over it, so I wouldn't be able to see the crack from the lid. Even after I closed everything, I would peek outside the shower every minute or so just to be sure no one or nothing else was in the bathroom with me. For some reason, maybe from one to many horror movies or my love of scary stories, I was positive one day someone or something was going to creep out of that darkness.

I now live in a small apartment, and the bathroom is much better. I still make sure to shut the cabinet doors before taking a shower, but I'm not worried about anything actually happening. This morning wasn't different from any other. I woke up late for class and jumped in the shower. I wasn't fully awake yet. I stared blankly at the shower wall as I washed my hair. I placed the tube of conditioner of the wire shower rack, and it fell through to the floor. As I leaned over to see if it had accidentally fallen into the trashcan, I began to pull back the curtain. Before I even had a grip on it, the lower corner of the curtain began curling up. My first thought was a breeze, but then I saw it. My heart stopped, I couldn't scream, and every nerve in my body was struck with pure fear. A face... slowly creeping out from behind the moving curtain as I stood helplessly frozen in fear. I thought, ""this is it, I'm going to die. I've let my guard down, and now it's here.""

The few seconds I spent staring at this face seemed to last forever. It was then that I recognized my killer. My boyfriend. He loves scaring me, but he's never been this successful. Fast asleep in the other room, I never expected him to come into the bathroom. Not being fully awake, it took a few seconds to realize who it was. Luckily, my first reaction to death isn't punching it in the face! Instead, I hid my face and broke down crying.

99,Shriek ,1298663950,"I think I’m calling in to work tomorrow. I need to stay away for a while. I heard the rumors. I heard the stories. Nothing like this, though. Not what happened tonight.  I feel like I need to explain a little more. Where to start?

I work for a museum. A collection of old suits of armor, weapons, and personal effects. Things people lived with. Things people died with. I always honor the deceased, but sometimes, it’s not enough. The museum has an entire level dedicated with things loaned from the Tower of London, the royal dungeon. Sometimes I feel like there is more than armor down there. It has always given me an odd sensation, passing through that level. Sometimes, the museum is quiet, and I will walk though, all alone.  It’s always cold there. Summer or winter, it is always cold. Not a chill, but freezing the marrow of your bones, bringing a shiver up your spine, icing your joints. Piercing, like one of the swords from the galleries is slowing working it’s way into your flesh, under your warm skin with its cold steel. Sorry, I tend to get a little carried away.

Matt, one of the security guards, is the closest to my age at the museum. He has a really laid back attitude and is generally the easiest to talk to. We’ll sit and chat about movies, video games, sports, you name it. He has been acting strangely the last week. I don’t blame him. He’s seen it too. He is the one who warned me.
“Watch out upstairs, man” he said to me last week. “When the lights turn off, I can hear something up there.” I laughed at first. I thought it was a joke.  All the guards have told me about the infamous “3rd floor ghost” many times, but it’s just a way to keep the guests guessing, and adding some suspense. Still, it did send a shiver down my back, as if someone was breathing hot vapor on my neck.

A storm hit us last night. Obsidian clouds pouring liquid ice onto the city. Didn't help the uneasy feeling I had that whole day. Like someone was churning my stomach. We have a new girl, who hasn't figured out the computer programs yet, so I stay later to help her. It's five fifty, and her computer is still frozen up. I decide that I can handle it, and I wish her well into the wall of gray water outside, falling from the sky.

By now, it is pitch black outside. Downtown is shut down. I can barely see the midnight oil from the upper levels of some other buildings. It could be mistaken for one in the morning. I finish up, and decide to head out. The stairs are alarm activated, so I have no choice but to take the elevator. The building is void of a light, so dark I can barely see the small lit button with the small down arrow. They didn't know I was up there when they turned off the lights. I hear the metal creaking as the elevator climbs the building. I start to hear something else.

It's behind me. Far away, at least thirty feet, but it's there. I take a deep breath and decide I am going to ignore it. I hear it take a deep breath followed by a long, low sigh.  It sounds like air leaving weak lungs, traveling though broken vocal chords. Somehow, I think that pressing the button again and again will make the elevator arrive. I hear foot steps. Slow, deliberate steps, with the heels dragging along the concrete floor. The sighs are louder, and becoming faster. I welcome the ""ding"" of the elevator as I dash on board, swipe my pass and slam ""B"". The doors jolt shut as I hit the close button repeatedly. I give a sigh of relief. The elevator is bright, and warm. I laugh at myself for being such an idiot. It was probably Matt doing rounds, I think to myself. 

""**Ding**""

I take a step out of the elevator, ready to head to the staff door. But I'm not in the basement. The digital letters above the elevator doors read 3. My legs tremble as I fly back into the elevator. As much as I press, the doors do not close. The noise I heard next will stay with me until I die. A sheik echoes from the back of the floor. It sounds like a woman in fear, and an animal in pain. It makes my heart feel hollow, and my stomach like it was made of lead. I cannot move. The light of the elevator gives a small glow as is shines onto the floor. I see a figure, off against the back wall. It quickly drops to the floor, and begins to crawl towards me. Crawl isn't the right word. Crawling is natural. This was fast. I can see it's limbs moving in contorted ways as it sprints towards me. I cannot move. I shut my eyes. There is nothing more I can do.

My pass

I forgot to swipe my pass. I quickly swipe the buttons into activation. I can't reach the basement without my clearance pass. My eyes were shut, so I don't know how close it got before the door closed. I am embraced in warm light again. I don't open my eyes until the doors open again, and I run out into the security console, where Matt is on duty. I start to laugh, and finally open my eyes. I felt like such an idiot for being so scared. I look up at him, and I stop laughing. He is as pale as snow, and staring right past me. I freeze, as the doors slowly close behind me. I don't look back, but I hear it, the cracked breathing in the elevator behind me. The scratching on the elevator door. The chill.

1,The Man in the Attic,1298661807,"When I was 14 years old, I did what many my age do to earn a bit more cash, I babysat for friends of my parents. It was in November when my father introduced me to a new coworker of his, Mr. D. The D's were new to town and needed a sitter to watch their 4 year-old daughter Rachel while they attended a function at the college my dad and Mr. D taught at. I needed the money and had nothing planned that night anyway, so I agreed.

The D's new home was a brick red Victorian-style house at the end of a windy cul-de-sac on the other side of town. The school I went to was a couple streets over, but despite my extensive exploration of the town on my bike over the years, I'd never actually been down that street.

I remember the wind was really frigid and starting to pick up when I finally got there on my bike early that evening. The sun hadn't gone down yet, so the house seemed rather innocuous. They had about a half dozen garbage bags full of leaves at the curbside, and their lawn was pretty immaculate. There was a big oak tree in the front yard that obscured most of the upstairs windows.

I was given the usual tour of the ground floor: kitchen, living room, dining room, bathroom, etc., along with a quick stop in Rachel's bedroom to show me her laid out pajamas and favorite books to have read. The D's wrote down a number I could reach them at (this was before cell phones were common place) and the emergency numbers, even though I had those memorized already. Then they put on their jackets, kissed Rachel goodnight and left.

Most of the evening was uneventful. The D's had bought a frozen dinner for me to microwave when Rachel got hungry, and Rachel was quite happy making her stuffed animals perform skits for my entertainment while I tried to get my homework done. It was later, while Rachel was drawing pictures with her crayons, that things got weird.

First, it was an old house, and with the wind outside, things creaked a lot. It was blowing so hard you could hear it howling through the windows. I was worried the noises would scare Rachel (I was already feeling anxious myself), so I kept trying to reassure her that it was just the wind and the house, and don't be scared. She just shrugged and said she wasn't. What a trooper. I was sitting on the floor, leaning back against the couch and Rachel was knelt by a coffee table with her crayon box and a pad of paper. I stopped reading and listened to the creaks and groans of the house. It almost sounded like someone was moving upstairs, walking around in the room above us. I tried to ignore it by playing with Rachel. She loaned me a piece of paper and I tried my best to draw a kitty. She was doing scribbles and spirals, the typical 4 year-old's drawing. I asked her what her drawing was of.

""That's me, that's mommy, that's daddy, and that's the man in the attic,"" she said.

I was taken aback.

""The man in the attic?""

""Uh huh.""

""*Your* attic?""

""Uh huh.""

I looked over at the stairs to the second floor and got prickles on my neck.

""Does the man in the attic have a name?"" I asked nervously. I was hoping this was just an imaginary friend she was talking about.

""I don't know,"" was her reply.

The conversation was making me tense, so I decided it all a game she was playing and went back to drawing, but not before I had moved so I didn't have my back to the stairs. Rachel just hummed and finished her drawing, smiling brightly as she presented it to me to keep. Afterward, she went back to playing with her stuffed animals. My ears seemed more highly sensitive now, listening to every creak of the house and whistle the wind made. Then I started paying attention to Rachel and her animals.

""What are you doing?"" Rachel had her teddy bear ask the tawny cat in a deep voice.

""Looking for a spare pillow!"" squeaked the tawny cat.

""I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH MY THINGS!"" bellowed Rachel loudly and then the teddy bear smacked the tawny cat on the head. I flinched at the sudden violence, even though they were just toys. Rachel didn't stop... the bear kept hitting the cat as she made it yell ""HOW-MANY-TIMES-DO-I HAVE-TO-TELL-YOU-TO-STAY-OUT-OF-MY-THINGS? THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME!"" I stopped her quickly.

""Rachel!"" I yelled, shocked. She was taken by surprise. ""Did you hear that conversation somewhere?""

Rachel hung her head down, looking at me, hugging the teddy bear, then cast her eyes upward toward the ceiling briefly.

""Mommy and daddy?"" I asked anxiously.

""No...""

I bristled. ""The man in the attic?"" I realized I was whispering. Rachel looked at me quietly, her chin still down, and nodded briefly. The house suddenly felt infinitely more inhospitable. It was like at that moment, the walls started leaning in toward us. No more than a second after Rachel nodded, there came a creaking right over our heads and we both jumped. The lights flickered and Rachel ran into my arms. It felt like my heart was in my throat. Despite the fact that all my courage had just fled, I felt it was my duty as the protector to make sure the house was safe.

""Do you know where Mommy and Daddy keep a flashlight?"" I asked Rachel. She showed me where one was kept in the kitchen. I turned on the television for her and she quickly forgot all her worries and sat down in front of it, mesmerized.

I made my way cautiously up to the second floor, turning on every light along the way. Rachel's room was just to the left at the top of the stairs, the bathroom beside it. To the right was some sort of study, a closed door that I think was the master bedroom, and then a long hallway that ended at an unpainted wooden door that I immediately assumed was the door to the attic. First, I checked Rachel's room. I found a wiffle bat and brandished it for protection as I made my way down the hall to the attic door.

The door opened to a set of stairs that curved immediately right, and ended at a drop down door that I had to double over and get my back under to push up and open. It opened to darkness, so I flicked on the flashlight. It was a weak beam, but it was better than nothing. I peeked my head up into the attic and held aloft my wiffle bat and flashlight, scanning the area. There seemed to be limitless cobwebs and dust everywhere. The wind howled harder and I about gave up right there to fast walk my ass back to the living room, but something caught my eye. I went up into the attic.

In the farthest corner of the room was a large trunk, about two feet high with a curved top. It looked just like a movie pirate's treasure chest. There was a padlock on the latch, but it wasn't closed, so I set down the bat, took the padlock off and opened the chest. Inside were a bunch of bundled up, filthy clothes and a small stack of bound books that looked like journals. I held the flashlight over the chest as I rummaged slowly through the clothes. My grip fell on something heavy wrapped in a stained oilcloth. As I picked it up, the cloth fell away... it was a big iron wrench.

That's when the trunk slammed shut like someone had thrown their entire weight against it. If it hadn't been for the flashlight I was using to see, I might have lost some fingers. Instead, the lid banged hard on the flashlight and I jerked both hands back. It was suddenly really dark, what with the flashlight half stuck in the trunk, and I was scared shitless, so I bolted for the hole in the floor, where I could see a sliver of light from the downstairs hallway. As I hit the bottom step, the drop down door slammed shut as hard as the chest had. I threw the hallway door shut behind me and bolted for the stairs and back down to the living room, where I grabbed Rachel and hugged her tight to me and curled up on the sofa together. I held her tiny body against mine for the rest of the evening. Eventually, I felt her fall asleep in my arms. Despite my adrenaline rush earlier, I started to feel overwhelmed with grogginess.

We were both sound asleep when Mr. and Mrs. D returned. Mr. D carried her off to bed while Mrs. D paid me and asked the usual questions as to how things went. Mr. D came back downstairs as I was heading for the door. I couldn't wait to get out of that house.

""Oh, I'm sorry,"" I said, stopping in the doorway, ""I thought I heard a noise in the attic, so I went to look. I think I left your flashlight up there.""

Mr. D got a strange look on his face.

""Are you joking?"" he asked.

""No..."" I said with pause, ""why?""

""The attic's been locked tight since we moved here,"" he explained. ""The door has a bolt that's been set from the inside and the Realtor couldn't find a key for it.""

He and his wife looked at each other and then at me. They were both frowning. Mr. D went into the kitchen and a minute later returned to the front door. In his hand was the flashlight. He looked at Mrs. D again, then at me, and I saw it in his expression... amusement mixed with incredulity.

""Somebody had a bad dream,"" he said condescendingly.

I tucked up my bottom lip, shrugged my backpack over my shoulder and got on my bike. As I pedaled away, something made me glance over my shoulder. Through the branches of the oak tree, the attic window was dark, but in the second I looked, there seemed to be a shift in the blackness, as if some dark shape was moving away from the glass. I spent the bike ride home convincing myself that what I had seen was a reflection of the moon.

2,Sunset,1298654152,"I stood upon the edge of night, on a bluff in a local park. My car was idling behind me, and I was looking out over the vast view the height advantage afforded me. Dark trees stretched out over rolling hills to the horizon and beyond. The sun, orange and huge, wavered with atmospheric interference as it illuminated the sky with a mixture of orange, red and pink. I could see it moving, see it drowning in the horizon as it descended, as the night came ever closer. Twilight and its dusky shadows gave me enough light to see what crept on the ground below, things I'd rather not describe. They waited, swimming in the ocean of the forest of shade.

Only a sliver of the sun was left now. Instead of fright, I felt a peaceful calm come over me. I knew my running was over. The sky was dark blue now, with only a bit of orange left in the west, and the first few stars were beginning to scintillate in the dark dome.

The sun set. Instead of leaving a trace of light for a few more minutes, the skies went pitch black. My car's headlights were the only light remaining, sweeping the edge of the bluff with pale electric yellow. I could hear them swarming up the bluff, climbing it with unworldly speed. The headlights of the car broke, their filaments snapping in death, and the engine sputtered out shortly thereafter. I held my hands to the sky, closed my eyes, and waited.

There was horrendous, agonizing pain, and then nothing. Darkness reigned supreme.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fsnis/sunset/
3,Sleepless Night,1298651836,"Edit: I'm rewriting a few things because I see I made a lot of grammatical mistakes and some things aren't clear. I'm not changing the story. Also adding more description. 




Everything started out like my night normally does. I did my homework, squeezed in a few extra minutes on the computer, and then said goodnight to my dad as I walked upstairs to go to sleep. I shut my door, turned off the lights and turned on the fan next to my bed. I like the white noise, I can't sleep without it.

My dream started out normally, well, as normal as a dreams are . Soon, however, the dream morphed into a twisted vision. Everything was elongated, far away. It was as if I was looking at the dream through a fish-eye lens. Everything anyone said in it became long. That's the only way I can describe it. They would say what they needed to, but continued on to discuss something else; stalling. They would pause and begin to stare stare into me; staring at the real me. And then there were the flashes. Mid stare, I would see a sort of...""out of body image"" of myself lying in bed. Only I wasn't alone. A creature was in the bed with me, wrapped around me. The creatures was tall, dark, and lanky. It's torso, arms, and legs, were very stick like. It's head, however, was circular and right against mine. It had small hands with long nails. The nails were wrapped around front of my face as it straddled me. This creature was Long, like the dream. These flashes continued, interrupting the long dead stares of their doll like eyes. 

As the dream went on I felt myself becoming more and more nauseous. The more flashes there were, and the more the people in my dream stared at me, the more nauseous I became.

 I actually woke up from the overwhelming need to vomit. As I sat up in bed, I saw something I don't think I'll forget for a while. I could see a sort of... curled up tail... move across my room. I only saw it because the hallway light peeked through the crack between my door and the wall. The tail moved across the light and then dissipated into the darkness. I jumped to my bedside table to turn the light on but when I did, nothing was there. I ran to the bathroom and immediately threw up. I felt so sick. I chugged a bottle of water and washed out my mouth. 

I went back to bed. I was so anxious I couldn't fall asleep. I eventually drifted off and I didn't have any more visions of monsters in my bed, and the dream proceeded at a normal pace. But my throat stung. 

When I woke up this morning I discovered that I was covered in scratches. Sets of three or four... thin... long....scratches. 

[Here's a picture of the Scratches](http://i.imgur.com/0meGG.jpg) They're a little hard to see. They're on the bottom of my neck and head to the shoulder. ",nosleep,Nixpix66,/r/nosleep/comments/fsml5/sleepless_night/
4,Slenderman was stalking me,1298649954,"This happened last night, so most of it is 100% true, and I was pretty freaked out about it.

Recently I have gotten into Marble Hornets [if you have not seen it watch it NOW - it's awesome], and the idea of Slenderman, a tall being with abnormally large limbs and jet-black figure is freaky to say the least. In fact, I was slightly obsessed more than creeped out, and wanted to believe that such a being existed, don't ask why.

The first thing I remember was running in a deserted town, like an apocalypse had occured months before. Rusted fences and houses torn apart, rubble and metal scraps littered the streets and alleys. I turned around every so often, and would feel the strangest presence nearby. Someone or something was watching. I ran down the nearest alley, I heard faster footsteps close behind. As I looked back I saw nothing, nothing was following me. Yet I continued to sprint with heavy footsteps, until somehow I ended up on the roof of a garage. I looked around, the street I had left behind was empty and silent. I thought I had escaped my stalker.....until I glanced over the gardens into a kitchen window about 200 yards away. A black shadow quickly moved out of view, still in that house. I knew it saw me, and I knew there was knowhere to hide, it would always find me. My reaction was simply jumping down and smashing through the front door of a nearby house. Inside I stumbled around, hoping to escape elsewhere. Instead, by chance, I ran into a survivor, a survivor of whatever the hell happened to the place. They said nothing, we were both on the floor after being knocked down. I gathered my breath and glanced back at the front door. There it was.

A tall, freakish creature stood there, faceless, yet still staring at us from the doorway. I was frozen, the survivor was frozen. The figure did not make a move either. In an attempt to feel even the slightest bit dominant, I ran towards it in hopes of tackling it down and making myself threatening. However, I hit it like you would if you were a child running at someone older. It just looked down at me, never breaking the stare. I backed away outside, the survivor had made a run for it. The final moments of this nightmare I remember pulling out my phone in an attempt to photograph evidence if I were to vanish from this abandoned world.

I woke up, slightly panicked, but more relieved that I was dreaming. Even after all that had happened, I was still fascinated by Slenderman, but the truth behind him is still hidden. I got up feeling somewhat refreshed, and felt good about things.

Then I looked at my phone.",nosleep,RoastBeef94,/r/nosleep/comments/fslu2/slenderman_was_stalking_me/

7,Footsteps in the corridor,1298625238,"This isn't really no-sleep stuff. I'm not terrified or anything. But it's true, and I thought I'd get it off my chest.

I work in a small office in Duxton Hill in Singapore, on the top two floors of a small shophouse. 

(If you don't know what a shophouse is, well, [they look like this](http://www.google.com.sg/images?q=shophouse&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1SKPC_enSG355&amp;prmd=ivnscm&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbs=isch:1&amp;ei=Im5nTdGoJIrrrQf57_3aCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CBcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=629) and [this is what Wikipedia says about them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shophouse). It's basically a townhouse that's set up along the sidewalk/pavement/five-foot-way, where the ground floor is a shop and the living quarters are upstairs. See, you're learning stuff already.)

Anyway, these shophouses are old. They're conserved buildings, heritage listed, and have a lot of history. This group is just off Chinatown, and represents what would have been part of the centre of old Singapore, due to its proximity to the port. An old building, by Singaporean standards, with lots of history. But it's been conserved, zoned for commercial use, and like many others along this stretch, is all modern now. It's fitted out as an office (much like any other) except that the floor plan matches the original building. There's a fancy patisserie that occupies the first floor, a small two-man law firm on the second floor, and my company's at the top two floors. One floor has our consultants and a meeting room, and another one has our managing partner's office, a smaller gathering room, and seats some of our support staff. Both floors consist basically of one large room in the front connected to a smaller room at the rear by a long passage/corridor, and the rooms and corridor wrap around a central air-well in a sort of letter C shape.

Now there's nothing really spooky about this building, really, but we're convinced it's haunted. When I stay back late at night, I hear the floorboards creaking like someone's walking up and down. It's either the old wood settling, or the uneasy spirits of the former residents of this place, wandering about. I usually don't pay it any attention.

We have windows that open by themselves, usually with a loud pop, and we've gotten used to ignoring them. There's a cold tap that occasionally gives us very warm water for no apparent reason, and I suppose the pipes are old.

One night, we stayed back late to prepare for a client event in the morning. Had to get everything printed up and ready to carry to the venue in the morning, so I was some of my team mates making sure that everything was good to go. We were just about finished up. Rosie, our most junior staff member (*not her real name), said she wanted to go, so we let her head off first, and told her we'd lock up. Shirley and Denise were packing up their things, getting ready to go home. I had to pee, so I went to the toilet, right at the back of the building.

As I stepped out of the toilet after relieving myself, I saw a woman in black step into the back room. Neither Shirley nor Denise was wearing black that day, so I assumed it was Rosie. I said ""Hey, Rosie, I thought you'd left - did you leave something behind?"" - bit of a silly question since her work station wasn't in the back room. I stuck my hand in, turned on the light, and ... and there was no one in there.

Just my imagination.

I shut off the light, and went out to the front room, where Shirley and Denise told me about how the projector in the meeting room had turned itself on. We decided the wiring in the building was old, so it was probably a surge or something. I asked them if Rosie had come back, and they said she hadn't. I decided not to worry them, so I said nothing about the woman I'd seen in the black dress (so quickly, so fleetingly, walking into the back room).

We shut everything off, locked up, climbed down the stairs and went home. Like I said, I'm not terrified, and I don't have any trouble sleeping, but I try not to stay too late, or stay back alone.",nosleep,fragile_ego,/r/nosleep/comments/fsg0r/footsteps_in_the_corridor/

11,"Wow, it's really raining hard outside",1298612816,"I've been watching the storm front roll in on the Weather Channel for a few hours now. Apparently there were tractor trailers being blown off the road in Arkansas, so this should be a whiz-banger by the time it gets to me. The weather man is calling for straight-line winds of 70 miles per hour, with gust of 80-90. I'm not too worried though - this house has been here for almost 150 years, and I'm sure that it's seen worse than this little squall. Besides, I have plenty of candles for when the electricity inevitably goes out and a chainsaw to clear the driveway, if necessary, in the morning. A country boy can survive, indeed! When you live as far from civilization as I do, preparedness is a way of life. 

I just heard the first peal of thunder! I love it. I love storms. They're so raw and elemental. I love feeling the thunder in my chest and watching the lightening explode in the sky. I love the wind and the rain-smell and the ozone and the darkness. Although I've never been on a ship in the middle of the ocean, I'd bet it's like this. I should go sailing someday...

First, I should probably go back inside. Standing on the porch has kept me mostly dry, but the wind is picking up and the rain is starting to go sideways, and who the hell wants to be soaking wet if the electricity goes out? It's already starting to flicker, probably due to the wind. Also, I don't want a repeat of The Incident from high school. Seriously, you'd think that getting struck by lightning once would teach you not to stand in puddles during thunderstorms.

***

The house is really groaning now. Holy crap, that wind is strong! I expect that tonight will be a tornado night. I can't really say for sure because the cable went out about 15 minutes ago. I suppose I'll have to rely on old-fashioned methods for checking the weather (i.e. sticking my head out the front door) until the cable decides to start working again. The electricity's still fading in and out, and it's wreaking havoc on my appliances. The refrigerator keeps turning on and off - great for the motor, I'm sure - and the heat comes on for about three minutes before the power goes out again. I suppose I should just turn it off so I don't burn out the fan motor or something, but it feels like the temperature has dropped about 10 degrees. It's bloody cold in here!

The stupid lamp in my mom's room keeps coming on too. It's one of those touch-based models that you have to tap to turn on so I suppose one of the dogs has been brushing against it trying to find a place to hide. Poor things - they hate storms, and they've been really agitated for the last hour or two. They've been stuck to me like glue so I'm not really sure when they'd've had the chance to go in mom's room, especially considering that the door's been closed since she moved out last year, but that's the only explanation for the light. Ugh. I hate going in there. Her goddamn doll collection is stacked up to the ceiling and those little fuckers freak me out. All those little glass eyes just staring at you. Unblinking. They smell like dust and decay. I know she's been collecting them for years but I really wish she'd get rid of them.

Stupid dogs. They know they're not allowed in that room. I really, really hate going in there to turn off that stupid lamp. I'm going to put the dogs in their kennels. I know they'll hate me but I can't deal with them tonight.

***

Yup, the tornado sirens in town start sounding right as the electricity went off. Time to move down to the root cellar, I guess. I suppose I should also conserve my laptop battery so I should probably stop typing...

***

UGH. DAMMIT. My lighter is out of butane and I don't have any matches. Smart, man, real smart. What the hell good is a candle if you can't light it? At least I can use my laptop as a lamp, at least until morning. It'll be at least that long before the electricity comes back. I heard a transformer blow earlier and those of us out here in the sticks are always the last ones to get serviced. Jesus. The explosion scared the shit out of me too. Even down here in the root cellar, I could hear it as clear as day. 

Also, we have fucking mice. I shouldn't be surprised since the coyotes killed all our cats a few weeks ago, but there ya go. I haven't actually seen them but I can hear little footsteps scurrying around on the floors above me. The dogs hear them too - every few minutes they'll perk their heads up and start whining. I know, girls, I know. I hate those little bastards too.

***

This storm keeps getting worse. I can't believe it. I've never experienced anything like this - the whole house is vibrating from the wind and the thunder sounds like artillery. And those stupid fucking mice are having a field day up above me. It sounds like there are rats there too; those pitter-patters are definitely bigger than mice. This fucking sucks. The cellar door won't shut completely so every few minutes it'll open just enough to let in some wind and some rain, and I have to go over and close it back. Me and the dogs are stuck in the one little dry corner farthest from the door, trying to stay dry. The dogs are really freaked out now, and they keep randomly having barking fits. Though I can't see them because the only light in this goddamn cellar is the glow from my laptop monitor, I assume that they're barking at the rats I hear moving around just off in the darkness. First thing I'm doing tomorrow is buying as much poison as humanly possible. I want these little fuckers dead.

***

Holy shit. Holy fuck. There are so many of them. I can see their little eyes glinting in the dark. Fuck me, they're stacked to the ceiling and staring at me. What the fuck do they want? The dogs are trying to hide behind me, but I'm backed against the wall. I’d rather be out in the storm but all those fucking eyes in the dark are between me and the door. Jesus fuck, there are so many of them, glinting like glass beads. They're huge. They're looking at me. My laptop battery is almost dead. It's giving me a shutdown warning. Oh fuck, what am I going to do???

17,The Crystal Egg,1298605829,"When my wife and I got married, we spent our honeymoon in Honduras. While we were there, we did the usual purchasing of mementos and postcards to give to loved ones. It was in a small shop that sold curios and knick-knacks that my wife found an exquisitely crafted, crystal egg. When she showed it to me, I knew it would be a perfect gift for my mother, who had a modest collection of little crystal sculptures. Looking through the egg, most everything was a blur, but I could make out the shapes of people walking by and my new wife smiling at me.

My mother was in her eighties, under the watchful eye of a good live-in nurse ever since my father had passed away. She lit right up when she unwrapped the egg we had brought back for her. She held it up to the open window and the room was filled with tiny rainbows from the light refracting through the crystal. I felt like a good son.

Weeks later, we got a call from Ms. Fieldman, my mother's nurse. She didn't want to alarm us, but was concerned that my mother may be beginning to show signs of Alzheimer's disease, or possibly dementia. She explained to me how she had overheard my mother talking in another room, and peeked in only to find my mother holding the crystal egg up and talking to it. She called it ""John"", which was my father's name. We agreed that it might be a good idea to have my mother's routine checkup pushed up some so a doctor could see her sooner. A week later, Ms. Fieldman called again; the doctor had found nothing wrong with my mother.

The last time I went to see her, she was merrily humming to herself and going about her house, tidying things up as usual. Every now and then I'd see her get the crystal egg out of her pocket, hold it to her eye and look around with it. One time I watched as she smiled and then seemed to blow it a kiss before tucking it away and hurrying off. As we were getting our things together to leave the next day, I spied my mother tucking something into the pocket of my coat. I went over and pulled out the crystal egg.

""Mom, why are you trying to stash this on me?"" I asked.

""Oh I won't be needing it anymore,"" she said, and suddenly she looked very sad, but tried to hide it with a smile. ""But you're going to need it.""

""Mom, I don't--"" but she didn't let me finish.

""Hush now, and take it,"" she said and gripped my hand with the egg in it tightly.

The next day, Ms. Fieldman called to tell me the bad news: my mother had sneaked some extra sleeping pills into her room before bed, and had passed away long before Ms. Fieldman had gone in to wake her that morning. I let the phone drop, walked mindlessly into the den, took the crystal egg off the hutch where I had left it, hugged it to my chest and cried.

I spent the evening lost in the egg. I just held it up and looked through it at everything around me. Something about it had driven my mother insane, I was sure of it. All I could see was light and shadow; a dancing blob was the TV, a dark, flitting spot was my wife coming in to see how I was doing. I could see her shape in the doorway, watching me with sadness and concern, but when I looked up, she wasn't there. I went back to looking into the egg, determined to see what it was my mother saw. I closed one eye and pressed the crystal to the other so that everything directly in front of me was in clear focus, ringed by the haze of a million refracted images.

Nothing.

My work gave me a few days of bereavement leave which I spent unshaven, not leaving the house, just wandering inside, looking through the crystal egg. I was sleeping odd hours, spending my time sitting at the window watching people walk by outside. I distinctly remember one man who walked by very slowly, seemingly with no particular destination in mind. The expression on his face was dour and gray. He turned and looked at me and naturally got a confused expression on his face. He started to walk onto my lawn toward the window I was sitting at, and I closed the curtains on him. I could see his shadow through the curtain as he stood at the window. I stepped back, a little unnerved by his expression. I put the egg in my pocket and when I looked back at the curtains, he had apparently gone on his way.

I had been in almost a trance the past few days, but that weekend my wife helped me clean up, shave, get on my nicest suit, and drove us to the cemetery where my mother was to be buried. The car pulled past the cemetery gates and we crept down a small road toward the site for the funeral. As we turned past a crypt, I pulled out the crystal egg and pressed it to my eye to look at the things passing by. Just a few headstones away, I spotted a group of people standing together and nudged my wife.

""Over there,"" I said, pointing to where the people seemed to be congregating. We pulled over, and I got out, walking over to the group of people who were clearly dressed for a funeral.

""What are you doing?"" my wife asked from behind me. Several of the people looked up at us.

""What's wrong?"" I said, turning to look at her. She was frowning. *She's wondering why I'm looking through the egg*, I thought, so I put it in my pocket and took her hand.

""Come on,"" I said, turning back around.

The people were gone.

I stood there a second, confused. My head felt light and my hand trembled as I reached back into my pocket and took the crystal egg back out. I closed one eye and pressed the egg to the other. There were the people. And as slowly as the skin on my body had just started to crawl came the dawning recognition that these people were dressed for a different funeral-- their own. One tilted his head slightly and blinked. Two of the others began to walk menacingly toward me. Each one had an expression of curiosity on his or her face. My mouth went dry, and I turned quickly to get away, pulling my wife with me back toward the car.

They were everywhere. Some stood by their graves, others trudged aimlessly along the paths and the middle of the road. Most were oblivious to our presence, but even as I felt a scream welling up in my throat, they all collectively turned and looked in our direction and began to shamble toward us. I shoved my poor bewildered wife into the car, then got in, cursing at having to adjust the seat, started it up and gunned the engine, kicking up a mess of gravel. My wife was shouting at me but I couldn't for the life of me understand her. I rolled down the window as we passed the gates and hurled the crystal egg out of the car. We did not attend my mother's funeral that day.

I don't go by graveyards anymore. There's one on the route to our daughter's daycare, but I've found an alternate way to get there that avoids going past it. I know it doesn't do much good, but I breathe easier with the thought that maybe they can't pass beyond the gates. Sometimes, when the sun is out but the curtains are drawn, I'll think that I can see a shadow standing outside the window, trying to look in.",nosleep,wdalphin,/r/nosleep/comments/fsat8/the_crystal_egg/

19,It was about noon...,1298600323,"This happened a few years back. I had graduated college with a worthless Communications degree and I had a lot of spare time on my hands. I was working an awful ""job"" delivering pizza three nights a week and lived at my mother's house spending all my time praying that she wouldn't get sick enough of me to force me into a cubicle by withholding student loan payments. This fear would manifest itself in weird ways. I wouldn't eat too much out of the fridge, I'd never bring my few remaining friends around, and every day, without fail, I would pretend that I wasn't sleeping in past noon. She worked early hours, so my real fear was her coming home and finding me still in bed. What I would do is lock my door every night, so I'd at least have a few seconds warning to wake up and pretend that I had been up.

So that's how it all started, with a jingle of my locked door. I leaped up, I mean, I was really on edge about this whole not looking too lazy thing. My eyes darted to the alarm clock, it was around noon. She must have came home from work a few hours early. Then the door slammed, twice, like someone was slamming a shoulder into it. I said something like ""What? Hold on, alright?"" I got up, threw my jeans from last night on and crossed my room to the door. After I unlocked it and swung it open I saw the bathroom door slam. I figured the jig was up, and I was thinking up reasons why I overslept while I walked through the hallway past the bathroom into the kitchen. I could hear her rummaging around in there, rather loudly.

When I got into the kitchen I saw broken glass on the floor. It took me a few seconds to register. I had stepped in something wet in the hallway. It kind of blurs together here, but I think I looked at my foot and saw that the bottom of my sock had a dark red stain. Then I noticed the broken window over the door, and the drops of blood that led to my door and then across the hall to the bathroom.

I know this sounds dumb, but I didn't think ""Oh God! Break-In"", I thought, ""Mom got locked out."" So I went to the bathroom, knocked on the door and asked, ""Hey, are you okay?""

Any rummaging sound stopped.

I got halfway through repeating myself when the door swung open.  It was not my mother. What stood before me was a wreck of a human being. She was in a filthy bathrobe, which hung loosely open. She had nothing else on save plastic bags over her feet. I noticed her dirty sagging exposed chest first, and my gaze went instinctively upwards. One eye was milky white with cateracts, her hair was so filthy and grimy that it was immobile, her mouth hung open, exposing a mouth missing half of it's mossy teeth. I jumped backwards in shock, straight through my half opened door.

She started grabbing at me. She had wrapped her bleeding hand in toilet tissue and she was reaching at my face and the other one was going toward my crotch. I lashed out, and shoved her backward, she fell back into the bathroom and I tried to close the door but she was in the way. She had landed in a sitting position and kept grabbing at me, making no noise, just reaching for me. I kinda pushed at her with my feet until I could close the door. I held it shut, but she didn't try to open it, so after a little while I went and called the police. They found her in a pool of blood. When she fell backward she had hit her head on the corner of the sink counter and that had been enough.

It was really disturbing for me though.",nosleep,Kal-Lplus10,/r/nosleep/comments/fs8y2/it_was_about_noon/

21,Back to School,1298594397,"Growing up I was an only child of a single mom. My dad was killed in Vietnam and we had no family other than each other. We were very poor and I knew that so I never asked for anything and all the money I made from paper routes and the like I always just gave to my mom. I know it killed her to take it, but she did. We never really had Christmas or holidays but every year on the first day of school she bought me a brand new pair of red Chuck Taylor shoes. They would just be in our front hall on the morning of the first day back. She never made a big deal about it but I loved her for it. She died when I was 15. I dropped out of school, got a job on a farm and just went on with my life, never wearing a pair of red Chucks again.

Flash forward. I'm now 43 years old and single. I talked myself into attending some study sessions at the local community college so I can try and get my GED. Yesterday, on the morning of what would be my first study session, there was a pair of red Chucks in my hallway. I stopped, stared and dropped my glass of milk. I must have stood looking at those shoes for 10 min. When I finally broke my gaze I turned, slipped on the milk and broken glass, whacked my head on the door knob and was out cold.

I woke up about am hour later, sure I had dreamed the whole thing. But the shoes are still in my hallway. I think I might be losing it. I think I might literally be crazy. I mean, it had to be me that got the shoes, it had to.",nosleep,anonapost,/r/nosleep/comments/fs701/back_to_school/

23,First Night With My Wife; A Ghost Story.  I think.,1298588832,"This is a story of the first time I slept with my new wife beside me.  

We fell asleep, in love, tired, grateful for one another's company.  Her back was to me, and I had one arm under her head.  We were so content, so comfortable.  And we dreamed.

Sometime in the night I heard her calling my name.  ""Gerry,"" she said.  I felt her over me, her hand on my shoulder gently nudging me.  ""Gerry, I need you to wake up.""  I started to wake.  ""Gerry, please wake up.""  There was a tone of urgency in her voice that hurt me in my stomach.  I finally woke up. 

In the dark, I did not see her looking at me.  I did not see her waiting for me to wake up.  Instead, I saw her sleeping in the same position we'd fallen asleep in.  Her back was still to me.  My arm was still under her head.

For a while I wondered what was happening.  Then I heard a whimper.

She was wimpering.  And as I lay there her whimpering became pained.  The whimpering turned to weeping, then crying.  All of this happened in the space of seconds.

24,The Cabin - Day 2,1298588569,"New to the story? Find out how this all started:    
[Day 1](http://redd.it/frcw6)

The next morning was uneventful. Even though I had not gotten any sleep, I didn't feel very tired, if at all. I had gotten out of bed only to realize nature was calling...bad. Unfortunately, we only had an out-house at the time, so I quickly put on my sandals and raincoat since it was still a bit drizzly and headed outside. Even though it was morning, the surrounding woods still gave off an eerie feeling. The slight rain only added to this. Seemingly unphased by what transpired during the night (or maybe I just needed to take a leak real bad), I marched up to the out-house. On the way back down to the cabin, I ran over the previous night in my head, over and over. Only a kid at the time, I kept convincing myself that it was a nightmare, or I was simply hallucinating. I started thinking that maybe there was something in the room that was making shadows on the walls. I went back into the room, finding nothing. I managed to convince myself it was just a bad dream, nothing more.

The rest of my family had already started breakfast without me, but there was plenty of food left. As I was getting my plate filled, my mom asked me if I was alright. She is a natural worrier, but for her to ask this out of the blue was odd, even for her. I simply told her I had a bad dream due to the storm going on the whole night. She looked confused, and told me the storm had stopped maybe and hour after we went to bed. I second guessed her, but my dad assured me the storm ended. This only convinced me further that it was all a bad dream. A very lucid bad dream. Needless to say, I was feeling pretty relieved.

As soon as breakfast was over, my dad started unpacking the car to get the fishing gear. He had dedicated this afternoon/evening for catching some trout, and he was taking me with him. Father-son bonding. For the next few hours he was getting all the bait and tackle ready. Meanwhile, the Sun was out again in full force, so my cousins and I took to the lake in some inner-tubes. The lake was pretty still, but we didn't care. I was just laying back in the inner-tube, my eyes closed. I could hear my cousins splashing around right next to me. I felt my cousins foot kick against my leg, splashing water all over me. The water was a bit cold, so when it hit my Sun-warmed body, I freaked out. My cousins were right behind my head (my back was to them), splashing around still. How could she kick my leg? I asked her if she kicked me by accident, which she denied. I looked over the edge of my inner-tube where my legs were and looked into the water. The lake is not murky at all, so you could see all the way to the bottom in shallow water. I saw what looked like a black log, drifting.

It moved.

I kept looking as it twitched at one end. I told my cousins to check it out, and they saw it too. My younger cousin started freaking out and crying. I started paddling back to shore, my cousins coming with me. Whatever that thing was followed us. It was just drifting in the water right behind us. The rest of the family on the shore all heard us and rushed to the dock where we were headed. We all managed to get there safely and dry off, but that thing was still in the water. My dad checked it out, grabbing a net. He managed to catch whatever it was. He held it up, all of us gasping and looking at it, intrigued. It was a fish. A large, black trout. Something was clearly wrong with it though. Upon closer inspection, it was sick, almost dead. It gave off this horrid stench as well, something akin to rotting eggs mixed with skunk. Regardless, my dad killed it to put it out of misery. We didn't go back in the water for the rest of the day, instead choosing to enjoy the sunshine. My dad took the fish to the back of the cabin to gut it. What he found bothered him. The fish was rotting from the inside out, its eggs were jet black. My dad decided to throw it in the fire that was set up. By then he was ready to start fishing, and he dragged me with him on the boat.

By the time we had gotten to our spot on the lake it was already late afternoon. We were there
for a couple hours, so by the end of our fishing run the sun was starting to set. We were located at a small nook at one end of the lake, lilly-pads everywhere, forest surrounding us. I heard a sound in the forest and turned my head to look. Nothing there. I was still looking in the forest when the boat started rocking, like another boat had passed and the waves were hitting us. I heard my dad mumble, so I turned around.

He was gone. The motor wasn't running anymore. His fishing rod still cast off the side of the boat. I was freaking out. I had no idea what was going on. I started crying for my mom. The lake was calm too. I could see other boats in the distance, so I started screaming and shouting, hoping they would come. They didn't. I thought maybe my dad had fallen over the edge of the boat for some reason, so I started looking over the side hoping to see him (the water wasn't so deep in this section of the lake). Nothing. I looked over the side, instantly paralyzed, my mouth opening as if to let out a huge scream. Not a sound came out. What I saw terrified me. Hundreds of those damned black fish, drifting. I was horrified. I knew at this moment that I was next. Fearing for my life, I turned to sit back in the boat, right in the middle.

It was sitting where my dad would have been. The dark figure from the night before. Those white eyes staring right at me. I stared right back. I couldn't do anything else. It just sat there, no movement at all. Beginning to tremble, I closed my eyes as fast and as hard as I could, clenching them shut. I opened them again. The figure was gone, but I was still paralyzed with fear. I knew it was still there, somewhere. A chill went up my spine. I could feel it behind me. Somehow I willed myself to turn around and face it. I found myself looking at the forest again. Suddenly my dad asked me what I had heard. I turned back and there he was, reeling in his rod for the night. I told him it must have been a deer or something, secretly relieved to see him. He was pretty disappointed that neither of us had caught anything, so he decided to call it quits and we headed back. I never did tell him, or anybody else, what I saw.

We got back as it was getting dark. A roaring fire was set up in the fire-pit. I got out of the boat, letting my dad tie it down, and joined everybody else at the campfire. We made smores all night and had a great time. I managed to hide my feelings so nobody suspected anything was wrong. Whatever I saw was real. Something was going on.

25,The Face In the Window,1298587018,"A few years ago, my two friends and I were hanging out inside a car in front of one of their houses just talking. The two of them were in the front seat, and I was lying down in the back. It was getting late, approaching 3am, and one of my friends (we'll call him Lenny) mentioned how 3am was the witching hour. We then got on the topic of the supernatural. Lenny always saw himself as being sensitive to that sort of thing, and began telling us of his experiences. 

There was a lull in the conversation at one point, and it got very quiet. That's when it happened. My other friend, (call him Carl) was looking out his window and briefly saw a ghoulish face staring back at him. He turned to Lenny and asked, ""Did you see that?"" Lenny said he didn't, but said he heard a very breathy sound, like someone exhaling sharply and loudly at the same moment Carl saw the face. I was still lying in the back seat, and didn't see or hear a thing, and I hadn't exhaled like that.  Nonetheless, we were all spooked, and decided it was time to  drive around for a while. 

Carl's older brother passed away several years earlier. I got to thinking that it could have been him coming to scare us, to give us a taste of the supernatural. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fs4en/the_face_in_the_window/
26,The Walled City,1298585010,"The air was as thick as it always was in the tangled mess of the Kowloon Walled city. The restless residents of the massive thing were bustling through the narrow corridors that the settlement consisted of. Residences and merchant shops seemed to intertwine with one another, almost indistinguishable between themselves. There are many secrets in the walled city, arguably more secrets than there are residents to keep them...

“Empty the register!,” exclaimed a masked man as he planted the butt of his shotgun against Mr. Hao’s cheek with brute force. Mr. Hao’s cat hissed and clamored off the counter and disappeared into the confines of the disorganized stock. The intruder slammed a burlap sack on the worn counter with haste and pointed the business end of the gun at the small, bald head of the quiet shop owner. His eyes were shifty, scanning the room for any other movements or sounds.

With the iron gaze of the gun peering in his face, Mr. Hao managed to conjure a few soft blinks of his eyes. He could hear the exaggerated voices of a children’s Anime cartoon above the shop. He hoped desperately that his daughter was still upstairs, content with watching her show and would not come downstairs and observe her father standing in front of a gun. He almost wished he had the powers of some of the characters to remove him from this predicament, and at the thought of it, he released a soft chuckle.

Mr. Hao’s family had been through many tragedies, which was not uncommon for the people of the walled city. His wife had been killed by the fever not but three years ago. He emptied his pockets paying for pricey medicines that promised her recovery, but everything had failed. His daughter was born deaf, and he worried everyday for her well-being, this place took every fiber of a person’s being to survive.

The shelves of his quaint shop are lined with various types of items, from food to books. Trinkets are scattered around the area in a haphazard manner and assorted Buddha figurines and dragons lined the walls. A thin layer of dust covered the entire store. Mr. Hao had taped pictures of his daughter at various ages along the front of his old cast iron cash register. 

All in all, Mr. Hao’s shop was not unlike the others in the district, but he was well known for one thing and one thing only, his Pinyin soup. Some claim that it is better than any food found in the inner city. He had become almost a landmark attraction to what little visitors came to the Walled city. Though not by much, but this small trademark has earned Mr. Hao and his family enough money to be relatively comfortable. The downside to his windfall though, was that everyone in the tattered place wanted a piece of it too. Mr. Hao was robbed on almost a weekly basis.

“You heard me...empty the damn thing!,” the man rang out again as Mr. Hao was inserting his key in the register. A breeze wandered through the open door of the shop, rustling the bamboo plants and setting his wind chimes in motion. He could taste the blood in his mouth, and feel the smooth wind on his wound.  He forced himself to swallow the blood and compose himself in front of his attacker. He was silently praying as he stared into the crazed eyes of the thief. 

He opened the register and dumped the drawer into the sack, managing to produce a wry smile on his semi-wrinkled face. “Now, where is your safe?!,” the man screamed as Mr. Hao simply shrugged his shoulders in reply. “I know you have a damn safe, that can’t be all the money that you have!” The man’s movements were becoming more and more restless, it was obvious he was suffering from anxiety, and who wouldn’t in his situation, apparently he had heard the rumors...

A line of potted bamboo plants encased the outer area of Mr. Hao’s shop, and it was hard to see all of the nooks and crannies that are scattered there, it is understandable that a man would be hard pressed and nervous in such a situation, wondering if anyone would try to be a hero. 

Beads of sweat began to form on the man’s head, and his arms were beginning to shake from the pressure of trying to peer through the shroud of products and bamboo, and at one point he thought he could see eyes peering through at him from the top shelves, but he wrote it off and a figment of his imagination. He pointed his gun closer to Mr. Hao’s gentle face in his impatience. “Where do you keep your money then!?,” he yelled in desperation. Mr. Hao replied as calm as ever in a thick, broken English voice, “Ancient Chinese secret.”

A blur flew in the corner of the troubled man’s eye and he heard pots shatter and leaves rustle. He turned in an instant and fired a slug at the noise, but he could not see the gleaming metal of the harvest sickle, swinging silently onto the nape of his neck. The deadly blade all but severed his spinal cord. The man’s lifeless body fell silently onto the dusty floor of the storefront and spasmed as the life drifted from the husk. Mr. Hao quickly rounded the counter and closed the heavy iron door to the entrance, turning his makeshift open sign to closed.

Whistling an old limerick, he grabbed the dark handle of the sickle and pried it from the man’s lifeless neck, continued to wipe it  clean with a towel dangling from his belt, and placed it on the counter top. Gazing at the man’s body lying on the floor, he released a heavy sigh... “No one has ever stolen my money...such a pity.” He peered over the retainer wall and into the large vat that he kept his region-famous soup, “Ah, just in time...almost out,” he muttered under his breath. He grabbed the man by his heavy legs and began to drag him to the downstairs room, his kitchen, the bulk of his body bouncing off of every step. The sound of boiling water filled the air. A half dozen cats bounded from the top shelf to claim their prize.

Hours later, Mr. Hao emerged from his shower. He dashed his blood ridden clothes and into the burlap sack that the attempted burglar had brought with him, along with other unwanted products of his process. Leaning out of the backside of shop, he dropped the heavy bag down into one of the many refuse pits contained in the city.

The vapor of the fresh soup filled the air. The cats were mewling against the retaining wall, steadily awaiting their payment for their part of the scheme. Mr. Hao unlatched the door, flipped his sign, and walked to his stool behind the counter. He scooped out a bowl of his malefic concoction and placed it on the floor for the cats, just as the door rang and people began filing in. “Ah, welcome!” 

The unlucky criminal must have been wondering why the a certain few people refer the Mr. Hao as “Roushang”, the butcher.",nosleep,Krowbarticus,/r/nosleep/comments/fs3n7/the_walled_city/
27,The man in the screen,1298576965,"I need to know if anyone has experienced this. I am extremely close to throwing our television set out, as well as our computers. Let me start with some details:

My fiancé and I live in an old house that was renovated to multiple apartments in an old US city. The building is well over a hundred years old, and for a while, it was abandoned. The landlords haven't said much, but the house was in a terrible state of disrepair when they first got it, and they managed to make it, ""quaint"" to say the least.


Being in an older house, a lot of creepy things tend to happen. Old pipes bang, doors creak, and we can hear noises opposite ends of the house. Most of the time, we don't mind them. Recently, however, things have begun to affect our television. 

It started last month. The TV would turn on in the middle of the night. It scared the shit out of me the first time. I thought a well articulated burglar had broken in. It only happened a couple days, so I thought that one of us had triggered some auto start program.

Next week was much worse. Ellie started seeing things in the TV. She said a man was staring at her. He was faint, she said, like you could barely see him. But his figure was clear as day. She said it was every time the tv was on. He could be seen when the screen went dark. Just for fleeting moments between commercials and dark sets. I didn't believe her at first. My mistake.

I began to see him too. I started keeping the lights on, just so I could see him clearer. He never made any noise, but he was always there, just barely. I don't believe in the paranormal much. I believe everything can be explained. I decided to start trying to study it. I was sure the man was some glitch in the tv, or our cable provider. Someone had burned an image the a lens somewhere, or a frozen image in a studio. It began to increase in size though, which I could not explain. When Ellie saw it first, it was a full figure of a man, from the knees up. Now it is from the shoulders up. I can start to see eyes.

Last night, while at a friend's house, we decided to share the experience. She sat in front of the tv, to demonstrate where she was sitting when he first appeared. Jokingly, I leaned in behind her to see if they had the man in the screen as well. Ellie let out a yelp. She said she saw him. I quickly backed away, in both fear and relief that it was a technical error, something not specific to us. She began to laugh, exclaiming that she didn't see him, only that my reflection in the screen behind her made it appear that it was him, staring back. I saw her face turn white at her realization. My heart dropped into my chest.

I see him now, as I type this. Ellie is at her friend's house. She is terrified. I have blocked out all light in the room, in an attempt to block him out. I know he is behind me, even as",nosleep,VicePresidente,/r/nosleep/comments/fs0dw/the_man_in_the_screen/
28,Wrap,1298574715,"Sometimes, my mom says, you just need a strong man to wrap his arms around you. To make you feel like a real woman - like you're all his. Sometimes, my mom says, you just need him to hold you tight in his arms; a snake that won't harm you in any way. Sometimes, my mom is wrong.

Sometimes, the strong man comes from nowhere. Sometimes, he just appears from thin air on the night of February 22, 2011. Sometimes, his arms wrap around your neck and you cry for him to stop. Sometimes, he only guffaws at your requests and bites your neck, and tears a bit of flesh off. It's not enough to make you hurt, but enough to make him want more. 

Sometimes, the man scars you for life. He wraps his big, strong arms around you when you're asleep. Sometimes, you can't see a face. It's a deafening silence that comes from the caved in skull of that man.. but who are you to stop it? Sometimes, you need to go with the flow.

Sometimes, he stealthily walks behind you until you turn around to scream. The people around you on the street look at you like you're insane - some even ask if you need help. You tell them about the man. All the time, they ask you which.

31,Little Blue Boots,1298569934,"When I was a little baby, my mom's father died. Nothing horrific, just a simple passing.  He had a certain spot of affection for me because I was the first boy born into that side of the family in two generations. When I was born, he gave to my mom a small glass pair of blue boots. I think it could have been used as a coin jar or vase but she kept it for decoration. My mom was a cat lady, but he hated all the cats except one. Let's call her Jessie.

The night after his passing, around 2:30 AM, my mother hears an enormous crash from our kitchen (Mind you she's a night owl, so she didn't dream this or imagine it, simply walked into the next room). A wine cabinet in our kitchen had toppled over. There was nothing structurally wrong with the cabinet, it simply fell over. My mother said she felt a strange presence in the room. Two of our cats were hissing in the general direction of the glass, which was already unusual given how skittish cats are. Jessie was actually walking through the glass and sniffing the area! I was sleeping in the next room, and usually any tiny noise would wake me up, but this night I slept soundly, which already put my mom on high alert.

My mom was already freaked out, but then she surveyed the damage, and saw that every cup, wine glass, and ornament was broken....except for the little blue booties which had found their way unharmed onto our kitchen table. My mother says to the room ""Dad, You never talked to me in life, now leave me alone in your death!"" (Epic right?) And the presence left, and the cats ran to another room.

Now my mom was going to just let this story drop. But, her mom calls up the next day. She said to my mom ""Something very strange happened to me last night. Around 2:30, I woke up, and I just knew that your father was in the room with me. I said 'I love you, now be at peace.' And then he was gone.""

A little background about me and the boat first.  I was a nuclear trained electricians mate for six years in the navy.  This was my first and only sea-going duty station.  The boat was not exceptionally old, it was commissioned in 1983, the year after I was born.  To most of the people who I worked with it was well known for weird things happening, especially on the mid-watch, which started at midnight and ended at 6:00 in the morning.  On with the story.

It was a seemingly normal day on the boat, we were in port and trying to get all our maintenance done so we could all go home for the day.  One of the items on the list was to check the electrical interlocks on the main hotwells for the steam system.  These are just large heat exchangers with seawater flowing through tubes to cool steam and condense it so it can be pumped back into the boilers.  This is a larger undertaking than it sounds like.  We had at least eight people crammed into the tiny walk space in the area, not all of us were needed, but some of the newer guys were there to learn how it is done.  Everything was going fine for the first couple of hours, then shit started getting weird.  I was sitting on the deck doing something, I think I was recording results from the tests, but I had a good view of everything that was going on.  The first thing that happened seemed pretty mundane.  A pile of books sitting on top of a panel just fell, without anyone touching it, and the boat was not swaying either the whole time.  We didn't think much of this, even though the panel was larger than the books, and they were sitting in the center of it.  The next thing happened only a few seconds afterward.  I believe that I was the only one who saw it clearly.  One of the other guys, who was standing directly in front of me had a AA maglight in a holster on his belt.  I watched the flashlight jump out of the holster without being touched, land on the deck between my outstretched legs, roll under my right leg and jump over the inch-high ledge on the side of the deckplate.  Just after I watched that a  PDA which one of the other guys had sitting on the other side of the boat, on a similar panel to the one the books were sitting on, fell off as if it were pushed.  After this stuff quit I pulled up the deckplate to find the flashlight which fell into the bilge to find it at least three feet farther up the side of the bilge than where it fell, just laying there.  What makes this weird is that the bilge is curved, and the place it stopped was pretty steep.  I can find no way to explain how it could have even bounced up that far, much less stop there.  Then we discovered that the PDA was now missing its SD card.  It was found directly under one of the other deckplates.  It was about an inch below the deck perfectly balanced on a two inch pipe, which was about four inches from the edge of the deckplate.  Nobody could come up with an explanation for how it could have gotten there.  That was the part that creeped  us out the most.  As far as we could tell it would have been impossible for it to even reach that location, there was not even another pipe close to it for it to have bounced off of.  We finished the maintenance as quickly as we could after that.  We all had a similar WTF expression on our faces the whole time as we tried to figure out what had just happened.",nosleep,chadwickofwv,/r/nosleep/comments/frkww/my_experiences_aboard_the_uss_minneapolisst_paul/

I'm always swamped with school work, though.  I'm constantly up past midnight doing work, which isn't very enjoyable, but it has to be done.

Lately, I've been feeling watched.  I normally keep my blinds a bit open, so light can come in in the morning when I wake up for class.  
As I was walking to my bed, I felt the urge not to look outside.  As if someone was staring at me, waiting for me to notice them.  Waiting for me to realize that they were there, and were watching me.

I couldn't resist the urge not to look.  And truthfully, I wish I had.

There they were.  Three of them.  Whatever they were, they were not normal.  And I wish I could describe them, but the only detail that I can describe them as is dark.  I began to lose my breath as I realized that I was actually being watched by whatever these things were.  They weren't watching the house, or the people in it; they were watching me.

I immediately grabbed the cord and shut my blinds, imagining that if I could no longer see them, they'd simply go away.

I told myself that's what would happen.  That I was imagining it.  That nothing was there, and my eyes were tricking me, and that I'd give myself a bit to relax, then take another peak to calm me down.

I spent the next 30 minutes restlessly watching some entertainment show on tv, and decided it was time.

I leaned out of bed, and grabbed one part of a blind, and pulled up.

They were there.  In the same position.  With their heads angled up, staring directly into my eyes.  I nearly passed out, as I realized that this was real.  This was happening, and it was not going to stop by me closing my blinds and falling asleep.

I didn't get a moment of sleep that night, and I haven't gotten much in the past 3 weeks, since I learned that they were watching me.

It hasn't stopped, not one night.  They follow me everywhere.  Watching me.  I catch glimpses of the three of them standing in the distance, hidden behind some object that hides them from the public, knowing that I will eventually glance in the location they're standing. 

They don't move.  They never do.  

And to be honest, that's what scares me the most.  ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/frj3w/they_watch_me_everywhere_i_go/

===================================================================================

I went camping about 3 weekends ago in the Huntsville national forest in Texas. Me and 3 friends that came home for the weekend, they are all in college and usually we all get together at least once a year, old friends from high school. For the camping trip we planned to go backpacking deep in the forest, live off of fish that we catch and animals that we can trap. We have been doing this for awhile in Texas and in numerous places, Arizona, Colorado (if anyone is familiar with the Spanish peaks there), New Mexico, so we’re pretty much used to anything you’d encounter out there.

It was my turn to pick where we went camping, so I chose Huntsville (more accurately it s Huntsville/New Waverly). So we drive up there park our car in a camping park spot and start walking off into the forest. We had some laughs along the way everyone catching up with each other’s lives. We walked until it started to get dark and set up camp where we stopped. Everyone gathered wood to make a fire and we set our tent up. And we do what we always do: try and scare each other with weird stories.

Around this time we started to smell something very faint. It was noticeable but not overbearing. We couldn’t put our finger on what it was so we just carried on. Mike had to go piss and he walked off in the forest. A second later he comes running back, piss all down his jeans like he’d missed really bad. Immediately we all crack up and throw some jokes at him. Then we noticed that he was white as snow and trying to catch his breath. He starts screaming for us to follow him and runs off.

We all get serious and go follow him not knowing what the problem was. We start to hear a faint scream and crying in the distance in the direction we were running. It was pitch black away from the camp and Mike had the only flashlight (we left ours at the camp he had his from his trip taking a piss), so at this stage we didn't have much choice but to follow the Light, which was frantically pointing here and there in front of him.


The scream gets closer and Mike starts to slow down. We then notice a ratty old cabin that looked like it was abandoned, except for a faint light that we could see from one of the old mildew covered windows. The crying was intense, whoever it was couldn't breathe enough to let out a full yell. We all followed Mike up to the front door and we could all hear the crying from inside. As soon as he knocked on the door it stopped.

We all waited and heard really heavy footsteps walking fast to the door. There was a giant slam against the door and the sound of a bolt unlocking. Then nothing. We waited for a bit knocked a few more times but still nothing happened. We walked around the house (there was no fucking way any of us were leaving each other’s side) and noticed a window, which was a good way up. Alex took a deep breath and asked us to give him a boost so he could see inside. Me and Mike lifted him up to the window. We watched him brush away dirt and webs from the window and place his face close to try and see something.

There was a quick beat. Then suddenly he breathed in fast and let out a loud scream. Then he fell back from the window screaming bloody murder the whole way. We all tried to calm him down, but he was hysterical. We went to him but he started to shake, punch, kick, you name it, and then took off towards the camp.

None of us wanted to be separated so we all ran close behind him. We caught up to him, grabbed him, and set him down. The fire was dying out so I grabbed some nearby wood that we collected and added it to the fire. My hands were shaking, I had to do something. I went back to Alex and we all tried to calm him down. He wouldn't, he just kept screaming and was breathing so hard that he eventually fainted.

All of us were terrified by then and we all kept the fire high until sunrise. Alex kept waking up screaming just like before. By sunrise he was up and looked catatonic, just mumbling to himself and whimpering.

Me and Mike decide to go look at the cabin now that it was daylight. We searched where we thought it was, but there was nothing there. Nothing at all. The indistinct smell from last night had now grown into a very strong smell of something dead, something stale. We headed back to the camping site. When we got there we found Alex had chewed into the sides of his face and swallowed so much blood that he was throwing up. John was at his back, and he looked like he was about to die from exhaustion. I guess we all looked that way. Alex said quietly that we needed to leave. Now.

We all started to pack up the tent. At about noon it started to rain really heavily and the sky began to grow really dark. Alex started to panic. He went and grabbed a big stick and yelled at us to leave it and leave now or he’d knock us out and drag us out of there himself. Mike started yelling at him and they began to fight. We broke it up, finished packing, and started making our way back. After a little while we arrived at a creek we had crossed the previous day, only it was flooded over and the water was moving too fast for us to cross it. Alex started to scream again, yelling at Mike for taking his time packing up the tent when we could have gotten outta here. This went on for a while until we finally convinced Alex to calm down and tell us what happened.

He said as soon as he put his face to the glass, a face on the other side did the same thing and started to smile really big. It had dark eyes and a big, dark mouth. As it’s smile widened, a giant shadow appeared behind it, swung something down and sliced off it’s face. The face stayed stuck to the window and he said it started to laugh quietly as it slid down. Mike, still pissed off, (and though he wouldn't admit it, beginning to get freaked out) started to argue with him again. We eventually started to follow the creek to find a way across.

We then started to see toys floating in the creek. Really old toys, old Barbie dolls and baby dolls. Thus wasn't like any old trash floating in the creek though, this was a lot of Barbies, a lot of baby dolls. One washed towards the side and Mike picked it up. It had some kind of voice chip that was dying and started to say some gurgling words we couldn't understand followed by it's sad excuse for laughter. Then it sounded like it was whispering. We thought the batteries must be dying, he threw it down. We kept going and the sun was startling to set. Alex was freaking out more now, and was whimpering and breathing heavily. We all started to see shadows move behind trees, something we all called BS on until all of us were seeing it. It was barely light out and we stopped as we saw the cabin right in front of us. None of us knew what to think. Mike said ‘This is bull, I’m going in there’. Alex tried to stop him. We all did, all of us just wanted to go home. Mike told us to fuck off, do our own thing, he didn't care anymore, this was all bull.

We started to hear hundreds of the same sort baby doll as before, laughing, whispering, and trying to sing. We started to move forward past the cabin, even Mike. We just kept pushing forward. We smelled something dead in the air, something stale, the same something as before. We started to hear something crying and something screaming. We kept on going. We eventually crossed the creek and left the woods. We got back to our car and got in. It was pitch black and we drove. We were about to get onto I-45 to Houston but the road was under construction and couldn’t be accessed. The signs pointed to a detour. The detour seemed to be small bumpy dirt road going into the woods.

We then saw a young girl come up to us. She looked like she was pretty young and in trouble. She approached the passenger side door and she looked like she was really drugged up or badly beaten. Alex didn't roll down the windows or open the door. When she reached for the handle, he immediately locked it. She put her face on the window and started to smile really big. We floored it. Alex started to cry and scream, and we were all breathing heavy. We finally cut onto a street that took us to 45. When we got back to my apartment no one knew what to say, we just went our separate ways.",nosleep,panicking_man,/r/nosleep/comments/friyw/doll_bits/

Every night, for as long as I can remember, they have watched me. 

For the longest time, I would stare back and try to figure out what exactly I was seeing. When I realized they had no eyes, I stopped looking. I hear them breathing from outside the window, deep ragged breaths that made me pull the blankets and pillows over my head to try to block it out. It never helped.

They would slide back off into the woods when they sun began to rise and I would often wake up to see their slithering forms slipping back into the safety of the trees. I never heard them coming, but I would watch them go.

I tried to tell my parents about them, but I was only five years old and they would brush it off, tuck me into bed themselves for a couple of weeks and insist that there was no such thing as monsters. My father would check the closets and under the bed, the things he remembered being afraid of when he was my age, but he would only look at me funny when I asked him to check outside. As soon as they would leave, I would hear the breathing begin.

Soon they began to whisper.

“Come out and play…”

When I started making friends at school, I would stay over at their houses almost every weekend. Katie started asking about my house and her mom began pressuring my mom to let her parents have a weekend alone. I tried to warn Katie, but she only giggled.

That dreaded weekend came and Katie came home with me after school, having brought her overnight bag with her. Mom made us an afternoon snack and we watched some cartoons. Before I knew it, it was dinner time, the last rays of sunlight beginning to go down.

I stared out the windows as we ate and my mother badgered me for not being a good host. I didn’t care. I wanted to see them coming, for once. I wanted to watch them as they dragged themselves from the woods, I wanted to be able to scream that they were here and show them I wasn’t lying.

Bedtime came and Katie made a bed on the floor beside mine. We stayed up talking about our favorite animals and what we wanted to be when we grew up. She loved turtles. She wanted to be a doctor. I will never forget that.

She fell asleep before I did and I pulled my blankets over my head, having heard the breathing ever since we lay down. 

Click.

Click.

Click click.

I peeked my head out from under the pile of blankets and pillows. They were scratching at the windows and they were staring at Katie. I could see the moonlight reflecting off of their long claws and they shifted their non-seeing gaze to me when they noticed I had looked out again.

“Give us… the girl…”

I shook my head.

That made them angry. Their mouths drew open, revealing sharp black teeth and  a white tongue that snaked around. They started howling at a high pitch, their claws ripping feverously at the windowpanes. I pulled the blankets back over my head.

“We will leave you… Alone… Just give us that one…”

I burrowed deeper, putting my hands over my ears.

“We will never… Come back here…”

I pulled down the covers and they stopped howling, their claws now resting upon the glass. I reached out to the window above my bed, my fingertips deftly undoing the latch. I hid back under the blankets as I heard them push the windows open. Their forms never touched my bed, but I heard them on the carpet.

I changed my mind a second too late, using all of the guts I had to yank the covers off and try to grab at anything to defend Katie with, but there was no one there. The blankets were empty and my windows were wide open. I stood up on my bed to look outside, expecting to see them slivering back into the woods but they weren’t there.

I ran screaming into my parents room, waking them up with my shouts that Katie was gone. My dad took a flashlight out to search the yard, but he stopped when he saw blood on the snow. The police followed the trail for almost a mile, yet no man or dog could find anything at the end. The official report was that Katie wandered outside and was attacked by a bear. 

When questioned, I said nothing, tears pouring down my face.

They never came back.

47,"*CHEESY TITLE INCOMING*: Silent Dreams, Part 1.",1298510645,"**Part 1: I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I have time to waste and I intend to do so. Warning, this will be, to you, the usual, boring ""LISTEN TO MY WEIRD DREAM"" tale, it will be very long and I'm not a very good writer, so *try to* enjoy:**
______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Prologue:** This past week I had my first *real* experience with the Silent Hill franchise, I had bought Silent Hill from the Playstation Network for six bucks after years of discussions about how GREAT the series is. My friends are more into video gaming than I, sure, I played them as a kid but I wouldn't say it stuck with me enough to make me a ""gamer"". The only survival-horror series I had gotten into as a kid was Resident Evil, I spent many a night playing RE2, as it was my favorite. It was soon replaced by 4 but is still second best to me, anyway I'm going off track. 

My first experience with the series was Silent Hill 2, I had gotten to the first *boss*(?) fight with Pyramid Head and stopped playing. Not because I was too scared or bored, I was playing it at a friend's (We'll call him **""M""**) house and the next time I went over neither of us mentioned it and I was a bit too lazy to play a game. I was just over to shoot the shit and smoke cigarettes as we usually did. We had talked a bit about the series, and general other creepiness on the net and in various media.

My second encounter with the game was a bit after **""M""** had moved out of town for college. Me and another friend (We'll call him **""N""**) went down one weekend and then it happened.... 

We were very close to **""M's""** house when disaster struck. Near a large curve in the road **""N""** started to tweak the radio for a good station, I looked up and we were quickly approaching the back of a red truck. I yelled his name, **""'N!' 'N!' 'N!' 'N!'"".** He jerked the steering wheel to the right and we headed through a ditch and into the parking lot of a community center. 

We ran over 3 or 4 parking blocks and finally came to a stop. Other cars drove in to ask us if we were okay, we nodded to each one and I suddenly got the urge to run across the street to see if anything happened to the couple in the truck. They were fine too, and their truck had only minimal scratches. **""N's""** truck on the other hand had smashed a parking block, the rim of the front right tire's rim was bent and small punctures were made to the rubber of the tire itself. The section that scratched the other truck as we avoided head-on collision was somewhat destroyed, which is strange of how untouched the other truck looked.   

It seemed a very small accident as everyone was okay. We had talked to the guy driving the other truck and said his truck was fine but he had to call about the damaged property. A cop came, told us to come in for the report and the fine on a later date and we were good, at least physically. We decided to continue the car on to **""M's""** house since it was so close.

**""N""** started to worry me, he was feeling down, not acting like himself, I didn't blame him. He spent that night doing some college work over the computer, the started to somewhat cut up, and finally have a good time. The next night **""M""** took us for Japanese food, when we returned **""N""** was ready to leave. Looking over the truck's damage he decided it would be best if I stayed behind. He didn't want to risk my life along with his, it was **""N's""** car and it had to get back to town. We watched him leave and, despite **""M's""** car not having a lot of gas, decided to follow him a bit to make sure everything was okay, we got to a nearby Jack's and wished him luck. We watched him off with worried looks and made our way back to wait for his call. About an hour later it had come, he made it! We all had sighs of relief and a good laugh over speaker phone about the whole thing and soon went to bed.

The next day is when I had my second chance to play Silent Hill 2, but things got a bit weird. That weekend was foggy, more than usual in this area. I had continued the fight with Pyramid Head, running side to side, dodging his giant knife, all was going well. But every time he'd start to leave the room the power would go out, and we'd sit in the dark, me being a bit enraged about having to redo the fight. After the third time I was done, as it didn't seem it would end. The power didn't go off for the rest of the night. We joked about the idea that the game didn't want to be played, as if something were blocking it from me.

That night I couldn't sleep, I stayed up, looking into the darkness of the house. The room I slept in is a small porch that's enclosed with the rest of the house. It was surrounded by windows where I could see the rain covered leaves of trees swaying in wind and glistening in the light of the street lamps. I got up and walked around the room looking out to pass time, I knew I wasn't getting to sleep. The storm wind and thunder along with the house essentially being in the middle of nowhere is a cliché setting, but I was anxious nonetheless. 

When I eventually did get to sleep I'd say it was about 4:30 AM, which isn't strange in the least, I'm always staying up into the early morning. The dream I had that night (or morning) was a strange one; I assume everybody has dreams that re-enact moments of their life but I seem to never have them, except for this night....

48,The Cabin - Day 1,1298500049,"Like most suburban families, summer vacation for mine consists of driving for six hours to get as far away from the city as possible for any length of time. For my family, the destination is our cabin up North. Living in Vancouver, that means the 100 Mile House area. Beautiful drive as it may be, the cabin we own is situated on a family lot on one of the many lakes in the area. The lot is actually shared between the two sides of the family (it is actually two cabins on one lot...one for either side, you get the idea). To get to the actual lot, you have to drive through some off-road terrain for a bit. Once you get to the entrance, it's a short winding road to the bottom open area (though it was originally a straight road to the bottom...you'll find out why it was changed), with a fire-pit in the middle. The lake is at the edge, with some docks and some trees. Here are some shots to give you a better idea:

At any rate, this happened when I was younger, about 15 years ago. When it was summer my family went up to the cabin for a week. The drive up was uneventful. I saw a deer or two, my sister and I played cards in the back seat to ease our boredom. It was clear skies all the way. That is, until we got there. Storms aren't uncommon up North, especially during the summer, so we weren't surprised to see those eerie pitch black storm clouds on the horizon once we arrived. We got there around 1pm (my dad insists we hit the roads early), so there was still plenty of daylight left. It was pretty warm too, so I jumped straight into the lake along with my sister and cousins. We swam to the island and swung off the tree-rope-swing-thing that was put there a few years ago. Basically we were having a great time. That's when the clouds came rolling in (faster than normal...). Lightning struck, so naturally we all got scared and got into the cabin as fast as we could. Except for my oldest cousin. He wanted to stay outside and watch the storm, so he stood out on the dock in the now pouring rain. It wasn't long before he changed his mind, especially after lightning struck on the island. When the lightning struck, I could have sworn in that instant I saw my cousins skeleton through his body. My mind might have been playing tricks on me, so I shrugged it off.

The storm only got worse as the night came. Since we were there for a week, we weren't too bummed. We cozied up inside, played some board games, put a VHS movie on the old TV. Standard stuff. It eventually got late, so we decided it was time for bed. Now, my sister, me and my cousins were all sleeping in the same room. Two sets of bunk-beds on either side. I took the top bunk, my sister on the bottom, and my cousins took the other side. They all managed to fall asleep quicker than me. The storm was still going on outside (the wind picked up, thunder/lightning was frequent, rain still pouring).

I must have dozed off, because I remember waking up in the dead of night. I didn't know the time, but I remember the storm had stalled. I also remember a distinct feeling of sudden fear. Not paralyzing fear. The type of fear that gives you that rush of adrenaline...like all your senses are on high alert. At any rate, I was afraid of something. It was dead quiet too. No wind, no rain, not even the call of a Loon out on the lake. Not. A. Sound. My sister and cousins were still fast sleep. I know because I looked across the other side and saw my cousins sleeping. I looked over the side of my bed to the bottom bunk, my sister was still there, snoring. I lifted my head back up and laid back in my bed JUST as lightning struck. That's when I saw it. Between the two bunk-beds, at the foot of the beds, was a dark figure. It wasn't a shadow. It was clearly a figure, but it was dark and had no distinguishable features. Save for the eyes. Pure white eyes. It just stood there, looking straight ahead out the window. Then to me. I was scared beyond words. It just stared at me for what felt like an eternity. I just kept thinking to myself it wasn't real. That I was having a nightmare. Lightning struck again. It was gone...from the foot of the beds. I turned my head...and there it was, staring at me from right beside me. I instinctively cried out in that moment and crawled as far away into the corner of my bed as I could. It didn't do anything else but stare at me.

Lightning struck a third, final time. The wind and rain had come back. The figure, whatever it was, was gone. I could not, and would not, go back to sleep. I simply sat there, in fear, until the morning came. I wanted to go home. Whatever it was that was staring at me would make the next week a living nightmare for me.

49,heavy breathing,1298497610,"This is another one of my many experiences growing up. I don't have anything like this happen to me anymore.

When i was around 12 or 13 i went to visit my parents' friends in texas. It was a nice house and they had just moved in. Everything seemed fine then we all went to bed. I had myself a brand new portable television, like the kind you can carry around your neck and it will pick up broadcasts. Well anyway i watched that little tv until i felt tired and turned it off.

 I laid in bed and i heard something strange. It sounded like someone was breathing right next to me. I thought to myself that this couldn't be possible it must be something else. I quickly picked the tv back up to make sure it was turned off. It was definitely off, i even put my ear up to it to see if it was making any sound. Then i put my ear up to the wall to see if it was coming from there but the wall was silent, but i could still hear the breathing. I thought to myself this cannot be real. I got up and opened the closet to see if anything was in there, there wasn't. But i did notice the breathing got quieter as i got further way from that spot. 

The sound was definitely coming from that side of my bed, between me and the wall. I laid there for a while hoping the breathing would go away but it didn't. Eventually i got so freaked out i ran out of there into my parents room and slept there for the rest of the night. 

I still wonder why my parents didn't think me telling them this sort of stuff was weird.",nosleep,sashimi_taco,/r/nosleep/comments/frby3/heavy_breathing/
50,Philly to Boston,1298492504,"I had been working as a runner in East Boston all summer, I filled my days with driving around the city and metro area in an F350 picking up supplies for the crews of the boats. It was a great job, I got fresh air and had a lot of independence. My bosses must have thought highly of my work ethic, because they decided to send me on my biggest trip yet. I was to fly to Philadelphia and pick up a truck from the local branch.
The flight there went perfectly fine; I got off the plane, hopped in the parking lot shuttle and promptly found the big white F350 that the Philadelphia branch had left for me. It was around 4PM so I had about 2 ½ to 3 hours of sunlight left. I decided it made more sense to just get on with the driving, forget about any cheese steaks or the liberty bell. 

So I punched the address into my GPS and got on I-95, then the jersey turnpike, then 95 again. I had done my fair share of long distance driving before this, so I had my technique down.  A booklet full of CDs and a pack and a half of Marlboro 27s was all that was gonna accompany me for the next 6 hours. Part of me liked the solitude, but another part of me just wanted to get back to Boston and meet up with my friends. Either way, I had a good deal of driving ahead of me. 

It wasn’t until around 7:30 that I started to notice the truck was riding a little funny. Nothing mechanical, it just felt like something was rolling around loose in the cab. A subtle but noticeable *thump, thump, thump* (at this point I should mention that the truck had a very tinted bed cover over it, a full enclosure. The kind where it’s almost pointless to use your rearview because it’s so difficult to see through the tint). I brushed it off and just kept driving, playing it off to a loose palate or something the Philadelphia branch had left in the cab.

45 minutes pass by and the noises comes back, this time louder; raising more concern *THUMP, THUMP, THUMP*. I decide to pull over at the next exit and investigate what the lazy asses from Philadelphia obviously couldn’t take out of the truck. I can’t remember the exit off the top of my head, I know it was around Mount Vernon, a real seedy lookin place. I knew I didn’t want to stay long, something in the air had me feeling uneasy….plus I had a good leg of the trip left.  I pulled into what looked like a run down convenient store parking lot, I couldn’t really tell because it lacked any type of sign. It had an all glass front, typical of a highway exit store….just no type of advertisement on the windows, no lights, no lines for parking.  “fuckin jersey” I thought to myself as I parked the truck near what I assumed was the entrance. I just figured it was an old mom n’ pop type establishment, keeping it down to the bare essentials. A store that went the way of most family stores, run out of town by Wal-Mart.

Either way that wasn’t my concern, im just here to check out the truck and get back on the road. I hop out, walk to the back and grab the handle. It releases and falls and in that instant my phone drops square on the pavement. “FFFUUCKKKKK” I try and bend down to get it as fast as possible….as if that will prevent it from being broken…..”okay, okay….it’s not broken….we’re cool”. I start to bend back up, I only move my head a few inches before I see something flash out of the back of truck and go straight behind me. At this point im PETRIFIED, frozen. Just standing there with my legs spread wide and my head in between them like a pee wee football center that doesn’t know what to do after snapping the ball. Not a very good stance to defend ones self.

I snap out of it and get back up, I can move freely but my mind is going a million miles an hour. I have no idea where I am, something just fucking jumped out of this truck, there’s nobody within sight. Now im no coward, but when you’re in a situation like this it’s hard to try and act tough….all I wanted to do was close that damned tailgate and get back to my driving. And that’s exactly what I forced myself to do, all the while having that feeling that no matter where my back was turned there was something peering at me. That horrifying feeling you used to get as a kid when you were walking back from taking out the trash at night….you just block out all those feelings and book it up the stairs as fast as you can, then you’re safe and in your bright warm house.

That wasn’t the case this time, I got in the cab and started the truck but that feeling didn’t subside. I drove out of the parking lot and back on the highway but the feeling never went away. 4 more hours of driving and the feeling NEVER went away, I was sweating bullets. Every minute seemed like an eternity. I just tried my hardest to focus on the road and nothing else,”just look at the road, nothing else. Forget the mirrors; just watch the road and stay focused”. Eventually I’d make it back home and I’d be safe and warm in my house. Then a familiar sight, the Massachusetts state trooper office. “Thank god, im close to home, only a little while longer and im safe”.
I just bite my lip and clench my fists around the wheel, all the while the pit of my stomach is dropping, hair on the back of my neck raising and relaxing, then raising again. 45 more minutes of this unbearable feeling, all the while trying to convince myself that it’s nonsense.  “Whatever….this is all stupid. Compose yourself; you’re pulling up to the shipyard….this is all over”

*THUMP…..THUMP…..THUMP* all that confidence I just tried to build up was out the window. I was frozen again. Do I go outside and possibly face whatever it is that stayed with me this whole trip? What are my other options? I cant just TAKE the company truck home with me….and even if I did I’d have to get out at some point. A few deep breathes and I grab the door handle…..*click*. I push it open and get my feet on the ground and close the door behind me. My own truck is only a few hundred feet away.
“Just start walking, don’t even bother checking your surroundings….you’re fucking with your own head” I start to hear gravel kicking behind me, foot steps. I pick up my pace “don’t look”, im almost at my truck….forty feet. The gravel starts kicking louder, it’s running. At this point all bets are off, it’s a dead sprint to my door, key already in hand. I somehow manage to get the key in first try, jump in and just follow my mantra. “don’t look, just stay focused on the road and don’t look.”

The truck starts and I move those wheels as fast as the V8 could turn them. But then something happened, the mantra left my head. I wasn’t repeating “don’t look, you can’t look” anymore. It was almost as if the fear had left entirely. As I was pulling out of the lot I felt the calmness surrounding me, I was in the clear. It must have all been in my head, I have a tendency to let the stupid little things that go “bump in the night” get to me, an active imagination.

I don’t know why I did it, I had just convinced myself that it was nothing….but some tiny part of me wanted more reassurance. I glanced in the rearview……

51,Creepiest place I have EVER been.,1298489311,,nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fr8mq/creepiest_place_i_have_ever_been/
52,Clown Painting.,1298487485,"     When I was younger,around eight years old, my mother and I lived with my grandparents. She was in law school and had to wait tables in what little spare time she had to pay for it,so obviously she was having difficulty affording a place for us. My grandparents are very kind people and they have a fairly large house (two people living in a house large enough for a comfortable ten) so they took us in immediately. My grandfather had the house constructed in the 1960's, nobody has died in it and they live in a very unremarkable part of the country which lacks any history whatsoever. 
     Being a child, I of course had some superstitions, but frankly my experiences in that house have always seemed a bit beyond my imaginative capabilities. Every night I would be sent to bed fairly early in the evening,being eight, and that of course meant that I was to be alone. Alone,in the massive upstairs of my grandparents' house while they dozed on the couch downstairs for a few hours until they found their way to their bed. 
     The room I stayed in belonged to my cousin who had recently moved out. On his wall was the most hideous picture of a clown I've ever seen in my entire life. Now understand, I maintain no unusual fear of clowns. They don't bother me in the slightest today, nor did they as a child. But this picture,this painting...it seemed evil from the first time I lay eyes upon it. One night, it began to glow. And not a slight my-eyes-got-used-to-the-dark-and-I'm-eight glow. A legitimate light-up-the-room shit-my-pants glow. And the clown looked at me. It didnt say a word. It just looked at me. And stayed that way. 
     The glow faded eventually but I was already wide awake. I sprinted to the door (which was on the other side of the room) and threw on the light. I eventually wound up sleeping in the hallway. The strangest part was, the clown stayed in that position. Before, it was just a blank-faced clown holding a cigar. After that night, it had this..menacing grin on its face. I pointed it out to my grandparents,who infrequently visit any room upstairs other than their own, and they didnt notice the difference because unsurprisingly,neither of them remembered ever seeing the painting before. I begged for a new room, but it was the only room with a twin bed in it, and I was just a child, so they dismissed my fear.
      Every night a feeling of dread would creep over me, childish fear, as if every time I looked away from the painting it would draw closer. It didn't of course. All it did was glow. And stare at me. One night I had a dream that it the clown had jumped down from the picture and started chasing me. It wasn't a long chase. It tackled me, tore my throat open,and ate me. A bit graphic,for an eight year old's dream, but it's how it was. I woke up in the greatest pain my young body had ever remembered feeling. I ran to my grandparents immediately, without thought. When they asked me where it hurt, I actually had to think about it. I decided after a moment that it was my back. My grandmother lifted my shirt, and gasped. 
     My back had a crispy black hole in the center of it. Almost like a cigar burn. I don't remember what conclusion they drew as to how I received the burn, because I already knew. From that day forward, the grinning clown no longer held a cigar in his hand.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fr7wp/clown_painting/
53,Had a nosleep moment last night.,1298486219,"Around 11:30 I announced to my boyfriend that I thought it was bed time. He let me know that he agreed and just wanted to submit his application real quick. I replied, ""Okay,"" and climbed into my bed and shut off the lights.

A few minutes latter I felt pressure on the bed as he laid next to me. I started talking to him about how I was probably going to turn in my scholarship essay and application tomorrow.

 I was pondering out loud about the application process, when my boyfriend stepped into the room and asked me, ""What were you saying?"" 

Sheer horror overcame me as I realized that it was not my boyfriend who had laid next to me. My eyes opened wide and I turned my head to see who had. There was nothing there. Took me awhile to fall asleep.

54,Maybe I'll stop reading comments?,1298484763,"I dig this community.  I find some really great stories here.  But I find myself getting pissed sometimes at the smugness that gets thrown into the mix in the comments.

Everything's true here, right?  Suspend your disbelief?  

Why doesn't that apply to the comments as well?  That's the thing that throws me out of it more than any [true] tag.  You get somebody posting a story, and then a comment underneath that is often a thinly-veiled variation of, ""ooh, spooky.  Glad I'm a smart little atheist who doesn't believe in ghosts, God, or the supernatural.""

Maybe I'll start skipping comments, or maybe I should just start thinking of these people as the people who are about to get eaten by the Thing In The Night after professing not to believe in Things In The Woods.

I get that most folks here are skeptics by nature.  But if you want a place that suspends disbelief, then stick to that.  There are good days and bad days, I guess.

55,The house by the cemetery,1298482575,"We were in between houses and were trying to move into a new one relatively soon. So as things goes, my parents toted my 2 sisters and myself around as they looked at houses. 

We find this house that clearly needs some work. The first time through the house I don't pick up on anything out of the ordinary. The basement is fully finished and has a lot of windows. The first floor and second floor overlook the street and part of the cemetery. I didn't want to live so close to the cemetery. Just being this close on a visit to the house really creeped me out. 

And that's when it started to happen. I was drawn back downstairs. Like something was pulling me. I talked to my dad on the way down. He didn't care where I explored in the house as long as I didn't leave or go to the garage. 

When I finally reach the basement my legs felt heavy. I stood about a foot into the room when my eyes flashed. A different room was in front of me. Everything normal was there, except for the smell of blood, urine, and feces. There was blood everywhere. Old black stains of caked blood and fresh bright red blood on the walls. 

The door slammed behind me and my body was whipped up against the wall. I couldn't reach the door handle and I couldn't scream. I was helpless. The dread seemed to pour into every inch of me. My hand jiggled the handle, almost there... nothing. My muscles were cramping and tightening. I didn't think there was anything I could do. I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I had to get out. 

I closed my eyes and reached for the handle one more time. Success! The door flung open and I ripped myself away from the room. The stairs were easy enough to jump 2-3 at a time with all the adrenaline build up I had. My dad was at the top of the stairs negotiating prices when he saw that I was winded. I pulled him aside and told him, to the best of my ability, what had just happened. His thick accent sliced through the dense air, ""No this is not haunted. Don't worry. We have rabbi come and bless...its ok."" My face changed quickly from worry to anger to which he replied. ""Ok, you can walk home. It's no big deal.""

I was happy to leave that house and never go back.",nosleep,redtoken,/r/nosleep/comments/fr5v7/the_house_by_the_cemetery/

57,One Mean Grip,1298473537,"The first story I told about my parents cabin happened when I was 12. That was the first inkling I had that the place wasn't right. Now I'll tell y'all about the last incident I was privy to in that place. This is the one that sealed the deal for me, and I ain't been back there since.

The college I attended just happened to be an hour's drive from the cabin, so when I determined that was where I wanted to study, my father gave me a spare set of keys to the place and told me if I ever wanted to go there, maybe for some peace and quiet or as a place to take a girl on a weekend, I just had to follow his set of rules about the place, but was otherwise welcome to go anytime. Course, by then the last place I'd want to take a girl was to a run-down shack in the woods. Didn't seem like the type of locale that would put a girl in any sorta mood cept maybe afeared for her life. Needless to say, I didn't take him up on the offer.

Until...

Senior year of college, my roommate decided to ask me what the keys were for, since I always left em hangin on a hook by my desk. I told him about the cabin and he got it in his head to have a little party out there the next weekend, inviting his girl and a couple other friends along. Now I ain't no idiot, I've watched my share of horror flicks, and this scenario he had come up with screamed machete-wielding psycho murder spree to me, and I said as much. How I ended up drivin out there late that Friday night with my buddy in the navigator seat with a box of beer at his feet, two girls in the back of my car and another carload behind us, I can't rightly say, but that's how it ended up.

The cabin's set on the edge of a lake, so it wasn't long after we arrived that people were strippin down to go for a swim. I ain't keen on going in that water because of a leech incident I had when I was younger, so I just sat on the dock and dangled my feet in the water while everyone else splashed around. If you don't move, minnows'll come and nibble your toes, and I figgered that feeling plus a light buzz would get me through the night.

One couple who I didn't really know started driftin off from the rest of the group, probably to do somethin mischievous in the deeper water. I was being distracted by the girl my roommate had hooked me up with as she tried to coax me to get a little more wet. I didn't want to spoil the festivities with talk of leeches so I told her someone had to guard all the valuables because there's a high chance of wild animals sneaking around and makin off with em if nobody was watching.

That's when I realized that amid the screams of laughter and splashing was a different kinda scream. It was night, but clear, and I could see that of the couple that had drifted off, only the girl was visible, and she was not screamin in a happy way. Everyone else sorta quieted down and stopped swimmin when they realized something was wrong, but I was way ahead of em. I had already jumped in, waded out into the muck and then swam as hard as I could to where she was caterwaulin. He still wasn't anywhere in sight when I got there, but she was blubberin and waving frantically and couldn't communicate right, so I didn't stop to try to figger it out, I just went under and felt around. That water is murky as Hell and full of god knows what, so it was a blind fumblin I was doin. It didn't take long to find him though, because he was just under the surface, puttin up some sort of fight, grabbin at his leg and kicking. I reached down to see what he was caught on and I swear to God 

*I felt a fucking hand, cold as a witch's ass, grippin the guy's ankle.*

I couldn't pry the fingers loose, so in a panic, I did the only thing I could think to do and fucking bit the thing at the wrist, gettin a mouth full of shitty lake water and the disgusting taste of that thing on my tongue. It was like bitin into a greasy chicken leg. The hand let loose and then jerked outta my grip and disappeared. I wasn't of a mind to go searchin for it and I'd kinda used up my air bitin it, so me, the guy and his girl hightailed it to shallow water so fast we probably coulda run on the surface of the lake.

When we all got to shore, I told my roommate what I'd felt holdin the guy under, and we ran to the dock, watchin the water for signs of someone swimmin off, but there wasn't nobody else out there. All fun had drained outta the group, so the rest of em went inside to dry off and try to get a fire goin. When we finally gave up and joined em, the guy showed me his leg, and there was a bruise formin around his ankle, clear as day, like a wrap of four fingers and a thumb. And if you think that's freaky, even more bizarre was that judgin from the bruise, the thumb was unnaturally long, wrappin the full length of his ankle and touchin the tips of the other fingers.

We didn't even stay the night. Everybody got dried off, warmed up and then we packed our stuff back in the cars and got the fuck outta Dodge. That was the last time I visited that cabin.

61,The Shade in the Mirror,1298456475,"I was what you would consider vain. I had a mirror in my room that took up half the wall and still I sat dead center before it, examining my features. Mirrors have always brought me peace, for here before one I can hear my thoughts clear and external. There is nothing odd about it. My father didn't agree. He thought I'd do well to act less of my mother's nature and venture outside, that his son should have no business with foundations and moisturizers. He believed it was unnatural for a boy to be so averse to physical contact. But it was there that I first heard my mother's words since she had died in childbirth. I heard her as loud as my thoughts.

As I grew older I became something of an enigma. I was loved as I was reviled, cruelly taunted and yet supremely disdainful. I found myself quite the ladies man and yet there was something bestially coarse in their touch. I began to become... disinterested... in their flimsy pursuits, yet still the mirror called to me. There came a time when I was removed from time and my thoughts would speak for minutes in a day.

During this period my father died. He carelessly stepped into a cream and the resulting fall brought his neck to an unfortunate angle. This forever silenced his criticisms of my increasingly languorous lifestyle and yet his voice joined my thoughts and together he and mother would see me radiant through the mirror as I was meant to be seen.

That was when I could see their shadow, revealed in the mirror to appear as if they stood behind me, but I knew they were before me and I would see the smile on my face before I felt it. Cousins brought food for many weeks until they may have been years, and yet gradual they tapered until they became nothing but voices and shadows. I knew they must be dead.

They had become trapped where I longed to travel and I began to leave my chair, wobbling on my golden legs as I pushed against the mirror. The shadows would rise and stand aside my flawless reflection. I could see their breath fog the glass and I knew I could break it and claim my reflection as myself. I raised my fist but my reflection proved quicker, a spray of glass replaced the hated barrier between the mirror and I.

There was a good deal of blood.

My forearm had taken the shards that would scar my face, my neck had taken the rest. In my last moments I crawled to my chair, and lifted myself. I could see the remnants of the shattered mirror although the shadows were beside me now, closing the field of my vision. In the mirror I could see what I had become. My golden features had become gray, crooked and lank with malnourishment and age. Sleepless hours of inactivity before the mirror had broken me. I pulled the crimson glass from my neck and brought it to my eye, willing it to pass through me so that I may reclaim my youth, my flawless beauty.

Now my mirror is gone, and yet I have gained countless more. My thoughts are still external and at times your voice will join those of the shadows and I know that you are admiring youth and beauty. Try not to mind me in the corner of the mirror, I will only last a moment. I do not like to be seen and now for the first time I only want to touch. I will only last a moment.

62,What does r/nosleep believe in?,1298455567,"I have a legitimate question for those who regularly browse r/nosleep and for those who have ever posted. Now I have been a lurker for a long time, and I quite enjoy these stories (especially b4 bed). I was wondering what viewpoint you have regarding ghosts, demons, monsters, aliens, etc. Do you believe in Christianity, Islam, Judaism, atheist, agnostic, or perhaps a blend? With your views, how do you rationalize the multitude of stories (supposedly real) that come from all religions, races, cultures, history. 
For example a Christian may interpret something paranormal happening to them as something caused by a demon, as explained in the bible. They then use Christian methods to exorcise demon out of their lives. Now then half-way across the world there are indigenous peoples in Africa who have experienced a similar occurrence believe that their witch doctor saved them from, say a vampire. This is but one of many conflicts that arise when certain faiths and ideologies conflict on a cultural level. Do you believe in some things, but reject others? How do you explain your belief in, for example, aliens, but reject the notion of a demon dog?
Oh and something that crossed my mind that seems a bit silly, but as I thought about it I started to really wonder... do aliens have ghosts? I assume they are intelligent beings, and if dogs can have ghosts, why not aliens?

63,Feeding,1298448185,"I remember the year my mother broke her back. My dad was in the army, so we used to travel long distances to the hospital she was being treated at. We had moved during her recovery period and had to make trips to go see her every second week.  I was too young to remember the bad parts of her recovery, when she came home finally or ever really being able to feel any true empathy for my mothers pain - but I remember the one and only time I encountered something from the other side.

On one of the long stretches, we stopped at one of the few road side motels on the Trans Canada highway. It was a dump, but at the time was about as good as we could afford. The property was beautiful. at one point, but not well maintained. There was at least a pool, and I loved to swim when I was that young. 

I saw another boy with his family, around my age. We talked about what little boys talk about, Ninja Turtles and G.I Joe. We talked about the pool outside. We both swam with our fathers that day, enjoying the simple sunshine and simple pleasure of a cold pool on a hot day. 

That night my father laid me down on the bed that night, kissed my, and he slept on the couch. 

Soon after, it started.

The feeling of cold, the feeling of every hair standing on edge. My breath became icy, the air felt sharp in my young lungs. 

*Come play, Michael, I miss you so much*

It was my grandmother, calling to me from the hotel room door. It had opened slightly. I saw the outline of her face just barely making it out in the darkness, but it was wrong. It wasn’t filled with loving warmth of my mother’s smile, it was a different face.

It looked *hungry.* 

*Come to me, my love, swim with me*

My head hurt, the bed sheets felt like they weighed a thousand pounds, I was locked in place. For whatever reason, to this day I don’t know, I knew that it wasn’t her. 

Instinctual concepts flashed through my head.

*Predator*

It wants to *feed.*

I turned away from the door and pulled the blankets over my head like a shield. I cried for it to bother someone else. I could hear it calling me, I feel her anger in my refusal to leave my bed and walk towards the door. I drowned in the cold air of its breath down my neck, and ice cold fingers clawing from the dark up the bed sheets. I prayed it would leave me alone, that it would find something else to feed on.

*Someone* else.

Then the lights went on

I woke up screaming, my dad holding me tight. He said I had a nightmare, and was thrashing and crying. I smelled the rancid odor of piss; the sheets were soaked with urine. 
He promised me nothing could hurt me. He changed the sheets, and held me in bed until I passed out from exhaustion.

The next morning we went to leave, but there was an ambulance blocking the way out of the parking lot. The father of the boy we had swam with was sitting on the curve, crying. My father rolled down the window and asked an officer what was going on.

A boy had died last night. 

They found him in the pool.

Drowned, what a shame.

So young, what a shame.

Somehow the pool door was unlocked, what a **shame.**

I felt two new emotions for the first time that day... empathy and guilt….

69,I couldn't tell anyone that I heard the scream.,1298440682,"So this is a story that I've rarely broken out since it happened, and it took me a while to feel even a tinge of comfort while telling it. This all occurred last August. To give some background, I had just returned from a summer working at a backpacking camp in New Mexico (I'm from Ohio) and I would be returning to school in VA the next week. So I had just one week to spend with my old friends and we decided to do what any Ohio college kids would do in August: sit on my friend's back porch and drink.

My friend lives on what I would call the edge of the boondocks- not really far out there, but still in the country. Behind his house are some extremely dense woods that go on for quite a while. About 6 of us showed up there after sitting at Denny's for a while (there's not much to do back home) at around midnight. As we were walking from our cars to his house I heard the unmistakable sound of far-off tires screeching, followed by a distinct BOOM! I was not the only one who heard, as one of the others turned and looked at me as if to say ""That didn't sound good."" But we thought little of it after a few minutes, which in hindsight wasn't the most responsible course of action. At any rate, we headed out to the back porch to drink and jam a little. 

We had been sitting out there for about 15 minutes, each well into his second beer, when there was a quite spot in the conversation. This being away from the city August, a quiet spot in the conversation meant silence in general, since there was no other noise but crickets. At that moment I heard a faint, high pitched noise. The conversation picked back up, but I remained focused on that noise. It was coming from the direction of the woods, and I knew that there was a road less than a mile on the other side of them, which was where I decided the earlier crash must have happened. As I concentrated on the noise it became all too clear that it was the sound of someone, probably a woman from the pitch, screaming in absolute agony. It was faint, but it was unmistakable. I heard it for about a minute and it froze me.

I was on the verge of alerting the rest of the group to what I was hearing (they were back to their conversation) when we heard an ambulance coming up the road, sirens blaring. At that point I decided it would be best not to freak them out the way I had been freaked out, and to rest assured that paramedics had gotten to the scene. I meant to watch the local news the next day to see if there was anything about it, but there was nothing. I have yet to tell the people who were there with me what I heard.

TL;DR I heard a car crash and then someone screaming in agony in the middle of the night and told no one. ",nosleep,coombuyah26,/r/nosleep/comments/fqume/i_couldnt_tell_anyone_that_i_heard_the_scream/

Now one would think these kind of dreams to be normal, except for the fact that in all of them she is alive, and we have normal conversations and I ask her questions about why she's been gone so long. I dont remember the last night I haven't had a dream about her. Back around christmas time my whole family got noticeably stressed out, our tree went bare for some time. Weird stuff started happening, we all felt like she was watching us when we were in the living room. Once we all got into a huge argument. We were all sitting down, and suddenly this bb gun pellet pops and ricochets off an empty ornament box. (Everyone was sitting and not moving, my brother's bb gun was up, broken in a box.) The next moment a big box which had been standing in a corner for quite some time suddenly knocks over. I say to my family ""Mom's not too pleased that we're arguing."" We stop and everything calms down. After that I was lying on the rug in that room petting my dog and it felt as if the air was vibrating with anger, like she was watching us. I went to another room to see if it was just me and it wasn't, I felt fine downstairs. When I went back into the room, the feeling was back. Christmas ended, and the feeling of her presence gradually disappeared. 

In a dream I had a month ago, I asked my mom ""Why weren't you with us during christmas? It would've been great! You should've been there!"" Her reply: ""But I was there!""",nosleep,elloellopolly,/r/nosleep/comments/fqrap/the_room_was_vibrating_with_her_anger/

74,Birds,1298427221,"I keep finding dead birds in my basement.  

This started around late December.  There aren't any windows down there and I can't find any holes in the walls.

I called the exterminator this morning.  He asked if I had any cats or other pets that could be killing them and dragging them inside.  I said no.

We agreed that the weirdest part was how all the birds in my area won't be back from their migration until late March at the earliest.

**EDIT:** Birds officially gone. Other stuff is sort of, kind of happening, though:

75,Frozen,1298426114,"This has only happened to me about two or three times, but the one time that it had affected me the most I can still remember vividly.

Sometimes when I'm lying in bed, and I'm in almost-asleep mode (where I'm either falling asleep or waking up and my brain is still sort of dreaming even though I can tell I'm still lying in bed), I tend to just barely open my eyes and imagine weird, abstract things through the blur of my squinting eyes. It's almost never anything creepy, just strange blobs of colors and unnatural figures. For example, at one point I would imagine what appeared to be a small stack of bright red boxes that looked something like [this](http://imgur.com/gOG9e). It isn't scary, but it's just something I think I see.

However, one night when I was laying in bed in almost-asleep mode after having woke up at what I found out later to be 4 AM, I once again barely opened my eyes and caught a very faint and blurry glimpse of a tall, skinny man in a suit without a head. He was just standing there in front of me.

Something about him being there terrified me more than anything I can imagine. I literally locked up. I could not move no matter how hard I tried. If that weren't enough, I suddenly felt as if I were sticking my head out of the window of a moving car, and I could clearly hear the sound of wind rushing past my head. 

This continued for what felt like hours, even though in reality it was a couple minutes. Just this strange man and wind. Neither of us moved. I didn't know what to do, but I knew I had to force myself to shift at least a little bit, because something in my mind was yelling out to me that if I could move, all of this would go away.

I continued to lay there, every breath becoming more difficult to take. But finally, I jerked myself from the situation, and I turned on my back, and I blinked, gasping for air.

One would expect that that would have been the end of it all, but before I mysteriously fell asleep again in a split-second, the last thing I heard was my bedroom door slamming shut.",nosleep,Divinus,/r/nosleep/comments/fqpm8/frozen/

84,That Laughter ...,1298403163,"So my friend Willy lived across the street from my high school in an old parsonage. 

It wasn't a terribly creepy house in and of itself but it was old and I never liked being in it at night by myself, even though I slept over there a lot, Willy being one of my best friends. The weirdest part was a laundry chute that went from the upstairs down to the basement. This chute was right outside Willy's room and the normal basement grumblings would travel through the chute and into the room. Not terrifying, per se, but unsettling.

I also didn't like being upstairs at night because there was a wrap-around deck sort of thing that went all along the perimeter of the house. The sonofabitch would creek like nothing else, and I swore there were times when I would wake up in the middle of the night and here soft foot steps padding along, or see something float by the window ... 

One Friday, Willy's dad took a few of us out to see a movie. We came home after and spent the night at Willy's house, upstairs in that room. It was a nasty night, all stormy, and even though there were a few of us in the room (I think four altogether) I was kind of spooked.

We finally get to sleep after the normal teen-age shennanigans. This night, I woke up as normal but there was something different ... there was another noise.

A clacking. A tapping ... a sort of scraping ... 

I looked out the window, from the floor and immediately sat up straight. There was a woman outside, all in white with a terrible, terrible smile. She saw me and started laughing, a terrible, unearthly, UNGODLY cackle that woke up my friends who all started SCREAMING when they saw her. The laughing continued, and soon the lady was doubled over ...

... wait, doubled over? Willy's mom pulled off her mask, smiling like a banshee. She got us good.

The next morning at breakfast, I was congratulated for being the only one who didn't scream like a baby. 

Of course, none of them know that I still get a chill every time I hear Willy's mom laughing ... ",nosleep,Setevin,/r/nosleep/comments/fqhaf/that_laughter/

86,My Grandfathers House,1298390067,"When I was very young - about 4-5 years old - we spent a couple years living at my Grandfathers house. My parents were young and it was free rent, so we stayed till they could afford a house of our own. His house is a duplex in a particularly old part of Toronto. My earliest memories are of being terrified to be alone anywhere in that house. Especially on the second floor. My Mother would have to physically sit on the end of my bed till I fell asleep. If I had to go to the bathroom, I would RUN. I have memories of strange things happening while being there. There would be times I'd get up and try to leave my room and the knob would seem to be held from the outside. The normally docile cat would hiss and attack people when it was put upstairs. The closet door would close itself. Those were the things that for years I thought were awful nightmares. But those were welcomed compared to the reoccurring nightmare I remember having over and over, to this day - 20 years later.

I would go upstairs during the middle of the day to get some toys, and when I got up there I would hear my name - ""Brandon...Brandon..."". As soon as my name was said, I was no longer in control of my body and was only watching from inside my head as my body led me to my parents room. Getting in there, I would see a lady crouched up against the ceiling, at the point where the two walls and ceiling meet, with her hands against each wall. Her hair was midnight black and greasy but thick. She was old but looked kind. ""Brandon...I love you... come to me..."" As I got in the room and closer to her, her hair got more and more gray, and I noticed no pupils in her eyes. The closer I got, the more sinister she appeared. I was terrified, but couldn't do anything but come closer. ""Brandon...I need you..."" I knew this wasn't something friendly, even as a little boy. Usually around then I would black out and wake up somewhere else, most of the time in bed at night.

We moved away after my Mother and my Grandfathers live in girlfriend got into an argument a few years later, and I never had the nightmares again. I had almost forgotten about it to be honest, until about a year ago. My Mom and I were chatting about scary stories, and she said the scariest thing she ever had happen to her was at that house. She came home and noticed that while my brother was downstairs with everyone else, I was upstairs in her room. She said she walked in and I was at the foot of her bed, staring at a corner of the ceiling. When I heard that my blood turned cold like I didn't even know it could. She looked at me and asked what I was doing in her room. ""I'm talking to the lady Mommy, don't you see her?"" I said. ""What lady?"" asked my Mom.

87,Laundry lady,1298390055,"This isn't a scary story as much as a strange phenomenon that has followed my immediate family around for years. I wish I had an explanation, but it's not threatening or disruptive so at least it makes things interesting.


When I was a kid, my mom used to tell me about this ""laundry lady."" She claimed when she went to do laundry, mid cycle the top load washer would open and be left open. Kinda weird since it seems to work against gravity. Claimed there was a ""ghost"" doing it.


Then we moved to an apartment. It happened again and again. Different washer, different place. Sometimes even a basket on top of the washer would be moved to the floor. Always during spin cycle.


Then we moved to our current house. Again. Different washer, different place. 


Every time she told me these stories I'd laugh it off assuming she was trying to scare me and freak me out.


Then it started happening to me. I realized it wasnt scary but just weird.


All washers were top load and im SURE theres some reason as to why it kept happening. That is until i went away to school.


At my university, the washers were side load. These suckers would lock from start to finish and good luck trying to pry them open until it was ""done."" in fact, a couple times my money had been eaten and i couldnt get them open! 


one night i go to collect my wash and the door is sitting open with 10 or so minutes left on the washer. no water on the floor or anything.

89,My childhood and the experiences that have been with me to this day.,1298362836,"This was happening when I was about eleven, to thirteen years old, small things still happen to me to this day, but rarely, I haven't told anyone this before, and I think about it everyday, I hope someone can shine some light on why this happend, or can explain a little bit to me.

The first time I saw a ghost is when I lived in San Diego, I was about nine, i'm not exactly sure though. I was in my room, the door was closed and it was pitch black, I was sleeping, and it was in the middle of the night when I woke up, I saw a white dress floating right infront of me, I still can't get the image out of my head, when I saw it I was filled with horror, I felt that the only thing I could do was scream, my body was frozen in place, then my parents rushed into the room and turned on the lights, and it was gone, they insisted it was a dream, but I know it wasn't. In later years, I found out my grandparents had gave it to my mom, it was really, really old.

A little background.
Around this time, my family had alot to issues, and I feel it has emotionally traumatized me to this day, maby that's why I saw these things, i've always been a very quiet person, and I only have had two friends, which i've known my entire life, and never have had a relationship with a female. I'm a bit socially awkward, and have always been seen as the freak, weirdo, you know, those things.

During this time, I was scared to death by insects, like mosquitos, I remember one time my parents had went out for a couple of hours, and my brothers were gone from the house, a large mosquito had gotten in the house and I was on the computer, it was a couple feet away from me and the dread I felt was indescribable, I cried, and yelled '' what do you want from me?! '' I felt I was being watched, I was in terror. During this time I use to see things running, shadows specifically, I remember one time when I was walking down the hallway to my room, I saw a shadow figure run across the top of the steps, I was frightened, but I didn't run away, probably because I was so use to things like this happening.

One thing that still freaks me out to this day, is a face I use to see, it was of a woman, her faced seemed to be burnt, one day I was watching t.v, I was on a couch against the wall, then there was a couch to the left, then a table behind that couch - her face popped up right behind the couch, the face dissapeared a second later. I saw this face again, when I was laying in my parents room, there were to mirrors on both sides of the room, the bed was in the middle, I was laying on my side and I opened my eyes, in the mirror it was the lady with the burned face, once again, a second later, it was gone. It was a extreme feeling of helplessness, and I couldn't sleep that night, i'd be sitting on my bed with the blankets up to my lap, staring at my door I don't know why I saw her face, I haven't seen any horror movies at that point, or anything close to it. Everytime I go to that room, or the area behind the couch, I get the feeling that someone is staring at me. Oddly enough, my dad told me he use to see a old woman in his bedroom, and on the bottom of the stairs.

I'm still very paranoid to this day, when I go in any room, I always close the closet, I open the curtains to see if anythings behind it, if i'm in the bathroom i'll open up the glass doors, because if I don't, it'll feel like someone is behind them, staring at me, and I get that nervous feeling. Once I leave the bathroom, i'll sprint to get away, to wherever I was before, I don't know why, but it feels like when I leave, I see something pop up in the corner of my eye; the feeling of someone is running towards me, or watching me.

Rarely, doors would close, but it freaked me out, i'd have very, very odd dreams, such as one I remember, I was being chased by a little girl in a very, very gloomy city street, I don't know why I still remember it, but it doesn't freak me out, even though it probably should. One thing that i've been having now that I didn't back then is sleep paralysis, and it scares me more then anything, two of them that I remember the most is this time when I felt I was being held down, there was a very, very strong pressure on my wrists, and I couldn't move my legs, I couldn't think at all, I was in shock, I woke up seconds later, but it was very scary.

One other time was very thought provoking, more then scary, it felt that I was in third person, first I was in my body, then I felt as if I was floating, but my body was still there, I was powerless but I could still see, this has made me look into sleep paralysis, and has caused me to be very interested in it.

I've been very reluctant to write this, and there were several times where I was going to just exit, but I feel as if I need to tell someone.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fq5m0/my_childhood_and_the_experiences_that_have_been/

94,The thousand yard stare.,1298349535,"The door that leads to our backyard is in our bedroom. It's the kind of door that's mostly window, and we have large blinds covering it. My cats like to look out the back door during the day, so I always keep the blinds pulled up to about a foot and a half above the floor. Last night I was brushing my teeth, getting ready for bed, when I was overwhelmed with fatigue. This happens to me sometimes, and I usually think nothing of it. I figure it has something to do with blood sugar levels dropping. So like I usually do when this happens, I walked into the bedroom and sat on the end of the bed to finish brushing my teeth. The light was off, but the TV was on, and I stared disinterestedly at it. 
I became more and more overwhelmed by physical exhaustion, and my thoughts started to feel a little fuzzy around the edges. Have you ever caught yourself staring intently at nothing? Unfocused? When I was little my mom called it the thousand yard stare. Soon I was no longer brushing my teeth, just sitting there, couldn't even pay attention to the TV anymore. My eyes drifted to the right, coming to rest on the black rectangle of night peering in from below the blinds on the door. 
I think the strangest part of what happened next was that it wasn't as if something jumped out at me, it wasn't like there was suddenly something there, so much as I gradually became aware that I was staring into the empty eye sockets of a pale face, low to the ground, peering in at me from outside the door. Once the full realization hit me my mind reeled. I was instantly filled with the deepest sense of dread and revulsion I have ever felt in my entire life. I went from dull and fuzzy feeling to full panic mode in the span of a second. How long had I been staring into that face? I let out a strangled cry and flailed backward, trying to tear my eyes away from that steady, hollow gaze. I fell off the side of the bed, breaking contact with whatever it was that was staring in at me.
As soon as my line of sight was broken a keening sound that I have never heard myself make came bubbling out of me, quickly rising to an all out wail. My husband must have recognized that this was not my normal ""eeek there's a spider!"" reaction. He came running into the room, finding me wild eyed and hysterical. I found it almost impossible to form words, just pointing to the door and babbling ""someone... something...""
He stepped to the door, and as his hand laid on the handle I found the composure to cry out ""No! Don't open it! There's something out there!"" I scrambled to my feet and crossed the room to him, trying to stop him from opening the door.
Of course he opened it. A blast of icy wind whipped into the room as he flipped on the porch light. I was shuddering with fear as we crossed the threshold out into the dimly lit yard. There are no bushes for something to hide in. There was nothing there. I felt my panic slowly start to recede, and doubt began to whisper that maybe I had imagined it. As we turned to come back in, a movement above the gutter caught our eyes. A whip thin appendage snaked its way up onto the roof and out of sight.

95,The Eye in the Knothole,1298349149,"Now I don't exactly know with 100% certainty that the thing I'm about to tell y'all about was paranormal per se, but it shook me up something fierce. One of those moments that sears into your brain and you see sometimes when you close your eyes, ya know?

My family's got a log cabin, a sort of summer cottage, only ""cottage"" is a rather generous term for it... ""shack"" might be more appropriate. Rusty well water on the tap, wood stove for warmth, and a decrepit old outhouse for doin your business in. Obviously, to keep the place nice, you build the outhouse a good distance from the cabin, so people don't gotta smell it all the time. This also means that when you wake up in the middle of the night and you really gotta go, you got a good hike ahead of you-- through dark woods.

When I was twelve, I thought I was hot shit. Had a younger brother who was afraid of his own shadow when it came to that place, I used to scare the living daylights out of him at night, and get in a good deal of trouble for it. One day we'd gotten into a decent number of fights, so instead of bunking in the same room as him, I slept in the adjacent room. I don't know what time it was I woke up, but it was plenty dark and everybody was so quiet you could hear the bugs outside, which is always disconcerting. I like to at least hear someone snoring to know the world didn't end while I was asleep. I had to go pretty bad, so I sat up and was looking for my shoes in the dark when something thumped against the wall right behind me. That was the wall to the bunk room. I ignored it, but it happened again, so curious what was going on in there, I tried taking a peek through on of the knotholes in the wall.

What the fuck did I see but a god damned eye looking right back at me. Damn thing nearly startled the shit out of me, and I hissed, ""God damnit, Ben!"" (that's my brother's name). I pounded my fist against the wall in the hopes of giving him a good rap, then fumbled through the cabin to the front door to head to the outhouse, grabbing the flashlight my father left by the door for just such an occasion.

So I headed to the outhouse and fucking everything went quiet, because you spook all the forest animals with your wavin that light around and crunching through all the branches and stuff. My brother peekin through the wall had spooked me a little, but I was generally more concerned with what would happen if I ever crossed paths with a bear out there at night.

I got to the outhouse, I went inside, and it was lit by this single, like probably 5 watt bulb that was connected by yards of extension cords to an outlet by the house that you hadta flip on. As soon as I entered, all the crickets and birds started back up their noise. I was finishing up my business a minute or two later when the light went out. At the same time, all the noise stops again. I just cursed and turned on the flashlight, figuring Ben was being an ass or maybe he got up to go and didn't know the light was already on. I pulled up my pajamas, fumbled around with the seat and then I heard someone trudging up the path. They stopped outside the outhouse and didn't make a sound. I just stood there listening for a moment, waiting for them to knock, but they never did. The edge of the door had a half knothole in it, so I took a look through that to see who it is and 

FUCK ME IT'S THAT SAME GODDAMN EYE STARING THROUGH THE KNOTHOLE AT ME. I jerked away, and now pissed I sat down and kicked the door with the flat of my foot. I heard the person stumble backward a second and then there was this sound, like a giant breath, like someone's just sucking all this air in, and then WHAM the fucking door came in like someone hit it with a battering ram. The door didn't open, mind you, it buckled. The wood splintered inward, cracked almost in half in places, but the door held. It didn't matter, because I just started yelling bl... no, I'll be honest, I was screaming bloody murder. I thought for sure I'd just pissed off the grand daddy of all bears and it was going to bust its way in and eat me. It was a good thing I'd just finished going, let me tell you.

I did not stop screaming until I heard people yelling and lots of running in my direction. I heard my mother yelling and then my father banged on the door until I unlocked it. My parents saw the door and instantly thought ""bear"". My brother Ben was still in bed, I actually scared him so bad with my screaming that he wet himself rather than get up to go.

I'll tell you though, I've seen bears since, and they don't have eyes like we've got. What I saw... who I saw... that was a human eye. At least, I think it was. And if it wasn't, what was it doing in the bunk room, peeking out at me before I went out?

One of these is from when we lived in a house in south Texas.  I was sitting in a high chair eating my breakfast (or being fed) and the sun was shining through the window across from me.  The window was covered by blinds so you couldn't see what was outside, just that the sun was up.  Suddenly I see the shadow of a man move across the window.  He seemed to be tall and was wearing a wide brimmed hat.  Being that I was still very young, I didn't really care that much about this incident since all the shadow did was move across the window and (seemingly) kept moving. I asked my mom where dad was, and she said he was in the shower.  As I got older, I began to think about this incident and I remembered that there was a flower bed directly in front of that window.  If someone had walked that close to the window, they would have trampled the flowers and my mom would have been pissed!  

In another house we had moved into later on, I also saw something strange.  I was about four years old and playing with some toys in my closet.  It was in the afternoon, but the hallway leading to my room could be very dark if no windows were left open.  So as I'm in my closet, I look out into my room and see the outline of a man made of shadows standing in the doorway of my room.  He didn't have a hat or any features, just basically an outline.  He didn't move or make a sound to indicate that he was there, he just seemed to be standing very still.  So I did what any rational four year old would do and grabbed my T-Rex gun (a gun shaped like a roaring t-rex that shot sparks out his mouth when you pulled a very phallic trigger) and shot at him.  Surprisingly, he just disappeared and never came back.

It was about a year ago when I was telling my friend about these things that he suggested they were shadow people.  I could not believe when I saw pictures of shadow people in hats that matched the description of the first one that I saw. 

Also, my mom tells me that I used to talk to someone when I was a child that she could not see.  I would tell here that it was my twin brother who had died in the womb.  I vaguely remember doing this, but from what I remember I couldn't actually see him.  I just knew that he was there and that he wanted to ""play.""  Being an only child in a senior dominated neighborhood, I was dying for a playmate.  So I either made an imaginary friend, or it really was my twin.

I have a few more like that.  Most of my experiences weren't actually scary or unnerving.  Just unusual.  I'll tell some more if you all want me to.",nosleep,RoboLobo,/r/nosleep/comments/fq0jv/strange_events_happened_growing_up_in_south_texas/

99,My grandfather,1298341054,"It was my Junior year of college, my roommates and girlfriend were sleeping and I woke up extremely early for a college student-6am hah. I had decided to listen to some Mongolian throat singing and start a paper that was due later that day. My computer faced the wall on the far corner of the room. I had started to get really into the music. Just zoning out and getting into a completely serene and meditative state. 
I felt as if someone were staring at me from the far corner of the room so I turned around. There was my grandfather who had passed 6years earlier. I turned back to computer for a split second because I just thought it was my imagination. But as I did, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned my head again and made direct eye contact with him. 
I sobbed for probably an hour and called my dad. I couldn’t get over what had happened. My dad told me that my grandfather loved throat singing and had a fascination with the art for awhile.
___________________________________________________________
Several months later I was driving in my car alone on the way back from school. I live 7 hours away from campus. The directions I had on my front seat had fallen off the chair. Windows were closed and I had not made any sudden stops. No one else was on the stretch of road. As I panned down to pick the papers up my grandfather was once again there. Sitting in the front passenger seat with a smile on his face and once again I was uncontrollably crying for 30min.

I do see him on occasion walking around my house. Or checking on one of my family members or myself. But I have never lost control of my emotions like I did those 2 days.",nosleep,redtoken,/r/nosleep/comments/fpz1p/my_grandfather/

2,My Mothers Story.,1298335535,"So, a lot of strange things have happened in my life, a lot revolving around my late grandfather of whom i never met, i thought i should start with my Mother's experiances, the origin you could say of my paranormal history and how it could have possibly spawned.

My grandfather died 20 years before i was born due to diabetes, his name was Dennis and from what i heard he was a lovely man. After he died my mother became very depressed and so started to take medication, this spiralled out of control until she turned to christianity. After several years of attending church she was offered an alternative, a group who were more accepting of her individuality, this was a so called pagan cult. When i say pagan cult i mean a bunch of adolescants who were too interested in things they shouldnt be involved with.

One night my mother and this group decided to try a ouiji bored, my mother being extremely enthusiastic about this as it could be her way of finally saying goodbye to Dennis. Apparently as soon as they began a cold air descended upon the room, sound waves fluxuating as if something was manipulating the atmosphere, after an unsuccessful session though they decided to leave it but what they had contacted did not want to leave them. 

My mother was working night shifts at the local hospital and so went straight there after this failed attempt at contact. According to her the entire night had felt wrong ever since she'd left but blamed it on the essence of death in the hospital. As she walked down an empty hallway she could feel something briskly touch the back of her neck but she shrugged it off and carried on walking. She could hear thumpings on the walls behind her but knew there was nothing there and so blamed it on her wild imagination. As the thumping grew louder she finally turned around, there was a shadow, not of her own, in fact not a shadow as it wasnt connected to a wall, ceiling or floor, a blur of darkness in a humanoid figure walking towards her, hands dragging across the walls hitting them. My mother screamed and ran, ran all the way home, having never been so terrified in her entire life, if anything she had just brought more people into danger.

The next part of the story comes from my grandmother, Sheila, as my mother claims that she blacked out, something blocking out her memories, manipulating her mind. Apparently, at around 1 o'clock in the morning, my grandmother came downstairs and found my mother in tears by the front door, as my mother looked up there was a ghoulish look in her face, her eyes glazed and diluted, her skin a shade of grey and her voice almost slightly distorted. My grandmother, being heavy christian, accepted evils presence (if god existed surely the devil did too?) and put a crucifix necklace around my mothers neck as protection. Sheila then woke up my auntie Susan and the three of them slept in my grandmothers bed, praying continuously all night until they fell asleep.

My auntie reassures me that this next event happened and after my experiances i have no other choice than to believe it. My grandmother started shaking involuntarily, gasping for air with her arms outstretched, my auntie tried to sit my grandmother up but it was as if a force was driving her down into the mattress. My auntie then looked across the bed to my mother, she was lying perfectly asleep smiling, the crucifix around her neck gone with nothing but cuts and bruises to show where it once was worn. 

My auntie suddenly slapped my mother across the face, desperate to wake her up, as soon as my mother opened her eyes my grandmother was suddenly let go, the atmosphere suddenly becoming normal, calm and friendly. They then lay there, hugging and crying all night until the next day where upon they found the crucifix in the fireplace. 

This was the first paranormal event to hit my family as far as i know but definately not the last, this was merely the tip of the iceberg, if you want to read more please do comment, my story is yet to come.",nosleep,bojorudge,/r/nosleep/comments/fpx6g/my_mothers_story/
3,Mr Bentley - Part two,1298333205,"you might recall I posted here a while ago about a story my friend told me - he lived next door to an undertakers (funeral people) and told me about Mr Bentley - this was an old man (dead) he saw out of his window one night in the garden around the funeral home. My friend said that Mr Bentley was 'made of stars'.

Anyway it seems that Mr Bentley has followed my friend to his new place, and whilst he let the dog out Bentley made himself known at the end of the garden, and my friend took a picture of him, the dog reacted very badly to encountering this and has had to be restrained indoors, likewise my friend reports smashed windows after the visit - these are cracked not put through or anything.

As soon as I get the picture I will post it up here, unless he pays me a visit as well.

This is 100% real btw no just fiction. He said the look on mr bentleys face was pure rage when he saw the apparition.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fpwca/mr_bentley_part_two/
4,Staying at a friends house.,1298331533,"Ok not my story, it's my girlfriends (H).

It happened maybe about a year ago when she was staying at a mates house, they were doing the usual friend thing, watching movies eating pizza shit like that, when they decided to call it a day and get some sleep.

She said she woke up at around 3 in the morning, with hazy vision checked her friend (J) - fast asleep. Her eyelids just started to get heavy when she heard something low pitched like whispers of a conversation from the stairs. Now at this point i should probably explain the layout of the house etc. 

It was a really old cottage, i mean really old. It used to be a pub way back when. They had posters and cuttings around the house  with 'no poking or tickling 'o' the wenches' on them. Now as you go up the set of stars to J's room at the top of the stairs to the left is the bathroom, then on the right is a really really low door to J's room that then leads to her brothers room and then finally onto her parents room at the end, next to another set of stairs leading down to the kitchen.

At this time in the morning no one was up, and if they were they would have used the other set of stairs at the other end of the house to get to the kitchen / downstairs bathroom. 

H was trying to listen in to the conversation to see if she recognized the voices to be those of J's parents or possibly brother. She couldn't make out what the voices were saying or who they were from, but they were gradually getting louder with accompanying footsteps walking up to the room. 

H is now terrified, trying to wake up J for reassurance but no such luck. The temperature of the room drops dramatically for about a minute, then nothing. All whispers stop footsteps, all gone and temperature back to normal. 

I have retold this story as i was told, J has never recalled anything else that happened there that was out of the ordinary.

One thing that did seem suspicious is after they moved on to a neighboring village, a month or two later the vacant house caught fire and burnt down. With no apparent cause

I'm trying to find location on Google earth + news story if there was one, it was a listed building so hopefully i will find something somewhere.

**EDIT** Sorry i didn't post anything more last night i fell asleep anyways location is:  51°19'14.59""N   1°29'50.89""W

5,Banishing advice,1298330114,"here is a little back story:

my ex boyfriend always thought my spiritual beliefs were a joke. fast forward to when i broke up with him after i fell in love with the guy he wanted to date. he got high and did a blood sacrifice and sent demons after me to 'make me suffer'.

now i regularly use a ouija board and tarot cards to talk to these two spirits that have protected me for a quite a while. the told me that they have been keeping a couple spirits away from me. they told me they were evil spirits and they were trying to make me suffer and that my ex boyfriend sent them. so i could no longer scoff at what he told me.

so over time my relationship was almost completely destroyed. me and my current boyfriend are on a hiatus. but the last time i talked to my guardians, which was a couple nights ago, they told me that these evil spirits are making me suffer through my relationship, that they are basically keeping me and my boyfriend apart. they also told me that these spirits are easy to get ride of ( i figured that since my guardians are having such and easy time keeping them away from me)

-----

my ex thinks that there aren't any demons because he 'prayed for them to go away"" but they are defiantly here and making my relationship with the love of my life suffer. what can i do to go about banishing these demons and getting them to leave me and my boyfriend alone?",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fpvau/banishing_advice/
6,Scary Bedroom in High School,1298329750,"I don't know what to make of what happened. But recent events have forced me to post this story.

Back when I was in high school we moved to a townhouse and I had to sleep in this small bedroom. A lot of the time I would feel uneasy in the room and would hear noises. I attributed a lot of the noise to the next door neighbor just doing whatever it was he was doing in there. Don't worry this story doesn't end with the next door townhouse being empty, it wasn't. Anyways after about a month in this room I wake up in the middle of the night and look up at the ceiling. I see these lights on the ceiling while feeling pretty scared about it. Just these green/yellow lights just swirling around. So I just slam my eyes shut and pretend it isn't there. From that point on I decided just to not look up at the ceiling at night.

  Flash forward 6 months. I finally end up looking up again. This time at around 430 in the morning. What is written on the wall in the scariest font ever (think the number 2 from Lethal Weapon 2) and in the same swirling light I see ""GET OUT"". So wasting no time and dragging all the blankets with me I haul ass out of there into the living room to watch infomercials until it is time to go to school. I refused to sleep in that room for months after that. I slept on top of couch cushions put on the ground in the basement for a while after that. It really spooked me. After a few months I sleep in there again and don't have any problems. I never told anybody why. Just that I liked the cooler air.

For my 17th birthday I was out of town for a week and my brother's room ended up being unusable due to some repairs being made. So he slept in the room one night before I get back. When I get back I see him with a ladder dismantling the ceiling light in the room and him asking me what the deal with the lights was. This shook me because I never told anybody and he seemed to believe something was in the ceiling. He said it eventually said ""HELLO BOB"" in that same scary font. 

Flash forward to college and his girlfriend ends up sleeping in the room. She ran out of the room in tears after a few hours because she saw the lights. She never told anybody what they said. I doubt they said anything to her.

All in all this isn't a very scary story until I got a phone call about a month ago. My mom has been moved out of the place for about 3 years and new people moved in. Anyways, the new tenant killed herself in that bedroom after getting more and more messed up over time. The old next door neighbor told her about it and the events leading up to it. How he would hear weeping and stuff in there. Could just be a coincidence but it was enough to shake me.

Sorry this story wasn't that scary but it all really happened.",nosleep,soptheturtle,/r/nosleep/comments/fpv6q/scary_bedroom_in_high_school/
7,The key...,1298322165,"Excuse me for my bad English, i'm not a native American Speaker/Writer...

For a school trip we went to a fabric,
It was for an art project we could snap some pictures in a few abdoned fabrics and lots.. (about 3 of them) In the last fabric I walked into a dark room, snapped a few pictures and suddently noticed a key jammed into a wall with a nail. I felt the great urge to take the key.. After a few attemts the key came loose and I grabbed it. I took it home in my pocket and told nobody...

At home a left it in my room, next to my bed. It had a strange feel to it. It felt... warm but cold I can't really explain.. I decided to hide it in the attic because of the strange feeling the key had.

I completely forgot about it, but a few days back it suddently lied on the desk in my brothers room. Staring at me, looking...

8,[NOT FICTION] Can anybody expand on this?,1298316201,"My mother isn't a very ""paranormal"" person really, she just always believed in the philosophy of ""Why tempt fate?""
She raised me the same way, and while I don't go looking for things like ghosts and UFO's I've always been open-minded regarding the subject if enough evidence is presented.
When I was perhaps 10 or 11 years old, my mother told me about her one and only ""UFO"" experience. In her later adolescent years, she and my uncle had been on a short drive. I honestly don't remember the reason or destination, they were just driving around town. While on their way back to my grandparents' house they witnessed a bright light in the sky. The description was simple enough: a large disk-like object, NOT spinning, just hovering in the air with a ring of lights on the outer edge. The lights were aimless,just shining. Naturally, my mother and uncle were a bit freaked out so they continue driving. The unidentified object apparently followed them for a while before disappearing. Not fading,not flying away,disappearing. I figured this was just some bullshit or imagined story for a while at least. A year or two later, I was attending a summer camp. Our counselors were young, late teens or early twenties, and naturally nobody actually went to sleep at ""lights out."" My counselor in our cabin somehow got on the subject of UFOs that night and as we all lay in the dark listening, he told us a story of his own experience, and incredibly he described the exact same thing my mother did. Now, I understand most descriptions of UFO's are pretty generic: disk shaped, lights, soundless,whatever. This isn't some lame attempt at a non-shocking ghost story, and as I'm currently a university student I can honestly say I don't entirely remember the exact description my mother gave me of the object to the letter. My younger self,having heard the story within a year,did however. And I remember hearing the exact same description, the EXACT same description, from some 19 year old kid. I know theres a list of possible explanations,coincidences, and its always possible to attribute error based on my age. It was, in my opinion, the sort of shock one doesnt forget as a child and I'll stick to my story no matter what. I just want to know...has anyone else had anything like this happen? I don't,nor should you, trust the physical description of the object in the sky that my mother told me of since it's been years since I heard the description from her, but has anyone had a similar experience?",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fpq9c/not_fiction_can_anybody_expand_on_this/

11,We all go a little mad sometimes.,1298308861,"True story.  

I never saw Psycho until I was out of college.  Decided to rent it one night while my roommate was out of town.  I'm a guy, about 6', 200 lbs. Not the type to let much scare me.  That said, I grew up with a family that absolutely believes in spooks.  I'll tell some of those stories someday.  My dad grew up in a seriously haunted house, so there's lots to tell.

The night I rented Psycho, I was happily digging in to McDonald's and watching the flick in complete darkness.  With the roommate gone I was hanging out in my underwear and sitting in the easy chair with my feet up.

You know the part in Psycho where Janet Leigh sits down with Norman Bates in the room with all the taxidermy?  It's got a very famous line in it.  I'd heard the line a hundred times from people quoting the flick.  It's one of those movies you feel like you've seen even if you haven't because it's so much a part of the lexicon.

This line echoed in my living room, ""We all go a little mad, sometimes.""

And at that moment, the dimmer switch in my dining room went from completely off to completely on.  Not dim to on, or off to dim.  Full turn.  I was sincerely creeped.  I stopped the DVD. I turned on ALL the lights.  I called my mom. Then I said aloud to the empty room, ""Ok.  We're gonna watch the end of the movie now.  Hope everybody has enough light,""  and continued on with the movie.

Nothing happened after that, but I wished like hell my tiny roommate was there, not because I felt she was going to scare any spooks away, but simply because I thought she might be good bait if whatever wanted the lights on felt a kinship with Norman.",nosleep,BunsenHoneydewsEyes,/r/nosleep/comments/fpnk8/we_all_go_a_little_mad_sometimes/
12,I posted this as a comment thought i might as well post it here..,1298308365,"I am a bone fide ghost junkie and thanks to you guys on nosleep i am alot more confident when spooky stuff happens to me, although my other experiences are not on the same level as this one i believe my house to be haunted wether they be malicious or not there is something spooky in this house.

Back when i first started to move into the house i now live in i always noticed that my room was colder then all the others i dismissed this as a problem with the heating. I eventually decided to address this issue as the cold became unbearable this wasn't a bit chilly i could live with chilly, my room was an ice box. So having had enough of this i got my uncle (a plumber with years of experience) in to have a look at it after a few days of him inspecting my houses heating system he said i quote 'There is no logical explanation why your room is colder then the others i would reccomend getting a bigger radiator fitted to see if that makes a difference' having my heating system checking out as fine left me puzzled. By the way it was also mid-summer at this point in time and was recorded as one of the hottest summers my region has had.

As my high school exams were coming up the problems with my room were soon forgotten and life went on. Months passed and somehow my room seemed to be getting colder and much to my annoyance one month in particular i repeatedly woke up every evening sometime around midnight dripping with sweat with no recollection of anything that could have caused me to wake up in this manner i stayed in a upright position until i cooled down which didn't take very long in my room. I usually woke up quite disorientated too as if i had been asleep for days, it was as if there were shadows dancing around my room as i stared at them in amazement too, at the time i thought it was just me hallucinating. After a few weeks of this erratic sleeping pattern for a whole week i was relieved when i slept like a baby the first day of december.

This happens every november since i moved into this house 4 years ago and seemingly at random around the year but it's these random times thats when the truly weird stuff happens, i wake up in that dazed state and looking around my room i notice someone sitting in my chair but the chair turns and no one is their as i was 14 at the time of these events i still though pulling the sheets over my head was some sort of protection after doing this and trying to fall asleep the chilling sensation in my first post returned i peeked over my sheets which was another bad descision on my part as wether it was in my head or not there looked like there was someone standing at the foot of my bed as i stared in disbelief the figure started to make their way around the side of my bed it's head fixed on me. As this was after my incident with the library i always have a flashlight by my bedside that i reached for as this figure walked towards me i flooded my room with the all welcome warmth of light from my torch but alas there was no figure to be found this now gives me ample reason to leave all the lights on in my house but when i am walking back from friends houses or gigs i feel a cold feeling on the back of my neck and i know that this mystery figure is watching me. Being the horror buff that i am i won't be moving house anytime soon. Other things have happened to me in the 4 years i have lived here but i am unsure wether to post them or not.

14,Reasons to believe.,1298298221,"This but one of many incidents that i have experienced over the years if you would like to hear more just ask, I will apologize beforehand for any spelling mistakes i may make. I would also like to say that I am a firm believer in the paranormal and will always be one.

This incident happened in a derelict library that is very close to where I live. It was around 9PM on a Saturday night and myself and 3 of my closest friends were going through that phase of breaking into abandoned places trying to get a cheap thrill. Anyway we had decided collectively that we were going to stay over at Matts (the leader of our little group) house when we were done with this building, the first signs of the night were approaching and as always we were overprepared having packed our torches amongst other things such as rope, first aid kits etc..We got in through one of the many windows on the ground floor, noticing a few empty needles on the window ledge, as always we were expecting to run into a few homeless guys trying to find somewhere to catch some sleep. 

Anyway we started making our way through this building room by room trying to no avail to find any signs of someone being here. We assumed that they had moved on or never even stayed her. Continuing around the ground floor we came to 2 flights of stairs on opposite sides of a hallway one going down the other going up, we had all switched on our flashlights by now as it was almost night time we decided as group that two should go down into the basement and two to the floors above. I pulled the short straw of going down below I put on a brave face and headed on down. My companion who decided to start telling my his life story much to my annoyance to pass the time as we made our way around the basement he was starting to seriously get on my nerves he was the one in the group who moans about everything but i digress, anyway whilst inspecting the ceiling wondering how whatever my friends were doing must be better then what we were doing down here.

I noticed that that brick work on the walls had changed from the house brick decaying red hue to some brick type I hadn't seen before. As I shined my torch around trying to find a reason for this change in achitecture I looked around the room in it's entirety I almost ran out of the building there and then but for some reason i found myself inclined to stay. There were these cages in the centre of the room a bit odd for a library basement but i am adamant that they were there. I should also note that this was not a traditional basement it was more like the type of thing you would expect too see in an old pub it was quite a long rectangluar room with low arches this also struck me as odd. On closer inspection there were some old rags and a white dust like substance around them in an circular shape like it was sprinkled in that way. My companion at this point was pestering me that we shouldn't be here and we have to go. Ignoring him i again shined my torch around the room now noticing a door seeming to have appearing out of no where, i was 100% sure that this door way was not there before upon closer inspection the door was seemingly embedded in the brickwork much like it had pushed its way through the wall. 

Once again ignoring my companions constant complaints i took it upon myself to go through the door. Placing my hand on the door knob and I instantly felt that there was something wrong as the door had an icy cold air around the door debunking this as a draft coming from whatever was behind the door. Opening the door my torch started flickering as the door creaked open before completely going out looking up at the now open doorway has haunted me ever since i saw what was emerging from the darkness. As it's haggard hand clamped around the door frame it slumped into the pool of light coming from my friends torch, and thick black mane of wiry hair covered most of its decaying face this 'thing' towered above me almost too big for the doorway, the claw like nails present on it's hands dug into to the timber of the doorframe i could hear the wood creaking as the creature gripped it. Being in a temporary state of paralysis at who or what was shambling towards us gave me time to observe something that i wish i hadn't, the shadows behind the creature were moving not like someone was walking around. It looked like there were things floating in the darkness. Seconds felt like hours as the shadows crept towards me seemingly absorbing everything in their path as the light from the torch waned. Any chance of debunking this as a seriously deformed homeless person were obliterated as my eyes met with the black holes where the creatures eyes should have been, its mouth that was filled with filthy razor sharp teeth opened omitiing the most horrific blood curdling scream I have ever heard. This scream broke the spell we were under we sprinted out of that hell hole as fast as we could never looking back. 

We kept this incident between us never telling anyone this seemed like smart idea at the time but this sighting haunted me for months after it actually happened. The weekend after walking back from another friends house it was getting pretty dark, paranoia had always been present but since the library i have been constantly looking over my shoulder expecting to see that creature i continued to do this until i finally got home and a triumphant smile came to my face as if i had beaten whatever was in that basement. I turned away from my door looking in the libraries direction just making out it's gothic features in the darkness and for reasons that to this day i do not know i continued to stare at it i felt a chilling sensation descend over me as if something was watching me i scanned the darkness in vain to find something anything, but i knew what was watching me in the darkness and then as if they knew i was looking for them out of the corner of my eye i saw them moving, mocking me.

For those of you who haven't read my last post, you should probably read that before reading this. (sorry if I'm stating the obvious.) lol



Anywho, a year after the EVP was caught, strange stuff started happening around the house. My famiy is Christian, and while my mom was cleaning the house, she would often have Christian music playing on her radio and more often than not, the music would randomly fuck up and sound really creepy or the radio would unplug itself. My parents would just kinda let it go an go about their days, but it freaked me out. So one morning, some family friends' from church came over from breakfast and as usual, before leaving the house they said a prayer. We all got in a circle and held hands, y'know the usual stuff. About a minute into the prayer, one of the ladies that I didn't know started speaking in tounges and started to freak out. I heard her crying and usually I would keep my eyes closed during prayer, but I was too freaked out to leave my eyes closed. I see the lady rolling on the ground, crying and freakin the fuck out. I didn't know what to do! We all just waited there to see what happened and evenually, she calmed down. Her eyes were bloodshot. She turned to look at me and said ""there is somethig in this house. Someone let it in!"" I knew what she was talking about, and as she said that, I felt like my stomach was beig dragged down to my feet. It was fucking insane. 

I still haven't a clue as to who the lady was, but all I know is that after seeing her eyes staring into mine and hearing those words being spoken, it was enough to keep me from sleeping for a while.  ",nosleep,MelissaMacabre,/r/nosleep/comments/fpibh/follow_up_story_to_my_house/
18,Unlocked doors,1298288468,"I used to live in a really old (120 years) house. I lived there for about 3 years and at least 2-3 times a month I would wake up and the front and back doors would both be wide open and I always made sure they were locked. Every night. Without fail.

So this may not sound creepy, but whenever this would happen, the day after I would have a power outage :S.

It really creeped me out and eventually I decided I needed to move.

Can anyone explain what the hell was happening, I researched the house and there's been no murders or anything there?",nosleep,swillyboi,/r/nosleep/comments/fpi5j/unlocked_doors/

20,My house,1298279399,"First of all, I want to appologize in advance if this gets to Be ridiculously long. I just want to make sure I tell it right. But anyway..





I want to begin with personal encounters since those are always the best. About 2 or 3 years ago I heard my mom freaking out because she had seen a lady walk into her bathroom. My mom only saw her through the mirror and she claims that the lady looked a lot like me. So after she realized that it wasn't me (I was still sleeping) she started getting scared. So being a fan of the paranormal, I invited my little brother to come join me to see if we could talk to it. I sat down on the bed, and I put up my cell phone to the recording feature and started asking questions. I began by asking if there was anyone there with us and if so, we asked it to knock three times. I wait.. Then I hear three knocks. I couldn't believe it so my first thought was that maybe my little brother was trying to troll me. So I tell him to keep his arms and legs were I could see them and I try again. I get three fucking knocks.. I ran the fuck outta there. 

Well, not even 5 minutes went by and I decided 'Hey, let's go try that in my room!' bad idea. I go in there (it was 3pm) I sit on the bed with My brother and I start recording and asking questions. My firs question was: ""is there anyone here with us? If so, could you please tell me if you are a man, woman or child?"" I waited a couple of seconds just in case I got a response and then I continued by asking it's age. I didn't really get too into it because I didn't expect to catch anything. About a minute later, I start listening to my recording.. Everything seemed normal until I asked if it was a man, woman or child. About 3 seconds after the question I hear a voice say ""a child.."" it didn't sound like a kid. It sounded like the voice of a man in his 30's. I couldn't believe it. I grabbed my headset to make sure I wasn't just hearing shit but even after I did, the same creepy whisper among static remained. I wanted to cry. I ran to show my mom and she was freakin' pissed. She gave me a lecture about how it's just like playing with a ouija board. 

2) This happened after the EVP was caught. It was 3am and I was lying in bed talking to my boyfriend at the time. Now, I'd like to make it known that this was about a year after the EVP was caught because I refused to sleep in my room for a long time. Anyway, so I was talking to him about random shit when I hear something being dragged across my desk. I didn't pay much attention to it until it was to the point where it sounded like someone was pressing down really hard while dragging it across the desk and then it just slid and made a loud noise when it hit the floor. My ex heard it through the phone. I was too freaked out to stand up and turn on the light but after a while I grew a pair and I managed to quickly turn on the lights to see a cup that I had left on my desk, on the floor. I just crawled back into bed and stayed up for the rest of the night.

22,"Well, we're not buying this house.",1298274850,"Background:

My wife and I decided that we need to buy a house now that we have a child. Anyone who has bought a house knows that this is extremely stressful and time consuming, and after you've looked at 9 houses in 7 hours, they all start to blend together in your mind, and you can't remember what each one looked like at the end of the day. 

Our solution was to take as many pictures as possible, move a couple feet, take a picture, enter a room, take a picture, turn around, take a picture. If we weren't snapping pictures every couple seconds, we would get distracted and forget to take any. So, too many pictures is clearly better than too few. My wife has her phone, I have my phone, and our good friend Jason sacrificed his Saturday and came along to use a digital camera.

After each house, the pictures were uploaded to my laptop from each of our cameras.

Interesting part:

I love looking at houses, its fun. I *hate*  looking through houses that aren't vacant. In case you aren't familiar with how this works: If a house isn't vacant, the realtor will schedule a time for the owners to leave, so that prospective buyers can walk through the house without feeling watched. But the thing is, you still feel like an intruder, you're encroaching on the most personal area of someones life.

This particular house is owned by a family who must be desperate to sell it, because they agreed to vacate at a half-hour's notice after dark(long story) so that we could look around.

 There was an air of uneasiness in this house, along with feeling like an intruder in this particular house, I also felt... watched. It is really hard to describe, like the walls themselves were watching me. It wasn't just me, we all voiced our feelings about this as soon as we crossed the threshold, even the realtor. Once we got inside, we started with our routine, we would spread out and snap pictures of whatever was in our line of sight, paying special attention to any sort of damage.

[This girl's room](http://kromagnon.imgur.com/bedroom2) was noticeably cooler than the rest of the house, a good 10 degrees colder, I spent little time in this room, it wasn't a pleasant place to be.

Nothing eventful happened in the house. That we noticed. In fact, you probably didn't notice as you looked through those pictures. I didn't either, not until today. I really wish my wife hadn't pointed out to me that horrible,horrible doll in the grey dress.

23,The Bedroom,1298272576,"Let me start off this post by saying that this is a 100% true personal experience of mine and I'm currently typing this up from my phone as I lay in bed in the bedroom where this all took place.

This is my girlfriends bedroom and I come visit/sleep over often. She has her own apartment in a small town in central IL. I've always been interested in the paranormal since I was young. My interest grows and grows to this day. I will post more experiences I've had within a day or so.

So back on topic now... 

One night we layed down to go to sleep and my girlfriend falls asleep before me 99% of the time. One night I was not able to fall asleep for the life of me. I finally got the weird idea in my head to turn on the my phones camera and film the dark room( i have the iphone 4 with the bright LED light on it) to see if i can catch anything unusual, just for a good scare/thrill. I got way more than what i bargained for. Judge it how you will but I kept seeing a lot of ""orbs"" fly around randomly.
Reminder: me and my gf are the only two people in our apartment and shes asleep so its dad quiet except for the occasional passing car outside. If these were bugs or dust they were travelling awfully quietly and fast in the most random directions. There werent 5 or 6 orbs travelling at the same time, the most I remember seeing at one time would be about 2 orbs.

I know a lot of these orb stories are dismissed as a load of bullshit but wait, it gets better.

I saved all the videos on my phone ( dont have them on here at the moment considering this was around august/september last year and im constantly taking pics/videos off my phone and transferring them over to my computer.

After seeing these ""orbs"" I was pretty freaked but i didnt feel any reason to be on alert as if i were going to be harmed. It kinda just felt like these ghosts (or whatever you want to label them as) were just there wandering aimlessly. So finally my eyes started to shut and i turned my phone off at went to sleep.

The next day after work, i showed my girlfriend the videos id taken the night before. She was pretty freaked out too but also intrigued.
So that night as were getting ready for bed she calls me over and asks me to turn off the light and come lay down with her to record some more and see what we catch. Sure enough the orbs appeared again.
At one point in the video my girlfriend says ""Look! It's coming towards you."" Which one actually did get pretty close to me as it flew around our tv and jotted straight for me. We layed there in the dark and continued to watch these orbs fly about. After a while we got our fix of the paranormal, turned the camera off, snuggled up in bed and watched some tv together. We soon fell asleep and before we knew it, it was morning time, she had to go to work and i had the day off, so being the lazy bum i felt like being, i slept in til about noon. Little did i know what was going to happen next...

I got up, put my contacts in, threw on a t shirt and sweat pants, grabbed something to eat from the kitchen and hopped back in bed to watch tv. Now we have a closet in our bedroom and the door is always open. As I'm sitting on the bed, out of the corner of my eye i see a singler hanger swinging back and forth, back and forth. I shot up from the bed and threw my plate of whatever i was eating towards the edge of the bed and hauled ass out of the apartment. Call me a whimp but man, Fuck. That. I know for a fact that all our windows were shut and our ac was not on, the temperature in the apartment was perfect, no wind circulating whatsoever. On a side note: there were about 4-5 hangers with not a single piece of clothing on them including the one swinging back and forth. So now i have a question for you my fellow no sleepers? How in the fuck does one empty hanger in the middle of 4-5 empty hanger decide its going to move on its own?

I stayed outside for about 10-15 minutes, heart racing, desperately trying to come myself down. I paced trying to take it what i just saw... I mean i've seen some freak shit in my life but i wasnt alone during my previous experiences. This one specifically got to me and shook me to my core. I finally grew the courage to walk back into the apartment and it just had such a different feel to it. I felt like the walls had eyes. Like i was being watched and there was nothing i couldnt do or no where i could go without this ""ghost"" knowing exactly what i was doing. So me being me, i whipped out my phone and started recording, nothing happened much after that. I just sat alone quietly in the living room recording but nothing happened except for a few random creeks and noises here and there.

24,Why I don't trust Chinese Graveyards,1298270837,"First off, I'm telling this secondhand, so it may not be as good. An old family friend once told me this story when, for some reason I have never been able to guess, we were talking about our greatest fears and scary stories. This guy's name is Mike and nothing really ever scared him. He was this big guy with tattos on his arms and fingers, always wore black, had an awesome mustance, etc. Anyway, so he told us this story about his adventure with a chinese graveyard: He grew up in a small town in the middle of west Texas. So, nothing really to do. So on Halloween, he and his buddies got bored off egging people's houses and jumping out of bushes to scare girls (not exactly the nicest guy). So they drove out to the scarest place they could think of. An old chinese graveyard. Apparently, it was built when a bunch of chinese immigrants came over and moved to Texas. That small town was a settlement place. Anyway, they were going to break in and pee on graves, maybe egg the caretaker's house, you know. So the driver pulls up in front of the entrance and turns off the car. The moment he does, Mike said he felt a chill run over him. He said he and his other buddy in the back seat were both pysically shaking. They begged the driver to just forget it and drive away. The driver gave in and tried to start the car. It didn't start. He tried it for about five minutes, and it just wouldn't stop. He told Mike and the others in the car to get out and push. They pushed it about ten feet away from the enterance, and the driver suddenly tried to start it. It worked. The driver, who was getting a kick out of it, asked the boys to push the car back in front of the enterance, he tried it. Didn't work. He asked them to push it bakcwards away from the enterance. About ten feet away, the car started. The driver made them do it several times with the same result, until Mike finally forced him to drive away. He said that once they turned the street, the cold feeling lifted off of him. That, he said, was the most scared he had ever been in his life.",nosleep,alwayssmileback,/r/nosleep/comments/fperq/why_i_dont_trust_chinese_graveyards/
25,The old mill... True Story,1298268349,"We stood just off to the side of the train tracks.  We were trespassing, but we didn't care.  She wanted to learn to perceive things like I was able to.  The old mill stood just across the river, lit up brightly, as they operated all hours of the day and night.  Where we stood, the lights of the old mill cast just barely enough light for us to see.  The moon was obscured under heavy clouds.  The smell of rain was in the air.

She looked at me, puzzled.  ""How do I see what you want me to see?""

""That is for you to figure out.  Just concentrate. Close your eyes.  Try to feel the energy of the mill.  You tell me what you see.""

She took a deep breath just as a gust of wind blew down the length of the train tracks.  She closed her eyes and exhaled.  In the dim light, I could see her arms raising towards the old mill.  Her eyelids started to quiver, as if she was in REM sleep, the dream state.

""I... I see... feel..."" She paused for a few moments, her eyes still closed with lids quivering. ""I feel it.""

Suddenly, she froze deathly still.  She still stood in the same pose, bolt upright with arms outstretched towards the old mill.  Her eyelids were still closed, but no longer moving.  Her lips quivered slightly, as though she were trying to speak but couldn't.

I could feel a massive amount of energy from her.  This place has always been haunted, but rarely have I ever felt this sort of ethereal energy - and never from a living person.  I actually started to get a little scared, a little concerned.  I hoped I could snap her out of it if I needed to.  She had reacted to this place so much more strongly than I'd ever seen or heard about.  I waited.  What was going to happen?

She continued in her apparent paralysis state as minutes seemed to turn into hours.  I let her be, since I hadn't seen any signs that it was getting to be too much for her.  She'd always proven to be a pretty strong soul.

Suddenly, after what felt like hours, but was only a mere five minutes, according to my watch, she let out a visceral scream.  Once the initial scream ended, she just cried weakly, ""Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Please turn it off.  I'm being ground alive!""

The initial scream caused me to take a few steps back.  I had not expected that.  My first experience at the mill had not been that violent.  When she started pleading, I knew exactly what experience she was having - far more vividly than I had it.  I experienced it as an outsider.  She experienced it as the victim.

In the 1950s, a worker had fallen into one of the grinders in the mill and had been killed.  That seemed to be what she was experiencing.

I grabbed her shoulder and shook it, calling her name.  ""Nikki, wake up!  WAKE UP!""  She started screaming again.  I'm sure she felt as though she was being ground alive.  ""Nikki!  Wake up!  Come out of it!"" She didn't wake up.  I was forced to slap her, hard, on the cheek.

The screaming stopped. ""Wha... what.... what happened?""  She was obviously disoriented, and quite winded.  ""I feel... I...""

""Drink some water.  Sit down.""  I was worried about her.  She had just experienced that tragedy far more intensely than anyone I know of since the actual victim.

She sat on the disused rail track and sipped the water, slowly regaining her breath and composure.  Her gaze switched between me and the mill for several minutes.  What I could see of the look in her eyes from the dim light told me that she was confused, not sure if she should be scared or angry.

After a while, she looked up at me and said quietly, ""I fell into the grinder.  I was being ground alive.  It was horrible.""

""It was not you,"" I said softly, stroking her hair.  ""You just experienced what the victim felt.  It happened in the 1950s.""

""It was so real,"" she said. ""I could feel the jaws grinding my body to death.  One guy ran to shut off the machinery, but he wasn't going to get there in time. I knew that - I don't know how, but I did.  The other guys wanted to help, but they knew they couldn't.""  She started crying.  ""I... I just... just knew I was going to die.""

She was one of my students at the time.  My friends regarded me as some sort of spiritual master.  I only trained those that I felt were strong in the spiritual sense.

She had experienced far more than I had intended her to.  The strong soul that she was, this never discouraged her from learning and experiencing more.  Several years later, when I started doing paranormal research, she joined my team, without question, as the lead psychic.  Her abilities far exceeded anyone else on the team.",nosleep,obsidian468,/r/nosleep/comments/fpe4g/the_old_mill_true_story/

28,My old radio,1298263748,"I'm a definite skeptic, and we've managed to debunk just about every ""ghost"" occurrence (razor turning on while unplugged and in a drawer, hair dryer turning itself back on, etc...) except this one.

When I was younger, I managed to convince my parents to set up my dad's old radio/turntable in my room. This was a large metal and wood set, and came with two large speakers. What's important to note is that this radio didn't have buttons; it had hard switches for things like power and AM/FM toggle, and metal knobs for volume, balance, etc... We had debunked a TV turning itself on based on static hitting the on button, which wouldn't work for a hard toggle switch.

I've always been a bit OCD, and I would always turn off everything on the radio whenever I would shut it down: power off, all other toggles down, all volume at 0, bass and treble at 0, balance all left (it was the knob turned all the way counter clockwise), the radio dial set all the way left (before any of the stations started, around the 87.5 range), etc... 

My grandmother was minding my brother and me that night, and we were downstairs watching TV, when the radio suddenly came on, full blast. We owned no pets at the time, and we were all in the same room. No one else was in the house. My brother would have also been about 4-5 at the time, too young to operate the radio properly.

I ran upstairs to hear the radio pumping at full volume, coming from both speakers. This means that the hard toggle switch had been lifted up, the volume cranked in the direction opposite to how my OCD-self put it, the speakers rebalanced, and the tuner set to an actual station.

Still can't explain it.

I was taking a nap and I had a dream that me and you were going camping with your friends (I saw the video where they said ""you should go camping with us""). Anyway, we were both in the backseat of a van, me in the middle and you in the way back. I was complaining about how my iPhone died then I turned around and looked at you. J started to goof around with you by getting down as low as I could Till only my eyes were peaking over the seat. Later on I got really excited; we were passing a destroyed building (still standing but windows were missing and broke ) and I said ""look zach! That's where I used to live!"" I pointed beyond the building and said ""that's the farm I told you about"". Soon after we parked and got out of the car, we were in a really weird city with building 100 stories high but on a couple feet wide. The dream ended with us walking through a doorway to a public pool and you angrily pushing me in. I hit my head on cement and I woke up.

I'm starting to think that when i dream i am going into the same astral plain because i'm seeing the same environment but in different locations, because listen to this. that building i was pointing at, i had a dream a while ago that i was in that building and i was in a hotel room that was facing the farm i was pointing at and when i went the the farm there was a destroyed house, it burned down in a fire and all that remained was a charred frame and there was very tall wheat-like grass everywhere. and in the dream earlier today i was about a few blocks away from the building and the destroyed house telling you to look at it.  and i've also had this other dream where i'm in this building and i keep walking down this hallway, down a stair case and into this mechanic garage to a bathroom. every time i have that dream i see a little more, i have determined that i was going to the bathroom to look at my full body sunburn (in the dream)",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fpc52/dreams/

Anyways, I broke my arm about 4 weeks ago from a snowboarding accident, and after the surgery to screw together my bones I've been taking some pretty intense pain meds. So for the first week I had to take the pain meds because I couldn't sleep without taking them (lol nosleep), but I stopped after a week b/c I didn't want to get addicted. (Note*: during the time that I was on pain meds I experienced nothing unusual at all)

So on the third week after I broke my arm, (basically 1 whole week without any exposure to pain meds), I had this experience that DEFINITLY wasn't a dream, but I can't really explain it any other way.

\start story


I am lying in bed sleeping pretty comfortably, and nearing unconsciousness but still aware of my surroundings. 

I hear a light rustling noise, like someone is gently walking past--brushing their leg on the side of the bed--just barely disturbing the bedsheats. I feel a gentle tug on my blanket, but I dismiss it.
I was nearly asleep so the sound didn't really bother me in my dazed and inebriated state. My mind didn't bother to process what I've felt.

A few moments later, I felt a slight pressure on my chest, like two small hands--the pressure slowly moves to cover my whole body--as if a small child is carefully trying to crawl ontop of me, perhaps over me, in order to avoid waking me up. I wondered if my brother (8) had accidentally wandered into my room and mistaken it for my parents.

My suspicions seem to be confirmed as I hear a light whisper:                ""mama""

As I opened my eyes in response to this unfamiliar stimulus I see--nothing.

There is nothing ontop of me.

Without realizing, the pressure on my chest has disappeared--leaving no trace of whether it was only a dream or something more.

When you're alone it's there: watching you.  You can feel its eyes boring into the back of your head, but when you turn, it has faded out of existence.  Yet the dread remains.  You'll never see it, hear it, touch it, taste it, or smell it coming... but you know it's there.  But it can see you.  It can see your thoughts, your actions, your motives, and fears.  It will exploit them.  It will invade your thoughts, your dreams, and your subconscious.  You will always look over your shoulder when you feel its presence, always tear up when you hear a noise in the night, and always worry that when you let your guard down, it will attack.

40,[NOT FICTION] This is something that really happened to me. ,1298236739,"This isn't anything too exciting but it's completely true. It happened a while ago. It sure may have been some kind of sleep paralysis or my imagination but here goes: 

One time I had woken up to a loud growling sound and my bed covers we're violently jerked off me. I was scared for a second but then I though OK maybe my dog was out of his cage and he was pissed for some reason. I looked around and found that he was not anywhere to be found. 

At this point I thought, OK this is some shit I better get up and turn my computer screen on and I got on reddit to calm my nerves a bit. I was feeling much more relieved after reading a bit about sleep paralysis and I decided that that's what it must have been even though it certainly didn't feel like it (I'm pretty aware when I'm having sleep paralysis). 

However, this is when I saw my doorknob turn slowly a full turn, stop, then slowly turn all the way back. I was fucking scared. I just sat there staring at my door in disbelief. I thought, OK a parent must have decided to check in on me and then at the last moment decided to not go in. Well the next day I asked and they told me that they had slept through the whole night and didn't do this. No one else was in my house but them.

Another occurrence, as I was lying in my bed I saw and heard a person walking in my living room and then enter my kitchen. I was a little frightened by this but it's common of my parents get up and walk around at night to get Tums or something. Anyway, I for some reason chose to get up and follow them, whomever it was, and found that no one was in the kitchen and my parents were sound asleep. Very odd.

43,"Just a thought, based off the recent post from wdalphin",1298228774,"[Here is Wdalphin's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fohy0/thank_you_nosleepers/)

I am not sure how to introduce this idea, but I wll give it my best shot. Wdalphin recently published a story about a paranormal ghost stalking him and his family. It was a great read, and I implore his writing skills.

That being said, he addresses in his follow up post that he received multiple PM's, comments, and very concerned messages from people. From Ghost Survival and Communication tactics to the possibility of CO2 poisoning. Many of these people really believed that he was in danger, and in true Reddit fashion, were willing to help out.

This is a beautiful thing, and is great, but obviously lead to a followup post about how the story was not true. Of course we should not have to do that every time a story is posted, so here is my solution.

At the end up each story, a simple ""Based of possible events"" or even ""Dramatization"" indicating a work of fiction would help. I love reading a story, and sustaining disbelief during the reading, but afterward the real scare is from all the similarities to your own life, or the fact that something like that could happen to you. 

For all the naysayers out there who think this would hurt our established subreddit, think of the *Scary Stories* series. Everyone here loved them and enjoyed reading them very much. Hell, I am still scared from the Scarecrow Story, years later. Even though I no longer believe it actually happened, the idea of it is what scares me. Nothing is taken away from that story because I know it is fictionalized.

This will also not disprove the idea of the paranormal, in fact I believe it would strengthen it. The truly good stories are what makes the front page. The ones that make you think 'Wow, I wonder...'. We have a pool of talented writers here, everyone who can make the paranormal real and closer.

On another note, I do not believe that 'fiction' should be in the title or early on. I do enjoy suspending my disbelief, wondering what is going to happen. 

Please do comment, especially if you are going to downvote. I want to know why this is a bad idea, and what I can do to strengthen it. Thank you.

TL;DR: A small message at the end indicating that it is a work of fiction, so it does not take away from the story but manages to put concerned redditers to ease.


EDIT: Idea from Giobebop 

&gt;This is a good idea, but may detract from the stories. Part of the mystique of a good horror story is the wondering over whether it was true or not. Instead, how about there was some kind of safe word, or disclaimer to indicate that something very serious is really happening:

46,My Aunt's House,1298203222,"
Just a warning to those looking to be spooked, there is no sensational ending.  No knife on the nightstand, no mysterious woman in a child's closet -- just general creepiness of what I suppose was a ghost.  And despite this /r/ becoming more of a place to deposit short fiction (some of it is really good), this story is 100% true from my recollection.

When I was 15-16, sometime right before I got my first vehicle, I was babysitting my two cousins at my aunt's house.  They lived just down the road, but their house had been in our family for 3+ generations.  It was old, and needed serious work.  My aunt and uncle were in the middle of rennovating the downstairs bathroom and garage, can't remember if they did much with the upstairs.  Anyway, the girls were 5 and 3(she may have been 2, can't remember), and both stayed in the same room in separate beds upstairs.

I was downstairs watching television when my grandmother showed up to visit.  We all lived very close, and my grandmother has a habbit of just popping in anywhere for a couple minutes to chat.  So while we're sitting and talking, we hear something take off upstairs.  Like rapid footsteps.  The way it moved didn't sound like a run, it's stride was too small.  The sound came from directly above my head, which was my aunt and uncle's room.  Naturally I just figured the youngest was up just running around, which now that I think about it was not like her at all.  

My grandmother and I decide to go up and check.  At the top of the stairs is my aunt's door, and I swear to everything I was -right- at the door, about to open it, I hear the youngest begin to scream bloody-freaking-murder.  I look at my grandmother and ask, ""Is that a mouse or something?""

She kind of gave me this half-cocked grin and said, ""Sounds way too big to be a mouse.""  Note: my grandmother is not the type of person to fuck with people.  

For some reason, instead of going into my aunt's room we go down and check in with the girls.  We flip the lights on and the youngest is beet-red in the face, still screaming, and in her older sister's bed latched onto her.  She was scared.  Of what?  I didn't know.  It took us maybe 15 minutes to get her calmed down and back into her bed, and in that time the running must have stopped because we just went right downstairs without even thinking about it.  My aunt came home a couple minutes later and I walked home.

I completely forgot that it happened within probably an hour.  The next day I was back down at my aunt's house and she goes, ""So, your grandmother tells me you met our ghost?""

Suddenly the memories popped right back, that -thing- running around upstairs.  She then went on to explain to me all of this creepy shit that had recently started to happen around the house.  The first thing was that they heard this loud crashing noise upstairs while they were downstairs.  They mentioned it being equal to a large television hitting the floor.  When they ran upstairs and got to the room, everything was as they had left it.

My aunt would talk about how they would hear the same rapid foot-steps upstairs while they were downstairs.  There was a sofa at the bottom of the stairs, and she says that sometimes you would see a shadowy figure standing at the top of the stairs out of the corner of your eye, and it would just take off like it was running a fucking marathon.  Sometimes their dog, one of the most gentle, nicest creatures I've ever encountered, would begin freaking out at the bottom of the stairs.  He would bear his teeth, his mohawk would stand up, and then growl and bark for 10-20 minutes straight.  You couldn't get him to stop, and even if someone went upstairs (when he would usually follow), he would not budge.  

At night the rapid footsteps could be heard outside of my aunt's bedroom, and then it would start running up and down the stairs.  She and my uncle would count the steps of it gowing all the way down and then all the way up.  

The last creepy thing I remember happening is their oldest daughter (she was 5, remember) was just talking to someone with no one in the room.  I didn't think it was weird, I still talk to myself and I'm almost 25.  But my aunt said it struck her as very strange, and when she entered the room my cousin acted strange.  My aunt sat down to speak to her, to ask her what was going on, and my cousin asked, ""Mom, who's Ruthie?""

Ruthie was a great-great aunt, or cousin or something, that used to live in the house a long time ago.  No one ever mentioned her to my cousin, this was before my aunt and uncle began speaking out-loud about their suspicions of a ghost.

I didn't babysit them again for a long time.  I always made excuses so I didn't have to be there, especially at night.  It's dissapointing that I never went into my aunt's room that night, had I even thought it was a ghost then, well, I was younger and probably would have chickened out.  But these days I would cut somebody for the chance to maybe see something like that.  I generally don't believe people's ghost stories as they can be a lot of things, but the sincerity of my aunt's story had me convinced.

If ghost's exist I believe they are super-rare, maybe I missed my chance to see one.",nosleep,Ecto_1,/r/nosleep/comments/foyc7/my_aunts_house/

48,This short fable sometimes keeps me up at night - and it has been at least 25 years since I read it for the very first time,1298200975,"&gt;In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the highest and most mendacious minute of ""world history"" — yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die.

&gt;One might invent such a fable and still not have illustrated sufficiently how wretched, how shadowy and flighty, how aimless and arbitrary, the human intellect appears in nature. There have been eternities when it did not exist; and when it is done for again, nothing will have happened.

51,The 3d grid guy,1298192658,"When I was a kid, I kept having these very uneasy experiences. I don't think much of them these day, but reading /r/nosleep has me wondering if anyone has any explanations for the experiences.

I shared a room with my twin sister. I don't recall if I ever spoke to her or anyone about what happened. I was probably 5-6 at the time. My parents were extremely strict, and never let me or my sister watch horror movies or anything of that nature. The house is really small. It was quite cramped for my family (Mom, Dad, Sis, and myself). 

I would awaken abruptly early in the morning (sometimes due to the pokes, explained later) to a 3d grid like man standing at the bottom of my bed (the grids were 3d like and looked green in color, however I could see completely through each square. Each cube being approximately 1 square inch in size) The figure was of a man, but no features were extinguishable other than the face which consisted of more denser grids. The figure wouldn't say a word, but would extend his hands outward toward me. When his hands reached my torso, he would tickle me.  I would close my eyes and open them again. Every time, the figure was not there on second glance. This happened to me countless times. I would say probably every other week or so. 

Sometimes I would get a poking sensation. It felt like I was being poked through my bed. The poking was not just ur average poke, it was very forceful and sometimes I would feel pain from how hard the pokes were. When I felt the pokes, they would be 2-3 pokes at a time, and sometimes continuous. I was so horrified of the pokes, after the first poke I would jump up out of bed and stare at the spot in the bed where I felt the poke came. Nothing was ever there. 

Sometimes, I would awake from the pokes only to see the grid like man standing at the end of my bed. I knew the figure was staring at me, but the eye's weren't distinguishable.. I just knew they were there and looking right at me. I've never heard of anything else like this.

54,Why i refuse to go into movie stores.,1298184938,"Heres a little bit about me. I'm a big tough guy, i dont get scared easily. 

About 3 or 4 years ago i had a job at a movie rental place. I was working with a buddy of mine and we would always close with each other and we both believe in the paranormal. So we would mess with each other. We both had keys to the store and if one of us was closed by ourselves, the other would sneak in and try to scare one of us. 

This was fun for a while, until one night we were closing together.
He is in the office in the back of the store counting money and im up front running the paperwork for the day. 

He calls me from the office and asked if i turned the thermostat down at all. I told him i didn't (which i didn't) but i knew what he was talking about. It was cold in there, like teeth chattering cold. 

The store is all windows, but it was mid-July. It was still about 70 degrees outside around 11 pm.

He comes back up front and we are just talking about what we wanted to do that night. Then we hear a thump and a groan, not a normal groan, more like a groan and a screech. We can hear dragging in the ceiling. So he goes to investigate.

Now hes a smaller guy so he can maneuver into the ceiling to check it out. 

Im watching him crawl through the ceiling and i can see the tiles shifting where he is. He tells me there is nothing up there and says hes coming back down. I see the tiles moving as he crawls back to the office. Then i see the tiles shifting coming back towards me. So i yell at him to get back up front, I'm starting to get freaked out by now. I see him some through the back door and he looks at me and i was ghost white. I tell him to look at the ceiling and we both watch the tiles moving. It stops all of a sudden. Then we heard the bathroom door slam shut. Theses doors were heavy doors and didnt slam, they closed very slow by themselves and whatever was hooked to the you couldn't slam, it was impossible. But we hear a loud slam, so i go to see if someone is still in the store. I checked both bathrooms and they are empty. The office is locked and closed. I come back out and he is shaking, He told me the gum ball machine just dropped a single gum ball. I told him its been messed up for a while, not to worry about it. So we finish cleaning up etc. The a hear the handle on the gum ball macing crank and we both look over and the handle is actually moving. This is one of those big ass machines. full of at least 1000 gum balls. The handle stops cranking and the entire dome of gum balls completely emptied onto the floor. Then we heard a child laughing. We basically hauled ass out of there. We both jumped into his truck and drove as fast as we could to get off the property. 

I had to reopen in the morning, i wasn't thrilled to have to clean up this mess. I unlocked the door and all the cold air from the night before rushed out. Sent chills down my spine. Everything came rushing back from the night prior. 

The weirdest part....there were no gum balls on the floor. The machine was still empty. I looked all over the store for the gum balls, and couldn't find them. I went back into the storage room to grab a bag to fill the machine back up. All the boxes of gum balls were gone. I knew we had just gotten truck in so we had 5 or 6 boxes the night before.

I quit shortly after that. 1 week after quiting, the store was shut down. No explanation what so ever.",nosleep,nomolos619619,/r/nosleep/comments/fovyl/why_i_refuse_to_go_into_movie_stores/

He said, 'OK Bob, how about Clint Eastwood? Do you know him?'
'Oh sure ', said Bob. 'He and my Dad shoot pheasant together and he's a great guy.'
'OK, prove it', said his boss. 'Let's fly out to Hollywood and you can introduce me.'
'Great!', said Bob. And so they did. They took a taxi to Mr. Eastwood's estate, Bob knocks on the door, Mr. Eastwood opens it and shouts, 'Bob! Hey, great to see you! You and your friend come on in and have lunch.' 
Bob's boss was impressed, but still skeptical. When they left after lunch, he said, 'That was a coincidence that you knew Clint Eastwood. How about President Bush?'
'Sure, I know him', replied Bob. So, they fly off to Washington, DC and head to the White House.
As they are touring the grounds, Mr. Bush sees Bob and comes right over saying, 'My gosh, Bob, I haven't seen you in a couple years. Come on in, have some coffee and let's catch up.'
After a couple hours, Bob and his boss are escorted off the White House grounds and Bob asks his boss, 'Well, do you believe me now?'
His boss, shaken and a bit bewildered, but still not completely convinced says, 'I'll believe you if you show me you know one more person - the Pope.'
'Certainly', says Bob, 'I've known the Pope since I was just a little kid. Let's fly over to Italy.'
So, off to Rome they fly and join a mass of people in Vatican Square waiting to catch a glimpse of the Pope. Bob says, 'There's no way I can get the Pope's attention with all these people here. How about if I go talk to one of the guards I know and then I'll come out on the balconey with the Pope to prove to you I know him.'
Bob's boss waits as Bob heads off into the crowd. About 15 minutes later, the Pope emerges on the balconey and right beside him is Bob waving to the crowd.
When Bob returned a few minutes later to where he had left his boss, there were paramedics there surrounding his boss laying on the ground - he had had a heart attack. Bob rushes up and asks what happened.
His boss looks up at him and replies, 'I was doing ok when you came out on the balconey. But then the guy next to me asks 'Hey, who's that up on there on the balconey with Bob?""",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fovmx/one_day_at_work/

58,Nosleep - I think you'll thoroughly enjoy my past week.,1298182034,"I was going to post this to the usual reddit.com subreddit but figured you would all get more of a kick out of my past week.

I live in an 18 story apartment building in one of the top 5 largest cities in the U.S.  To be more specific I live on the 12th floor and I have a 24/7 security guard posted at the main entrance.  I should preface this by saying I have 4 locks on my door, 2 dead bolts and a regular door handle lock that I always lock behind me, and a sliding hinge lock. 

My roommate went home a little over 2 weeks ago to study for state boards but came back for a day 1 week ago to pick up some stuff.  My past week has been the usual go to class, go shopping for food, study all day and night in my apartment - etc.  Come to find out yesterday, my past week was actually extraordinarily unusual and bizarre by all accounts.

I am sure I am over exaggerating some things now that I have realized their causes but to the best of my ability I'll keep everything the way it was.  This past week little things have been off, but when you live alone you always blame yourself for forgetting you closed to shower curtain or for leaving the fridge door open.  As I said, throughout this past week things have been off.  Wednesday (laundry day) I came back from doing my laundry to find my shower curtain entirely in the tub (both layers, not just the plastic layer.  Normal enough for most, except my outside shower curtain is heavy and long and requires being lifted up 1 foot to be placed into the shower.  Add to that it was wet - something I would have obviously noticed if it had fallen in the shower while I was in it.

Additionally, I found the fridge cracked open twice, and my orange juice half empty - albeit I passed it off to my roommate chugging it while he was moving his stuff.  My roommate and I have a tendency to always keep our doors closed because being 12 floors up the wind blows in through the air conditioners and creates a whistling wind tunnel in our apartment.  I always pass up noises in his room as being due to the wind.

By late in the week things were getting weirder. I found hall light on when I came back from classes, I found my computer shut (I never shut it as I am lazy and hate typing in my password when it locks) and probably some other things I am forgetting.  Well yesterday we had a wind storm and the wind was blowing HARD.  My roommates room was obnoxiously loud, more than normal and I was sick of it.  I was going to cover up his air conditioner. I grabbed some plastic bags and some duct tape - probably wouldn't do anything but worth a try - and opened my roommates door. I stopped dead.

Two feet were sticking out from under the bed.  They moved. I ran like fuck downstairs. I'm a short guy so I won't even attempt to persuade I have balls. I ran like a little girl down 12 floors to the security guard. Long story short, a homeless man found his way into my apartment while my roommate was moving his stuff last week.  Somewhere within the couple of hours during broad daylight the man made it in past the security guard, and randomly found my door unlocked.  Thus for one week, as I slept, a homeless man slept next door.  I don't expect to sleep again tonight.",nosleep,lastnightsmistake,/r/nosleep/comments/fovh5/nosleep_i_think_youll_thoroughly_enjoy_my_past/

61,Shapeshifting Reaper Bride,1298178521,"This is a story I heard from an Imam (Muslim priest), and it happened in the Southeast-Asian country Bangladesh. This is my first post on reddit and I'm not the best storyteller/writer so I apologize if the story isn't that dramatic/suspenseful lol. I believe this story is 100% real though, I'm pretty sure the priest wouldn't make up a story, it didn't happen to him personally but to one of his close friends who also is a religious figure. And also, I've witnessed someone being possessed and exorcised in person so I do believe in some of this stuff and don't doubt it. Also, in countries like that where it's very rural and just overall dark and stuff in most places, they do have a lot of supernatural and ghost activity going on.

So anyway the story is basically there's 2 brothers, and one of them recently got married. The marriage was an to another girl in their village, she was new and she didn't have any family there either, but she was the most beautiful one in the village and he married her. So one day the 2 brothers and the wife they're out by the lake and garden/forest type area. They are all by the lakeside and the husband goes into the garden to get something and is gone for a few minutes. Meanwhile back at the lakeside, the wife starts tearing up her clothes and getting it dirty, as if she just got into a catfight or some type of struggle. The brother meanwhile is watching this and is confused as to why she's doing this and goes up to her to see what's wrong.

As this is happening, the husband starts coming back to the group, and he sees his wife's clothes looking torn and dirtied, he asks her what happened and she blames his brother, saying that he tried to take advantage of her while he was gone, hence why she did that to her clothes to make it seem like the brother was trying to force her into doing something and was in a struggle. So after hearing this the husband is furious at his brother, but the brother is pleading that she's lying, but he's in a fit of rage and is sticking by his wife. At this point he's literally ready to kill his brother, so he grabs a hatchet or some type of sharp weapon they had with them since they were out in the garden, and he's ready to go at his brother for touching his wife like that, the brother also grabs his own weapon to defend himself and his trying to get the husband to calm down and explain, but the husband has lost it and he's set on murdering his brother, so they end up killing each other in the fight and both are basically very wounded and pretty much dead.

Now all this is being witnessed from not too far away by the priest's friend I mentioned. So now after both brothers are laying there dying, the wife casually just starts walking away into the garden as if nothing had just happened; she wasn't reacting during the fight either and just stood off to the side, not screaming out to her husband or even trying to get them to stop. As the woman walks away into the garden, the friend is very curious and he has just witnessed all this and now sees the woman just walk away as if nothing had happened, he's baffled at how she can just do that and what she's up to, so he begins to follow her into the garden.

He slowly follows the woman through the garden and then he couldn't believe what he just saw. As the woman was walking, her body was mostly covered behind a few bushes/plants for a few seconds, and then when her whole body reappeared again, she had transformed into another being. She transformed into this old/wise looking man, picture maybe like Gandalf, but just a bit toned down on the dramatic look I guess, but basically an old, wise looking man, full white beard, long robe, religious looking, etc.

Now the friend who's witnessing all this just can't believe it, and he actually calls out to the once woman, now old man and walks up to him to confront him. He says look, I just witnessed everything back there and you were a woman, I saw everything, you made them kill each other and you walk away as if nothing happened, and now you transform into this, you have to explain what's going on. This is one brave guy to confront him after seeing all that lol, but he's religious so I guess he doesn't have a fear of supernatural stuff like that. So anyway, after he asks the old man this, the old man says that it was their time to go, and that he's an angel and it was just their fate. And then he starts to walk off and for a moment disappears behind a few trees, but then didn't come out the other side of the trees, and had just vanished into thin air.


So that's the story, creeped me out when I heard it. Also, in countries like this arranged marriages are the norm so this all happened in a matter of a few days, I'm just specifying this so that you don't wonder how he didn't know his wife wasn't human if he married her, basically they just married and not like he got to know her personally as much before the wedding. But yeah the wife/old man was basically an angel or something, doing it's job like the grim reaper, guess it was bad fate for those 2 brothers to die like that.",nosleep,solidsnakem9,/r/nosleep/comments/foura/shapeshifting_reaper_bride/
62,Dreams in Sequence,1298175288,"I've had two dreams lately.

In the first dream, I was leaving my dorm building, headed into the parking lot.  It was raining, and so cloudy that it was almost like night time.  There is an area of the parking lot off to the side, with no spaces. Its so that garbage trucks can get to the dumpsters.  There was a dull green van parked there.  Not knowing who was in the van or why, I walked up to it.  I opened the unlocked driver's seat door, and saw a man that I can't identify. I shot him. I closed the door, and for some reason, shot out his back window before heading back to the dorm. 

A few nights later, I dreamed that I was in my dorm room, watching a foggy parking lot from my window.  This was particularly odd, since my room window is the exact opposite side of the building from the parking lot.  I saw police cars and bystanders (students, I guess) swarm to a dull green van. I walked away from the window.

While not overtly scary, I had this awful feeling after waking up from the second dream, almost nauseated.  Maybe it was what I had eaten the night before, or maybe it was that I had two connected dreams involving me killing a complete stranger. As far as i can remember, I've never had a dream that picked up right where the other one left off.  I'm a little nervous about what may happen next.",nosleep,Olgenheimer,/r/nosleep/comments/fou12/dreams_in_sequence/
63,Till the lights burn out,1298174253,"Harold didn't condone suicide, although the thought of it kept him company on many cold and desolate evenings. He thought of it from the moment he got up in the morning, through his daily scourges for food and supplies, as he unbolted and untwisted every lock on every entrance of his house and as he sat for the night with a firearm resting on the table beside him. The thought carried him into slumber, and the thought stayed with him beyond that. And every day he awoke with disappointment.

He cursed the day his impulses got the better of him. He cursed the way he defended himself as it closed in. He cursed how his hand instintively shot to his belt, drew out the gun, aimed it at the beast's head, and fired through seven clicks of an empty chamber. After that day he took out the rest of his stash and plugged it into the trees on his front lawn. In the past he would've been concerned about the noise, but that was back when people were around to hear it.

So he sat now in his aging rocking chair, blanket draped over his knees, soothing himself to sleep like he always did. The sun was just now descending beneath the hills. Soon they will come. Once the lights burn out.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fotsw/till_the_lights_burn_out/
64,Chronicles of a Pizza Guy I,1298174234,"Hi, this is my first time posting on reddit so please excuse any poor english on my part (not because it isn't my first language, but because I'm an idiot.) As you may have been able to tell by the title I work as a delivery driver, although recently I picked up some other skills and now work part time in illustration and graphical design. 

However I still love my full time job of delivering pizzas both because the money is decent and I just love driving. However when you're on the road so much, often late at night and in places you don't know....some weird crap can happen. This is the first of those stories I plan on telling. Just so you know before you get into it, this is 100% true and unexaggerated, just stories of what happened so don't expect any 'oh no I hear tapping on the window' *end of post*.

So about a year ago, maybe a bit more I just remember it was one of the winter months, I'm closing at the pizza place. Now at the time I worked in a relatively small town, I mean theres stuff going on there to the point that its not one of those 'theres a post office and a gas station and a 4 way intersection' kind of towns, but definitely not a city, just in general a very rural kind of place. So I leave on this delivery to lets just say Tally Rd, which is one of the more rural roads.

I do my general grab the food and whatnot and head for my car and hit the road. Now this is one of the furthest points we deliver to and is extremely rural. Now an important thing to note about this road which I didn't know at the time, is about halfway down it inexplicably the damn addresses change sides. On most roads you can look at any point and you'll see '322' on one side and '323' on the other side, and for the entirety of that road odds are gonna be on one side and evens on the other. Not on Tally Rd though. So I get to where its gonna be and theres 2 driveways one going left down to darkness as far as I can see, and the one on the right where theres immediately a large cinderblock building that kind of looks like a car garage. Now both the mailboxes are on the same side of the road so I'm like 'well I'm supposed to be going to an odd so it'll be on the right.

So I drive up this really crappy dirt driveway to get to the 'front' of the garage. Now immediately this place is striking me as a bit weird, theres old torn up curtains in all the windows of the place, only made weirder by the bars on all the windows and instead of using electric lights the place is obviously candlelit. At this point, not to sound racist, I'm starting to think the situation is basically mexican squatters are living here. In the area I live in alot of illegals are employed by either poultry plants or by orchards and its not uncommon at all to find them living in various abandoned structures. So a bit unnerved by the place I get out of my car but leave the pizza in the car in case I have the wrong place because I can see a lane going even further up a hill and into darkness and think maybe thats where I'm supposed to be headed and I don't want to bring the food to the door if this isn't where I'm supposed to be.

So I get out of my car and basically its exactly like a small garage might be, theres a giant baydoor covering practically the entire left half of the building, then a few feet next to it is just a regular door, and then about 15 feet to right of that is a big square window with candlelight and torn up red/pink curtains. Now I'm parked closest to the window because basically the way the driveway area is, that was the most ideal spot for me to park and then just kind of do a reverse turn, kick it in drive and go back to the store. 

So I hop out of my car and go up to the door and knock. At this point I can see multiple curtains shifting around and can just sort of make out humanoid shapes and just FEEL like I'm being looked at. Now I wait just about 10 seconds and start walking to my car, at this point very unnerved by the whole situation, although just kind of explaining it in my head like 'its illegals, they don't want to get caught so they aren't going to answer, I'm probably just at the wrong place, I'll get back on the road and try to call their phone number. Right as I walk by the window and am getting ready to get back in my car I see it. Now I say it, but I got the definite feeling it was a she just by body build and hair length. Now the candles had it lit up pretty well and what I saw terrified me beyond belief, the point that I was rooted to the spot. It had really incredibly pale skin with messy black hair. All over were cuts and sores, but what got me the worst were the eyes, just full black and completely unemotionless. What was probably just a second felt like hours, despite it being a cold night and me just being in a t-shirt I just started sweating profusely. I don't know how long I would've stayed like that if I wouldn't of heard a creaking to my left and saw the doorknob of the door turning. As it began to open I saw a gaunt hand with knifelike nails gripping the doorknob of the other side, the following all happened incredibly fast. 

I turned and saw the figure still at the window, only now it was grinning at me, large sharp perfectly white teeth, only sharp like fangs. I don't know if it was just my imagination or not, but the first glance at it, it seemed emotionless, not like it wanted to do me harm but more like it was observing me, and it just HAPPENED to look scary as fuck. Now I definitely got the feeling that it wanted to hurt me, it felt like it was looking at me like I was a meal. The last thing I saw of it was it running its tongue along its teeth and black blood spilling out into its mouth. I half dove-half fell into my car, shaking uncontrollably I turned it on, kicked it into reverse and got into the point where I could change to drive and get the fuck out of there. My headlights were now fully illuminating both the creature in the window and the one that had opened the door. The one that had opened the door looked nothing like the first one, being much bigger with very rugged earthy looking skin. It was very tall and very barrel chested with long arms and legs and a short neck with a long face. The creature in the window was screaming at this point a horrible screech even through the glass of the window and the glass of my car I felt chills and the tall creature in the door looked like it was laughing. At this point I didn't hesitate, I switched on my high beams to try and blind them a little and drove the fuck away as quick as I could. Once I got back to where Tally Rd meets civilization I calmed down a bit and I pulled out my cell phone to call the number I had for the delivery. 

A man picks up the phone, one of those guys you can just tell is one of them 'good ol boys' and basically he explains to me why I went on the wrong driveway and tells me to take the one across the road. Now at this point I'm still shaking profusely, still sweating, still have the images of those things burned in my mind, and I don't know if I even can go back because I know I'll be not 30 feet from the place. However I decide losing my job from being a coward just isn't an option and I go back, especially hauling ass right as I have to make the turn down the right drive-way. Now thank god as I get down this driveway, it turns into an extremely well lit garage operation, I don't know if I could've handled some dark driveway to a big ass rural house. 

The run at that point went smoothly, got a good tip even though it was a bit late, and got back to the store completely unkilled by monsters from the house across the road. So I'm telling the manager, the only other person in the store with me at this point all about it and shes alerting me that I'm out of my fucking mind. After a while of working and cleaning and taking runs we get a phone call, I pick it up and the voice is like a raspy woman. Now this is neither scary or unusual at this point, I get raspy people on the phone all the time for some reason or another. However the woman on the phone seems to have no idea AT ALL what she wants and just keeps asking me what I recommend until we have some semblance of an order. At this point I ask her address and shes says 'XXXX Tally Rd' which was the wrong house that I'd gone to. At this point I go white as a sheet as I hear a raspy laugh and a deeper rumbling laugh from further away on the phone. I just hang up the phone and my manager is like 'so whats the deal did they order?' I was just like 'no they changed their mind...' and then added their phone number and address to our 'bad deliveries' list on the computer and felt like I had just made the world a slightly safer place for the other drivers that worked there. 

Ever since then though, I've never felt the same sense of peace and calm I used to when I'd work in rural areas at night. Me, my girlfriend, and 3 of my friends all went to see Let Me In when it came out and afterwards everyone was joking about how they were always going to check their backseat before getting into their car from then on. What I didn't bother to say is that I'd been doing it for months, that before that point whenever anyone asked me if I carried a weapon on deliveries I'd be like 'nah, I cant imagine I'd ever need it, and if I did it'd probably just cause me trouble when I could just drive away' and after that point I started keeping my handgun in my car. How sometimes I'll be on deliveries and in my peripheral vision I swear I'll see her and it'll either nearly cause an accident or I'll have to find a spot to stop so I can calm myself down so I'm not emotionally compromised on the road.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fotso/chronicles_of_a_pizza_guy_i/

66,So I used to give ghost tours in Austin...,1298170270,"I have a few stories from my time there; a couple worth telling. Here's one of my favorites…

One night I'm giving a private tour to an Austin photo club. It's basically a normal tour with a lot more pictures being taken.

We walk around the [Bremond Block](http://www.pbase.com/roachimages/the_bremond_block) where I have a few stories, and gather on the porch of the North-Evans House (today the Austin Women's Club). I tell the story of a teenage girl who died and supposedly inhabits the house to this day—honestly, it wasn't my favorite story of the night, I didn't really buy into it. I stood with my back to the side door, told the story, and we moved on.

The next morning, one of the group emailed me one of his pictures.

You can see all of us standing on the porch of course, but just barely visible in the door, [you can see someone standing there](http://imgur.com/a/eog0R).

Scroll down for an enhanced view.

I can personally vouch that no one stepped behind me and stood in the door, and that the building seemed completely empty. That doorway is also deeply inset, so there's no way for light to reflect off of something inside.

From that day on, I always stood with that door to my *side* when I told the story of the North-Evans girl.",nosleep,happywaffle,/r/nosleep/comments/fosx6/so_i_used_to_give_ghost_tours_in_austin/
67,The Neighbor ,1298167003,"There wasn't a night that summer that we didn’t wonder what the hell was going on in Apartment 4H.

The block hummed in those sticky Queens nights. Old latino vendors sang as they pushed their icee carts. Mr.Softee trucks would jingle till late. The corners buzzed with the laughter of weed dealers, the tack and smack of men and women slapping dominoes onto wooden tables, with little girls and boys running and playing and reveling in another school-free night. Summer was summer, even in the ghetto.

I spent most of my time in my building’s courtyard with my friends Jonathan and Herman, talking, playing with hand-me down super soakers and baseball gloves, ogling pretty faced girls who came from other buildings, who seemed to hold some unknowable magic. It was our first real taste of the outside world after dark. I savored the feel of wet warm bricks beneath my fingers as we sat against the fence and wondered and hoped and dreamed. But as the evenings neared the end, as the night air stilled, our eyes would always creep to the blacked out windows of the apartment above mine, apartment 4H.
 
He moved in a few months before. I saw him only once, a young man wearing a heavy black hood on a damp spring day, standing in the middle of the courtyard and scanning the surrounding windows as if savoring the hidden secrets waiting behind. I was all curiosity, watching behind the security of a rusted gate that barred my room from the fire escape. When his pale blue eyes found mine, I saw within them a hollow thing, an emptiness that seethed against the gentle features of his baby face and flushed round cheeks. He smiled at me and I looked away and when I dared another glance I found him still smiling at me. Then he took slow steps into the building and I never saw him. 

No one ever saw him. 

His presence was at first a curiosity. People from around the way talked about how he never seemed to leave his place. Maybe he was afraid of all the darkies? they joked. During the day his windows were closed and covered with white blinds. At night the blinds were gone but the windows were still closed, lightless like empty eye sockets staring at you. Neither my parents nor I ever heard him walk across his floor, flush a toilet, open his door, or come down the stairs. I’d strain at night to hear him make any noise, but never heard a thing. 
As summer came, Jonathan, Herman, and I would stare at those windows and exchange theories and rumor and were always left more confused than we were before. 

“Maybe he left?” Herman said. “Like he just needs the place for his stuff.”

“My dad said the day he came, he didn’t bring anything with him,” Jonathan replied. 

“The fuck?”

“I know.”

“Does Albert’s dad know anything?” Jonathan said.

“He told my pop that he pays his rent every month,” I replied.

“He’s not freaked out?”

“He’s getting paid, he doesn’t care.”

“Word.”

One night we crept up the grey metallic stairs past my door and stopped before 4H. We held our breaths and listened and heard silence and the buzzing of fluorescent light. Thirty minutes passed. We turned to go, but then Herman grabbed my arm. A single sliver of pale light peeked beneath the door. Jonathan crashed down the steps. Herman hesitated for a moment, looking wide eyed, before he followed, giving my arm a feeble pull. I stood. I can’t tell you why. Whatever panic made them run was also within me. But the light held me, that pale glow that seemed so natural in every other door but so lifeless and strange coming from 4H. 

My scream turned into a strangled gasp. The light changed from the color of dying flesh and hollowed eyes to redness like a mist of blood. I took a step back and slipped and twisted my ankle and hobbled down after my friends. 

After that night 4H was no longer silent.

I gave him 15 minutes of my time to read his tale and got one of the best scares I've had in a while.

I applaud the man.

70,My Ouija Board experiences ,1298165200,"My 2 friends and I used to mess around with a Ouija Board all the time from 2002-2004 (in high school). We all swore to each other that we were'nt messing with it or pushing the oracle. We are all still friends and all have a deep trust with eachother. All of the events happened at my mothers house and at my grandmothers house (where I lived)


we would always light white candles and followed some rules we read about (never ask how they died, never taunt the spirit) but we were pretty naive about the whole thing.

The first time using it, I was the only one facing the lettering (one friend was across from me, the other was on the side) so it would be almost impossible for them to move the oracle as fast as it was going...


The first spirit was named Zak, and he was going from letter to letter very fast, sometimes it was hard to read what he was saying because it was so fast. 
Apparently (if I can remember correctly) he died in a motorcycle crash in NH (we didnt ask this, he just told us) and had a pregnant girlfriend. He was 18. He wouldnt tell us his last name or what year he died. 

He spoke to us often, he even said if we are talking to an evil spirit he would intervene and circle around the letter A to warn us. This happened several times. One of the time I remember most was when a spirit kept spelling words incorrectly and kept spelling out ""die or death"" then the oracle would immediately go to the letter A and circle around it.


One time it was just me and 1 of my friends using the board in my grandmothers basement. This is one of the strangest situations I have ever lived through. Her father died a few months before, and she was interested in talking to him. The spirit we contacted kept pointing to 1-9-5-3 which was the year her father was born. (I didnt know this) she started to cry, then the oracle moved off of the board and stopped under the table (which wasnt too far from the board on the floor) when we pushed the candle near the spot, we found her necklace that she lost the night before during a sleepover at my house. She was very stressed about it because her father gave it to her when she was little, but I kept reassuring her we would find it because the house was so small...and sure enough we did.


One time my friends and I were using it with my mothers boyfriend in the room. His father had died 20 years prior. He didnt have his hands on the oracle, he only wanted to watch. Soon enough the board spelled out ""hi son"". It also spelled out other things that I forgot but it led us to believe that it was His father. He asked the spirit to prove it was his father, so it spelled out ""S L O O P J O H N B"" my friends and I, being 15 at the time and having NO idea what that was, were shocked to see him start to cry. We had no idea it was a beach boys song that was his father and mothers favorite song. 

and one final story (although I have many many more) that I love to think about is one day we wanted to try to speak to as many spirits as we could in one sitting. We spoke to a bunch, a little boy, a grandmother, but one that I loved the most was a middle aged man who simply stated ""go sox""  (I live in Boston)


Eventually I moved to another town, and the Ouija board got lost, my friends and I are still close but we grew out of using the board.

72,Short story about my apartment.,1298161125,"Roughly four years ago, my SO at the time and I got an apartment in Southeastern Ohio. We were there for four months without incident. We broke up, it was decided that I would stay in the apartment because I was the only one working and the only one that could afford it. After my SO moved out, I lived in the apartment for one to two months until I found roommates. During these two months I experienced a couple different ""strange"" things happening to me. First things to note:

*I am not one to claim that I believe in the supernatural. I only claim to be unable to explain some things.

*I'm a social creature and in most cases want/need to be surrounded by people to be comfortable. I never just sit at home alone for days at a time, in most cases.. I'm with a friend/s or they're hanging out at my place.

*I'm not a writer by any means, please pardon my awful grammar, sentence run ons and stuff lol.

I was working at a larger electronic retailer at the time and was getting off pretty late (probably 10:30-11ish). I was driving home and to get to my apartments, there was a slight hill that you had to drive up to get to the apartment buildings. This was during the summer mind you and the roads were completely dry.

 Getting to the top of the hill my tires started spinning like I was stuck on ice or the snow. My car started turning to the left and eventually I started spinning out on the top of the hill and slid all the way to the bottom of it. Deeply confused about what just happened, I readjusted myself, checked to make sure nobody saw me brutally mess up on this hill and made my way.

 The importance of this part of the story is that after this moment I had a strange feeling. The only way I can describe the feeling is that I had plunged into a story of fear and horror, like I was living in a scary movie. I remember seeing the moon was shining very brightly in the clear sky over the apartment buildings and how it seemed like every light was off in every single building. I remember thinking how creepy the complex looked in the pitch black. I made my way to the back of my apartment building (where I parked).

 Walking into my building, I looked to my left where my neighboring building was and noticed one of the apartment's lights were on and the blinds were pulled up. Inside of the window, a camera on a tripod was pointing towards one of the walls that I could not see. Upon seeing this (which I've never seen before in the months that I lived at the apartment) I immediately thought of snuff/rape films and what could have possibly have been going on in that bedroom. The bedroom was also strangely red.. like they had a lamp with a red lamp shade over it.. I walked up the steps of my building and put my key into the door to get into my apartment. 

When opening the door to my apartment, on the left you walk into a small kitchen that opens up into the dining room/living room (combined). It was a very small kitchen and on the opposite end (where it opens up into the livingroom/dining room) there are two really large windows (they covered the entire wall of that room) that had the type of blinds that you can pull open. You can twist them open or you can drag the stick to the right or left to open or close them (I don't know the actual name of them). To the right of the entrance door lead to a hallway that branched off into a closet, the bedroom and the bathroom.

 I entered into the apartment and my routine was such: walk into kitchen, unequip keys, work ID, wallet, loose change and whatever else were in my pockets and walk in through the kitchen, wrap around the dining room and into the living room where I would proceed to take my shoes off, etc. The moment I turn left and my vision is looking down that kitchen, lined up with the first window, I feel like something is wrong.

 The first split second: something is wrong. The second split second: What is it? I don't see anything wrong yet, I just know that there is something wrong with what I am seeing. Third split second: The drapes on my window are parted open, as if somebody was standing in the dining room and looking out the window, parting the blinds. The forth split second: The blinds swing shut, rocking back and forth, obviously caused by physical movement. The fifth second was realization that what I saw doesn't make sense, but it's what I saw. During that whole fifth second, my thought process was such: The blinds were moving, which can be caused by air flow. But the blinds were *parted*.. clearly *parted*, just as they would look if somebody were standing there looking out. The only thing missing was an actual person, or thing. 

During that fifth second, I realized that what I saw was real and that there was no explanation for it. I backed out of my apartment quickly (not slowly, it was like a dive backwards) closed the door, (didn't lock it) and ran down my steps. I didn't stop to check if the camera was still in the window, I didn't check anything. I jumped in my car and drove straight to my parents house. I stayed there that night and told them that my air conditioner wasn't working for some reason and that I had to stay there. 

The next few weeks I spent staying at random friends houses, my parents house or if I did stay at my apartment, I had somebody with me. I continued like this until I found a roommate to share the apartment with and I forgot all about it until then. After realizing that this subreddit exists, I created a user name just to come on here and submit a story.

74,Footsteps. (true story),1298152421,"As i have said in my previous post, things like this happened often to me until i was given professional help about 2 years ago. 

I was sleeping in my bed, when i groggily woke up in the middle of the night. Sometimes you just do that, then fall back asleep. As i was trying to fall back asleep, i start to hear thumps on my ceiling. I immediately wake myself up and sit up because i figure i must be dreaming. I'm sitting up in bed fully alert and i'm listening to these thuds on the ceiling. They sound like foot steps, very distinct footsteps. Like someone is walking having their heal hit the foor then their toes. Heal, toe, heal, toe. It slowly makes its way towards my bathroom that is connected to my room. I get up and turn my bathroom lights on, I am fully awake and very aware of the foots steps. They seem to be walking around above me. 

I quickly seek out my father, wake him up, and bring him into my room. I tell him to listen because i can still hear the footsteps walking across my ceiling. This has to be real, i'm not dreaming. There is probably someone in the attic, they broke in and are just doing something up there, i don't know. 

My dad just looks at me kind of funny and says he will go up there and look. He doesn't bring anything with him to defend himself, but i didn't think much of it because i was too caught up in the situation. He comes back down and tells me that there is no one there and tells me to go back to sleep. I still hear the feet walking across my ceiling, but i figure if he didn't find anyone then it must be something else. 

For a while i continued to hear the footsteps on my ceiling late at night, from 1-3 am if i was awake. It eventually stopped and i forgot about it. A few months ago i was just talking to my Dad and i brought up this incident. He told me that he never heard anything when i was telling him to listen. He just went into the attic to try and get me to go back to sleep. 

I was the only one who could hear the footsteps. ",nosleep,sashimi_taco,/r/nosleep/comments/fooir/footsteps_true_story/

76,My experiences (first post),1298147026,"I was just browsing /r/nosleep and decided to contribute my own experiences.

First off, a little bit about me.  I'm 18, and in college. Before I moved to my dorm I had lived in the same house my whole life.  All of my experiences except one have taken place in that house, which is about 60 years old and in a small Wisconsin town.  No one in my family believes that any of these experiences actually happened.

- When I was about seven or eight, I was in my newly finished basement with my best friend at the time.  We had most of the lights off and had one of those plastic button lights while we danced around to some popular 90's music.  Eventually we got tired and sat down and talked for a bit.  All of a sudden, my friend screams and points at a wall.  I didn't see anything, but apparently she saw something move.  We tried to re-create it from where we were sitting to see if it was either of us who did it, but there was no way we could have from where we were sitting, so we ran upstairs.

- When I was about ten, my family and I were getting ready to go shopping or something and in order to leave the house, we had to go past the stairs for the basement (we don't have a door on it.)  I glanced down the steps, and standing there at the bottom, was a woman wearing white.  It was the middle of the day, and the rest of the basement was pitch black, even though there are lots of windows.  I hurried out the door and looked back downstairs and there wasn't anyone there, but the room was still black.

- Nothing happened again until I was sixteen.  I was laying in bed, and had woken up really early.  I rolled over to look at the time, only to come face to face with a white ferret-like creature with black eyes.  The odd part was that I could see it clearly, even though I'm legally blind without glasses or contacts.  I stared at it a moment and it didn't move, so I batted at it with my hand under the covers.  It kind of leaned left and disappeared.  I closed my eyes tightly and opened them again to find that the thing had reappeared, only this time it was snarling at me.  I didn't know what else to do so I turned my lamp on and it was gone.  I have a really tall bed (too tall for my seven pound dog to jump up on), so this thing either had to be floating or really huge.

- That summer, I went out to my uncles farm to ride my horse.  We were walking along a trail through his woods when all of a sudden I heard indians singing.  My horse stopped and stared off into the distance before turning around and calmly walking back to the farm, without my direction.  There haven't been indians on his property for thousands of years.

- Last year, I had a bout of sleep paralysis.  It was the scariest moment of my life.  It started with some very low growling above my head, which was way too low to be my dog, and besides, it came from inside the wall.  I snapped my eyes open to see someones arm coming out of my door and lots of swirling colors.   It was over in a few seconds but it still scared the living daylights out of me.

- I also see things out of the corners of my eyes all the time, especially in the living room which my bedroom leads into.  My dog will often sit on the end of my bed as far as he can go and bark madly into it, even though theres nothing there.  My ex boyfriend has told me that he has seen things walk into my room sometimes when he sits in the living room.  There's also a part of my basement where I always feel like I'm being watched from.

That's all that I can remember happening to me.  I know the ferret incident wasn't sleep paralysis because I could move the whole time.",nosleep,breannabalaam,/r/nosleep/comments/fon6h/my_experiences_first_post/
77,Why I refuse to go anywhere near a Ouija board. Or crows.,1298146022,"This happened a few years ago, I still get chills whenever I think about it.

 My friends and I had decided we needed to hold a seance (because all the cool kids were doing it). My mother had a ouija board, as she was very spiritual herself. I never saw or heard of her using it though, and I never questioned it. It was generally decided to hold it at my house since my room had enough space to fit us all at the same time, and it would be easier to get the ouija board. It was but my mother had put it in her closet on the highest shelf, way in the back. My parents were out for a bit so it wasn't really that hard to go and get it. We started at exactly midnight. My room was all seance'd up, or at least what we thought a seance would look like. Candles everywhere we could fit them, with thin red scarves over my lights, and we were all dressed in black dresses. We at least had a lot of fun putting a bunch of makeup on eachother beforehand lol.

We started by chanting. ""Spirits, join us. We call out to all who can hear, please join us."" We all moved to put our fingers on the pointer on the ouija board. I felt the room getting noticeably colder. I lived in the basement, in a room with no windows. Obviously it was already a bit cold from the fact that we were underground, and still it got colder. The tension was palpable. The only thing keeping us chanting was the fact that we had already started. After about a minute we stopped, and asked the question: ""Is there a spirit here?""

No movement.

We asked again, ""Is there a spirit here?""

Still nothing.

We started to asked again, and the pointer moved. It spelled out Y-E-S. 

We then asked aloud, ""What is your name?"" The pointer started moving slowly again. It spelled the words out... S-A-L-P-H-A-S. 

We didn't know really where to go from here. Someone decided to ask... ""Show yourself."" And then we felt a rushing of wind(like I said, no windows...) And the room got warmer and we got no further responses. After about 5 minutes of nothing and we decided to stop and clean up. I put the ouija board under my bed.

The slumber party went pretty normal from there. We ate too much, talked too much, and fell asleep watching a movie. 

The next morning, everyone walked home and I did my homework. It was a pretty normal day. But when I walked the dogs that evening, I felt like I was being followed. I saw quite a few crows outside. Being fall, it actually wasn't all that unusual, I guess, but I never really noticed them before. The dogs were weirdly less energetic and they stuck very close to me. We got back to the house and we had all got settled in for the night. 

I went to sleep and was having nightmares, which is very unusual for me. 

I woke up and went to school. I felt followed even inside the building. I asked my other friends who had been there that night and they all looked like nothing was bothering them and they said nothing weird was happening. I was getting very paranoid. As I walked home again I noticed even more crows outside. I felt like someone was right behind me but there was nothing but a few crows on the road down the street.

I was feeling scared by the time I got home. I played with the dogs to calm myself down a bit. I had dinner with my parents after doing my homework and I went to my room and watched a movie. I must have fell asleep because the next thing I knew I was in a dream and just upstairs on the couch. You know how you just know when you're in a dream? Well, yeah. Here's a picture of the living room/kitchen: http://imgur.com/g0n0o  Just forget about the creepy hallway, it's just always been creepy to me that's it. But what I saw when I was sitting on the couch filled me with dread. I saw in the sliding glass window a man. A tall, skinny man wearing a suit. He had white hair but he looked young. And there were crows flying all around him, behind him. They filled the street, it was like an ocean of them. But it wasn't the crows that had freaked me out, it was the smile on this mans face. He was smiling, but it wasn't a smile. It was pure fucking evil. He looked at me like he was going to come inside the house and kill me and everyone in it. I couldn't move. At all. He reached for the door handle... and vanished. I then had the urge to look behind me, but I still couldn't move... Somehow I managed to. And I saw him in the bay window, still smiling. He walked slowly over to the door next to the bay window. Like he was going slowly just to torture me. And then I woke up in a cold sweat and panting. The blankets were all wrapped around me. I knew I had to get upstairs and see if he was there. I don't know what pulled me up there. That man... After running up there I saw my father sitting in a chair by the sliding glass door. He just looked at me.

""You saw him?""

I about collapsed. All I could do was nod. And my father said, ""Don't worry. He is not coming back."" I told him about the ouija board and the seance me and my friends had a few days ago and he went and got it from under my bed and told me that he would take care of it. 

I don't know how he did it... I haven't seen the man since then. But I basically shut down if I hear someone talking about a ouija board and I hate crows.",nosleep,littlebitofevrything,/r/nosleep/comments/fomy7/why_i_refuse_to_go_anywhere_near_a_ouija_board_or/
78,Ghost Hunters coming to my house tonight,1298144831,"So a while ago I said that I was taking a ghost hunting class with my mom, and tonight is the night that the team finally comes over to my house. They're brining EMF readers, cameras with infrared light sources and a PX device (this one is really creepy). I plan on taking around my own video camera to film stuff; we'll be investigating a weird crawl space in my brother's room, a really big and strangely shaped walk in closet (more like a room) and some of our barns outside. If anything interesting shows up I'll make sure to post it as soon as I can. If the team finds something it will take a few weeks for us to figure it out. 

Time to bust out the proton packs, boys and girls. 


Edit: Will post video (if it's interesting) and summary at [The Unintentional Drowning of 53 Choir Boys](http://unintentionaldrowningof53choirboys.blogspot.com/) probably by Midnight

Edit 2: Okay, it's over now. Sorry for the confusion, but a show didn't come to my house (I stupidly didn't realize there was a show called ""Ghost Hunters""). I'm pretty skeptical about ghosts and I don't think anything that happened here really swayed me much. However, there are some pretty creepy recordings we got and I haven't looked through any of the pictures. I'll post a short video of the house and maybe some of the recordings but it will take a while to sift through it all and we'll see if I find anything different.

She's wondering if you have any idea what could have happened during this experience, to this day it still scares her and we can't figure out actually happened.  She maintains it wasn't from the fever or medication she was taking at that time, and that she was NOT sleepwalking.  Any ideas? 

""I had been sick in bed for a couple days with some sort of virus.  After three days of fever, aches and lots of ibuprofen, i was starting to feel better.  In the early morning, I hear my teenage daughter (OP) talking to someone.  I got up and went to the bathroom and could hear her.  I looked at the clock.  It was three in the morning.  I went to her room and asked her who she was speaking to.  ""What?"" she asked.  It was clear she was asleep.  I said never mind and went back to my bathroom.  At that moment I was aware of hundreds of voices talking in the air around me.  It was almost like white noise, but they were there.  Hundreds of voices, all talking at the same time.  Then there was one voice above the others, shouting at me, to me, trying to get my attention.  It was a female voice, that I am sure of.  It was desperately trying to get me attention, to communicate with me.  At that moment, I said aloud ""Oh My God, it IS real.""  I was terrified.  My husband was out of town, I didn't want to scare my daughter.  I didn't know what was happening.  The only thing I did know was I did not want to hear from this person.  Not knowing what else to do, I curled up in a fetal position i bed and hoped it would go away.  It did.  I often wonder what exactly did happen, what this girl wanted.

88,Dreams,1298129523,"I have been having some really weird dreams lately, I was wondering if No Sleep could help me with this...they are starting to really freak me out
First, last night. I had a dream that I was in my room and trying to turn on the light. No matter what I did, whether I pulled the cord or flipped the switch, they wouldn't turn on. In my dream, I was really worried that something was coming and I needed to see to defend myself. Luckily, my cat sat on my face and woke me up via suffication.
Second, I have been having dreams that I am stuck to my bed. I can see everything in my room, but I can't move. We just were talking about REM sleep, where we can't move our bodies, in psych, so I think that that's accounted for. But still, it was terrifying. I wasn't able to move and I kept looking at my door and window, waiting for something to come.
Lastly, this is a reoccuring dream. I had it when I was little too. I'm at this indoor waterpark with my family. We're all having fun, and I follow one of my little sisters up to the top of the biggest slide. She goes down with shierks of joy and calls for me to follow her. I go on the slide and about halfway down, everyone in the park dissapears. Then the lights go out. When I get to the bottom, and run to the door and pull on it, but its locked. I had this dream from when I was 8 years old to when I was 10 years old. Then I stopped having it for years. Its back. ",nosleep,alwayssmileback,/r/nosleep/comments/foiss/dreams/

91,"Maybe someone could explain this dream I used to have when I was very, very young.",1298127343,"Hey guys, just wanted to get some of your opinions about my dream. It's probably one of the earliest dreams I've ever had. I wish I knew exactly how old I was when I first had this dream. It's one of the very few that's stuck with me my entire life. Probably the only one I still remember so vividly. Probably not creepy at all but I thought I'd share. @_@

I'm not a very good storyteller, so please bear with me.

Alright, here we go. The dream starts off in complete and utter darkness. I see nothing but I know I'm surrounded by a great multitude. It feels like I'm at the very center of a very big coliseum and it's packed full of things I can't see. Bear in mind that I'm not feeling any fear or apprehension, just that I know I'm in another place. If anything, it feels like I'm in the middle of Nowhere.

As some indiscriminate time passes, I start hearing voices all around me. As I try to listen in, I realize I can't focus in on anything they're saying. I can't understand one word. All I know is that they're talking or communicating, whatever they are. It's like I'm underwater and I'm hearing muffled voices from somewhere far away. More time passes and I get the sudden realization that they've noticed me trying to listen in. After noticing me, the voices start building up around me and in no time flat it becomes one huge deafening cacophony. At this point I feel like I'm spinning. Like the whole world is going to spin off its axis and plunge me somewhere dark and deep.

And then I wake up. 

**TL;DR**- I was very, very young (I want to say I was 7 or 8... but it escapes me just how old I was) when this happened so I've always struggled as to what it meant. All I could feel was that I was being observed. And that, at some point, I guess whatever was out there noticed I was trying to observe them back. That's when the voices started to get louder and louder until it forced me essentially to wake up.

92,"Thank you, nosleepers",1298125400,"I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for making my first endeavor such a success. I really did not expect such a response. The rankings, the comments, the private messages... it was an amazing ride. One I had not intended to stay on for quite so long, but I couldn't ignore the constant barrage from people to continue. Every time I said ""That's enough"" I felt bad, like I was leaving people hanging. It was like a monster that I had spawned and kept feeling obliged to feed. Honestly, I had no intention of writing the second day's events, let alone the third's. I wasn't even sure where I would go, so I tried to clear multiple possible paths that I could take... the downstairs neighbor, the basement, the chimney.

In retrospect, I think some of what helped with the writing was that so many of the elements in the story are true. We do live in a duplex, my wife and daughter and I (along with my other, 10-month old daughter). The attic, the basement, the layout of the rooms and backyard are all true. My fear of the basement and looking out the back door are also true. It's REALLY spooky here at night. My wife is really a teacher and a heavy sleeper. My daughter's room is really a mess.

One of the earliest responses asked about inspiration. When I was young, I had a bunch of little books. Tales For the Midnight Hour, More Tales For the Midnight Hour, STILL More Tales..., etc. One of the stories was about a woman who buys a puzzle and goes home to do it in the middle of her living room at night. As she's putting the puzzle together, she realizes that its an image of the room she's in, complete with her sitting there, horror-stricken. In the window behind her in the picture, a ghastly face is staring at her. I visualize that ghastly face pressed against the glass every time I walk up from the basement. That was to be my story, except the shock value was too cheap, I thought. I was blowing my load early, you might say. So I worked it out that night to make it a more methodical, creeping kind of terror. One bit of imagery I used was from The Ring... a brief shot on a videotape of the ghost girl standing there, staring at the camera.

I'm writing this in a separate post to try to retain some of mood of the original story for newcomers. I almost want to go in and delete the last two day's worth of my posts though. I don't like the ""endings"" I tacked on. Do yourselves a favor, when you're writing, end things on your own terms. You will always feel like you've lessened the experience by doing more than you intended.

Oh, I apologize to anyone who took the story to heart, who truly feared for me, my daughter, my family. I am humbled by your offers to help, your concerns and your worries. The authenticity of my story is in no way indicative of the spirit world itself. Keep on believing. Anyone who was honestly scared by the story believes, even if it's just a little bit.

98,My experiences living in a haunted house.,1298106907,"I have been in to the paranormal/unexplained; UFOs and aliens; and all the other fun stuff for as long as I can remember. I once lived in a haunted house, in a haunted neighbourhood when I was in my early teens. In brief, here are the things that I experienced:

- My whole family being rudely awaken in an early weekend morning as a result of the radio in the room shared by me and my brother turning on, on its own, full blast, all while the switch being in the off position. Naturally, my Dad came storming in, asking if we were crazy, saw that we were both hiding under our covers, while he some how (i guess pulled the plug) made the madness stop.

- Once again, in the early morning, around the same age as above, was sleeping on my side when I suddenly woke up to ""someone"" poking my back. I was thinking that I might have been in the semi awake stage, so I just waited for it to quickly stop. The poking however persisted and even became hurtful, as there was more force being used. I wanted to believe it was my sister playing a trick on me (knew it wasn't my bro, he was sleeping happily and unpoked in the bed beside me) When it did finally just stop, I finally let out a breath/sigh of relief (I was so scared I was holding my breath as long as i could) I slowly turned over, hoping to dear God I was not going to come face to face with a SOMETHING or a someone I didn't know. Saw no one, heard nothing. Got out of my bed, looked in to my sister’s room, she in deep sleep like my bro.

- Same time of day, on a different day, around same age, I woke up to my bed landing back on the floor. Don't know how high it went, just knew it wasn't on the ground for God knows how long. With my heart racing, and doing a quick survey of my room, I got out of bed, and began to inspect it. I was not thinking immediately that my bed was in the air, but rather that it had broken some where. I checked all the legs, stood at the end and checked to see if it was still balanced- all was just fine. I then just thought to myself that perhaps I just dreamed it and went back to sleep. At breakfast my Mom then asked out of the blue, ""Hey, what did you guys make fall in the morning, I heard a big bang?""

-Again, same as above time/setting, I experienced the most terrifying paranormal experience I’ve ever had. I was suddenly awaken to find my arms out to each side (right arm was fully extended, left arm was more bent, and down wards) while my upper torso was slowly being lifted off the bed. The higher I was getting, the harder I was trying to scream for my Mom. It got to the point that my upper torso was completely off the bed, and I just did not want to take any more of it, nor see what was going to happen next. I tried with all my might, and finally was able to scream out for my mom. As soon as I let it out, It-they-or whatever just let go, and I just fell back on to the bed.
That I recall, the landing just slightly hurt, I was more so dazed from it. I did not even
think it was a paranormal occurrence, I just assumed I wasn’t in control of my body due to me being so tired or from waking up to quick from a deep sleep. It wasn’t until many years later, that one day I just remembered the incident, and thought to myself: wait, its not possible to lift urself up backwards with out the use of arms, and even if I did use my arms, I would have not gone at such a height and angle anyway.

-I also remember continuously having this dream where I approach the top of the stairwell and I just find myself able to fly down the stairs, and all around. When I awake, I recall the dream as I approach the stairwell, and how wonderful it felt to fly. I however knew it was JUST A DREAM, and did not bother trying to see if I could actually fly down. There reason why I am stating this is because I sometimes wonder if it was the spirits that induced the dream, and were trying to see if I was actually dumb enough to try and fly by jumping off the top of the stairwell and fall to my death, only to join them in their realm.

Well, just as I had learned how it usually goes in a haunted house, my parents fighting got so bad that they divorced. It has been a struggle ever since, but I must say I’m just used to it by now. Anyway, happy to have shared my paranormal experience to you all, I look forward to becoming more of an active member. Peace out.

99,My experiences with the supernatural. (more in comments),1298104790,"Hey guys, first time I've posted here but I have a few experiences that I figured you might have some interest in.  Sorry it's so long, but one story on its own takes up a big chunk of it, so the rest of the story is in the comments.  BUT **TL;DR:  Possession, haunting, ESP, ghost sightings, weird trans-human sightings**

A little background about me, I'm 23, born and raised in Minnesota, lived in Jersey briefly before I came back home.  College educated with a degree in psychology and another in theater, pretty secular and consider myself skeptical of a lot of ""supernatural"" things.  However, I have had a few things happen in my life which have weirded me out.

Growing up, my maternal grandparents owned a farm in a somewhat rural suburb in Minnesota, called Maple Grove.  It used to be a farming town but over the last 15 years has gone the way of urban creep, and their farm was one of the original ones in the area.  It was built in 1897 and they updated it over the years, but most of the house was still the original work or expansions that they had added on.

Most of my creepy stories I can tell you about come from that house or happened there.

I'll start out with a minor one from when I lived in Jersey; I saw something that I can't really explain.  I used to sit on the roof and smoke while I'd look out at the lights from NYC since I was a midwestern kid and Minneapolis has shit compared to the Big Apple as far as lights and sights.  One night, I saw a mid-sized dog, maybe a small yellow lab going down the street at a decent pace, I'd call it a trot.  I whistled at it since I fucking love dogs, and then froze when I saw it stop in its tracks, look in my direction for a second, get up on its hind legs like a human and run down the street faster than most sprinters.  It went to the end of the block and turned the corner.  I wasn't doing drugs at that time, but that one flipped me the fuck out and made me want to.  Still, not all that creepy compared to some other stuff I've seen.

Back to my grandparents' house.  

My grandfather passed away from cancer in April 2009, really threw me for a loop, but I was prepared for it and had moved in with my grandma and grandpa to help out at the property while he was undergoing treatment.  This happened in the Winter of 2008, but I don't exactly know how to explain what happened other than what I talked to my grandmother about afterwards, since my grandpa forbade anyone from talking about anything supernatural and would get angry as all hell if anyone did.  

One night when we were eating dinner, I heard banging coming from the sewing room and figured one of the cats had knocked over a mannequin or something.  I started to get up, but my grandpa who was a pretty soft spoken man told me to ""sit [my] ass back down and finish dinner"" in a tone that made it clear that it wasn't up for discussion.  I told him I just wanted to get the cat out of there before he made a mess and he told me to not worry about it and to not go upstairs.  The banging went on for about 5 minutes before it stopped, and I have no rational explanation for what it was, because I found the cat curled up behind a closed door on the main floor and there was no mess in the sewing room.  There is a not-so-rational explanation that I can offer but I'll do it after my next story.

Second creepiest moment I have ever had was when I was younger and home alone at their house and I saw an apparition in the sun room, or what used to be the main sitting room.  I was on my way to bed, and in the house there are two landings on the steps.  The first is one step up and leads to the wall where there's a mirror facing the sun room.  When I took that first step I looked in the mirror and in the darkness saw a woman dressed in white, dark hair that was tucked up into a hat, sitting in the rocking chair.  She wasn't moving and had her back to me but I sat there for a good second or two before I swung around.  No one was there, but the rocking chair was moving.  I ran upstairs and sat in their bedroom which is in one of the newer expansions to the house.  I think I figured out who she, and whatever is in the sewing room. were though, and that part had me even more creeped out.

Some of this is from historical documents I've gathered and some things I've put together myself from talking to people who know the history of the place.  In the late 1920's, the people who owned the farm rented out a bedroom to make ends meet during the Depression.  The renter who had come from Kentucky and came to Minnesota as a hired hand took his quarters in what we now use as the sewing room, and in the late 1920's (I think 27 or so) he took his own life by hanging when he found out his daughter had died from some illness.  I think that he's still around there.

As for the woman, I'm pretty sure I know who or what she was too.  The people who had the property at that time seemed to kind of be bound up in tragedy.  When the renter killed himself, the family started having financial troubles (even more than most) since they lost a bit of income but more importantly someone who could help around the farm.  By the mid-30's the husband had turned to alcohol and became abusive.  I found an obituary in a church archive that listed both of them having died on the same day in 1936 with practically no details.  When I started digging around more, it turned out that the husband had gotten abusive enough that he threw his wife down the stairs and killed her.  When he realized what he had done, he went down to the old cellar and hung himself.  I have some stories about that little corner of hell that existed before they moved the house (literally lifted it off of its foundations) but I was young and knew enough to stay the hell out of there whenever I could.

Now here's the big one.  This is something that I've only ever told 5 non-involved people about.  One was my psychiatrist, and the other four are good friends.  This happened last winter, so from the fact that I've only told that many people, you can gather that I don't really talk about it and it still freaks me out.

So I have this friend, we'll call her Ann.  Ann has always been unique.  Very perceptive, very feeling, very empathetic.  She could tell you things that you hadn't told anyone ever and would know all about it.  I thought she was just perceptive, but she has since told me it's more than just that.

Typing this out, I realize I sound crazy, but bear with me.  Ann called me one night, asked if I wanted to hang out, told me she felt like we should spend time together.  I told her to come by, and again I was home alone as my grandmother had gone to Arizona to escape the cold.  We sat up and ate home-made pizza, and yes, each had a few drinks.  Neither of us were even close to drunk as we had maybe 4 drinks over the span of as many hours and I was pouring them.  

We were watching TV when Ann asked me to shut off the TV and that she needed to talk to me.  She wouldn't look at me, but kept her eyes locked on the corner of the room.  She told me she could see things and people.  Things and people she shouldn't be able to see.  Things like where someone was born, their history, their secrets, like watching scenes out of a movie.  She told me she could see people she had never met, people she couldn't have met, and she could talk to them.

Like I said, I was a psych student, and I was worried that maybe she had been going through some schizophrenic episodes but then she hit me with the kicker and I'll never forget her words.

""I can see your grandfather.  At least I think he's your grandfather.  Skin, worn and leathery from years in the sun.  His hair is so white, it used to be grey and peppered but it changed... it keeps changing.  He's wearing glasses.  Strong hands.  Very strong hands.  He has happy eyes, and god his laugh.  He laughs with his whole body, so happy.  He's a jokester.  He likes jokes.  He doesn't talk a lot but he's always smiling, always happy.  What a kidder.""

I stared at her and my jaw dropped.  I thought maybe I had talked to her about him, but then realized I hadn't.  I thought maybe she had seen pictures, but my grandma didn't have any pictures of him in the kitchen or the room where we were watching TV.  I told her to stop fucking with me.  It had pissed me off a lot.  I was close to my grandpa and her joking about this sort of stuff did not sit well with me.

She looked at me and it seemed like she wasn't even talking to me, more like she was talking to me over the phone.  She told me ""he had eleven.... no... twelve?  eleven or twelve brothers and sisters.""

He did, he had twelve brothers and sisters, one had died in infancy.

She told me ""he grew up in a white house, very small, lots of people, but always happy... hard living... I see the letter G and a lot of corn, lots and lots of corn, but the letter G is still there.""

He grew up in a white 2 bedroom farmhouse in Graettinger, Iowa where his family grew corn and raised cattle.  They still own the property.  During the worst of the Great Depression the entire family lived in that house.  30 odd people on the property, all packed into a 2 bedroom farmhouse.  That's what he grew up in.

0,Fly flee fly away,1298099960,"About ten years ago, I was dating a girl whom I'll call Mara (for what it's worth, she's now my wife, sleeping right next to me (I'm typing this on my phone, so please forgive any mistakes or funky autocorrections) while I further my inability to sleep). Mara lived alone in the top story of a divided off house which was about 110 years old at the time of the story. The surrounding area was fairly nice - a quaint, upscale neighborhood nestled in the middle of a major metropolitan area. Though I felt she was always safe there, she had a really hard time sleeping alone - she never turned lights off at night and slept with a utility knife under her pillow and frying pan by her side. She heard noises (raccoons, etc.) constantly and could never quite convince herself that she was totally safe. 

She had lived there for about two years when she left my apartment one night to go home. I got a distressed call from her about fifteen minutes later - she was sobbing and obviously shaken. After several attempts, I finally came to understand that she arrived home to find her front door standing wide open, and she dared not venture in. She mentioned that she had possibly forgotten to latch it earlier, so it could have been innocently nudged by anything into opening - I was certain that this was the case, and I decided to go check it out for her so that she would be able to sleep. 

Thinking that I should probably introduce some levity to this taxing situation for her, I grabbed a decorative machete from my room (she brought it back for me from Argentina as a souvenir on a trip she had taken a couple years prior) to use ostensibly as a self defense weapon. I got out of my car handling my machete with feigned machismo, which had the intended effect of making her laugh and calm down. I told her to wait in her car while I checked through the house, so that even if something were amiss, she'd be safe. 

I made my way to the front door and ascended the stairs, wielding my machete a touch more seriously. Though I was confident that there was nobody inside, I couldn't help but be naturally a little creeped out. As a compromise between these things, I kept my back to walls and turned on every possible light, checking behind every door and looking in every closet. The main clearing process took but a minute, since the place was fairly small, so I doubled back through and more thoroughly checked more obscure places - under the bed, behind the couch, in the shower.

Having secured the apartment, I remembered that there was an annex room to her living area that housed the stairs to the attic. I was a bit wary of going up there, as it was a little creepy, even in the daylight. However, it was my chivalrous duty to be thorough, so I reluctantly pushed myself through the final door and looked up the dark stairs. 

""Anybody hiding up here?"" I ironically asked as I chuckled. The light switch wasn't until about halfway up the stairs, so I knelt to grab a flashlight sitting at the base. 

For a few seconds I was answered with only silence. Then, the sharp intake of breath a mere few feet above me. Shit. 

""fLy, flee, FLY awAy!"" the voice hissed, clearly and articulately. Oh god, I can still hear it now and it chills me to the bone. 

""WHAT THE FUCK"" I screamed as I inadvertently dropped my unlit flashlight and fell on my ass. I began wildly swinging my machete in front of my face in a feeble attempt at protection from whatever bastardly entity had made that unholy noise.

I backed out into the relative safety of the lit hallway and found another flashlight nearby (I think Mara must have been a bit scared of the dark) and shone it up the stairs. Nothing. 

""Alright you fucker, this isn't funny,"" I nervously said as I ascended enough stairs to reach the light, ""I have a machete and I will fuck your shit up."" I didn't even believe myself; I'm confident that it was far from threatening. 

In a gathering of courage, I bounded up the stairs to meet whoever was up there. Flashlight shining in every nook and cranny, machete clutched with white knuckles at my side. 

Nothing. Absofuckinglutely nothing. I checked again and again, but with the same results. Was I losing my mind? Had I hallucinated the voice? It couldn't be - it was far too real. But where had the person gone? What the hell was going on in my brain?

I decided to try to suppress my newfound misgivings as I walked down to the porch and waved Mara up. I told her that I had looked everywhere twice and hadn't seen a thing out of place (didn't even have to lie!), and that she was safe and sound. Though I tried to hide my nervousness, she clearly saw that something was up. I thought for sure that she knew me well enough to intuit that something alarming had happened. 

""Aww, you got a little nervous looking around in the dark and taking care of me, didn't you? Maybe I can take care of you a little bit.""

Mara unzipped my pants and licked my ear, taking my cock in her hand. She turned off the light as she got down on her knees and slid her mouth over my dick. I was so worked up over the voice that I came within a couple of minutes - she swallowed it down, giggled at the speed and thanked me for assuring her safety. I hadn't taken my eyes off of the attic door the whole time, and was still creeped out as I left her place. 

The whole drive home, I couldn't get that damned voice out of my head. I turned all the lights on in my apartment and slept with my now-beloved machete by my side. In fact, I still have it by my bedside to this day, even though we've moved a few times - it's an old friend that endured a harrowing experience with me, and I'm not about to let it go. 

Sorry this doesn't have a terribly creepy ending - I don't know if I'll get frowned on for closing with some sex instead, but hopefully it's not too bad of a faux pas.

2,Sound of marbles,1298092079,"So i've heard this from multiple people who believe their houses/apartments are haunted.  They say that late at night they sometimes hear a sound from above them that sounds like marbles dropping all over the floor.  I always just sort of brushed this off, but in my new apartment I've recently experienced this phenomenon a few times.  Its really bizarre, because I can't imagine what else could be making that noise - it's the distinct sound of marbles dropping to the floor and rolling around.  There is never another sound after it occurs, which is strange because you would expect to hear your upstairs neighbor picking up whatever he dropped - if this were the case.  Has anyone else heard these kind of noises?  What else could be causing them? ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/focfc/sound_of_marbles/
3,Strange Mtn Man.,1298091908,"I'm sorry but this isn't much of a story but maybe someone can through some insight on this. 
When I was a child 7 or 8, I would have reoccurring nightmares of me falling off a cliff and waking before I hit the ground. I know most of us had something like that one time or another but twice where I woke up before the cliff. Like something from outside of my conscious persuaded me to wake up. Noted this feeling before the cliff occurred on Christmas Eve. I wish I ignored the feeling, the first one was me waking with my back toward the door, as I roll over to look at my door for some unknown reason, I see this 6'7"" silhouette of a mtn man in my doorway. My doorway is barely that height so he filled the entire entrance up. Let me say this, no one in my family is over 6'2"". I roll back over shaking so hard I almost screamed myself to sleep.
The second occurrence was a little more intimate. Same feelings with me waking up to the same mtn man's face in my bunk-bed's mattress. That face will forever haunt me. The distinct hair follicles of the beard and beat up skin from numerous bite. I never looked into the eyes which probably saved my insanity (er what's left of it).I soon then traded rooms with my brother but never the less the damage has been done.

4,The Shack Behind the Church.,1298091472,"Believe it or not, this IS a real story. It happened about two years ago, and I'm still freaked out about it today.
Okay, my church youth group was having a lock-in. We did this often and were pretty good about following the rules, never leaving the building etc, because the neighborhood my church is built in is not the best neighborhood and our leaders were normally very strict about us leaving, even more that time because a murder had recently happened in the apartments next to us. 
Well, our church is decently sized. The grounds are bigger than the building though. We slept in the sunday school building that was creepy because it was so old and there were all these legends and blah, blah, blah. The scariest room was the nursery at night. A light from the playground that was just the right mixture of blueish-white that you see in horror movies shone in through the huge windows onto the abandonned cribs. There were also two fields in the back that the neighborhood sometimes used and that we used for our easter egg hunts. But the creepiest thing on church property was the shack. It was this little abaddoned house on the side of the road. There was a fence (about knee-high) that was around it, and for my knowledge, the door had always been locked.
So, this particular lock-in, we decided to break the rules and go investigate the shack. I want to say, for the record, that this was not my idea. By some miracle, our youth leader let us go. We followed Andy (the guy who suggested the shack for shits and giggles) down through the parking lot to the place where the shack was nestled. He and Kyle, another boy who was all for the shack, jumped over the fence and walked up to the door. The girls and a quiet boy named Cameron stood behind the fence and watched them pull on the door. It was not locked. However, it was bungy-corded shut. Kyle, being the hick he was, had a pocket knife and cut the bungy-cords. They dissapeared into the house.
We stood out there for about 2 minutes until Cameron, who had been staring intently at the sole window on the shack, raised his hand and pointed at the window, ""Look."" We looked, and I wish I hadn't. Staring out from the window was a face. More specifically, a bald man staring right at us. We all debated running, in fact one girl did take off running, but we realized that Andy and Kyle were still in the shack. We screamed for them to get the hell out of there. They came out looking confused, but we just yelled for them to run. 
Right before we reached the corner, we heard Cameron once again telling us to look. We turned around and saw the man standing just outside the house staring directly at us. We ran and locked the door. We didn't unlock the door until 10:00 the next morning. I haven't gotten closer than 100 feet to the shack since.",nosleep,alwayssmileback,/r/nosleep/comments/foca4/the_shack_behind_the_church/

6,A Shadow (first post),1298088633,"I don't really know what to think about this, let me know what you think.

Firstly, My bed rests right in front of my closet because it just barely fits in the part of my room that it is in, there is probably about a foot and half gap between the foot of my bed and the wall. My closet is basically at the foot of my bed and I cannot close the door, so I just leave it open all the time.

A while back, maybe a month or two, I was fast asleep in bed when I woke up feeling like someone was in the room with me. I looked at my closet door and I remember seeing a black foggy shape creeping out and a feeling on my ankle like a hand was there. Not literally a hand on my ankle, but a sort of pressure there that one would assume a hand to feel like. I remember being a little scared, but mostly curious but still scared enough to ask it to stop, which was surprisingly very hard to do. I know that when you sleep, your brain temporarily paralyzes your body, for safety, but I was wide awake and trying to say 'Stop!' seemed like it was the hardest task in the world and the fog just kept getting closer. I eventually was able to speak 'Stop!' loudly. It sounded like, ""sssssssssssstOP!"" and when I said that, I felt release, like I could move again and I literally witnessed this fog recede back into my closet.

Needless to say, i was frightened the whole rest of the night, but a part of me, even now writing this, wants it to happen again. Not for an, omg guess what happened to me last night guys!! lololol, but to see where it was going to take me. My curiosity is very great and I just want to see where this fog would take me.

13,I am the Midnight,1298074842,"(This post is based on a couple of requests made in this comment thread http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fo2lt/not_a_ghost_story_but/c1hd9jz)

As a child, I was a skinny, short nerd who was incredibly shy and horrifically bullied. I'm not talking your everyday, run of the mill bullied by a couple of kids and your day went on. I'm talking about a systemic nightmare that the entire school was involved in from kindergarten through senior year of high school. This was literally hell in a brick building, the sort of bullying that drove other kids to shoot their peers. It's rather scarring to not know what was wrong with you, to not know what drove everyone else you knew to reject, ostracize and torture you. Of course you thought it was your fault when everyone was involved. Details aside, it was the kind of stuff that made lesser kids commit suicide.

But no. I wasn't going to be sucked into that path and dominated. I was not going to be told what to do. I was weak, but there was someone stronger. Someone more powerful. Someone that was the end result of all the hell that the nerd had been put through. The anger, the sorrow, the pain, the horror, the rage...all of the emotions a child should never have to feel at that age, it became something new. A person that was everything I was not.

He introduced himself as the deepest of all darknesses, the blackest nightmare known. He was retaliation where I was terrified of authority. He was anger where I was depression. He was suave where I stuttered. He was attracted to the supernatural when I was afraid of the dark. He was night, cold and dark. He called himself the Midnight. 12 AM. The very incarnation of the nadir of the night.

Midnight became my alter ago. A place where all the anguish and hatred I felt seemed right. An answer to the crying prayers that went unanswered night after night for relief from life. A roar in the silence.

I was reborn. Strange things began happening around me as I reached out to it. Shadows moved in the darkness of my room at night, but I feared them not. I reveled in their cold, in their ghostly presence. I walked graveyards late at night, not for the thrill, but for the oneness with the night. I had nightmares, but woke up feeling refreshed. Nightmares where I died in awful ways. It didn't bother me. Everything everyone else was terrified of, I welcomed.

When Midnight was within me, the bullies seemed afraid of the intensity within my gaze. They didn't bother me as much. I stood tall, instead of slinking through the hallways. I spoke up instead of cowering in class. I was no longer afraid of excelling.

As I got older, Midnight's prominence began to recede, but I still found myself attracted to the shadow, to the night, to the darkness. I felt a kindred spirit with the occult, the dead and the damned. Midnight never harmed or held ill will to those around me, except the hatred of those who had done me wrong...but even that hatred remained quelled. When I entered haunted places, the activity became obvious.

As an adult, I was finally diagnosed. What was wrong all those years was revealed in stark reality. I was bipolar, and Midnight likely was the manifestation of part of the disorder, the manic, invincible me. The reason people hated me became clear as day. When I was stabilized, Midnight began to regress. I became more myself than I ever had before. Still, I will never forget...

14,Crazy Lady,1298074625,"First of all I want to point out that this story is completely true, (though few people I tell in real life believe it) and it is probably possible to find a newspaper article about it if you look hard enough.

When I was around 7 or 8, I would sleep on the couch in the living room during the weekend so that I could watch TV or play N64 as late as I wanted. My parents were very adamant about me not having a TV in my room and didn't like me using electronics during the school week, so these nights were pretty amazing to me. I had full control of the remote and could even watch some of the shows that I wasn't supposed to after my parents went to be. Being a little kid, I usually couldn't make it past 11 o'clock anyway so my parents didn't mind allowing me this small freedom.

One night, I had already fallen asleep with the TV on when I was awoken by noises coming from our front porch. My living room was located at the front of the house and had large bay windows that looked out over the front yard, but also made it possible to view the porch if you pressed yourself against the glass and looked at an angle. I was terrified, but was scared I would get in trouble for waking my parents up about nothing so I slowly crept towards the bay windows. I held my breath as I leaned against them and saw something that I can still see clearly in my mind to this day. It was a middle aged woman, probably in her late thirties, wearing dingy clothes, sitting on our front porch swing, just looking out into the yard, not moving. Her clothes were covered in blood and she kept swinging on our swing, holding a kitchen knife while I stood frozen for well over a minute. Finally my muscles unlocked and I sprinted into my mom's room to wake her up. 

Being terrified and 7 I forgot how to work a door knob so I ended up pounding on my parents door until they woke up. I was in hysterics trying to tell them what I saw but I wasn't making any sense and they assumed that I had been having a bad dream. I finally calmed down enough to explain what happened, and they told me that I had had a nightmare and that there was nothing to worry about. They told me to get into bed with them but I wouldn't stop crying and begging them to get out of bed. 

Finally my dad angrily got up to prove that I was just dreaming and roughly dragged dragged me to the front door. I tried to tell him not to open it, but he walked straight to the door, slung it open and said ""See? Noth-"" The look on his face changed from anger to pure terror in a split second as the woman turned from the front porch swing and stared directly at us. He slammed the door shut, locked the door (which had been unlocked the entire time) and told my mom to call the police, while he went and got his shotgun. He told me to stay in his room, but I could still hear him as he stuck the barrel of it out of the door and asked her what she was doing. I couldn't hear her and my parents refused to tell me for years what had happened, but apparently she just kept saying ""Someone killed my husband, but it wasn't me."" My dad told her he had called the cops and to stay where she was.

Eventually she just walked off of our porch and continued walking down the street. The cops found her a few minutes later wondering around another house in the neighborhood, but we had already called and warned everyone that we knew. 

To this day, I refuse to sleep on that couch.

17,Why isolated farmland has always scared the shit out of me,1298067921,"A childhood story that an old high school teacher told us on Halloween that always spooked me and has stayed in my mind.

My teacher (we'll call him Jim) grew up on an isolated farm in rural Iowa where they bred dogs and raised horses. One weekend, Jim's dad was away from the farm on business, so it was just Jim and his mother. One night while watching TV in the farmhouse, the dogs started going crazy outside. Jim's mother made him go outside to quiet them down.

Jim grabbed his flashlight and headed out to the line of kennels that sat at the edge of the farm against a treeline. The dogs were all restless and would not stop barking. While trying to calm them down, Jim suddenly smelled an overwhelming stench. It smelled like a wet dog rolled in trash and got sprayed by a skunk. A smell he'd never encountered during his life on the farm.

Then, from beyond the treeline, a terrible screeching filled the air, the sound of which sent the dogs into an even deeper frenzy and stopped Jim dead in his tracks. Jim ran inside and grabbed his .22 and told his mom there was something outside. They headed outside, where the screeching came again. 

Jim and his mother heard the horses out in the field whinnying with fear and begin galloping. ""Jim, get the horses!"" his mother yelled. Jim ran out to herd the horses into the barn, fearing that maybe a cougar had found it's way into the area. Getting to the edge of the field he saw their stud running through the darkness. Behind the horse he saw the silhouette of a figure, long and lanky, running on all fours, as tall as the horse and gaining ground on it. 

Terrified but not wanting their horse to be killed, Jim began running alongside, trying to get the horse toward the barn. As they ran, they came upon a series of three farm buildings that passed between Jim and the horse. As he ran, he could see the horse being chased by the beast in between each set of buildings. As he rounded the corner of the last building, he pulled up his gun and waited for the beast to come from behind the building.

The stud shot from behind the building and then.... nothing. No creature. Jim slowly edged around the building, sending the horse over to his mother who locked it in the barn. As he got further, he was able to see past the building. Standing there behind the building, he made out three sets of reddish eyes, all at least 8 feet high. Jim's mother had made it over by that point and saw what Jim did. ""Jim, let's get inside,"" she whispered to him, her eyes glued on the heads that seemed to float so high above the ground. They slowly backed away until they felt safe enough to make a run for it, then barricaded themselves in the house. The next morning, Jim investigated around the farm, but found nothing but a few strange tracks.

TL;DR: Teacher's farm was attacked by very tall, lanky creatures",nosleep,tpatch,/r/nosleep/comments/fo67b/why_isolated_farmland_has_always_scared_the_shit/

19,Not sure if this was on here before...but have you heard of the 'Red Room' from Japan?,1298061474,"Hi, this is my first time to r/nosleep. Thought I'd share a story about an urban myth in Japan referred to as the 'Red Room'. I apologize if this has already been posted. Nothing really escapes reddit.

In June of 2004, an 11-year-old schoolgirl murdered her 12-year-old classmate, Satomi Mitarai, in an empty classroom during the lunch hour at Okubo Elementary School in Sasebo. She left Mitarai's body at the murder scene and returned to her own classroom, her clothes covered in blood. The girls' teacher, who had noticed that both were missing, found the body and called the police.

After being taken into custody, she was reported as confessing to the crime, saying ""I am sorry, I am sorry"" to police. She spent the night at the police station, often crying at times, and refused to eat anything. She was offered snacks, but refused to eat them. Eventually, she ate bread and drank juice. However, she initially mentioned no motive. Shortly afterward, she confessed to police that she and Mitarai had fallen out as a result of messages left on the Internet. She claimed that Mitarai slandered her by commenting on her weight and calling her a ""goody-goody.""

This was named the 'Sasebo Slashing'. Later they found out that the 11 year old was a huge fan of an urban myth named 'Red Room'. The myth is as follows:
Two friends discuss a rumor about an Internet pop-up ad that asks ""Do you like —?"" (あなたは—好きですか？ Anata wa — suki desu ka??). If one dares to close the pop-up, he dies. The more skeptical friend does some investigation. At home, he looks it up on the web, but nothing happens, and he goes on to visit his own favorite sites. Suddenly, the message pops up. He tries to call his friend, but there is no answer. Again, the pop-up says with an unusually adorable voice: ""Do you like —?""
After he clicks to close it the first few times, it keeps re-appearing. It then starts automatically reloading. Then the voice gets mangled and then the friend notices the word 'red'. At first he gets confused when he reads 'Do you like red?'. Then the voice gets mangled as he keeps clicking off the pop-up until a new part of the message is revealed, finally displaying ""Do you like the red room?"" (あなたは赤い部屋が好きですか？ Anata wa akai heya ga suki desu ka??) with an even more adorable voice. Then a website with the names of all the people killed shows up, with his friend's name at the bottom. He feels that there is something behind him. Two mysterious hands in the dark grab the friend's arms as if to throw him on the floor.
The next day, some people in school talk about two boys from the next class who committed suicide, painting their rooms red with their own blood. Then, we see the protagonist's computer, still on the website with the names. The protagonist's name is now at the end of the list, after his friend's. It then shuts off, along with an eerie sound.
After the video ends, if the user's browser has not disabled pop-ups, a pop-up resembling the ad from the story will appear.

20,Dragging across the floor (true story). ,1298061421,"Things like this used to happen to me all the time, however about 2 years ago i was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and was given antipsychotics. Since then these occurrences have stopped, so i have to assume i either made it all up in my head, or because i stopped believing all of it was real they all left me alone. Either way, it was real to me and very terrifying. 

One such occurrence happened in a guest house in a country club in arizona. As soon as i entered the house i knew there was a ghost there, or at least something bad. I tried to tell myself that it wasn't real as usual but this one was pretty bad. 

I decided to go to bed, and my sister decided to stay up and watch tv. As i lay in my queen size bed i started to drift to sleep when i suddenly heard a dragging noise on the other side on the bed on the carpet floor. I just told myself it was my dog, then i realize my dog was not with us and i suddenly became wide awake. I was in complete darkness and i pinched myself to make sure i was awake. I could still hear the dragging sound, like something was being pulled across the carpet, something heavy. The sound came around to infront of the bed, and i couldn't see anything, but it was still moving. Moving towards my side of the bed. I began to scream for my sister as hard as i could, too afraid to even reach out and turn on the lights. My sister opened the door, looking quite annoyed. I told her what happened and she looked at me like i was retarded because I was always afraid of something. 

Then we went to bed together in her room and i felt safe. She put her gossip magazines on her bedside table and then put a glass of water next to them. When she turned the lights off, i just closed my eyes and did not move. Then we both heard her magazines fall to the ground. I thought, thats fine they probably were off balance. Then we both heard her glass of water make a ""ding"" sound, as if something tapped it. We both didn't move and eventually fell asleep. We shared our experiences in the morning and i was too afraid to be alone in the house for the rest of the trip. 

I know this is not the scariest story, but to me this was real. It may or may not be real. It is a dilemma i have to deal with ever since i started taking medication. Are my experiences real, or are they all in my head? I have to think at least some of this was real since my sister was witness to some of it as well.  I'll post more of my experiences if people are interested. ",nosleep,sashimi_taco,/r/nosleep/comments/fo3zs/dragging_across_the_floor_true_story/

22,"Not a ghost story, but...",1298057402,"I apologize for the length, but I feel that this is a rather interesting story, and it does keep ME from sleep....
This is something that happened to me years ago, and still haunts me every night...


I was very young, and I had found my ""first love."" For courtesy's sake, we will call him W. 
I hadn't yet learned what a dark, scary place the world is. Raised in a very sheltered Christian home, I was convinced that life was all butterflies and rainbows. W was older than me by 3 years; he was a dark, brooding soul who had suffered so much in his life. He was such a beautiful person, inside and out, but not beautiful like a sunny day or a baby's smile... It was a sad and terrible beauty that still holds power over me to this day.


W and I fell in love. I was so fascinated by him, and I also wanted to ""fix"" him; I wanted to make him forget all of the suffering in his past and make him happy. But he... he tortured me. Some days, he was so sweet and wonderful (""J, my favorite thing is to go outside late at night, climb on the roof of my house, and just stare at the sky. To me, there's nothing more beautiful than a clear night sky... Nothing except you."") and other days he would act like he didn't care about me at all, like he didn't even want to be talking to me. It hurt me, and I didn't realize it was anything more than his past troubling him until later on...
 (Now, before you say he didn't really care about me, that he just wanted to get into my pants, that isn't true. He was always so respectful toward me. He even asked my permission before hugging or kissing me. He did care, in his own way.)


One day, he revealed to me his membership in this... organization. I won't reveal their name here, because I am TERRIFIED of them. They had some sort of goal they were working toward, but I never really understood what it was, as he couldn't tell me a lot of things. They sent him on dangerous ""missions."" He came back weary, wounded, quiet. He called it a fellowship, but it seemed more like a cult to me. It worried me. A couple of weeks after he revealed the existence of the group to me, he told me that they weren't pleased with his involvement to me. According to them, he was too attached to me, was telling me too much, and because I was ""a liability to his mission and cause,"" he would have to ""buy"" from them the ""right"" to be with me. And he had to pay in blood. 


The next time I saw him, he showed me an enormous gash on his leg; it looked awful, painful, and I cried. I begged him to quit the organization, and he said they would beat him or worse if he tried that. I was dazed with the thought of such a scary group of people, and the fact that someone would be willing to pay them in blood to be with ME (I was lacking in self-confidence).


A couple of months later, he moved four states away. He told me that his organization had split into two groups, and one of the groups hated him. He was afraid they might be planning to harm me, or kidnap me and hold me hostage, in order to get to him. Okay, so now I was paranoid.


So he had decided to enlist members of the organization who were on his side to watch over me. Like, spying on me, telling him what I was doing, watching my house at night to make sure I was ""safe."" I thought this was creepy, but I was scared to death of the ones who were against W, so I let it be. I felt safer being watched, but I was still BEING WATCHED. Especially since these were people who claimed to be his brothers, but then made him bleed just so that he could be with me.


I didn't completely believe that they were truly watching me for a while. He even gave me the name of the primary ""watcher,"" I don't feel a need to censor this; his name was Phoenix (probably not even his real name). He told me via text message when I was eating dinner in a restaurant with my mother EXACTLY what I was wearing and the conversation my mother and I were having. Another day, I was out getting groceries, and he again told me what I was wearing.


The creepiest part was when I was four hours away from home, at a leadership conference (I was a ""good kid""), and some of the kids on the conference were going bowling. I was invited, and went along. W texted me and told me that Phoenix was there, and he told me the score every time I bowled. I was slightly uneasy that Phoenix would follow me four hours from home just to watch me for W. I begged W to tell me where Phoenix was, I wanted to see what my watcher looked like. He finally told me the door that Phoenix was outside, and I went and looked. There was no one there.  I was scared about the watching, but I loved him, so I dealt with it.


W himself also came back home a few times to visit me. My parents had never approved of him, so he came to my house late at night, I snuck outside, and we would sit down outside my bedroom window in the grass. We would look at the stars and talk about the future, and he held me. 
...W and I always had our share of problems. We broke up, got back together, tortured each other, broke up, got back together...


Late one night when we were having a particularly good few months together and he was being wonderful to me 100% of the time, we were talking on the phone. It was late at night and I was laying in my bed. I remember the moon was full that night.


He told me that he had come home a few times when we were at odds with each other, snuck up to my house at  night, and sat outside my window. I had been none the wiser. As if this weren't creepy enough, he began telling me about his demon.


He told me that he shared his body with a demon. Anytime he had been rude or uncaring to me in the past, it had been the demon speaking, and not him. He told me this demon had been there since he was a child and his dad had begun beating him (I knew about the beating already). I believe in demons. And I kind of did believe him, but I was still skeptical. I thought he was exaggerating, or something. He said, ""It got better for a while, but it's about to start getting worse. It's coming back. It hates you for helping me.""
I was speechless for a moment, trying to sort out my thoughts.


I rubbed my temples and closed my eyes. 


And when I closed my eyes, I saw the scariest thing that I have ever seen.
I saw a demon. It was in my head. First, I just saw a vaguely humanoid shape, it was undulating, oily and gas-like at the same time, and somehow black and red at the same time. It had its back to me. Then, so suddenly, it turned around. Its eyes were gleaming blood-red and its face was so malicious. Its teeth were sharp and dripping with something greenish. It snarled, and hissed at me, the scariest sound I've ever heard, ""Angel. Angel..."" It snarled again. 


I began praying to God to protect me. I opened my eyes, thinking it would go away, but I could still hear its rasping breaths. I closed my eyes again and its eyes were right there in front of me. ""Angel..."" I continued praying, I was crying. Its eyes narrowed and it turned on its heel and stalked away. 
W had been on the phone the whole time, and he heard me crying. He asked me what was going on, so I told him, and asked him what it meant by ""angel."" 
""It's talking about you, because you're trying to save me... Now that it knows you, I don't know if you ever can...""


W and I ended up breaking up. It was my choice. He was somewhat bitter about it, but he was honest. He told me that they would still be watching me, and that he would always love me. He told me he would do his best to defeat the demon, or at the very least, keep it from me...


I don't even live in the same town anymore; I've moved away to a university 3 hours away from home. I've made wonderful friends, joined a sorority, tried to get involved in things and my studies so I can forget... It isn't working. Every night, whether I am out somewhere or at home, alone or with my friends, I feel uneasy. I know that someone or something is always watching me, whether it is Phoenix or the demon, or even W himself.

24,"An evil ghost in King's Wharf, Bermuda",1298051713,"I was working on the crsuie ship ""Empress of the Seas"" (Royal Caribbean), and we were in King's Wharf, Bermuda. I went to sleep one night, and was woken up in the middle of the night suddenly. When I opened my eyes to find out what was going on, there was a tall, thin woman in a long dress standing at the doorway of my room staring right at me. When I say staring right at me...she was staring INTO me. I can see her very clearly...she has long dark hair, and piercing eyes.  I’ll never forget those eyes.

I'm actually getting goose bumps just thinking about it. She knew I was there, she was completely focused on me...and it wasn't a pleasant feeling.  Still today, years after the fact, just thinking about it makes me feel uncomfortable.

I rose up in my bed, and she backed off through the doorway...she melted through the door out into the hall. I freaked, and thought I must have been imagining it. I tried to get back to sleep, and eventually I was relaxed enough to do it...only to be woken up again that night by another noise.

This time, when I woke up, the same woman was back in my room...except she wasn't standing in the doorway, she was hovering in the corner of the room, up near the ceiling. She was crouched into a ball, and staring RIGHT INTO ME. It was probably the most terrifying feeling I had ever had in my life...and I jumped out of bed and lunged at her. She faded into the walls, and was gone.

I left the lights on for the rest of the night...I was so freaked out.

The next day, I wrote an email to some of my friends and family...and I didn't really go into any detail about the ghost, except to say that I had seen one.

My friend Erin wrote me back.

She had worked on the same ship a few years earlier, and she had some very interesting questions for me. She asked me if I was in King's Wharf, she asked me if the ghost was a white long haired woman with black straight hair, and she asked me if she seemed evil. I hadn't said anything about any of those points, and that freaked me out completely. I wrote her back and said that all of those things were true, and asked if she knew something I didn't.

Turns out that I wasn't the only person on the ship who’s seen her. I guess she'd been haunting other people, but only in King's Wharf...and if you know the history of King's Wharf, you'll know that some not-so-good things happened there.  I heard it was a pretty harsh prison and some pretty horrible things happened there.

I have no idea how many people have seen her, but it would be interesting to know.

I'm guessing that she was someone who was imprisoned, and/or tortured...and that she haunts ships that come into King's Wharf. But, it was a completely freaky experience that I'm not too excited to ever repeat.

26,The dream,1298041942,"   When I was five years old, I had a reoccurring dream that kept me awake for about two weeks. It scared me so much, it still as altered the way I sleep 20 years later.

   My five year old self is sitting in a huge hotel. I'm in the lobby, waiting for something. I'm all alone. No adults, no friends, nothing. No sounds either, as I never dream with sound. It's vintage, almost like it hasn't been touched since the forties. I sit in the dim light of the chandelier. A chill runs over me. I turn to see about a dozen disfigured and mutated people, running towards me. All like they just barely survived a terrible accident. I can only assume they are zombies, or ghosts. As they lunge towards me, I grab a key from the front desk and I run for my life. 

   Because of size and their condition, I mange to make it to an elevator before they can reach me. I head to the 50th floor, and to the room my key unlocks: 505. I lock the door, and run to the bed, thinking I'm safe. For a long time, nothing. I wait. I can slowly see the shadows move under the door. They can't get in. They try, but the solid oak door doesn't budge. I'm safe.

   In the basement, there is one more. He is missing his head. In his hand, he has a key with the number ""505"" on it. He stumbles up the stairs, trying his key on every door. Meanwhile, I fall asleep, assuming I am safe from them. 47...48...49. He slowly makes his way to my floor. His key meets my lock. All of them creep into the room. They fill the darkness. They reach towards me with their bloody hands.

I always woke up at this part, like clockwork. To this day, I cannot sleep with my back towards the door. When I do, I get a terrible sensation that they are there, reaching with their bloody hands...",nosleep,VicePresidente,/r/nosleep/comments/fnx48/the_dream/

29,Is this some kind of joke?,1298041542,"So yesterday I was just casually browsing Reddit as I normally do, a few weeks ago I subscribed to /r/nosleep so that I could karmawhore with stupid comments in the comment section.

Yesterday I was at work and I read the story about the man with the woman, or apparation, or whatever that seemed to be stalking him. He said that there was something that kept him from being able to confront it, from being able to really do anything other than quiver in fear, or run. 

I posted a comment on the link, urging him to do something completely ridiculous and bold, because I thought it was cute and funny or some shit, and obviously I didn't believe him.

What I'm telling you all now is the best, most honest advice that I can give, please listen:

BE CAREFUL OF THE COMMENTS YOU POST. THEY HATE ARROGANCE.

Arrogance, bravado, sarcasm, they hate that. They hate it when you don't take it seriously. When you don't take THEM seriously. I tried to seem cool, like a sarcastic badass who wasn't afraid of anything. I feel like a new person, after last night. I wish I could feel like I used to. 

I really took living normally for granted. My entire life, I could wake up in the middle of the night to get a glass of water in the dark, feed my cat, sit on the couch in the dark and watch TV. Never again.

Even as I sit here now in broad daylight in my office at my desk, typing this, shaking, I feel as if something is watching me. I am silently praying that this honest apology and story will make them forgive me for what I said, for what I did.

I went home after work yesterday. Everything was normal. I forgot all about that stupid story. I wasn't thinking about anything really. I was just getting into the bed. My cat was following me around the house, meowing a bit more than what I'm used to. I closed the door to my bedroom, because I honestly can't sleep with a cat crawling all over me. I wish I hadn't. There's something about animals that makes me feel safe. 

I should have known something wasn't right, as soon as I closed the door my cat kept pawing at the door, over and over, shaking the door. I saw him reach under the crack on the door with is little paw. I feel like the poor guy was trying to protect me. (His name is Aubie, after my favorite football team's mascot. I feel like I won't know him much longer. I hope my family takes care of him). 

He kept meowing as I was trying to go to sleep, ""Shut up Aubie!"" I grumbled at him. I reached over, and turned off the light on my bed side table, and that's when I noticed them.

I was surrounded. I froze there, my legs covered up by my blankets with my torso upright, with my arm reaching over towards the lamp. There were eyes, all around me in my dark room. My heart pounded. That was all I could hear. I could see the door moving, from my cat pawing on the door, but I couldn't hear it, all I could hear was the sound of my own heart as if it were in my ears. All I could see were a few pairs of glowing eyes, on the edge of my room in my plane of vision, but I knew they were all around me. I could sense one, behind me.

The room was pitch black, I need it that way to sleep, but the room seemed darker below the eyes as if they had some form of body or shape to them. I could feel air on the back of my neck, breathing. I couldn't move. I was too afraid to move. I wanted to just reach back and yank the covers over my head and pray for it to be morning. 

Bless him, Aubie some how managed to get the door open. I live in a town house build in the late 60s, and the doors are a bit off their frames. When the door swung open, I managed to get up enough courage to get the covers over my head. I couldn't sleep, though. I knew the images were still there. I expected my cat to jump on my bed, but he didn't. I don't know if he ran, or what happened to him. But I saw nothing, I heard nothign but my heart. I kept my eyes wide open with the blanket right over my head. 

It felt as if gusts of wind were pushing against the blanket periodically, but I had no fan, the air conditioner wasn't on, the heat wasn't on, I knew it was them touching me. Trying to get to me. The blanket I used on my bed is an old quilt my mother gave me, I felt as if it was keeping me safe.

30,The Fisherman.,1298039717,"My 4 year old son (at the time) was sleeping at his Grandma's house one night and started crying in the middle of his sleep, when Grandma went in to see him he kept asking "" Who's that man in the corner Grandma? Who's that man?

""Son? Did you see a man one night when you were sleeping at Grandma's?""

Son: Yes.

Me: What did he look like?

Son: He was a fisherman! (Smiling)

Me: Was he looking at you?

Son: No. He didn't have any eyes.

33,The scariest experience in my life (happened a while ago),1298032208,"So, I don't know, I think I've only told 1 person who wasn't there about this, because I think it sounds pretty... lame to retell.  This seems like a good place to put it though.  I don't think it's super exciting, but even though I've had three near death experiences (one before, with almost drowning, and two completely different ones since), I had not yet, nor have since, been as scared in my life.  I figure it's a decent introductory post

I was probably about 14, and my mom was driving us (herself, my sister, and me) up to our grandparents cottage for the weekend.  I remember it being late, around 1 or 2 in the morning.  When we were about 45 minutes away, I started to get a little bit nervous.  I wouldn't say afraid, but just nervous.  At the time, it felt like the kind of feeling I got before sectionals in swimming.  As time went on, it was slowly turning in to a sense of dread and fear.  I don't really know how to describe exactly how I felt besides saying that it was starting to affect me physically.  I didn't say anything, though, because I wouldn't have been able to say why.  There was nothing unusual about the trip and nothing that had gone on recently to make me feel that way.

When we were about 15 minutes away, I was breaking out in to a cold sweat.  We were listening to Limp Bizkit pretty loudly (I remember that very specifically [yeah, my mom actually really loved them]), and out of nowhere my sister just yelled that we had to turn the music off.  She started crying, and in between sobs she was telling us to turn back:  Something bad would happen if we kept going.  That's when I told them both that I had been really nervous for the past 30 minutes, breaking in to a cold sweat, and having trouble breathing.  She just told us not to worry and that we would be there soon.

I've had a lot of panic attacks and that kind of thing since then, and maybe because this was the first I can remember, it sticks out in my mind very strongly.  I just started crying too.  My mom was telling us that it was going to be fine and that there was no reason to worry,  We'd be there soon.  We just kept going along the country roads, and when we were about 5 minutes away, we passed up a cornfield and this crappy old run down house that has since  been torn down (it was always kind of a landmark for me; there is a turn at the street right after that).  As we were passing it, I remember that I was holding my sisters hand; both of us crying.  And it wasn't just that I was scared.  It felt like there was something there.  Something very menacing.  I could barely breathe and I was bawling my eyes out.  My mom was just steadily repeating a mantra of don't worry, it's going to be ok, and crap like that.  

Almost immediately after we turned off that road, we both stopped weeping.  It felt like a weight was lifted off my chest.  My mom just asked us if we were doing better, though it was obvious we were.  I was still a little afraid, just because of how scared I was only a few moments before.  

The strangest part was, my mom told us once we were in the house that she too had been afraid since about the same time that we started to, but that she didn't want to scare us further.  I don't know if she was trying to make us feel like we weren't crazy, but there's no reason for us to not believe her.  It would sort of explain why she was just telling us that it would be all right, when clearly we were scared shitless.  

EDIT:  Also, I just want to add, that because of some... shall we say, issues, I know that I cannot trust my own senses.  It's just the fact that someone else felt the same way without me saying anything or me giving any queues about how I was feeling.",nosleep,Embla,/r/nosleep/comments/fnung/the_scariest_experience_in_my_life_happened_a/
34,My first time on nosleep brought back some memories...,1298029526,"I'm terribly frightened right now, due to all of what I have read and seen on here, and realizing I'm living upstairs again is scaring the shit out of me(I'll explain later on). I'm not too good at writing, so bear with me as I try to tell you of my old memories.

I'm going to give you a little background before I tell you of what had happened.

This whole thing begins with when I was a really young kid, from the ages of 7-11. I used to live in a large blue house In Boise, the blue house we'd call it. It was a relatively old house, had a lot of history to it, including the death of my great great uncle Earl.

Like I said earlier, it was kind of an old house, and being old the floorboards, stairs, doors, all of those things would creak and make sounds when stepped on or opened/closed. I would hear the random creak of a floorboard or stair-step now and then, as you normally would, and with the walls being somewhat thin sound traveled a lot more, and to say the least, it could be a little frightening at times. I had finally grown out of sleeping with my parents completely and had moved into my own room in the upstairs part of the house. The stairwell had doors that would completely close it off, one being at the bottom, the other at the top, and they were usually closed. They sort of mocked me(again, I will explain later) every night for the many years I lived there. Why they did and why I'm talking so much about these stairs I will tell you.

We had lived in the house for not but 3 months or so, and we were still getting used to it. One night, I was laying in bed, trying to fall asleep, when I heard something. I heard the stairs creaking and the occasional thud. I ignored it at first, because I thought it was one of the normal random sounds, but it continued, and when I listened in closer I realized someone was walking up the stairs, but it was at a very, very slow pace. Curious as to why either of my parents was awake, I got up and walked over to the door to the stairwell and opened it. Nobody was there. Not only was no one there, the door at the bottom of the stairs was closed. I stood there in shock for a moment, not knowing what to think, and then, I heard another step. I jumped into my bed and quickly hid under the covers. The footsteps ceased. Though I was scared out of my mind, I had the impulse to look at my doorway(my room didn't have a door) and when I saw no one there, I started to slowly get up(why!?). Before I had even left my bed, the footsteps started again, this time going down the stairs. So, again, as a frightened little child, I hid under the covers and closed my eyes as tight as I could. The footsteps going up and down, up and down continued for an hour or so, maybe even longer; I fell asleep so I'm not really sure if they continued through the night. The next morning, I confronted my parents about the incident, and they told me of my great great uncle Earl that had died in the room across from mine.

Every night I would hear the same thing, over and over again, up and down, up and down, until I started sleeping on the couch downstairs. Though I was basically on the other side of the house, I still heard the footsteps, and my brothers had begun to notice them too. This continued for months.

Over half a year later, something happens that I really just have a hard time describing. By now, I've moved back into my room and the footsteps only occur every once in a while. My little brothers and I were up late one night playing around, just being kids. We stayed up very late that night, almost 1am or 2am. Very soon after it reached about that time, they had passed out and I went to my bed. The footsteps started happening right after that, but this time, they were louder. What was the most frightening was that for the first time ever, the stepping reached the top of the stairs. I was very, very, afraid at this point, especially after realizing that the door to the stairwell was open. I heard the steps move into the room across from mine, my little brothers' room. I quickly got up and walked over to their open door. What I saw haunts me still. There was what appeared to be an apparition, this black cloud, lingering in front of me. I stood there, frightened, shocked, dumbfounded, and frozen. After a few seconds, it had faded away. I never fell asleep that night.

The following nights were arguably worse if not as bad. Of course, the footsteps continued, but there was something else now. A voice. I heard the voice of a man mumbling, that would get louder and quieter as the footsteps would go up and down. The worst of the voice I heard was when I would hear my name. The footsteps would reach the top of the stairs, stop, then I would hear ""Jearin"" whispered quietly to the stairwell door.

The house is gone now, it was destroyed for the development of new homes. I visited the place where it once stood and took a brick from the last bit of remains of that house. I feel as if that brick is somehow drawing whatever was haunting me in that house back to me, but I'll hold onto it for now...

I'm 16 now, living with my grandparents in their home, which I believe to also be haunted. All of what I said is true, it is no lie, my mother, step-dad at the time, and brothers can all confirm the footsteps. They never saw what I had seen, or heard what I had heard. I will never forget any of it.

During the entire time I was writing this I have been hearing sounds that resemble movement somewhere upstairs. I'll ignore them for now, but the way the remind me of when I lived in that blue house is very, very frightening.

36,This noise is terrifying me.,1298017180,"It is 3 o'clock in the morning and I am writing this at my desk in my room.  I cannot go to sleep.  I am terrified.  I do not know what to do.

I feel like my situation needs a little context to be understood, and maybe writing out this story will be a helpful distraction.  When I was 8 years old I went to my first summer camp.  My sister, who is two years older than me, had been going to this camp for awhile.  For some reason I spent most of my time hanging out with her and her older friends.  One of the kids was this great storyteller.  Normally he'd talk about the cool stuff he did on vacation or whatnot and I was always fascinated by what he had to say.  However, one day he decided to tell a ghost story.  I'm sure most of you have heard the Bloody Mary tales and not thought much of them, but when you are 8 years old they scare the shit out of you.  After he was done talking it was pretty obvious to my sister and company that I was petrified.  They decided to mess with me, and one by one went into the bathroom to chant her name three times.  After they'd all gone in they told me it was my turn.  I adamantly refused.  They continued to pressure me, but I couldn't handle it and ran away on the verge of tears.

That story scarred me.  For months I absolutely could not be in a bathroom with the door closed and the lights off.  I grew up in an old house which the original owners had built by hand.  For some reason they put all the switches for the bathroom lights on the outside of the doors.  My sister, knowing my fear, thought it was hilarious to turn the lights out on me while I was doing my business.  This would result in a pants-around-my-ankles terrified leap towards the door to turn them back on.  One time her timing was so ""appropriate"" that I wound up dropping a deuce, mid leap, right there on the floor.  Talk about humiliating.

After months of this tormenting I decided to man up and face my fear.  It had worked for roller coasters maybe it would work for Bloody Mary too.  So I did it.  I closed the door, turned the lights out, spun around and said her name. Once... twice... at this point my heart was pounding... three times.

Nothing.  It was just a story.  I could finally poop in peace.

That night I went to bed feeling relieved.  I remember thinking ""This is what it feels like to be a big kid"".  I was on such a high I even let my dad turn out the hallway light without throwing a hissy fit.  That high didn't last long.  Just as I began to fade into slumber I started to hear this ominous sound.  At first I thought it was my cat playing with one of his jingle bell toys, but the clanging was too rhythmic.  I listened more intently trying to figure out what was making this noise.  I could hear what sounded like something heavy being dragged and then dropped.  Suddenly it dawned on me, I shot up from my bed in horror.  The boy at camp had said Bloody Mary was drowned in her own blood weighed down by chains.  When she would come to kill whoever had summoned her, that person would hear her dragging her chains as she came.

I had never been more terrified in my short 8 year life than I was at this moment.  I was convinced I was going to die.  I sat up in my bed, heart racing waiting for a pale ghostly figure to burst through my door and rip me apart limb by limb.

This continued for weeks.  Every night I'd lie awake for hours, tormented by this sound.  I tried to tell my parents, but they told me it was just my imagination, and after a while I began to believe them.

Then one day it stopped.  I don't remember when exactly, I just remember not hearing it anymore.  Years went by and I grew up.  I passed it off as my mind playing tricks on me; typical for an 8 year old.

But that all changed last night.  It was really late and I had just finished my physics homework.  I turned off my alarm knowing I could sleep in on Thursdays and snuggled into bed.  When soundly the sound came back.  I recognized it immediately, but I did not believe it.  This could not be happening.  I do not believe in ghost.  I was convinced that this was just a childhood phase. But I could hear the chains dragging and they were louder then ever.

I managed to fall asleep sometime after my roommate woke up.  I went to class and passed it off as some sort of hallucination.  I hadn't been getting much sleep and I starting taking a break from weed about a week ago.

But the sound is back.  It is echoing through my skull as I am writing this.  I do not know what to do.  I do not believe this is real.  I feel like I am 8 years old again and I never thought I would be that scared again.

37,It came in the night. ,1298016298,"Before I begin my story, I'll need to give a little background info so you guys know what all went on in that house. So my uncle bought a house in Commerce, Tx a few years ago and when he bought it, it was in terrible condition. When we first entered the house, all the furniture was still there. Food was still left on the table, pantry and fridge. The walls were covered in stickers that read ""Jesus loves me"" (there was one on the door) and there were paintings and bibles all over the place. This really creeped us out. We later found out that the house belonged to an old couple but we don't know what exactly happened to them.

So fast forward about 3 years. I was spending the night at my uncles house and my cousins and I slept in the living room. I slept right next to my then 2 yo cousin Nestor. So, I wake up in the middle of the night and I hear Nestor talking. And so I think he's just talking in his sleep.. Well, I turn around and I see him sitting up and talking to something and he's saying ""You're here!"" and that's when I started feeling afraid. He keeps talking and pointing so I try to stay calm and I call him to make sure he's not being weird in his sleep. So I say ""Nestor, who are you talking to?"" and that's when he turns around and says ""the man"" I was freaking the fuck out! (I was only 15 at the time) I didn't know what the fuck to do. I didn't see anyone. All I could say was ""go back to sleep"" so he looks up and says goodbye to the ""man"". It was hard to sleep after that. 



Another thing that really freaks me out is that my uncle and most of my cousins have seen a little boy walking around their house. My uncle and my aunt were laying in bed one night and their door was closed. But they have one of those doors that have a window on them (it's weird, I know) but they covered it up with a cloth for privacy. So they're sitting in bed talking and my two older cousins pass by the hall an you see both their shadows and hear heir footsteps.. But then came another. My uncle saw the shadow of a little boy following my cousins as they walked across the hall. So he tells my cousins to pass by the hall again. And again, the little boy's shadow followed. 



This little boy has made other appereances. One time at a party, everyone was outside and one ofthe guests says ""who's little boy is inside?"" and everyone looks confused. All the kids were outside.  She claims to have seen a little boy walk from the living room into the master bedroom.  ",nosleep,MelissaMacabre,/r/nosleep/comments/fnrsq/it_came_in_the_night/

People wanted pictures, so after gathering up some courage, I payed another visit, during the day, with a friend.  I only took pictures of the house, since that's around the place where the climax of my story happened.


The album is [here](http://imgur.com/a/Bfadr#R1u6M).  (The last picture in the album is supposed to be the first.  My bad)


Sorry that I didn't show any proof, like me holding up a sign that says ""hi, reddit.""  It didn't come to mind until after we the farm.


Seeing that there was evidence of people coming to the house in the past, I felt more relaxed that this place wasn't unvisited.  One thing I want to ask is about the plant on the front door.  What is that?  I didn't want to touch it and I didn't bother taking a closer picture at the time. (sorry)  Is there any significance of it being placed on the door knob?  It's creepy because it wasn't there, or at least I think it wasn't, when I was there last time.


I also recorded a video of my friend and I visiting.  I wasn't thinking of uploading it, but something happened in it that I want explained, if possible.


The video took place before the pictures, and entering from the front.  The pictures are us going through the house again from the back.  The video handling quality is poor and my friend talks and cusses a lot.  It makes him less anxious.  I recommend watching it in high quality, to see in the darker rooms.


The video is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuS51cDkGxE).


Here's the part that I want explained.  What the heck is that crackling and rattling sound?  It progressively gets more frequent as we continue going into the house and it gets the loudest when I look at the right corner of the back room.  I filmed myself again walking around my house and watched it, only to find that the crackling didn't appear.  Does Nosleep have any explanations?


One last question.  Seeing that there is no back door, and the front door is missing the bottom part, is this house eligible for playing the Midnight Man game?

40,Extremely Disturbing Dream.,1298011558,"I am an empath/medium so I often have prophetic dreams thus why this disturbed me so deeply. This was the ""show"" that played out in my head last week...
Started out with me reclining on the bed in a strange room surrounded by windows. I was watching my husband, (I am white, my actual husband is white), who was a foreign (Arab or Egyptian), ambassador. There was gunshots outside the window and he grabbed his gun from it's holster on his body and pushed me back onto the bed as I sat up to see what was going on. Outside the window in front of me appeared a young man and he started yelling something in a foreign language and pointing inside the window. He was shot multiple times and I ran for the kids.
There were two boys ages 9 and 4, three girls, 16, 12 and 10. There was also a grandmother (mine, or the dream mother I was, I am assuming), she looked like Bea Arthur. I remember what they all looked like and what they were wearing...1970's style clothing. The 9 yr old was grown up and narrating the scene playing out. 
I remember being terrified, holding the 4 yr old in my lap and trying to encompass the other children...there were windows all around us and a mob looking inward, staring at us...I can still see the faces. The 9 yr old was under the billiard table (right across from me) with his father, I was trying to make myself smaller on the corner of a wall. Guns started going off and bullets were flying everywhere! The 4 yr old was shot as I held him (disturbing on an extreme level because I have a 4 yr old boy in RL), as I looked around the corner I saw the girls and their grandmother assassinated, shot through the heads as they sat on the couch in an alcove of sorts. The grown up 9 yr old was still speaking as I started to fade out of the scene...I assume I was shot and dying as well.

I am still, a week later, disturbed by this dream and somehow convinced that this actually took place...it was that detailed and realistic.

Amy was a 22 year old  student, who also worked long hours as a waitress, and would often come home and pass out from exhaustion, as many of us do. Her apartment was small but comfortable, and her best friend was her calm and loving golden retriever.  One night, after a particularly long shift, she walked home around 1am. She wasn't naive, and always had mace  in hand when walking home that late. She walked a a quick pace, eyes open and observant, when she noticed a man with dark hair up ahead of her that was walking in a circular pattern. His eyes were closed, and he was wearing ragged clothes. Another meth junkie, she was sure. Luckily, she was at her stoop already, and as she made her last glance at him he had stopped and was staring at her, large unblinking eyes, head tilted. She quickly slammed the building door, and ran upstairs to her apartment and, like a scared child running up stairs at night, quickly unlocked her door and slammed it behind her.  Her dog greeted her happily and also signaled his need to go to the bathroom. outside. She would have paid a million dollars to have a cat instead at that point, but she couldnt stand to see her poor dog suffer, so she leashed him and opened her door to see HIM right outside it! the junkie was 4 feet away from her, being led into her neighbors apartment. After a look of shock silently communicated to her neighbor, an older, quiet woman, she explained that he was her son who was going through a hard time and had taken to shooting meth and lsd, but that he was really harmless.  Amy nodded, even though she was still in shock. She quickly took her dog out, and hurried upstairs to pass out. She reached for the door knob and realized that in the excitement of her neighbors explanation, she forgot to lock her door on her way out.
Slightly nervous, she took a quick look around and determined all was clear and settled into bed. Her dog took his normal post, sleeping on the floor on her side of the bed. She petted his head, and quickly fell asleep.

Later that night, she awoke suddenly, still extremely groggy, but conscience enough to know she had heard something.:::DRIP.DRIP.DRIP.::: ""damn leaky shower"" she thought.  she looked around the room, and collapsed back to the pillow, and hung her hand over the side of the bed, and her dog calmly liked her hand, as to lull her back to sleep. 
What seemed like only a moment later, she awoke again in the same state, but this time, a little more peeved and tired ::: DRIP.DRIP.DRIP.::: and without even opening her eyes, flipped onto her back, a kicked her covers off in an attempt to get more comfy, slid her hand over to her side to feel for her dependable dogs head, gave him a pat and almost immediately passed out again. 
Around 3:30 am, she awoke for a third time, this time sitting straight up, rubbing her eyes, and flipping her bedside light on. :::DRIP.DRIP.DRIP.::: "" UGH.  SO annoying"" she whispered to herself. she flipped her legs off the bed and noticed that her dog was not in his spot. Confused, she got up and turned on her overhead light, and called for him. nothing. 
She walked to the kitchen, she called him again.
nothing.
Finally, she walked into the bathroom and casually flipped on the light, pulled off her undies to pee, and when she stood up, she thought to check her spare room, when she heard it again ::DRIP.DRIP.DRIP.::
In annoyed frustration, she yanked to shower curtain open and froze in absolute terror.

In the shower, her dog was hanging from the shower head, belly slit open, with a note that read:

HUMANS CAN LICK HANDS TOO.

and the only sound besides Amy's screaming was the blood draining down. 

:::DRIP.DRIP.DRIP:::


The police never found him. His mother said that as soon as she finished talking to Amy, she and her son got in a fight and he left the apartment again, which is when, the police suspect, he casually entered Amy's apartment when she was out with her dog. he then hid under her bed until she was asleep.

The rest is.. well... you can put it together.

43,The tall man with a mustache,1298000606,"  So, this happened when I was younger (about 12 or so), but it has stuck with me ever since.


  A friend of mine, Leo, who originally lived a few blocks away from my parents was having a sleepover with me and we were up late.  He had been my best friend for years, but his family had moved away about a year previous, so whenever they came back into town, his parents would let them hang out and have a sleepover.


   So, its getting to be probably around 2 o'clock in the morning, and Leo and I are still awake, bullshitting and talking, which is nothing out of the ordinary.  Whenever we had these sleepovers, wed just spend the night playing Sega or watching movies.  Leo is in the bottom bunk, and Im in the top bunk, and hes telling me a story about this girl hed had a crush on, when I spotted someone out in the other room.


  My room was in the basement, just off a larger room that had a pingpong table and tv and all that, and in my family, the kids all called it the ""rumpus room"".  So were both sitting in bed and I could swear that I saw a tall, thinner looking man with a mustache in the rumpus room.  My step-dad looked very much like this, and it being dark, I assumed it was him coming down to tell us to knock it off and go to sleep.


  I said ""Hey Gord"" and Leo said ""Hey Gord"" as well.  On the top bunk, I cant even begin to describe how creepy it was when the taller gentleman walked into my room and stood in the center.  He was about 6 feet tall, gaunt, and just seemed like he was somewhere else completely.  The best way I can think of to describe it is that he didnt seem like he knew he was in the room.  He seemed like he was somewhere else, and was just appearing in front of us.  Not out of place, but out of *time* if that makes sense.  His clothes seemed almost victorian, as he seemed pretty well dressed to the nines, with a suit and overcoat and fancy tie.


  So, realizing this clearly wasnt my step-dad, Im obviously beginning to freak out, wondering who this creepy guy is in my room, when he just sort of faded out.  It wasnt an instantaneous thing, he just slowly became less defined until he wasnt there anymore.  Im now sitting on the top bunk, trying to act cool.  Leo hasnt said anything, and Im trying to rationalize the situation.  Its late, Im tired, and I mustve been mistaken about seeing someone.  Leo must have just said ""Hey Gord"" because hed heard me say it and assumed he was there.


  So what seemed like 15 minutes, but was probably closer to 15 seconds go by, and Im still trying to rationalize this thing, when Leo, from the bottom bunk, says ""Did......did you see that guy that was here just now?""


  We both freak the fuck out, and camp out on the top bunk together with the lights on for the rest of the night, and Leo left the next day.  I didnt see him a lot after that and the whole thing just kind of slipped my mind like things sometimes do when youre younger.
  A few years later, I remembered the whole thing but was feeling pretty skeptical about it, assuming it couldnt have happened the way I remembered it.  I told people the story and most were creeped out by it, but still, I had started to wonder if maybe in the years of telling it, Id made a shadow or something wed seen into this supernatural boogeyman.
 About a year or so ago,I tracked down Leo on Facebook.  I sent him a message saying hello and all that and then asked him if hed remembered it happening.  He said ""Dude.  Of course I remember that.  Ive been telling that story to people for years.  It was fucking crazy.""  He even remembered telling me my Simpsons blanket creeped him out because Bart Simpson was saying ""Sweet dreams, man""

50,Weird stuff and death.,1297978386,"First, forgive my grammar mistakes and the broken english. (I'll glady correct the mistakes that you point out).

My house is fairly new (1995), nothing really weird happened for a long time, of course there wasn't a reason for it, no dead people, not a ancient tribe cemetery, nop. 
However, in the year 2003 maybe 2004 I woke up one morning and my sister (5 years older than me) looks at me with this weird face and asked me: ""Where you on my door looking at me last night?"", I looked back at her and said: ""Hell no, i was sleeping"". She told me that she woke up at 3 am with this weird feeling of being watched she turned her cellphone light and saw me looking at her at the door, she closed her eyes and when she opened them again I was gone. 
At the moment I thought my sister was either crazy or she dreamed it, and never believed the Sleep walking theory. 

Some months later my GF (at that moment) stayed for the night (I was 17 and she was 16), I gave her my room and I slept in the Sofa. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper... its hard to wake me up... so in the middle of that night I felt this heavy punches in my back, I woke up a little bit frightened and saw my GF's even more frightened face, she was pale and asked me: ""Did you just stand in the door watching me sleep?"", to what I replied: ""HELL NO!"", she didn't know the story my sister had told me... but I did and I got really scared for a moment, she slept with me that night, in the morning I told her the story and she never stayed at my house again... ( FAILED). 

My family and I started to speculate about what could had happened. Theory #1, Me sleep walking... I refused that theory because I just didn't felt that was the reason, I know its ilogical thinking... but the situation was weird. Theory #2 they were just dreaming. We lived another month with any of those theories as the truth, and everyone was happy again, until...

One night I was staying at my GF's house and suddenly in the middle of the night I receive a call,
- it was my sister- I answered specting the worse (you know.. family calling in the middle of the night? can't be good news) and she told me: ""PEPITO (her boyfriend, now husband)[His name isn't Pepito] told me he just saw you!"" I went pale. What happened was that Pepito was sleeping in the sofa and woke up to go to the bathroom, when he opened his eyes he saw me in the hallway standing. 

After that incident everyone in the house was a little afraid of what was happening, and everybody blamed me... because I was being an asshole for proyecting my soul... or something like that. It turned out that from that moment, my house became diferent... I heard my mom calling me even though she wasn't in the house, we heard steps on the stairs, etc. A little time after my dog died. He got ill for some reason and died. My grandmother (may she rest in peace) told us that the ""evil spirits"" took always the weakest member of the family, and it was usually the pets. We didn't thought much of it at that time, but our next dog died just a year after he came to the house and after that, my cat lasted only 6 months. The sounds and voices activity usually rised before one of my pets died, so I became a little bit scared about what grandma said. After that we didn't had pets for a while, the usual creepy stuff happened and grandma died (2008).

I tell the story so lightly because I'm a bit of an skeptic, atheist and all. So I've always tried to ignore all this stuff, and even if the sounds and voices were from a supernatural source, I thought the deads after were just coincidence. Until today.  

For the las 2 years (dec 2008 - to the date) not much happened here in the house, everything was pretty normal and I almost forgot about ""our ghost"" or whatever it is. But yesterday  right when I went to bed I heard the noices again, the door of my room opened and closed twice... I told my self it was the wind that did that, eventhough at night the whole house is closed because I, personally, put the alarm on. I fell sleep, I don't know how long after that I started to feel that something was looking at me, just standing there beside me. I refused to open my eyes, and convinced myself that I was dreaming. Today, my cat died :(. 

I know it doesn't sound as creepy as many other stories here in r/nosleep, but as an (ex?)skeptic I can not longer fool myself and I'm trully scared of whats in this house.

TL;DR: I live in fear now.

Ps: I live in Chile, I speak spanish.

58,I had this dream a couple nights ago. The dreams bad but it gets worse.,1297953660,"Everytime I have told this story I get goosebumps and the hair on my head stands up, so I figured I would share.

Backstory:
I live at my girlfriends house with her family, I sleep in the guest bedroom. The house has A LOT of ghost activity.

Dream: 
So my girlfriend had family coming over and I had to park their car for them. I got in the car and realized I had no idea where they wanted it, so I put in some ""magic"" eye drops. I said to myself ""Where am I supposed to park this?"" You know when you stare into a light you see that light purple/black spot? A line of that color and faintness was drawn (Donnie Darko refrence in my dream?) and I followed it to where it ended and parked the car. I walked into the house and tried to find something (Can't remember if it was keys or my DS) but I muttered to myself ""Where is my X"" and again, the line was drawn to where I needed to go. By now I figured out what the drops did and was excited about it, never lose anything again? Yes! So I walk into my girlfriends room (which is empty) and remembered that this house is haunted. I wondered if this would work... ""Where is the nearest ghost?"" A line was drawn right in front of me and stopped right next to her bed. All of a sudden I was filled with dread. I love ghosts and scary things but this was different. This was bad. I did not want to be here anymore. I turned to run out of the room but tripped, over nothing. Then I heard a laugh, more of a cackle behind and above me, where the line had stopped. I was being pulled back! I scrambled to my feet and ran out of the room. I awoke shortly after.

The Reality:
Needless to say I was very excited about the dream that as soon as my girlfriend woke up I told her. When I got to the ghost part though her smile faded. When I finished the dream I asked her why she looked more serious. She told me years ago she had to sleep in her sisters bedroom for two years, refusing to even enter her room, because a woman ghost kept her awake for three days by laughing...right next to her bed...",nosleep,Dead_Skull,/r/nosleep/comments/fn7qv/i_had_this_dream_a_couple_nights_ago_the_dreams/

71,"The FIRST Time ""It"" Happened",1297896871,"OK, so! This is true. I know, it's all true on nosleep, but for real. I have not really ever talked about this before, but after reading about a similar experience by someone else on the recent r/askreddit thread about the creepiest thing that has ever happened to you, I found r/nosleep and decided to share.

I was 14 and I woke up from a really vivid dream. I mean, I remembered everything really clear, which is strange, because I've never remembered details from dreams, even now. But this dream stood out because it was very particular. I was in a low-ceiling room, a hall way of some sort, with cinder block walls painted a really dull beige color. I was sort of on my tip-toes, looking through a window that was set into a big metal door. I was looking outside, into a sort of stairwell at my little brother (7 at the time) who was playing on the stairs.

""Hey, get in here!"" I yelled at him. In my dream, I wanted to something to eat. I remembered opening the door for my brother and letting him in, going back through the hall and into the room we had come from and feeling sick because going back into the room made me remember why my brother and I were there to begin with: something had happened to my uncle.

Now, that's a lot to remember in a dream, I know, and I STILL remember it now. I wrote it down, even, which I never do, but it was so VIVID. That morning, even, being particularly spooked by the clarity of the dream I asked my mom, 

""Is Uncle [so-and-so, we'll call him Jim] doing OK?""

""Yeah"" I remember she looked at me like I was a weirdo, ""He's fine."" 

""Alright.""

Well, a couple weeks pass and nothing to it. I don't think I said anything else about the dream, or even thought about my uncle. Then, on Sunday night the phone rings and a few minutes later I hear my dad cry out.

I go downstairs, and my Uncle Jim has died of a heart attack. 

We lived in Ohio and my uncle lived in NY. I don't remember why it worked out this way, but my mom and and dad went to NY to be with my aunt. They took my older brother, but me and my younger brother were left to stay with my Grandma. We would be meeting them in NY in time for the funeral.

Monday, Tuesday they pass. Wednesday, my Grandma takes her to church with her. At church, they're having a meal like they always do on Wednesday night. It's downstairs in the fellowship hall and it's spread out all nice and delicious like a proper church potluck should be. Anyhow, I'm eating and my brother is with me, and he gets bored like a 7 yo does and decides to go off and play. Adhering to my filial duties, I go off looking for him, and end up in a hall. I go to look out the window at the door at the end of the hall, and there he is playing outside. 

""Hey get in here!"" I turned around back through the hall and I remember. I remember why I'm there, that my Uncle Jim is dead and that I had this dream and - I snapped. I mean, I went hysterical, I started crying, saying ""this already happened, this already happened"" over and over again. My grandma takes me into the fellowship hall, but she can't really calm me down. I was well and truly freaked out.

I've asked my brother about this once and he said, 'Oh yeah, the time you freaked out at Grandma's church?"" That was the first time (that I remember) having a dream that reflected reality. It's happened again, where I dream and then it happens (kept a dream journal) but never with a death, only good things.

But every time I dream of someone dying, I freak out a little, and brace myself.

73,I worked as a Night Security Guard,1297892375,"I worked as a night guard all of last year until January of this year. One particular place that I was assigned always gave me the creeps. I thought I'd share.

&gt; [You could probably skip most of this thang, I'll show you where to read for the funsies]

This one particular place was like any other warehouse. Palettes of merchandise on very large steel bins, forklifts, and stacks of merchandise that created what were basically hallways of stuff ready to be loaded onto trailers. 

Anyway, the responsibilities of the job were to do a nightly inventory of all of the trailers on the lot and basically lock up checking doors, lights, locks, and then open up in the morning for management and employees.

It was very boring and just a bit creepy. I mean, this place is very very big. There were about 20 loading bays in the front of the building and about 55 in the back. So basically, you had a good 5-10 minute hike from one side to the other. 
As I mentioned, inside there were stacks of merchandise that made tall walls and hallways. When I would shut it down I had to turn off the AC and lights at 3 different locations for 3 different areas of the warehouse. There was a 4th area, furthest from the main entrance, that we were told not to turn off the lights for, but shared AC controls on the 3rd control pannel.
I hated doing the interior patrol for the few first weeks. There were always little things that made my heart beat faster; in the darkness and silence you'd suddenly hear loud noises that would sometimes turn into VOICES! Then you realize that it was an alarm clock or a computer restarting or a compressor that was left on. Everything started to click and anytime I heard something or saw a weird flash it always had a reasonable explanation, nothing really phased me from that point - even if it did seem strange I'd chalk it off as static interpherence with the PA or echos.

I started to really warm to this place... especially when I started having my friends over. It was really fun playing football in the middle of the night inside a warehouse surrounded by boxes. It was really fun to have access to forklifts, power lifts, standing lifts (those fuckers are scarry as fuck if you're not strapped in and moving), and other heavy equipment you're not supposed to race around in a warehouse. lol

Anyway, one night I went into work and the guard before me goes up to me and says something along the lines of, ""I know what you've been doing at night"". SHIT, Pokeface the fuck up i did. I ask, ""What do you mean""? He then says a joke about jerking it and never turning off the lights on the far side of the warehouse. I ask how he knew I never turn off the lights on the far side. He then starts telling me a story about ""La Niña"". If you're at all familiar with creepy stories it's basically the same one... at every work place.

A dude that doesn't work there anymore denies he believes in anything, a week later this non-smoker is outside pale faced and smoking, when questioned he says, ""Vi La Niña"" or for those of you not familiar with Spanish ""I saw the little girl"". From that point forward he either becomes a believer or goes nuts. 

&gt; [You can start reading here for teh lols]

After he tells me the story I start laughing and he replies by saying how he is totally serious and then asks me, ""Why do you think nobody EVER turns off the lights on the far end."" I should have mentioned, nobody ever turns off the lights - I don't turn them off either because the dude that trained me just told me not to turn them off. I didn't question it because... I don't know, I figured it was company policy or something. The guy i'm relieving then says goodbye and I am kind of spooked. I do my inventory and my friends show up as I'm finishing. I don't mention the story I was just told. We play some football in that last lit section as we always do and I'm on full alert the whole night.

The next night they come over we're playing football, everything is the same. We decide to call it a night. As we're walking and having a few laughs we start entering the 3rd section (lights off). Then. from behind I hear some light foot steps. Hmm, did I really hear that? I kind of turn around, I catch my friends eye as he's turning back around. A few more steps we walk; I hear some murmuring coming from the back ""A radio I think"". We are walking deeper into the dark, everyone's pace goes up. When we hear some more murmuring and footsteps form the back... we all bolt. 

We all are seriously running on adrenaline by the time we are outside. We all confirm what we've seen. I explain the story I was told about the little girl, and my friend admits he saw something earlier out of the corner of his eye when we were playing football. Another says he felt a slight push before we all started running. 

As the week passes we all make the typical jokes and rationalize it was probably some mice or something. We don't really think about it until the next night we decide to meet up at my work. Now, we're all young and stupid and we decide to make things a little interesting that night by inviting another person to our meet up. ... and smoking a blunt.

My friends show up that night with another friend (blind to the events the previous night) and the goods. We smoke and I go finish my inventory. A friend of mine decides to accompany me as my other group of friends goes inside to explore and drive forklifts, basically giving the new guy the grand tour.

As I'm working on the inventory we start talking about the previous night and how we were all tripping and whatnot. We have a few laughs and then we hear a tapping. A tapping on the trailer door. No, it couldn't be. It's locked, nothing's inside it's just the big steel frame getting used to the temperature. I mean, big ass shit makes noise sometimes. Whatever. We laugh it off and move onto the next trailer to get it's info. Once again we hear some tapping. More rhythmic this time. It sounded kind of like when you knock on a bedroom door with your fingernails. We are seriously creeped out, but I have to finish my work and I don't want to go back. I brush it off and assume there's wind or something affecting it. The next trailer has no incident. We start to calm down. Until we walk up to the third trailer. We hear not only a tapping coming from the inside, the intensity of it is like nothing I've seen or heard. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. We just fucking look at each other and run towards the first door I see. As we're running we get even more freeked out when the birds in a nearby tree wake up. It was seriously freaky, those birds sounded fucking scary ""SCREEEEEEEEE-CAW-CAW-CAW"" and the whole tree was moving.

We go in expecting to see our friends having fun playing ball. Nope. We run in the dark towards the main entrance. Thankfully the rest of the pack is in the main break room. When we get there we're sweaty and laughing. We ask why they're there. They explain that the new friend saw something and then they all heard a kids laugh. 


Sorry this was so long. And probably not at all scary. lol 


TL;DR
I worked at a supposedly haunted place. I can't say everything made sense, but it was fun.

There is something stalking me. I don't know what it wants, but almost every night since I started seeing it, it has terrorized me. It doesn't touch me, it doesn't communicate in any sort of way, it just fills me with horror. If what I seem to ramble, please forgive me... I haven't slept in several days.

We live in the second floor of a duplex with stairs down the back of the house to the basement where the laundry machines are. There's a door at the bottom of the stairs before the door to the basement that looks out onto our back porch and into the back yard. Six days ago, I was going down to the basement to bring up some laundry and I glanced out the door as I passed. There was a figure standing at the far edge of our yard. Her back was to me, and she was just standing there, looking into the woods beyond our yard. She was dressed in nothing but a light gown. It had lots of flowing material coming off of it that was whipping around in the air slowly. The whole scene creeped me out instantly, but I thought she might be a friend of our downstairs neighbor, so I continued to the basement. When I came back up, she wasn't there.

The next night, I went down again, and as I passed the back door, I looked outside. The woman was back. She was exactly like she was the night before, facing away, not moving. The hair on my arms and neck stood up straight when I saw her. I was even more creeped out when I realized she was in the same clothes as the night before. That's when I did something I shouldn't have... I opened the back door. Leaning out, I called to her to see if she was okay. She didn't respond. She didn't make any sort of indcation that she'd heard me. It was freezing cold, so I shut the door and locked it. Coming back upstairs afterward, I looked out the window and she was gone again.

Later that same night, I was in the bedroom, getting ready to go to sleep. Everything was dark, because my wife had gone to bed before me. Our bedroom looks out over the backyard, and my side of the bed faces the windows, so I have to go past them to get in. As I was doing so, I suddenly got that same deep dread feeling in my stomach that I had gotten the first time I saw the figure in the backyard. Something compelled me to hesitate by the windows. My hands were shaking as I pulled the curtain back a bit and peeked through the shades into the backyard. It was a clear night, so the backyard wasn't shrouded in darkness. The woman was standing in the middle of the backyard, no longer at the edge of the woods, facing the house with her head tilted up to look directly at the window I was peeking from. I jerked away instantly, afraid she had seen me. Her face was covered in shadow and hair, but I saw her chin and nose. A sharp nose and a thin chin. Gray. Her skin looks gray, I think. Her hair is black and long. I was so scared, I jumped into bed and covered myself with the covers.

The next day, I played outside in the snow with my four year old daughter. She wanted me to pull her on her sled in the backyard, but just the thought of going back there made me scared again, so I talked her into digging holes in the snow in the front yard. That night, things went from bad to worse. Somehow, I had managed to forget about the woman. Then, in the middle of the night, my daughter started crying. Our bedroom is just across the hall from hers. I thought she might need to use the bathroom or just be having a bad dream, so I went into her room to see if she was okay. She was uncovered, curled into a ball on her mattress. I pulled her covers over her and that's when she whispered to me.

""Daddy, there's someone in my closet.""

Instant goosebumps. I turned my head slowly toward the closet door at the end of her bed. Normally, the closet is shut, but now it was open. The woman was standing in my daughter's closet. Not even when it was clear that I saw her did she move or make a sound, just stood there and looked at me through the cracked-open door. My blood ran cold when I saw her.

""Get up,"" I told my daughter, ""Get in my arms, quickly. QUICKLY."" she scrambled up and hugged me tightly and I walked backward out of the room, watching the closet the entire time. In my mind I imagined her throwing the closet door open and running at us, arms outstretched. I just hugged my daughter and walked backward into my room. The woman never appeared in the doorway. I heard no movement from my daughter's room. I tucked her into my bed and stood there watching the doorway to her bedroom. I did not go back in, I just stood there and watched and listened. When I finally got the courage to climb into bed, I didn't sleep.

Sunday, I told my wife everything. I told her about the first time I saw this woman, I told her about calling out to her and seeing her from the window. I told her that she had appeared in our daughter's closet. She told me it wasn't funny, that it was my fault for our daughter's bad dreams and that I shouldn't encourage her to be afraid of her closet.

Sunday night, my daughter called to me from her room again. Call me a coward, but I couldn't go back into that room. I called her quietly to come get in our bed, but she cried and said she was scared. I wanted to go and get her, but I was scared too. I told her to pull her blankets up and cover herself. *Just cover yourself, honey, and you'll be okay*. I prayed that it was true. I lay there, peeking over the sleeping form of my wife and out into the hallway at the closed door of my daughter's room and just kept praying. I heard her cry a while longer, then she went quiet and I hoped that she was asleep.

Monday, I piled toys in front of the door to her closet. By that time, there was no doubt in my mind that this was some sort of ghost or apparition, but I piled things in front of the closet anyway. Like a pile of toys could stop a ghost.

Monday night, my daughter did not cry, but I didn't sleep. I lay there, looking at the ceiling, tense. Around 2:00, I heard her bedroom door creak open and I knew something was wrong. *She must be scared,* I thought, so I called to her like before, ""Just come to me and you can sleep in our bed, Sweety."" But she didn't come. I peeked over my my wife.

The woman was standing there in the doorway to my daughter's room. Her arms hung at her sides, her shoulders slouched down. Her gown was dirty, like it hadn't been washed in years, and hung off her likes torn rags. I wasn't breathing, I wasn't blinking, I just looked at her and she looked at me and I thought *this is it, I'm going to die*. She never moved, never made a sound. I whispered, ""Please, go away. Please, leave me alone. Please, I'm sorry."" I couldn't look away. *If I look away, she will get closer*. I was sure of it. *If I close my eyes, when I open them, she'll be standing over me, looking at me*. At some point, she was gone. It's like I fell asleep with my eyes open. I don't remember her disappearing, just that I was looking at the doorway, and she wasn't there anymore.

Last night, I lay awake, waiting. I asked my wife to shut our bedroom door because the night light in the hallway was keeping me awake. It was stupid. I don't know what I was thinking. Like clockwork, I heard my daughter's bedroom door creak open. I held my breath. Then I heard the floorboards in the hallway creaking and I started shaking uncontrollably. I heard our bedroom door open, and I knew she was standing there, in the doorway, not moving, just looking at me. I didn't look. I couldn't. I did what had I told my daughter to do and pulled the covers over my head.

I am a complete mess. A zombie at work. I don't want to go home anymore. I think I see the woman in other places. A glance while driving and I think she's sitting in the passenger seat of the truck behind me, or standing down the street asI drive off. Just sitting here at my desk, someone passes by behind me and I jump. I'm afraid that if I turn around, she'll be there, waiting for me to look at her. And what if I saw her face? I don't want to see it. I don't want to see her anymore, but I don't know what to do. The only hope I feel is that, for unrelated reasons, my wife is talking about moving. But our lease isn't up until May. I don't know if I can hold out that long.",nosleep,wdalphin,/r/nosleep/comments/fmm3o/she_found_her_way_into_my_home/

Anyhow, a friend of mine asked me about her dog, she said that she was a couple of years old Boxer / Staffy cross and that all of a sudden the dog had began to go downstairs at night and growl at one of the interior (closed) doors, and then just lay down and stay there till the following day when she got up.

I told her she might just have left a toy in there or something, but my friend said that she could quite happily get onto her back legs and open the door - and indeed she used to do.

Aside from that I had no ideas about why the dog was doing this, there had been no strangers or anything in the house or anything that could maybe have left an unusual smell. I told her there are some plugins you can buy that mimic the pheromones of a pupping bitch, maybe that could calm her down.

I was away working in Liverpool so had not seen her for a while. One night she called just before midnight. After apologising for calling so late she said that Maisie (the dog) had at first laid by her bed, then had gone downstairs.

Rather than just growl she had gone beserk this time - barking and spitting at the (same) door - she wouldn't come back upstairs and was a dead-weight when my friend tried to drag her away by her fancy collar - even after bribing with her favourite treats. She asked, did I have any advice?

I asked if she had opened the door to let the dog into the room - she said that she hadn't thought of that as the dog could get in on her own if she wanted to - she kept the doors shut to keep the heat in the house.

""Maybe you should go down and show her there is nothing to be worried about in the room?"" I said.

She told me that was a good idea and she would call back once Maisie had gone to sleep.

That's the last I ever heard of her or the dog. I tried to ring around after she stopped answering my calls but no-one had seen her. She worked for herself so there was no work or family to check with.

After a couple of days I made an excuse for having to go back home because I was concerned and didn't know how to reach her neighbours. 

When I got to the house all the blinds were shut and there was mail hanging out of the letterbox - along with [this](http://imgur.com/X14rl) hanging on the door knob.

82,Happed twice. (True story),1297870055,"This happened a year and a half ago. It was a normal day and it was most likely a weekend and my family was having a cookout and decided to invite my aunts and uncles and some cousins. Usually the cookout was always in our backyard since that is were we had the grill and such.
So everyone was outside and it was in the afternoon around 5:30 or 6pm, everyone is having a wonderful time talking, and relaxing. Then i had an urge to go to the restroom, so i went inside my house.(just to give you a brief description about the layout of the hallway of where the restroom is at...the restroom is in a long hallway with 3 rooms on one side. My room comes first, then its the restroom, then its my older brother's room.) 
   When i was finished with my buisness, as soon as i exited the restroom, i heard and errie, yet clear voice say ""Heyyy matthhewwww.."" (and Mathhew is my name, incase i didn't mention that.) at that moment i thought it was my older brother trying to scare me like he always does, so i looked behind me where his room is and i see nothing. his room is just dark as i peeked inside it. I even peeked inside my room, but i still found nothing, there was no one in the house at the moment. So at that point i just quickly walked back outside and tried to forget about it.
a year passes by and i experience the same voice again, but in a different way. 
So at this time i am 17 years old in high school and its the morning and im eating my breakfast while my parents had just recently left to goto work. so while im eating my cereal at the table which is near the kitchen and my parent's room, i hear it again...I hear ""hey mattheewww.."" i look behind me toward my parent's room, and as i peeked in it i see nothing but darkness as they had just recently left it, so i closed the door and quickly finished my food and tried to forget about the inicident and turned off the tv and grabbed my stuff and left for school.
  funny thing about this is that i told my brother and his response was ""Matthew your starting to sound like a scheitzofrenic (if thats how you spelled it)""   ",nosleep,VeritableParadox,/r/nosleep/comments/fmic0/happed_twice_true_story/

Here I am, left behind, either by my own misguided sense of justice, or by other people’s lack of reason. I raise my voice for equality, showing my good results and improvement, yet I am smitten down as it is obvious i am subservient to the commands of others. I show my good will, yet it is cast in another daylight by them and myself. I think without reason, but with doubt, blaming things I think are the blame, in the end it lies with me, but I just made some notes, I just made some notes.

Appreciation there was a lack off, I lost my power and broke the time, forgetting what I was trying to prove. What I was trying to save, ignoring my responsibility, ignoring what I had promised myself, promised others. I asked a bystander, but he turned out to be a demon, I knew this of it, but it still annoyed me. From its perspective I would think differently, but I’m not a demon.
I hear the song of the morning birds, even though it doesn’t feel the time. I block myself from the light with temporary and permanent avail. The noises I hear are disturbing, reminding me of another time. I try to counter the noise with noise of my own, yet it was an unworthy attempt.

A piece from the gate was missing, due to the lack of time, screaming it was someone’s fault, but I knew it would be mine. Punishment lays ahead, but with that I’m fine. Here I am having woken late.

95,The most frightening person in the world is my infant son.,1297827965,"Ever since my son was born, I've been a really light sleeper. I wake up several times during the night to check on him, because I'm paranoid about SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). I'll usually wake up, roll out of bed and walk over to his crib (which is about 3 feet away on my wife's side of the bed). I'll hover my hand over his face to feel his breath, or place my hand on his chest to make sure he's OK.  The thought of losing him is absolutely the most terrifying thing I can imagine. 

About 6 weeks ago, I awoke for one of these midnight checks. I had only been asleep a couple hours, it was roughly 2 AM. I should mention that my son was 4 months old at the time. His most recent accomplishment was his newfound ability to roll from his stomach to his back. So you'll understand why when I sat up in bed and looked over to his crib, I could feel all the blood drain from my face.

He was *standing*. Standing, with his head wobbling back and forth, side to side,  in that incredibly awkward and unnerving way that babies do. His arms aimlessly waving around in what *should* have been a vain attempt to gain balance. And he was looking at me the whole time, smiling. This was unnatural. 

I woke my wife, quietly, so that she could tell me I wasn't crazy. My son watched intently and smiled the whole time. As soon as she focused her eyes on the baby, his expression changed. He was terrified. He let out one long scream for about 3 seconds, the same way he does when the doctor gives him a shot, and then fell onto his back in the crib. 

We both jumped up and went to his crib, he was on his back, crying , very upset. We just pretend it didn't happen, it's the easiest way to deal with it.",nosleep,kromagnon,/r/nosleep/comments/fmame/the_most_frightening_person_in_the_world_is_my/
