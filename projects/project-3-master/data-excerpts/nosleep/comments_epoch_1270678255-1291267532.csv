2,Sick Cat,1291246366,"This is something that happened to my family about six or so years ago. We live in the country with our house surrounded by trees and the woods. While we don't have any neighbors immediately next to us, there are people who live around. Often times, random cats will show up at our house in varying stages of wildness and hunger. My parents, for all they complain about how expensive it is to feed a bunch of animals, are really soft-hearted and always set out extra food for any stray who happens along. We've acquired several of our pets this way. 


One afternoon (indecently, the day before Halloween), my mother went outside to feed our cats. We probably had about five cats at the time. Since we practically live in the woods, we keep the cat food stored in the garage because otherwise possums and raccoons would get into it and generally make a mess. The cat's food and water bowls are kept just outside the door for easy access. So, my mother fed and watered the cats, and was inside putting away the scoop, when she noticed that one of the cats had strayed into the garage. It should be noted that my dad doesn't like the cats being inside for fear they'll poop in hard to reach places, and that it was dimly lit because mom hadn't turned the light on, as the outside light was sufficient for her task. 


Anyway, mom scooped up the cat and carried it outside. This was when she realized that all the cats were around the food dishes, crunching away. My mother, showing much more fortitude than I'll ever have, calmly looked at her hand to realize she was holding a strange and rather unresponsive cat. She gently sat the poor thin creature down near the food, where it laid, seemingly unaware that edibles were near. Our cats refused to get near the new addition. 


For the rest of the afternoon and into the evening, Sick Cat barely moved and didn't eat. At no point did our cats go near it, even to chase it away as they sometimes do with strange cats. Finally, my dad decided that Sick Cat was in it's last hours, and that shooting it was the kindest course of action. 


My dad got his .22 and went outside. Here I will note that it was still light, my dad is a great shot, and he was standing about five feet in front of where Sick Cat was sitting. My dad took careful aim, wanting to quickly and cleanly put Sick Cat out of it's misery. He fired, and Sick Cat fell over. 


This is the odd part. My dad aimed for Sick Cat's head, but there was there was no obvious entrance or exit wound. There was no blood either, none leaking from the nose or mouth or, as would be expected. It was like the bullet had missed and Sick Cat had just keeled over at the exact moment my dad fired. 


Of course, it's worth noting that a .22 bullet is small, so an entrance wound wouldn't be obvious. It's also possible that the bullet traveled down and eventually stopped in Sick Cat's body, therefore making no exit wound. Still, the whole incident was really weird, and at the time I was convinced that my dad had killed a demon cat who would at any minute hobble back into our yard to take it's revenge. 


Edit: My dad's theory is this: There are rumors that a couple of miles from our house is a cave next to the [Viaduct](http://www.flickr.com/photos/21365713@N08/2173870938) where Satanic rituals are held. My dad figures that since it was near Halloween, some kids were doing something that involved cat's blood. Sick Cat, then, was just a victim of animal cruelty who happened to escape before being completely exsanguinated. My issue with this theory is that it's a long walk from that part of the train tracks to our house for a severely injured cat. Plus, it doesn't explain why our cats avoided Sick Cat.

4,Since I won't be sleeping tonight I figures this would be appropriate. This is the only supernatural thing I have experienced with others present.,1291207974,"This happened when I was 15-16. I was a budding atheist, and straight edge to the extreme (didn't even drink caffeine). I enjoyed those ghost shows and such a lot, but this, this was very different. 

So my friend's house is where he and I and the rest of our band practiced a couple times every week. We practiced in the basement, in the room with the water heater. There was one bare bulb that dangled from the ceiling, and one window that was always dirty and never opened. Before he moved in, an old lady had lived there. I didn't know her or press for information on the subject, but the house went up for sale when it was already empty. 

This place was already creeping with bad vibes. My friend had an alcoholic stepfather who would cause conflict on a daily basis (there was only physical contact once, and my friend pulled out a butterfly knife, which promptly ended said contact). His mother cared for his sister a lot, and in recent years to this incident, given up hope for her son. He was goth for all intents and purposes. 

At first, the incidents were very mild. I was sleeping on the couch while my friend practiced drums in the next room. All of a sudden I get these ominous feelings of dread, and sit up on the couch. I look over to the garage door, and see a blurry spot hanging in the air, faintly obscuring the wall behind it. I blame this on my contacts, yet still cannot explain the feeling I had. I yell to my friend, who steps out from behind the drumset and stands in the doorway. I tell him about the feeling I had. He points behind me and states blandly ""you mean that?"" He was referring to that same blurry spot (it moved about 6 feet in the time it took him to reach the doorway). I decide that nap time is over, and pick up my bass. 

A few weeks later, we were in his room and it was night time. We avoided the basement at night because it was just all too creepy with just the two of us. We are waiting for his mom to get home from her waitressing job, as she is going to bring us dinner back. His door is closed, and we're talking bed-to-bed, both looking up. Finally, we hear his mom come in. We hear the door, then the creaky wooden floor as she goes into the kitchen, and then we finally hear her come down the hall. Excited for hot food, and completely famished, we open his door and head towards the kitchen. 

""Mom!"" he yells. We notice the living room light is off (she is constantly bitching to us about the electric bill). We also notice the kitchen light is off. So we look at the front door, and notice it is still locked (also, we never heard the deadbolt turn). We walk down the hall and check his mom's room; empty. 

So now we're both aware of what happened. We don't really acknowledge it, and as it's way past the time his mom is supposed to be back anyway, so we both just go to sleep. I mean, we were a couple of goth teenagers in a metal band, who cares if the house was haunted? At least now we're both pretty sure it's haunted by something harmless (to us, anyway). 

Next band practice, we tell the guys what happened. The guitarist laughs, while the vocalist and the chicks there were visibly shaken. So eventually the girls get so freaked out we leave the house. We lock up, and piss in his driveway before the long walk into town. Mr.guitar is saying there is ""no friggin way"" this house is haunted. At that moment, the outside light goes off for 2 seconds, then back on. This was no flicker or shutter, this was done by the switch. The switch is located in the basement, and 2 locked doors away from us. We all look at the guitarist. He only replies with ""Ok, so that was weird, but it doesn't prove anything. Fuck aren't we leaving anyway?"" So we left.

The last incident happened when another friend and I were waiting outside the house in question, waiting to pick Mr.drummer up. I look at his house, and notice that my friend's little sister is looking out at the car from his mom's bedroom. I waved. After 10 goddamn minutes my friend finally exits his house. We leave, and I mention that his sister was acting wicked creepy and staring at us out the window. He just says flatly ""She's wasn't there.""

7,A Night of Terror,1291179705,"Might not belong here, but i've always loved reading crazy trip reports. Some of them can be pretty creepy.

http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=39982

About a half hour later, the ceiling took on a weird gelatinous appearance, consistant with other reports. I then decided to get up, and listen to a little music. I didn't hear any distortion of the music, but I could hear my name being called over it. After turning off the music, I turned to see a black woman in a cape and a large fur hat sitting next to my roomate. She explained to me that he was very sick, and that she needed to heal him. She also told me not to be alarmed, so I turned back to the computer. This episode took about a half hour. 

At this point, the trip turned nasty. I can't explain why, although I believe it may be because the additional 5 pills hit my system. I am notorious for leaving dirty dishes around the room, and the light from my computer fell on one of them, but it wasn't normal. It was moving. On closer inspection, it was filled with thousands of clear baby spiders. I screamed, but it was only in my head, as my roomate didn't wake up. Looking away, I tried to focus on the computer. I felt something brush my foot, but didn't look down. However, I saw a flicker of movement near the edge of my desk. Slowly, what looked like a huge, furry pipecleaner rose of up from the edge. It then tensed itself, and pulled up a giant wolf spider, whose body was about the size of my head, with gigantic legs. Looking away, I could see 4 or 5 more of them, all running very fast, like cheetah speed, along the floor. Gritting my teeth, I slipped on my shoes, and ran quickly outside my room. I was in the main hall of my floor, where it was considerably brighter. ",nosleep,Cannabism,/r/nosleep/comments/eebgi/a_night_of_terror/
8,"My only ""encounter""",1291149465,"This is the only thing that's happened to me that plausibly could be a spirit encounter, another true story.

About 10 years ago, I made dinner for my brother (who lived with me) and my girlfriend. We ate mexican food, had 2 coronas each, and then went to bed.

A few hours later, I'm woken up by my girlfriend grabbing my arm as hard as she can, her fingernails biting into my skin. She's whispering in a desperate, terrified voice.

""Oh my god help there's someone in the room!!""

I looked around the dark room but couldn't see anything. ""What is it??""

""He's right there in the corner of the room! Help, do something!!""

I looked in the corner of the room she was staring at. Her eyes were wide with fright. She was staring at a chair with a bunch of laundry on it.

""Babe, you're just dreaming. Go back to sleep.""

""I'm NOT DREAMING!! He's right there!""

At this point I actually got a little spooked. I could tell she wasn't asleep. I asked her what it was. She said it was a man, standing in the corner of the room, and again insisted I should be able to see him. She was talking in desperate whispers, but obviously had there been a man there, he still would have heard her. I told her to close her eyes, which she did. I told her to take some deep breaths, and relax. Then I told her to open her eyes. She sat bolt upright and backed up to the head of the bed, trying to get further away from the figure she was seeing.

""HOLY SHIT HE'S STILL THERE! You don't see it??""

At this point she was in full panic mode, and I didn't know what to do. I told her to close her eyes again as I got up and turned on the light. She opened her eyes, and said it was gone. I turned off the light and got back into bed and consoled her. She was shaking, but calmed down quickly.

She was surprisingly back to sleep in a matter of 5-10 minutes, but I couldn't get back to sleep so easily. I was a little spooked by her insistence on seeing something, and the scratches she left in my arm still hurt. I finally fell asleep after maybe 30 minutes.

I awoke abruptly maybe an hour later to a feeling of intense fear and that something was just - *wrong*. When I opened my eyes, I saw - and felt - a presence above me, filling the entire room. It was dark, but I could very clearly make out what looked like a pitch black, wispy, tentacled creature, floating directly above me against the ceiling. It had dozens of thin tentacles which completely filled my large bedroom ceiling, undulating in many layers and each at least 10 feet long. Think Matrix sentinel, but with many more tentacles. It appeared to be made of smoke, or very thin dark silk.

It was just floating there, tentacles waving slightly as if in a breeze. It had a small head that was directly above my head, but no eyes or other features that I could make out. I had the definite sense that it was staring at me. The tentacles looked like they were made of joints, sort of like a bike chain. I was terrified.

I closed my eyes, I pinched myself, told myself I was just spooked by my girlfriend's experience. I was 100% lucid at this point. I squeezed my eyes shut very hard, slapped myself in the face, and opened my eyes. It was *still there*, just floating above me exactly as it had been before. I closed my eyes several more times, and each time I saw the entity again. Just floating there, watching me with its eyeless head.

I was terrified, and too scared to get up and try to turn on the light. Being a rational guy, I figured I was having some weird waking dream or hallucination, and didn't want to spook my girlfriend even further by waking her up. I closed my eyes, did some relaxation breathing, and finally got myself back to sleep.

The next morning I was making breakfast when my brother joined us in the kitchen. He said good morning, and then hesitated uneasily.

""Hey, did you guys... sleep OK last night?""

I immediately knew something was up. ""Dude tell me that you didn't see anything last night!""

He flipped out. ""Holy shit you saw it too?!""

""What did *you* see?""

He described very clearly seeing a woman, all dressed in white and shimmering slightly, walk out of his bathroom, through his room, and into the next room. He ran into the next room and there was nobody there.

I told him what we had seen. We all agreed that it must have been something in the food I cooked, or maybe insecticide residue on the limes, that caused hallucinations. We haven't talked about it since that day.",nosleep,allworkandnosleep,/r/nosleep/comments/ee36t/my_only_encounter/

11,"A ""lost"" SCP - a brief search didn't turn this one up on the Foundation's website, so I thought I'd post it here. Originally posted on /x/.",1291122303,"**Item #:** SCP-XXX

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-XXX is located on the campus of [REDACTED]. The doorway leading to SCP-XXX is constructed of reinforced steel with an electro-release lock mechanism. It has been disguised to resemble a janitorial closet consistent with the design of the building. The lock mechanism on the doorknob will not release unless # volts are applied in conjunction with counter-clockwise rotation of the key. The inside of the door is lined with 6 centimeters of industrial foam padding. 
Due to the results of the final exploration, (see document #XXX-IV) no personnel are permitted access to SCP-XXX.

**Description:**

SCP-XXX is an unlit platform staircase. Stairs descend on a 38 degree angle for 13 steps before reaching a semicircle platform of approximately 3 meters in diameter. Descent direction rotates 180 degrees at each platform. The design of SCP-XXX limits subjects to a visual range of approximately 1.5 flights. A light source is required for any subjects exploring SCP-XXX, as there are no lighting fixtures or windows present. Lighting sources brighter than 75 watts have shown to be ineffective, as SCP-XXX seems to absorb excess light.
Subjects report and audio recordings confirm the sound of a crying, pleading child estimated to be located approximately 200 meters below the initial platform. However, any attempts to descend the staircase have failed to bring subjects closer to the source. The depth of descent calculated from Exploration IV, the longest exploration, is shown to be far beyond both the possible structure of both the building and geological surroundings. At this time, it is unknown if SCP-XXX has an endpoint.

SCP-XXX has undergone four video recorded explorations by Class-D personnel. Each subject conducting an exploration has encountered SCP-XXX-1, which appears as face with no visible pupils, nostrils, or mouth. The nature of SCP-XXX-1 is entirely unclear, but it has been determined that it is not the source of the pleading. Subjects exhibit feelings of intense paranoia and fear when faced with SCP-XXX-1, but it is undetermined whether said feelings are abnormal or simply natural reactions. 

Authorized personnel may refer to documents #XXX-I through #XXX-IV for transcripts of Explorations I - IV.


**Addendum:**

Over a period of 2 weeks following Exploration IV, several members of the staff and students from the [REDACTED] campus reported knocking at a variable rate of 1-2 seconds per knock coming from the interior of SCP-XXX. The door leading to SCP-XXX has been fitted with 6 centimeter thick industrial padding. All reports of knocking have ceased.

**Document #XXX-I:** Exploration I

//D-8432 is a 43-year old caucasian male of average build and appearance and unremarkable psychological background. Class-D designation is a result of demotion due to mishandling SCP- ##. D-8432 is equipped with a 75 watt flood lamp with battery power capable of lasting 24 hours, a handheld camcorder fitted with a transmission stream, and an audio headset for communication with Dr. ##### at Control. 

D-8432 steps through doorway onto initial platform. Despite the wattage, the flood lamp only illuminates the first 9 steps. The second platform is not visible.//

**D-8432:** It's fucking dark.

**Dr. #####:** Is your flood lamp functioning properly?

There are no distinct markings, aside from nondescript patches of dust, dirt, or wear consistent with that which is found in a typical concrete stairwell. D-8432 rotates 180 degrees to begin descent down the second flight, then pauses.//

14,The Many,1291079410,"When I was a child, I saw monsters.

My family insisted they didn't really exist, despite my vivid descriptions and insistence. I suppose the creatures I described sounded like the typical child's boogeyman. Tall, emaciated, oily things that would come during the night and stare at me with faces warped in hateful expressions. The only difference between my monsters and the typical kid's nightmare was they never appeared in places like my closet or under my bed. Instead they would stand at my bedroom windows at night, twisting thin necks to find me trying to hide in whatever blind spot the windows might permit. I remember feeling sick to my stomach when I'd look around the room to find ugly faces holding open dark mouths, crowded around the windows. My parent's patience with my fear was stressed further because my resistance to keep the blinds shut. They believed I desired them to stay open, out of some irrational need for attention.

As comforting as it would seem to block their view, it only made it worse.. They would still come, always knowing which room I was in. Except if the blinds obscured their view of me they would whisper to each other. That was somehow more terrifying than being able to look up and see them in my windows. Even as a child you know that a stupid monster is preferable to one capably of talking, thinking, planning. Despite their regular visits, I never understood what they were, or what they wanted. Nevertheless, I always had the same feeling in my gut when they came. I felt trapped. I eventually stopped telling my family about them. They assumed I grew out of it. The fact was, they were no help. The only solace I found was when we moved to a larger home. I was able to secure a room on the second floor. One with a single window too high to press their faces against the glass to peer at me. The creatures didn't immediately stop showing up. The first few nights I could look out of the window and down at the treeline that bordered the boundaries of our new home and see several of them, gazing up at my window. I could only see their thin silhouettes, but it felt like like those thin forms burned with rage when they saw me. I believed it was because I was finally out of their reach, they stopped coming ever night. Even when they did reappear, it was never more than two or three.

I'm older now. Old enough that I can stay by myself while my parents go on vacation, drive myself to classes and work. Old enough to believe the monsters of my childhood are gone forever. Old enough to be careless. Even so careless I didn't even notice I wasn't the only one who came back home that afternoon.

This visit was different. They came inside the house this time. I saw one of them dash in my peripheral, running to a open room just behind me. They let me get upstairs and far away from any exit before they began to rejoice. Hushed voices with dry whispers of excitement. I think I understand why they came inside my house this time. After the years of being outside their reach, it was like a denying a thirsty man his water. It's only a matter of time before you drop your guard and he'll kill you just to take a drink. That had to be why my old childhood monsters came back.

Even now, I can hear them sliding around inside the walls. A door creaks open and I hear footsteps as their bare, damp feet make contact with the floor, dashing down the hall to another room. If I make any move like I'm heading outside, the entire house comes alive with the sounds of panic as dozens of those oily, thin bodies shuffle from their hiding places. I don't have the courage to make a break outside. So I sit here, unmoving, listening to the occasional thump from the attic, tapping in the walls, fast whispering.

It's strange, but it's not fear that consumes me right now. It's anguish that I'm their selected target. I've began to think it's because I know they're there. Like they enjoy enjoy the panic that follows their visits.. That's why I'm praying I won’t be the last person who sees these things. I hope that after you read this, you hear a tap at your window. I want you look out and see faces full of malice and hatred staring back. Keep the blinds shut tonight, you'd hear them whispering before you ever saw them, anyhow.",nosleep,KaiserInch,/r/nosleep/comments/edmw4/the_many/
15,What can dreams tell us?  Really... ,1291063279,"So I seem to read an awful lot of posts about people seeing / hearing / whatever in their dreams and then finding out at a later date that it correlated to something that happened or was about to happen.  These things happen to me and I have no way of explaining it.  
When I was a pre-teen I kept having a dream about a hospital waiting room.  I remember what the doctor looked like, I remembered where everyone in my family sat, I remember the pictures on the wall.  People were talking and crying but the dream was muted.  This dream recurred every night for a little over a week.... My dad was rushed to a hospital out of town that I'd never been to while I was away with my mom.  When we arrived we walked into THE waiting room and immediately my whole family sat in their seats as they did in the dream. I knew immediately he was going to die that day.
Another time I had a dream that showed a car crash with a white car.  I couldn't recognize the car but I knew the highway.  I just knew the car was white.  A week of recurrence followed by my best friend dying in a white car along the same stretch of road.  
I'm not a believer in psychics or anything like that and do not in any way feel like I have a ""gift"".  But I do find it strange that this continues to happen to me when someone I'm close to is about to die.  Now when I get these dreams I literally freak out b/c I know something is going to happen.

16,The scariest TV show I've never seen,1291061668,"Reading through nosleep reminded me of the scariest TV show I've never seen. It was described to me when I was maybe in college, and it still totally creeps me out whenever I think about it, more so than any other horror story I've ever seen or read. At this point (15+ years later) I can't even remember who told me it, or how much of the detail here has been filled in by own imagination.

It's supposedly an episode of the Twilight Zone, but I haven't been able to find a description of it. [This episode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mirror) vaguely resembles it but it's obviously not the same one. If anyone can ID this show, please let me know! (EDIT: found it, see comment below.)

Something ominous happens to a young man. He gets cursed, or somehow gets into some bad luck. Later on, he is looking into a mirror, and he sees a masked man, fairly far away, looking right at him and walking slowly towards him. I always pictured something like Scarecrow from Batman Begins, but wearing goggles, a big overcoat, and black gloves for some reason. The image I created in my mind still gives me goosebumps when I think about it.

The man spins around, but the masked man is nowhere to be seen. He turns back to the mirror, and again he sees the masked man, slightly closer this time and continuing to walk towards him.

The man gets spooked, and runs away from the mirror. Again, the masked man is nowhere to be seen in real life. He runs down a street, panicking. He stops in front of some sort of store, trying to get help, but the store is closed.

As he looks into the closed store door, over his shoulder in the door window's reflection, he sees the masked man again. Getting closer this time, and still approaching. It seems the masked man only gets closer to him when he is looking into a mirror.

He flees the scene, and runs to his house. He accidentally looks into a window or mirror, and again sees the masked man, now getting quite close to him. The masked man extends his arms, like he is intending to choke the man.

He freaks out, and starts trying to prevent this from happening. Maybe he covers up all his windows, or maybe he starts breaking them. Again he inadvertently sees the masked man through some sort of reflection, and the masked man is now just a few feet behind him. Again, there is nobody there when he turns around.

He goes to the kitchen to grab a knife to defend himself, but makes the mistake of looking at the knife, and can see the masked man getting even closer when he sees his reflection in the knife.

At this point, he basically goes crazy, and starts destroying all the mirrors in his house, while keeping his eyes shut. Due to having his eyes shut while ripping mirrors out of the wall, etc, he somehow trips and falls down his stairs amidst a pile of broken mirror.

He either semi-knocks himself out, or injures his spine, and is laying helpless at the base of the stairs. His eyes wide with horror, he looks around, maybe calls for help. As he does, his eyes fall on a small piece of broken mirror. In it, he sees the masked man's head directly over his shoulder, and the masked man's hands close around his neck.

18,"Creepy true story, house spirit",1291013541,"First, geez thanks nosleep. I discovered you tonight and now may not get to sleep :) So I'm sharing one of my creepy stories.

This is a 100% true story that happened to my mother and stepfather 4 years ago. They had just moved to a WWII-era house in an old neighborhood. My stepfather is a total blue-collar atheist skeptic (as am I). My mother is a new-agey believer in lots of stuff I think is silly, like fortune telling, psychic travel, etc.

After about a month in the house, my stepfather awakes one night to hear my mother talking to someone. ""Oh just get lost, we don't want you here!"" she is saying in a firm voice. He says ""who the hell are you talking to?"" And my mother says ""oh the old man, he's being a nuisance.""

My stepfather uncharacteristically freaks the *fuck* out.

""The old man, like a ghost?""

""Yeah but I think he'll leave soon.""

My stepfather freaks some more, and asks sheepishly, ""umm, is he Italian by any chance?""

""What? Yes he is, how do you know that?""

Turns out that since moving in, my stepfather had been having a near-nightly recurring dream about an old Italian man yelling at him and trying to strangle him in his sleep, but hadn't told my mother about it.

My mother, in her normal fashion, proceeded to chastise the thin air, aka the ghost, for being so mean to them. She told the ghost that he didn't need the house anymore and it was pointless to try to scare them because they weren't leaving.

My stepfather's dreams stopped, and my mother said she never saw the old man again.

But a few months after they had moved in, they decided to renovate their bedroom. They removed the old wallpaper from the wall, and when they did, they found a small metal box tucked into the brickwork in the wall.

They opened it, and found inside a few pieces of hair and an old black and white photograph of *the old man*. At least both of them swear it was the exact guy they had seen in the room / their dreams.

My mom actually hired some sort of holy man / exorcist after that to ""cleanse"" the room. Nothing further happened.",nosleep,allworkandnosleep,/r/nosleep/comments/ed7c1/creepy_true_story_house_spirit/
19,The Haunted Pub,1290990774,"So thrilled to find a place on reddit to share these experiences without being shouted down by those who figure they know all the answers about the Universe.

Lots of stories, but some of the freakiest things that happened were during the time I managed an Irish Pub (now closed) in St. Augustine, Florida.

As many may know, St. Augustine is touted as ""The Nation's Oldest City"", and although this is only semi-true, the place is ancient and absolutely loaded with unexplained phenomenon. I moved there to open a pub for a man for whom I'd previously worked. Since the gig was meant to be temporary, I was given lodging in the Monson Motor Lodge, on which property the pub was located. Although my life has been filled with paranormal encounters and high strangeness, it never occurred to me that the place may be haunted. 

I went straight to work hiring and training staff, and working seriously long hours. One night, after close, I sat at the bar with the bartender and a server, tossing down a pint or two of stout. The bartender was out of smokes, and out of luck, because neither the server nor I smoked. His last resort was a huge ashtray in the office that was full of butts.

Finally, the bartender got that desperate and announced that he was going to scavenge from the ashtray. The office was a small room at the back of the building, and had two doors; the first (which the bartender used) was accessible through the kitchen (to our right). The other door was at the far end of a large room, directly in our line of sight as we sat at the bar.

Seconds after the bartender had disappeared into the kitchen he came bursting through the second office door in a panic. ""Where did she go!?"" He shouted across the large room towards us. ""Who?"" we asked. ""The woman in the green dress"". We started to wonder what was in his drink as he frantically ran around the pub, looking for this woman. We had a clear shot to the door and assured him that he was the only one who had passed through it.

Once we got him calmed down, he explained that as he stepped into the office and turned on the light, he saw a woman in a green dress with a large hoop skirt going out through the other door. So certain was he of what he saw that he was too afraid to go back and complete his quest for cigarette butts. He made us go get the ashtray so that he could calm his nerves.

The next day, I relayed this experience to on of my servers, who said ""You do know this place is haunted, don't you?"" No, I hadn't even considered it. She asked me ""Have you ever gone into the bathroom and seen the paper towels unrolled?"" I said that I had seen this many times, and was often confused about who was doing it; since I always did a bathroom check at closing. Many times I would go in and find a huge pile of paper towels leading from the dispenser into the trash can below. Well, it wasn't a human prankster. She went on to describe that she had done an opening check one morning and when she entered the bathroom, not only was the pile of paper towels in the trash, but the lever on the dispenser was furiously going up and down, controlled by an unseen hand.

There was another girl who refused to go into the bathroom alone, because she heard the toilet paper dispenser in the other stall rattling loudly, when she was the only one in the room.

Although these incidents were curious and unsettling, the event that really terrified me took place in my hotel room. As a young woman living alone in a hotel, I was always a little uneasy about the usual things. 

One night, I had left the door cracked so that my cat could get back in after his evening stroll. I was lying in bed with no lights except the TV, when the other side of the bed gave way to what felt like the weight of a human. Although the weight was greater than my cat, (so great, that I actually rolled towards the indentation) I naturally assumed that he had jumped onto the bed, and made a mental note to cut down on his food portions. When I reached over to pet him, he was not there.

Finding this strange, I got up and turned on the light to see where he had gone. My cat was not in the room. I went to the door and called out for him. He always came running when called; and this time he trotted back from the far side of the parking lot. It was physically impossible for him to have jumped onto the bed, back down again and to have gone that far away in the time it took me to get up and go to the door. This left me with visions of an intruder who must have broken in and hidden under the bed in waiting for me to come home.

I finally got up enough nerve to look under the beds, only to find nothing. Realizing that I was sharing my room with an unseen tenant, I moved to the other bed and stayed up all night watching TV; too afraid to go to sleep. I moved out of that place as soon as I could.

**Edit for additional details:**
The Pub was called ""Lynch's"", and it was in the historic Monson Motor Lodge. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested on the steps of the Monson during a protest in June of 1964. Civil rights activists had staged a wade-in in the segregated swimming pool. The owner (who still owned the hotel when I worked there) was named Jimmy Brock. He had a fondness for me, because he had dated my second cousin in his youth. He was notorious for the photo shoot where he was shown pouring muriatic acid into the water with the bathers. He told me the story and said that it was staged. He swore that it was a muratic acid bottle (for treating pools) but the acid had been replaced by tap water. [Here is that historic photo.](http://www.drbronsontours.com/bronsonbrockcivilrights.html) As much as he liked me, I had a hard time remaining cordial to a man who still seemed to be unrepentant, if not amused by the whole disgusting incident.

The hotel maids told my staff that the place was haunted by a couple who were killed in a fire of the structure that stood in the location of the Pub's restrooms. The closest information that I could find was that there had been a fire; but I was unable to find record of anyone being killed there. Of course, a lot can happen over 400+ years; and I did not search the town's historical records. So, I guess it could have been true.

When the hotel was slated to be demolished, an archaeological dig took place. An abandoned well, containing various artifacts, was discovered beside the bathrooms and in the other side of the large room where the lady was seen by the bartender. [Here is a photo of that portion of the dig.](http://www.archaeology.org/image.php?page=0201/abstracts/jpegs/motel1.jpeg) The toilet pictured was the Men's, and the Women's (where the paper towels unraveled) was directly to the left of it. [Here are some additional pictures from the dig.](http://staugustine.com/gallery/monson_archaeological_dig/1.shtml)",nosleep,bugmonsters,/r/nosleep/comments/ed26l/the_haunted_pub/
20,Creepiest thing that ever happened to me in my own home.,1290985459,"It was suggested that I post this story here. I originally posted it in this [Ask Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eczjl/whats_the_strangest_thing_youve_found_in_your/).


I once lived in a secured, townhouse style apartment complex. I'd been planning on taking a vacation with my (now) ex, but in the weeks prior to the vacation, I started getting random hate mail. Things like pictures of rapists, with the words, ""You're next!"" on them, strange White Power brochures, and other weird crap that creeped me the fuck out. I didn't know anyone, I hadn't made enemies, it was just bizarre.

I went on vacation, and when I came back, I had more of this mail waiting for me. By this point, I was extremely unsettled. I had one more day off work, but my ex had to go in the day after we got back. He got up, and I slept in.

When I woke up, instead of using the upstairs bathroom like I usually did, I went downstairs, used that bathroom, and made coffee. In the kitchen, I found a trail of bloody cat footprints. I started to worry that one of my kitties had injured themselves, so I tracked them all down and checked them out. No injuries. I did find puddles of blood on the coffee table and a bookshelf.

WTF? I'm freaked out and paranoid, and I'm home alone. I called my ex, and he had no idea what was going on. I decided to just clean it up, and hope one of the cats had injured themselves but were okay.

A few hours later, I finally went upstairs to take a shower. In the bathroom were huge pools of blood, still wet. My bathroom looked like it had been used as a set for a horror movie. I'm pretty sure I screamed; I know I almost got sick.

I went to my apartment manager, and they had no good explanation. To this day, I'm still not sure what happened. The best guess I have is that a frog surfaced in the upstairs toilet and the cats massacred it, but I'm not positive.

Combined with the hate mail, that's the strangest situation I think I've ever come across in my own home.

34,The Forest Behind the Park,1290817113,"This happened less than two hours ago, and I'm still paranoid. I figured a place like this would appreciate the story.

So, I live in the southern part of North Carolina, near Charlotte. Compared to where I came from (Southern California) this place is a forest. There are trees everywhere, and there's even a small forest behind our apartment complex. Between this forest and our complex is a small, quarter-acre dog park. I have a dog, and as the day has been dreary and slightly rainy, I decide to take her out there after dark, since the clouds have broken temporarily and I have the time for it. 

The park is lit by a couple sodium-vapor lamps, but since I'm just letting her run around and playing a bit of fetch, that's enough light anyway. We spend roughly 30 to 45 minutes running around and burning off energy, and then I let her walk off to the other end to inspect the smells in the park and mark her territory or whatever.

At this point, I walk up to the fence in front of the forest, and stare off into space, lost in thought. In order to get a proper mental image, I'll describe how it is: the dog park has a low fence, roughly chest-height, that runs around its perimeter. On this particular side, there's about fifteen feet of grass as a buffer, then the first line of trees, short and wide, which normally act as a screen for the rest of the forest. Beyond this first line, the ground slopes down abruptly into the forest proper, probably about twenty feet lower than the top of the hill. Due to the time of year, almost all of the leaves have fallen off the trees, so you can easily see into the forest. It is from here that I first hear the rustling of leaves on the forest floor. There's a crunching like something walking around on four legs. This is, of course, not distressing, as animals in forests are to be expected. It sounds like the size of my dog, though, and I don't see her, so I figure she got out. The fence on the other side of the park can be pulled aside to let gardeners in, and very rarely, it is secured improperly, and dogs can slip out. Mo (my dog) is very good about not running out, but sometimes she gets too curious. I call her name.
""Mo?"" I call out, straining to see into the forest. The dim orange of the lights doesn't carry far into the trees, and the shadows cast by them makes it very difficult to discern anything. I do catch brief glimpses of something slipping between the shadows, but it's impossible to make out what it is. Meanwhile, the clouds have come back, and so has the sound of rain starting to sprinkle around me. I really don't want to get caught out in the rain, especially if I have to enter the forest to look for my dog at night, so I call her name again.

Suddenly, she's at my side, looking up at me. I'm relieved, but also curious as to what is out in the forest now. Whatever it is walks around again, and Mo's ears pick up and she turns to the forest as well, staring intently. Her nose twitches as she concentrates, and her hair stands on end. There's something nagging me in the back of my head, but I can't put my finger on it.

Then, there's something that sounds like hitting two small rocks together. *Crack, crack, crack*, repeating regularly every second or so, about twenty-five feet away. Both Mo and I stare into the trees, transfixed. I'm listening intently at the noise and trying to determine where it is and *what* it is. The noise continues for about half a minute, until it stops abruptly with one final crack that sounds more... wet than the other ones. Almost like a bone giving way or something. 

The nagging feeling has gotten stronger, and the hair on the back of my neck starts to rise. I'm feeling more uncomfortable by the second, but I can't explain why. Mo's generally a pretty quiet dog (unless she's playing with other dogs), but she lets out a little nervous growl.
""I agree,"" I say to her, and attach her leash and lead her out. I hear whatever it is, walking around again. I look down in the forest, and catch a glimpse of some strange looking brown-colored fur. The rain is starting to pick up more, and I'm feeling it land in my hair and on my shoulders through my jacket.

I won't forget this, though. Just as we're leaving, I look over my shoulder at the forest one more time, and I see a head in the shadows, looking back. Whatever it was, it was hunched over, looking around from behind a tree. I couldn't tell the shape of the creature entirely because of this, but I did see one eye that wasn't shrouded in darkness.

I was stunned to see a very human, pale gray eye looking at me. I felt the blood drain from my face upon seeing this.

I've never felt so uncomfortable as I hurried home; I felt like we were being followed the entire time. It also doesn't help that Mo is staring intently out the window, which is something that's unusual for her.

39,Caller Unknown.,1290748454,"This happened to me about 5 years ago whenever I was 16. It was a school night and I was dead asleep when my cell phone started ringing and woke me up. I looked at my cell phone to see who the hell was calling me at 2AM and it said ""unknown"". Curious, I picked up my cell phone and all I heard was wind as if someone was running full speed with their phone in their hands. I kept saying hello trying to get a response from the person at the other end but still just wind on the other end. After a few seconds of this I got a response that shook me to my core. It was a woman screaming my name at the top of her lungs; fearing for her life. ""TOMMY!!! TOMMY!!! HELP!!"" 

The first thing that came to my mind was my mother. My parents are divorced and my dad was the bread earner in the family so when they parted ways my mom always struggled to make ends meet. At the time she was working 3 jobs and one was at a casino. She would work very late at night so when I heard this woman screaming bloody mary I assumed it was her. ""Mom!! Mom!!"" I screamed back fearing the worse. Then the other end hung up. Panicking and scared that my mom is getting murdered I jumped out of my and ran to my dads room, crying at this point. I explained to him what happened and he somehow calmed me down and got me to go back to sleep.

The next day at school I asked everyone I knew if they prank called me the night before and all of them denied it. Which makes sense seeing that it was 2 in the morning on a school night. I got home from school that day and my dad tells me that he talked to my aunt (my moms sister) and she got a hold of my mom and that she was completely fine. So who called me? 

That same night I was laying in bed watching TV and my dad comes into my room to tell me that my great grandma (who ive never met or spoken to in my life) passed away...the same night and around the same time I got the phone call. Is it possible that my great grandma was trying to reach me after she passed away? And if so why was she screaming my name in terror? Maybe she was being dragged to hell and reached me from the other side in an attempt to save her. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/ebx4t/caller_unknown/

1st: A few years ago I went to a summer camp with a bunch of my friends. It was one of those older camps where everything is needlessly spread out with many footpaths going through the woods. About halfway through the week, my friend suggests we go exploring the camp at night. We all agree, thinking it will be fun to break a few rules and be creepers. So we wander around for a while, when suddeny we begin to hear a faint noise. We follow it to the dining hall, a massive empty building, kind of like a warehouse. We can tell that the sound is coming from the piano inside it. Around this time we begin to pick out the music better, it sounds like some of the most depressing music I have ever heard. Just a few notes, very minimalistic. We also begin to hear weeping, also coming from inside the dining hall. We creep up to the window and look inside. Its totally dark, no lights are on, except the dim glow of the exit sign. Using that as light, we can see a vague figure sitting at the piano, playing it softly. It is our camp director, sitting there, just crying like everything that ever mattered to him just died. And still playing the music, matching his mood. We left quietly, slowly walking back to our campsite. Leaving him, playing the piano, alone.

2nd: during the summer, a bunch of kids used to go over to the local elementary school and play manhunt around it. (I live in a pretty rural area, the school itself is about 200-300 feet long with plenty of dark corners to hide in) we mainly play manhunt there because of the playground, a huge mass of wood, making up mazes, tunnels, ect. It would always spread out, though to include the parking area and playing fields around it. (We couldn't actually get inside the school) After one very long game of manhunt there's only one person left to find, and everyone is looking for him. Some of the schools inside lights are alway on, and looking through the glass front door of the school, I can see a persons outline. Staring at me. I immediately though it was my friend, and yell out ""you idiot! Get out of there! We could get arrested for breaking in!"" The figure still stands there, watching. Everyone else, thinking I had caught him, came over, and saw the figure inside. We all are freaking out, not knowing what to do. One of my friends has the idea to call his cell phone, and tell him to GTFO quick. We hear the phone ringing (on the one we are calling with) and with growing fear realize the figure isn't reaching for his pocket to answer our call. You canot begin to imagine our total panic and fear as we hear my friends voice on the phone, asking ""did I win?"" The person holding the phone simply says ""yes"" and hangs up. We all suddenly realize that we have legs, and simply run, away from the dark figure in the doorway, watching us.

We kinda later figured out that it was the janitor watching us, but really, who stares out the window of a school, at 2 am, on a weekend?

54,/r/nosleep how about some OC? I had a very strange morning.,1290499885,"This is not a formulated tale designed to scare or inspire dread in the readers, but an account by me of the strange day I've had. Granted I am talking about what happened at around 8-9am this morning after I've been up all night. I've always had trouble keeping a normal sleep schedule. I blame the internet, and actually partially /r/nosleep in particular. I will note before hand, and almost meta-story that my roommates and I have maintained with varying levels of seriousness the label of haunted to our house since moving in. I thought while moving through the rooms before we signed to rent it, that there had been a young woman in blue jeans sitting in the comfy chair which came with the house, several times as I passed it in my peripheral sight. (my roommate keeps the chair in his room now) I say this to get it out of the way maybe spur some theories, I don't believe it ties into the story.

I will not pretend that my live the ideal anti-slacker life. This is a story of myself laying around, reading Slendy gags, and consistently revisiting the idea of tulpa creation in general. I am a writer by hobby and barely by trade in any real way (other than academic I suppose, since I guess I am going to school for English and philosophy.) I enjoy watching trends in literature from memes to creepy pasta. It all develops so fast on the internet, and surprisingly cohesively I will say while I'm taking a soap box moment before I get to my story.

Last night, I was in the midst of my lazy night with no reason to sleep routine. Reading Reddit, and googling for streams of shows I can remember I need to catch up on.  Mostly however I was trying to determine the number of Slendy series' and catch up on anything new I found. (I think they feed off of each other's narrative in a few subtle ways, enough to suggest co-writing perhaps or simply an impressive dedication to canon.) I don't mean to break form. But I am not telling a Slenderman story tonight, this is just a weird night/morning. I have had the lights off, illuminating my way to and from the room to occasionally piss. There is, for the sake of conveying a more precise visual, a trashcan behind the small couch beside my bed. around 4 or 5am I begin to hear rustling coming from the direction of the trashcan. It sounds to be, as though it's my roommate, whose room is on the otherside of a partition of sorts made from horse blankets nailed to hang in front of both sides of a doorless doorway(the roommate's room is make shifted from the back hallway/room of the house. we are three people in a two bedroom house by design, each with our own room.). Elaboration be damned, I think you get the picture. I thought it was my roommate cleaning his room perhaps. This is a valid idea I think to myself but,  I was well aware that I was the only one still awake until this new evidence came into light. A noise, from the other room. But, definitely not from my room. The smallish clatter repeated a couple of times again, each maybe 15 minutes or more from the last time. 

There are reasonable explanations for these noises, but nonetheless I found it very creepy, and it was starting to get very sleepy in my room. I contemplated going to bed, and shifted around my pillows, from the form of internet in-bed back support to what resembled either the top of a bed or at least a horizontal pile of bedding, rather than vertical. But then I began to hear a sound, like cutting knives through plastic water bottles, or two liters. Really fast, and a lot of it. I stared towards the edge of the couch, and towards the cloth barrier/trash bin area. But I can't see a thing in the dark. The noise stops before I think to shine my laptop towards it to see if there is anything there.  The light from the monitor barely illuminates the walls a faint shade of blue. the room is too big to be sufficiently lit by a laptop. Momentarily hesitant, I reason with myself... 'fuck it' essentially. I got up, took two  quick steps to the center of the room and tugged on the chain switch for the light on my ceiling fan to come on. There is nothing there. I decide it's probably a good time for a piss, and a snack. returning to bed (having been a little more careful to illuminate the rooms I traveled through than perhaps normally.) I sat in my bed, watched an episode of the Simpsons on Hulu and generally 'netted around until I heard my other roommate wake up. 

We decide to watch something funny on the internet and perhaps or perhaps not (depending on whose reading this) partaken in either the real or imaginary using of recreational pipe herbs of one nature or another. (hell maybe it was tobacco.) But either way, I begin to relax enough to consider going to bed. We aren't done watching the cartoons, when my eyelids start to get heavy. It is almost 8am now, and I'm almost starting to nod off in my seat. I'm looking towards the two windows (as the chair in which I sat, faced towards the outside wall of my roommate's room. The computer faced the same way, but you could see it comfortably from any seat if you sat right.) My eyes fell heavy several times, and as they would I would see in either window, something white shone through the heavy curtains. This is now in daylight mind you, and the curtains are the heavy sound-blocker kind (we have old neighbors, and loud music we had to find a way around that bad combo) The white object was either in the front facing window, or the side facing window towards their house. I must have seen the same thing, in no discernible pattern to it's placement 3 or 4 times, each time as my lids tried to shut from being too heavy. I got myself an ale-8 (regional decently caffeinated ginger soda).  I head back to my room and lay down, back to the window because something in me thinks that despite what may or may not have actually been seen outside those windows while I was nodding off earlier. I might be better not seeing if it did do something adverse towards me from the window, if I were going to sleep anyways. Laying my head on my pillow, I close my eyes. I hear beneath my head, a sound like something digging up through my mattress, moving about the size of space that a softball would take up. It just moves up suddenly and then stops. I don't know what to do, I'm so tired, and immediately a rush of thoughts on what it could be which wasn't any sort of bogeyman or haint. A small mammal, such as a cat or a rat... we have neither of those, and none have shown up in the house at all since we had last had a cat, months ago. There is however a groundhog under the house, and I thought perhaps with my ear to the mattress I heard, amplified sounds from below the house. This thought was reasonable enough for me to spend the two seconds it takes to black out when truly exhausted as I was.

I woke uncomfortably, and wondered into the living room where my roommate who I was hanging out with earlier in the day needed me to drive him to get some car papers or some sort that he needed in case he were to get pulled over. There is no need to go into detail with my roommate's property dealings or whatever, the point is we went out to drive up the road and back, very quickly. 

Getting into the car, we backed out onto the one way street we live on, and beside us are our two neighbors, the larger woman, holding the back of the smallish man's wheel chair. they are on the side of their porch opposite our house. I didn't think this was so weird, it was a nice day and in this day and age who has enough yard to stand in? However my roommate, who I hadn't mentioned any of the previous strange things too, He says 'That's weird, they've been doing that all day.' I asked if he meant 'not moving at all'. he told me 'pretty much'

This is when it really began to strike me as odd. I asked my roommate if they could have been wondering around the house when I was almost nodding off, before I went and slept some. He assured me that's not what he meant, in reference to them just being outside all day. that in fact they had been standing around looking all day.

We finish our drive, come home and go off to our separate corners of the house and go about a day of internet, and whatever business we had to take care of in that day. Nothing strange has really come up again today. But it is now 3:07am and I'm just starting to get tired again.

About a year and a half ago I got a new cell phone after it was clear that the one before it had finally been perma-lost. It wasn't anything special, just a red LG Chocolate that I got free with my plan. 

I'm not sure when exactly they showed up on my phone, but I'm sure they weren't there when it was new. At some point after I'd been using it awhile, two pictures turned up on my phone that I'm positive I didn't take. 

The first was of a room that I don't recognize and have never been in before. It looks like the floor of a busy bank taken from a second story mezzanine or something, almost like a security camera but with more vivid color. The floor below is crowded with people, all of whom except one have their back turned to the camera. In the right corner of the photo stood a woman (I think, anyway) with no eyes, nose, or mouth looking, if that's the right word, right at the camera. 

The second picture was just a very low resolution copy of some sort of leaflet, I could only make out the one-word headline: REPENT. I have no more idea where this came from than the photo. Unfortunately, awhile back my phone had an unscheduled bath of Vitamin Water when a bottle in my purse leaked all over the place and I lost all my pictures (including, much to my chagrin, a photo of me with Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero from The Room), and I thought you guys would appreciate this story more than /r/pics.

69,A creepy experience from when I was a child,1290285168,"Just found this subreddit and it reminded me of a weird thing that happened to me a while back.
A true story that happened to me when I was probably 7-8 years old.

Some background:
As a kid, I always had trouble sleeping and combined with my fear of the dark, my usual routine consisted of watching television in the living room until I would fall asleep.

One night I must have not been able to fall asleep at all, and before I knew it, it was 2 AM and I was watching Roseanne on Nick@Nite (Which would always start at 2 AM). As soon as the opening credits began I felt this sensation of someone being behind me.

The living room is designed in a way so, while watching television, I would be turned away from the front door (Which lead to an interior porch before leading outside). The door itself has glass through the center of it, so if anyone was outside it you could easily notice.
So I continued to have the feeling of being watched and I turned around. At first I saw nothing, and through the window on the door I could see stars and light coming from a lamp post on the street.

I felt slightly reassured and continued to watch Roseanne for another minute or two. 
The feeling quickly came back and I turned again. This time, I still couldn't make out much but I was not able to see light from the lamp post. There was something blocking the light from coming into view, some type of silhouette that I couldn't make out clearly but I knew was there. I didn't know what to make of it at the time, so I just stood there frozen, looking at the silhouette and trying to think if it was maybe there all along or something.

After what seemed like three minutes, the shadow moved slightly. I jumped up and at the same time the door began to open. I just stood there shaking in fear while a man started walking inside my house. He wasn't hesitant or slow and walked like he lived there.

Once he saw me, he drew closer. A coffee table was the only thing between us. He looked almost Eastern European, mid-40s with small wrinkles on his face. His eyes were open so far that it almost looked like he had no eyelids. He had a faint smile, reminding me of the smile Mona Lisa had.

He just stood there in front of me. He looked at the couch closest to him and laid down on it, facing toward the wall and went to sleep. I wanted to scream out for my parents but I couldn't. At the same time, I couldn't move and was just shacking so much, it felt like I was convulsing.

Then it just stopped, and my fear for him went away and I stopped shaking. I don't know why, but I turned off the television. I said goodnight to him and went in my mom and dad's bed to sleep for the night, which was regular routine due to my fear of the dark. I still don't know what came over me.

The next day I remember telling my parents about this, they didn't believe me for a while. Then my father found a belt on the ground that didn't belong to him. He was a little shocked about it and didn't really know what to make of it. That's the last I remember about the thoughts.

As time goes by it feels more and more of a dream that happened instead of a real event, but I still believe it happened.

Sorry if things are a little confusing, I'll try and explain things as best as I can remember.

Sometimes he's in a black cloak, swinging a scythe behind my unwitting mother. Sometimes he's quivering above my bed. My hands tremble as I ask, ""Father?"" He shakes his head no. I close my eyes and open them again, pretending I just woke up. 

Pretending the shadow isn't just playing along. 

Last night you were a black mass in the corner of my room. Faceless at first,in no hurry to reveal my terror. This is the first time you had features, however inconsistent they were. First the face of an ancient man, with  a straight mouth and sad eyes. Then you showed me your mask, filled with rose petals to hide the stench of the plague. The mask then became a snout, wet and bloody with inward teeth. 

I raise my arms, I know I'm dreaming now. I must have some sort of power over this. ""This is a dream!"" I try to convince him. This time he's done playing along. I'm paralyzed. The words are stolen from my throat and my hands are weighted to my side. The ceiling shoots up and the room stretches out. That's when he opens his snout, and begins to shriek. I wake up still trapped in stillness, still feeling the deep vibration of his screams ringing in my eardrums. 

Finally I take a deep breath, and try to ignore the burning of eyes from the dark corner of my room.

73,Paranoid?,1290209567,"The last couple of weeks have been hectic and stressful. My dad had heart surgery, and this happened last week while he was in the hospital. Mom was staying with my dad. I went to their house to feed their dogs, and my plan was to straighten the house and relax for a while. 

My parents live about 30 miles outside of a major city in a secluded rural area, just at the end of a dead-end 3.5 mile gravel road. There is one neighbor’s gate past their drive. It was an hour past dark when I pulled up. As I get to the driveway I notice a car is pulled up to the neighbor’s gate. The gate is closed, and they are just sitting. When I pulled into my parent’s drive, this car backed into my parent’s drive and sat there facing out.

My creep alarm was beginning to sound. I rather quickly unlocked the gate, pulled my car through, and locked myself inside. As I was locking the gate, the car pulled out of the drive toward the main road, as if it was going to leave. Okay, I thought, it’s leaving. See, you’re just paranoid, I told myself. The car went several feet past the drive and cut its lights off. 

My creep alarm went up two notches, but still I told myself I was just being paranoid. I assured myself that I was just stressed from the week’s happenings. The car was probably lost. Anyway, I was in the locked gate and just a quarter of a mile away from three huge dogs. As I pulled up to the house and the dogs greeted me, I felt better. 

I fed the dogs, and started to relax and calm down from the day at the hospital (and the unnerving incident at the gate.) As I cleaned, I started to chew myself out for being silly about the car at the gate, but still I didn’t feel right. 

Two hours pass as I go about my plans, doing laundry and vacuuming. However, I had an ever-intensifying sense that someone was watching me. While the dogs weren’t barking wildly which they do if someone comes up to the house, they *were* growling and looking in the general direction of the gate. 

I lived in that place for many years of my life, and I have never felt like that before. It has always been a peaceful, safe sanctuary, and this just wasn’t right. The dogs were still growling, and I still had that distinct feeling of being watched. 

I finished up around the house. I had to go home, but I really didn’t want to go to the gate. I really didn’t want to go to the gate without *something.*

The creep factor increased to the point where I got my mom’s handgun from her drawer. I thought it through, and decided against taking it. I wanted the pistol to be there for her if she needed it, so I put it back. I remembered my dad’s buck knife. He keeps it by his bed. I quickly grabbed it, and felt better about facing the gate armed. 

I locked up the house and rode toward the gate after my two and a half hour adventure in paranoia. As I drove I opened the buck so I could slip it into my pocket open and ready when I got out of the car. That way it would be no muss, no fuss if I actually needed the thing to defend myself. 

All the way up the drive I questioned myself: Why do I feel this way? It has to just be my nerves. I read too much Nosleep, I tell myself. I have never been freaked out about being “alone in the woods” before. I watch too many horror flicks. It has to be nerves. 

I got to the gate, and I hadn’t succeeded in calming myself down any whatsoever. I got out with the open buck in pocket, and I scoped out the path from the car to the gate. All clear. I opened the gate and pulled through. I jumped back out to reverse the process, keeping my back to the gate the entire time. I just couldn’t bring myself to place my back to the road. 

I quickly locked the gate. Then I ran back to the car, jumped in, and locked the doors. See? I told myself. You are just a nervous wreck because of Dad. I sighed, removed the knife from my pocket, closed it, and had a little chuckle at my own expense. 

I put the car in drive, and rounded the corner out of the driveway. The SECOND I pulled out, the same car popped its lights on and jumped forward. I felt I was going to be blocked in; fight or flight kicked in instantly. I stomped the accelerator on my old Camry, and to her credit she didn’t hesitate. Fortunately, I didn’t have to go too far off the side of the thorn-lined, one-lane road to get past the other car, but at that point I would have pushed the stalker car out of my way if I had needed to.    

The second I passed the car, it killed its lights. That sent my creep alarm off even more, so now I was a ball of solid adrenaline. I tore down the gravel road going about 60 m.p.h. 

There is no wireless signal on that road, so after I got to civilization I stopped and called the police. They sent a patrol car out, and by the time they got there no one was in sight. 

The next day when I came back, the lock and chain that fastens the gate had been moved around to the side opposite where I left it. Someone checked the lock. The heavy chain and Master lock had been physically moved to the other side of the post as if to make accessing the lock easier from the outside. Someone *had* wanted in.

But, maybe I'm just paranoid.

77,Creepy Smile,1290119516,"This is a story my mom told me about a house that we used to live in.  Was too young to remember any of this, but it still sends chills down my spine.  

When I was about 3 years old, we moved into a new house.  At the time my dad was traveling quite a bit for work.  So it was usually just my mom and my little brother in the house.  She would usually have trouble sleeping when my dad was gone.   

One night she woke up in the middle of the night needing to go to the bathroom.  While sitting there on the toilet, she noticed that there was a light coming from the heating vent.  In her tired state, she just thought she left the light on in the basement and went back to bed.  Remembering it the next morning, she realized that even if she had left the light on, there is no way it would show up in the vent.  The ducts just lead to the furnace and not open at all to the basement.  

Another night, she woke up and could tell there were all kinds of flashing lights outside.  The blinds were closed, but she could see the lights hitting the window.  At first she figured it was a cop or ambulance, but realized it couldn’t have been because there were green and yellow flashes along with the red and blue that you would expect from a cop car.  

Freaking out she got up to look out the window.  Just before she could move the blinds to peer out the window, she had an overwhelming feeling that she should not see whatever was going on outside.  Almost immediately, she felt herself being pulled back to bed.  Almost as if someone was rewinding her actions and she was moving backward in time.  

She woke up the next morning and called around to the neighbors.  No one knew anything about it.  There were no police reports or anything.  

Another night, a few days later, she woke up to the same lights outside her window.  Remembering how she was unable to open the blinds the last time, she went down the hallway toward the living room.  Sitting in an old wooden rocking chair in the middle of the room was a blond young man.  He just looked at her and smiled.  She started to scream at him to get out and leave her and her kids alone.  He just smiled and told her that “everything will be alright”.  She immediately felt the same reverse feeling drag her back down the hallway and into bed.  

A few weeks later, she was out shopping with me and my little brother.  She was walking along when she saw the same young man about 20 feet away from her.  He made eye contact, smiled, and went on his way.  

We moved out of state shortly after that…

79,Sharing a Story,1290104211,"When I was about 10, my family lived on an old farm. The farm was out in the middle of no where... On an Indian reservation (haha.....). We weren't country people or anything, my parents just decided they wanted to live on a farm for a few years. Anyways, the previous owners left a lot of stuff behind. The barn was filled with old tools, the drawers were filled with old papers, and every once in a while I'd find an old toy out in the fields. 

My parents worked a lot, so they hired a nanny to watch me, my two younger brothers, and my cousin who was staying with us while his dad found work. She was from Hawaii, as were we. She was also very superstitious and claimed she had encounters with the supernatural all the time. She wasn't really phased by it and kind of accepted it as a part of life. 

Another point to make, is that despite having a nanny, I was left home alone frequently. I was so afraid of this house, that I'd sit in the van and listen to music until someone came home, just so I wouldn't have to sit inside.

A lot of strange things happened at that house, but I'll share a few things. I remember everything pretty vividly.

-When we first moved in, I was getting ready for school early in the morning, while it was still dark. I looked out my foggy window and saw a face. It was a man, and he was starring at me. His face looked as if it were made out of a bush... I'm not sure how to describe it, but to me he just looked like a plant. I ran out of the room and didn't return for the rest of the day.

I was a pretty logical kid, so later that day I went outside to see if there were any bushes or trees I could have mistaken the man for. Obviously, there were none...

After seeing plant man, I almost never slept in my room again. Instead, I'd sleep on the floor of my Nanny's or brothers' rooms &gt;.&lt;.

-There was a light under the house that would randomly turn on for hours at a time. There was no consistency to the timing of this light being on, but it seemed that it would always go on as soon as someone brought it up.

-The barn was just creepy as fuck. My parents would send me out the barn which was like 300 ft. away to get stuff from our extra freezers all the time. They were just cruel and I'd always walk as slow as possible to the barn, then run full sprint all the way back.

-We had two dogs. One day one of the dogs went rogue and attacked one of my little brothers (he was maybe three? four?). My dad shot the dogs four times in the head and it would not die and would not let my brother go. My uncle ended up knocking the dog down with a 2x4, and was advised to chop its head off. For whatever reason, they decided to have our other dog put down.

Everyone ended up going to the ER, except for me and my cousin. We stayed home, and watched TV. I was really scared for my brother and did not really know what to do. When everyone got home, things were really somber and everyone went straight to bed. My cousin and I decided to fall asleep watching TV in the living room.

At some point in the night, someone turned off the TV for us, so  when I woke up at 3 or 4 the house was totally quiet, and quite dark - besides the light of the fireplace. I wiggled around, trying to get back to sleep, but wasn't really tired. I guess I decided to sit up, and when I the piano in the adjacent room was in full view.

On the bench of the piano, was a boy. He was wearing all blue, and was very... Grey looking. Freaked out, and almost paralyzed I started shaking my cousin. He woke up and saw the boy too. He's a little older than me, so he wasn't nearly as freaked out. We both starred at the boy, for what seemed like hours. Eventually, my cousin told me to just go back to sleep. I have no idea how, but I did.

To this day, my cousin confirms what I saw. Whenever I talk about it, I get extremely teary eyed. I've had him describe what he saw to me, and our descriptions are consistent. My cousin and I are polar oppisites, and haven't been close for a long time. I'm a nerdy, do well in school, etc.. He's 'gangster,' and makes a living off 'hustlin.' The guy has no reason to lie about this shit.

I saw the boy several more times as did other members of the household, but those memories aren't as clear as my first sighting. I have no idea if my parents were bullshitting me or not, but they said the previous owners had a son who died while playing with explosives or something.

The day after the incident and my brother's attack, they bagged up the dog's corpse and left it at the end of our 500 ft. driveway to be picked up by animal control or something. This was also where I got picked up by my school bus. Standing at the end of the street, next to the corpse of my dog for about a week sucked. I was so scared, I was afraid to even look at the bag - for fear it'd move.

-------------------------------------------------

Anyways, a bunch of paranormal stuff happened to me, right up until I was about 16. I decided that I didn't want any of it in my life. I forced myself to not believe, or be scared. In a short period of time, things stopped happening. I will probably share my other experiences in the comments. I love reading the stories on here, and felt it was my time to share. I apologize for errors and what not, but I'm a pharmacy student - not a writer :) !

80,Scariest night of my life,1290095041,"O Hai. I’ve been a lurker here for sometime now and I feel like I should contribute a story that happened to me a year ago. Also writing is not my forte so forgive me for the poor writing. 

Also to note, these sort of things almost never happens to me. I never had a scary experience before this. But it was just a freaky week....

---

It was a summer night in the middle of July and I was out with my friends. It was just another night where we spent it playing billiards. We got back fairly late around 2 AM and I realized I did not bring my house key with me.  My friend though only lived two blocks away so I figured I would just spend the night there. Upon getting to his house, I remembered that I still have my mom’s bus card from a trip downtown earlier that day and that she needed it to get to work every morning. I had two options: To wakeup at 7 in the morning and return the card or to drop it off in the mailbox. I chose the latter.

Seeing how I only lived two blocks away in a small suburban town, I declined my friend’s offer to drive me over. It would only take a few minutes and I would be back.  It was almost 3 AM by the time I actually left his house. There were a few streetlights on and not a car or human in sight. I usually walk this path every night because I often come home very late from my friend’s house. But this night was different. It felt different. Usually a car would pass by or some kids would wonder around late at night. But it was complete silence the whole walk back.

I finally arrived at my street. I was walking pretty fast now since the silence was getting on my nerves. I let out a big breathe of sigh as I reached my house. I opened up the mailbox and dropped the bus card in. Then I sent a text message to my mom for when she wakes up saying it was in the mailbox. While the text message was sending, I felt that someone was watching me. I turned quickly around and looked at the house across the street from mine.

There was a boy. A very pale boy wearing white with his arms folded across his chest. He was on the 2nd floor of the house. The window was wide open and even the bug screen has been pulled up. The boy was not moving and just stared at me. I had no idea how long he was standing there but I started to walk back to my friend’s house in a rush. I turned around. He has not moved but I can feel him staring me down.

I started to walk very quickly back to my friend’s house telling myself that that boy just couldn’t get any sleep and had to get some fresh air. But something bothered me. It was exactly 3 AM. Why would a young boy around the age of 8 be up at this time? And why would the bug screen be up? While asking myself these questions, a black cat appeared next to me. Now I am not a superstitious person, but I was already shaken up. Seeing the bright yellow eyes stare at me made my skin crawl and I quickened my pace.

I finally hit the main street with the streetlights and I started to walk normally again. Then out of nowhere, a car pulled out from another street. I turned around and saw it a few blocks behind me. I gave it no attention and kept on walking as cars would usually come down this street, as it is a very big street. But then I realized something was wrong. Very wrong.  The car never passed me. I heard the car behind me and its car light was on me. It was going along side me but slightly behind me so I could not see it from the corner of my eyes. My heartbeat started to pump really fast now. I was too afraid to look at the driver. By that time left, I had a block left to walk. I quickened the pace but the car also picked up speed to follow me. I told myself that if I heard anything strange or any sudden movement, I would run like hell. Then I realized my friend lives on a one-way street.

That was the checkpoint I had to make. The car could not turn up that street since it was one-way in the other direction. For what seemed like eternity, I made it to the street. I told myself that if the car actually turned up this street, I would make a run for it. I went up my friend’s street and out of the corner of my eye, I saw the car turning up that one-way street. I made a run for it. When I reached my friend’s house, I was banging on the door and screaming. I also noticed that the car has stopped at the intersection and whoever was in there was just watching me. My friend opened the door and I threw myself inside and locked the door. I then proceeded to tell him my story.  Then we peaked outside his window. The car was still there.

I went to sleep that night thinking about how I was being watched the whole time. Every time I thought I got away from something watching me, another thing popped up.  I did not sleep well that night.

The next morning, I came back home relieved the sun was out again. I met my sister later that day. She was close friend with that family that lived across from our house so I asked her about that boy. When I asked her, she had a very confused look on her face. She told me that that family does not have a son.

2 DAYS LATER:

I was pretty shaken up by this event but I dismissed it off as a chain of freaky coincidence in which I could not explain anything that happened. After a night of hanging out with the same friend and this other girl, we went back to his place. The same house that is two blocks away from mine. Again it was around 2 AM again when we got back and decided to watch a movie. I set up my laptop in their living room and after debating on what to watch, we decided to watch Fight Club. So the three of us sat in his living room on the sofa and watched the movie from my laptop. It was about 3 AM by the time the movie actually started. 
	
We were about 5 minutes into the movie when the house phone rang. My friend and I exchanged puzzled glances. It couldn’t have been for us since each one of us has a cell phone and he does not use his home phone. But his parents always sleep very early and he is an only child, so we had no idea who could be calling at this time. He figured though he should pick it up so it would not wake up his parents. He paused the movie and grabbed the phone. After a few seconds, he came back holding the phone with a confused look on his face. He said no one was the other line. Since he had caller ID, we checked the phone number and it did not match anything from our contact lists in any of our phone. The area code was not familiar as well. After a while of trying to figure out who it was, we gave up and decided to continue watching our movie.

My friend hit the spacebar to unpause the movie. Almost instantaneously, the house phone rang again. He had placed it on the couch next to us and it was ringing just as before. I paused the movie again as he grabbed the phone and checked the caller ID and it was a different number with another area code unknown to us. We decided to pick it up again. This time we heard a strange static on the other end. After about five seconds, the phone disconnected as if they hung up on the other side. As this point, my two friends and I were freaked out. We were wondering if the movie was causing this. Or could it be I was being watched again?

Being paranoid, I told him I just want to call it a night. We barely even started the movie and I have already seen it. But my friend wanted to finish it since he had never seen it before. After another five minutes of debating what to do, we decided to watch it again. We were all tense when my friend reached out to hit that spacebar. 

The movie was unpaused and the phone did not ring. We let out a sigh of relief. Almost right after we felt safe, the phone rang. We all jumped out of our seat and stared at the phone on the coach. My friend checked the caller ID for the third time. It was what we expected. Another phone number with a strange area code. I picked it up and heard someone breathing on the other end of the phone. Then that person hung up and all I heard was the dial tone. 

The porch light turns on. The light outside is motion sensored so it would turn on if someone is at the door. My friend and I quickly glanced at each other and ran toward the door which was about five feet away. I threw the door wide open while my friend picked up a metal pole he found next to the door. My friend is a fairly strong guy in the Army. He busted through the door holding the thick metal pole like a baseball bat. I followed him and we looked around. It was completely silence outside. Not a movement or light in sight. There is a flight of stairs we had to go down to get to the street. We looked around and there was no way anyone could have gotten away that fast. There was also nowhere to hide. 

We made our way back in. The girl was freaked out of her mind and she said she didn’t want to walk back to her house at this time. So we agreed to stay at his house for the night and to call it a night. I packed up my laptop in the living room and noticed how many windows there are connected to the porch. Someone could have been easily been watching us through the window while we were watching the movie. 

I hurried upstairs and the three of us just laid in his bed not saying a word.

90,It's Good to be Prepared,1289871556,"I enjoy driving. Most weekends will find me driving somewhere far from home to do exciting things, be they amusement parks, national forests, or casinos. Oftentimes, due to my busy schedule, I'll find myself driving back home late at night. Many times, I'll be taking wooded, country roads, as the sight of my headlights being the only source of light for miles is somehow...comforting. It's not uncommon for me to be so tired that I'll decide to sleep in my car. I keep a sleeping bag and various supplies (contacts case and solution, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc) in my car for those occasions. It's good to be prepared.

Last night found me driving down such a road, my headlights illuminating the overhanging trees as I passed by, their branches reaching towards like long slender fingers. Around midnight, I hit a spot of incredibly dense fog, my headlights unable to illuminate anything farther than 20 feet ahead of me. Suddenly I was hit by extreme fatigue and I could feel my eyelids pulling themselves shut. I decided it was time to make use of what I had in the back. I pulled over opened the back, lowered my rear seat, and began to make my bed for the night. As I was doing this, the fog continued to grow thicker and the animal inside me told me that I was not the only thing on the road. I shrugged it off as simply the superstitions that the lack of visibility at night tends to arouse in me. I quickly finished my preparations, shut my back door, and lay down to catch a few hours of sleep.

I awoke maybe an hour later to find that the fog had disappeared, leaving a clear night sky illuminated by the full moon. I stepped outside to take in the night scene. If you've never seen an isolated highway lit by the moon at night, it's incredible. The moonlight reflects off the asphalt allowing you to see perfectly without the aid of a flashlight and every sound you make echoes for miles around. As I stepped out of my car, I felt something, a shapeless force that called to me from the woods. I was unable to refuse. I keep a flashlight in my car just in case I might need it some night. It's good to be prepared.

I proceeded through the woods, drawn forward along an unseen path, my flashlight lighting the way. As I walked deeper into the forest, I began to notice tiny little spots of light that I seemed to surround me in every direction but the one I was walking. I at first thought they might be fireflies. But their pairing and relative stillness soon made it clear what they actually were. They were eyes and they were all watching me. Normally I would've been frightened by such a realization, but whatever drew me forward calmed me, telling me not to worry. Besides, I had my knife. It's good to be prepared.

I proceeded deeper into the woods, the eyes following my every move, the bodies I assumed they were attached to keeping just outside the illumination of my flashlight. I began to hear whisperings, incoherent at first, but clearer as I pressed on. Soon I entered a clearing and that's when I finally saw what had been pressing me forward. She was standing in the center, her back turned to me, her hair blowing in the soft night breeze. She was completely shrouded in black, as if she were a shadow, but illuminated by the full moon. As I walked closer, the voices grew louder and I began to make out what they were saying. They spoke of her. How they loved her, that they would do anything for her, that they would die for her if she but asked.

When I was within arms distance, she turned to face me. All of her face was shrouded in black. All except her eyes. They were perfectly outlined in bright, glistening gold light. She was beautiful. She reached out and hugged me, drawing me into her. I loved her, I would do anything for her, I would die for her if she but asked. 

I woke up in my car and finished the drive home, her voice softly singing to me the entire time. Even now she speaks to me. She tells me she loves me, that she wants us to be together for all eternity, that she knows of a place where we can. She tells me to get my knife. It's good to be prepared.

92,"Where I live, there is only one urban legend.",1289856200,"I live near Ridgewood, NJ. 

There is a man in Ridgewood. If you're visiting, late at night walk around for a while. The thing with Ridgewood is that the streets are long, up to a mile each. They are very poorly lit. 

Walk down one of those long streets. A man will walk down the sidewalk, towards you. He will be walking with a slightly hunched back. You won't see him on the street when you start walking. The first you will know of him is when he under by a streetlight. You'll find it weird that you didn't see him before.

When you come close to him, he will walk towards you down the sidewalk. You will notice that the man isn't walking on the sidewalk down towards where you came from. He is walking towards you. 

He looked, well, nondescript. He seemed to be in his sixties, but not *old.* He wore normal clothes, a jacket and slacks. What stood out was the tweed hat, the type that Jimmy wears in RDR.

He will stop when you're close to him, a few feet further than the normal talking distance. He will ask you if you want to play a game. Of the several people that have seen him, all of them felt compelled to answer politely. They felt that it would be very wrong to tell this man to fuck off.

Your answer doesn't matter. He will ask you, once, if you want to play a game. I said yes. He took out a coin. It was some sort of foreign coin for all I know. Not quite a nickel, but definitely not a quarter either or a half dollar. He flips it. You don't see the face of the coin. 

I won. He took out an old, beaten wallet. He pulls out a single. He hands it to you. He starts walking past you. I stood there for some time, at least twenty minutes. I watched the man carefully. He did not turn around, look over his shoulder or show any concern for me. In fact, I got the impression that his job was already done. As long as you play the dollar man's game, you will always win.

94,A comforting concept...,1289845032,"I have seen a lot of threads and or posts on /r/nosleep in regards to the concern that simply by thinking or dwelling upon such material will actually cause it to be drawn into reality.  Mostly this train of thought is directed towards ""The Slender Man"".

I wanted to draw your attention towards a mystical principal or practice if you weren't all aware of it already.  This idea is titled ""Tulpa"" or ""Thought Form"".  And yes, it really does mean that you all are making your horrors into reality.

[Read about it here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa)

I wil give you some famous examples of this concept in practice.

""When Alexandra David-Neel journeyed through Tibet, one of the many mystical techniques she studied was that of tulpa creation. A tulpa, according to traditional Tibetan doctrines, is an entity created by an act of imagination, rather like the fictional characters of a novelist, except that tulpas are not written down. David-Neel became so interested in the concept that she decided to try to create one.

The method involved was essentially intense concentration and visualization. David-Neel's tulpa began its existence as a plump, benign little monk, similar to Friar Tuck. It was at first entirely subjective, but gradually, with practice, she was able to visualize the tulpa out there, like an imaginary ghost flitting about the real world.

In time the vision grew in clarity and substance until it was indistinguishable from physical reality-a sort of self-induced hallucination. But the day came when the hallucination slipped from her conscious control. She discovered that the monk would appear from time to time when she had not willed it. Furthermore her friendly little figure was slimming down and taking on a distinctly sinister aspect.

Eventually her companions, who where unaware of the mental disciplines she was practicing, began to ask about the ""stranger"" who had turned up in their camp-a clear indication that a creature which was no more that solidified imagination had definite objective reality.

At this point, David-Neel decided things had gone too far and applied different lamaist techniques to reabsorb the creature into her own mind. The tulpa proved very unwilling to face destruction in this way so that the process took several weeks and left its creator exhausted.""

and

""Mr. G.H. Estabrooks in his book Hypnotism writes of his attempts to create a self-hypnotic pet polar bear. 

The technique of autosuggestion is difficult, but it can be mastered. Once the subject has obtained this mastery he will find that not only can he produce, say, hallucinations in the trance itself but can actually suggest posthypnotic hallucinations to himself. It does sound weird but it can be done. . . . Auto suggestion gives us an excellent device with which to study many strange things. The writer had a 'pet' polar bear which he was able to call up merely be counting to five. This animal would parade around the hospital ward in most convincing fashion, over and under the beds, kiss the nurses and bit the doctors. It was very curious to note how obedient he was to 'mental' commands, even jumping off a three story window on demand. But auto suggestion has a certain menace which this phantom bear illustrated. He became so familiar that he refused to go away. He would turn up in the most unexpected places and without being sent for. The writer was playing bridge one evening and almost through his hosts into hysterics by suddenly remarking, 'There's that damn bear again. I wish someone would shoot the beast.' He also had a nasty habit of turning up in dark corners at night, all very well when one realized he was just made of ghoststuff but rather hard on ones' nerves for all that. So he was banished and told never to return. It was fully a month before the writer felt quit sure that his ghostly form would not be grinning at him over the foot of his bed during a thunderstorm.""

Grant Morrison the comic book artist and wizard actually had his life affected by a similar concept.

Now, this is another comic book reference but it applies here.
It deals with the series Hellblazer and the main anti-hero John Constantine actually showing up to meet his creator Alan Moore (who is IRL a ceremonial magician.)

""Real-life Appearances
Interestingly, Alan Moore claims to have met his creation on two occasions. In 1993, he told Wizard Magazine:

""One day, I was in Westminster in London—this was after we had introduced the character—and I was sitting in a sandwich bar. All of a sudden, up the stairs came John Constantine. He was wearing the trenchcoat, a short cut—he looked—no, he didn't even look exactly like Sting. He looked exactly like John Constantine. He looked at me, stared me straight in the eyes, smiled, nodded almost conspiratorially, and then just walked off around the corner to the other part of the snack bar. 

""I sat there and thought, should I go around that corner and see if he is really there, or should I just eat my sandwich and leave? I opted for the latter; I thought it was the safest. I'm not making any claims to anything. I'm just saying that it happened. Strange little story.""

His second meeting with his creation was illustrated in 2001's Snakes and Ladders, an adaptation by Eddie Campbell of one of Moore's performance art pieces:

""Years later, in another place, he steps out of the dark and speaks to me. He whispers: 'I'll tell you the ultimate secret of magic. Any cunt could do it.'""

They met a third time in fiction, when Moore was written into issue 120 of Hellblazer by then-author Paul Jenkins. Moore is seen sitting in silhouette at the back of a bar as John Constantine (who is on a pub crawl with the reader) raises a drink to him.""

So, yes, you really are helping The Slender Man come to life.  And all of you collectively working on it will only make it happen faster.  You are also creating and feeding him with fear, a diet with some pretty intense implications.

1,Last night's adventures...,1289584736,"Ok.  Been a lurker on /nosleep for a while, but it's really just a guilty pleasure for me.  Never had any kind of ""experience"" with something I couldn't explain, although my parent's house is loud and weird and creepy.  But you can write all that stuff off.

Last night I was having a really hard time falling asleep.  Got up, had a scotch, and laid back down.  I was out within ten minutes (I love you, Johnnie Walker).  That's when the fun...or unfun...started.

My dog died in September.  She was the love of my life, and lately I've really been missing her.  So, imagine my surprise, as I look up and see her at the end of the bed where she usually slept.  ""Dreaming"", I say to myself, but take the time to enjoy the moment with her- to hold her and see her happy and healthy and not in pain was so nice.  I look away for a moment, and when I look back she's gone.  

But there's something else in her place.

It wasn't a mist, exactly, but it wasn't completely solid.  It was just...blue.  It looked like a man.  He was missing an arm, and looked really pissed off about it.  I could hear a conversation in what sounded like my hallway, and the blue man could hear it too because he kept tilting his head to hear parts of it.  Okay, still dreaming, right?  This is getting a little creepy.  Time to make myself wake up.

As I'm doing the wiggly fingers thing (try it sometime to wake yourself up) and I'm coming out of sleep, something very distinctly speaks in my ear ""AMELIA"".  Almost no one knows that's my name.  Everyone calls me Amy.  At this point, I knew I was awake.  I tap my husband on the shoulder and say ""Did you hear that?""  

""No"", he says.  ""But I saw the strangest blue outline of a man a second ago standing at the end of the bed.  I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to scare you.  I thought I was dreaming"".    ",nosleep,amy_two_shoes,/r/nosleep/comments/e58cs/last_nights_adventures/

16,Just looking for a little reassurance/similar stories...,1289352686,"I'll make it quick.

I don't believe in ghosts. I never have. 

My dad seems happier lately. So happy that i was able to approach him to ask him about it (without seeming weird). He looked at me in the most solemn face i've seen him make and tells me to sit down. He tells me about the male side of the family ""experiencing shadows"". What the fuck.
He went on to explain.
His grandfather would stare at the ceiling at night when he couldn't sleep. He'd see visible human shadows, almost staring down at him, but he realized their taciturnity. Being a more spiritual man than religious he accepted them until they left him alone.
My dad's dad began experiencing the same thing about two weeks later, he tells me. This time instead of taciturnity, they ""stood where they were"", occasionally moving their heads. Granted they were shadows, but it was still a visible head move he said. However, being as creepy as this sounds, they'd leave him be after he fell asleep. They eventually left him alone.
My dad told me of his ""shadows"". They'd stare down at him, the same as they would for his dad, except he felt the ""negative energy"". He'd wake up in a cold sweat. He'd hear screaming (in his dream of course). The door would be open (mom left him when i was 3). However, they left him eventually.
He has been happy like this for a week or so.

18,Is there something in my house? ,1289344321,"I like a good fright story and nosleep is a guilty pleasure. But now I wonder if it's getting into my head… 

I think there might be something in my house.  I'm a stout skeptic - and ghost and goblins really aren't in my list of Things That Likely Exist - but this is getting astoundingly creepy and I thought I'd share.   To top it off I work nights so usually get home around 2 and am awake till at least 3 or 4.  

A couple months ago the creepy old house next door to us was sold and knocked down.  It was one of those run down houses from the 50's that always had the drapes closed tight, insulation hanging out the eaves, and a lawn of scraggly dead grass and weeds.  We are glad to see it go. 

Roughly about that time we started getting what I could only call electromagnetic disturbances in our house.  Mostly in our bedroom at night.  For instance one night I was reading in the dark (on my ipad) and suddenly my wife's bedside lamp turned on full (it's a touch sensitive lamp with 3 way bulb.  So it takes three taps to turn it to full).  It was weird because we've had these lamps for over a year,  but I wrote it off to some stray flux or humidity or something that disturbed the circuit. 

Several night later my cell phone keep turning off and on (it was on it's charger).  I'd suddenly hear DROOIIIDDDD in the middle of the night and it would wake me up.   It's always been a glitchy phone so I wrote that off too.

Then it was quiet for a couple weeks.  At this point they had started pouring a foundation next door… and I'm starting to wonder if something got riled up. 

Now sometimes I would wake up with MY lamp turned on.   Sometimes her's would be on.   Watching TV in bed sometimes it would randomly shut off - or the satellite box would shut off (both on the same power strip, so it wasn't a power out) - or it would get these weird flurries of digital noise. But this could all be just random electronic glitches?

But then these noises start in the house.   Now we live in a very large city on a rather busy, albeit suburban, street.   There's constant street traffic, noisy neighbors, etc… I like to sleep with a fan on for the white noise.    So random noises are hard to pinpoint and you typically just write them all off. 

Most of our house is on the 2nd floor - only 2 guest rooms and the garage on the 1st floor.  Right outside our bedroom is a guest bath and then the stairs and then the living room.   We recently had hardwood installed, cheaply, and unfortunately the subfloor was a little loose at the top of the stairs and is creaky as hell.    It's hard to sneak out for midnight ice cream without making a racket.   I've learned to clumsily walk around the edges at night to avoid waking the wife up. 

So I'm lying in bed, in the dark, reading nosleep (naturally) and I just get this creepy feeling in my stomach.  And all of sudden I SWEAR I hear the floor outside our bedroom creak.   We don't have kids so we keep the door open and I glance over (my pillow is directly across from the door).  There's nothing there of course.  Just the empty living room, the glow of a LED on the TV, some streetlights making thin shadows across the wall.  And with /nosleep having creeped me out already I get up and shut the door.  Creeped out, but in a kinda fun way I guess.    Switched to /iama after that. 

Couple nights later I'm trying to fall asleep and more creaking.  This time it was several distinct noises, a partial second apart.  And if it didn't sound like footsteps I'll eat my hat.  DAMN FREAKY.  But could just be the house settling.  I'm sleeping on my side, away from the door, and trying to convince myself that ghosts in fact don't exist, refusing to turn over and look, and to eventually go to sleep. 

And then last night, which inspired me to finally write this down, I hear something out in the kitchen.  Kinda like the sound of a spoon being scraped along the tiles.  A tinny rasping.   And it's moving around.   That goes quiet, and I'm sitting in bed staring out into the living room scared shitless.  My wife is dead asleep and I'm tying to shake off the fright.   I eventually get up the nerve to slide out of bed and close the door.    Convinced as soon as I get near the door I'll see some black shape coming up the stairs or something awful.  Fuck me and my imagination.    About 10 minutes later the ceiling fan starts ticking - like it's been knocked off balance.  You know the sound: tick, tick, tick, tick.    I stand up on the bed and steady it.   This fan is rock solid normally.   Wife wakes up and is just staring at me, mumbles something, and I tell her to ""go back to sleep"" to which she says, very clearly,  ""I don't want to""  but then puts her head back down and shuts her eyes.  WTF!!!!??!?! 

I stayed up till dawn last night.   Nothing else happened.  But I'm thoroughly creeped out.

-Back Story-
I've ""had contact"" with spirits/demons/ghosts/principals that be from a young age; it started with sensing something that wasn't there to seeing shadows, slender figures, hearing voices, seeing items move in my room.  My earliest memory is of a girl named Edna that had lived in the house many, many, many years prior to my families moving in and that she was lonely and just wanted to find her mom.  Being 6 years old and not knowing of the super natural, naturally I told my mom about the little girl that would come into my room at my night wanting to find her mom.  My mother, being catholic, invited her priest over to bless the house and never once did I see Edna again.

As the years passed my experience with the supernatural progressed I sought out the assistance of someone who was skilled in that area of expertise and began I guess what you would call an apprenticeship.  I've witnessed exorcisms, poltergeist activity, haunted houses, haunted ships, demonic oppression, etc.

*EDIT* I'm going to bed - it's 11:28 aka the witches hour in which she's practicing making magic and I must go before something bad happens....

In all seriousness, I am going to bed now.  Mostly because I'm exhausted from the fact I encountered a real demon tonight - she gave birth to my husband and insists I call her mom and wouldn't leave my house tonight.  

For clarification, like I stated before and while I don't mind talking about mediums and demonologists and such, the main point I was trying to get across was that I wasn't asking you to believe in it or even consider me legit.

I merely wanted to offer some creepy stories of things that I've encountered.

23,How do I know if the time has changed if my computer does it for me? How do I know it doesn't change time from time to time just to fuck with me?,1289118894,"Tonight is the night when two becomes one.  Has time changed yet or not?  If it has, I missed it.  But if I missed it, has it?  There's no way of knowing which direction the hour's flowing.  Is this the new two or the old two?  Did I miss two entirely?  Back in the day we used to change clocks manually, wind them back an hour, forward an hour.  Two becomes one; one becomes two.  Now I just don't know what do.  
  
I don't trust the time shifter.  I mean my computer.  I think it changes time from time to time after time and time again.  I try to catch her in the act.  Clocking her minutes, counting them down with an hourglass.  Minute by minute, hour by hour, grain by grain.  But once I fall asleep I don't what she does.  And then I'll be late to work.  Or early.  Once I was late by an hour.  This other time I showed up a year before I worked there.  
  

  
Or maybe it's all in my head.  Maybe my head needs to fall back an hour.  Autumn up an hour.  I don't trust any of the clocks in the house.  I think they're all in on it.  Only the sands of time can I trust.  The curves of the hourglass remind me of a ballerina.  And now we both tiptoe around time.  So I shan't sleep.  I'll watch her face while she watches mine.  Together we tick.  
  

My late grandfather’s unreliable grandfather clock at the foot of the stairs—the only working (as in it still has a tick) clock in the whole house—reads a quarter till noon-thirty.  That puts the actual time somewhere between two and four in the morning, although one can never be too sure, as that poor, often mishandled clock isn’t consistent when it comes to measuring mistaken time.  The terrible timepiece once belonged to my mother’s father, an obsessive clockmaker who never had time for family.  For years it occupied the same space in his private office until he went mad and tried to tinker with his own internal clock, which he believed to be off by fractions of a second, but also that the discrepancy would grow and compound, like clocks that require calibration often do, and interfere with his life’s work; he feared it would render him, a man who had never been late a day in his life, unpunctual, and he just couldn’t have that.  The misguided tinkering left him paralytic and ruined a fine rug my mother had hoped to one day inherit.  Confined to a wheelchair for his short remainder of time on Earth, he could not speak except to announce the time, and he did so each hour on the hour, every single minute of every single day.  To this day my mother still shrieks when someone says the time.  
  

I never had the privilege of knowing my late punctual grandfather, which is a shame because I quite fancy clocks, and the deranged, and would have loved to watch him work, and maybe if I had gotten a chance to know him he wouldn’t have gone mad, or perhaps we could have gone mad together.  That would've been a lark.  
  
  
Is this how madness starts?  Is this what happened to my PAW PAW?

We're chasing a man on a motorcycle, and from behind I can tell he's dresses like a [greaser](http://torianmarket.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/greaser2.jpg) as we pull closer he turns and I see his face. It's just a [black void](http://imgur.com/Q5S6I.jpg), very wierd, as you can see from my quick photoshop. He had this black bubbles that moved around covering his face. 

The driver shoots this man in the face. He falls off his bike and takes off running. We meet up with other friends, one holding a stack of cash. The cash holder telling me he got it off the bubble faced guy when he fell off his bike. And bubble face had A LOT MORE! During this conversation a man in a suit came up to us, gave us more money and told us to forget what we saw here.

Fast-forward, we are in a hotel stalking bubble-face to steal more of his money. The whole time I'm contesting this. While in the hotel we're getting ready to sleep. As I fall asleep, in my dream, I notice a figure at the end of my bed. It's bubble face. staring at me as the black bubbles move around his face. For some reason I still go to sleep. Like he put me in a trance.

Now I'm dreaming *in a dream*. and it's just his terrible face flashing all over. First farther back then upclose. Just real shocking stuff with his oily black bubbles sliding all over his face.

Now I wake up, totally wake up from both dreams (it's 4:30 am). I'm in my room and  I'm looking at him in the flesh standing at the foot of my bed. I'm just staring at him. I start scanning my room and keeping him in my peripheral. But everywhere I look he's there. It was very surreal. I turn around and he's outside my window looking in. I turn back and he's in my doorway. I look next to me and he's kneeling next to my bed. Just looking at me.

After what seemed like 30 minutes, probably 1 minute, this illusion just stops...I can't sleep for another hour, constantly opening my eyes hoping to find him.

My bedroom was at the end of our upstairs hallway in the townhouse I lived in.  At the other end of the hallway was the bathroom.  My bed was placed so you could see down the hallway and into the bathroom from the bed.  I slept with the door open, and my mom would leave the bathroom light on for me because I was scared of the dark.

My mom always left the bathroom light on, but there would be times when she would forget and the hallway would be dark.  Whenever this would happen, something very strange would take place.  I would look into the hallway and see two shapes round the corner from where my mom's room and the staircase was, and they would begin walking towards my room.  They were like foggy, transparent silhouettes.  They weren't shadows - they were lighter in color.  One of them was as tall as a man, the other was small like a young child.

They would both walk, side by side, towards my room.  When they got to my door, the tall one would stop and the small one would come into my room.  I remember it walking slowly around my bed and stopping as it got next to me.  At this point, I would throw the covers over my head and not look out again until the morning.

Although my memory is foggy, I remember this happening multiple times, every time my mom forgot to turn the lights out.  ",nosleep,missingpiece,/r/nosleep/comments/e12ik/a_ghostly_memory_i_have_from_when_i_was_a_child/

You sit up in your bed, looking around in the darkness. There is a small light coming from the bottom of your door. 

You didn't leave the light on, did you?

You rub your eyes and there is no more light. You were just seeing things. Still thirsty, you get out of bed and begin walking towards the door. The first step brings a *creak* that makes your hair stand straight. Shake it off. You just need to get something to drink and get back to bed. 

You reach the door and open it up. Just as you thought: no light. You turn and begin heading down your stairs. Is there something behind you? No, of course not. Don't be ridiculous.

At the bottom of the stairs, you turn into your living room. At the other end is the kitchen. You're almost there. The window facing the street in front of your house catches your eye. You look out and see your street, lit with streetlights in their eerie rust colored glow. You look down your street, and the light at the very end immediately turns off.

That's nothing out of the ordinary, right? Lights go out all the time.

Why are you waiting? Get your drink and go back to sleep. You turn and head for the kitchen. You've just about forgotten about whoever *or whatever* was following you. Until now. Wait, you decided nothing was there. You're home alone. You know that for a fact. don't you? 

You get to the open doorway heading to the kitchen. This is easy. Reach in and turn the light on before you go in. Then you'll know its safe... not that you didn't already.. right?

We were 13 and 10 respectively, but out of the two of us, my sister was the braver one. Each time we visited our Oma's little cottage on the edge of the woods, she begged me to go with her and visit her ""imaginary friend"", dragging me along deep into the thick heart of the woods. Oma would just sit on the back porch and peer out into the darkness of it all, quietly and nervously rocking back and forth, awaiting our return. I'd follow my younger sister, Ana, closely, weaving through the dense trees, wondering where she'd lead me next. Our parents, psychologists of course,found it odd that she still had an imaginary friend at 10, but they humored her as kindhearted parents would. They said that eccentricity ran in our family, our Oma had the same bit of oddness that Ana had, and mother claimed to have it in her youth, but had grown out of it.

""You're the normal one, dear,"" she'd coo and tussle my hair.""Keep watch over your sister.""
So I followed her whenever she asked, being the protector I was trained to be. After a half hour of weaving through trees, she'd either lead us to a empty field or a cave and sit down, looking up into the sky, and begin talking quietly. I used to ask her who her imaginary friend was and she'd reply, ""Slim"" and nothing more. Before the sun would set, she'd hug the air and lead us out nonchalantly, back to Oma who would still be waiting outside.

""What did the trees have to say today?"" she'd ask each time we'd return, and Ana would fall silent; her cold grey eyes seemingly drilling holes into Oma.

""Nothing, Oma,"" I'd chirp,""Trees don't talk.""

""They do see us, child,"" she'd reply each time, staring down at Ana grimly. After a few awkward moments would pass, she'd change her grim facade into a smile and lead us inside for hot chocolate. Oma's house was adorned with cuckoo clocks from made from the trees of the Schwarzwald, the reminders of her childhood home. They'd all chime in synchrony, and the cacophony of sound was always a welcomed relief from the dead silence the house normally had. She'd tell us about her youth in Germany; how she used to play with her brother in the Schwarzwald.

""This big creature, mein schönes Enkel, chased my brother and I. It grew many arms and snatched my brother up! And I ran, mein Enkel, I ran and ran. That man never caught me,"" she tell us in a voice that was laced with nostalgia. We'd listen intently, with always with an air of humor. Oma never had a brother, we were told by our parents, so we knew the story couldn't be true.
As we grew older, we stopped playing in the woods. But every time we'd visit for a holiday, she'd tell us, ""The trees see us, our parents warned."" We'd humor her and agree, but often tried to change the subject. On my twentieth birthday, they put Oma in a home after she tried to burn down the forest outside of her home. I'd still visit, although Ana repelled the idea, but Oma was usually drugged up most of the time, blabbering incoherent nonsense when I arrived. On one of my final visits, she just stared out of the window in her room and said, very quietly,

""Death never seeks anyone. It waits in the woods.""

She died the next day. Only my parents were told how, and a closed-casket funeral was held. Neither Ana nor myself cried; I, for obvious reasons, restrained myself emotionally, but Ana just sat and stared straight forward. She looked more worried than sad, but her gazed never left that coffin. Mother was in tears as they led the coffin out to the graveyard, and after some pulling, Ana followed us out. As they filled the hole, I heard her mutter ""The trees see us..."" and she fell silent once more.

Ana's behavior became increasingly more erratic after Oma's death. She left the our parents' house and instead of moving into my apartment, stayed on the run. We heard from her in erratic bursts, such as telephone calls in the night just stating ""I'm still alive."" with a hang up before we could reply. The calls became less frequent, spreading out over weeks to months. The folks called it a phase and that it would pass soon enough. I figured they told themselves that so they wouldn't worry as much as they wanted to.

One autumn day, I received a package in my mailbox. It was wrapped in purple tape, but I knew it was Ana. After trying to get all the tape off for almost an hour, I got to the letter which was inside of a cuckoo clock that was inside a brown shipping box. The letter just said:

""The trees see us. Don't find me or HE'LL find you. Goodbye.""

54,The Bad Year: Things of Consequence...,1288733032,"Thirteen years ago, I lived in a house in a rural area. It was in a small town located about an hour's drive southeast of Seattle, WA. I was 12 at the time, and it was a very weird experience to me, as I grew up in the city. We only lived in this house for a year, and it was a dark year.

The house was located on a huge raked lot of about 3 acres. On the top of the hill, the landlord lived with her husband in a big house. The other house was located on the bottom of the hill. If I was standing in the driveway to my house, I could pinch the landlord's house between my thumb and forefinger to about the size of an M&amp;M, to give you a visual representation of distance. From the street, there was a short. steep incline, then the hill flattened out for about 600 feet, dipped down, along the whole property, like a big ditch, for about 15-20 feet, then began the uphill climb towards the landlord's house.

I mentioned before that it was a weird experience for me; I say this because of how dark it got at night. I watched a few choice movies when I was very young, which turned into a healthy fear of the dark that I still have to this day. But this was so black. Our carport had a line of very white bright fluorescent lights, and was open air, save for the roof. At night, looking out from the sliding glass doors in the back of the house, the cement carport floor shined brightly like alabaster, but along the edges, where it touched the other world, the *night* world, the absolute black darkness made the border fuzzy, the night creeping in, it seemed...

The house was a traditional rambler style. We used the back door mainly, because it was attached to the carport. When you enter the back sliding glass door, to your left, was the kitchen, past that, the dining room, there was a wall in between the kitchen and living room with a fireplace, so if you were to walk through the kitchen, the dining room, and the living room, you would end up back in front of the sliding glass door. To the right, was a hallway, first door on the left was my parent's room, second was mine, 3rd door, on the right, was the bathroom, and at the end of the hall, was a huge master bedroom and second bathroom whee my mom's sister was staying with us was located. These details are relatively inconsequential, save for the loop.

A number of...events happened here. I will list the significant ones here today...Ever since the first day I moved there, I noticed that at night, I was *very* uneasy. I have this super irrational fear of uncovered windows at night. I always I will see the alien form the cover of Communion, or something worse, like an old lady with black eyes or something....suffice it to say, when I needed something out o the kitchen at night, and the house was dark, I would carry my blanket with me and hold it up like a shield, blocking the UNCOVERED sliding glass door at night. (Hey...I was 12) (We kept the blinds off the door because we had 3 dogs, and they would always rustle them, and they would fall down, you know those long slat blinds for sliding glass doors? I hate em)..

The first thing of consequence happened one night I was home alone. I was being a little fat kid, eating nachos and ice cream, watching Rocko's modern life in the living room. Now, remember, if I am watching tv, I am facing the wall with the fireplace, so the kitchen is directly in front of me through the wall, dining room to my right, and entry way, with the sliding glass door, to my left. I decided I need another coca cola to put in my body, so I head to my left, as I round the corner, I almost choked on my own spit. Standing, on the brilliant alabaster-esque, carport floor, was a *very* big Doe (female deer). She was so close to the sliding glass door, she could have rested her forehead on it. She just stood there, the night world outside framing her soft, elegant frame. I remember distinctly that I could see her breath coming from her nostrils, and making little marks on the glass. Her big, dark, eyes were just staring, intently, straight ahead, not at me, into the entry way. I stood, pretty much frozen, waiting for something to happen...then, she didn't spook, or run, she just did a very minimal 180 degree turn, and trotted softly into the black.

The second thing of consequence that happened was during the day. The landlord had a rope swing up by her house, and let me and my friends play on it. It was a huge thick rope, with a gigantic knot in the end. One day, when we were done swinging, we were hanging around, enjoying that lazy, mid summer haze that happens just after noon; we were looking through the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition I had just gotten (that's porn, when you were 12 and before the internet caught on full throttle). The was a slight breeze, enough the sift the tips of the grass lightly, but nothing of any substance. All of the sudden, we hear a massive creak as the tree branch holding the rope swing bends down, just as the rope swing swings low and out, very far out, as if somebody, weighing at least 150 pound, ran, and took a flying leap and grabbed onto the swing. We watched, in disbeleif, as it swung back and forth, with equal momentum, for about 3 or 4 minutes....then gradually, it came to a rest...I am fuzzy as to what happened after this...

The third thing of consequence that happened was small, but notable, for later in this story... One day, my friend and I decided to dig a big hole. It sounded good at the time, so why the hell not? We went to the edge of the property, into the ditch are a I mentioned before, where the grass ended, and there was a rocky outcrop. I always though the ditch through the yard, now covered in the same uniform green grass as the rest of the lawn, sans the outcrop, looked like a tunnel that caved in...Anyway, we are digging down, we get to about 8 feet deep, 6 feet across, and we hit this old, old, brittle, thick milky plastic...parts of it are stained brown. Before we knew we hit it, our shovels broke through it, kicking up a huge cloud of thick, yellow, stinky sulfur...we stopped digging...

The fourth and final thing of consequence that happens was the one of the most frightening events of my life. This happened while my friend was spending the night. It was about 2:30 in the morning, we were watching zorro, and laughing, you know, being 12. All of the sudden, my friend goes quiet, and I look at him, and his eyes are wide, he is pale, and his hair was on end...I asked him what had happened? What was wrong? He said, nothing, it's too weird, you won't believe me...I shrugged it off, as I tend to do with things that scare me. About 15 minutes later, as we are watching tv, I catch something out of the corner of my eye, low to the ground...this is what I saw...for a split second, the only way my brain can put an image to what I saw, was half of a...face. What it looked like to me was a baby's skull (in rough shape), with a hole, literally, a hole, for an eye ( couldn't see it's other ""eye""). Stark white, and just peering around the corner. It was literally less than a second. When my eyes shifted to focus on it, I saw it... I *SAW* it quickly pull back behind the wall, towards my kitchen. I lept up and RAN around the opposite way through the dining room, nothing there...

I come and sit back down next to my friend...I looked at him squarely...and asked him what he saw...What he described to me was IDENTICAL to what I saw, from the hole eye, to the quick pull back, which was the most unsettling part....

I don't remember the rest of that night. 

I would see other things at night during the year we lived there, small, soft strobing lights in the trees, shadows flash across the bright carport at night, you know, generally unsettling things. I would also *always* hear shuffling footsteps on the carpet, people talking just outside of the light of the carport at night, etc...The dogs would get their hackles up and bark and growl at certain areas of the house...

Also during that year, my father began to drink, he, my mother, and I, were always fighting, I did horribly in school, got depressed and gained weight, etc. These were all very uncharacteristic for my family, and when we moved, all of these things disappeared. 

Years later, looked up the history of the property...that  ditch? It was a collapsed mineshaft, quite a few men died down there...

55,My dreams from yesterday night and last night..,1288727850,"Yesterday night I dreamt that me and Jarred were running away from something, not malicious or scary we just didn't want to be next to it, we had a few others with us but they disappeared before I grew conscious of the dream. So Jarred, Diana and I knew if we made it to the top of the tower the thing wouldnt be around us. Keep in mind I have this dream land where I occasionally go to, this tower was in it, so I was used to this tower, tower usually had stone floors, this time they were wood. Well we get to the top, and we are sitting in the middle resting when boom, Jarred falls through the floor, just like that, I couldn't catch him, Diana starts sliding down but im able to catch her, so I'm walking down the stairs (knowing I fixed the floor made Diana comfy whatever) and I wake up half way down.
 
Well last night I was at the bottom of the stairs and staring at Jarred's body, he fell like ten floors he wasn't going to live but I at least wanted to make sure cus well I love him and it is dream world people usually dont die in dream world. I see the thing coming, I grab his body I start towards the stairs when I realize, his body is where it was when it fell, I walked through his body, his body will not be moved, at least not by me, the thing reaches up, grabs Diana and throws her out the window. I am freaking out by this point so I grab at Jarred's body, thinking, if I can't move him perhaps I can move something of his and I could, his knife. I open it up and held it to my throat, stared at the thing, told it to go fuck itself and slit my throat open.
 
That's were I woke up.
 
This was all very realistic...We shall see where I get to go to tonight.

59,Hmmmm....,1288648233,"I work away during the week, and I stop in a large, Victorian house on a residential street.  Recently I've had the attic room, which is long, narrow and T shaped.  The two ends of the top bar of the T are double the width and double the length of a single bed.  The downstroke (which contains the door to the room) is about the same length, half as deep again.  

I use one of the 'ends' as it contains a desk and a bed, and a tiny bathroom.  The other 'end' just has a bed.  Only my end of the room is lit.  The only other thing to say is that there are half a dozen hatched set into the wall - all bolted on the room side.  I have no idea why they are are there, as they can only give out onto a wall void that is far too narrow to be a crawlspace.

Anyway, a very long scene set for a very short WTF.

I was sitting at the desk tonight, as described, on my laptop, when out of the corner of my eye I saw something in the middle of the area (in the downstroke) about 5 feet from where I was sitting.

Imagine holding a very large hanky (say at least four times the size of a mans hanky) by the centre and bouncing it up and down. THAT is exactly what I saw.  I didnt have time to look at it, but I saw it move across the entire range of my peripheral vision before vanishing.

There is nothing in the room that could cause a halucination like that.  The area where I saw it has a white wardrobe, and in front of that my dark towel draped over a turned-off pedastal fan.  There is nothing that could flap, and no draft to flap anything anyway.  The light is constant, and there are no environmental variables that I can see.

This is the fourth week I've stopped in this room, and have never experienced anything else.  Nor is there any sort of atmosphere.  Nor can I reproduce the effect by, for example, moving my head or my eyes.

Not VERY spooky Im afraid, but frankly Im at a loss as what it could possibly have been....

Any suggestions?

62,The strange occurrences in my old family home. ,1288635446,"I often visit my family home in the Philippines and find that I can never get a good nights sleep there. A lot of myths and urban legends in the Philippines involve ""duende"" which are little gnome like people who live in the walls of houses and in dark places and quiet alleys. I never really bought this, but strange things just seem to happen whenever I stay in this house.

1. The guest room faces the back alley and when I was a kid I was told never to go back there at night. I always assumed it was because there wasn't adequate lighting and there were a lot of pipes and garbage back there. My uncle would put a bowl of porridge back there every night and in the morning it was usually all gone, and the bowl would have these black smudge marks all over it. I always thought it was stray cats and dogs eating it, but one morning, there were 3 dead cats laying near the bowl. My uncle said that he just put out the normal porridge and that they 'must have gotten too close to the duende'. The dead cats didn't have any scratches or markings of a fight on them. The only thing that showed there was something wrong with them was that all of their eyes were taken out, including the eyelids. According to my cousin, this usually happens and dead rats, dogs and cats are found sporadically throughout the year with their eyes taken out in the back alley.

2. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and looking out the window into the back alley and seeing a small fire where the bowl of porridge would be and little shapes of little men sitting around it. I squinted to look, but one of them turned his head and I ducked down below my window sill and fell asleep on the floor. When I awoke, I thought it was all a dream, but I DID wake up on the floor, so who knows. 

3. These 'duende' are sometimes known to play with children and my little cousin would often talk to someone when she was alone in the nursery. Apparently I also did this when I was little and went so far as to describe a 'little man in white'. I don't have any recollection of this, though.

4. My grandma was in the kitchen once and she had a bowl of water to put some noodles in and  candle fell into the water and the wax hardened on the surface in the shape of a face. Apparently the face looked ""elven"" but this was a story my grandma told me and I don't know how much she is exaggerating.

5. This last one has nothing to do with duende, but it's pretty creepy. I remember sitting in the nursery and throwing my toys around and generally making quite a ruckus. I turn around and in the doorway is an older woman, dressed in all white. She tells me to hush and her eyes widen and she comes toward me. I blink and suddenly my mom is walking in wondering why I suddenly got so quiet...I never really went into the nursery as much after that. My cousins describe the same old lady.

**EDIT:** More from my Dad. He lived in a more rural setting while my Mom's area (where the above stories come from) is more urban. 

-Apparently, as a kid, they would play in this small irrigation stream and one time he was playing in the stream with my uncle and they thought they saw a small man further down the stream. They weren't quite sure who it was, and they live in the middle of no where so they pursued the guy. The little man stayed ahead of them just enough for them to be able to see his hat, which was white. Eventually, they got to a turn in the stream, and suddenly they couldn't see the little man again. What they did find at this bend in the stream was a child's clothes, torn up and bloodied. It couldn't really be explained because no children around there went missing and the clothes didn't belong to anyone they knew. 

-My dad was telling me a story about how he was sleeping one night and woke up to hear something banging on his rafters. He opened the rafters slightly and looked up and saw the bottom of a little mans feet as he scurried onto the roof of the house. In the trees across from his bedroom window, all he saw was red glowing eyes. He closed his rafters quickly and lit a candle. He opened them again and shone the candle out of his window. He swears that for a split second he saw 6 little men in the tree, and when his eyes fully focused the tree was completely empty. After this, he would try  to see them every night, and when he finally gave up and went to bed every night he said he would hear giggling coming from outside.

**EDIT 2:** I totally forgot about one my Dad has told me a thousand times. When I was a baby and we were visiting the Philippines, my Dad got in a motorcycle accident. He was apparently drunk (Yeah, young and in the Phils, my dad was stupid) and while he was crawling out of the ditch on the side of the road, he swore he felt something or someone heave him up onto the road. Once he was on the road, a passing family friend helped him to the hospital. The road was actually pretty raised and when he got to a clinic, they found that his leg and most of his rib bones were broken. He isn't actually sure how he got himself back onto the road but he thinks that someone or something helped him up. He says sometimes when he passes that spot, even today, he feels the need to stop and say thanks. He doesn't thank anything or anyone in particular, he just says his thanks and moves on. He says the feeling when he passes is something of an ""owing"" feeling. I'm not really sure what he means by that, though. 

**EDIT 3: This story is actually pretty famous in my family and has nothing to do with duende.**

In the Philippines the cemeteries are more like a collection of tombs and families have their own tomb where multiple generations are put. Each tomb is like a little stone building and you can go inside and pay your respects and leave flowers and stuff. The cemetery that my family is buried in is actually quite secluded and it isn't as large as other cemeteries.  Anyways, one time my Mom, Sister and two Aunts went to visit the family tomb to leave some new flowers and make sure everything was in order. When they were within our family tomb they started to hear someone crying. Not just regular sobbing to oneself, but the wailing you hear when a mother has lost her child. It was quite loud, and sounded like it was coming from the next tomb over. They go to the next tomb and plan to leave an extra bouquet of flowers for whoever is there but it's locked an no one is there. They look around to see who was crying but the whole cemetery is empty. A little creeped out, they walk back to the car and they all swear they could hear footfalls behind them, but every time they turned around there was no one there. So while they walked back to the car they kept saying ""tabi tabi po"" which pretty much means ""excuse us, we are just passing through"". It is said to pay respect to spirits and duende if you are walking near them. They got to the car, and as they expected before they got there, there were no other cars parked around the cemetery. They all jumped in the car and sped the hell home. They couldn't shake the feeling of ""being followed"" until they were quite far from the cemetery and well within the city. This also happened in broad daylight, and my sister, who isn't at all religious went to church later that day to get rid of that ""creepy, spine tingling feeling"". Part of me wishes I was there, and part of me is glad I only have to hear this story instead of experiencing it.

**ALRIGHT and one more. End this on a much, much lighter note**

In the Philippines it is believed that butterflies can contain a deceased soul or even signal death. A couple years ago, my uncle died of lung cancer and for 40 days after his death a black butterfly would flutter in and out of the kitchen around the time he would be cooking dinner and washing dishes. I wasn't in the Philippines during this time, but if I saw that butterfly I would have been like ""Waddap Tito!"".",nosleep,Autotrappic,/r/nosleep/comments/dzm50/the_strange_occurrences_in_my_old_family_home/

72,Follow up on the strange happenings in my apartment. ,1288462239,"So last night I went to my parents' house to say hi on the way to my eye doctor (I've been getting headaches...tuns out my perscription was too strong).  I decided to go through my room and see if there was anything left behind when I moved out.  I found my digital voice recorder, a few proof sets, and a nearly complete car of Jefferson nickels (my uncle and I used to collect coins).  I also grabbed my dvd player since Katie's stopped working mysteriously.

When I got home from the doctor and dinner, we went to the bar to watch my Blackhawks get stomped by the Edmonton Oilers.  Not very happy about that but we can't win them all.  Anywho, after a few hours that were best not recorded, I decided to see if i could catch anything on the DVR.  I set it up in the bathroom, where we have been hearing the noises recently.  Things like the shower curtain opening and closing, marbles being dropped into the tub, and whispers.

We closed the door (so the cat couldn't get in there and mess with our experiment and also moved her food and water into our bedroom so she would be less tempted to go exploring in the middle of the night.  After a really awesome (drunk) introduction, I set the recorder on the edge of the bathtub, hoping the tub would act as a resonator.  It was set to record for 8 hours and some change and Katie and I went to bed.

This morning, I woke up and completely forgot about the recorder.  I went to the bathroom and brushed my teeth and noticed I had left it on the edge of the tub.  I grabbed it, took it to the computer and plugged it in.  I loaded up audacity to see if there was anything worth listening to (8 and a half hours is a lot of white noise if you don't see a starting place).

I noticed every half hour there was a spike in the audio.  I highlighted one of them and it turned out to be the automatic air freshener doing its job.  I almost gave up on the whole thing until I noticed this: http://imgur.com/iVDwC.jpg

In the first circle you can see the ""click"" I was talking about.  But shortly after that, there is a sound that I can only describe as something or someone saying ""shh.""  This was about 4 hours into the recording putting it at around 3am.  I am trying to find a audio hosting service so you can listen for yourselves.  If you have any ideas, let me know in the comments.

75,Basement Laundry Room,1288411805,"So, I've been reading this subreddit for a while and I feel that it's probably time for me to tell my personal story of what I've experienced. I can't say this experience has made me believe in ghosts, but, it's definitely something I can't explain.

This happened back when I was in HS when I used to live in New Jersey. We had a half finished basement with very cold concrete floors, my dad never finished putting a layer of carpet after he coated the concrete with a moisture barrier. In the basement, we had a laundry room that was half finished as well. The rooms light switch were outside, but in the middle of the laundry room itself, there was a light bulb attached to a string. I have no idea why that was there, since there are already pendant lighting fixtures hooked up to the switch, but whatever. 

So one night, I was down in the basement hanging up my laundry to dry, when all of a sudden, out of no where, I heard a click sound and that light bulb turned on. At that moment the hairs on my skin rose. I turned around and I saw the string dangling. Now, maybe my back brushed against the string and caused it to swing, but there was no way that my back could have pulled on that string to turn on that light. After being in that room and trying to logically piece together what the hell just happened, I realized that I just needed to get the fuck out of there, FAST.

I honestly ran screaming up two flights of stairs back up to the second floor where my parents where, screaming and yelling. My parents were like WTF is wrong with you? I told them that I was doing laundry and all of a sudden, that fucking light bulb just went off by itself. And all my dad could say was, ""what? that light is still on? you better go back downstairs to turn it off, you're wasting electricity"".

To this day I when I have nightmares, they sometimes take place in that basement, that place still freaks me out.",nosleep,maxwellimus,/r/nosleep/comments/dykn9/basement_laundry_room/
76,Wake Up (A True Story),1288389385,"When I was around 18 or so, I had been living in a hotel with my mother and sister. We had lost most of our house to a fire 2 years prior and had been living at a Extended Stay temporaily. We chose this particular hotel because of it's location. It was rather close to our school and where my mother worked at the time, so it seemed like the right choice. Now, what makes the location so interesting is the fact that it's located in the Meadowlands. Famous for housing Giants Stadium (now Meadowlands Stadium).

For those of you who aren't so familar with the setting, the Meadowlands are mostly swamps and marsh fields. Way back when, before redevelopment on the area began, it was mostly pig farms. So it was safe to say, that if you were up to no good and needed something to get rid of, you went here. Hazardous materials, broken down vehicles, even bodies were left to rot in the murky waters of the various swamps. Mostly considered to be the perfect place for murders and rapes. It's even rumored that Al Capone's bodied is buried somewhere out there. So, with that little bit of back history, I now continue on with my own little tale.

I had woken up from seemed like a average dream, gasping for air. The inhales loud enough to wake my mother up who slept in the bed beside me. After a few minutes, I finally regained my composure. I couldn't figure it out but I had stopped breathing. My mother turns to me and asks if I was alright. I reassure her that everything is fine and tell her to go back to bed. At this point I'm wide awake but decide that I need to go back to sleep since it was rather late and I had class the next day.

I lay my head back onto the pillow, and as soon as I feel the cold fabric touch the back of my head I felt something else that I would never forget. The unmistakable touch of a finger tapping on my forehead. Two quicks taps. It came fast and felt harsh. I quickly rose and scanned the area and saw nothing. My mother and sister were laying down, sleeping. No one else by us three in the room. I begin to freak out and turn on all the lights. Waking up my family, they ask me whats wrong. I explain the story to them but they write it off as a dream. My mother had seemed to have forgotten already that she had already woken up by my odd gasps for air. 

For the rest of the night, I sat up leaning across the bed frame observing the room until my body couldn't take it anymore. It was too exhausted. From lack of sleep and a shock to the system that occured twice in one night, it was ready for bed. But as I sat there, dosing off into a sleep my body was screaming for, I couldn't shake the feeling that something wanted my attention.

81,Few more stories,1288361292,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dtzdb/the_walk_home/) is the first story.  Here are three more.  These were all related by my maternal grandmother.  

1 - A bunch of her friends were playing leapfrog one day in an open community courtyard when a new kid appeared and asked if he could join in.  Everyone gladly said yes and started taking turns.  However, when this kid took his turn and jumped over the in front of him, he got up and told everyone he had to leave.  Everyone ignored it at first, but the kid would come back every so often when they were playing leapfrog and always leave before anyone could leap over him.  So one day, one of my grandmother's friends got fed up and said ""no, you can't leave.  You always take your turn and leave.  We HAVE to take our turn now.""  The kid initially pleaded to go, but eventually shrugged and told them fine; they could have their turn.

Doesn't his turn come up to get leaped over when he lands and all of a sudden his arms start stretching longer and longer for the next person to leap over.  Suffice it to say all my grandmother's friends ran home fast.

2 - Just a quick one my grandmother told me about some temple she lived near when she was young.  The village she lived in was not all that large and was mostly surrounded by farmland.  The temple near them had some kind of large bell or gong and you would hear it going off from time to time.  She told us that from time to time if you looked for the person ringing the bell your stare would be met by this horribly huge eye looking back at you embedded in the headless and bleeding neck of a man.  

3 - This one I can't remember how it related to my grandmother (maybe something she had heard herself) but she told us how once there was a wedding in a village and after a very festive ceremony everyone was getting packed up to leave late at night.  At this time, we're talking about horse drawn carriages and the like, so no quick forms of transport.  The last of the guests were now packed up and leaving when all of a sudden from the corner of their eyes someone noticed something moving towards them from the wedding grounds.  They slowed the carriage to better make out what might be.

A large piece of, as my grandmother described it, ""meat"" was lumbering up behind them and was now following them.  The carriage booked it out of there as fast as it could.

-------

Just another story to add: my cousin and I were talking about all this stuff recently when he told me that his wife, who is in Pakistan at the moment, just had something creepy happen near her.  Apparently she had woken up in the middle of the night to the sounds of a woman's screams coming from the house diagonally behind theirs.  Now they live in a pretty busy area of Karachi so it's not pitch dark or empty at any time.  Always people bustling around and stuff happening at all times of the day.  Additionally it was a neighbor they knew so my cousin's wife got a bit worried but at the same time thought she might have just imagined hearing something and went back to sleep. 

The next morning, my aunt who lives across from where my cousin's wife is staying tells her to come to their neighbor's place.  My aunt had heard the screams (more than one) too and wanted to find out what had happened.

When they talked to their neighbors, they found out that late that night her daughter came screaming into her room about a knife simply floating in the air.  The mother went to check it out and found not only the knife, but a pair of scissors floating along with the knife and either fighting each other or sharpening themselves against each other.  That was the second scream.  I don't think they stayed in that house that night.  

Apparently someone told them they had inadvertently invited in jinn to their house and now they would had to be evicted.  

Funny ending though: my cousin told me in the end apparently even though the neighbors were too scared to stay in the house, **their** grandmother decided **she** would personally stay alone in the house to get rid of the jinn.  Apparently it worked.

tl;dr: when creepy stuff is going on, who you gonna call?  Your grandmother.",nosleep,mansoorz,/r/nosleep/comments/dy8vv/few_more_stories/

83,Tailgate,1288343376,"I was driving down the 495 (LIE), it was 4am EST. I've become accustomed to these long, dark, empty drives--they've become something of a pillar in my life, an hour of solid alone time to think about things.

I was passing exit 51, when a single light appeared over the back horizon. It was rather far back, I assumed a motorcyclist on his way home.

On my drive home, I like to listen to NPR. It's generally a quiet station, and it helps me feel properly alone. Around exit 55, I lose reception on one NPR station, and gain reception on the other around exit 49. This, too, has become a regular part of my day.

Tonight was no different. Exits 55 throug 49 were accompanied by their usual between-station white noise.

The light grew closer, and I noticed it was not a motorcycle, but rather a car with a missing headlight. It grew slowly closer.

Normally, I would slow down, and allow the car to pass me at its own pace, making the road around me alone again. When I slowed down, the car behind me appeared to slow as well. It grew even closer.

Soon, the car was right behind me. It's single headlight was shining in my rearview, blinding me momentarily. It was at this time I noticed a strange pulsing in the radio noise. Not quite like a heartbeat, but rather like the knocking of a door.

Trying to frustrate his tailgaiting, I slowed my pace to 35 mph, but the single headlight persisted. I sped to 75, but the headlight remained consistently close behind me. I shifted lanes in various directions, but still the light followed.

I got off the highway at exit 41, but the radio hadn't returned, only the pulsing knock. The headlight still remained.

As I got closer to home, I began to dodge and weave quickly through the small, curving, suburban roads. Soon, I lost the mysterious single-light car.

I pulled into my driveway, and quickly scurried inside, and locked the door behind me. I put water on the stove to make a cup of Chamomile, when I peaked out the window.

84,An encounter with some Jinn,1288339194,"My wife related this story to me when I prompted her for one of the creepiest things that'd ever happened to her. True story.


A couple of years before we got married, she went with her parents and a couple of aunts to Mecca to perform the haj pilgrimage. At the hotel they were staying in were several families from from Mozambique, several of whom were known to my wife's family. The daughter of one of these families, who was about 22 and married, was just staying in her room and not performing any of the haj rituals, and not performing any prayers at all (I'm not going to go into the details of the haj—if you're really interested, hit up Wikipedia. It's anciliary to the event anyhow.)


The desperate parents of this young woman spoke to the owners of the hotel, and they got hold of someone who got hold of this old indian wise man, who comes by the hotel. All of what happens next takes place in the hotel foyer, and can be corroborated by my wife's parents and aunts. The old guy comes in, and without any questions or preamble says to the hotel owner ""There's a woman staying in the hotel by the name of..."" He gives details about a girl of about 18 or 20, and it's confirmed that there *is* such a person staying at the hotel. Whether he found out somehow, or just KNEW is left for debate.


""Bring her and her parents here,"" he tells them. So the bewildered young girl and her bewildered parents come down to the foyer. Turns out the family are from Mozambique, and the only language the girl speaks is Portuguese (this is common in Mozambique, apparently). No matter, apparently. I'm not sure if he used an interpreter here, but he pulls this girl aside (we'll call her Girl A for expediency's sake), and has a chat with her. Apparently, she had been going out with this guy back home, and his mom was having trouble accepting her. One of the reasons she'd come on this pilgrimage was to find the peace within herself to accept whatever answer came from the guy. Anyhow, the old guru tells her, ""I know about what's happening back home, and I want you to know that the young man you want to marry is putting his foot down and telling his mother that you're the one he wants to settle down with. I'm telling you this because I need your mind at peace."" Once again, no idea how he knew all this, because the first time any of these people saw him is when he came striding into the hotel.


Girl A seems happy, and agrees to work with the guy. According to the guru, Girl A is somehow susceptible to being possessed by jinn--and that's a scary enough thought for me. So he sits her down in front of the troubled young woman (we'll call her T), and starts reciting something in Arabic. Girl A closes her eyes for a short bit while this guy is reciting, and suddenly she starts having what looks like an epileptic fit, and obviously her parents are freaking out. Suddenly she stops and sits back.


Old guy says, in Urdu, ""Can you hear me?"" Girl A, in a very distinct MALE voice, says in perfect Urdu, ""Yes."" Bear in mind that the only language she knows is Portuguese, so the fact that she's now talking in Urdu is something else *entirely*.


He then says, ""Can you see what's stopping Girl T from performing her haj?""


Girl A, in this man's voice, says, ""It's a big, black jinn inside her. A man she was seeing, but then broke up with to get married to her current husband, told his mom about the breakup. His mom paid a practitioner of some black arts to get a  jinn to interfere with the girl's life, and convince her to come back to him."" Long lot of details short, this big, black jinn was causing trouble in her life by preventing her from praying, sleeping with her husband, and just causing her to stop and have seizures at random times and places.


The old guy considers this information and then says, ""Can you get rid of it?""


The jinn says, ""I can burn him.""


The old guy says, ""Do it.""


Suddenly, Girl T starts screaming and rolling around on the floor, as if in the most horrific agony ever. Now her husband and parents and freaking out, but the old guy tells them to keep back. and all the time Girl A is giving a running commentary. ""His feet are now ashes. His thighs are burned. His torso's burned. His arms are gone."" As the jinn says ""It's done,"" Girl T stops screaming.


The old guy says to Girl A, ""Thank you,"" and then starts reciting in more Arabic, and again she looks like she's having a fit. The she stops, and opens her eyes, and says ""Ok, so when are we starting?"" Her freaked out parents take her away. The old guy tells the parents of Girl T, ""Make sure she sleeps, and she'll be fine by the morning.""


And she was.


Still...my wife says the way the girl's voices changed to men's voice was well creepy.

87,Maine Kennebunkport Farmhouse Ghost,1288316815,"At the beginning of the year my husband and I decided to drive up to Maine and stay in a few places up and down the coast for a few months. We had never lived in Maine, it seemed nice enough, compared to FL (where we lived for 5 years), we missed the snow, and were stressed out from work, so we thought this was a great plan for the new year. 

After a few months in the north of Maine we moved further south. One place we stayed at was a K'Port farmhouse. We found the listing online, it was a good price, and it was on a farm, something we hadn't yet experienced in Maine, and it was close to the little village. 

It was a huge house, broken into two sections. The old house from the 1800's and the newer house built sometime in the 50's. The older half was not part of the rental because there was no heat there, so we stayed in the newer half that had 4 bedrooms. The two houses were connected by living room area with a fireplace. There was a door that kept the other part closed off. It was in that living room where I saw the ghost. 

One morning, a few days after moving in, I went downstairs to feed the cat. As you walk down the stairs, there's a little corner you turn, and you immediately get a good view of the living room. That morning, with the cat leading the way, I turned the corner and saw a woman sitting in the far chair closest to the fireplace. She wore something white-ish. She wasn't looking at me, just staring off. Then I didn't know what to do because I could see through her. So, in my infinite wisdom, I ignored her, went to the kitchen, got the cat food, and rushed back up the stairs. Every morning until the day we left, I kept my eyes averted, fed the cat, and went about my business. I figured if the cat wasn't bothered, I wouldn't be either. 

I never mentioned it to my husband until after we left, because I didn't want to freak him out but it turns out he felt a presence too, just random chills and noises. My cat, who usually slept with us, slept on that same chair, every night, that I saw the lady in. The other half of the house creeped us out when we did a walk through it and we only did it once, it was incredibly cold there. 

The woman who rented it to us lived in another state. She once emailed me a few weeks into our stay to ask me if ""the house was behaving for us"". When we met her to walk through the house (before renting) I was ushered in the front door and I saw another woman sitting in the chair and said hello to her. The woman just smiled and didn't say anything back. When we were through with our look around the house the woman was no longer there. When we told the owner that we liked the way the house looked and that we would like to rent it she replied, ""oh yes, I can tell this house suits you, you're a good fit."" Even then that came across as creepy. Below are links to video walkthroughs that my husband and I made of the second, older, part of the house, and the other half of the house. In the first frame of the other half of the house, you can see into the living room area where the chair and fireplace are. That door at the far hallway leads to the old house.

91,An Interesting Occurence. . .,1288285524,"A friend of mine is a low budget horror filmmaker. His stuff is a lot of fun and his technical skills have grown considerably. Last night, at a local bar, he hosted an evening of scary stories. He had mentioned it a few weeks earlier and I volunteered to share a few. So last night we're sitting in the bar and he gets up on stage, relates a quick intro and then spins a short yarn. He then introduces the next storyteller. She does her thing, he gets back on stage to introduce the next person, and so on and so forth.

One story was told by a young man and his wife. They were there to corroborate certain elements of each others story. He is middle eastern and she is american. They got married in his native Oman. The story they told was of their encounter with a [Jinn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn). She talked about how on the eve of their wedding, as she fell asleep, a large figure in a black shroud appeared at the edge of her bed and offered her a bouquet of flowers. When she brought it to her everybody's attention the next morning, everybody in the house knew about the figure.

Her husband then takes over and begins telling a story about his first encounter with the Jinn. It happened when he was in college. He and his friends drove around to two different villages in Oman to try and scare up a Jinn. When they struck out in the second town, his experience (and mine while he was telling his tale) got a little strange.

He begins by saying that, as he sat in the back of his friend's car, the car seemed to stretch out to an unbelievable length. He described it as if ""space and time were warping"" and he immediately felt uncomfortable in the back seat; as if something had ""crawled inside"" of him. What's worse, when he turned to look at his other friend in the backseat he wanted nothing more than to strangle him. He fights these feelings until he gets home.

He is using the toilet before going to bed that night and he remarked how he was suddenly looking at himself in the bathroom with the Jinn - from a third person perspective.

""You wanted this."" The Jinn says.

""No I didn't."" Replies the man.
""
Yes. This is what you asked for."" The Jinn replies. The man immediately begins reciting an ayat- one of many verses from the Qu'ran specifically written to protect somebody from a Jinn. The man finds himself back in his body, flushed the toilet and opens the bathroom door.

The Jinn is on the other side of the door when he opens it, and it flies at him or, rather, into him.

This is the same Jinn that his future wife would see on the night before their wedding, and these events occurred at the same house.

As he is telling this story, last night, I start to feel very uneasy. As he is discussing the Jinn my vision becomes very narrow and tunnel-like. I don't quite lose my peripheral vision, but this guy is the only thing that I can focus clearly on. It was like a Ken Burns effect - he was clear, almost cut out from this existence, and the surrounding layers were blurred while my peripheral vision was dimmed. I wanted him to stop talking about the Jinn. I desperately needed this guy to stop talking about this subject. I began to sweat a bit. When he finished his tale, everything went back to normal.

When I got home my dogs greeted me in their normal, excited manner. This made me somewhat relieved and thought to myself, ""My dogs are going to protect me tonight, they know that something's up. You're not going to be able to hurt me""; having a silent conversation with an unseen specter. I do this often when I feel as if I'm not alone. I have a mantra, in fact, when I feel dead eyes on me or something passing through the bedroom. First I check to see if my dogs are freaking out. If they're not, I don't think much of it. But I always tell whatever may be passing through, ""I don't mind if you're here. Relax, stay awhile. But if you try to hurt anyone I will sic my dogs on you."" So last night, I brush my teeth, change, and crawl into bed.

Something wouldn't let me sleep.

Every time that I started to drift off, the house would creak, one of the dogs would whimper in their sleep, I would hear the cat land heavy on the floor above, or I would have the most hideous visions creep in beneath my closed eyelids. At one point, one of my dogs woke up startled and moved away from my side of the bed. He rarely moves from my side of the bed - he sleeps there every night. He moved across the room.

Things got worse. The visions were more gruesome - more vivid, the house groaned louder, the cat ran into the room and promptly turned around and left. I began hearing voices, not too distinct, just a word here and there. Muscles spasmed in opposite shoulders and in my legs and lower back. This lasted until about 4 in the morning. I have to get up at 6 in order to get to work.

Exhausted, I conjured up some strength and said aloud, ""Fine. I get it. I shouldn't have said anything. But you're not welcome here tonight. Come back tomorrow night and we'll do this again. For now - I'm too tired to have this conversation.""

Everything stopped and I drifted off to a peaceful, if not abbreviated, slumber.

4,Beach front house --,1288164290,"This happened during the summer 11 years ago when my parents, my Aunt/Uncle and my cousin went down to the South of Taiwan known for its beautiful beaches and resorts.  At the time I was 14 years old and it was the sort of trip that was more spontaneous then anything. Although we were unable to get room reservations in some of the popular hotels there, we went anyways thinking that we will get lucky and find something open.  I can still remember sitting in the car while we went to hotel after hotel, resort after resort with no luck of finding any open rooms.  Finally, after over 3 hours of driving around and calling different places, we found a beach side hotel that had something available but the only catch was it was separate from the hotel by about a 10 minute walk and on a more secluded portion of the beach.  


To give you a better idea of how the beach house is situated, the main hotel itself was facing the ocean and interconnected to the left was very beautiful and spacious pools also facing the beach.  The beach house we were lucky enough to find was farther left of the pools and separated by a patch of trees in which the only way to reach the house is through a small trail in the palm trees or walking on the beach itself.  My first initial reaction to the place was thinking that it was perfect, basically we had a small patch of beach to ourselves, secluded from all the other tourists and vacationers from the hotel and the house itself was fairly spacious to fit my family and relatives.  The house was a 1 story building with 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, and a living room.  Upon entering, you step directly into the living room and to the left, a long hall way with doors that led to the first bed room at the end of the hall, door to bathroom in the middle of the hall, and a door to the second bedroom which when you step out you were basically looking into the living room.  


My first reaction upon entering the house was that it was very very cold inside.  It was the middle of summer in Taiwan and around 2PM in the afternoon when we entered, (hottest time of the day) and even with air conditioning at full blast it was very unusual to feel this cool indoors.  Now thinking about it the cold felt more like the chills you would feel during the winter.  Not paying too much attention, my cousin and I quickly got changed to our swimming trunks and headed out to the beach.  After a couple hours my Aunt called us to change and head over to the pool next to the hotel as everyone was already there, they had a BBQ going on there so my cousin and I went back to the house, got changed and left for the pool.


After finishing dinner and resting a bit to my surprise my cousin had brought his swim trunks and changed and jumped into the pool next to the hotel.  Since I did not bring mine and had left it in the beach house before dinner I had to walk back to grab it.  It was around 8-9PM when I walked from the pool back to the beach house, at that time my family and relatives were still next to the pool finishing up food or sitting around chatting so I went alone to grab my swim gear.  As I walked from the hotel pool to the beach house, I noticed that it was dark and difficult to see.  There were no lights or street lamps on the trail that led to the house.  The only way I was able to navigate through the trees and to the house was from the lights shining far away from the hotel and swimming pools.  Stumbling around I finally reached the front door of the house, as I reached for the door, I felt myself tensing up and anxious.  For some reason standing in front of the beach house door I could feel that something was not right.  Ignoring these feelings and looking forward to chilling in the pool, I unlocked the door and stepped into the living room to grab my trunks.  Again I was hit with a wave of very cold air and this time there was something else I did not experience when I first entered the room but I couldn't tell exactly what it was.  As my room was the first room down at the end of the hall, I quickly started walking towards the door to my room but as I did, I had a horrifying feeling that something in the living room was staring at my back as I walked down the hall.  I started walking faster and faster; fear gripping me.  When I finally got into my room I quickly grabbed my swimming trunks and took a deep breath before I stepping into the hall again.  When I finally had the courage to step into the hall, I was 100% certain and expecting to see something horrifying and staring at me from the living room but fortunately nothing was there.  The fear and panic was still pumping through my blood along with the feeling of something staring at me from the living room.  With my heart racing and half walking and half running to the door I finally got out of the house and raced my way back to the pool and to my family; keeping all that had happened to myself.


Later that night everyone headed back to the beach house together, other then the cold I felt in the house, nothing else occurred.


At 8AM in the next morning my Mom woke me up and told me that we were checking out.  I was very surprised as usually we would at least have breakfast first and chill around some more before checking out at the standard time of 12PM.  After packing my parents and my aunt and Uncle stormed to the lobby of the hotel to check out while my cousin and I sat on a sofa waiting for them.  Although we couldn't hear what was going on, we both could tell that our parents were very upset, from the looks of it, the manager of the hotel even came out to apologize.  My Mom later told us was that we did not have to pay anything for the rooms and on top of that got free Hawaiian shirts.  I did not quite understand why we didn't have to pay but seeing that all the grown ups were still upset my cousin and I did not ask any questions.  After leaving the hotel, my parents followed my uncles car and instead of getting on the highway, stopped by a very large Buddhist Temple.  As my parents were not devout Buddhists, I was surprised they wanted to enter the temple to burn incense out of the blue and even dragged me along, something that had never happened before.  After burning the incense and rituals of bowing to the statue of the deities there, we got back on the car and headed home.


For 8 years I did not really understand what had happened that night and never looked to ask until my cousin brought it up one day.  I told him of what I felt that night and he also admitted the uneasiness he felt staying in the beach house and told me even more. A couple years back, my aunt had finally told him the whole story of what had happened that night, apparently we were not the only ones that experienced strange feelings.  Everyone had felt the unease that night after dinner.  After my cousin and I were asleep, my mom had told my Aunt that she thought she saw a lady with long black hair in a white dress from the corner of her eyes standing in the hall after stepping out of the bathroom.  Later that night my Uncle also experienced the same type of sight.  Waking up to go to the bathroom at 2-3AM, he had opened the door to his room which was closest to the living room and saw a lady there, but instead she was sitting on the sofa with her long hair and of back of her head facing him.  My cousin said that when my Uncle saw this he did not let out a whimper of noise and instead closed the door and decided the bathroom could wait until the next day.  (Till today I still give my uncle mad props, if I saw a sight like that I would probably be shitting bricks) 


The next day along with my parents, my aunt and uncle had went to the hotel front desk to complain about the beach house.  Apparently all the employees knew of the haunted house and knew that everyone that had stayed there either checked out the same night due to some reason or early the next day.  The manager came out to apologize and said that the person checking us in did not know and because everything else was booked in the hotel it was the only option.  


After learning of this it became clear why my parents made me go into the Buddhist temple as Buddhist temples are believed to be able to ward off any evil spirits that may have followed us from the house.  Of course they did not give us a reason why we went as they were afraid it would scare us if we learned the truth.

6,...or do I have that backwards?,1288159187,"This isn't a story, but just an odd musing, an idea I had recently which I feel particularly compelled to put into words.

I'm a fan of science fiction, and so it isn't all that unusual for me to ponder oddball questions like ""How would society be different if we had one less finger on each hand?"" (Mathematics would have gotten off to a completely different start, and the computer age might have arrived a great deal earlier.  Hexadecimal is a lot easier to relate to when you're used to a base 8 system of counting.) or ""Could the world survive the economic and social upheaval which would inherently come with teleportation?"" (Goodbye aviation, courier, and security industries), but one question in particular is itching at the back of my brain, and it demands to be scratched.

I was flipping through a much dog-eared copy of Douglas Adams *The Hittchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* - I do this a lot, although I own copies of the book in better condition - when I came to the section in which Arthur Dent learns that the highest organic lifeform on Earth isn't humans, but is in fact, small white mice.  For once, on whatever impulse or whim, I took the underlying question seriously.  Is mankind actually the dominant lifeform on Earth?

Obviously, this is a pretty complex question, regardless of your cultural background.  There must be clear definitions of what constitutes a ""lifeform,"" and what it means to ""dominate.""  But as I mulled it over, I came to an unsettling conclusion.

The answer is, as you've all guessed, ""No.""  This being /r/nosleep, I'm sure some might be expecting me to answer that the dominant lifeform is some kind of nightmare creature escaped from the darkest reaches of the SCP foundation - that's not the case, but the fact that some might go there is part of the full answer.

Consider the myriad cornucopia of terrors, horrors, frights, chills, and creepypasta which forms the basic underlying structure of Nosleep - things waiting in the shadows, just out of sight, on the other side of the mirror, unseen behind closed doors, waiting to do something unspeakable and unknowable when you can't perceive them.  But had we never heard the tale, we wouldn't even think that they might be there.  Our fear is derived from our knowledge of the idea, and that's what I'm really getting at here: *Ideas.*

Every action you take, every moment of every day, in some way serves some idea, some concept, however primitive or modern.  We dance on the puppet strings of complex fears, dreams, hopes, suspicions, conjectures, and ideas, many of which are older than we are, and a lot of which will survive us by hundreds, if not thousands of years.

To put it into a slightly more visual metaphor: Imagine a hollow world, filled with innumerable floating pinpoints of light - like fireflies or will-o-the-wisps.  On the outside edge of this world are billions of holes of various sizes.  The points of light are raw ideas, and the holes lead into our world, each by way of a human mind.  These concepts are constantly trying to work their way into our existence, through us.  The dominant lifeform on earth doesn't have a genetic structure - it has a *memetic* one.

Now, as I've described it, that doesn't sound so bad.  Fireflies are nice.  A hollow world filled with gently drifting and floating points of light almost sounds peaceful.  But I could just as easily have played on your fears and described these raw ideas as scuttling roaches, slithering snakes, or pitch black spiders with bulbous bodies and needlepoint legs, each trying to crawl, rend, tear, twist and wind its way through your thoughts into existence.

Like I said, not a story.  It's late, I'm full in the grips of both sleep deprivation and insomnia, and it's just an idea I had...",nosleep,PSBlake,/r/nosleep/comments/dx0wo/or_do_i_have_that_backwards/

10,The splash in the woods!,1288134813,"This isn't a terribly creepy story to retell, but it was pure terror at the time. 

Me and 3 other friends went camping.  We were about 14 at the time and my buddy's dad took us.  This was in Northern Nevada... not sure where anymore.  Jarbridge Wilderness perhaps?  Just realized this was almost 18 years ago!  whoah.... 

So we pull into our camping spot and dad starts the campfire with gasoline (he was older and a hard as balls take no nonsense sort of fellow).  We of course start telling ghost stories and get ourselves all worked up.  I remember seeing several satellites go across the sky but at the time we were convinced they were UFOs.  Several hours later dad decides to hit the sack.   We talk amongst ourselves and decide it's time to explore the woods. 

At this point we were all very into fantasy novels.  So our trip into the woods was quickly turned to some real-life role playing.  One of us had a machete (a mighty sword no doubt), someone grabbed a stick and decided he was a wizard... you get the picture.   And because they didn't have flashlights in fantasy novels we decided to go exploring without.  Someone brought a couple glowsticks so we could illuminate our feet if it got too hard to see.

We're in a mountain canyon.  To one side of the campgrounds is a small river, on the other side of the river is several hundred feet of woods and then the mountain shoots up pretty quickly.   So we carefully pick our way over the river to the woods. 

Immediately visions of goblins in the shadows are very poignant.  It's DARK.  The glowsticks are a joke unless you bent over and held them close to the ground.   Undaunted we creep along single file parallel to the river; making up stories of the Darkspawn in the Forest.  Whoever was in front had the machete out and ready to chop something.  Now obviously the river is creating a great white-noise that blankets everything... and occasionally you hear those river ""gurgles""... so now we really can't see nor hear. 

About 20 minutes in one of us (was it me perhaps?  I still have the best hearing out of anybody) heard a very distinct growly ""woof.""  Not like a dog, but like a bear exploding a pant of growly air.  This is NOT bear country - maybe mountain lions or bighorn sheep at most.   We all froze and someone whispered ""get down!"".   We all knelt down in the underbrush and stared around, grasping to hear or see anything.   Several moments later we decide it's nothing and continue forward.   Twice more in about 10 minutes we ALL hear this ""woof"" again.   Now we know the drill and immediately crouch down scanning the dark ass woods around us.   It's all just shadows....and it sucks because we only have a stupid glowstick.   Finally we get to a clearing in the trees which contains a quasi marsh... tall grass growing in pools of water with little dry paths around them.  Slowly the guy with the long stick prods the ground and we make halting progress through the muck.    Then while stuck at one particularly marshy impasse we hear an especially loud ""WOOF"" and crouch down.   Several seconds pass and then SPLASH!  somewhere right in front of us!  Like a hoof or a rock splashing forward at us. 

In terror we stand up and retreat.  Swinging the machete and the stick at our backs, while one of us lead the group back.   Someone grabbed an extra long branchy stick and we took turns being the rear guard - holding it out to act as protection.   We tore ass back to camp in absolute terror.   But once we got across the river and back to the campground everything felt ok and we had a nervous laugh about it.

What it could have been?  Who knows.  But it was certainly a story I'll never forget. .... and always take a flashlight into the woods.

The next weekend me and one of my friend's went to that lake house to get drunk and try to come to terms as to what had happened. We were sitting on the dock at about 3am and slowly this small black cloud came from behind us and creeped out across the lake very slowly. Granted, it could've been from a bbq, or a small fire. But this was 3am and that seemed unlikely. Never seen anything like that before and the image still haunts me.

I should add this cloud was *very* low.  About the height a small bottle rocket would go.  There was no fireworks heard at any point.  This was back in Dec. 2004 and I think I blocked the memory out until recently.  Earlier that day I had gone to his wake.

I'm writing this diary as a recording. I heard that sound again tonight. I can only describe it as a low pitched scream coming from the foot of my bed. Only I can hear it. 

Will try to sleep now, but I don't think it will happen...


Day 2: 
The shrieking get's louder. I started writing this diary because it helps keep me in check. I'm sure its happening but my parents tell me they hear nothing... It's making me feel ill...

It won't stop screaming!


Day 5:
It has not stopped for 3 days now, I think I'm losing it. The screaming is implanting pictures in my mind, pictures of obscure burial mounds and pale white men hanging from trees with black blood dripping softly from their eyes. They stare at me as if they know me, they know what is happening in my head... 

I'm sure I will be crying myself to sleep again tonight.


Day 7:
I saw it watching me in the dark tonight... It was hunched, with bright white eyes and a look of menace on its face. It knew I was looking at it. It knew I was afraid.


Day 8: 
It gets closer to me every night. I look up over my laptop to see it standing there, still grinning, screaming but not opening its mouth...

I no longer cry, only watch...

...I'm so alone.


Day 12: 
Day 8, it was 9 feet away; Day 9 it was 7; Day 10 it was gone; Day 11 it was 3. I just want to kill myself. It's telling me to kill myself; Making me do it.


Day 13:
I awoke to it standing over me. I feel its breath. I try to ignore but I can't anymore.

25,Faceless Drawing,1287977388,"**Part 1**

I am a junior in college majoring in Graphic Arts. Last year I took a Drawing class as a prereq for my Major. I've never been particularly good at drawing, so this was a good opportunity for me to improve. And I did, in many ways. But there was one thing that was a product of that class that I'm not sure I'm happy I ever created.

Towards the end of last year, I was incredibly stressed about tests in my other classes. I've never been a particularly motivated person, always putting things off to the last second. This is not conducive to being a good college student, so it's always caused me stress. In drawing class, a few weeks before the end of the semester, my teacher was having a lazy day and gave us paper and told us just to draw stuff. And so I did. I put all my frustration onto the paper. Frustration about me being me. Frustration about not being able to change who I am. Frustration over failure to succeed in life. I took that charcoal and made something I would forget I drew until almost six months after I drew it.

When I finished, I was embarrassed by it. I'm not sure why, but I was angry I made what I did. My teacher asked us to hang what we drew up on the wall and I refused, against my better judgment. She was not happy about it, but eventually caved and moved on with the class. I took the drawing back to my dorm, and shoved it into my portfolio intending to forget I ever drew it.

About 6 months later, after doing fine in all my classes, much to my relief, and having a wonderful summer break, I went back to college and brought my portfolio with me. I moved it, set up my computer, said hi to my new roommates, greeted my old friends, said good-bye to my parents as they left to head home. I laid on my bed and decided to watch some episodes of Arrested Development on Hulu.

It was a few weeks later when my dad came to visit. He remarked when looking at my room: “Your walls are so empty. You should hang stuff on them.” He was very right, we have very white walls here and the only thing I had hanging up on them was a calender. So I decided to hang some of my own artwork up.

I pulled out my portfolio, which is filled to the brim with artwork, and I just pull the whole mass out. I shuffled through it, picking various pieces I liked more than others. Eventually, I came across the drawing I made the year before. Which now is as good of a time as any to show you what it looks like:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4222914/Drawing.jpg

I saw it, and immediately decided I wanted to hang it up. At the time and in retrospect, I have no idea why I felt that way. It's not my best work or my favorite. Hell, at the time I drew it I absolutely hated it. But seeing it then, I needed to hang it up. Using some 3M double stick tape, I pushed it up onto the north wall of my room, a wall I share with one of my three roommates.

This was about 3 weeks ago.

I'd like to say that “for a while, everything was just fine and dandy” but that was not the case. It was only that night when strange shit started happening with the drawing. I went to sleep super late as is normal, around 4AM or so. My computer faces towards the drawing, so I can see it while I'm working. For some reason, I hadn't noticed that the drawing was gone from where I had placed it. I noticed this, and immediately thought it had fallen down, so I search the floor of the north wall. The drawing was no where to be found. Eventually I gave up and went to sleep.

The next morning, it still wasn't there. I didn't think too much into it, so I just went about my day and went to my classes. I came back after my last class, and my roommate was up making himself dinner. We hadn't gotten to know each other that well, so we just nodded at each other exchanging a “Sup?” and went about our business. But before I could go into my room, he said “Hey, wait.” I turned around as he was walking into his room. 

“Dude, I found this hanging on my wall yesterday, do you know who's it is?” and he comes walking out with the drawing. I was shocked.

“It's mine!” I snatched it away from him, like the drawing was “The One Ring.” He got a bit defensive, asking what was up with me and why I was hanging drawings up in his room. I didn't have an answer for him, and shrugged it off. As far as I was aware, I hadn't moved anything. It had just disappeared, but I wasn't going to tell him this. I hung the drawing back up on my wall, exactly where I had put it before.

Not too long after that, he walks back into my room while I'm playing Assassin's Creed 2 on my computer. A little involved in the game, I don't pay much attention to him. He didn't say “hey” or anything, just walks over to the left of me and pulls the drawing off my wall and starts walking away. 

I didn't even pause the game, I just jumped up from my chair and tackled him to the ground before he could leave my room. I have no idea what came over me, but I know I was pissed as hell at him. I tore the drawing from his hands, it had gotten a white scratch on it during the scuffle which made me even angrier at my roommate, but I resisted the urge to beat the shit out of him and took the drawing, placing it exactly where it was before. My roommate got up from the floor, and walked into his room. I sat on my bed and just stared at my door.

Later on I hear him working out in the kitchen and I get up from my bed. I noticed he didn't seem bruised at all from our confrontation. I greeted him and he greeted back, very friendly. It was as if nothing happened at all.

And this was just the beginning.

This happened to me almost every night. Lights off, I would lay down and try to sleep when I would hear someone breathing close to me. At first I thought I might just be hearing myself, so I would hold my breath for a moment. 

But the breathing would continue.

I remember I would then get up and check maybe it's my dad's loud snoring, or my siblings. But of course, it wasn't because all their doors would be closed and I wouldn't hear any sound coming from their rooms.

It got to a point that I would leave my radio or TV on the whole night, just so I won't have to hear the damn breathing.

  

**Night terrors**

Yes, I know this is some natural phenomenon, but given I was already kinda freaked out about my room, it didn't help. And for some reason it seemed to happen to me much more frequently when I was living in that house. 

I remember two distinctly: in one dream, I could hear that breathing again, except it kept getting louder and louder, and sounded like it was coming from inside the bed, like something was rushing up toward me from below. I felt like I was awake and I could not move my body until the last moment.

In another dream, I again ""woke up"" but could not move my body, or at least I could with great difficulty. When I managed to shift my head a bit I saw a black figure standing outside my window.

  

**Dead flies**

This is similar to another recent post here at /nosleep. Seems innocent enough but taken together with everything else, kinda creepy. What would happen is I would see a huge fly going around my room, but it wouldn't seem normal because the fly would keep bumping into the four walls, until it would finally fall dead. On my bed. This happened more than once.

  

**My portrait**

By far however, this incident freaked me out the most. It was late at night (around 2am), and I was surfing the net for, ahem, entertainment. I was alone using our family PC which was in our library/study. There were five portraits hanging on the wall behind me - one for each family member. I have an uncle who is an artist who gave them to us as gifts.

So I'm using the computer when - CRASH. I turn around to see that my portrait, out of all five, had fallen down. There really was no reason for the portrait to fall. It is of course possible that the hook loosened through time, but what were the chances of that happening, to my portrait specifically, while I was there. Needless to say I quickly shut off the computer got my ass the fuck out of there.

34,Why we seek the fear?,1287933901,"Just some random personal thoughts as we approach Halloween.  A bit of a conversation with myself that I hope scares you too.

--

Why do we come here, to tell and read these stories?  Why does the ghost story persist?  We do it because as much as it scares us, we desperately want to believe in an external cause.  We need to objectify the fear and the evil into something that is not us, an outside entity on which we can make war, and possibly triumph.  

Because the alternative is to blame ourselves.  To admit that the cruelty, anger, and evil that makes our hair stand on end comes from within.  From our own fragile minds.  And this is an even more terrifying alternative.  To believe that we actively manifest our own realities.  Realities over which our higher thinking mind seemingly has no real control.  Powerful forces that can tear us apart from within.

And so we choose the more palatable option, the one that soothes our simple superstitious minds.  Rather than face the true terror just below the surface, behind our own mind's eye.  We insist on an external force.  And sometimes we happen across a story that hits a cultural or or archetypical nerve.  A form or sound, or even a situation that invokes some deep ancient fight or flight instinct.  

The power of simple thoughts repeated across large populations is a real thing.  And that is what will bring Slenderman to life.  All of those feelings of fear focused on that one form, that is what will give him the ability manifest and cross over.  It's already starting.  Go ahead and fear the Slenderman.  Your fear will grow, and will allow him to destroy you.  To destroy the you that made him.",nosleep,inkman,/r/nosleep/comments/dvo43/why_we_seek_the_fear/
35,Paper,1287908113,"There was a knock on my door. A sharp knuckled rap. I briefly awoke, glared at the clock. Thrust my head under the pillow and fell back asleep.

In the morning, I nearly tripped over the box outside my door. The box was small, well-used. It was covered in cheap packaging tape. There was no mailing label. I slit the tape and opened it. Inside was a small rectangular piece of white paper, folded in half like a card. There was a simple, filled in circle on the right side of the paper, opposite from the fold. I opened it. The inside was blank. I flipped it over, looking for a trademark or signature. Nothing. I smile when I’m nervous.

*What the fuck?*

That night, I was asleep in bed. Then the knock. Hard, abrupt, business-like. This time, I awoke. I sat up in bed, head cocked to my dark hallway, listening. The knock came again.

I turned on my light and went to the front door. Looked out the peep hole. Nothing. I opened the door to find another box, smaller this time. The hair stood from my neck. This box was not taped shut. The lids were partially agape. I could see tiny packing peanuts peeking through the crack. I carefully reached in, fingers fanning through the clingy styrofoam.

And just as quickly, I dropped the box, its contents spilling out all over the floor. I felt a hand. Writhing and warm, fingers meeting mine, nearly entwining itself around my palm before I withdrew. Tentatively, I flipped the box over, emptying the peanuts and looked within.

There was a sheet of paper taped to the bottom of the box. Black, this time. Actually, no. I look closer. It’s been shaded violently with a pen, in thin hurried hatches. The center looked purple from abuse. I could see my oily fingerprints freshly imprinted on the ink.

I quickly gathered up the peanuts from the floor and shoved it back into the box. I sat at the kitchen table, thinking of an explanation. I dug through my trash and found the box left from the night before. Inside is the sheet of paper and I realize the significance of the filled circle on the outside. I open it carefully.

This time, there is a figure, drawn in the same black ink. It nearly fills the page. The details are lost. It is nothing more than a shadow on a background of white. The head is cocked sideways, almost earnestly. It’s staring through this door, at me.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/dvlfg/paper/

42,Hauntings at past schools.,1287787590,"These are some stories of hauntings that I have heard in the past few years. I attended a very large high school in Houston, TX, and there was a story about a girl in a white dress. I heard this from a friend a few years back.

Kim was a very quiet girl, but very passionate when it came to theatre. She didn't like to act, but she was very into teching, lights, and sound. Unfortunately, whenever it was show night, she would never wear the traditional black garb, she always wore white, which of course, did not sit well with the other techies. She got a lot of crap  from them, and was blamed for ruining the majority of their shows. They would tease her and ignore her, and this led her to become very depressed. She was a beautiful girl with long, black hair and gorgeous eyes, but she was extremely anti-social and had no friends in theatre because of her refusal to wear black for the shows. In the second semester of her freshman year, after practice, she walked up through the boneyard * loft and followed the stairs to the catwalk *. It was up there where she hung herself, in her favorite white dress. Story goes that the janitor came into the auditorium to clean, and saw her lifeless, hanging there, just as her head snapped from her body and fell to the ground. 

Of course the story's been embellished over the years, but the creepy shit that happens around the theatre department is definitely all true. If you go up to the boneyard when it's dark out, you can usually see stuff come off the racks. Just as if somebody is picking them up and dropping them. Usually dresses. I went up there with my stage manager and the lights shut off on us twice. The light switch is all the way down the stairs, and the gate was shut so we would have heard somebody come in if they were going to prank us. Some kids took a ouija board up there once and came down pretty shaken up a short while later. They refused to talk about it afterwards, only noting that her name was Kim.

Once I came to college, I heard about another ghost story immediately. There's two sister dorms (identical dorms) at Stephen F. Austin University, Griffith and Kerr. In Griffith, I believe on the third or fourth floor, a girl played with a ouija board and then jumped out of her window immediately after. Every night around 3:00 am, people hear running through the hall. The first time my friend heard it, she assumed it was somebody being disruptive and came into the hallway to tell them to STFU, but she didn't see anyone. She later found out about the ghost and has trouble sleeping. A few girls have gotten up to use the restroom in the middle of the night and have seen a girl standing at the end of the hall. The elevators sometimes become active in the middle of the night, and open on the third floor and sit there. Oh, also, those are some of the most janky as hell elevators I've ever ridden in my life. They'll sway back and forth and it usually sounds like it's scraping against the walls or banging against something. They shake violently every time they stop and every time the doors open and close. The doors have also been known to close on people. Eek.

* Also: Our boneyard is a loft only reachable by a long flight of stairs. It's where we keep our costumes, props, etc. And the catwalk is above the stage, usually above the audience, hidden from view, and that's where they fix up the lights and whatever. (correct me if I'm wrong)

I know these stories aren't too exciting, but they freak me out whenever I think about them. ",nosleep,ilestledisko,/r/nosleep/comments/dv3kb/hauntings_at_past_schools/

44,So I think Death came for me,1287780068,"A few months ago I was sound asleep when something woke me up. I remember the first thing I felt before I woke up was terror. I've felt fear before but nothing like this; I hadn't even opened my eyes yet and I felt my life was in danger. 

I sleep on my right side and my clock in on the night stand in front of me when I open my eyes from this position. I remember looking at the clock to see what time it was and thinking to my self why I would be awake at 3AM. It took a few moments before I realized that the clock was moving. Then I felt the hands, six pairs of them on my left side... It wasn't the clock that was moving, it was me. I was being violently rocked back and forth by those hands, to the point where I would almost be tossed from the bed before being reefed back.

My mind started racing, I kept trying to think of what might be happening. ""Sleep paralysis."" I thought, I was having a nightmare and partially woke up, but that didn't make sense because I was having a *very* non-nightmareish dream involving some lovely young ladies. ""I have to see these hands."" Was my next thought. ""Once I look and see nothings there I'll realize it's just me rocking my self and my sleep addled mind making up a reason for it.""

I slowly raised my head. It was very difficult, my muscles didn't want to move. Further evidence of sleep paralysis. I brought my head up to look down the length of my body and was shocked to see six pairs of roughly hand shaped indents in the covers, precisely where I felt them rocking me. The rocking had stopped when I lifted my head but the pressure was still there, firm but not painful. Then I saw it...

In the corner of my room, standing near the open door was a tall hooded and cloaked figure. Even though my room is quite bright because of the street lamps outside this thing was in full shadow, in a part of my room and should have been fully visible. I remember quite clearly that the only thing really visible was it's hands, They were skeletal and gleamed in the ambient light. Then I looked where it's face would have been but it was completely black. Shadowed by the hood I could only make out one detail. Where it's eyes should have been were two pits of deeper black.

""It's just a dream,"" I thought ""It can't hurt me.""
It chuckled. Not a particularly menacing chuckle, more like one of mild amusement. It sounded like something echoing up from a cave. I rolled over and shut my eyes, and all at once the pressure on my side stopped. I thought it was over until I felt something sit on the bed beside me. My nose was filled with the stench of rotting flesh as I felt it lean towards me. It felt like and eternity went by before I heard it whisper one word in my ear.


Soon.

46,Been having multiple dreams related to Aliens the past few weeks,1287758651,"This is my first post to /r/nosleep and last night I had quite the dream regarding aliens again...

Some history: I have always been fascinated with UFOs and alien abduction stories. Communion is one of my favorite books and I read it every so often (along with Transformation). I used to read all about people's experiences when I was in my teen's. Now fast forward. I am in my mid-twenties and married with two children. Have a very nice paying job doing IT and things are very good. My wife and I have a stable relationship and have had our ups and downs. We live in an apartment complex and have never experienced anything weird or strange.

I honestly don't even look up stuff about UFOs or aliens anymore and I hardly think about now but the past few weeks I have been having vivid dreams of aliens (typically looking like the infamous Grays that everyone knows) just coming to me. I don't recall anything bad happening to me but they just come to me and look at me. For example, last night my dream, I was standing in our bedroom but almost all the furniture was gone in it except for our TV stand. I take a look down the hallway and I see a plump little alien staring at me walking towards me. I freak out in the dream of course and try to wake myself up (I typically know when I am in the dreaming state) but having a hard time doing so. I finally wake myself up and feel like the alien is still watching me. Yes I am fully aware of sleep paralysis and what it can do to the mind.

Other dreams I've had the past few weeks are similar and they always involve me, my family is never involved. The aliens just keep finding me in my dreams and I always wake up feeling like they are still in the room watching me. I don't feel it really scares me to the point of not being able to sleep it's just starting to get a little unnerving since it keeps happening more and more over the past few weeks. Have I been stressed out lately? No more than usual.

I've previously posted a [short summary of some UE I did with friends](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/dhsou/any_creepy_urban_exploration_stories_out_there/c10bl94) and some [weird experiences with an ex](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dsy89/i_still_wonder_if_i_could_have_protected_her/) (no not THAT kind).  So, here's a bit more about some of the strange stuff in my life...*

Bugs don't like me.  The feeling is mutual.  It's not a full-blown phobia, but basically anything larger than an ant or fly gives me the hellacious willies.  For the most part I try to ignore them, and even though I despise bugs I try not to kill them unless it's a huge problem.  It seems kind of like they actively dislike me, though.

I used to think this was a self-fulfilling prophecy.  After all, some bugs can sense unease in people like dogs can and will instinctively try to defend themselves/their shelter.  The second I even *think* some kind of creepy crawly is around, ""unease"" is an understatement of my usual feelings.  I'm also sure that people find bugs in their room, car, etc. all the time, it's just that since I hate it so much it sticks in my memory more and I subconsciously exaggerate how often it happens.  But sometimes...

For instance, I currently live in a small, two-bedroom apartment with one roommate.  Recently we've had a bit of a problem with [camel crickets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaphidophoridae).  They're completely harmless, but look disgustingly scary and they're fucking ninjas (they can jump like four feet in the air, they make absolutely NO noise, and they can crawl on walls/ceilings like spiders, and since they eat fabrics they have a tendency to ""hide"" in piles of clothes or cracks in padded furniture).  For a week we found one every night, and it was always me who found them.  Either in the bathroom right when I needed to go, or under my chair in my room before I went to bed.  Always only one, for a week, always found by me.  Haven't seen one since.  About a week later while I was taking a shower I found an ant in my mouth.  We don't even have ants anymore since my roommate sprayed (forgot to mention, he's an exterminator.  I don't think irony is the right word, but...).

Wasps and hornets are especially bad.  I more than dislike them, I actively despise them, and they definitely aren't fond of me.  I can think of at least three different occasions where I was in a crowded room with at least 20 other people, completely unaware of the threat at all (so the ""they can sense you're worried and it makes them worried"" argument has no bearing), and of course the first person they always decide to land on and scare the piss out of is me.  In the cases where I am aware of them in a crowded place, it always seems like I'm the only person that notices.  Nobody else ever seems to even give them a glance or try to keep track, but I can't NOT watch where the winged little demons are going.

Anyway, the main thing I'm posting about happened...  I'd say six or seven years ago, which would make me about 16.  It was summer, I was at home.  My parents had gone to visit some other family, and since I was a fairly respectable young man it was alright for them to leave me home alone for a day or two.

Things were alright, just sitting around playing games in the basement, and I decided to get dinner.  Our basement (it's the bottom floor, about half of it is in the ground and the other half is above because we live on a hill) connects to our garage, where we have a big freezer that we keep frozen dinners and such in.  I headed in to get probably a hot pocket or something (I never said I was a healthy kid) but I heard this buzzing.  I looked around and sure enough, there were something like fifteen bees flying around the garage, and at least a dozen more dead on the ground.  I couldn't tell how they'd gotten in, and there didn't seem to be anything in there they were after.  I almost crapped my pants when a few started buzzing around me, but I was hungry dammit so I nabbed a dinner and got out pretty quick.  My parents would be back tomorrow and I could just have cereal for breakfast, so I figured I'd just let it go for now.

The night goes on and I pretty much forget about the bees.  It's getting late and I decide to head to bed.  I go up to my room and I'm pretty exhausted, so I'm about to just flop right down fully dressed and without even turning on the lights.  Right when I get to the foot of the bed, though, I remember that I'm going to be working at a local theatre summer program tomorrow, and there's this really cute girl in one of my classes, so maybe I should decide on an outfit now instead of getting dressed in a groggy dash tomorrow.  I flick on the light and I'm immediately glad I did.

The first thing I notice is a bee weakly circling next to my bed.  Almost as if it was waiting for me to turn on the lights and see, it spirals downwards and quietly dies on my end table.  At that point I notice at least twenty more dead bees, a trail of insect corpses leading from the air vent in the corner of my room to my bed.

54,I don't like dreams.,1287643397,"I had a dream last night that really shook me to my core. I was relaxing on my couch, inside my apartment, alone. I was looking through photos of my families trip to Europe, really enjoying the moment. I took a gander over at the door for no apparent reason and noticed the door was unlocked. (I have a habit of always locking my door.)

So, I got up off my ass and walked to the door, kind of rushing since I had this feeling in my stomach that something was not right. Increasingly nervous as I approached the door, I reached for the lock but before I could turn it- the handle moved and someone put pressure against the door from the other side. I freaked and shoved the door forward in order to get the lock in. But, before I could, the person on the opposite side pressed against the door so hard, that it knocked me back.

I was pushed a few steps back and a medium-sized man with large bug eyes walked in through my doorway. If you have seen the website ""have you seen this mans face in your dreams""- it was an uncanny resemblance. He casually walked in, looking at me, and said ""your door was unlocked.""

Anxiety completly controlled my body at this point. I wanted to run, but I couldn't. I tried to scream, but nothing happened. My heart was racing and I could feel it pounding through my skin. He walked up closer to my face and I was completly paralyzed by fear. 

Then -BAM, I was awake. My heart was beating uncontrollably and I was still paralyzed. I couldn't move- my body was stuck still. My eyes were able to look around but my body wouldn't function. I told my arm and my other limbs to my move, but they were frozen still. After like 30 seconds or so, I slowly moved my arms and then the rest of my body. I hadn't experienced fear like that since I was a child. The entire day for me was ruined by that dream and I'm a bit apprehensive about going to sleep again tonight and seeing that man.",nosleep,radiohead87,/r/nosleep/comments/du90p/i_dont_like_dreams/

58,The Woman on the Bed,1287616420,"So most of the stories i have seen here have been based in the real world. I haven't seen much supernatural stuff, but I felt the need to post this story anyways. This story was told to me by a friend of mine as we drove to visit our sisters' college graduation (they were also friends). 

A little background, my friend and I both went to Ohio University, located in SE Ohio in Athens. It's an amazing school that has a little bit of a secret, it's known as America's most haunted university. There are all these different stories that you hear, and it's really quite cool. This one takes place in a dorm called the Convocation Center.

My friend was a freshman living in the Convo center with three other girls. She was never one to believe in ghosts and stuff and she's still not sure what happened that night.

So, one weekend she was in the dorm room alone (all her roommates had either gone home for the weekend or were out with other friends). She woke up from sleeping and saw a woman sitting at the edge of her bed. The woman, as she described it, was wearing 'old time clothes, similar to the style of early 20th century. The woman was just staring off into space, paying zero attention to my friend. My friend thought she was just dreaming so she sat up a little bit in her bed to wake herself up fully. The woman *turned and looked at her*.

At this point she very much so realized that she was not dreaming so she threw the covers off her bed and ran to her next door neighbors, a group of four guys. She told them what had happened and asked if she could spend the night sleeping on their floor because she didn't want to be in that room alone. One of the guys offered to go back to her room and get her blankets and stuff.

A little while later he came back and asked her to repeat the story she had told him. As she did, she could tell that he was starting to figure something out. The guy proceeded to tell her that there was nothing in her room, but the bed was perfectly made when he went in there.

I don't know how true this story is, I wasn't there myself. But to this day she swears that it really happened exactly as she described it. I've never seen proof of the paranormal but I can guarantee that if I saw that, I'd shit myself.",nosleep,al343806,/r/nosleep/comments/du3f8/the_woman_on_the_bed/

60,The parking garage,1287606982,"I was 10 years old at the time.  We lived in the inner city, so there wasn't a whole lot of places for kids to play.  This was the mid-80's.  Our parents just shoved us out the door to wander the streets and find something to do.  

So it was a cold February weekend, me and my two best friends were walking through one of many run-down neighborhoods goofing off and ended up playing at an underground parking lot next to some old apartment buildings.  

The main ramp down to the underground lot had frozen over and had basically turned into a 20' ice slide.  You'd run and slide down trying to stay on your feet, or scoot down on your butt, or go ""suicide style"" on your belly head first.  Then you'd sidle up the edge where the concrete hadn't frozen over, hugging the wall to get back up and repeat.  We did this for about an hour before my friend Ricky calls us down into the lot to ""look at something"".

There was practically no light once you went further past the end of the ramp, and with it being a bright February day, our eyes barely adjusted to the dimness, but Ricky insisted there was something ""white"" up further where cars would be parked and he wanted to check it out.  As boys, we'd do stuff like this to freak each other out, so we played along with Ricky.  

We let him lead us down further into the dark car park, and after about 30 yards, I definitely saw something white and fluttering in the dimness, and by the sudden silence, I knew everyone else saw it too.  My other friend, Jay, tried to say something smart-assy, but it fell flat.  Without even saying anything I remember we all stopped walking at the same time.  I guess we all share a common intuitive sense of when ""far is far enough"".  So we're standing there, in the semi dark, knowing we all saw something white and moving, and we're all thinking who's going to be the first to suggest we head back.  Well, it sure the hell wasn't going to be me.  

So with typical 10 year old bravado, I nonchalantly pushed ahead, and pretended that I was more curious than terrified, and hoped to god that the other two would follow me.  They did.  

So we walk about another 10 yards, and we definitely see a piece of white cloth. By now my eyes had adjusted and I could see it hung over a corner of a low surface, and it was probably more gray-blue than white.  It was contained in a metal frame, with wheels at the feet.  Despite most of it being hidden in shadow, it became obvious what it was.  It was a hospital bed.  

So we're all standing there, looking at the foot of this hospital bed with the blue-gray sheet hanging over the corner that would flap as it caught a breeze.  The weirdness of this was really creeping me out and my imagination was starting to spiral out of control.  So Ricky, or Jay, I don't know who, nudged me forward and said ""you gonna pull that sheet off?""  At this point, I think my balls had crept up to my throat.

Of course I said I would, so I walked forward while the two hung back.  At least I thought they were just hanging back, later, I realized that they would have already started to walk back to the ramp because there was no way I could have caught up to them.

Anyway, so I'm walking slowly up to the bed, determined to yank the sheet off and establish myself as ""not chicken shit"".  I got about 2 or 3 feet away, enough to reach over and grab the corner, my brain was just going over time, it wanted to see a shape lying on the bed, at the same time it was trying to deny that anything was there. I just kept my eyes low, and focused on the corner of the sheet, and grabbed it.  I took a big leaping step back and yanked it with all my strength.

I kind of expected to do that thing where magicians yank a sheet from a dining table, but it didn't work out that way.  The sheet snagged on something, and I had pulled with enough force to actually pull the whole bed towards me.  The wheels squeaked and the whole thing started to rumble forward.  I freaked, and started to turn and run, and that's when I saw Ricky and Jay had been long gone.

I ran for it, forgetting that I was still holding on to the sheet, and when it tugged back on my arm, I let it go and didn't look back.  All I heard were its crazy rusty wheels squeaking and the whole frame rattling as it creaked behind me.  I just kept imagining that it was *right on my heels* and kept running.  I bolted up the ramp, got hit by the sudden bright light, and promptly slipped and fell flat on my face on the ice.  

And I started to *slide back down to the bottom of the ramp as the bed was still rumbling somewhere behind me*.  I'm sure this would be a pretty humorous picture if you were trying to envision this, but it was the most terrifying experience at the time.  I tried to scramble up to my feet before I reached the bottom, trying to edge to the side of the concrete wall where there was less ice, but I was way too panicked and I fell again, bashing my knee and whacking my head twice, once on the concrete wall, and again on the ice.

So here's the gap in my memory that still bothers me today.  I remember waking up, and it was *dark*.  It couldn't have been more than past noon, bright and sunny when we got here, and now it was dark enough that the street lights were on.  And I was lying on the icy ground, about 10' at the *top of the ramp*.  I have no idea how I ended up back outside, and why no one would have noticed me lying there, and why it was almost 5 hours later.

I was cold, and achy and I just trudge home in a daze.  I got a yelling at from my mother for being late, but that's about it.  I had supper and went downstairs to watch TV, except I didn't feel like watching anything, and just went to bed. 

Later, I'd chew out Ricky and Jay for being chicken shits for running away, but I never told them what happened to me, and they *never asked*.  For a few years, I'd still jab them for being chicken shits, but they never asked me about the bed, and I never told them because I was actually ashamed, and embarrassed and confused about the whole situation.  We'd all eventually move away, and totally lost contact.

So that's it, I still can't quite reconcile what happened to me after sliding down that ramp, and I hate thinking about it for too long.  It was just fucking strange.  I remember in college, I would have nightmares about a bed on wheels chasing me through the streets at night. It sounds utterly ridiculous, and the image is quite comical, but it gives me the chills every time I think about it.

61,Man at the window (Apparently true),1287606350,"This story was told by a friend who swears it's true. To me though, it seems like one of those ""a friend of a friend knows a guy who.."" story's. It's still creepy as hell though.

Also, please note that my friend and I live in Wishaw, a town in Scotland. Wishaw is near *another* town called Carstairs which is known for having a maximum security Mental Institution. You usually have to murder someone to be committed to this place. (http://goo.gl/39f5).

I'll type it how it was told by him:

""My Grandad lives in a house in amongst a lot of fields. Like a farmers house. It's really near Carstairs.

One night he was just sitting in watching the TV when he hears someone knock on his window. He looks over and sees a man smiling and waving at the window. My Grandad was a big man, not afraid of anything, so naturally he just waves back and ignores the man from there on. The man at the window persists on knocking and giving my Grandad a wave whenever they catch eyes but, after about 10-20 minutes of doing this, he eventually wanders off.

The next morning, my Grandad hears a knock on the door. It was the police. They asked him if he saw a suspicious looking man last night to which my Grandad replys ""As a matter of fact, there was someone smiling at me through the window. I just ignored him though. He wasn't doing any harm."" 
The Police then ask to come and for my Grandad to answer a few questions. Apparently the guy at the window had just escaped from the Mental Hospital...""",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/du0vd/man_at_the_window_apparently_true/

63,the walk home,1287601385,"My cousins and I used to love hearing stories from my grandmother (above all) and others about all the creepy and paranormal stuff she and others have experienced back in Pakistan and India.  This is the one my dad told me that weirded me out the most as a child.

One day my father's uncles were walking home after dark.  They used to live in a small village surrounded by farms and such and the road they were taking home had a row of houses on one side and a very large cornfield on the other.  So while they are proceeding at their leisurely pace they hear the bleating of a goat somewhere up ahead.  Since houses bordered this road they had some illumination from lights inside the homes and could see that further up ahead on the side of the corn field is a small baby goat.  My father's uncles thought nothing of it and readily assumed somehow it had gotten lost so one of them lifted it up by putting one arm around its midsection with the assumption they'd return it to whomever it belonged to in the morning.  My uncles continue a short distance further when the one carrying the goat felt as if it was getting a bit heavier.  He looked down and noticed nothing wrong - until he happened to glance back a bit further and found that the goats legs had stretched and were still firmly planted where they originally picked it up from.

Suffice it to say they immediately dropped the baby goat and ran the rest of the way home.",nosleep,mansoorz,/r/nosleep/comments/dtzdb/the_walk_home/
64,The text message,1287598993,"So as another user mentioned in a separate post today, /r/nosleep can definitley cause your imagination to run wild. Since I subscribed two weeks ago I've been reading the stories every day and in the last few days have noticed that my perception of noises, light and tempurature have gotten a little paranoid. It's okay, tis the season. But last night something truly creepy happened to me not helped by this paranoia and a few specific stories I had just read.

So, I go to bed around 12am last night, not feeling too uncomfortable because I'd just had a few beers and had a fun conversation with my lover boy online. Fell asleep easily, smiling, my kitties in place at the foot of the bed. I wake up at 3am to my the cat's scratching at the door to be let out and that's when all the stories of things under the bed, in the closet and at the window start flooding into my mind. I call to my cats to try to change their minds but they make it clear it's non-negotiable. So I wait until my eyes adjust to the dark a little bit and finally get up to open the door, placing my first step as far away from the foot of the bed as possible. That's when my text message alert goes off, loud and completely startling. For some reason I get a bad feeling about this. All of my friends know that I would never be up at 3am on Tuesday night as I work mon-fri every morning without fail, and they would know not to try to contact me that late unless it's an emergency. Also although I used to run with a pretty wild crowd in which middle of the night texts weren't so rare at all, this is not the case anymore. The people who text me are domesticated, they wouldn't pull some mid-week drunk shit. 

So I'm a little afraid to check it, I convince myself momentarily to just leave it for the morning and that I probably would've slept through it anyway if I wouldn't have woken up to the cats, thinking the whole time how strange it was that I got the text during the 5 minutes of the whole night I was actually awake. Finally I decide that it might be an emergency and that ghouls aren't probably that technologically advanced anyway. Kind of laugh at my self and open my phone.

My heart stops. ""Wanna play?"" This is not an emergency and it's not some booty call from an old boyfriend. I check the number, it's local, no history in my phone with it. It like who ever sent it knew I had just gotten out of bed. My eyes dart to the window, my bedroom is on the second story and the shades are completely drawn anyway. I creek the door open, I can hear my roommates walking around talking casually (night owls). I turn on my light open the door and show them the message. They help me inspect under the bed just to be safe, it's more embarrassing under there than scary though. We double check that the doors are locked and I end up chalking it up to some guy I must have given my number to or for Christs sakes a wrong number even.

Go back to bed, rattled but too tired to stay awake thinking about it any longer. A couple hours later, the 3 beers I had drank right before bed hit my and I'm up to pee. As I enter back into my room it fucking goes off again. My heart sinks again, I'm terrified to check it but I have to. ""I like playing"". 

So now I'm up for the night, it's 3 hours until I would normally have to get up but screw sleeping now. I received no more messages and I tried calling the number from work. Voice mail not set up. I'm scared now, who's fucking with me and why? Why did they seem to know the moment I got out of bed both times? I might just turn my phone off tonight.",nosleep,madelinecn,/r/nosleep/comments/dtyoa/the_text_message/

I've been waking up in the middle of the night, sweating and confused. I can't remember where I am for the first few minutes, but after that I find myself settling down.

This all seems to happen after a reoccurring nightmare. In this nightmare, I am running as fast as I can down a thick forest. I know something is chasing me, but I don't know what it is but I'm really frightened regardless. I end up hitting a dead end; I feel the shadow of whats chasing me begin to loom over me. I look up at the wall and splattered across the entire surface in what looks black ink is a deformed oval with an wonky X over it. Right as I take notice of this, I turn around to face whats behind me but its at that moment that I wake up shaking and scared. (I have crudely drawn the symbol that I see on the wall: http://i.imgur.com/SSzxK.jpg )

I manage to go back to sleep, but I notice that I have become increasingly aware of my surroundings. But I have to be honest, As the nightmares continue I find myself hoping to dream long enough to see whats behind me.

Because I'm starting to feel, whatever it is, it's always behind me.

73,Do any of these stories ACTUALLY affect you?,1287580127,"I see a lot of comments under these posts like 'great i'll never get to sleep' or 'i'll be thinking of that all day'.  Are you guys just blowing smoke or do these stories actually embed themselves into your mind?  Since I've started reading nosleep on Sunday(first time) I haven't been able to stop.  I'm reading everything I come across, punishing myself for reading them by reading more.  The paranormal and super natural posts don't get to me much as the probable stories, the 'man under the bed' or the 'guy tapping on the window'.  But then some do get under my skin, the ones where I can visualize the subject.  Slender man.  I can see slender man in my windows after watching Marble Hornets.  I know it's ridiculous, that he's 100% fabricated and untrue and impossible.  But while the face in my window might appear to be featureless and white, and my mind tells me there's not such thing as slender man, the reality might be much more terrifying, that there is in fact a man in my window watching me.  Waiting. These last few days have been fairly difficult.  

These posts have actually changed my behavior.  It's subtle, but I can tell.  Yesterday I came home from work, and though it's bright out, I turned on every light in my apartment.  It's a studio so one light would illuminate the whole place.  That night I caught myself not turning my back to the frosted window in the shower because of what I might miss should I turn around, but I also stared hard at it as I washed so I would be able to close my eyes faster if I saw something that shouldn't be there.  I've noticed that I won't look at any of my windows at night.  I live on the second floor in my building, but there's a tree right outside the window.  I refuse to look at it.  I used to be a very 'what ever happens, happens' kind of person.  Someone might break in?  Whatever happens, happens.  Now i'm worrying about things.  Someone might break in?  Let's move, and I don't want to be on the ground floor or have an accessible window.

Yesterday I saw this [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dnc8q/could_anyone_here_copy_and_paste_the_original/) about smile.dog.  I read the creepypasta, then the article linked in comments.  I didn't get to read it while at work so I pulled it up on my phone on the train going home.  I flicked my finger up on the screen so that the article flew by so I could see how long it was.  Pretty long.  As the screen came to a slow stop, it revealed the edge of an image.  Obviously smile.dog, I hesitated.  I had read what people said about it, knew the risk.  I told myself not to be fucking retarded and just look at the damn picture of a dog, though I still debated whether or not I should do it there on the subway or wait until morning when I got to work.  I didn't dare look at home by myself.  Eventually curiosity won.  I reasoned that I was on a crowded train and wouldn't be too freaked out if I were surrounded by people.  I took a breath and scrolled over.  I had never felt so vulnerable and alone while simultaneously being in a small crowded room.  I only caught a glimpse of it as my stop came up as soon as I viewed it.  I got home and didn't think about it again, though I still tortured myself and read nosleep.  This morning I was determined not to let a stupid dog picture ruin me.  I hadn't thought about much else last night aside from smile.dog even though I told myself I wouldn't As I walked to my office from the train station all I could do was think about smile.dog and how it couldn't possibly do anything.  I saw a tiny dog, Pomeranian I think, on the corner and saw that damn smile.  'Figures' I thought, and scolded myself for letting my mind get carried away.  I sat down to my desk and again went to the article linked in the comments above.  I scrolled down and took a good long look.

There's nothing inherently SCARY about smile.dog, but the picture is 'off' somehow.  Realizing it was obviously a creation rather than a captured moment, it put my mind at ease, but only slightly.  I closed the tab.  I refuse to let myself be influenced by the power of suggestion.  After all, that's all it could possibly be.

74,The Chair Ghost.,1287560557,"True story.
Back in 1998 I lived in a small 2 bedroom apartment with my parents. It was a nice quiet place, generally a safe building in a suburb of Minneapolis. I absolutely loved living there until one life changing night. I shared one of the rooms with my younger brother he was rather young at the time, 5 or 6 years old, so we left the light on at night. Anyhow one night I woke up to a ""thump!"" I look at my door and the chair my grandfather had made for me was knocked over on it's side. My first thought was that it must have been something else because nothing possibly could have knocked my chair over, then came a quiet screech that came from the kitchen right outside my door. I looked up and froze, there was a shadow about 6 feet tall lurking in my kitchen. I instantly pulled my blanket up to my nose so I could watch it without it seeing me for the most part. I wanted to scream for my parents, but was terrified that the ghost/demon would come kill me. This thing was all black and basically looked like a ghost would. I sat there in awe not knowing what to do as it walked out of the kitchen to where I could not see it and then came another BANG! it had knocked over our rocking chair in the living room. At this point I was sure it was going to come and kill me being 10 years old, but after that had happened I never saw or heard it again. I didn't sleep the rest of the night and told my parents what had happened in the morning, they tried telling me it was the cat, but I wasn't stupid the cat isn't 6 feet tall and evil looking. Anyways as I got older and the discussion came up again, my mother said she saw the same thing that night and just didn't want to frighten me. I still get goosebumps to this day telling the story, but haven't seen anything like it since. Sleep well.",nosleep,jjhunny,/r/nosleep/comments/dtqja/the_chair_ghost/
75,The Armoire,1287552991,"Hey there /nosleep. First of all, I discovered this lovely little subreddit a few days ago, and I'm in full-on love/hate mode for it now. I can't stop reading, BUT I WANT TO SO BADLY.

Anywho, I thought I'd share a story that's been in my family for a while. For some reason, my family is prone to run-ins with the supernatural (especially my mother, but we'll get into that later). This story is related to my aunt, who doesn't normally believe in things like this - but this particular instance hit a little too close to home.

I come from a very small town, the kind where everyone knows everyone else. Therefore, when a family friend, David, decided that he was moving away and was going to sell most of his things, the community heard about it quickly. David had a yard sale, and within a few hours he had sold most of his worldly possessions. My aunt Sarah, who had been helping with the yard sale, grabbed a few tables from the lawn to move them into David's garage.

In the garage was David's truck, and in the back of the truck was the most beautiful armoire wardrobe that my aunt had ever seen.

""David,"" she called, ""what are you doing with this armoire?""

David came into the garage. ""Oh, you found that thing. Well, I'm getting rid of it.""

""What? How could you get rid of something like that? It's an antique! How much do you want for it?""

""Nothing. You don't want it. I'm getting rid of it. Today.""

Being a stubborn person, my aunt began getting upset. ""David. You will NOT be getting rid of that armoire. It's in your truck already, right? Well you're going to take it to my house. I'll sell it for you, if I don't decide I want to keep it for myself.""

""You DON'T WANT it, Sarah. It's haunted.""

Like I said before, my aunt didn't believe in things like that. ""That's bullshit, David. I'll bet that armoire is at least a hundred years old, and it's absolutely breathtaking. It could be worth more than the truck it's sitting in. You're taking it to my house right now, and you're not worrying about it anymore.""

David, realizing that nothing he said would dissuade my aunt, sighed. ""Alright Sarah, whatever you say. But I warned you.""

David drove the wardrobe over to my aunt's house, where he (with my aunt's help) loaded it inside. My aunt collected things like this, and therefore the house was decked from top to bottom with antiques. Everything had it's place, and the overall ""atmosphere"" of any one room couldn't be disrupted. She decided that she was going to put it in her daughter's room, where it was at least out of the view of visitors.

David left quickly, reminding my aunt that he'd be in town for at least another week getting everything squared away if she had any second thoughts. She assured him that she wouldn't, and waved goodbye as he sped out of the driveway.

My cousin, Rebecca, who was around 17 at the time, was surprised when she found a new wardrobe in her room after school. My aunt told her that David had given it to them, and that it was staying in Becca's room until she could find a better place for it. Not thinking too much about the new addition, Becca went to bed that night as usual.

However, that night, at precisely 3:00am, Becca woke up. Her bed was against a wall, and she slept facing that wall often. Feeling groggy, she rolled over in her sleep. Next to the dresser, which was on the opposite side of the room, stood a little girl. This would normally have freaked Becca out a little bit (she DID believe in ghosts, as opposed to her mother), but the little girl looked happy. The room felt calm, and as soon as Becca blinked, the little girl was gone. Becca went right back to sleep.

At this point, Becca really didn't think too much about the whole incident. She felt like it was a dream, one she remembered oddly well, but that was it.

The next night, nothing out of the ordinary happened. Becca slept soundly throughout the night. The night after that, however, things began to get weird.

Becca woke up, at 3:00am again, facing the wall as she was earlier. The room felt oddly quiet, and when she rolled over, Becca was briefly confused. The wardrobe was tilted slightly, more towards her. Then she saw the little girl again. She was no longer on the opposite side of the room, but in the very center. Gone was the look of happiness, replaced by one of annoyance. She was looking directly at Becca, and Becca began to feel uncomfortable. However, when she blinked, the little girl disappeared again. Becca went back to sleep, but not before covering her head in her sheets for a little while.

That morning, Becca was fairly certain what she was experiencing wasn't a dream. She told my aunt about what had happened the night before, and asked if there was something up with the wardrobe. My aunt, getting angry, asked if she had talked to David about the wardrobe at all, to which Becca confusedly replied that she hadn't seen David at all since he started his move. 

My aunt sent Becca off to school, and called David.

""What have you been telling Rebecca about that armoire, David?""

David sounded a little anxious. ""What? What are you talking about?""

""Rebecca's going on about the armoire having a little girl in it, or something. Do you want it back David? There's no need to form a conspiracy with my daughter to get it again.""

""Sarah, look. There's something WRONG about that wardrobe. You need to take it to the dump, or throw it in the river, or SOMETHING. There's something fucking wrong with it.""

""Look, I don't know what you've been telling Rebecca, but stop it. I've already got some buyers interested, and it'll be out of our hair soon enough.""

David sighed again. ""Alright. If you think you know what you're doing.""

""I do, David. Goodbye.""

That night, like the second night, nothing happened. When my aunt asked Becca about it in the morning, Becca replied that she slept soundly. My aunt took this as an assurance that nothing was wrong.

However, when Becca went to bed on the fifth night, things changed again. She had bad dreams that night, dreams she wouldn't tell me about even today, when at 3:00am a sharp thud woke her up. She faced the wall again, and never before in her life had she felt dread like she did right then. Every part of her told her not to roll over, not to look at the wardrobe, but there was absolutely no way she was going back to sleep, and she couldn't lay there all night.

When she rolled over, she first saw what had made the thud. The wardrobe had fallen over on its front, and was in the center of the room. On top of the wardrobe was the little girl, only she was facing away from Becca this time. She slowly began to turn around, and when Becca saw this she quickly blinked her eyes, hoping she'd disappear like before.

The little girl was now inches away from Becca's face, looking directly at her. Her face was contorted into an expression of pure rage, and she was screaming.

Becca reeled back and threw her covers forward. The little girl vanished, and Becca took this opportunity to sprint out of her room into her parents', where she jumped on the bed, sobbing.

My aunt wasn't so skeptical this time around. When she saw the overturned wardrobe in Becca's room, it slowly dawned on her that her daughter couldn't possibly have knocked it over and pushed it into the center of the room on her own. They called David that night. He quietly loaded it onto the truck, told Becca he'd throw it into a woodchipper, and drove off.

79,The Ghost Car That Followed Us Home,1287536599,"Yo. Long time Redditor, first time submitter here.

The following is a totally true story, which I thought would be interesting to some of the /nosleepers. 

Some context; this happened quite a few years ago now, in 1998. I was seven years old at the time. I lived in a town the middle of rural Wales (in the UK), and we had lots of country backroads (in the UK style with tall hedgerows to either side) leading to home. 

I barely remember the incidents that happened here, so most of what is said is told from what my parents have told me over the years.

It all starts on a late Autumn night. My mother, father, me, and my grandmother, were returning home from some picnic day-out we used to go on, to a quiet beauty spot about an hour and a half drive over (mostly) rural roads. It was very dark, approaching 8pm, and it had clouded over; so the county backroad was completely devoid of illumination apart from the car headlights. We're driving pretty slow. I was asleep in the back, cuddled up to my gran, while my parents are in the front with the radio quietly on.

Suddenly, my mother notices something very odd in the wing-mirror of her passenger seat. The tail lights are reflecting in _something_ behind the car. My mother is one of those people who will always point out anything odd, interesting, or unusual, straight away, to whoever is present, so immediately tells my father that she thinks something is following them. He glances out of his mirror, and sees nothing. But my mother is insistent that there is something is being reflected behind them. 

My grandmother, who has been listening in, now chips in and agrees with my mother that she can also see something in the back window. My father still tries to tell them that they are wrong, its impossible; and that he's trying to drive and would they kindly be quiet. 

A few minutes pass. And then, my mother, shouts out; ""Look! It's a registration plate!"". Behind our car, only a few inches from the back bumper; is the outlines of a vehicle registration plate reflected in our taillights. There's a car following us; totally devoid of any lights. My mother begins to panic (hell, I don't blame her), my father still can't see a thing and is beginning to get aggravated at the entire situation, and I wake up and wonder WTF is going on. Everyone is talking at once, my mother seems to be getting hysterical, my grandmother trying to calm her down and my father attempting to provide a rational explanation. He thinks it could be a trick of the light or an optical illusion of some sort. I proceed to wind down the window (though it only goes down half way for safety) and poke my head out and look. Apparently (for, I don't remember this), I exclaim that I can see the outlines of tyre arches and can hear another car over the wind and the sound of our engine. 

Mother begins to panic again, and starts jumping to all sorts of awful conclusions (that its a stolen car full of criminals, that its IRA terrorists, all sorts). Through this commotion, we miss the turning we needed to get back to our town. My father, totally exasperated, slows down making for a gate in which he can turn the car around in. I look back and see I can no longer see the outline of any car. Everyone goes silent as we begin to execute a three point turn. The headlights flash around and illuminate..nothing. The road is empty behind us. There was no way any car could have gotten past us without us knowing, and there was nowhere else for a car to go, as high and thick edges blocked us in on either side. My father, smug that he was right and there really wasn't a car, continues down the right road for home.

About 15 minutes pass, in which no one really does or says anything to each other. I keep on turning around in my seat looking out the back window for any sign of the car. By this time, some of the clouds have begun to part, and the surroundings are, if not visible, are discernible by just my eyes. And then, I see it again. A car, definitely a car, quietly pulls up behind us. It's close, very close. Our white taillights are shining off of its registration plate and the chrome around the engine. I can just about make out the the edges of the windscreen. But nothing else. It's not some sort of reflection of our own car; its a totally different type. I can't see into the car itself. 

I quietly whisper to my grandmother what I can see, and she turns around, and then quietly suggests to my parents to do the same. My mother goes dead still; you can tell she is really very frightened now. My father exclaims in surprise, as he can now see it too. We all begin to debate what to do. My father and grandmother want to stop at the nearest farm we come too, but my mother absolutely forbids him and just wants to get home as soon as possible. I'm keeping a constant vigil on the car behind us. After a while we all agree to just keep driving until we get to the next town, which should be fairly soon. Minutes go by. The car behind us stays with us, only about a metre away. Keeping up with our pace. Not dropping back, not coming any nearer. Everyone is pretty much silent by this point. Nothing happens for a while, until we begin to near the lights of the next town. Suddenly, I see the car accelerate forward, almost hitting us. My father, who has also been keeping an eye, shouts out, and accelerates to compensate, while my mother lets out a brief shriek and my grandmother holds me tight. We're now having to go uncomfortably fast for the road conditions, but the car behind us has stopped accelerating. We whip around the corner onto a road with (thankfully) street lights, and the outskirts of the small town. Everyone looks behind us. There's nothing there. The car that was within touching distance of our car has gone. Vanished. Everyone is speechless; there is no way the car could have turned off, nowhere for it to go. 

The rest of the journey goes by totally uneventfully. We soon turn onto a road with semi-regular streetlights. I keep on clamoring and asking questions, expecting one of the adults to explain to me what the hell just happened. No one can give me an answer. And we still can't, to this day, explain the events of that night.",nosleep,NervousEnergy,/r/nosleep/comments/dtlq3/the_ghost_car_that_followed_us_home/

84,i did not want to get out of bed this morning.,1287503879,"i had a very peculiar dream in the predawn hours this morning that is still bothering me a little bit.  i spent the majority of yesterday reading r/nosleep, catching up all the flood over stories from the weekend about doppelgangers, demons, and things hiding under the bed.  well, i think it all caught up with me last night.  this is seriously only about the third time r/nosleep has followed through on its promise for me.

i had a very late night sunday night, and awoke monday morning about half drunk, half hungover, and entirely unwilling to start my day.  but the bills have to be paid, so i drag my ass out of bed, dress, and stumble my way on to work.  it was a typical boring day, i spent most of my day on reddit, just counting the hours until i could get home and recoup my lost sleep from the prior night.  i have just started working out again, and its taking a while to adjust myself to the rest of my schedule after working.  depsite not feeling well, i put in a little extra time at the gym, and it felt good to burn some of the weekend's booze out of my system, and get back to the parents house to grab a small bite to eat before heading home, hopping in the shower, then hitting the hay a little early.  as soon as i reach my house i make my first mistake.

as i was tired, but not especially sleepy, i decided to take a melatonin to help put me to bed.  i usually do this when my sleeping pattern gets disrupted, by unusual dreams or whatever.  now, melatonin usually gives me very strange dreams and wakes me up sharp after about 6 hours of sleep on the first night that i take.  ill take it two or 3 more nights to recorrect myself, then lay off it for a while.  after the dream last night i believe i may just forgo the rest of my schedule.

i passed out from my supplement induced haze around 10:30, and proceeded to have strange dreams all night.  i dont remember the first set, but i do know i was awoken with a start around 3:30(which is usually when i wake up when my sleeping is shit.  it will happen for weeks on end that i wake at the same time every night, and fight to get my remaining 3 hours of sleep) and had a strange feeling.  not sure what it was, but just that something in my house didnt feel right at the moment.  but i force myself to ignore it, turn on some soothing piano music on my cd player, and quickly fall asleep.

the next dream, i do remember.  i dreamed that i was locked in a house, my house apparently, though not the one i live in.  and apparently i was not alone.  there was another being causing mischief, throwing stuff at me, breaking stuff, but i never could see him. he would dart out of the corner of my eye as i would look, right after having my head nearly taken off by a book.  as the day progressed, though, the thing became more aggressive, angry, and evil. i dreamed nearly a full day of living in those conditions, and stressed to exhaustion, finally called it a night and retired to my bedroom.  this time, it was *my* bedroom, right down to the bedsheets.  as i lay down and closed, i was overcome by the most ominous feeling i have ever experienced.  i heard the door open, then close.  in my dream, i rationalized it as my real life brother or roommate checking in my room for something.  so i rolled over to see who came in my room.

what i saw was not my brother or roommate.  it was me.  well, not quite.  it was substantially shorter, maybe 4 foot tall.  he also had the most evil visage i could imagine, the darkest eyes that seemed to glow, cruel gnashing teeth, scars and dirt smudged the face.  his posture was hunched, and nothing about his physiology appeared to be bilateral.  all the proportions were uneven.  i knew this thing was malevolent.  it had come into my room for me.

i feigned sleep, as i watched this thing creep across my room and stand at the side of my bed.  he sat there and watched me for an eternity.  finally, he kneels down below the edge of my bed. i can hear him shuffling as though he is sliding underneath my bed. i feel the bed being tussled.  as soon as he is still, i look at the clock.  6:34.  my alarm goes off in one minute.

my alarm sounds.  i swear that i am already awake, that i knew the alarm was about to go off.  slowly i reach my hand to the bedside and shut of the alarm.  i sit up in bed, stretch, throw back the covers, and then debate calling in sick.  i have never been more afraid to put my foot on the floor.

85,"Hey Reddits, this is my first nosleep post, about UFOs in my area (""news"" link inside) and various experiences from my neighbors.",1287501970,"First of all, I have not seen any of this activity.  I don't spend a lot of time outside at night!  I've been obsessed with UFOs and the paranormal all my life but have never experienced anything and always lean towards the simplest explanation being the right one.  I live out in the country in Virginia, and being a recent transplant from the city it took me a while to get used to the darkness and isolation.  Most folk out here have lived here all their lives and they are quite intelligent, although there are some ""redneck"" stereotypes that spin yarns and are full of shit out their ears.  Getting to that in a minute.


I started hearing about UFO activity at the beginning of the summer from my mom and her boyfriend, who is the aforementioned stereotype.  They always see this stuff when they are drunk and high on shrooms, so I never pay attention to them, even though they always swear that there is the token sober guy in the group who saw it too.  Riiight.  Anyways, there was a supposed UFO flap over 2 weeks that culminated in a pretty unbelievable story:  while we were in DC for a wedding, my mom's boyfriend called us to tell us that around midnight the night before, they were standing around when two giant beams of light, one after the other, lit up the field and the power went out.  Supposedly other folk besides that group saw it and several were sober, but I'm still pretty skeptical-- that's a pretty intense event to have happen and not make the rounds or the paper.

Moving on to a different group, place, experience:  There were [reports of UFO activity over a town 30 minutes away](http://ufodisclosed.com/ufo-sighting-over-culpeper-county-virginia).  This happened over the summer, but 2 weeks ago at least 10 of my neighbors (the majority who do not drink or smoke) saw something very similar to the description.  They say they saw this over 2 hours in 3 different locations, and they were able to view one of them through a telescope.  This is a description from one of the neighbors: 

""I found this article that had been reported &amp; witnessed in Culpeper this past July. This is the best description I've found to explain what the hell the seven of us witnessed last night. There were three lights that formed a triangle type, but there were in three different locations at the same time. They moved up, down, side to side, zig zags &amp; at times we saw streaks of light fly into the brightest one. Tried to get pics but my camera wouldn't take the damn things.
Totally freaky!""

Apparently they have seen this several nights since, and my younger sister saw them one of the nights.  She was very freaked out.  Although I don't particularly want to see any of this, I'm not that disturbed by it.  I'm positive that it's military aircraft they're seeing.  We live smack in the middle of secret gov't central (being 2 hrs from both DC and Quantico) and they do military aircraft training in our area.

I'd love some thoughts and UFO experiences from others!",nosleep,mmmbot,/r/nosleep/comments/dtcub/hey_reddits_this_is_my_first_nosleep_post_about/
86,I KNOW I was awake.,1287482677,"This is something I've remembered since I was around 10 years old, when it happened almost 20 years ago.  When I was young I used to get very frequent nightmares and after awhile I started pinching myself to make sure I was awake when the nightmare would end.  

I had just awoken from one of my frequent nightmares and pinched myself and could just TELL I was awake.  Being young I did what I usually did...walked down the hallway and into my parents room and slept on the blanket on the floor.  However, this particular night I made it half way down the hall and suddenly become immobilized in what felt like an invisible spider web.  

I was horrified and completely paralyzed but when the voice began to speak non-sensical words downstairs...thats when I became truly terrified.  It lasted maybe two minutes and I awoke the next morning in bed but fully remembering my ordeal from the night before.  Nothing like it has happened since but I'll never forget it.

88,"Not exactly sure how to title this..Halloween experiences in a cemetery?? Hell, I don't know..",1287474339,"First off, this story still gives me goosebumps to this day, and I will probably get them multiple times while typing this. I did not sleep well for weeks after this happened, and I am still scared to go anywhere near the cemetery this took place in. This story happened Halloween night of 2008, I believe. It was getting late, about 11pm, I had school the next day so my mom didn't want to keep me out too late. She decided she wanted to go a cemetery for Halloween. I was fine with it and pretty psyched to go, although I never anticipated anything actually happening.

My mother, sister, and I left my house around 9:30. We arrived at a cemetery at around 9:45ish. It wasn't far from my house. It was a small cemetery off of a backroad so there weren't any people around. My mom had a video camera and a digital camera to record any voice clips we could have captured and take pictures of what was going on. She asked multiple questions and we had no indication that there was anything there, so we left.

We arrived at the second cemetery later, it was a good 30-45 mins from where I lived. In the middle of nowhere. My great grandmother lives about 1/2 a mile from this cemetery. When we pulled up I got this very creepy feeling as if I was being watched. Upon exiting the car, something fell out of the trees behind us, I screamed so loud people probably could have heard me from miles away.

We entered the cemetery and set up our cameras and a bell. My mother got a stand out of our garden and brought it with us and attached a bell to it. She pushed it into the ground and made sure it was firmly in place. To be sure the wind couldn't knock it over, she shook it. There was no way the wind was taking it down.

My mother is a strong believer that she can talk to the spirits and that if you ask them questions they will talk back. She spent a few minutes walking around reading tombstones and seeing the names and ages of the people who died. We came across this family, a mother and her young children. My mother was asking the mother what had happened. She had figured they had died from some kind of illness since their deaths were so close together. These were old graves, from the early 1900's. 

My sister was recording on the camera and I was sticking really close to my mother(didn't want anything to attack me haha). My mom was asking the woman to give us a sign that she was with us. When she said that a very faint ringing started occuring. The bell was moving as if someone were barely touching it. This freaked me out majorly. I still wasn't sure if it was really a ghost doing it, or if maybe there was a little breeze that moved the bell. I was very skeptical, until my mother stated once more, ""Come ring our bell, let us know you are here"". It was at this point that the bell started swaying back and forth and eventually hit the ground. 

I was horrified. By this time I was crying. I just wanted to go. I was still fairly young, and I was so scared. I ran to the car and locked all the doors. My mother then reminded me that a couple of locked doors won't stop the ghost from getting me. I was out of that car and standing beside her so fast, I had never been that clingy in my life. I wouldn't leave her side.

Of course, my mother wasn't satisfied with the result she had gotten, so she decided to continue to ask the woman to show us a sign that she was there. This time my mother made sure the bell stand was in the ground 4 or 5 inches, surely it wasn't going anywhere... WRONG! She asked and the lady delivered. I think this actually freaked my mom out as well. The bell started shaking violenty and hit the ground again. My sister and I both had tears streaming down our faces. My mother was laughing at us. She thought it was awesome that she was actually getting feedback from this ghost.    

My mother asked the woman a lot of questions about how she died, and asked if her kids wanted to come play with us and that we wouldn't harm them. You could not see any of these ghosts, but you could feel them. It was a cold night, and this just gave you a creepy as hell feeling. The bell rang a lot and you could hear a distant giggling from the children playing. 

My sister was recording all of it the whole time and I was taking pictures with the camera. I got multiple pictures with orbs in them, but no full figure prescences. My sister, being the smart one she is, never took off the freaking lense cap, so all we have is the audio. Definitely something to laugh at hearing our girly screams and my sassy ""I am getting in the car, you can not make me stay here"" reaction to the bell falling the first time. 

That was by far the creepiest experience of my life. I was skeptical that life after death existed until that night, now I have no doubt in my mind about it. Along with the events that have happened since, I will never ever second guess the power of the non-living.

89,One night at the boarding school,1287467491,"Excuse my English, it is my second language. This story takes place in the province of Franche-Comté, France.

After an awful year of slacking at the local high-school, spending most of my time hacking in the computer labs, I decided to get serious and learn electronics in the capital of my home province. I registered in a boarding school for the last two years leading to my diploma.

My hometown is about an hour away from Besançon, the capital. My father would drive me every Sunday night where I would spend the night with a few other students. Saint-Joseph is the name of the dormitory, it is a massive building from the mid-19th century, built to host a thousand kids and was maintained by friars.

While there was plans to renovate the dorms, my entire floor was long and opened, had extremely high ceilings and ten times four beds separated by thin wood panels. The paint was falling in places, we had old windows on one side, if felt like this place remained the same for half a century.

During the week, you hang out with your friends, you study, you forget where you are and it goes by very fast, during the weekend you see your friends and family. Then comes the time to go back, during the entire ride you hope that you won't be alone.

After a few months it finally happened, I was the only loser dropped off at the boarding school on a Sunday night. It was winter, it was freezing and after the guardian opened the gate for me, he took off and I was left alone. I quickly climbed the stairs to my floor, lit all the lights, checked all the doors, all the beds, all the windows. Every single one of my steps was echoed across the entire floor, running the water for a second would cause the pipes to creak for what felt like an eternity.

When you know you are alone in such a place, you never feel quite alone. After scrutinizing everything, I turned off the lights from both ends, got to my bed in the middle of the floor and tried to relax reading a book with my headlight. Maybe the batteries ran out because when I woke up, it was dark. I had no idea why I woke up, my eyes were wide opened, I was panicked and couldn't find a source of light when I heard it. Steps, someone was slowly stomping its way up the east staircase. Lying in bed, petrified, the door was not in sight. When the steps got to my floor it stopped. The door was unlocked. Instead of opening the door, it started to pound, first slowly then faster to a point when it felt like a dozen people were behind the door. The sound was going through my bones, the echo in the empty floor was unbearable and right when I was about to lose it, it stopped.

I couldn't move, I was scared to death and barely able to think, I was hoping that whatever was hitting the doors did not cross it. Then the steps began again, but from the west stairs! The same exact pace, the same stop in front of the door and a long silence. It felt like I said my prayers a dozen times. There was no way someone crossed the entire building, I would have heard it. I nearly screamed when the pounding began again. When it attained its culminating point, it sounded like white noise. I was so terrified I think I started passing out, some white and cold light filled the entire floor and... that's all I remember.

I woke up the next morning with the worst headache. I tried to investigate if anything happened in this building in the past but could never get anything from the administration. The building is still standing, still used as a boarding school, you can see a picture of the front [here](http://www.stjoseph-stpaul.org/~lepstjo/).

90,"""It's nothing, go back to sleep""",1287465934,"Things haven't been the same since we moved into our new place.  I haven't felt quite at home, as if I am somewhere I don't belong.  When I am home alone, I can’t help but feel like there is something watching me, waiting and wanting for me to leave.  I am getting ahead of myself though.  About 5 months ago, my girlfriend and I decided to move in together.  We looked at a bunch of places and each settled on one we liked.  My ideal place was set back in a little wooded subdivision, in a basement apartment.  Hers was at a newer building in a downtown suburb.  We flipped a coin and she won.

On move-in day, we loaded up the U-Haul and set off for our new home.  It was a scorcher that day, 92 degrees with the sun beating down on us.  I had grabbed what I could carry and went up to the apartment to unlock and prop open the door.  When I tried to open the door, it felt as if something was holding it shut from the other side, but a little hip-check and it swung right open.  I made a mental note to fix it, propped it open, and went down to start unloading our stuff.  After a few hours we had everything all unpacked and it was time to return the truck.  I locked up, got into the driver’s seat and set off to get my deposit back.

When we got back from the rental place, I went upstairs to get my checkbook to pay the first month’s rent and finish paperwork.  When I unlocked the door, it wouldn’t open again and I chided myself for not fixing it when I unpacked my tools.  Once more I pushed into the door with my hip and it swung open.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what looked like a little boy dodge into the bathroom area.  I thought maybe it was the heat playing games with me but I did a once over of the apartment just to be sure…nothing there.

That was only the first of what would be many troublesome occurrences in our new place.  Many of you may remember my story about [Herbert]( http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bty2y/herbert/), however I don’t think this is him.  I haven’t seen him much since the time I shared that story with /r/nosleep.  This is something different…something new.  One night, while sleeping soundly cuddling close to the one I love so dearly, I heard what sounded like someone trying to open the sliding door on the balcony.  It alarmed me because we live on the second floor.  I woke up Katie and asked her if she heard anything.  She sighed and said “it’s nothing, go back to sleep.”  I was still shaken but I rolled over and huddled closer, slowly drifting back to dream-land.

A few weeks went by with not much to mention, just some misplaced items and cabinets being open.  Then again, at around 3am, I am woken by the sound of the sliding door on the balcony.  This time I can hear a faint sound along with it, almost like a grunt.  I wake Katie up again and ask her if she heard anything.  Again she replies “it’s nothing, go back to sleep.”  I can’t just roll over and fall asleep again.  My inquisitive mind needs to know what the hell is going on.  I grabbed my 9mm out of the nightstand and put on some boxers (it would be embarrassing to hold someone at bay with a gun in the nude, no?) and made my way into the living room.  I strained my eyes in the dark to see what, if anything, was out there.  I was trying so hard to see what was *outside* that I failed to notice the vertical blinds were slowly swaying.  Feeling fairly certain nothing was out there, I made sure the sliding door was locked and closed the blinds. I brushed it off as mind games or bad dreams from being in a new and unfamiliar place.  

The next month or so was normal.  All was quiet throughout the nights and I slept like a baby.  That was until last week.  Right around 3am, I was woken up by that noise again.  This time it seemed more frantic and urgent.  I nudged Katie and before I could finish my question she said “it’s nothing, go back to sleep.”  But there was no way that was happening.  Once again I throw on some boxers and grab my gun.  This time I was prepared and had been keeping a flashlight next to my bed, so I grabbed that as well.  Before I even made it out the bedroom door I saw the same shadowy figure I saw when we first moved in.  It darted from the living room towards the kitchen.  I quickly flicked on my Maglite and pulled the slide back on my Glock 17…seemingly in one motion.  It was on, and this thing was going down. 

 I made my way into the kitchen, nearly crushing my cat.  Every cabinet was wide open, every drawer pulled out and spilled on the floor.  Why didn’t this wake me up?  There it was, the sliding door noise again.  I spun around to go into the living room and catch whatever it was making all the noise.  I could see something moving outside between the cracks in the blinds.  I could hear something pounding on the glass door, pulling hard trying to get in.  I called out to Katie to get her up in case we had to run.  She didn’t respond.  I flashed the light into the bedroom to make sure she was ok.  I saw her form under the sheets of the bed and told myself she’s fine.  

The pounding was getting louder and more frantic.  Whatever was out there was going to either break the glass or pull the door right off its track.  I was sweating, shaking, and I felt like physically sick.  The tension was mounting and I yelled out “I have a gun!”  But the pounding and pulling didn’t stop.  I decided to put an end to this and I went toward the sliding door to pull open the blinds.  I took a deep breath, pulled on the cord, and the blinds swung open.  To my horror I saw Katie standing on the balcony, desperately trying to get into the apartment!  She was banging on the door and pointing behind me.  I froze.  Suddenly I felt an icy touch on my shoulders and a voice whispered “it’s nothing, go back to sleep.”

91,"I have been reading about a bunch of negative stories, here is a positive one for all your redditors.(kinda long)",1287462638,"About 2 years ago, two of my mother's clients passed away. They were both in their 80's. The man had dementia, I think the woman died from old age. They had been married for over 50 years. She passed away, and then he did 9 days later on his wife's birthday.  My mother took care of them for 3 or 4 years and became close with their son.  When they were gone my mother helped out with getting everything ready for the estate sale.

There was this particular item in a cabinet, it is one of those hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil things. The woman my mother watched over thought it was ugly and always kept it hidden in the back of that cabinet. Once they died it somehow got moved to the front of that cabinet. My mom thought maybe the son had moved it around so she asked him about it, and he said he hadn't seen it in years. She moved it back to the back of the cabinet where it had been for so long.  The next day she returned and it was in the front of the cabinet again.

She couldn't figure out what was going on, but she knew weird stuff had happened in that house before. One day my sister and I were sitting in the sunroom at night, it was probably around 9:30 or 10pm. We heard a thump on the tin roof which scared us at first, but we figured it was just something falling from a tree. A few minutes later we heard a knocking on the window. We figured it was our mother outside trying to freak us out so we thought nothing of it.  Now these are full glass windows, ceiling to floor. We heard the knocking again, there wasn't anyone outside that we could see. We jumped up and ran through the house screaming for my mom. She was in the garage smoking since you couldn't smoke in the house. We were telling her what happened and she assured us it wasn't her.  She found it humorous that we were so scared. She walked around outside and there was nobody there. I noticed my ankle was hurting. I looked down and realized I had what looked like a burn mark. To this day, I  have a scar on my ankle from whatever it was. 

We have also heard whispering voices in that house and seen an old man standing in the hallway in one of the mirrors. My mother has heard footsteps on the porch when she was smoking and the rocking chair beside her would start rocking on it's own even when there was no breeze.

But back to what I was originally talking about. This item had been given to the couple from her uncle. His name is Uncle Fielding. My mother liked the item so she decided it would be a marvelous idea to bring it home with her. Ever since that day, Uncle Fielding has lived with me. He isn't mean, he is very nice actually.

I have never been very fond of the idea that I have a spirit following me around, but I guess the fact that he isn't evil helps. I believe that he protects me. He likes to make his prescence be known. He will knock on walls, or move objects. He has even spoken a time or two. He has a very very deep manly voice. I have heard him say ""hey"" a few times. It is creepy, enough to make you tremble and raise every hair on your body. 

My mother thinks he has some kind of attraction to me. Out of everyone in my family, he picks me to follow. Maybe he thinks I need his guidance? I don't know. One day I was taking a shower, I heard a knocking on the wall which creeped me out. I hurried and finished my shower, I knocked one of the shampoo bottles into the bathtub as I was getting out but I was in too big of a hurry to pick it back up so I left it there. An hour or so had passed and I had completely forgotten about it, I heard a noise in the bathroom so my curiosity got the best of me and I went to find out what it was. My brother wasn't home so I knew it couldn't be him. I thought maybe it was one of my dogs or something. I went into the bathroom and noticed my shower curtain was closed, I NEVER close it because I have a fear someone is going to be hiding behind it with a knife ready to kill me or something. Not sure what I was thinking at the time, but I opened the curtain. The shampoo bottle was still in the bottom of the tub, only it was standing up now. My mother joked with me that he was just picking up after me.

I have moved out of my parent's house since then and moved into an apartment with two roommates. I warned them when we moved in that Uncle Fielding follows me around and that he might scare them, but he won't hurt them. He is a very friendly spirit, but if you aren't expecting it he can scare the shit out of you. 

Anytime I go into my bathroom and leave the door open he will close it while I am in there. If I am not in there he allows the door to be open, but as soon as I step foot in my bathroom he must close it. He also likes to turn on our kitchen sink by himself. It is quite funny seeing my roomies reaction when it comes on. Their eyes couldn't be open any wider. In my old house he lived in the kitchen, he would always knock on the walls when you entered it.  Now I think he lives in my laundry room, he loves making noises when it is completely silent in the apartment. I think he gets a kick outta it. 


TL;DR- A friendly spirit follows me around. He talks to me on occasion and likes to make sure everyone knows he is around, but he has never hurt me. He protects me.

92,A very unnerving story about my family that I was reminded about today...,1287461908,"* Well let me start off by saying that I don't know if I believe this or not. I've been told this story a few times in my early life, particularly when I stayed at the Grandparents house and they found me reading books about the paranormal. Anyways, I was out with my Aunt and Grandma today when we were talking about all of this business, and she brought it up again, but with a few new details I was apparently 'too young to hear' back then because of events that happened in my childhood too. I don't know what to make of it, but the story is what fuelled my passion for the paranormal, so I thought you may want to hear, too! (a sidenote is the ages and birthdates. We're a young family, and my mother had me in 1990 at the age of seventeen. I may still mix up dates though lol) *


This story goes all the way back to around 1955. Apparently my great aunt (audrey) was a lot like me when she was younger; inquisitive, curious and quite big on the occult, but my grandma hated it and always thought that nothing good could come from it. She obviously had no idea at the time how right she was.

 
One day my Audrey goes out and buys a ouija board, but quickly has it confiscated by my great gran who was terrified of such stuff because of an encounter she had when she was younger (apparently it runs in the family! though a story for another time). So Audrey sulks for a few days and eventually forgets all about it, being busy with school and such. 


A few weeks pass and Audrey is home alone with my Gran (Glynis). Needless to say, they found the ouija board and ended up in a massive tussle over wether it should be used or not, when they were strictly told never to touch it. Glynis stormed off and Audrey decided she would have a little fun with it. Nobody apart from Audrey knows what happened next (and she took it to her grave), but my gran says everything went completely silent in the house for an hour or two. After a good 2/3 hours, my gran gets worried that Audrey hasn't come to bed yet, so she goes to check on her. When she arrives in the front room she finds the furniture slightly askew and Audrey in the corner quietly sobbing to herself, but nothing was said about it after that night for another 20 years.


Time had passed, Audrey had settled down in a nice village called New Mills after spending the last 18 years studying art abroad and travelling. She managed to get a nice little house on a relatively busy country lane, but that's when it all started. 


She would apparently wake up during the night to strange whispers and sniffing noises at the foot of her bed. Every morning the picture frame of her and my gran when they were little that she kept on her dresser would be knocked over. She swore to god that there would be feet visible throught the crack under her door every single night, apparently ghostly white sometimes, stone grey other times. Then after a few weeks things started to pick up; The front door would be open in the morning, even though she locked it at night and the ceiling light in her room swung left to right all night long without stopping. It ended up getting so bad that she would ask my gran (now pregnant with my aunt) to stay with her whenever she could spare the days off work, but my gran never saw anything in her whole time there, but stuff was apparently happening still at night.


About a month before my aunt was born, Audrey was starting to get desperate, so she trawled antique stores and 'car boot sales' (as we call them here) for a new ouija board, so she could get to the bottom of it all. She managed to find one after a day or two and took it home, immediately using it when she got in, but this time she actually told my gran what happened when she used it. Apparently she immediately struck up questions such as ""who are you"" and ""what do you want from me"". Everytime she asked a question, the ouija board would only ever reply with ""1"".  After a few tries and no luck, she asks the 'spirit': ""Why wont you leave me alone?!"" and immediately the ouija  board springs into action without Audrey's hands being anywhere near it. It simply spells out the words ""Remember Me"". Immediately she runs out of the house and stays at the foot of her garden until my gran arrived, as she normally would do on that day. She consoled Audrey and finally got her to go back in with her after a good hour of trying. When she got in the house, my gran was visibly shocked to find the furniture scattered everywhere (some items in pieces) and a black shadow flick out of view just as they entered the living room. My gran and Audrey never went back to that house again, and sold it through an agent. 


I wish I could say this was the last of it, but it isn't anywhere near the end. Apparently, Audrey had to move another 4 times in a year and the thing seemed to be following her everytime she did. It managed to calm down, then stop altogether after a few years and many mental breakdowns later. The year is now around 1975 (I think) and my auntie Karen is just over 3 years old, with my mother being around 2. My gran finally mustered up the courage to take the two of them up to see Audrey at her new house (still in New Mills) because she had only ever seen them during their initial birth's and christening's. When she got there, she was greeted to a much healthier looking Audrey, who was finally recovering from the last 2 years events. They sat down, had a cup of tea and she talked to the children for a few hours, got to know them a little and such. A few hours later her new husband came home from work, greeted them and sat down in his favourite chair. The next few details are a little shakey, but apparently her husband went extremely pale in the face and told everyone to get out of the house because he saw somebody in the kitchen. As everybody ran out of the house the tables started slamming against the walls, the glass coffee table broke and the fireplace lit itself. In an obviously massive scene of chaos, my gran realises she left the two kids asleep in their trolly's in the house. As she goes back in to get them, everything stops and thats the last they ever hear of whatever it was again. Unfortunately, Audrey died in a mental institute due to the stress of the encounters and the toll they took on her mind a good 20 years later.


Around 2 years later my mother starts complaining about a man that stands in the corner of her room looking at her, just smiling (but she doesn't remember it at all). It doesn't go away for a few years and my mother has to go for several psych evaluations and suffers many mental breakdowns at its hands (which she does remember).


When I turned 3, I apparently complained about the same man, just staring and smiling, which apparently sent my mother into hysterics because of what she was told happened to her years earlier. The thing is, I'm yet to see him again...

94,The Creature in the Window,1287454870,"Friend linked this story to me from 4chan last night. Couldn't find the original post so here's the story, enjoy:

I'm pretty freaked out.
That thing has been there for almost a week. The figure in the window. It looks featureless, only skin on a human frame, and it's pressing itself against the glass somehow. I don't know how it got there, and I don't know how to get rid of it.

At first I thought it was a prank, a doll or mannequin that some jerks put there to scare me. But I realized as I walked out of my house to pull it away... it wasn't there. I shrugged it off, thinking that someone had hidden it while I was walking through my door. But I went back in and looked out that same window, and it was looking in, staring at me. I walked around my house, yelling for whoever it was to come out, but no one was there.

The thing is completely hairless, and it didn't look like it actually had eyes, or even a face at all. But its head is turned towards me when I enter the room. When I sit on my computer, I can feel its stare boring into my neck. But when I turn around, it's innocently turned in a different direction.

Finally on Thursday I tried to open the window, but it's stuck. I think the thing's hands are keeping it down. But I got a good look at its face. Its eyes and mouth are behind the skin, pushing outward. It stared at me, smiling.

Of course, I screamed.
I smashed my fist against the glass, determined once and for all to get rid of the glaring monster. I know I’m strong enough. That glass should’ve cracked.
But it didn’t.
It shuddered under my hand, but it didn’t break. And that smile just got wider and wider and wider, until I thought its head would break in half. It raised its own hand and bashed the window with its palm. It was mocking me. But I saw the faintest crack begin to appear where it had hit, and I backed away.
No way did I want that smile in the same room as me.

So I got a roll of duct tape, and I started covering the window. I couldn’t look directly at it; it was terrifying just knowing it was watching me. But I couldn’t help it. I took a quick glance at that face. A small peek.

It was angry.

That grin was now a large frown full of teeth. The skin had ripped away from its mouth. A menacing rumble started to fill the house. I pulled down the duct tape. The rumble stopped, the skin healed over, and it began to smile again.

Now it’s night, and the noise hasn’t started again. There are no sounds, no rumble, no crackling glass. Everything’s quiet now.

But I can feel its claws gripping the back of my chair. I can hear its skin stretching as it smiles.

It’s watching me type.",nosleep,panicking_man,/r/nosleep/comments/dt485/the_creature_in_the_window/

99,Vague Memories of Going Insane,1287440121,"There's a weird feeling I get, that seems like a false recollection, but it is always there, nagging me.

I've led a pretty unexciting live until middle age or so; but it was memorable to me, with clear milestones and memories in my past.  Full continuity.  No gaps in time...

However, I frequently have this sensation that I have had a spell in my past, where I have got batshit insane, sitting, crying, lonely in a straight jacket, institutionalized.  And I somehow pulled through to the other side, to where I am today.

As mentioned, I have a clear memory of my past.  There is no gap in time, where I could have had such a break down, and to have buried most memories of it.  I was always with a wife/girlfriend during these times, and there's no indications from them that I was through such a thing.  (Although I haven't actually asked.)

I think this feeling may have originated in a dream.  If so, that can explain why it does seem a bit unreal.  

On the other hand, this thought reoccurs to me more and more these days, to the point where it could become an obsession.

It's likely just a dream, influence from some movie I've seen, or something along those lines.

0,"I fell like my house is haunted, but possibly not ""evil"". Pics included",1287436297,"Crap, I didn't notice I misspelled ""feel"" in the title. Sorry guys.

First, I would like to explain several things such as history and descriptions of the room.

The house I live in now has been my residence for about 11+ years. I'm 19 and still live with my parents. I was allowed to ""move"" my room to the basement 4 - 5 years ago. Before that, the basement was a play area for me in my younger years. Legos, toys, etc. 

It's generally cold, since the basement is built underground like most. When at the top of the stairs leading to the basement, it's warmer. As soon as you hit the bottom of the stairs, it's cold. Now when you hit the bottom of the stairs, at the immediate left is a door that leads a large storage area where the furnace is also located. The floor is concrete and there are two separate fluorescent lights which when both turned on light up the entire area brightly. The crawlspace entrance is located in this room as well, which is boarded up and sealed so none of the cold air from outside gets into the house.

The immediate right leads you to the actual basement area. It's carpeted and well furnished: a pool table, reclining chair, television, small sliding storage closets for toys and board games etc (right now my bed and desk with computers are located here). 

Now what gives me the idea that this house may have another resident besides my parents is when I was younger still playing with Legos, I would put some on the floor and table and leave it there when I wasn't playing with them. If I quit for the rest of the day, I would wake up in the morning and some of the piles of Legos or even individual pieces would be moved or spread out, in places that I *knew* I didn't put them in. Since I was young, I never really thought about it much, caught deep into my own imagination. It was when I got older that I thought about it more. 

When anywhere in the house, I feel like *something* is there near me. There are three places where it is the worst: the kitchen, the basement, and the very top of the stairs for the top floor of the house. If I even just stand at the bottom of the stairs that leads to the top floor and look up, I can feel it. It does creep me out, but if I'm somewhere else it doesn't really bother me. Although when going up or down the stairs, I somehow get really freaked out and either turn all the lights on or dart as fast as I can up or down them; sometimes both. 

The other, most creepy thing that gives me the idea is something being written on the wall in the basement storage area. Yes, writing on the wall. It happened a year or so ago, but it wasn't until just now that I found this subreddit to share my story. 

I'm having mixed feelings about this writing, because it could have been some kids messing around while in the soon-to-be neighborhood in the unfinished houses. But the writing does not seem to be written with a finger or stick, because the lines are almost perfect. And it's what the two words are that makes it seem like it was something ""else"". 

The two words ""thank you"" are written on the wall. The wall is in the basement storage area, at the rear most wall (there are pics at the very end to help you visualize). 

I know this has not been there before, or since I moved in there. And why have my parents not noticed it? I know that if they did it would be washed off and gotten rid of forever. My father goes down there all the time to work out or do house work like in the crawlspace or putting things away. 

I do not think it's ""evil"" because I have never felt like I was being watched or not wanted, and nothing has been done directly to me (that I am aware of). I have not experienced anything whispering to me or touching me. So I'm wondering if it's possibly friendly.

Could this be ""something"" in the house or am I just freaking out over my imagination?

4,Bathtime,1287426344,"So this isn't my story, but one I have heard someplace.

Family move into an old vicarage (the house that a vicar lives in, usually next door to a church), the house hasn't been used for about 30 years and it is in need of severe repair.

The father of the family (a wife and a little girl) starts to get tradesmen in to knock down a couple of walls and install a new kitchen and bathroom.

One day he gets a call from a builder he has employed saying he has found some human remains in a partition wall, and what should he do?

The guy rings the estate agent who sold the property who advises him to ring the Police. The police take their time getting there and so the guy gets there first. The builder shows him a skull mounted above two leg bones sealed into the wall. There is a faded and rotten brown cassock at the bottom of the hole which the man reaches down to collect and it crumbles away in his hands.

The Police arrive with forensics and determine that the skull is at least 100 years old and tells the man to arrange to bury the material somewhere and think nothing more of it.

A couple of years later the little girl starts to ask about the 'brown man' she sees at the bottom of the garden, and occasionally the wife gets the impression someone is in the garden (where the remains were placed) watching into the house.

One day the man is in the bath and washing his hair, with his eyes closed to stop shampoo from getting in there, he reaches out for the towel to dry his head.

His fingers touch a rough material, and suddenly he remembers where he felt something like that before. He opens his eyes, soap suds run in and he only catches a glimpse before the pain of the shampoo makes him shut his eyes.

By the side of the bath stands an extremely tall man, dressed in the garb of a monk, wearing a heavy, coarse brown cassock, but there is no head on the figures shoulders.

The man shrieks, and leaps from the bath, slipping on the tiled floor he bangs his head and loses consciousness.

He comes to, after hearing his wife and daughter return from school. Still naked, he picks himself up and notices there are no towels on the rack at all.

He dresses quickly and races downstairs and without much of an explanation tells his family to get out of the house immediately, no questions.

As they drive down the lane away from the property the man notices the little girl waving what looks like an old dog blanket up in the rearview mirror.

'Eeew! - Daddy, whats this, it smells BAAD.' she says. The man looks and it is the cassock he found in the wall, complete with wet hand stains and soap scum from bathtime...",nosleep,syuk,/r/nosleep/comments/dsx0x/bathtime/

6,"Dearest Nosleep,",1287401961,"First, fuck you.  I found this place shortly before going to bed and of course read everything here.  My overactive imagination kicked into hyperdrive, I felt a bit foolish sprinting to bed after hitting the lights.

That said, I wanted to share something and get some input.  It's nothing intense, but it had me thinking.  I tossed and turned all night, the thoughts of not the paranormal reddits in my mind, but the crazy 'people at my window' reddits.  Those are the ones that really hit me.  To this day, a story I read as a child about how an elderly lady's hand hanging over her bedside is licked by her little dog to comfort her after hearing of an escaped lunatic in the area, only to find the dog in the bed, is the exact reason I do not hang anything over the bed.  I happened to read a similar story last night and that really got me going.

When I get up in the morning I do it in steps.  The alarm goes of about four times in an hour and then i'm up.  On the last time as I crawled back into bed and drifted away, I started dreaming.  I dreamed in some crazy black and white charcoal etching style and was being narrated by someone.  It was a man, maybe about five feet, stocky, long pointy nose.  Think The Penguin from Batman.  I was being told about how he kidnapped to young girls, very young, maybe 1 or 2.  They were twins I guess, all I could see where charcoal silhouettes.  He had taken them to some train tracks in the woods, tied them up and as if he didn't want to touch them anymore, used a pickaxe through the chest to lift and place one on each side of the tracks.  The creepy black  and white image is burned into my brain.  As the train pulled around a nearby bend, it cast a light on the girls but it was too late to stop.  The guy was nearby watching.  Back in real life, I started coming out of it about the time the train showed up, like I was lucid dreaming.  When the train rolled in I got a very deep chill.  As it rolled over the girls, I got the weirdest feeling, a chill that seemed to run through me, like it had a direction from toe to head, the same direction the train was moving.

I assume now that it was a reddit I read and forgot, explaining the style and the narrative.  Is this actually a thing?  Is it a reddit?  Can anyone shed some light on this or am I just insane?",nosleep,reasonman,/r/nosleep/comments/dsqzk/dearest_nosleep/

10,The Old Theater,1287363400,"Back when I was in high school, me and my friends were obsessed with going into places we knew we weren't supposed to (construction sites, abandoned buildings, etc). At one point, I started having an obsession with finding ways up onto the roofs of strip malls and checking to see if I could open the roof access doors. Eventually, I come upon an old theater that had gone bankrupt and was promptly shutdown, leaving it abandoned for several years. Upon climbing up to the roof and checking the access panel, me and my friend find it's unlocked and climb down the ladder to examine this exciting new space. 

The ladder let out into a hallway on the second floor right next to the projector room, which for some reason still has all the projectors and equipment used to operate them. The strange part is that the lights were still on in this room, but nowhere else. We chalk this up to us not being the first ones to explore the place and the power company forgetting to cut power off to the place (it was on a strip mall with operational stores), and proceed to look around. Now one end of hallway led to the stairs down into the main lobby area, while the other continued on into what I assume were the managerial offices. However, as we walk down this end, a terrible scent that smelled like rotting eggs became stronger and stronger. This creeps us out enough to decide to leave it alone for now and continue exploring the rest of the building. The entire place was a goldmine for us, as just about everything had been left just the way it was when it closed down, the popcorn, soda, and hotdog machines were still there, the furniture and decorations were all left untouched, even the movie posters hanging in the lobby were still there. We then leave for the night and inform our other friends of this amazing find. 

As the weeks go by, we make many more visits, bringing more and  more of our friends to check it out, but always leaving the mysterious hallway alone. The only way to let people in, however, is for one of us to climb up onto the roof, by means of a storm drain, enter through the roof access and open the back door to let everyone else in. Me being the most nimble climber, I was always the one to do this and every time I did, I always had the sensation that something was watching me. The fact that we would always go in well after dark to minimize the risk of getting caught didn't help either. So, whenever I hopped down the ladder into the dark hallway, I would book it down the stairs to the back door.

Anyways, one night, when all five of us are there, we decide that we have enough collective bravery to finally explore the mysterious hallway. We proceed up the stairs and down the hall, with me on point. As we proceed down the hall, we find nothing out of the ordinary in the adjoining offices except for the fact that the smell keeps getting stronger and stronger. Eventually we see a door at the end of the hallway that's just barely cracked open. As we get closer and closer to this, we notice that not only has the smell gotten almost unbearable, but the temperature has inexplicably dropped well below that outside. Then, just as I'm reaching for the door knob, it slowly and inexplicably swings open to reveal a small office with the words 'GET OUT' written in thick red smudges on the opposite wall, which we quickly decide is the best course of action. Walking back down the hallway, we suddenly hear the door slam shut, accompanied by a loud, mechanical click and a sudden drop in temperature to what felt like freezing, sending us all running for the back door. As we're running past the projector room, I notice that one of the projectors has suddenly turned on. Just as we're about to leave, curiosity overcomes my fear and I decide to pop into the theater the projector was connected to. On the screen I see, shaded in deep crimson, a picture of three people, a man, woman, and small child, kneeling in what I think was a backyard with all their heads scratched out.

After that night, none of us ever went back. A few even went so far as to avoid that entire strip mall altogether. The theater was demolished a few years later. I still to this day have no idea what it was we stumbled upon in there that night.

11,So I had an extremely lucid dream last night...,1287362488,"I don't quite know wether to add this to r/sleep or r/creepy, but you guys seem to prefer writing more lol

Basically I pretty much snapped in and out of sleep like it never happened last night. I was sat at my computer and the next thing I knew I was being hunted by something that scared the living shit out of me.

I will relay the dream I had back to you, but it will be in the format of a story, for added atmosphere. 

""I was alone in the woods when I finally encountered it. The playground myth I had laughed about was now stalking me through the mist, its fingers still dripping with the fresh blood of over fifteen children taken from a small village nearby. Its leathery skin could have once been as white as the ice which surrounded me, though now stained a deep red.  

I tried to contemplate the shape of its face, but no human could ever glimpse upon such a disgusting form and remain within the boundaries of sanity.  From what I could work out, the 'thing' stood around seven foot tall, its form nothing but bone and skin, with teeth as long as pencils and sharp as razors.  In my final moments among the living I remember seeing two soulless eyes, so twisted and horrifying they could not even be found in your darkest and most ferocious of nightmares. The final shards of my shattered mind screamed as it emitted its terrifying howl, and then everything vanished.  

Now I wait, tied to a wall within a small pit, void of any real notion of time and space. I know the thing will soon come back and devour me alive, just like all the other children over centuries before me, and the others yet to come for centuries after I'm gone.""

I essentially rewrote the dream I had in the format of a story to make it easier to describe and to read, but this is pretty much how it happened. It was so realistic that I woke up shivering and thinking I was trapped in a hole and something was trying to eat me. Near enough scared my girlfriend to death screaming lol

14,Weird Shit with my Roommate,1287360075,"I got home earlier and my roommate August was sitting in the living room, ripping the pages from this book that on the table in front of him.  Staring directly ahead his hands reached down at the top left of each page and he yanked and tore the page loose.  

""Hey,""I said.

Rip. Rip. Rip.

I shrugged it off and beelined to my room, since I had to study.  I don't really know him that well, but I know he's an art student and takes adderol, so he can really get into whatever project they have to do.
  But through my door and from our living room I could hear the same tireless rippinng. Rip. 
Rip. Rip. 

 To me he was just doing something for an art project, so I put on my headphones to tune August out.  Under the music I could still hear this
incessant tearing at a steady pace like somebody working an assembly line at a factory.

I walked out into the living room again and August was nearing the end of the book.  Mutilated pages piled around him, mostly to his right where they formed a little carpet on our linoleum,.  I stood in the door jamb watching him for a few minutes until he got to the end of his book.

He yanked out the last page and grasped each cover in his hands and raised them to eye level and pulled them apart, the spine of the book snapping and the threads holding it together snapping apart.  August dropped the covers with no more attention to them than the 400 or so pages scattered on the floor.

I asked,""What was all that about?""

August didn't answer me.  It was like I wasn't even there.  He just put his hands on the couch really awkwardly, just palms down, then his fingers started scratching at the material.  It made this sound that I can only liken to an over-enthusiastic DJ scratching vinyl.  He wasn't just running his hands on the fabric, but really getting into it.

This was really offputting, so I got a little confrontational. ""Dude what the fuck?""

He didn't answer me.  His fingers just scraping away at the couch, which was starting to bare threads a little bit.

""August, what the fuck?""

His hands made claws and grabbed the fabric like he was being electrocuted.  He snatched his head back hard.  Really hard. To the point where it would probably have pulled a muscle or something.
He snatched his headback and bit his lower lip.  He bit his fucking lower lip until it started to bleed.  And he didn't stop until he bit through it.
This all happened in the span of like three seconds, so I wasn't just standing there.

I went into my room and locked them door, which is where I am now.

Nosleep.
What the FUCK?


UPDATE:
Over the past two hours I've experienced the scariest fucking ordeal I've ever had to deal with.  I keep thinking it's over, but it's like a hurricane hitting an eye.
There will be these loud thumps, a scream, then nothing.
Our neighbor I think came by because there was this angry knocking on the front door.  My roommate kept quiet while the guy was at the door, screaming for us to shut up.
There was quiet for about 15 minutes, then August started throwing shit around my apartment.  I'm fairly sure he smashed our TV, and I heard what sounded like dishes being broken on the ground.
He himself has let out almost no noises, except for the occasional moan and that one scream.
Weirdest thing: I heard what I thought was a baby crying.

Right now, it's quiet, but I'm so scared I can't think.
I know it's going to start again.


UPDATE 2:
He's started slamming a door over and over again.  He's pulling it open so it hits the wall and then slamming it shut.
My neighbor's banging at the door again.
I want the night to be over.
I think I might take an ambien.

UPDATE 3:
I'm going to try and update every 15 minutes or less, just to let you know I'm okay.  I've gotten a lot of messages saying you guys are worried about me.
Right now there's no new developments.  August is just slamming the door.
My neighbor has been blaring music really loud, I guess to get back at us. It's just fucking bizarre hearing this really loud angry metal stuff punctuated by SLAM. SLAM. SLAM.

UPDATE 4:I can hear yelling outside of the apartment.  It sounds like a bunch of people.  I think all of my neighbors are pissed off now.  My roommate hasn't lost momentum with the door thing.
At this point, it's just loud and annoying.  I think the worst is over.

UPDATE 5:Sorry for the delay.  My internet had stopped working. I have no idea how.
The door slamming stopped abruptly about twenty minutes ago.  All I can hear right now is a crunching, like somebody eating something loud.

UPDATE 6: I smoked and took some ambien to level myself out.  I'm okay.  Probably won't post a lot more until morning if I fall asleep.  I just want to see what my house looks like. I'm trapped in this goddamn shelter. I don't to make an sound or it will hear and get me.  I took ambien and pot. Not sounding like a smart job.

15,What WAS I doing in my car?,1287356899,"A little background information... I live with my parents and am generally expected to be up pretty late (redditing, gaming, etc)... We live in a one story house and my room is in the front of the house. It has a window to our porch and we have a fairly small yard/driveway.   

So a few nights ago I'm in my room, it's around 11:30 PM, and I'm getting pretty tired. I turn off my computer monitors and lie down. Next thing I know it's just past 9:00 AM and I'm jumping in the shower. I get out and make my way to the kitchen to grab an iced coffee when I turn and see my step-dad on the couch. He's just waking up and when he sees me he asks what the hell I was doing last night. Immediately confused and then a little unsettled when I realize I fell asleep early last night I ask him what he's talking about. He tells me he saw me in my car at what he thinks was around 2:00 AM and at the same time he saw the light on in my room and heard my window open. He goes on to tell me he thought I had a girl over and that I had her leave through the window while I was in my car or something...   

I just stare at him, almost laughing, unable to believe he could be telling the truth. I tell him that I fell asleep early, 12:00 at the latest, and had no one over. Since I've been back from college I haven't even had but one or two friends over and no one else knows where I'm living. He continues to tell me that he was almost positive he saw me (or someone he thought was me he now says) in my car and definitely saw *someone* in my car at the same time a light in my room came on and heard movement at my window.   

Now he's not unreliable, overly imaginative, or anything else that would suggest he wasn't being honest, but I still couldn't believe it. I continued to get dressed and after about an hour went out to check my car (which I always leave unlocked because I cannot unlock the driver-side door from outside of the car). In my car I see the laptop I had left in the backseat, untouched, but I notice nearly all of my change (and I had a lot) gone. My pens in the center console on the floor, various compartments opened or slightly moved. Someone had obviously been rooting around in my car. They had even taken a generous quantity of dimes, nickles, and quarters, but they had left my laptop...   

So now I'm beginning to doubt my step-dad a little less. I walk back inside and tell him what I discovered in my car and then proceed to my room, realizing that he was right about someone in my car and was probably right about someone in my fucking room. My window lacks a screen and therefore I never open it, I rarely even open the curtains as the glare against my PC monitor is awful. When I pull open the curtains to check the lock on my window (which I always have locked for obvious reasons) I see that the window is not locked (though it wouldn't be accurate to say it was unlocked either). The lock was completely gone. I couldn't believe my eyes. None of it made any sense and it still doesn't. Now I'm looking for a replacement lock and I'm making sure to lock my car and room doors...

16,The Holder of the End,1287353175,"In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house in you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself ""The Holder of the End"". Should a look of child-like fear come over the workers face, you will then be taken to a cell in the building. It will be in a deep hidden section of the building. All you will hear is the sound of someone talking to themselves echo the halls. It is in a language that you will not understand, but your very soul will feel unspeakable fear.

Should the talking stop at any time, STOP and QUICKLY say aloud ""I'm just passing through, I wish to talk."" If you still hear silence, flee. Leave, do not stop for anything, do not go home, don't stay at an inn, just keep moving, sleep where your body drops. You will know in the morning if you've escaped succesfully.

If the voice in the hall comes back after you utter those words continue on. Upon reaching the cell all you will see is a windowless room with a person in the corner, speaking an unknown language, and cradling something. The person will only respond to one question. ""What happens when they all come together?""

The person will then stare into your eyes and answer your question in horrifying detail. Many go mad in that very cell, some disappear soon after the meeting, a few end their lives. But most do the worst thing, and look upon the object in the person's hands. You will want to as well. Be warned that if you do, your death will be one of cruelty and unrelenting horror.

Your death will be in that room, by that person's hands.

I woke up in the middle of the night last Monday because I was cold.  I was fumbling around trying to pull my comforter back around myself when I heard sniffing and moving around on my side of the bed.  The sniffing continues up and down my side of the bed, I hear footsteps around the foot of the bed, across the dog bed that is on the floor, and then the sniffing continues along my boyfriend's side of the bed.  I then hear footsteps, like a dog's, back across the floor, out the door, and down the stairs.  All of this took about a minute.  

I didn't think anything of it, as my dog can be a nighttime wanderer.  I rolled over and realized my dog was *on the bed with us*, not moving a hair, head up and eyes wide.

27,The Third Man (anecdote),1287259549,"This is just a little situation I thought up that seemed pretty bone-chilling:

You and a friend are locked in a room with metal walls as part of an experiment. There is a wooden chair in the center of the room. There's nothing to really do but talk to each other. The only odd thing is, there's an electronic display on the wall with the number ""3"" on it.

For a while, the two of you debate what the number means. It's mysterious because you weren't told what the experiment is supposed to really be about. The two of you begin to wonder if the counter is some sort of object of the experiment. So after a while, your friend walks over to the display and finds a solitary switch on the side. He flicks it the other way and some text appears above the number ""3"". It says ""Number of Occupants of Room"".

You and your friend look at each other. For a second you're both freaked out. Then you shrug and just assume it's a glitch because of the chair. You get up and bang on the door to see if one of the experiment overseers will tell you about the counter. No one comes to the door, though. You're left to use your own imaginations.

Suddenly you're both snapped to attention when the chair flies into a wall with a loud crash. You whirl around and look at your friend, who is shaking his head with his eyes widened. The chair lays on the floor in pieces from when it hit the wall. You both look at the counter and the number 3 is still there, unchanged. The chair wasn't making it malfunction. 

You're both suddenly aware that there is a third presence in the room and you're trapped in the room with whoever or whatever it is.

You both remain very quiet, pressed up against the walls of the room. After a few minutes of piercing silence you begin to hear low murmurs. Both you and your friend have your mouths clamped shut and aren't making a sound other than breathing. The low murmuring continues and gets a bit louder as the minutes tick by. Finally you can't take it anymore. You run over to the door and frantically turn the knob and bang on the door, yelling for the experiment overseers to let you out. But no one comes to the door no matter how hard you bang or how loud you scream. Through all your banging, though, you still hear the murmuring... and then a scream. Your friend's scream.

You turn around, your face a white mask of dread, and look at your friend. He's staring at the wall next to you. You look at that wall and see a bloody hand print and a long smear of blood trailing away from it. You and your friend aren't bleeding. 

There is a click and you both look at the monitor. The readout now says there are four people in the room. Whoever or whatever is in there with you has a friend... or an enemy. You both shrink against the walls of the room and listen to the loud murmuring. Footsteps start to accompany the murmurs. Then, out of nowhere, a splatter of blood appears on the far wall. Then another. A loud scream rips through the room and then a pool of blood starts forming in the middle of the floor. You and your friend simply stare at the blood, unable to move and unable to comprehend what's going on.

You look at the counter and it now says ""3"" again. Whoever the fourth person or thing was is now dead and the two of you are alone in the room with the murderous third man.",nosleep,Hllblzr310,/r/nosleep/comments/ds5eg/the_third_man_anecdote/

30,There's something in the woods behind my house.,1287229779,"I live at the end of a dead end street. My house is right at the edge of a fairly dense patch of forest. I have no back yard, just trees. I used to think this was a good thing, as I hate mowing the lawn. Now I'm not so sure.

Just like with any forest there's a variety of animals living in it. Deer, rabbits, skunks, owls, surely many more. Those are just the ones I've seen. Sometimes I'll hear an owl catch a rabbit. The sound of a rabbit screaming while it's being eviscerated is enough to make your blood freeze, but that's not what I'm here to talk about.

My house is on a hill, and behind that hill is another hill. This is important because it means that dead leaves accumulate in the space between hills, and the wind doesn't blow them out. It's not uncommon to hear an animal, a deer or a stray dog or something, crunching through these dead leaves, with the step step, step step gait of a quadruped. Sometimes, though, it's different. Something will be moving back there, with a steadier, bipedal gait. Step, step, step, step. Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.

I'm a hardcore skeptic. I don't believe in ghosts or gods or bigfoots. Naturally, I blamed these human-like sounds on just that, a human. Now it's a little creepy to imagine someone wandering around behind your house in the middle of the night, but it's not too hard to rationalize. Maybe it's a homeless person, with nowhere else to go. Maybe a (very) lost hunter. Maybe it's just someone who likes to walk in the woods at night. These are the things I used to tell myself, to calm myself down. And for a while, it worked.

34,There was something out there...,1287148865,"This happened two days ago.

Its was 11:50 pm, and I drove my girlfriend home after watching a movie. She lives a little bit out of the way- a side road off of a side road, off of a main road...a hidden little gated community in the forest. Normally, there are about a dozen or so deer, plus a few stray cats that wander around looking for a spot to sleep, but that night it was quiet...that eerie uncomfortable quiet when even nature is afraid of making noise. So I'm driving down the road that has maybe two streetlights on something pops up at the edge of my headlights. The first thing I noticed where the eyes; they were reflecting my beams like they were lights themselves- super bright, not the typical deer or cat eyes. This thing was big (orangutan size), and had white fur, but the fur was thin enough to see the pink  skin underneath it. It was crouched down, on two legs, much like humans crouch down, and from it's posture, it looked like it was crouching down eating something.

I slammed on my brakes and reversed to try to get another look at it, but there's no more big animal, only a small white kitten. I tell my girlfriend it was just a bobcat, hoping to calm her (and me too) but I don't believe that.

After making sure she gets in fine, I drive the four miles back to my house. I live in a nice little community, where everything is more or less up-kept, its considered safe, and I've never felt so much as slight hesitation about going outside at night. Its darker than normal though...the street light closest to my house is out, leaving my section of the street unusually dark, and on top of that, I notice my outdoor lights aren't on like they should have been. I turn off the car and hear rustling in the bushes in front of the house across the street. I look into my rear-view mirror and see slight movement of the leaves. I don't think anything of it, and then I hear a whistle. It wasn't a musical whistle, but rather a whistle meant to grab you attention- a short, sharp, whistle. I froze and my eyes snapped to the rear-view mirror; I just sat there unmoving and barely breathing for a good two minutes before I locked my car doors...there was no way I was getting out of the car. For a good eight minutes I sat there, thinking to myself ""WTF was that? This isn't right, somethings out there."" 

A car turns the end of the street, so I decide to use the beams of its headlights to illuminate my path to my front door, hoping that if anything happens to me, at least there will be a witness. So hurriedly, I climb over to the passenger seat, and when the light hits me, I slam open the door and run as fast as I can to my door. As soon as I get inside, I feel a wave of relief, and I can't believe how silly I was acting; I've lived here for eight years after all and never had a problem before.

The neighbor who came home happened to be my friend who lives a few doors down, and the next day in class, he asks me, ""oh hey, what was that thing outside of your car?"" 

Caught off guard, I can only mutter a ""huh?""

37,Difficult to Sleep,1287107933,"Lately at night I've noticed it's a little difficult to get to sleep.  I've developed a small routine for the first time before I go to bed.  Normally a person will wash their face, check for possible blemishes, brush or floss their teeth, etc.  But not my routine.

Every night after keeping myself up well beyond my desired bed time, I get up and check for the outside door to make sure both locks are secured.  Unfortunately for me my roommate has already gone to sleep, so there the common area is devoid of light and no switch to remedy this problem.  As a result, I've used binoculars to check the orientation of the lock handles, but even then I expect to see shadows dance when I remove the lenses.

I've digressed, my apologies.  My routine consists of first closing the main door to my room, then checking the two small closets attached to my room and shutting their doors.  Once that's done, I go to the bathroom, peer around the back of the door and behind the shower curtain, turn off the light and quickly close the door.  Once all four doors are closed, I feel a little at ease and open up the blinds to let in the moonlight before turning off the main lamp.

Once in bed, I lay on my back with head above the covers and let my eyes adjust to the moonlight.  My eyes sometimes play tricks with me, translating simple shadows under the door to dark sinister monsters lurking behind the closed door.  If I leave a door open (which usually happens to be the bathroom door), I think smile.dog is waiting for me.  If I glance over at the ajar door, I can see smile.dog's eyes glowing from the shadows and his pointed teeth glistening in the pale moonlight.  I can feel his horrible visage boring chilled holes deep through my soul.  I try to tell myself that smile.dog does not exist, though unfortunately for me, my imagination wins out over my normal senses.  Like a small kid, I pull the blankets over my head for protection.  If a monster can't see me and if I don't move, then I'm completely safe.  Those are the rules.

This worked just fine and I would stay curled up, albeit overheating, and drift off to sleep.  I'd wake up the next morning feel fine and refreshed, having survived the night and my overactive imagination.  With a small stretch and a jump out of the bed, I'm ready to confront the bright day devoid of any silly childhood monsters.  I check any opened doors and all closed doors, happy again that nothing creepy such as smile.dog is lurking within my residence.

One night after some a large consumption of alcohol, I decided to get some rest.  I let my roommate and our friend who stayed the night over that I, being completely coherent and full of awesome, shall retire for the evening.  I merrily walked into my room, closed all the doors, and promptly snuggled under my bed with my head propped once again above the covers and fell asleep.  I had no worry of silly childhood monsters again, why would I?  Alcohol makes you strong and fit, like a true man!  I was a true man and no longer a boy, monsters should fear me!

I opened my eyes to that feeling.  It's the same feeling that you get when something is wrong and you can't quite put your finger on it.  Somehow during the night, I had managed to put the covers over my head and I was balled up in a fetal position.  I didn't know why I did this but it just felt right, like I had to do it.  I tried not to move as my overactive brain tried to make sense of this strange, ominous feeling.  I began to worry if maybe the alcohol was starting to make me feel sick, and perhaps I should seek the aid of the porcelain goddess.

Do you know that sound of something sinister walking deftly on carpet?  The faint sound that causes your ears to perk up in the night and trigger the adrenaline rush of fear within your brain?  That's the same sound I heard that moment.  I began to sweat and tremble, sitting as motionless as I could as I waited for that next sound.  My anxious nerves did not have to wait long, as I heard it again, and slowly again.

The feeling of something being nearly on top of me was present.  I felt as if I could pull the covers back just ever so slightly, I would see a mass of shadow directly on top of me.  Perhaps a rotting eye of a ghoul or the soulless holes of a banshee hovering above me.  I tried to force myself to sleep, anything to get my mind off of things.  I didn't care if the monster would flay me in my slumber, being dead and asleep is better than being awake and terrified.  I could almost feel the cold presence of this creature, sucking the very life out of the room and soon, me.  The air around me began to feel cold and my sweat felt like ice to my feverish skin.  I wanted to throw the bed covers off of me to cool off but the monster would get me.

The blankets were my only protector between this horrible abomination and defenseless me.  Without my blankets I would not have survived the night, despite waking up in a puddle of sweat and a need to check every room with a flashlight.  I sat on the bed and gave my linens a hug, despite how silly it looked to my wandering roommate.

After a nice relaxing evening out of the apartment, I said good night to my roommate and went back to my room.  I closed off all the doors, turned off the light, and sat on the bed.  Somehow I didn't notice that all of the bedsheets were missing except for my mattress cover.  Somehow I also seemed to miss closing the bathroom door, even though I thought I had just taken care of it.  I couldn't help but look into the shadow of the restroom before I curled up in a fetal position in the corner of the bed, hiding myself under my pillow as best as I could.

38,It's my turn to drive.,1287096748,"A dream.  It's dark outside and I'm driving alone down a long, lightless highway.  The radio is off and all I can hear is the air rushing by as I drive toward some unknown destination.  For awhile, this nearly silent passage is punctuated only by the occasional mile marker.

Suddenly unnerved, I reach down to turn the radio on and, in doing so, notice, out of the corner of my eye, that the passenger side seat is no longer empty.  Someone is sitting there in a posture that suggests they're looking right at me.  I sit up straight in a jolt of panic, trying to decide if I should look over or not.

Finally, I do.  Sitting beside me, staring into my eyes, my doppelganger looks back.  Then, he speaks.

""It's my turn to drive.""

He lunges forward and grasps the wheel and we wrestle for control of the swerving vehicle, a frantic contest of squirming limbs, elbows, and fists.  He *bites* my shoulder and I feel his fingers get under my hands on the wheel.  I scream awake, heart pounding.

42,Something came to me in my sleep...,1287044510,"My mother took her own life 10 years ago. I was 15 at the time and had never experienced anything paranormal before losing her. Basically, a few weeks after her death strange things started to happen. It might just have been my imagination due to the trauma. However, at night time I'd often wake up to the sound of a door slamming. This door was the second door from my bedroom, since I could recognize it from the sound. It happened every few days, and I'd wake up every time. However, after a while I started to feel the presence of something with me in the room upon waking up. To begin with I'd just ignore it and go to sleep again. But one night I heard the door slam harder than usual, and the feeling of being observed again. I turned to face the wall to avoid having to face whatever was in the room, clenching my eyes shut. Then something terrifying happened, I had the sensation of something grabbing my arm and trying to pull me out of my bed. My eyes stayed firmly shut and I resisted as much as I could. Suddenly it stopped and I fell asleep again. It wasn't over... The exact thing happened again a few hours later and the sheer terror of what was happening was almost paralyzing. But then I thought of saying something to make it stop. I nervously but firmly told whatever presence was seeking my attention that it should leave me alone and it was not welcome. I had to repeat myself twice before it stopped. But it apparantly worked. I was left alone. I kept this experience to myself until a few weeks later, when my dad had invited a clairvoyant to our house. My dad, brother and sister had also experienced some weird stuff and were curios to find out what it was. The guy told us that our mother indeed was present, but she was not making any trouble. My dad and sister explained that they had seen her in their sleep, where she'd come up to them and hug them while smiling without saying anything. No, the thing I experienced was something else. The medium told us that the other presence was a former resident of our house. It was a old man who lived there alone. He had apparently become attracted to us due to our openess to the paranormal. We all agreed that the medium should tell him that he should leave unless he would leave us alone. The medium said that the old man agreed to pass on and leave us alone. Afterwards, me brother told me that he had seen a man leaning against a brick wall. He was dressed in a short grey coat, a hat, glasses and had a walking stick. My brother hadn't thought about until afterwards.  A lot of other things were treated during the session, but    that'll have to wait for another post. I know this is a long post. But all the details haven't been included and I'll gladly answer any questions. I've never spoken about this to anyone besides my family. I started to shake a bit when recollecting this experience.

48,I have not moved this fast in a good number of years...,1286922249,"I was last out of the office tonight. It was a little after 6, and it was getting dark. To paint a picture, we occupy about 30% of a large industrial unit. The rest of the unit is unoccupied offices and warehouse space. My office is at the rear of the building and you need to traverse about 100 yards of empty office to get to and from the main exit. 
I was working away on my laptop just finishing off a few bits and pieces. Normally we have a cleaner who comes in after 5pm, however he has been ill for a few days and we don't expect them in this week. 
The building was quite quiet except for the aircon systems that supply our cleanrooms. They start up automatically and occasionally broke the silence as the fans kicked in. 
At some points I could have sworn I heard doors opening and closing, as if the cleaner was in. I wandered through the empty office space go check it out, but the cleaners cupboard was locked. At this point I was getting a bit spooked. The sound of the aircon moaning was not helping and a decided to get away home. 
I headed through the office shutting off lights as I went. Then through the disused offices. Again turning off the lights as I went. At the bottom of the stairs at the side exit I turned off the lighting master switch and turned on the intruder alarm and headed outside. 
I reached into my pocket for my keys. Fuck!!! I had left them on my desk!
Back into the building! I turned off the alarm and headed back upstairs and across the now very dim disused office. I got into my office area and it was near pitch dark as we had closed the blinds due to bright sunshine during the day. I flicked the lightswitch. Nothing! I hadn't turned the master switch back on!
 I had left my monitor on, so fumbled about on my desk and found my keys. 
I don't know what made me look at the door across from my desk (it leads to a fire exit) but I did. The door was slowly swinging open. In the 1 second it took my brain to register this, my body must've thought ""fuck this"" and I hightailed it back towards the exit. And I mean fast. 
I got through the unused space in seconds. As I hit the door to the stairwell I heard a door behind me slam - really slam. I took the stairs in a leap and got back outside. 
How I managed to lock the door with no fumbling or dropped keys I will never know. As I'm standing there I realise I haven't set the alarm! There was no way I was opening the door again, however no alarm, no insurance. At this the security patrol walked round the corner. 
He had found the fire exit at the other end of the building opened and had come into the office to see if anyone was still working. 

Fresh pair of shorts required!

He is the reason you run up the stairs at night, he is the silent watcher that compels you to illuminate as you descend. But some things are better left in the dark.

The electric that threads your spine is not a series of synapses and chemicals, it is the searching touch of his presence. To assume his domain is nothing but the dark is to be gravely mistaken. He finds you when you shiver with excitement at a home run, when serendipity sears moments to your memory, even in the bathroom his touch pervades all.

His touch tells you that this too shall pass.

Tonight, I'd tossed and turned most of the night unable to properly sleep for some reason, then about 7am as I was lying there trying to sleep, I hear what sounds like a whisper saying my name (craig) over and over again.  The whisper was like someone was trying to see if I was awake, like some people do when they stay over and don't want to wake you with a start.  As I hear my ""name"" repeated over and over again, I start to listen for movement to see whether my flatmate is awake and its just him trying to tell me something, but I can hear him snoring away in the next room (he's pretty loud).  I was started to get a little scared so I turned around in my bed towards the source of the noise and there was nothing there.  The skeptic in me says its just a coincidence and it was just a noise that happened to sound like my name to my mind, however a part of me feels like someone/something had a message and wanted me awake.

54,Scratching Noises,1286863362,"One Friday evening I'm in my bathroom getting ready while my boyfriend is on the couch watching television. Our house only has one bathroom and it has a door to both the hallway and master bedroom. His mother had passed away a few months prior and the house was left to us in her will. After everything was taken care of we closed up the master bedroom since neither of us felt comfortable going in there. As I'm doing my make up, I begin to hear a scratching sound coming from behind me. I turn around and realize that it is coming from underneath the door to the master bedroom. ""Hey babe did you lock the cat in your mom's old room on accident?"" I thought nothing of the noise since it was a pretty common thing for him to do. ""No, why?"" It was also common of my boyfriend to deny any blame placed on him and as the scratching became more fervent my faith in his answer dwindled. ""Are you sure? Because he is definitely trying to get out of the master bedroom."" I waited for a response and it finally came with hesitance, ""That would be a little bit difficult since he is laying at my feet."" All of a sudden the scratching stopped.

My boyfriend and I looked everywhere for some sort of answer. The entrance to the attic is in our bedroom so there's no way to get in or out of the master bedroom besides the doors and the windows. Both windows in the room were shut. We checked under everything, in the closet, behind the dresser. We eventually gave up.

58,I wouldn't believe this myself if it didn't happen to me directly.,1286585555,"I like to consider myself a pretty rational person. I don't really believe in the supernatural or anything. I usually try to find a scientific answer for everything.

But the other day, I was sitting here at my computer, leaning back, watching a video on YouTube. On my desk, behind my keyboard, was my phone, and to the left of the keyboard, an empty lemonade can. If I press any button on my phone, the screen lights up and tells me to press the sequence of buttons needed to unlock it.

Well, since I was just sitting there, the screen was obviously dark, and I wasn't touching anything. Suddenly, it lit up, and as I was turning my head down to look at it, confused, I saw the lemonade can move away from me about an inch, in a quick, jerky motion. Fan was off, there wasn't any wind or anything. Completely level surface. It just moved.

That night, in bed, I thought about it again. After a few minutes, suddenly my pillow shifted. Not like it had to settle or that I had moved my head or anything, but it felt like someone grabbed the end and lightly, but quickly, shook it back and forth. Just for a split second. Freaked me out, so I turned over and saw nothing. Room's completely normal.

Yesterday, I was sitting at my computer again. Don't remember what I was doing, probably talking to a friend on AIM or something. For some reason, I turned around and looked at my bed. In that instant, I saw lightning above my bed. Fucking *lightning*. It wasn't just a flash, either. I saw the broken line shape quickly dart down, maybe about two feet, I think, and disappear. I also heard a soft but sharp ""pop"" sound.

Of all that, the lightning is really the only thing I can rationalize. Maybe a hallucination or something. But still, what the hell?

60,"Dream, Prank, or Demon?",1286576563,"This is just one of the scarier experiences I had; still not sure about this one, but it is weird on so many levels. It has cost me many a night’s sleep thinking about it, and now I hope it will do the same for you.

I was around 12 years old. I grew up in an old house, at least 200 years old, and this place was full of mind shattering experiences; this is just the first that springs to mind. My family and I came to believe that there were a minimum of two spirits in this home, one bright, shining, and peaceful, and the other as dark and malevolent as one can imagine. To my brother and me one acted as a protector, the other a tormentor. 

One night I was getting ready for bed, and my mother came in to say goodnight. Well, at the time I thought it was my mother, but looking back I have my doubts. The exchange we had was absolutely nothing like any conversation we had before. My mother always turns away from the supernatural, she’s a good “Church of Christ Christian,” and she doesn’t like to discuss “strange” things at all. 

Instead of saying goodnight, she proceeds to tell me how a demon once came to a 12 year old girl. I’m sitting there looking at her, thinking this is way out of character for Mom. She tells me it came at night crawled up next to the girl, and began growling in her left ear. She told me the girl said the Lord’s Prayer over and over and it eventually went away. 

I remember looking at her, trying to ascertain why she was telling me this story. I was quite stunned by her telling me anything supernatural in nature, and I really could not figure out why she was telling me this right before I went to bed. 

Lights out and I am lying there really trying to make sense of why Mom would say those things. I try to blow it off, and I am getting comfortable snuggling into the covers and turn on my right side. 

Suddenly, with no warning, the most awful, fearsome noise I have ever heard in my life, before or since, starts up in my left ear. It wasn’t human or animal. The sound was so close; the grating, growling, scratching, moaning sound that was pouring in my *left* ear had me paralyzed. I was terrified, stunned; I couldn’t move. I was afraid to breathe. I wanted to scream, but I was afraid of the consequences from the growling thing at my left ear. 

I am not now, nor was I then a Christian, but at that moment I thought saying the Lord’s Prayer might be a good idea. It didn’t have any effect, but I was only reciting it in my head. I was too terrified to say anything aloud. The growling continued for what felt like an eternity, but it was probably more like ten minutes of mind-wrenching, logic-blasting horror. It suddenly stopped, I lay there listening for the foot (or hoof) falls of something leaving, but there were no other sounds. I lay there until the sun rose, trying to make sense of this experience. 

As of yet, I cannot come up with an explanation. I have heard dogs growl, mountain lions scream, and bears roar, but I have never heard a sound like that one. No horror movie special effects can recreate that layered, ethereal, hair-raising sound. 

Even at the age of 12, I was a skeptic. I lay there trying to find an earthly source for this (without opening my eyes!) I knew no one would fit under the bed, no one (visible) had crawled beside the bed as I turned the lamp off after “Mom” had left the room. To this day, I still have doubts as to whether this was really my mother or not; I can stress to you enough how out of character this conversation was for her. I sometimes wonder if it was really the protective spirit trying to warn me of what was to come.

I still cannot figure out how someone could have gotten into the room unnoticed, much less how they could have produced that sound just centimeters from my left ear. 

P.S. As I was proof-reading this, the phone rang. It was my mother. I just had to ask her. I could not hold back. I asked her about the incident. What she said scared me *maybe* even more than the growling itself all those years ago. She adamantly said there was no way that was her. She said, “You know I don’t tell tall-tales. And why would I scare you like that before bed?”

65,Starting up again,1286487312,"Let me preface by saying that unusual occurrences have been part of my life since I was three. As a result, I have learned to ignore a great many things, and things that would freak most people smooth out do not phase me. More than one incident has sent my friends packing while I sat and laughed. However, at this stage in my life paranormal occurrences have dropped down to a dull roar. That is until recently, there has been a marked increase in the unexplainable. The increase started subtly. This is how it began: 

A few weeks ago, I came home from errands, and my daughter said the external hard drive was doing tricks. She is 15, and not prone to making up stories. We had the hard drive hooked up to the TV in the living room. She told me how she was watching the Twilight Zone (that’s my girl!) and the cord connecting the drive to the TV lifted in the air, stayed there for several seconds, and then dropped down. She described saying it was just like someone picked it up between their fingers, held it there, and then let it go.

Well, honestly, despite my experiences I am a skeptic. I always look to logic first for an explanation. I went and looked at the cord, and there was nothing out of the ordinary. I kind of blew it off, maybe she was asleep, it could have been a trick of the light, or well, the cord lifted in the air, and then dropped. Since there hadn’t been much going on weird-wise at the time, I didn’t really give it much thought. 

We watched a couple of shows from the hard dive, our own personal sci-fi channel, and talked for a while. She was getting ready for bed. I was tired too, and I moved toward the TV stand to cut of the hard drive via its external switch. As my hand reached toward it, I was not touching it in any way, and this huge, heavy 1TB drive quickly slid away from my hand like it was a magnet pushing away an from opposing charge. I had to jump fast to catch it before it dove off the stand. 

I really couldn’t have been more surprised. I grabbed the drive, and set it on the floor to make it harder for it anything to knock my expensive toy to the floor. I went to bed, telling the *air* not to mess up my electronics.

83,The Sidewalk (local urban Legend),1286075294,"The story goes some time in the last 50 years a retaining wall was needed to prevent avalanches and to provide back-access to a hospital that had been built in the area. The building of the wall was plagued with strange accidents; sections that had been recently finished were found demolished, trucks were sabotaged, and the area dug out for the construction were mysteriously filled back in and made to look as if they'd never been dug. Despite these hindrances, the retaining wall, nicknamed ""the Sidewalk"", was completed. 

Soon after, hospital staff routinely used the Sidewalk to take nature walks. The walkway went on for miles, weaving through the beautiful hills and even over a large crevasse. Things went smoothly at first, but reports started coming in of animal remains being left on the Sidewalk. The remains weren't just normal dead animals, but a combination of animal entrails and bones organized into patterns. Soon after a nurse fell off the wall into the crevasse. when the authorities found her body, it had a similar display of animal entrails on it. After several more accidents, the Sidewalk was deemed too dangerous and was off limits to hospital personnel. 

Unfortunately, the accidents didn't end. A janitor disappeared while on duty, never found again. When a doctor went missing from inside the hospital, a manhunt was organized and hundreds of people poured into the hills. The search party found old huts and evidence of many years of bonfires. They never found any tracks near these areas, though, which they assumed meant they were abandoned so long ago the weather had simply removed the evidence. The doctor was eventually found, what was left of him, at the bottom of the crevasse where the first victim was found. His body had been meticulously taken apart and rearranged into the same pattern as the earlier animal remains. There was no evidence that he'd been put there, though, as the ground was undisturbed. 

After the incident was published in the paper, an anthropologist contacted the police to inspect images of the body. After carefully reviewing the evidence, he cited stories from over 150 years ago of gold prospectors disappearing. He found an old newspaper image of a man's body that had been dismembered and laid out in a specifically organized configuration. He noted that the configuration was an ancient Native American symbol which indicated a supernatural warning. 

The hospital was shut down and abandoned soon after, and records of the Sidewalk were destroyed. Any roads leading to the Sidewalk or the hospital were blocked off and over time deteriorated and became overgrown, basically disappearing.

84,One Friday..,1285970911,"Well I should give you some background information. It was 2004 my friends and I are in 11th grade and to say the least.. we were complete dumb asses, theres 4 of us A,D,M and me. One day at lunch we are talking about random stupid scary shit / scary stories. So i tell the story of how my mom and her friend used a Ouija-board and how she can't talk about her experience because of how crazy it was. All she ever told me was to 1. Don't ever fucking touch one. 2. If you are retarded and don't listen to me don't ever bring one into this house or you'll open a portal to the dead or the underworld or whatever she said I forget the exact words. Well of course we all call bullshit and go buy one. We waited about 2 weeks to mess with it because A's parents were leaving for the weekend. It was probably around 9 maybe 9:30 p.m on Friday we lock the doors and turn off all the lights and go upstairs to A's room. We lite 4 candles and open that bitch up and start messing around. Since it is A's house we let him do the controlling; however, we all come up with questions to ask. First A asked ""is anyone or anything here"" it spells out ""yes"". I thought it was A was fucking around but fuck it I'll go along and ask a question, I asked ""how old are you?"" it responds with ""16 17 17 17"" our ages. A goes again and asked ""are you a guy or a girl"" no response he then asked ""what's your name"" no response. D asked ""are you still here?"" it responds and says ""yes"". That's when I heard the first noise, it sounded like a door opened and closed but it wasn't loud at all. No one said anything so I figured I was paranoid and D asked another question  ""are you female or male"" it replied with ""neither"". Well that was trippy and A is a douche so still figure he's messing around. I ask ""evil or peaceful"" it spells out ""demonic"" now we are scared well everyone but M he's been pretty calm this whole time. M asked ""prove it"" one candle is blown out. I'm pretty fucking over it and scared shitless everyone is saying ""wtf, o shit"" ""lets get the fuck out of here"". M goes on a rampage and starts saying ""pussie, real demonic you pussie"" now we all heard noises from the hall just loud bangs like someone was stomping on the floor and hitting the walls. This can't be real but how are we all hearing the same shit?? A goes for the light it doesn't come on.. This whole time M is still talking shit ""I knew you it was you A you and that demon are both pussies"" etc. D stands up and in the most evil demonic voice nothing like I have ever heard and says ""you want demonic?"" ""I'll show you demonic"" but he doesn't do shit he is just standing there in a trance or something. We all kind of spread of out and form a triangle around him. I'd say a minute maybe a little less he turns and stares at M for probably 15seconds starts screaming, (but it wasn't a scream I really can't describe it) and begins attacking M with his nails and starts biting him around his chest and neck. I try to move and help him but I'm honestly frozen. A is freaking the fuckout and kicks D in the face and continues to kick him now D attacks A. I'm moving now I'm flicking the light over and over it won't turn on the door won't open. I saw a lamp on A's desk turned it on to find a weapon. D stops instantly walks out and goes somewhere, I'm not sure where. I go to do M he's pretty fucked up a chunk of his cheek was gone and was bleeding a lot from his neck. A isn't that bad he fought him off well he had a lot of scratches but not many bite marks. We call 911 didn't explain the situation just told them to hurry the fuck up. At this point we are locked in the bathroom waiting for police. We hear footsteps all over the house along with some growling noises, I couldn't tell if I was A's dog or D looking for us. The police show up and enter through the locked front door - I guess D left through that door. They search the house top to bottom D isn't anywhere. M goes to the hospital A comes to my house to sleepover until his parents return. So M's parents go to the hospital and stay over night with him. He's allowed to go home the next day. M returns home and finds D dead in his  bathroom  in the tub, he set him self on fire believe it or not. There was no suicide note. I'm not sure if it D was depressed/psycho scarring us for life and offing himself(He was never showed any signs..but some don't) or if D was truely possessed. A moved 2-3 months later because of steps/loudnoises/growing and other unexplainable shit, he moved about an hour away. M hasn't and will never be the same. He is a heavy drinker and pill popper. This all happened within 15 minutes we were all 100% sober. I'm not in contact with either M or A. My advice to you - don't fuck with these things. I'll never forget that Friday night and the call I got from M the next morning.",nosleep,throwaway3000z,/r/nosleep/comments/dloxc/one_friday/

92,Dance Majors,1285816584,"This is a story of an event that happened at my university (Top 100 in U.S News). 
As far as 4-year universities go, I would imagine most of them have dormitories to house the transfer students and incoming freshmen. My university was no different. First day/week we all experienced the euphoric 'getting to know each other' phase, where we introduce ourselves, our major, our backgrounds, our hobbies, etc. I remember there was this pretty cute girl, let's call her Cindy and she was a dance major. She was pretty into it too, striving the extra mile and always constantly practicing after class, evenings, in her dorm, etc. As the months progressed, curriculum obviously gets harder and a small % of the people get ""weeded"" out, persay, out of the university because they're unable to keep up with their grades. Between taking her GE's and practicing for an upcoming exhibition, it was obvious that Cindy was pretty stressed. I think dancing gave her an outlet though, or an 'escape' as you will. 

One day after dinner at the commons, a couple people decided to head back to their dorms and study. Her dorm window faces the basketball courts, which are near the dining commons, so it's a pretty sweet spot in terms of convenience and view (if you go to this university, you'll know. You can see people playing basketball as you eat here, with a good view of the dorms [one of them being Cindy's]). Her curtains were closed, but she was obviously practicing dance as the group noticed her silhouette spinning and piourreting(sp?) inside her room. They didn't think much about it and went to the study lounge.

Next day her friends didn't hear from Cindy and her roommate had a BF on campus so she was never home. People just thought she really needed to buckle down and study and didn't think much about it... plus people had seen her dancing in her room the night before. However, this night her roomie decides to go back to her dorm to get new clothes. What she saw freaked her out and people reported hearing 'a bloodcurdling scream'. Cindy had been dead for a day and a half, a rope connecting her neck to the rotating ceiling fan. ",nosleep,SmegmaCracker,/r/nosleep/comments/dktn9/dance_majors/

4,Small step stool moving around my kitchen,1285647727,"I have a story about something I experienced earlier today.  

At about 8 in the morning, maybe closer to 9, I step out of the shower and head downstairs to my kitchen to make some coffee and grab a bit of yogurt before I head into work.  My wife had already left for work so it was just myself, my little dog, and my cat.  I step into the kitchen and...everything is normal, nothing strange.  After I get my coffee and yogurt, I head upstairs and consume them while reading Reddit, most likely.  After a half hour or so, I head downstairs and I notice that the step stool is sitting in the very middle of the kitchen floor.  I think to myself that this it is odd, but really don't think much of it other than how I could have failed to notice it before and how I did not trip over it.  Usually, the stool is out of the way as it is only occasionally used by my wife when she needs to reach stuff at the top of the cabinets.  I slide the stool with my foot back to its normal location and go about my day.  

About two hours ago, after we have both returned home from work and have eaten, my wife and I are sitting in the living room talking and listening to her iPod when there is a knock from upstairs.  We occasionally hear these things but we always attribute them to either the house settling or possibly a slight shake caused by the train that runs maybe a quarter mile away.  This reminds me of the stool incident from this morning so I bring it up and ask her if she left the stool in the middle of the kitchen.  She says no and that she hasn't used it recently.  Then we start talking about something else when we both hear something move ever so slightly on the floor, just a small ""sshhhhkkkk"", like plastic moving across a tile.  Coincidentally, we look over and there is the stool, sitting at an angle away from the wall and not how I left it before.  Of course, we both looked at each other wide eyed and I pulled up the laptop and googled ""poltergeist"". Probably not the best way to deal with this.

So, what are some good ways to deal with a possible foundation issue in case all the recent rains have caused my house to not be perfectly level?",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/djtr3/small_step_stool_moving_around_my_kitchen/

8,haunted couch?  (True story),1285574135,"So I'm a first time poster in this section.  This is a throwaway account, because I don't want to ruin my account if this post is trolled and I'm humiliated :-D  I wouldn't blame any of you, it's not a believable story.

Standard preamble: This is a true story.  I don't expect you to believe, but it is absolutely true.  I'm a hard atheist, and I don't believe in anything supernatural.  But I still don't know how to explain these events.  Another thing to note is that I didn't suspect anything supernatural at the time, it was only about a year later that I was able to make the connections.  The story ties together in a very sort of subtle way, but I think it'll be fairly obvious in my retelling of the events.  It wasn't obvious at the time though.

This took place two years ago.  I had started my third year of college in Manhattan.  My roommate and I just rented a nice little apartment in East Village, and it was a great find; spacious living room, bathroom, and two bedrooms — ideal for two college students.  (For those of you who know the area, I was around 12th and Avenue A)

To give a quick layout of the place, there are four rooms.  The living room (which also had a kitchen sink, fridge, stovetop, and microwave) was connected to the front door.  This room was also connected to the three other rooms: my bedroom, Vince's bedroom, and a bathroom.  The living room is where all the spookiness happened.

In the hectic two weeks in which my roommate and I were furnishing / cleaning up the apartment, we purchased a couch off of Craigslist for the low price of 35 dollars! (under the condition that we pick it up and transport it ourselves).  It was a nice two person couch, maybe a little shabby looking but VERY comfortable.  Everyone gasps in surprise the way you just SINK into it.  The young woman said that her mother had given it to her, but she was upgrading to a bigger couch and had no room for it.  We threw it in our living room, behind a small coffee table.

Minor arguments started occuring about two weeks into the school year.  And it primarily concerned one thing.  We would sometimes wake up and the living room light would be switched on.

My roommate is a hardcore advocate of conserving electricity, and the first few times he chided me gently; he told me that I must have ""gotten up in the night, and forgotten to turn them off"".  I thought it was probably him who did it, but I let it pass.

This phenomenon would continue to happen.  Sometimes twice a week we would wake up in the morning and find the living room light on.  My roommate was infuriated when I suggested that perhaps HE left the light on.  I then suggested that maybe there was something funky going on in the wiring, but the building's super (who is also an electrician) took a look and said everything seemed fine.  I then grew worried.  I had never lived with Vince before.  I was certain that he must have some sort of sleeping disorder that either caused him to sleepwalk, or to get up in the middle of the night and forget about it the next morning.  My suspicions were vindicated one night when I could HEAR footsteps outside my door: they walked across the living room to the front door.  I could hear the front door open, and then close.

I was having strange dreams.  I have to pause here to explain that I've always — my whole life — had strange, recurring, and sometimes obviously symbolic dreams.  For just one example, when my life is getting a little hectic, I dream that I'm driving a car but losing control and crashing into things.  Very cliché.

Anyways, I started having the following dream a few times a week.  I'd be in a long hallway, and it's very dark, covered in shadows (although I don't notice this DURING the dream, I only realized it after).  There are mock paintings on the wall, but I can never really remember what they are, I think they were something scenic.

The main characteristic of the dream is a strange feeling I have: I want to sit down.  My legs and feet are overwhelmingly exhausted, and I just HAVE to sit down.  It almost feels like a force of gravity is pulling me.  I look at the ground and prepare to sit down, but I then notice that the ground is wet, covered in a thin layer of murky water.  And that's the dream.  I must be working too hard in school or something.

The following month, three things happened that started to mystify me.  I'm a skeptic, but I love a good spook, and I used to joke about these three things with my friends (I wove the mysterious living room light into the tale as well.  By this time, Vince and I had accepted it to be an electricity malfunction).

Here are the three things:

#1) I was using the toilet one day, when I heard my roommate call out: ""Where are you?""  It sounded distant, in retrospect I'm not even sure if it sounded like him.  But at the time my mind instantly registered it to be my roommate, and I called back ""Hold on, I'm taking a shit"".  When I left the bathroom, nobody was in the apartment.  I called Vince; he told me he had been playing tennis uptown for the past few hours.  Hm.

#2) One day I came home from school, and the living room sink was turned on.  The water was overflowing onto the floor, and my M-Audio speakers were fucking ruined.  Annoying.

#3) This one isn't a single event, but a recurring one.  Remember the sound of the footsteps in the living room I mentioned?  It ended with the front door opening and closing?  Well, I started hearing these sounds on a weekly basis.  The footsteps never sounded quite the same.  Sometimes they moved sort of questioningly, sometimes confidently.  Sometimes they sort of circled around a few times.  Sometimes there even seemed to be two people.  Once I think the footsteps even ran.  But it always ended with the front door opening and closing.  Like I said, I had just assumed that my roommate was walking in his sleep, when something suddenly struck me.  The door that opened and closed sounded NOTHING like our front door.  It was completely different.  The door I heard at night sounded large, heavy, and kind of old, absolutely nothing like our door.

Okay, so this must have all been a little confusing, so let me lay out all the evidence.

Three recurring things:
#1) I have the hallway dream.
#2) I hear footsteps and the door at night.
#3) The living room light is turned on in the morning.

Two isolated incidents:
#1) The tap was left on.
#2) I heard someone calling to me when I was on the toilet.

Then something else happened.

It was finals week.  My roommate had already left for home (winter break), and I was living in the apartment by myself for a few days.  I had just gotten back from a Recording Technology exam, and I crashed onto the living room couch.  It was about 11am, and I hadn't slept a wink the night before, as I was studying.  I instantly fell into a deep sleep, and throughout the entire following dream I had a strange (almost pleasant) floating sensation.

I was in the hallway again.  The paintings were on the walls, and the ground might have been wet, but I didn't notice it this time.  This is because I didn't feel any urge to sit down this time.

Everything was dark.  Yes, I could actually note that everything was dark DURING the dream this time.  In fact, this time it actually felt like I was in control of my actions.  In the other dreams everything seemed premeditated and predictable; like I was just a puppet being guided by strings.  This time I was very much there, and very much lucid.

I turned around, but there was a dead end behind me.  Just an empty wall.  The only way to move was forward, down this narrow hall.  I didn't really want to move down this hall, but I felt like I had no choice.  I sort of stood there contemplating.

In the distance, I saw a figure moving forward ahead of me.  I could hear footsteps as well.  I felt sort of relieved: ""Good, someone else is here, and this person is moving down the hallway first.  I guess I'm supposed to follow suit"".  I moved forward, into the darkness.  I heard the person ahead of me open and close a door, and eventually I reached this door myself.

It was a very old fashioned door, with a wooden knob.  With some difficulty I turned the knob — it was a little bit stiff — and looked into the room ahead.

This room was PITCH BLACK.  I mean, the last room was only dark and shadowed.  In here, I couldn't see two goddamned feet ahead of me.  The air was a little cold and damp.  I had the feeling that it was a VERY big room, but of course I had no way of knowing.  It felt like there was something very large in there, but once again, there was no way of knowing.

Where was the person I followed in?  I called out: ""Where are you"".  The only response is a slight echo.  It was a big room.

I was suddenly gripped by fear.  I didn't want to move in, but I didn't have a choice, did I?  I decided that there was no way in hell I was moving forward.  So I gripped the wall to the right of me, and I inched to my right, guiding myself along the wall.

I was surprised that the wall felt like any ordinary, indoor wall.  I expected it to be stone or industrial, given the cold damp air in the room.  I inched further and further into the room, and eventually I came up to a light switch.  Goody!  My finger was half an inch from the switch when suddenly, an elderly hand shot out from the darkness and snatched my wrist.

I screamed and awoke with a start.  I was sitting on my living room couch, and the microwave clock read 4:00 am.  I panted for air.  I could still physically feel where the cold hand had clamped my wrist.  It felt so real.  But dreams are dreams, and I had returned to reality.  I sighed.  I was back in familiar territory.  Everything seemed normal.

In fact, I guess the only thing that wasn't normal is that the living room light was switched on.",nosleep,funkychow,/r/nosleep/comments/djdwq/haunted_couch_true_story/
9,The Entity,1285567431,"His mother, restless and frustrated, walked into his bedroom and flipped on the lights. It was the third time Marcus had yelled for her that night, and all three times she had assured him that the darkness has nothing to hide. Still, Marcus had his doubts. It may be true that he neither saw, nor heard anything out of the ordinary, but he could not shake the feeling that the darkness harbored an unwelcome entity. After making it apparent to Marcus that she would ignore his calls henceforth, his mother shut off the lights and returned to her bedroom across the hall.

An unimaginable fear gripped Marcus instantaneously. He clenched his fists tightly under his sheets as he scanned his bedroom in panic. His chest pulsated with the ferocious beating of his heart. Inexplicable noises began to fill his ears. Indistinguishable whispering. Loud creaking. Thumping. Thumping. And then--he saw it. A human-like figure standing at the foot of his bed. A grin on its face. A yellow glow in its eyes. Marcus' entire body stiffened. He yelled for his mother. Surely she would come. The figure approached. He yelled again. Again. Aga...

10,My First Apartment (true story),1285556175,"Hey No Sleep!

So this story is about my first ever apartment. After graduating from undergraduate, I moved back home to attend graduate school. I was very excited to have my own space that I paid for. My boyfriend also moved in with me, and it was the first time we lived together, after three years of a long distance relationship. To say I was happy about this arrangement was an understatement. 

It began small. Our moods darkened, I fell into a depression. The apartment seemed dark and shady, no matter the time of day. At night, I would hear whispers. The voices would be indiscriminate, and I couldn't distinguish definite words from any of the noise. I would sit up in bed and open my eyes, expecting the voices to stop. They didn't. Only after my boyfriend was awake and asking me if I was OK, would they quiet down. This happened three-four times in the span of six months. The last time it occured, I clearly heard the voices call me by name. The next day, I came home from work and my boyfriend said that while he was home alone, he heard someone say hello to him very loudly and clearly. 

A month later, nothing further had happened. We had assumed everything had been in our heads, and nothing was going on. A case of mass hysteria between two people, as it were. Until one night, when we were getting ready for bed, it came back. I was in the bathroom and he in the bedroom down the hall. I was watching the patch of light underneath the door where the hall light shown in ( the light in the bathroom was off.) As I watched, a shadow walked across the doorway, and stood in front of it, blocking the light. I opened the door quickly after gathering my courage, and nothing was there. No light obstruction, and nothing that could have obstructed it. After I closed the door, I looked down again to see the shadow once again in front of the door. I never told my boyfriend what I saw, afraid he would think me crazy. Two weeks later, he reported to his mother that this very same night, he swore he saw something walk in front of the bedroom door, obstructing the light, and move down the hallway towards the bathroom. He didn't tell me, either.

Needless to say, we were spooked. We looked up and performed a smudging ritual on ourselves and our apartment. All strange occurences stopped. We moved out as soon as our lease was up (because of this and other reasons.) We moved on a Sunday, and I received a call from the apartment complex Monday. Maintenance had visited our apartment to fix a broken interior door we had reported before we moved, and we still had the keys because the lease wasn't up for three more days. They asked me why I wasn't answering them, and why I wasn't letting them in. I told them that I had moved out yesterday, and to go ahead and go in, nothing was in there. The maintenance man stopped, and said slowly,

""But if you're not there, why do I see a shadow walking across your living room and standing in front of your balcony?"" 

After opening the unit, every window and door was found to be secured from the inside. The unit had been vacant for years before we moved in, and they had trouble keeping it occupied. I wonder why....

""In rural Wisconsin, there is an old abandoned park. Built in the 1920s, it served as the town’s gathering place for everyone.

That is, until a newly developed Train and Tunnel for Tots™ ride was installed in 1932. It was an innocent looking childish train, with one main (mechanized) head car, with three small trolleys pulled behind it. It went around some loops before going into a small tunnel.

But this is where the story gets weird. There were numerous cases of child deaths that year, all of them happening after the child rode on that train system. Some kids went missing in that short tunnel (about ten feet), and others went comatose after leaving. One, upon exiting, was found to be dead. Her dress was covered in what looked like small bloody handprints. Some killed themselves by scratching at their throats until they bled out, and one of them even killed another child before hanging herself with razor wire at the family’s farm.

The park was closed, and the town’s popularity as a tourist town plummeted.

Recently, a team of scientists were sent out to the park. They taped a video camera to the train, and put a new intern in with it, before sending it on its way onto the tracks.

When the train left the tunnel, it was empty, except for the camera.

The last ten seconds were nothing but static, save for the sound of children laughing.

So, the other night I am rather restless because it starts out with a nightmare where I murder someone with a rock in the woods, but thats beside the point. I ""wake up"" with fright from the sick nature of the nightmare, but I look down at my waist as I feel this silky, furry arm slip around me while Im laying in bed. At this point I am probably in the astral plane, but I am not always aware of it when I am.
Then, I glance to my left and there is this skinny, brown creature looking into my face with this ghastly grin, with many many long fangs and shadowy eyes with a slight glint. It murmurs a sort of greeting in my ear, but it is very malicious. 
Next, I cant see the creature but I cannot move, I feel like it has wrapped itself around me. In alarm, I start yelling at it to get off of me. I feel like I cant even vocalize because I only hear the yelling in my head. I keep yelling at it to get off me, my yelling becoming screaming, because it is becoming hard to breathe. I am opening and shutting my eyes while i struggle, and at one point i see the shadowy sillohuette of the fangs in front of my face, as if my head is already being swallowed by the creature. It felt like I was about to be possessed and I was NOT going to let that happen.

It finally occurred to me that if I am in the astral, then I need to find my way back to the physical by anchoring myself to it. I reach and grab an object in my room nearby and it all stops, and I am awake for real. 

Paralysis is very common while in the astral plane, and personally it manifests in so many different ways.

26,A gift from my dad...,1285213444,"Hey NoSleep! 
 
 
This is so exciting, I've been lurking here for months and I enjoy all the scary stories, the unsettling photos and videos - all of it -  I've even commented a few times. Simply wonderful. 
  
  
  
I am posting today, because my dad just gave me this... [statue](http://imgur.com/k9GaOl&amp;V8hEt&amp;BgPWx)... (There are three pictures in that little album).
  
  
  
Creepy right?
  
  
So my dad was stationed on Guam during the Vietnam War in the late 60s or early 70s. Shortly before he was stationed there, he was in California on Leave and he met my mom. Forgive any incongruities; I never really paid attention to the military lingo, so bear with me. When my dad went back to Guam, he either brought my mom with him, or scheduled a time for her to come and live with him, claiming they were engaged (I guess that was the only way to bring someone to a base? I have no idea; he did stress the fact that he had to say they were engaged, after you know... three dates... all in the same week.) 
  
  
  
So my dad's job was working on the planes in the hangars, because he wanted to serve, but he had ulcers and I guess that basically bars you from... serving in the field? He was in the Navy so, serving in the sea? The Water? The Big Blue? Whatever the term is, he couldn't do it. 
  
  
One day after work, near the end of their time on Guam, my dad had gone to this village and found this woodworker who had all these Native Inspired Statues. My dad really liked the one pictured in the link above, because he knew me mom was into shit that scares most people. He picks it up at a steal (Or stole it, I don't quite remember which) and brings it home. 
  
  
  
My mother was not amused. She hated it, hated him for bringing it into their little bungalow on the base and wanted it anywhere else (preferably in the fire) than in the house. My dad decides he's going to take a stand and keep it... as an ashtray. Turns out the wood is highly inflammable and when he left his cigarette on it for about ten seconds the base starts to smolder and releases this nasty noxious cloud of smoke. My dad, being a Montana boy, born and raised, pees on it. Because you know, he had drunk a lot of beers, his bladder was full and it seemed like a good idea at the time. 
  
  
  
Well, during the night a huge storm starts up. Monsoon level. Not sure if it was one or not, but Guam is basically puckering up it's collective sphincter at the ferocity of it. Lasts for a few days and my mom is sweating bullets that their departure will be postponed. She's a wreck. She knew he kept the statue; his hiding place for it was next to the front door facing in, like it was waiting for someone to leave the door open long enough. My dad, always the prankster.
  
  
  
She wants to leave Guam, leave him. He's a jerk and Guam has bugs as big as a banana.  My dad, being a prankster, but also suave in his younger years, decides if she is still mad, he'll propose to her. Win her over. Turns out she's still mad, but when he proposes I guess he said the right words, dressed just so, sexed her up just right. Whatever. She says yes and so he gets up, in the middle of the night, in the middle of a shit-storm outside and they go find the base Chaplain. 
  
  
  
  
They get married that night, with a five-foot-nothing barrel of a French man as my dad's Best Man, a delightful contrast to my mom's Maid of Honor; whom was a 6'7"" Polish Transvestite. They got married by candle light (because the power had already been out for two days). Very romantic... in a David Lynch sort of way.
  
  
Shortly after, the storm breaks and my parents leave a few days after.
~~~~~~
  
  
So when my parents got back to the mainland, they settled in Oxnard, California. Cheap apartment; shady part of town. My mom, being a bit of an Ingenue doesn't understand how a car could go into a garage one color - and come out a different color with a different license plate. My dad informs her it's a chop-shop and *""You.Didn't.See.Anything.""*  My mom freaks out and spends a lot of her time heading out of town with one of her friends. They go and explore ghost towns, investigate supposedly haunted places; honestly if she was in a horror movie, she'd have been killed 45 times. Blonde. Perky. Giggly. Captain of the Cheerleaders in high-school. 
  
  
  
But life isn't a horror movie. At least not one with a clear baddie. She investigates these areas and writes in journals and she and her friend have a great time. However, every time without fail, the statue (which my dad had given the name 'Koschitzky""... thereby foiling my mother and her crusade to 'burn it on accident in a fire out in the desert away from anyone she may care about'... because my dad had named it. Once you name it, you gotta keep it!)...the statue, would be in a different place in the house. She assumes my dad is getting a bit crazy and just tells him to pick a place for it and leave it alone. 
  
  
  
  
My dad has no idea what she's talking about and assumed she moved it. Yes, my dad assumed my mom moved it when she'd be out of the house for days on end. My dad is a great guy, sometimes though, his logic isn't so... logical.
  
  
  
The statue keeps moving every few days, in the closet, out of the closet. On the kitchen counter in the morning. At the door to the patio. My mother at this time has given up reasoning with my dad and just keeps replacing it back where it should be. On the entry way table... as a key-bowl. 

  
  
 
It stops moving when my mom get's pregnant with my eldest brother. This is 1977. Remember how I said they got it on Guam in or around the early 70's? Yeah, so lets guesstimate 6 years at this point. Fun. Times. However, it stopped, my mom is glad my dad is growing up, because, raising one kid would be hard enough, let a lone an infant and a man-boy.
  
  
  
My parents get a kitten in the interim while they wait for my mom to give birth. The kitten never goes near the entry way. The kitten sees a reflection of Koschitzky in a mirror, it freaks out and hides. My dad gets mauled by said kitten when he was holding him and walking to unlock the front door. Kitten hates Koschitzky.
  
  
  
Baby was born, everything is bliss. Not really. Never bliss. Mom is snappish a lot, gets stir crazy, starts to attend college on off time to earn a Microbiology degree. Last semester of school, she gets pregnant again with my second eldest brother. They move to a house in Camarillo. Koschitzky is placed in my parents’ closet. Mom and dad get another cat.
  
  
  
Bliss. Not really. Never ever bliss. My second eldest brother, as a toddler, was a trouble-maker and would regularly scare my mom to death. Which I guess she's used to, but out of practice. She hadn't been out 'Ghost Hunting' since before she was pregnant with the oldest child. My second eldest brother hides. Hides in their closet. He starts to cry and my mom hears a door slam and my brother is now screaming like a pealed weasel. My mom tracks him down to their closet and the closet door is jammed. She thinks he was lying against the door and tries to tell the little baby to get away from the door. My mom then remembers that the door opens towards her. By that time, the screaming had stopped and just low moans and whimpers. The door un-jams and my brother is curled up with his hands over his eyes and five small scratches on his arms. Koschitzky is lying on its side two feet away from him. 
  
  
  
  
Needless to say, my second eldest brother was well-behaved for a while afterward, and my mother had put Koschitzky into a box in her closet, and gates the walkway to their bedroom so wandering kids don't get stuck in the closet. She figured she had ignored a mini-earthquake, shifting the door and spilling the statue from its perch at the top of the closet. My mother is rational. My mother is very *very* rational. 
  
  
  
She gets pregnant with me. At that time, my oldest brother is around 7, the second eldest is 3. My mom starts having fevered nightmares of a box chittering and scratching. Of finding my brother bled out from bunches of 'five tiny scratches' all over his body. My mom thinks she's allergic to me. That's all. Body chemistry, hormones and possibly an allergy to the baby inside her. Nothing more. Normal stuff. 
  
  
  
I am born and everything is bliss. For exactly three days. Then, nothing is ever *ever* **ever** bliss. The first cat gets hit by a car in front of my oldest brother. My second eldest brother is nearly kidnapped from a shopping cart. The next year, I'm still in a crib and a bookshelf nearly falls on me during the August 4th 1985 earthquake. 
  
  
  
  
My parents stick it out another few years, then my dad gets a job at Boeing in Washington State, and we move up north.
  
  
  
  
Koschitzky is moved from his box to a shelf in the garage of a house my parents had built for their little family. My mom throws herself into her work as a microbiologist at a hospital. My dad works long hours at Boeing. The boys are left to look after themselves for most of the day. Every day, when not in school, my oldest brother gets into comics and becomes a bit of a shut-in. The second eldest gets into technology. Playing Nintendo; messing around with a beast of a computer. (What type? No idea, I know it was a green and black screen DOS-monster.) He takes it apart, puts it back together, he's a whiz with the computers and game systems. He sets the clock on the VCR at 8 years old. I become the artist of the family. Drawing, painting, doodling. I stay in make believe mode for a long time. Oh, something I forgot to mention, it is unrelated I'm sure, but... I never spoke, never made a sound until I was 4. Everybody thought I was, slow. Special? Let us call a spade a spade and say, retarded. I'm not, I don't think. But, I was certainly mute for the first few years of my life.

32,I was alone when it came for me... [True Story],1285048065,"I grew up a small-town girl in Washington State. Our house was a three-story farmhouse in the middle of the forest. Tall evergreen trees surrounded the cedar-sided home with its tiny dandelion-filled yard, and it was a drive of a half mile to get to our mailbox and the nearest paved road. Being Washington, the sky was perpetually cloudy.

It often rained.

Starting in elementary school, I was allowed to stay home alone. I had multiple, younger siblings who spent the evenings in day-care... it was a good way for my parents to save money. I was pretty lonely, but learned to like being alone. I loved to read, and we had satellite TV. By third grade, I'd brute-forced the passcode to the satellite and enjoyed movies like [this](http://imgur.com/rhRlL.jpg). [SFW, you pervs.]

I devoured documentaries on the paranormal, learning everything I could. I discovered the fact that poltergeists centered themselves around households with emotionally unbalanced adolescents and every unexplained happening or bump in the night was suddenly *explained.* 

Several times single plates had shattered while safely shut away in the cupboard. Footsteps happened in the night. Lights flashed out in the trees.

Every afternoon I would be dropped off by the school bus to walk the half mile home. Alone. After I scared myself shitless with scary movies, I had a dinner of Pop-Tarts, watched the sun set, spent the evening listening to the house creak, tried to breathe quietly and jumped at every tiny noise until my parents came home.

It got dark early out there in the woods.

One evening I found myself more scared than usual, and had to go through the house turning on every light I could find. The TV was on, the volume turned low, its light reflecting into the room to further banish the shadows.

Our farmhouse had a deep, covered, wrap-around deck. It hugged the house from three sides, and the front and back steps were gated to keep the wildlife away. I heard a thump as my cat jumped down onto the porch from the railing -- he was too fat to fit through the gaps around the gate. I leaned over in the overstuffed chair to look outside and check to see if the feline needed me to let him inside. The tall glass doors contained two large windows, and two panes of solid blackness stared back.

I realized then I'd neglected to turn on the porch lights. I'd also forgotten to close the curtains. Digging my elbow into the wide arm of the chair, I spun back around toward the TV and sank deeper into the chair, the wings of it surrounding me, the high back helping me to feel protected. 

The curtains were wide open on the window beside the television, and the whole room was reflected back at me in its shiny black maw.  I swallowed. The bright interior of the house -- so comforting a moment before! -- suddenly felt harsh and sharp. The illumination turned every window into a mirror. I was blind to the inky outside world. 

Mom and dad would be home soon. It would be okay. I breathed shallowly and flipped aimlessly through the channels, trying to occupy my young, scared mind. 

The rafters creaked, I squeaked. 

My cat jumped up onto the ottoman and stared at me.

MY CAT.

I slowly, reluctantly came to the realization as I stared into the feline's unblinking yellow eyes. *If he's in here, then what's...?*

Another thump, louder than the first diverted my cat's attention to the back door. He leaned to the side on the ottoman, craning his neck to peek around me to see what was at the glass doors.

The doorknob rattled. I froze.

The lock wiggled gently at first, then a little more forcefully. It was locked.

My cat trembled a little as he stared. My body was like marble. All I could do was gaze into those yellow eyes, desperate for some sort of reflection, a clue as to what was rattling my back door.

RATTLE RATTLE THUMP THUMP THUMP

The door began to shake in its doorframe. Forward, back, SLAM SLAM SLAM, the weatherstripping swishing against the floor as an inhuman force pushed the locks to what must be their breaking point.

A final thump.

Then silence.

I felt a scream bubbling at my throat and clapped my hands across my mouth, afraid to draw the entity's attention to me.

*I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.* I thought it in my head like a mantra, trying to calm my brain and allow the creature to go away.

Through the thumping of my heartbeat I slowly began to discern the footsteps. 

Thump. Thump. Thump.

*I don't believe. I don't believe. I don't believe.*

Heavy footsteps circled the deck, coming to stop in front of the wide window in front of me. I trained my wide, fright-filled eyes on the television, the flickering images failing to register in my mind. I tried to pretend the thing away.

Not a single shadow was visible in the brightly lit window. Nothing to give away the shape of the creature outside.

Minutes passed, maybe hours. 

The crackle of gravel on the driveway eventually broke the silence, and the headlights of my parents' car lit up the front window. 

It was empty. I was alone.

33,My reoccurring nightmare,1285042640,"So i was spending the night at my boyfriends house a while ago, and hadn't told him that i had been having the same dream almost every night for about a month. Well, sure enough, when we went to sleep, I had the same dream, but with a slightly different ending:  
  
it starts off with me on an empty staircase (like one in a parking garage) that doesn't end. No matter what direction i walk, up or down, it leads me to the same room. I walk inside, and to the left of the door is a bed, in front of that a tv, and on the right wall a door to a closet. it looks like a crappy Motel room. There is a little boy (who I guess is somebody I'm looking after, because i don't have a little brother) sitting on the bed.  The tv is nothing but static, and a lamp is flickering on the desk. I sit on the bed and I keep hearing noises, but the little boy doesn't seem to notice, he's just playing with marbles.  I freak out and try using my cell to call my bf, but the phone doesn't work.  I start to panic. The closet door  opens, and it is pitch black... but I'm too scared to close it. The boy looks up at me, and gets on the floor and crawls under the bed.  The marbles then gather to the center of the bed and I hear the boy crying.  I run out of the room and onto the stairs.  I run as fast as I can but am being followed by a girl (why the fuck are little dead ghost girls so scary??). I keep running and running but keep coming back to the same room. The next thing I know I'm in a giant pool of water with a grate above my head as the only way out.  This is where it gets to be like The Ring (i know, gay) in that it feels like I somehow need to help the girl in order to live.  I never know what i do in order to escape, but I get out of the water and end up in a hallway. here is where my dream usually ends, but this time, this happened: the little girl walks out from behind a corner, and pulls something from behind  her back. I look at it, and it's my bf's severed head. I look at her, and see that the little girl is actually me.  
  
Back in reality, my bf is trying to wake me up because i am tossing around, crying, and moaning.

34,Slender Man... I can't stop...,1285028578,"I was fascinated by The Slender Man when I came across the stories of him.  I hadn't even heard of him until I started lurking /r/nosleep a couple of weeks ago.  Yesterday, for some reason, I started looking up everything I could about The Slender Man, from his origins on Something Awful to the various ARG/video series posted on YouTube.  Now, I can't stop thinking about him.  I know he was made up on the SA forums.  I know it's was a generated meme that blew up into an internet urban legend, but that hasn't stopped me from being jumpier than normal.  

I drew [this](http://i.imgur.com/9Yvrb.jpg) today while at work.  There's something about him that fascinates and terrifies me.  I know it's probably been discussed ad naseum, but the idea of him does hit some kind of nerve with me.  Well, if you guys like that one, and if I come up with more, i'll post them here.  I'm considering using a charcoal medium in the future.

38,what the home remembers,1284954828,"i find spooky stuff fascinating. i'm not at all sensitive to spirts of creepy residual feelings. my stoic side will tell you publicly it's all bullcrap. my inner flaky hippy cries out that there HAS to be something else out there. 

i'm the type who would love to have a supernatural experience, but probably too blunt to catch things. it really has to slap me in the mouth. 

in highschool i was dating a girl who came from a long line of Scots who fancied themselves as psychic or at the very least, sensitive to the residuals of something beyond memory and history. she read a mean and thorough tarot, even though i admit that's 90% cold reading a person. 

she was a beautiful soul, but was terrified at me loping after the chance to experience some sort of ghastly apparition. she cringed and tried to tell me that no one should look for this stuff. it sat heavily on her and thought it ignorant to be an eager explorer.

a mutual friend had recently moved into a new home. well, new for her. the home had been part of the original 200 homes in my local community. i melt in Victorian era homes. the wood, the sounds, the layouts... an infinite realm for me to explore and i was hyper to get snooping. we walked in the door and i was giddy to get the tour. my ex stopped and stood up from untying her shoes. 

""let's GO! i want to see what's in Heather's place!""

she was rigid and looked right past me. 

""i'm not coming in. we can't go in. let's go. my mom is probably still in the driveway.""

being my first little f-ed up highschool relationship i naturally wasn't well-skilled at being a positive partner. 

""fuck this! everyone's coming over tonight. i'm not having a fight here in the front hall!""

she was a very passive and easy-going chick but she got hard real fast. ""i'm NOT staying. it's...""

""it's what?""

""it's too sad. we can't stay.""

she said it with little feeling beyond a tremulous waiver over the word sad. 

captain dickbag me just threw my hands up and walked into the house. ""you can sit here or you can come in.""

she wouldn't move. wouldn't even take her shoes off. heather came to see what was taking us so damn long to come in. i made a joke that we had someone who'd seen too many Scooby Doo episodes and was worried about the mystery of the haunted yellow house.

heather gave a laugh. ""i know, old houses are scary. come in with us and we'll take a walk. if you're too scared, hey, it's ok. just give it a chance.""

she agreed but only if she could keep her shoes on. 

into the house for a look-see. to die for. modern updates bookended with original wood floors and a staircase banister that could have supported a chorus line of girls sliding down it. 

i was in heaven but my lady was still upset. she would sit in the living room but there were specific rooms she couldn't walk into. the upstairs bathroom, the study and the sun room were all off limits. she said she couldn't stand to be in them without feeling sick. 

tour over, and the rest of the party began trickling in. we warmed my ex up with some drinks and typical nattering banter that happens when 16 year old chicks get into a room with wine coolers. we voted to chuck on a movie for a while before we piled out to be riff raff in the community. 

it was something dramatic as i know we were all very quiet watching it. booze makes for multiple trips to the bathroom so no one batted an eye if someone got up to leave. heather just asked that we stuck to the downstairs bathroom to keep the general population out of her parents room and her dad's office. 

in the lulled state of staring, i clearly heard someone walk up the stairs. there's no mistaking the creak of wood that old. left foot, right foot, hand on railing daisy chaining upwards. heather absently said over her shoulder, ""hey man, don't use the upstairs one after this time, ok?""

none of us responded because, well, we weren't the one going upstairs.

the footsteps went up the stairs, down the hall. floorboards flexing and crunching overhead. then a swift slam of the bathroom door. the thud was jolting. none of us would be that ignorant to swing a door shut like that... right? 

a friend asked, ""hey, who *is* upstairs?""

taking stock we all looked around. all 8 present and accounted for. right? or...? we had to be drunk and missing someone. nope. that's all of us.

many perplexed faces and the final ruling was that simply it was the house percolating with noises and an open window plus a gust of air slammed the bathroom door shut. i wasn't buying into it. a house doesn't churn out the sound of someone mounting the stairs to go to a specific destination in the house. my ex looked beyond nervous and stood up suddenly. 

""i gotta go home... right now.""

heather talked her down off the ledge again. it was just a noise. it's nothing to worry about... don't stress. she agreed to stay and i reaped the reward of soothing a disturbed damsel.

a night plying ourselves with liquor scrubbed the incident from our minds temporarily and it drowned as the night rolled on. 

the next morning my mom picked us both up. when i came out she was out of her truck and gawking at the house. 

""amazing! my best friend Nina lived here when she was a kid! i can't believe you know someone who has it now.""

we hopped into the truck and mom went off about how much she loved that house as a child. so much room and everything spoke to her imagination, just knowing how old it was. 

i know my mom didn't grow up very wealthy, let alone Nina. 

""how on earth did Nina's parents afford that house?""

""oh... real sad story. the previous owner hung himself in the bathroom so the house sold for cheap.""

my ex covered her mouth and i was just stunned. that noise? those footsteps? the door slamming?

39,old psych hospital - children in the wards,1284951284,"the psych hospital i worked at was a strange entity. most people see a nuthouse as a place where you get to leave. eventually. good behavior, rehabilitated...something that would allow you to get a pardon. where i was could be labelled a long-term care facility. as in, you came and you weren't leaving. 

as shifts in how one deals with the mentally ill came, so did theories on how the patients needed to be treated. from en mass wards, to apartment style to the final push out into community-based group homes, many of the patients had suffered through all these various phases.

the one major aspect of the hospital was how it had a policy back in the day to never turn a patient away. regardless of age or severity or medical cost, they were admitted. and you didn't have to be a specific age or even demonstrate some sort of disorder. sign the papers and the deal was done. not to say it was all this scenario, but a few sad cases were from this old policy.

there was even a train stop behind the grounds that people could take. in the depression the stop was forever releasing tired clusters of people walking to the main administration building. many of them bringing children that they couldn't look after any more. 

and to be clear, some of these kids had nothing wrong with them. families took stock of all the kids and decided which one would be the most disposable. the one who could be turned loose to free up some resources. can you imagine being taken onto a train with no explanation and marched into a building to sit and wait? you'd watch a parent or both of them leave the office with some papers and wonder what was going to happen. any child would hop off the chair, assuming they're going to follow their parents. but they would be held back and a new life started without any clear end in sight.

some parents tried to come up with a lie, some just walked. an old timer who had worked at the hospital talked about these passed on stories. children stunned and then screaming as they were pulled back from the doors. and that was it. 

some kids did have something ""wrong"" but that was a wildly diverse diagnosis. some had slight learning disabilities that just made them stand out as the ""dumb"" kid in the family. some were hearing or visually impaired. mentally top notch and smart, but the declaration that they were untrainable was too much for parents to deal with. 

and into the belly of the hospital they went. there were various wards set up in the 30's and 40's based on gender and age. there was even a nursery. no child would be turned away during these open moratoriums. the stories of the nursery workers deeply disturbed my mother who was a janitor at the hospital from when she was 17 until she retired.

she drunkenly spilled out a story when i was a teenager about the staff who were in the nursery. these babies were loved and tended to, just like any day care. but these kids don't ever go home. 24/7 being watched and tended to. every hissy fit documented and into a master file that grew larger the older they got. They stayed in this area until age 5 when they went to the older set which was 5 to 14. Mom  described hearing one woman who had to turn countless children over as they turned 5. She said it was horrifying to hear her sob and shake. ""they were like my own. i held them every day and then when it was time to go to the next ward we [the women working in the nursery] would cry and beg for them to stay longer. just a bit more time, they can't make it with the older kids... they can't be left alone at night because they'll cry. they can't cry because they'll be preyed on by older patients. who'll make sure they're safe?""

pulled out of one set of hands, they were set down into the next phase. a pastoral time in the nursery replaced with the learning curve of being around older patients. the women in the nurseries watched little faces peeking over shoulders, probably waiving goodbye. oblivious as they were walked into a completely new setting. and really, anyone can turn into an animal when you're left in a zoo for too long.

my own personal experience with this facet of the hospital came from my gang of guys i worked with. mostly between the ages of 30 to 55, they were mentally ill or handicapped. but that's not to say they didn't have memories and clear, albeit blunt emotions. many asked out of habit when their mommy or daddy were coming to visit. i had to be very careful and check a file before i said anything. i once absent mindedly agreed with a patient that they would come soon only to be savaged over the head with a meal tray when i turned around. his parents never came to visit after he was admitted. when he calmed down and we had our proverbial peace pipe [juice and cheetos] i asked him why he was upset with me. he thought about it for a minute and said, ""mommy daddy..."" and gestured with his hand in rounded motions. like when a kid pretends they're guiding an invisible airplane in their hand. he looked down and got quiet. 

he had pantomimed the last time he saw his parents when he was 8. they signed a paper, and that was it for mommy daddy. ",nosleep,loki_smoke,/r/nosleep/comments/dg643/old_psych_hospital_children_in_the_wards/

43,Sleep over.,1284785822,"This happened when i was about 10 or so.  My family lived out passed the out skirts of town. My friends were the kids that lived with in 5 miles of me.  A new family moved in and had a son who was in the same grade as me and we hit it off pretty well since we were the only ones left on the bus when it came to our stop.  

One weekend, he invited me for a sleep over.  Pizza, movies, super nintendo.  We set up an area in his basement for our sleeping bags.  We were asleep at by 2 or 3 in the morning.  I woke up to the sound of him getting out of his sleeping bag and walking.  I didnt think it was a big deal and he just needed to pee.  But he didnt turn a light on.  Still not a big deal since I was nice and comfy in my bag.  I started to worry when he never came back.  I called out his name but got no response.  I got up out of my bag and fumbled in the dark for a light switch but couldnt find one.  The only light was coming from the basement windows.  At this point I'm panicked because I'm in a strange basement with no light.  I make my way to his room and see him facing the wall and looking into a mirror.  I said his name and touched his shoulder but he didnt respond.  He just watched himself in the mirror.  

Being 10 this freaked the hell out of me.  I remember scrambling to find my shoes and getting out of his house and running home.  The next morning my parents made me call his parents to apologize for leaving without letting them know, but I never got a response.  The weekend went by.  On monday he didnt show up at the bus stop and didnt come to class.  He wasnt at the stop on tuesday either.  During school that day our teacher said his family moved over the weekend.  That sleep over was the last night I had with my friend.

45,What's the most creepy thing that's happened to you while home alone?,1284765566,"I'll go first. (This is happening as I'm typing this, keep that in mind.)
 
My sister and I are home alone at the moment.

Normally, I have a lot of fun alone (erm, with my sister), because I get to browse the interwebz happily and ignore the outside world for a few hours.

Everything was going okay for awhile, until I heard loud footsteps going down the stairs that are a few feet from my room. (For clarification: Me and my sister's rooms are upstairs. Her room is to the left of the stairs, about the same distance away from them as mine. My room is to the right of them. We're both in our rooms, she's watching T.V./laying on her bed, and I'm here. Also: These foot steps were the loudest I've ever heard, almost as if something was being thrown down them.)

At first I thought it was my sister walking down them, so I called out her name.

No answer.

Confused, I walked out of my room to check the stairs. No one's there, and I see my sister standing off to the left of them, just outside her room, staring.

I asked her why she didn't answer me when she went down, and swore up and down that it wasn't her. At that point I was rather unnerved. My sister is not that good of a liar in the first place, and no way in hell was it any of my cats. (I've lived with them for literally all my life and never have I ever heard such loud footsteps from any cat we've ever owned.)

Seriously freaked out, I walk downstairs slowly. Generally if I hear a noise coming from the house and I don't know the source, I grab a knife in case it's a zombie.

Seeing nothing, I stop at the bottom of the stairs and jump on the last step to see what sound it made. I could not produce a sound as loud as the one we heard, so I was thoroughly convinced my sister couldn't do it. (She's about fifty pounds light than I.)

I went back in my room and waited for another sound. 

Eventually it came, and it freaked me out even farther. But, of course, I didn't want to freak out my sister, so I started joking with her about how she shouldn't walk so heavily on the stairs.

She wasn't buying my fake, cheesy grin, and neither was I.

So now I'm sitting here, waiting for another one.

47,The Screamer Virus?,1284607444,"I'm going to describe something that I could have sworn somebody told me about, but I've found absolutely no information about it anywhere on the net, and can't remember for the life of me where I heard it initially.

Anyway, I know that it has to exist in some form, because my mind wouldn't have just conjured this sort of thing up.

Back in mid-last decade (2006? I wanna say...), there was this virus going around the web. It only lasted for a short period before supposedly it was neutralized, but versions of it still exist on the web. The virus was created by somebody unknown, probably for reasons that will become clear in the coming words. I can't remember if it was transferred through mail or through web page, but it would silently install itself onto your system, in a folder tucked deep away. I'm sure that modern virus software might be able to find it, but I remember it was a big deal that people couldn't find it at the time. Its name was also particularly chilling for what it was, spectre.exe.

The file would supposedly install itself shortly after making its way onto your harddrive, but unlike many viruses, it would not affect your files or piggyback its way onto any outgoing data. Instead, a hidden process would be running, and several months after it was installed, it would activate. Whatever you are doing on your screen will instantly disappear and be replaced by a horrible gory image, I believe of a face. A horrible wailing, screeching noise would also play in congruence to the image. The only way to make it stop was to turn off the system.

Turning it back on fixed it for the time being, but at an irregular interval, the image and sound could pop up again at any time.

When I heard about this, I was absolutely horrified and was afraid that I could have it, because of how hidden it was and how terrifying it sounded.

I can't imagine a worse infiltration.

49,(I suck at coming up with titles) My house is haunted.,1284587479,"(didn't feel like uploading a picture of a blueprint of my house, so I'll describe it please comment if you need clarification) My bedroom is on the far left of the house, with 2 windows right beside my bed with a creepy tree right outside there... YAY!, then outside my bedroom door is the hall, and directly across from my room is my parent's old bedroom, now unused due to the roof being caved in from a limb falling into the house (fortunately while we were away). If you turn to the left from my room, is the den. Right when you walk in there is an entertainment center that blocks all of your vision of the right part of the room, you can only see straight ahead from the door until your at least 2 feet into the room. I was packing up to move to another state (fortunately, after this (although my dad's staying there)) and I walked into the den carrying a box, saw my dad walking from right in front of the door so I started talking to him, telling him something clever I had thought up while I was in my room. He didn't respond so I yelled for him, and he still didn't respond. By now (maybe 10 seconds after I started talking) I was in the middle of the den, where I could see the whole room, as well as the entire room next to it. I looked outside and he was cleaning out the car.





Edit: If you need clarification, I called the thing I saw inside dad because I was completely convinced it was him, because no one else would have been in the house.

**Life goes on**

I am not sure that anyone will believe this, I am not sure I care. It's over. 

My baby son, my wife and I are alive. I don't think I can explain why I am writing this to a bloody web page. I guess I have to let it out. 

It started in September. We had just closed on our new dream home. Four bedrooms on a beautiful and peaceful 2 acre wooded lot outside Oxford, Michigan. It was a brand new house. One with no history, good evil or indifferent. Just perfect for us. 

My company had relocated us up from Houston and our housing search had been a long and arduous one. Property prices in Michigan are considerably more than Texas, so when we found this house and decided on it we were relieved and happy. I was so relieved that I deliberately did not mention to Katelynn, my companion and wife that Moshe, the 80 year old builder, told me of the tragedy that had occurred during the building of the house. I am an engineer for a major computer Integration company. Rightsizing scares me, not ghosts, at least then. 

Two weeks in we started hearing the normal house settling noises. A bump from the attic, pops in the walls and sound from the basement that could be described as squishing or splashing. Never having had a basement before who knew what were ""normal"" basement noises. As I now think about it, the first ""odd"" thing I recollect was that our dog, Blaze, cowered when we heard the water noises from the basement. 

The noises continued but their timing was strange. Always they started in the attic, then were heard in the walls and then the sloshing in the basement... 

As I mentioned I am an engineer and I didn't yet mention that my wife, Katelynn, is a Computer Systems expert, both of these professions don't allow room for a belief in luck or coincidence. So of course we started looking for the structural cause of these noises. 

We pulled up insulation in the attic, I removed drywall, and we practically camped out in the basement to ""catch"" the water noise to no avail. I called Moshe and let him know that the noises we heard were infuriating and that there was a severe electrical problem causing the noises. I thought about blaming the plumbing but figured the legal liability of an electrical problem would bring him out to the house quicker. 

Of course, he came with an electrician who certified that there was no ELECTRICAL Problem! But... as they were leaving they heard the noises. Paul, the electrician was from Oxford, and went deathly pale, he spoke to Moshe for several minutes outside the house on the lawn and left. He said nothing further to me and I have not heard from or about him since. Katelynn did ask Moshe what the noise was and what Paul's problem had been. His answer devastated both of us. Moshe said that Paul had been in the home building business at one time and had poured a basement for a house not far from our home. The building crew had heard an identical noise coming from the basement but within hours of the concrete floor being put down. It disturbed the men so bad that after two days of the noise they broke through the basement floor and found a family of raccoon. Mother and babys were dead but had obviously live on for sometime after being buried in concrete. I guess air get trapped and they were able to breath for a while. 

Moshe's eyes betrayed his thoughts. So before he mentioned anything I told Katelynn that there had been a man killed during the building of our house. She was not happy with me for not telling her before we closed. Things had happened to her as a child that made her more sensitive to these type of issues. That's her story. Katy asked the inevitable and was even more upset with me after getting the answer. 

A young man, a carpenter, had been working in the house. This was before the basement floor had been poured. He went down into the basement and started to walk across toward a backwall and had apparently become stuck in some deep mud or muck. He either fell asleep or became unconscious somehow because the next day concrete was poured in through a tube from a basement window. The only way anyone guessed what had happened was when the concrete was being smoothed part of a hand, fingers rigid, was seen coming out of the concrete. 

Of course, the body was dug up and the basement repaired. A sick feeling came over me. Of course the body was dug up. 

Moshe laughed and said you haven't anything under your basement. Katelynn and I went inside for our regular hot chocolate. The house did not feel the same. 

The chocolate tasted like hell. 

We went to bed at about ten and about eleven, respectively. Evan our two and a half year old woke us by screaming. He was not in his room, and after looking, was not upstairs at all. I raced down to the first floor and found the basement door open. Evan was at the base of the stairs and in the half light of the basement bulbs it looked to me as if something had a hold of his right leg and was pulling him. Katelynn had followed me down and screamed when she saw Evan. I was the first to reach him and for the life of me I could not pick him up. He seemed to weigh a 1000 lbs, or else he was being held. Katy put her arms around him but she had to lay down on the floor to do so. 

Again it could have been the bad lighting but it looked to me as if Evan and then Katy were lying in the floor, yes in the basement floor, not on the floor. I am not sure exactly what I did at that point, crazy thoughts about dead carpenters and raccoons crashed through my head, but I knew that they were not going anywhere without me so I grabbed both by an arm or a leg and pulled with all my might. I am six three, two hundred and forty pounds and still I couldn't get them off that floor. Both were hysterical, Katelynn never let go of Evan and I never let go of both. 

Eventually I felt something give and after a long time or a short time, I don't know anymore, I pulled at them and both ended up on top of me on the basement stairs. We left the house with no clothes or belongings and went to stay with my wife's family in Warren, MI. That was a week ago. Evan and Blaze sleep with us now. 

I spoke to Moshe a few days after we left the house. I don't remember exactly what I said, something about a flaw in the floor of the basement. He didn't believe me, but I didn't care. 

He called me back. The basement crew came to fix the floor today. They found another body. A women's body. She had been with the carpenter. Moshe said the police said she had struggled a long time under the basement floor.

53,Creepy happenings in my apartment,1284536373," I have a semi creepy story of something that happened in my apartment about two weeks ago. I should have taken a picture of it but I didn't think about it at the time. My roommates and I often write or draw things on our bathroom mirror in dry-erase marker. I went in to take a shower and wrote ""Slender Man is Watching You"". I stepped into the shower and when I got out I was slightly creeped out. Every word looked like it had veins coming out of it and the word ""you"" was completely warped as if someone wrote it with a shaky hand, it was no longer my handwriting. At the time my roommate was home but I know he didn't come in and write it because the door was locked. I left the house for work and when I came back later that day the words were changed again.

This time she kept pacing and whimpering trying to get back in the door. She is rarely scared of anything so this was odd to witness. The entire time I smoked she wanted to get back inside.

61,I'd like to share an experience I had last night.,1284455520,"Hi nosleep,

So, I haven't had opportunity (or perhaps motivation) to post on here yet, even though I've had a number of freaky experiences in my lifetime. But last night I experienced something so terrifying, and so instinctual that I have to share it. I know it's a bit long, but please bear with me. 

In part I blame the recent-ish post about the monster that lives under  the bed that only children can see. I read that and I wasn't too effected by it... or so I thought.

We've all been there: lying in bed as a kid, the room dark and inky, the cracks in the curtains casting absurd shadows about the room. In your head you know what the shadows are being cast by but you can't quite shake the feeling that something is lurking in their depths. You can't help burrowing further into your sheets. Can't let that foot stick out over the side of the bed. You're almost certain something will snatch it if you do. Sometimes even now as an adult you still think about it but it doesn't quite fill you with the petrifying dread that it used to.

I haven't felt that way since I was 12. But last night I was thrown back into my childhood nightmares as if no time had elapsed at all.

I was dreaming. I didn't know it, but I was. I was dreaming that I was lying in bed, facing the wall, and talking to my dad (who I was certain was in the kitchen) about the assignment that I have due this Friday. It was such a normal conversation, such an accurate conversation, that I was sure it was real. Sure, now that I'm awake I can't account for how I could hear my dad in the kitchen, but hey, it's dream world, stuff like that happens. 

My dad had just asked a question, and I was in the middle of my answer when I felt the thing that would wake me in a shivering mess of blind panic. You know the feeling of someone stepping on your bed, when you're in it? My boyfriend does it all the time to get to his side of the bed (he was absent last night however). The mattress depresses and the covers tighten slightly over you to account for the added pressure. 

I was in the middle of my sentence when I felt first one, then two heavy depressions in the mattress behind me. They were localised as if someone, or something were stepping or perhaps clawing toward me. The fabric over my thigh tightened. I felt the breath catch in my throat. I was sure that something was clawing itself up from under my bed and over my mattress, and it's claws were about to hook into my thigh. 

I awoke, heart pounding in my chest. I bolted upright and quickly gathered the courage to reach my hand out over the edge of my bed to turn my bedside lamp on. It was the same courage that I had mustered so many times when I was young. Any second I knew, I KNEW, the thing was going to dart upwards, grinning with sharp, bared teeth, ready to drag me under the bed to its lair. My trembling hand turned the light on. Nothing was there. 

I sat like that, staring at the edge of the bed, my heart was racing, my throat constricted, my eyes unwilling to even blink. The kookaburras were cackling outside, either laughing at my folly, or screaming a warning about what had nearly happened. 

The worst bit was that as I was trying to calm myself down I ran this story through my head. I couldn't help thinking about telling you guys. Over and over it ran, winding me up more and more into a panicked frenzy. I'm not sure how long I sat for, but the dim light of pre-dawn began to surface as I stared at the edge of the bed. Finally, sleep took me, sitting up, my body curled defensively into a ball at the head of my bed. I left the light on for the first time since I was 12.

I spent most of my day today waiting for some free time so I could type this out. Believe it or not the freakiest thing of the whole ordeal only occurred about 30 mins ago. Before I sat down to write, I looked once again at my bed shuddered at having to relive the ordeal once again. Whilst I was staring into the distance I noticed something that had somehow slipped from my focus in the pre-dawn hours: there are now two distinct frayed patches on my silk bedspread, right where I felt the claws last night.

63,Tales of a Night Sentinel,1284440159,"First let me begin by saying that I am a Cadet at the Virginia Military Institute and am bound by the nations strickest code to tell things how they truly happen, not loaded with a bunch of half truths and what not.

Having said that, my first encounter, if you will, happened oh about 2 years ago in my second year here at the I. I was the corporal of the guard that night, 2nd relief and my shift ran from 220 to 440 in the morning. So one night as I was making my nightly check of the Jackson Memorial Chapel, I noticed a thick fog setting in over the parade ground, which is never very settling at 330 in the morning. Anyway, my job was to ensure that all the doors were locked and noone was in there after hours. Well I checked the three main entrances in front of the building, all locked, and made my way to the one door behind the chapel which happened to be down two stories of concrete stairs that ran along the outside of the building. Being in uniform for guard includes a dark grey blouse, starched white pants, and thick soled leather low quarters which make a very distinct sound hitting concrete pavement. As I was walking down these stairs, I could feel chills running down my spine and noticed my flashlight trembling from my hands shaking so badly, which is no normal occurence for me. I reached the last step and reached for the door when as I stopped moving heard two more clacks of low quarters hitting pavement as clear as day come down the stairs right behind me. Shaking I spun around saw nothing and proceeded to run back up to the ground level dropping my flashlight behind the chapel. As I was moving back to the guard room at a rather brisk pace, I looked across the parade deck and noticed what looked like a deer grazing just inside the fog line. Weird for 330 AM. But I kept moving and after a few more steps looked again and saw its head perked up staring directly at me, now this animal was about 100 yards away in fog but I could clearly see it on all fours and the faint outline of its head perked up in my direction. And after what just happened, I was a little spooked until I saw it rear up on two legs and dart in the opposite direction into the fog... Im not sure if this has any historical occurence here at VMI, but I know what I saw and I was terrified, so I ran back into the guard room and stayed put til my shift was over...

Another odd occurence was with what my roommate and I believed to be the legendary yellow peril of VMI, said to haunt the third stoop in a corner of barracks with a not so bright history. The yellow peril is said to take the form of a cadet in a dark grey blouse wearing a garrison cap with the brim pulled down over his eyes and a faint yellow tinted face with a gash strewn across it. So one night during Virginias biggest wind storm in the past decade, My roommate and I were sitting our room when we heard a loud screech coming from the wind rattling the window panes in the windows when all of a sudden the windows slammed shut, which open inward and the transom above our door slammed shut which also opens inward. That alone was enough to worry us when as we moved towards the door to see what happened we both saw crystal clear a figure without a face in a cadets uniform walk past the door window looking in. We realized it was around 2 AM so we looked to see who it was and saw nothing, looked in rooms to our left and right and saw noone awake. came back to our room and saw noone there. Petrified, we both sat for a while staring aimlessly out the doorway until we both eventually fell asleep.

If any of you aver get a chance to talk to a VMI alumni, ask him what hes seen, itll blow your mind. ",nosleep,Jkinster,/r/nosleep/comments/ddj5d/tales_of_a_night_sentinel/
64,The effective scariness of short stories.,1284437940,"I am a fan of reading horror fiction.  It started when I was in high school and started reading Stephen King.  Although, most of King's work is non-horror, it was his books that turn me onto horror.  Though, with King, I always found that his short stories delivered some of the scariest stuff I had ever reads.  But, I'm not here to talk about Stephen King.  I'm here to talk about horror short stories in general and to discuss the favorites of others.  I know this isn't an account of strange creepiness that's common in nosleep, but I thought this was a worthy subject.  Nothing that I've read has ever made me keep the lights on a little longer before going to sleep like short stories.  The last one I read that did that to me was from one of Brian Lumley's collections, [The Whisperer and Other Voices](http://books.google.com/books?id=hxZ0Cd3MoOIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Brian+Lumley+whisperer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JfSOTOzFIMOB8gbgp4GoDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).  The story was called Aunt Hester.  Unfortunately, the Google Books entry that I linked cuts out the beginning and end of the that particular story.  But, I encourage anyone here to get a hold of a copy of the book.  The rest of it is entirely worth reading.

After a what seemed like hours, he came across a cabin in a small clearing. Realizing how dark it had grown, he decided to see if he could stay there for the night. He approached, and found the door ajar. Nobody was inside. The hunter flopped down on the single bed, deciding to explain himself to the owner in the morning. As he looked around, he was suprised to see the walls adorned by many portraits, all painted in incredible detail. Without exception, they appeared to be staring down at him, their features twisted into looks of hatred. Staring back, he grew increasingly uncomfortable. Making a concerted effort to ignore the many hateful faces, he turned to face the wall, and exhausted, he fell into a restless sleep.


Face down in an unfamiliar bed, he turned blinking in unexpected sunlight. Looking up, he discovered that the cabin had no portraits, only windows.",nosleep,iamlouie,/r/nosleep/comments/dddal/the_portraits/

Part 1 &amp; 2

I was out behind Peterborough S.A in old gold mining fields doing some drilling for samples in the early '80's when we broke a bit of equipment on the shaft and had to come back into town to do repairs.
We drove back out to the highway from Broken Hill to Peterborough and stopped at a roadhouse for fuel. I went in for a drink. There was a creepy silence in the place, and a woman was quietly crying at a table being consoled by two men. She was crying in that deep traumatised way that makes you not want to look, makes you speak quietly when you order, and leave quickly.
Back in Peterborough we spent the rest of the day welding and chasing parts and phoning in progress reports and being yelled at.
At dusk we hit the pub for a couple of pipe cleaners of the frothy liquid kind and drove back to the caravan park looking forward to a shower and BBQ steaks.
When we pulled in to the park I noticed a vehicle parked next to our rental van was at the roadhouse and wondered, and sure enough when I got out of the truck I heard the same terrible sobbing coming from the van next door.
I had my shower and when I came back from the shower blocks I saw a guy in his fifties sitting near the BBQ area with his head in his hands, a cigarette smoking, poking through his fringe with his face covered.
I grabbed my food and a couple of strongbow ciders and went out to BBQ dinner.
I must admit I selfishly was relieved to hear the lady had stopped crying, I thought we were in for a long night.
And, I was curious.
The guy looked up at my arrival and we greeted each other.
I started preparations and snuck looks at him. He was gone, he was lost in his head, he was not sobbing but it was etched all over his face, he was far far from ok.
I cooked for a minute or two and opened a cider on the edge of the barby....he jerked at the violent action so I said sorry, then offered him one.
He looked at it for a little too long, but then said ""Sure"" in an unmistakable accent.
He took it from my hand and said ""Thaiinks""
He said his wife was exhausted and had finally fallen asleep and if I minded if he stay around while I did the dinner thing, I said sure.
I told him I had been at the roadhouse for fuel and had seen how distraught his wife was, and he went all white with the memory.
I asked if they had had an accident, he said ""Sir, I don't know what we had"".

He falls silent, thinking .
I finish the eggs and pile them on the steaks and say ""I'll be back in a minute"" and I take the tray inside and put it on the table, I turn mine into a couple of steakburgers and head back out to the guy.
He is still lost in thought and I open a new brew and eat my dinner.
After a while he turns and looks at me and says ""Sorry"" ...for the silence.
Then he starts to tell me.
""She broke down this morning as soon as she opened the tent.....we both did, truth be told. We both did.We don't know what happened, we aren't injured, we just can't explain it...we just got in the jeep and drove, we talked it out but we don't know what happened....when we saw Yunta Roadhouse we started saying ""What happens if it is different, what happens if they aren't the same people, or if they are but don't remember us"" but we stopped in front got out and we held hands and went in.
It was the same, exactly the same, sparkling clean, cafe menu blackboard, cakes piled in cake display cases all along the counter, and as we stood there we could see the same bunch of young guys with aprons rushing around behind the counter.""
I thought to myself ""Yup, that's Yunta Roadhouse but the same as what? Personally, it was a new one on me, these 6 gay fellows had bought the place and it was an oasis, real coffee, best damn cakes I'd had in my life, gourmet rolls and sandwiches and pastries, we stopped every time we passed it which was every day because it was the turnoff to the fields we were working.
He continued "" The same guy who served us the day before saw us and said ' I told you that walnut cake was good but you had the last two pieces yesterday but we haven't had time to make more' and he laughed and Joannie passed out cold, she just flopped like a wet towel.
The guys ran out and we helped her up and to a chair and he sat with us while I tried to explain.""
He took a swig and said ""I don't drink"" and smiled .
He explained that he was a college professor from the Mid West of USA and his wife was Australian, a librarian, and that he had 6 weeks off and they were on there way to Alice Springs to visit her parents and to see Uluru.
They were driving a loaner from Joannie's sister and husband from Dubbo, complete with camping gear
The day before yesterday they had driven in toward Broken Hill and he first noticed the light, a blue light far away on the horizon. He said it was odd because it never went away, it was there for ages.
They got to Broken Hill and bought bread rolls from a deli and drove out of town towards Peterborough, intending to camp. They turned off on a dirt road and drove for a bit, and he noticed the light was back again.They turned off on a flat plain and parked at a good spot, set up the tent and he dragged some rocks into a circle and made a fire. They toasted bread and heated open cans of baked beans and spaghetti in the fire, and went straight to bed.
In the morning they heated a bucket of water and washed up, made a thermos of coffee and packed up and left.
30 Minutes after they had hit the main road to Peterborough Joannie remembered the empty cans. She had seen them as soon as she had opened the tent in the morning and reminded herself to put them in a rubbish back to dispose of in town.She asked Martin (this guy's name) to go back but he refused, they were both environmentalists , and they had an argument about whether it was worse to leave the cans there or burn fuel driving all the way back, and she sulked for a while.When they saw Yunta they decided to pull in for breakfast mostly, and they ordered the cake and coffee, ended up having two cups each and they both thought the cake was some of the best they'd ever had. The same guy told them to buy some bacon cheese quiche for the road so she did, 4 pieces.
They drove on to Peterborough, got some fuel and drove through on their way to Port Augusta and the turnoff to Alice Springs. The pies they bought in Peterborough were dry and smelly, so they got kept for a campsite burial with funeral rites.
They drove after dark again, and the light appeared on the right horizon, this time he talked about it with Joannie. She wasn't worried, but he said it bothered him because it just stayed out there at the same distance for too long, it should have diminished as he drove further.
They turned off the highway and camped in a gravel pit just 50 metres from the highway. Got out the tent and set it up, made a fire in a hole he dug with a shovel and sat around it talking for quite a while.The ate the quiche they had bought and drank coffee and remarked on how the hillocks cut the noise of passing trucks to almost zero.
They went to bed.
Just as they were falling asleep there was this blazing flash of blue light , just flashed over them and a buzz like a blowfly, all passed their senses in a part of a second. They jumped up and got out of the tent but the sky was dark. Martin grabbed a torch and ran up the side of a hill to the top and looked around, no light, nothing. He checked down the hill to see if there was any vehicles or lights but there was nothing to see.
He came back and they talked about it for a while, talked about lightning or aircraft, talked about moving camp. After an uneventful hour they went back to bed.
At this point he stopped talking as a police car pulled into the Caravan Park and stopped at the managers office. A copper got out and as he walked toward the office he looked over and saw us, waved to Martin and walked back to the car and drove up to us.
He got out and greeted Martin and got a couple of rolls and bags and a tent in a pouch out of the boot and put them on the ground. He came over and squatted down in front of Martin, and with a glance at me he started to talk to Martin.
""Mr Faulkener, as you can see we have found your campsite and have bought you back your belongings. We need to tell you that there are three sets of wheel tracks going in and out to the place you camped.All those tyre marks belong to your vehicle. There are no tracks anywhere around the site, and nothing unusual either. Both sets of bootmarks from you and your wife are visible and there is no sign of anything out of the ordinary at all.
The Doctor that you saw this afternoon has requested that neither of you drive till he checks you both tomorrow to see how you are doing, so we need you to stay around, do you understand, the doctor says you are both suffering from shock, ok?""
Martin nodded.
He got up and grabbed some bags and walked down to their vehicle and packed it in.

73,My odd dream.,1284350199,"Ok so this is a dream I had today, 9/12/10. I may not be scary to you, but for 3 hours I was going over it again and again in my head. Thought I'd share it with my fav creepers.


I'm indoors, in some kind of huge room. I seem to be floating down a river. Sort of like an in door ""lazy river"" from a water park. The room is very well let, and has a light blue color all over with some kind of line shapes carved into the walls. 
In the river is me, a companion of mine, (no idea who he is just a person I ""feel"" like I know) and several other random strangers. The strangers are floating in front of me in a group. 

On the walls in front of us as we float by are several large objects that relate to my life. A giant picture of my face, a chef coat (I'm a culinary student) papers and other things. All the time we're floating the strangers are shouting ""There he is!"" over and over as they see the objects, like seeing them gives the some kind of comfort or relief from a fear.

At one point my ""friend"" and I realize that there's a drop coming up. Like something in a water ride where the boat you're in drops into a lower level (think pirates of the caribbean if you've ever ridden that)
After we drop things get even weirder. First the water turns into mud, and the group of strangers begin to wail in fear. The room has changed into a dimly lit brown colored tunnel. Like a hallway in an underground storage place. Now instead of objects on the walls, the tunnel is littered with what I can only describe as engines. But not car engines. You know when people build up motorcycles and they have those engines with the thick swirling tailpipes? Like that but very big and loud. They're on the ""bank"" of the river, in the mud/water, and the group is seeing them and again screaming, ""There he is! There he is!"" Only now they seemed much more panicked. As I shove the engines out of the way the friend and I say something to each other I can't quite remember but it was something along the lines of this is going to get worse. 

Again there's a drop and we fall into the next level. The strangers are wailing and screaming even more. The tunnel has transformed into a dark ""temple"" setting. Stone walls, torches providing what little light there was. As we float down the river in what has now become a thick black tar, the only thing I can make out on the bank are snakes. Huge snakes rising up tall. They may have been statues or living, not sure. Some stood sideways, some stood facing us, following us. Again the group seeing these snakes screamed in terror, ""THERE HE IS!!"" Over and over they screamed it. 

Let me go back a bit. I only dream in the early morning. During this morning I went through this dream to this point twice. Everything exactly the same. The first time it ended at this point. The second it did not. 

As we float in the sludge, my friend and I talk. We agree that this has to end somehow. That it's going to get much worse. I don't see it coming but we hit the last drop. The sludge is gone and we're back in what I assume is water. There is no sound. No light save for some kind of aura, albeit small, emanating from me. Almost like distant moonlight reflecting on moving water. Complete silence from the strangers. I don't even think they made it this far.

Then I feel it. A feeling of my entire body beginning to denature. I see my hands disintegrate. In a pale bluish light my limbs turn into nothing from the tips to my body. Then up to my torso, then my neck. Then my head. Nothing is left of me. 

Then I woke up. ",nosleep,JdaveA,/r/nosleep/comments/dd1jb/my_odd_dream/
74,The Ghost of the Guard,1284346862,"I am a cadet at the Virginia Military Institute. Here we have many urban legends and paranormal oddities. One in particular that I have experienced is the Ghost of the Guard. The legend has it that if you are sleeping through one of your early morning guard shift the ghost will kick your door in too wake you up. The crazy thing is that only the person on guard will be woken up by it. One night in particular I was on guard I had a shift at 0300. I set my alarm for 0250, but I forgot to turn it on. At 0257 I was startled by a extremely loud noise. I  shot out of bed in time to see my door slam shut. I an out onto the stoop and saw no signs of life. My roommates were still asleep, and the rooms 3 doors down on either side of me were fast asleep. I then noticed the time and ran down to the guard room.

lived in the second oldest house in my area near Waco, Texas, from when I was about 11 til I was 18. I don't know the significance of this really but I feel it’s the only possible explanation for any supernatural presence. I'm not sure when the house was originally built but the rest of the houses around mine were built in the 40s and 50s so I supposed it’s older than that.
The house seemed normal when we first moved in. Only two families had lived there over the years so it wasn't like there was a high turnover rate. In fact no one really noticed or mentioned anything supernatural with the house.

However, there was a ""secret room."" This room was actually a selling point for my parents to help us deal with moving. Even though my dad was in the military we had lived at our past house for quote awhile and didn't want to move. So of course when my parents said there was a secret passage connecting one of the possible bedrooms with a secret room we became excited about the new house. My sister and I fought for it but I won because the other bedroom already had flower wallpaper up. When I first saw my room I went straight to the closet to see the ""Secret door.""

The secret door wasn't really secret, it was right in the back of the closet and plain to see. However it was a lot smaller than any normal door. Even when I was only 11 or 12 I had to squat down to get in. It looked like it was made for a child to use.
Another interesting thing was that the door handle was not really built into the door, it was just a handle added as an afterthought. This made me think it was originally just some sort of attic or crawl space door and not meant for a room. The door was lockable by key from my side of the door, the other side had no handle or keyhole. When you open the door there’s a very small hallway which is the same height as the door and not really fit for an adult, but it’s just a few feet long and then you get into the room.

The room was just an empty room added above the garage of the house. There was no way out except for the ""secret passageway"" to my closet. There were no windows, one light with a string used to turn it on hanging from the ceiling, and the room was completely white with seemingly new wallpaper. There was no furniture or anything left in the room from the previous owners, in fact I don't think the previous owners used it at all. I believe it was sealed before or soon after they moved in and wasn't touched since then, since it was pretty dusty, but who knows. The lock did seem very old and had a hard time moving as if it was rusted or the wood was warped or something.

Now my parents thought the room could be me and my sister's own little toy room or whatever when they first saw it, but after moving in they had second thoughts. I'm not sure what it was but they said it was because they wouldn't be able to hear us if we got hurt in that room since it was so detached from the rest of the house. Of course since we wanted our own secret room so badly they gave in, but said that we had to tell them when we were playing in there and we had to keep the door to my room, my closet, and the secret room open at all times when we were there. So we went on and like I said earlier nothing much really supernatural happened in the rest of the house, and not even too much in the ""secret room,"" at least not to me.

My sister began having an imaginary friend. Whenever I wasn't in there I could hear her talking and whispering to someone. I noticed that although at first she used to have fun in there that as time went on she kind of seemed sadder when she was in there. However up til now this could all be coincidence so I didn't give it much thought.

The only weird things that happened with me was at night I thought I could hear some sort of scratching on the walls behind my room, except it wasn't really with fingernails it was softer sounding. It wasn't on the door, but coming from inside the room.
Now I believe that I only heard this at night because it was quiet at night, and the scratching rubbing sound was so soft that you normally couldn't hear it. I really had no idea what it was, I told my dad once and he looked around for some animal but couldn't find any so we just forgot about it and I lived with it. Like I said it was so soft it never really bothered me. It could be some far off tree rubbing against the house for all I knew. This rubbing happened consistently but like I said I never paid it much mind, at least until my sister went into the room one night.

She knew about the rubbing too and never really said anything about it. One night though, probably about a year or so after moving into the house, the rubbing was going on as usual. I was in that limbo before falling to sleep when I thought that someone was in my room and unlocking the closet door. I thought it might have been a dream but I looked around and saw my door and closet door open, so I got up to check it out. I was a little scared but I realized it was probably mom or dad checking out the rubbing sound since I told them it still happened sometimes. I turned the light on in my closet and looked in. I saw a figure sitting in the room facing the wall. Now even when I was a kid, I had been pretty brave. I was still scared since I was pretty young, but I knew that you can't just run or you'll never know. I said ""Hello?"" and I heard ""She wanted me to see"" in what sounded like my sister's voice. The light was in the middle of the room, and it was tough taking even those few steps to get to it in the middle of that dark room. But like I said, I couldn't just leave so I just went there and turned it on. When I looked at the figure, it was indeed my sister, sitting and scratching at the wall paper. I touched her and she was crying so I pulled her up and took her out of the room. I'm really glad that I didn't just lock the door and run or else she'd be stuck in there all night (this is one reason why I never run away from anything abnormal). I locked the door, took her to her room and watched her as she went to sleep. I really thought she could've been sleepwalking or something although she never had before, and since it was over I didn't want to wake up my parents. I went back to sleep.

83,Second House.,1284193308,"Some of you may remember me from my [last thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cuez7/hey_a_subreddit_where_i_can_finally_post_this/). Well I'm back tonight to tell you what happened after we moved.

The last house was far scarier, *to me.* The next house gave the rest of my family more trouble. I had a few experiences but I'll do my best to recount the most interesting encounters of the strange and hard to explain crap.

**The well**

We moved from the last house to a new house which turned out to be far older than the last one. I don't know what type of house it was only that it use to be a larger house. The house use to belong to whoever owned most of the land around the house. It had 3 very large redwoods in the front yard big enough to build a few houses out of by themselves. Next to the house was a smaller building in the front yard which housed the well. It wasn't a large open well like the kind you picture when you think of a a well it had a large pump on it and the building built around it. 
The well house wasn't all that special but it did have one particularly annoying deal. The door to the well house would never stay closed. But rarely it'd close itself, rapidly, as you approached the well house. 
My stepdad was convinced it had to do with changes in air pressure but the air pressure sure seemed to not like us. I never liked being anywhere near the damn thing and whenever I mowed the lawn I would mow the grass near the wellhouse as fast and halfass as I could. It was a creepy little building that always felt sinister.

A typical encounter with the well house would go something like this. I walk out to check the mail. Walking down the little pathway between the house and the well house the door would from a distance be open. Regardless of whether or not I or someone else had closed it earlier. As we'd get close to the well house, not all the time but every..  maybe 1 time out of 20 the door will slam shut as we'd get close. Me and my sisters by this time are quite use to strange shit so we'd opened the well house on several occasions to see if something was inside and other than the pump and a LOT of overgrown vegetation, nothing.

**Stairs to the unreachable door** 

As I said earlier the house appeared to be much bigger at one time and was remodeled. Many clues to how old the house was were all over the place. The dumbwaiter near the kitchen, the fact that *everything* creaked. The fact that every other room looked like it was constructed at different times with different materials. 

Just outside the living room on the outer end of the house was a large area with overgrown vegetation.  The area looked to at one point be a part of the living room proper but the living room was made smaller and the area that was part of the living room was now part of a large planter with ivy and tree's and junk. 
Just outside the house in the planter I discovered a set of stairs in the packed dirt.
The stairs descended about 3 feet into the ground and at the edge of the house where the ground meets the foundation I found the very top of a door. My stepdad never let me dig out the stairwell and open the door but it must have led to a second basement under the house entrance. 

**Doppelganger** 

I had said something about this is my last thread but I figured I'd go ahead and just do a more official writeup of it. 
I lived in this house the entire time I went to highschool. The last 2 years of highschool I was often seen by friends in more than 1 place at a time. I jokingly called him my doppelganger. 

At first it was just a harmless *""Hey I saw you walking down the road the other day. I yelled at you but you didn't say anything!*"" and ""*Hey I was driving down the road with my mom and we saw you""* Always in places that I wasn't at times that I was elsewhere. 
Then things started to get weird.

My first semester of my junior year I was apparently registered twice. As I said I lived with my mom and my stepdad and during that time I had taken my stepdads last name. Well apparently I had also been registered with my legal last name. This wasn't revealed until a few weeks in to the semester when I apparently didn't show up for a class I had registered for under my legal last name.

At the time I was taking a webdesign class at a place called the Sabin Skill Center. A bunch of us were shipped off to this place from our highschool for various classes that they offered. I was waiting for the bus to arrive to take me back to my highschool when I was approached by the teacher of the broadcasting class who called to me by my first name. 

At this point I had no clue who she was but it was apparent that she knew me. She asked why I wasn't in class. After a lot of confused looks and such I was led to the administrators office while my bus was held. There I was at first interrogated about skipping class *Lots of people skipped to smoke pot at this time. I was not one of them* Sitting in the administrators office I explained that I had no skipped any class.
We went over the class rosters and found that I was indeed registered for webdesign under the name I was going by and broadcasting under my legal name. We went to the webdesign class and the instructor there confirmed that I was in his class the entire time including the first few weeks that I was going there. 

The instructor of the broadcasting class was confused as all hell because apparently I had also been attending *her* class as well. Some of the students there even knew me. 

About a year later with more strange *Hey I saw you the other day* type events I was at work one night. I went right after school and hadn't been home all day. 
When I finally came home at around 10ish I believe my mom and my sister were sitting in the living room and they were looking highly confused. Apparently this was not the first time I had walked in from outside only they hadn't seen me leave the house since I came in the first time.

Earlier that day while I was at work,... **I** came home, and walked up stairs. Both my mother and my older sister had seen me. My mom asked me how my day was and I said ""meh"" or something to that affect and continued on up stairs.

I explained that I had been at work since I got off school and I hadn't been home. Together with my mother and my sister we walked up stairs, to my room. to see if **I** was indeed home or not. 

I was not. But that was the last anyone heard from or saw of my doppelganger. 


**Creepy disembodied voices** 

I only heard this once or twice but my sisters encounters were far more interesting so I'll tell hers.

As per routine my mother would wake up my big sister in the morning and get her ready for school. When she was done she'd wake me and my little sister up. This morning was different. My sister woke up to the sound of my mothers voice telling her to wake up. She got out of bed and walked into the hallway. She then heard my mom again, this time down stairs saying *""Jules time to get up!""* Julie, doing as she was told went down stairs to help mom get stuff ready for the day. At this point she realized something was... off. 

The entire bottom floor was dark. No one was awake and it was probably 3 or 4 in the morning. She was standing at the bottom of the stairs in the black empty entrance to the house when she heard the voice again, this time it wasn't quite moms voice but off in some way. It was coming from the front door, outside the front door. She went outside and the front yard was completely dark. No one standing on the front porch where the voice had come from and not a single sound, not even crickets which were usually quite loud. 

She had the feeling that she needed to walk into the front yard a ways and as she did the whole sky seemed to fill with a strange green glow. She looked up and saw a huge green fireball streak across the sky.

Later that day it was in all the news papers, a large green fireball. 
I looked it up on google hoping there would be something but none about the same time that it would have happened. 1998-1999. But there are several articles about green fireballs.

85,Recurring Dreams,1284176952,"Sometimes when I lie in bed, I drift back and forth between dream and reality. I'd have these brief snippets, probably five seconds long, of a memory like hanging out at my friend's house or biking around my neighborhood. Only when something slightly alters from the past do I jolt out of my subconscious.

In one of these dreams it would be earlier in the day, or sometime last week, or a month ago when I would be sitting at home like I usually do. But from the corner of my eye I see a door slowly and silently drifting open, but before I can see what stands behind it I find myself back in my bedroom. This has happened to me several times in my life.

But what happens when I don't wake up? What happens when I sleep long enough for it to reach me? For some reason it's one of the scariest thoughts I've ever had.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/dcdj1/recurring_dreams/
86,You can never be too careful,1284172843,"I was reading another redditor's story and it reminded me of something that happened when I was a kid.

When I was in middle school, I had a sleepover with six or seven girlfriends.  Like you do at that age, we stayed up late telling scary stories and gossiping.  I don't remember what time it was but at some point someone said ""did you hear that?""  and we all got really quiet.  My friend said she heard something in the kitchen.  To help you visualize, we were in the living room and it connects to the kitchen.  The kitchen also has a little window that allows people in each room to see and talk to each other.

Of course, someone else whispers ""I saw something move!"" and we get even quieter (if that's possible).  I don't remember if we went to investigate or if there were more claims about sights or sounds.  What I distinctly remember is that we were all pretty creeped out, stayed in a giant blob whispering and eventually fell asleep huddled really close together.  

The next day I woke up to my mom saying ""call the police.""  Apparently one of my parents forgot to close the garage the day before.  What my friends and I had seen and heard was someone coming into the house, grabbing my mom's purse that had been sitting in the kitchen and stealing her car.   I remember the cops dusted for fingerprints on the garage door.  I also vaguely recall a cop (or maybe a friend of my parents?)  saying that my sleepover was probably the reason nothing else was taken.

91,Strange noises that wake me up,1284156215,"I feel like this is kind of lame compared to some of the stories I've read here but. . . . a few weeks ago, I woke up to the sound of someone POUNDING on my front door.  It had to have been about 4.30 in the morning?  I'm a super deep sleeper so I know that this had to be loud.  In the second it takes me to wake up, the sound stops and i'm terrified.  I don't hear anything else but my first thought is ""shit, did i lock the front door?""  My next thought is ""SHIT! I left my bedroom window open for the cat!""  After a few minutes I work up the nerve to get up and close the window.  Nothing else happens so I drift back off to sleep (completely under the covers, of course.  Rule #1 about monsters and scary stuff is that they can't get you if you're under the covers, right?) 

I would brush it off as a random dream except I heard it again today at about the same time.  I live alone so there was no one else to confirm that I'd heard the pounding.  I want to believe that I'm hitting the wall with my arm and my brain is interpreting the sound as someone at the front door except if that's what's really happening, how come my hand/arm doesn't hurt when I wake up?

92,Cold Harbor in Richmond VA,1284149664,"I don't know if anyone has been there, and this is my first submission to /r/nosleep so here it goes.

If anyone knows some civil war history, cold harbor was one of the bloodiest battles of the war. As a result, some weird go on there if you head out there at the right time. If you go around 2am, a fog sets in over the whole area, which includes a large field. The trails themselves run through a wooded area, and each time we went we would walk down the trails about a mile and sit and watch. There isn't a major road for about 3-4 miles in any direction, and you walk down into a valley as well.

Well, after a few minutes, you start seeing things. Keep in mind, we went during the winter, so there aren't any lightening bugs around. If you sit long enough, you start to see blips of light, like someone is trying to light a cigarette, which illuminate the surrounding trees and only last for a split second. Other lights start at the base of trees and sit for a second before shooting upwards.

One light started at the top line of the trees and continued for what looked like a dozen feet or so before disappearing again. You hear clanking and shouts off into the trees, just beyond your sight.

We went once with a larger group than normal, and while we stopped and waited for the lights to start, a few of our friends continued downward farther into the trails. A few minutes later, they came running back asking if we were playing a prank on them. They rounded a bend in the trail that led to turn, and saw a man standing stationary. As they approached him, thinking it was one of us, he continued around the bend. As they turned a second later, no one was there. They stopped for a second, waiting to hear if there were sounds of someone walking on the gravel and dirt trail and heard nothing.

Naturally I was skeptical, thinking the lights come from a nearby road, but there isn't anything in any direction for miles, and the woods you want into are dense; and the lights we see are local, lighting up nearby trees and moving in directions a light from a plane or car simply wouldn't.

I was taking a shower while home alone one evening, nothing out of the ordinary. I'd been in for a few minutes already. I started washing my face, and while my eyes were closed, something suddenly seemed a little bit *off*. I couldn't put my finger on it, but something had definitely changed; and I couldn't open my eyes to see what was going on, since they'd just get soap in them.

Anyway, I rinsed off as quickly as I could, telling myself that I was just imagining things. Opened my eyes... and still couldn't see anything. Total, utter blackness. At this point I don't know what the fuck is going on, but I want out of there. I manage to stumble out of the shower, open the door, and get into the hall, dripping and naked. And once there, I find that I can see; it's just dark.

1,My babysitting experience,1284069568,"Over the summer I took a job as a lifeguard.  The job was easy (no one drowned) but the hours were bad and I had found myself a little strapped for cash when my girlfriend’s birthday rolled around.

I asked my parents if they had any good ways to make a little extra (I just needed to get past my girlfriend's birthday) for little commitment.  They asked their friends and soon I found myself babysitting for the kids of a friend’s of my parent's friends while they went to a concert.  

Their house was close by, but construction on the main route had me running a little late (not much, just five minutes).  So I called the family and told them.  The parents said if it was just five minutes they were going to head out so they weren't late for the train to the city and that they would just lock the door since I had been given a key earlier in the week.

So I reached the house about 5 minutes late (I actually saw them leaving as I pulled in) and let myself in.  The first thing I see is the stairwell and at the bottom of the stairs under the wooden handrail was this porcelain clown holding balloons right next to where everyone left their shoes.  It was about 2 feet tall and with the balloons reached about 3 feet. It didn't really look menacing, just a big grin on its face.  It looked really out of place in the house which was otherwise pretty normal, but who was I to judge, it wasn’t my house.

I go see the kids in the T.V room and introduce myself.  They were a  young girl (we'll call her Mary) and her brother, ""Mark"".  They were both around 6-7.  I pull out my Wii which I had brought (best babysitter ever) and hooked it up for them with a copy of Wii sports.  I teach them how to play and when they were doing fine I told them I was going to go to the kitchen to start cooking dinner.

But Mary turned to me and said, ""No, don't go.  There's a clown.""

I asked if it was the one by the stairs and she said yes.  I understood, clowns can be scary to little kids, hell, even adults.  I told her that the clown is nothing to be scared of because it's just a statue and that I would be right back.

I left cooked dinner, and came back where we ate in the T.V room.

Then Mark asked I could walk with him to the bathroom.  I found it a little odd and asked why I would need to walk with him to the bathroom.  He also said it was because of the clown. On top of that, Mary wouldn't let us leave her alone and insisted she walked down the hall with us. 

I assured them it was only a stupid statue but took them to the bathroom door non-the-less where Marc did his thing and we walked back to the T.V room together.

After watching them play for a long while we decide to watch a movie and pretty soon it hit bed time, so I tell the kids to saddle up and head upstairs to get ready.

Again, the kids tell me they don't want to pass the clown to get upstairs.  I walk with them and when we get to the stairs I picked up the clown statue and, making a big show of it, told it to stop scaring Mark and Mary or there would be ""big trouble"".  It cheered the kids up a little bit and they sprinted up the stairs, brushed their teeth, and got ready for bed.

Once they were tucked in a sleeping I went downstairs and played the Wii for a while until I got a call from the parents checking in on their kids:

“Oh their fine,” I said, “we played Wii together and watched Beauty and the Beast.  One thing though, they are really scared of that clown in the doorway.”

“What clown?”

“The one under the stair rail by the shoes.”

“We don’t have a clown statue.”

I dropped my phone and ran to the stairs.

The clown was gone.

I sprinted up the stairs to Mark and Mary’s bedroom.

They were gone.

5,At first I thought my guests were crazy...,1283989765,"I've been working for this hotel for a few years now. This story happened when I had only been here for two months. 

Imagine any hotel at any exit from any major highway. That's pretty much where I work. Nothing fancy, but certainly not a no-tell motel. I started in September, and by November I thought I knew everything there was to know about this place. Every room, every closet, all of the weekly guests... Nothing out of the ordinary ever happened. That is, until November 16th. I checked in a regular, someone who stays with us three nights a week, every week, and everything went fine with check-in. As soon as the guest got to their room, he called back down, ""Hi, this is Mr.Brown, room 1204, you just checked me in... Yes... There appears to be blood on the floor in the bathroom..."" Of course, this is odd because our maids are very good, and thorough. I apologized to him, and told him I'd be right up to help him move his luggage to a new room. After he was settled, I went to inspect the ""blood"" on the bathroom floor. It was spotless. Absolutely clean. I checked the room top to bottom, nothing. I just shrugged it off, and went back to work. 

The next night, November 17th, I had a woman come in very late, looking very tired. I checked her in to 1204. She took her keys and hurried up to the room. I immediately got a call from her, ""Hi, this is Ms. Smith, this room is ice cold! This won't do at all, why would you give someone a room where the heater doesn't work?!"" I apologized to her, and went up there to see if I could fix the heater. As soon as I entered the room, the heater kicked on and she seemed happy so I left. No sooner do I get to the desk and she's calling me, more upset and even more frantic, ""There is *blood* in the bathroom! It's all over the floor and the bathtub, is this some kind of sick joke?!"" Again, I apologized profusely, and escorted her and her bags to a new room. When I went back to check the bathroom, it was clean. Spotless. So now I'm a little freaked out. Two nights in a row? I figured maybe she was just tired, imagining things, and left a note for the housekeepers to clean the bathroom really well the next morning.

The following night, November 18th, we were sold out, save for one room. I had purposely tried not to check anyone into it, because of the previous two nights. Right about midnight, as I'm closing my shift, a man comes in to the lobby. He explains that the other two hotels next to us are already sold out, and just begging that I might have a room left. I felt bad for him, so I told myself that I was being irrational not selling our last room, and I checked him in. He thanks me and heads up. A few moments later he walks back into the lobby, looking so pale I could swear his skin was a green color and his eyes were wide. He just drops his room key on the desk, and walks out. Doesn't look at me, doesn't turn his head, just walks out. I ran out into the parking lot, trying to find out what had happened. All he mumbled to me as he was getting into his car was, ""the room was so cold.. colder than it is outside... the bathroom is covered in blood.. the floor, the bathtub.. the mirror.. it's everywhere.."" I have never seen someone peel out of a parking lot as fast as he did. I immediately went up to the room, I figured this time for sure something would be there. Nothing. It was spotless, the temperature was fine, the bathroom was clean and smelled of bleach and Lysol from the extra cleaning the crew had done that morning. Now I'm really scared, so I called my manager to try and figure out WHAT on earth was going on. Here's the story she told me:

Shortly after the hotel was built in the 1980's, a man checked in for 3 nights, November 16th, 17th, and 18th. After he checked in, no one heard from him the rest of the stay. The day he was due to check out, a maid tried to enter his room. Instantly she was hit with a blast of freezing cold air. As she opened the door she saw a chair blocking her path. On the chair was a note, it read something like, ""Please turn around. Go downstairs and call the police. You do not want to see what is in this room. -M.K."" So the maid, obviously freaked out, gets the manager and calls the police. What they found in the room was horrific. Apparently, the man had tried to overdose on pills, and hadn't quite taken enough to kill himself, but enough that he was vomiting, in a lot of pain, and evidently had ""other"" bodily functions as a result of the overdose. Determined to end it that night, he had written the note for the maid, put it by the door, then gone into the bathroom, and slit his wrists. He had done a poor job of that, as well, and by the time he died he had sprayed blood on the mirror, the bathtub, the floor, the walls... Everywhere. And his body and the room had sat like this for 3 days. The other odd thing that was noted was that his air conditioner had been turned on full blast... In the middle of November. This was odd but was first chalked up to the man not being right after consuming the pills. It was later pieced together who the man was. He was a local business man whose family had recently died. The week before, as he was leaving for work very early in the morning, he noticed his house was a little chilly, and had turned up the heat so that when his wife and young son woke up, it would be warmer. Unfortunately, there was something flammable too close to the radiator in the bedroom, and the house caught fire. His wife and son were burned to death. 

According to my manager, every year on Nov. 16th, 17th, and 18th, the same thing happens. Guests... see things... in the room.

9,UFO Outside?,1283928740,"Here my story.

One night I was sleeping in my bedroom and all of a sudden I woke up. I live out in the country so there's always crickets or frogs making noises. But it was deathly silent. It wasn't out of the ordinary that I wake up during the night so when I woke up I rolled over to look at my clock. At this point I noticed that my room was full of light, but when I looked at my clock it said it was around 3am so there was no way that the sun was already up. 

At this point in time I noticed that its so bright in my room that it looked like day, so I started to freak out a little. I sat up in my bed, and just tried to pass it off as nothing that it was just a dream. I laid back down and right when I laid back down I heard a noise. It sounded like it was right out side of my room, It started off as a hum. The humming got louder and more high pitched. Like something was spinning out in my front yard. Its hard to explain what it sounded like but it sounded like every rotation, what ever it was, would make the pitch  increase, so did the speed it was spinning at. It started off like every second it would make a rotation, this went on until it sounded like it was spinning really really quickly and it was very high pitched. It sounded like a ""Woooz woooz woooz"" sound. 

This all took place in about a 6 second span. As the sound got louder and it seemed to be spinning at the max, like it reached the climax the light disappeared instantly and the sound stopped as soon at the light did. Everything stopped in an instance. This really shook me up because it all happened so fast, and I was to scared to look at my window. The thing is I tried to pass it off as a dream, so I was tossing around in my bed and from the next room over I heard my mom say ""Hey…. Did you just hear and see that?"" From that point on I knew that what I saw was not a dream or brain related, what ever it was it really happened. My mom is a church go-er and never lies so When I ask her about it she said that she experienced the same thing that I did.

So can someone help me rationalize what I experienced?",nosleep,Weft_,/r/nosleep/comments/dazk0/ufo_outside/

**Saturday, January 4th, 2003**

Finally got back after that avalanche of a storm. Took twenty extra minutes to keep my feet on the sidewalk, five just to get up the steps. Would've hated to crack open my skull over a thirty dollar turkey. Roads are closing, shops are closing... fuck if I have enough food to last us the day let alone through a storm.

Mom and Dad are staying for the weekend. I guess they're upset over missing me around Christmas time, but... man they picked the wrong time to come here. They're upstairs sleeping off jet lag, and I'm stuck cooking here by myself.

(pause)

I hate turkey.

**[END LOG]**

Dinner was fine. We did quite a bit of catching up; they've settled in very well after the accident. Guess that'll teach 'em to mind the fireplace... (chuckles)

Dad looks exausted. Mom seemed fidgety, but I just assumed it was their fucked sleep schedule taking a toll. They kept staring at me and asking me questions about my brother and my childhood. They probably took two bites of turkey and pushed it around their plates for an hour, then we watched a movie and went to bed.

(pause)

I can't sleep. I don't even know why I'm recording this. It's eleven-thirty, I'm tired, but something's just... wrong. Ever since they got here I've had this sick feeling in my stomach. I think it's because part of me wants to feel sorry for them, and for what they've been through, but... I don't know. Maybe it's just cabin fever but something's definately not right with them.

**[END LOG]**

I woke up at 10:30 to the sound of my parents' tiny analog clock beeping away. Why do they have to wake up so early? Is it because they have a meeting to get to, I mean c'mon at least wait till noon or something.

Mom made breakfast though, so I guess that makes up for - (sighs)  I'M COMING!

**[END LOG]**

It's 7:30 in the evening, and they're asleep. Good god.

The storm is over. The streets are completely silent. I went out to take some pictures of the aftermath. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen; just this feeling of being so cut off from the rest of the world... it's almost like the world's reset itself.

Strange how these storms are popping up everywhere nowadays. But they're sort of beautiful if you think about it.

12,old psychiatric hospital exploration,1283888203,"One of my first summer jobs was at a psychiatric hospital. In my home town, this hospital has existed since the 1890's. Built as an entirely self-contained colony, the hospital took up over a hundred acres of land. Originally, the hospital was completely full, but over the years the population got smaller and smaller as patients went to group homes within the community. By the time I showed up, there were no more than 400 patients on-site housed in 4 buildings compared to the 1000+ with 30 buildings on the go in the early 80's.
the hospital had a massive series of underground tunnels that were called The Trams. You could get anywhere and pop into an elevator without having to go outside. This was important as I worked with patients with medical issues who didn't need to get over heated in the sun... or my behavioral gang that would be a handful walking above ground. There was a high risk for those ones to attack strangers or visitors when they felt panicked. Needless to say, taking the Tram system was advisable. 

Within these tunnels old wings would be locked off so you would be forced to stick to ""active"" wings with more security. Often on lunch breaks I would bust into these abandoned wings to gawk. These were the old style buildings where it looked like One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest with the rows of beds and massive rooms to pace around in. I loved looking and getting that chilly feeling that it was very creepy to see all this history and no one would know where I was. 

Because the hospital was self contained originally, there were wings for x-rays, surgery and even a coroners office. An older nurse once took me to the all but forgotten equipment room on lunch to show me what was still collecting dust. Most of the stuff was antiquated and was useless to sell [who wants 2nd hand surgical equipment?!] so nothing was done with it. We looked at bone saws that were still caked with dust/debris from cutting open chest bones or the top of skulls. And many items would be out-dated restraints or tools to subdue patients. Most wouldn't have been any different than something out of Bedlam in the middle ages, none of which I would put on an animal, let alone a suffering person. 

Walking back from the old equipment room my guide had to take a separate tunnel to get back to her wing and I kept going to the south ward where I needed to come top side. I had made great strides breaking into doors to check them out but still had a few more spots to check out. Feeling adventurous I opened a door that surprisingly didn't require me to jimmy the lock. [I'm no MacGuyver, these locks were ancient and it was more knocking rust off them to get them to yield] I came to a set of stairs that took me even further down. Let's not forget that I was already underground with only 10-15 windows along the way to confirm it was still daylight.
Down even further I smelled dampness and ran my hand along the hand cut blocks of stone. These are part of the original hospital and would have been here the day the hospital opened. The stones were uneven and standing a stumpy 5'6"" I could reach up and still not touch the ceiling. Yet it felt eerily within reach the way it sloped down.  At the end of the hall there weren't the usual steel doors, but heavy wooden ones. The handles were all hand cast and the locks were phenomenal to look at. I went up to a door and saw that black paint was covering the tiny window. Next door, same story. My pushing and clattering into the door did nothing. It didn't even wiggle. 

The third door had paint curling away from the window. Time had actually gotten to it and it was falling off. I peeked in and it was full of old boxes and some covered items. But for all I knew had been there for many years untouched. This door had a more ""modern"" lock. [Modern is very forgiving. My skeleton key set was originally from the 40's and there was no more money to make updates.]

I pulled out my set, a wad of 14 keys that you would have to fumble for trying to unlock a door to escape a violent patient or worse still, to get into the staff bathroom after too many coffees. I lined it up and found that the door was equipped with a storage key. This was the general lock tumbled for janitorial staff and ward staff on weekends. My mom was a janitor there all her life and I scored an extra one when someone retired. She was adamant that the key would save my ass someday needing to run and hide down in the Trams. That day it was only for snooping. 

I clicked the door and pushed it. Cue the creepy groaning noise of a massive door and hinges that hadn't turned since... god only knows when. I walked in to a flurry of dust particles twisting around with the gust of air from the door swinging open. The piles were junk. Someone got lazy and stuffed crap in it to avoid using the dumpsters. I was shocked to see a little window in the room. None of the other rooms I had been in had a window cut out in the basement level. Even then, it was a bar of light, no wider than my hand. 
I wanted to know what it faced out towards and shuffled around the crap to get a look. I reached up to the bars and gingerly lifted my heft up. 

It looked to the middle part of the grounds... No one could see eyes peering out at this angle, and trapped in here, you couldn't see much save for grass and know that it was sunny outside. 

I let my hands slide down the stone wall as I hopped down. I was perplexed. The stones from the outside in the hall bowed outwards with small bumps and lumps. Below the window it seemed like the bumps were inverted. I flipped my Mag light on to really take a look. 

Below the window were small ruts and lines. When I put my hands up to them, my fingers fell into the dents and I slowly dragged my arms down. Small, subtle, but they were there. 

This was the original place where they housed all the hopeless cases. 

These ruts were from years of people being locked into the rooms desperately clawing at the stone. Pulling down, screaming, crying, and trying to reach for the window through tight bars. Faces pressed up against something so cold and of no comfort. 

I felt sick immediately. I had become so conditioned to what was/was not acceptable in mental health treatment that I was oblivious to the legacy of the hospital.

Who knows how long someone could have spent in one of these caves shrieking and trying to dig their way out? How long would it take to wear down small rivers into the stone? How many people had even noticed these marks before the doors were locked and windows painted up? 

I backed out of the room and locked up. I certainly went exploring in the closed down wings, but this moment was one of the more terrifying. I’m not one to be a flaky hippy, but that kind of misery and pain has to saturate a living space. How can something that disturbing and sad just evaporate?

17,A party got my friends house haunted for a week. ,1283823307,"This is an earlier experience happened when I was fourteen years old. My friend had hosted a week long house party while his parents were out of state attending his grandmother's funeral. We were fourteen, so that didn't seem horrible at the time, but after a house full of empty bottles, a hotwired car, an alcohol poisoned twin, and being caught by his parents friend who then hired thugs to rough us up for destroying the house, we started to see the error of our ways - legal and moral - and my friend ran away in fear of what his parents would do. 

One night, about a week later, he showed up at a get together with tears swelling in his eyes. He was pretty distraught and babbling on about how he wanted to apologize to his grandmother, and how much he loved her. Being one of the few resident 'weird kids' in our circle (read: black hair and listened to heavy music) someone asked me if I could talk to the dead. Of course, I scoffed, said no, but then, perhaps foolishly, suggested a Ouija board. 

With a self constructed black-marker-on-paper board and a shot glass we legged it to a cemetery in our area - at one thirty in the morning no less. It seemed appropriate for what we were doing. 

Everything went exactly to plan. The five of us put our fingers over the shot glass as my friend pleaded with the board to let him talk to his deceased grandmother. As soon as the glass moved, an eery cold breeze picked up and engulfed us. It could've been a coincidence given that the cemetery is located at the top of a hill, but, suffice to say, we were spooked. Shortly after my friend burst into tears and couldn't contain himself. Having accomplished what we came for, we packed up and left. 

I'd experimented with Ouija before, and it was all pretty textbook, I thought... Until the walk home. 

A block away from the cemetery, my friend and I both clearly heard car tires and a girl cry out. It only lasted a second, but I definitely heard it and we both stopped. Nobody else in our party had heard it. Slightly creeped and still high off just performing a seance in a fucking graveyard we decided to sit down in a park and do another - this time asking for a little girl (preferably the one we'd heard.) 

We think we reached her, but she didn't want to talk to anyone except my friend and a girl who was with us. The rest of us went and sat under a tree and waited patiently, regardless of it now being close to three in the morning. After a while, our friend, the girl, came back and told us we could go home. She claimed that the ghost had agreed to meet us tomorrow morning at the house were we got together to continue our talk. At the time we thought nothing of it. 

Yeah, we'd invited an unknown spirit into the house by mistake. When we contacted the 'girl' the next morning, it started out nice. The Ouija spelt out T-H-N-K, and S-A-F-E - but then things changed. It started repeating letters, M-G-M-G... F-Z-F-Z, and wouldn't say goodbye. So we left it, and laughed about how fucked that was and went about our day. 

For the next week, that house was a nightmare. One end of the house went freezing cold. The family of our other friend who lived there wouldn't go down there, despite them not knowing about our adventures at all. It was uneasy and tense all throughout the house. Fire would behave in strange ways, demonstrated by my friend flicking matches - which would turn mid-air and come back at him. Fridges and ovens would be found open. The garage door stopped working. I can't say I spent much time there that week. 

When I came back, my friend, who had been hiding at that house since running away from his parents, was clearly distressed. He looked like he hadn't slept all week, he'd lost weight, he was twitching. He pointed at the door and said ""She's there, man. She's fucking there."" 

He ended up so distressed that day that he stood in a hallway and screamed at the top of his lungs ""Get the fuck out! I don't want you here! Fuck off!!"" At this point, he just started laughing. We were hesitant to approach him, but when we did, he just smiled and said ""She's outside now."" 

All the strange activity stopped right there and then. And we burnt our home made Ouija board - just in case. The weird thing was, despite just being ordinary printing paper, once burnt it turned into a thick, black tar that stuck to the side walk. Not ash. 

**tl;dr : We had an awesome party while my friends parents were at a funeral, afterwards we got an Ouija board to say sorry to the deceased and inadvertently got our friends house haunted for a week. Burning the paper Ouija board made it turn to thick tar, not ash.**

Essentially I was trapped in a lift-actually that's wrong, it was the top of lift shaft, and I was stood on a 3"" diameter plastic pipe that felt it would give way any moment. The lift itself was beneath me and was still working, travelling up and down the floors at will. When it eventually continued to the top of the shaft, where I was certain it would crush me, I woke up in a sweat. That horrible feeling of falling in a dream was pronounced for most of the experience, the fragile pipe ensuring I never felt safe or comfortable.

  After watching a movie one night when I was about 14 I decided to turn in. So I turned off all the lights in the house except the kitchen light and went to my bedroom. I got into bed and pulled the chain on my overhead light which was the only light in my room. As the light went off I happened to look at the door to my room. There was the shadow moving slowly from one edge toward the center. As the shadow moved further in I realized that it was a hand.

I sat there frozen staring at this hand move further toward the center of my door, fingers slightly wiggling. When the shadow hand got about elbow length across it slowly retreated back and was gone.
I was absolutely terrified but I couldn't move. My mind was searching for some kind of explanation, anything. Then I was sure I had it. My little sister was playing a prank on me. At that thought I snapped out of it and got off the bed and jumped from my doorway planning on scaring her back. There was no one there.

Her room was right next to mine and our living room was one big open square with the kitchen on one end and our rooms on the other if she had ran back to her room I would have saw her and I would have heard her. I checked her room just to be sure and yeah she was asleep.

I couldn't move, aside from just barely lifting my head. After a few minutes, a ghost would fade into view in the middle of the room (not a cartoony ghost,  an ethereal, deformed figure) and slowly approach. Being as young as I was, I would always try to call for my mother, but my voice was silent and raspy. It would slowly approach, then reach out for me, and just as it touched my face, I would jolt awake. After the first few months of having the dream over and over, I started recognizing it as a dream, but it didn't change anything; it wasn't like a 'lucid' dream in which you could just will it away and have it be gone, I was forced to watch and wait through it every time. It never became any less terrifying to me, but at one point, the nightmare just abruptly stopped recurring.

28,Goodnight,1283547187,"When I was a little kid I used to spend the night at my grandparents quite often.  I remember I used to like to get into shit when they would go to bed, sneaking upstairs or to the basement to just snoop through shit.  
  One time stands out vividly in my mind.  It was around 2 in the morning(I was about 14 at this time) and I was walking down the stairs from the second floor. When I hit the stairwell I heard ""goodnight"" clear as a bell behind me.  I jolted down the stairs and busted my lip open.  I was screaming and woke my grandparents as well as my uncle (he's a fuck up) up.  I recounted the story and my grandfather and uncle grab a couple of shotguns and head upstairs thinking someone broke into the house.  Upon exploring the upstairs(attics and all) for what seemed like forever they informed me no one was up there and it was just my imagination.  
  Now this is where it gets creepy.  I mustered up enough courage to go back upstairs the next day and do a little exploring/snooping.  I go into my other uncles old room(was schizophrenic and committed suicide when I was 10.)  There was an old record player on a desk beside the bed and I checked it out.  The record player had an old Beatles album(white album, I believe) in it so I figured I would check it out.  As soon as I hit the switch I heard ""Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light Good night Sleep tight Dream sweet dreams for me Dream sweet dreams for you. Close your eyes and I'll close mine Good night Sleep tight Now the moon begins to shine Good night Sleep tight Dream sweet dreams for me Dream sweet dreams for you.""
  The records on the player to this day and I've never felt as uneasy and inexplicably frightened as I did at that moment.
  Finally, I don't believe in ghosts or the supernatural.  If anything I think perhaps the record player f'd up and jolted to life for a second but...DAMN!!!",nosleep,barcelonatimes,/r/nosleep/comments/d9bch/goodnight/

34,“I use to love Elvis”,1283123306,"Ever since I was a kid I have always been very close with my aunt.  She is a very level headed woman and really isn’t creeped out by much.  She had her first and only child (daughter) about 10 years ago when I was 25.  My mother’s side of the family is old school Italian and tends to believe in myths and old wives tales and things of the such (to clarify we are not talking about ghosts).  Regardless they have never really been scared easily and for the most part are street tough, especially the women.

This past weekend I had my aunt to my home for a visit.  She lives far away and her and my cousin came to stay at my home for a long weekend.  I recently had my first child and they came down to meet him.  My cousin has always been a nice sweet kid and as far back as I can remember I can’t recall one thing out of the ordinary that I have witnessed.  Never the less I would never doubt anything my aunt told, or has told me, about her daughter.  While my cousin was in another room watching TV my aunt and I started discussing children.  During the conversation about young children my aunt told me some very odd stories about my cousin when she was toddler.

When my cousin was less then a year old my aunt had her at the local mall.  She was in a stroller and asleep.  My aunt said she had stopped to look at something, or get something and out of nowhere she looked down and some strange old lady was peering into the stroller looking at my cousin.  My aunt said there wasn’t anything physically odd about the lady’s appearance, but she was definitely caught off guard by her presences.  My aunt said hello to the lady.  She responded friendly but wasn’t very fluent in English.  She told me aunt with a thick accent “you have such a beautiful baby…she has such and old soul”.  My aunt said her initial reaction to the comment wasn’t out of the ordinary and she didn’t find it threatening, but looking back on it she said it was rather strange.

Sometime later when my cousin was old enough to speak she was in the living room helping my aunt clean out the entertainment center where they had their TV.  My aunt said that she distinctly remembers this event.  Her and my unlce had an old drawer that they had thrown Cds into, ones that they hadn’t listen to often and wanted to be out of the way to save space.  They had decided to sort through them and get rid of the ones they didn’t want and use the drawer for my cousins kiddy movies.  My cousin was just barley speaking, but couldn’t read for sure, and was helping to move Cds and put them into boxes.  My aunt said without any prompting she grabbed an Elvis Cd, looked at the picture of Elvis on the front, started to giggle and then said in and adult manner “ Ah….I use to love Elvis”.  My aunt said she was instantly creeped out by her own daughter.  As her mother she was pretty sure that he daughter had never been exposed to Elvis at that point in her life, and knew for a fact that she wasn’t far enough developed to be able to read Elvis on the front or back of the Cd.  

My aunt said as her daughter got older she had a lot of night terrors and she would often talk in her sleep. My aunt said it was around the age she was getting ready to go to preschool, so I assume it was around the age of three???  She said one night my uncle was coming home from work late and both my aunt and cousin were home asleep.  Right before he was about to fall asleep he heard my cousin talking in her sleep.  He woke my aunt up and she said that my cousin was randomly throwing out strings of curse words in her sleep.  She said it wasn’t in a creepy voice or anything scary.  There was no context behind it, almost like she was just reading the words off a list with no meaning at all.  My aunt doesn’t curse much and she wasn’t sure where she picked up the language, but just chalked it off to exposure and since it wasn’t  a recurring problem never gave it much of a thought.  I personally found it odd when she told me. 

When my cousin was to young to really right my aunt had bought those little letters magnets for the fridge.  She was teaching my cousin how to spell out her name (Victoria).  My aunt would talk her through spelling out her name and help her slide the letters into place on the fridge.  She was doing this for a few days and said they were really just doing Vicky.  One day she said she came into the kitchen and she saw my cousin in the corner of her eye moving the letters around on the fridge door.  My aunt said  this was nothing really new because sometimes she would just fool around and slide the little magnets all over the place.  My aunt said later on while cooking in the kitchen she went over to the fridge door.  She said neatly (almost perfectly, unlike a child would do) spelled down the door was Katherine, Katherine, Katherine.  My aunt said at first she thought nothing of it because my cousin could barley even spell out her own abbreviated  name and figured it was my uncle doing something.  At a later time she asked him about it and he said he had nothing to do with it.

Finally my aunt recalled the oddest situation.  My aunt took me cousin to a new Target in a neighboring town where she lives.  It had recently become Target and now was much closer than the Target she used to frequent.  My aunt said that she remembers the shopping area where the new Target was from when she was a kid and prior to Target, for as far back as she can remember there was always some sort of business at the location.  While pushing my cousin through the parking lot heading into Target my aunt said my cousin was rambling on just talking about nonsense.  She was talking pretty well at this time and informed my aunt that when she was a kid she used to come to that very spot and get in a rowboat.  She elaborated by saying she use to bring left over bread and would feed it to the little fishes from the boat.  My aunt just thought she was talking to talk which was the phase she was in at the time.  The story really made little to no sense because there wasn’t water anywhere around and they were standing in a 300 space parking lot in front of a Target.  My aunt just blew it off.

 Fast forward a few months.  My aunt is a business owner (hair and nail place) and she has some elderly clientele.  My aunt said that an old lady (early 70’s) had brought her mother (very old) in to get her hair done.  My aunt said that she and her mother were both regular clients.  Somehow the conversation came up about the new Target and shopping there.  My aunt told the old lady and her mother that she had been there and how nice and new it was.  During the conversation the mother commented to my aunt about how things have changed so drastically since when she was a child. She then told my aunt that when she was a little girl the whole area where the Target and the surrounding businesses were was a public swimming hole.  They use to have a little beach area there and a small restaurant where you could rent rowboats for the day for a quarter.   My aunt said instantly she nearly almost had a heart attack right on the spot. 

Since then my aunt said she couldn’t really recall anything odd.  Obviously I was very interested in the stories and was prompting her for more.  She said that she would have to think about it some more and get back to me.

For what it’s worth I believe everything she told me and she is not one to elaborate.  I am sure this post will not seem as shocking to you as it does to me since it’s always different when you personally know the people involved.  Regardless I hope it translates to creepy in writing and even to people who don’t personally know my aunt and cousin.

36,Does anyone get a kick out of exploring forests at night.,1282987753,"About a month ago, my friends had a great idea to explore the forest near one of their homes.  It is about 1 am and we discovered that the flashlights we had didn't work other than these not so bright lights on the side of the flashlights but we went exploring anyways.  We ended up going through a really dark path, which led to a field, then to a hill and finally the path that went into the forest (which was a bit steep).  While going in, I get a bit behind the rest thanks to not being able to see and stepping right in a big hole along the path.  By this point I just turn around and leave with the (not so bright) light in my hand.  I thought it would be pretty funny if they thought I had suddenly disappeared and frankly I'm not a fan of exploring creepy forests at 1 am.  I didn't think about how scary it would be walking alone up the path, down the hill, through the field and worst of all through a really dark path.  I was breathing so heavily when I got to my friends house and just sat on his porch constantly looking around making sure nothing just jumps out at me. 

EDIT:
I forgot to mention something that was pretty creepy that happened.  We went back into the field near the forest to play Frisbee in the dark.  As we were following the path, we noticed something laying in the field.  My friend decides to go check it out and starts running towards it in a raptor form making noises from Jurassic Park.  As he gets near, the thing moves... He stops and starts walking back.  The thing (we think it must have been a couple but damn it was like 1:30 or 2:00 am) gets up and walks away.  He was the one that told us he thought it was a couple under a blanket, but again it was quite late.

38,A short story about the Pasco County Triangle (true),1282865300,"I was on a camping trip with a group of friends. Me and a couple of other friends wandered off and went to sit and rest in a corral, when we saw this crazy low triangular craft fly right over us. The thing was a complete triangle. Another one flew over minutes later, and shortly afterwards, we all heard a noise out in the woods.

At first, the noise had freaked me out because of what it sounded like, but minutes after we had gotten out of the area, the realization had horrified us more than anything: we all heard different noises. I personally heard what sounded like coyotes or some other strange pack of animals, while my friend said it sounded like screaming, foreign techno music. The other friend simply said it sounded alienic and that was it.

Since then, I have seen the flying triangle about six times. I live near those woods, so the location isn't too far off or anything. It's always very noisy, as if it's incredibly dense and propelled by some sort of strange energy. Oh yeah, and here's a video of it (I did not shoot this video)

If you'd prefer the white, AskReddit back ground, [go here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d5cq3/has_anything_odd_or_earily_creepy_ever_happened/)

Here's the story:

Yesterday evening, I was hanging out in my living room with my roommate. I was playing BFBC2 on the tv, and he was playing WoW on his laptop. Being 2010, every time we heard a vibration, we would both check our cell phones to see which one of us it receiving a text/call. This happens a few times; it's whatever.

There is a sequence of vibrations (nothing special, just more than one) and I look at my screen to see if it's me, it's not, so I say, ""That's you."" He looks at his phone, says, ""No, it's not me."" I look at the dining room table, and see it was my other phone* that had been vibrating (missed call). 

* Let me quickly explain why I have two cell phones: One, my droid, is for personal use, and I keep it on me. The other, a throw-away samsung tracfone, is for craigslist. I buy and sell a lot, and maybe I'm paranoid, but I don't want all the random people I sell to/buy from to have my personal cell phone number. I had also just purchased this one, as my old one ended up taking a trip through the washer/dryer. I had entered zero numbers in it (I don't enter numbers in it, I'm just clarifying this) and I hadn't called/text anyone. 

After my round of conquest had ended, I got up, used the bathroom, and then checked the phone to see if someone had called about one of my craigslist adds. I had a missed call and a text from the same number that said ""Who is this"".  I responded with my name, and my roommate immediately got a text.

When we finally figured out what happened, it scared me/us, but the logical part of my brain took over and burried all the fear: 

* The phone on the table, 20 feet away from both of us (and we're the only ones home) vibrated like someone was calling it

* The phone was actually *calling* my roommate's phone while it was vibrating

* I hadn't called, texted, or entered my roommate's number in this phone, and he wouldn't have the number for any reason

We kind of joked about what would have happened if he had answered (he was playing WoW when the phone called his, and he didn't answer it) and now I'm curious if there was a voicemail left (this happened just yesterday, and I hadn't asked). 

Has anything weird like this ever happened with your phone or any other piece of technology? We've had a few ""ghost scares"" in the apartment, but I am an atheist* and don't particularly believe in ghosts, just odd coincidences.

* I was questioned what being an atheist has to do with believing in ghosts. I don't believe in the afterlife, and don't believe in spirits or souls. I think when you die, it's lights out, and that's it. If you're an atheist and do believe in ghosts... good on ya. I don't.

If my description is confusing, ask me any questions, and I'll answer them and edit this post.

Quick edit: This isn't a throw-away account. This is my main account. I don't know if that proves I'm not trolling or making this up, but I'd like to think it helps.

**EDIT**: To clarify, when I went to the bathroom, before checking the phone, my roommate texted ""Who is this"" to the number he didn't recognize, but he didn't tell me he texted it, so I texted my name back to him.

**EDIT 2**: Just got off the phone with my girlfriend. She said last night, she was awoken by her bedside lamp turning on. I sleep on the otherside of the bed, so she knew I didn't do it (I was sound asleep, and didn't know about this until she just told me) and we lock our bedroom door at night. She was thoroughly creeped out, and still is. As mentioned before, we've had ""ghost scares"" in the apartment. I still don't buy it, though.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/d5dyy/posted_this_in_ask_reddit_but_i_want_rnosleeps/

41,Small Town Mentalities.,1282630793,"Hey /nosleep! Been reading a lot of your marvelous stories, so I thought I would share something from my you wandering around my hometown, something that I haven't told anyone since the incident. Also, this is a two comment post. I realised it's a big story.

-:-

Growing up on the outskirts of Melbourne, Australia was probably one of the best and worst things that could have happened to me as a kid. Whilst there was plenty of space, creeks, parks and bush to explore, endless hours of fun dreaming up stories, building treehouses, and generally being mischievous little rascals.

However, turning 15 brought on new challenges, as every park became dull, and every old treehouse became lame. We were hormone charged teenagers, in search of thrills, spills and a possible french kiss from the girl *du jour*. There was one area in my home town which was of particular interest to my gang of geeky misanthropes: the old abandoned mental institution.

Now there had been a lot of stories about the nut house, but like any medical facility like that, there were always bound to be stories, favourites included the reports of unmarked graves, and the release of the crazies after the facility closed in the 70's. (which is something that's good for creeping people out, given the town's reputation for being inhabited by nutters)

Even when I was a kid, I had heard stores about the crazy house, about it's apparent haunted status, which to my excitement starved teenage mind was like finding a copy of Debbie Does Dallas hidden in a copy of Titanic.

Now my cohorts at the time were a motley crew, a ragtag group of misfits, outcasts and geeks. 

Benny was the oldest of the group, a wiry stick of a fellow, who had a knack of being able to climb any wall, and get through any tiny space, infinitely handy on the many excursions that we embarked upon.

Andy was next in age order, a short stocky dude, and timid as a mouse. He tagged along with most of our adventures because his parents would leave him at my place whilst they went out of a weekend. By the end of our teenage years, he had matured a lot, and was no where near as skittish as when I first met him. For the sake of the timeline, this was one of his first outings with us, and he was still chickenshit scared of everything.

Lastly, there was Dan. Now Dan was the most level-headed member of the group, cool calm and collected, and never one to buy into any oogie-boogie or paranormal malarkey. He was also the shortest of the group, a full inch below Andy, and about 6 inches shorter than myself, who was the tallest member.

Now that you've met the crew I used to roll with, I'll begin my tale.

It started out on one of the last days of high school for the year, and as usual we would be sitting in classes, not giving a shit because all our tests and curriculum had been finished, and the teachers were fond of letting us run amok. I snuck out of one of my last class, and made my way to Dan's class, poking my head above the window, and grabbing his attention. Looking up from his latest novel, he quickly excused himself and we quickly ducked into the library to discuss plans for the weekend.

By chance, Benny was also in the library, his class was in one of the computer labs wasting time on the whole newfangled internet thing the school had just acquired. As soon as we walked in Benny's eyes lit up, as he was busy pouring over one of the older books in the school's library. Greetings were exchanged, and Benny instantaneously launched into an explanation of what he had been researching. Curious, both myself and Dan sat and listened patiently at what he had to say.

Apparently, according to some local history books, there was more to the old hospital on the hill than what we had heard from other students. This piqued our interest, and we begun plans to go investigate this evening. The three of us returned to our respective classrooms and eagerly awaited the end of the day.

3:30 rolled around and I ran to the bus, impatient to get my gear together and head over to Benny's house, where I was sure he would have turned up some more details on what could be hidden inside the old bluestone walls of the asylum. Waiting at the gate was something unexpected, my father's car parked, with Andy sitting in the front seat. My heart sank, the knowledge of having to take the timid Andy with me lowered my spirits a little. I got in the back of the car and my old man explained that both he and my mother were going to dinner with Andy's parents, and that my older sister was going to be in charge.

I almost panicked, knowing that if left with my sister, I was bound to be stuck at home, she took her responsibilities seriously. I formulated a plan, a devious plan to my 15 year old brain, and informed that Benny was having a sleepover (daggy, I know) tonight, and we were going to be spending the night playing Total Annihilation and System Shock over his LAN, and that Andy was invited as well.

Long story short, two hours later we had all convened at Benny's place, out of all of us, he had the house closest to the old asylum, and his parents were really chilled out. (I found out later that summer that his dad was growing pot in a setup under the stairs, but that's for another subreddit.) I had gathered all my essential supplies, which entailed the following:

- My trusty MagLite

- A crowbar

- A handful of broken spark plugs (For smashing windows)

- Leather gloves

- 5 metres of nylon rope

- My grandfather's Pentax K1000 with flash and loads of film.

We had loaded up and began the walk to the old asylum just as the sun went down. It was a ten minute walk, and we were full of youthful vigour, with the notable exception of Andy, who wasn't so thrilled with the idea, but along with Dan's sensible advice, he calmed down a fair amount. TBC.

44,The Abandoned Trailer,1282547885,"Years ago, when I was growing up in rural BC, I would often explore the woods behind our house. We had about 40 acres, and as such, a lot of places to explore. One day during the winter, probably about 17 years ago now, I had misjudged my direction and had inadvertently crossed onto a neighbour's property. I hadn't realized this until I came upon an old travel trailer. Some of the windows had been broken, presumably by birds flying into them, and there was virtually no trace of a driveway anymore, as trees had grown up where vehicles once travelled and snow covered the ground. Being of the curious kind, I wanted to poke around in there and see if anything of interest had been left behind, sort of like what one might find in a genuine time capsule. So I walk up to the trailer, and try to open the door. What greeted me was more than just a locked door. I heard a rattling from inside, and at first I thought it was just a squirrel or stray cat that managed to find its way inside. However, it sounded like someone, or something, was in there, as I swore I could hear footsteps, and see the trailer move as if someone were walking around inside. That was it. I ran home as fast as I could and took me quite awhile to calm down after that.",nosleep,CyanPeppa,/r/nosleep/comments/d4boc/the_abandoned_trailer/
45,"""Hey that’s an interesting coffee table you have there.""",1282534142,"So when I was in grade school (1984) one of my teachers around Halloween told the class a story.  Fast forward to today, I can’t seem to remember the teachers name, or a specific single thing he ever taught me, but I do remember the story he told the class as if it was told to me yesterday….

For sake of the story we will call my teacher Jim. …

When Jim was in college he had a group of close friends.  Every year Halloween was a big deal on campus, lots of costume parties, dorm parties, etc.   There was an old outdated dorm on the far side of campus that was abandon and used for storage.  Jim told our class that it was one of the larger buildings on campus yet none of the students were housed there and no faculty had offices there.   Because the building was old, creepy looking and off limits to students for a long time, by nature the building’s history was filled with ghost stories that were past on from year to year.   
	Jim was a Junior and Halloween time was coming around.  Jim and his friends decided that on Halloween night it would be cool to hang out as a group and do something fun.  Obviously hanging out drinking with whatever girlfriends they had at the time was part of the holiday plan.  
One night, a few weeks before Halloween Jim and his friends got together and while hanging out plotted out what they would do on Halloween.  One of the friends, who we will call Dan, suggested they take some girls to the abandon dorm, break in, give them a little tour and scare the crap out of them. 
They decided that since it was Dan’s idea and he was the bravest of them, he wouldn’t hang out with them that night, but instead head over alone and break into the abandon dorm early.  He would then hide somewhere in the building and at the right time jump out and scare everyone.  Obviously since it was preplanned Jim and his friends wouldn’t be startled when Dan jumped out and would get a good laugh out of observing the girls freak out.
A week before Halloween the group did some scouting out in the abandon dorm.  Jim told our class that at the end of one of the dark hallways on the top floor of the dorm was the strangest looking little door he had ever seen.  He described the door as wooden, dark, dirty, and about 4 feet tall.  But more importantly the door had a large knocker on it.  Jim said as soon as the group saw the door they knew this was were Dan was going to hide.  The only problem they had was that the door was sealed shut.  Jim said it wasn’t like it was locked, it had no give, leading them to believe that it would be a rather large project to open the thing.  Jim said the group quickly decided that even though it was a good place it would take to much time to open the door just a prank.  
Jim said they all then decided that Dan’s hiding place should not be preplanned, so the initial surprise would startle the guys enough so that the girls would think it was real and not suspect it to be a prank.
As planned on Halloween night Dan broke into the dorm and found a hiding place. Jim described the night to our class and said that it was the perfect night, dark and cloudy, and also perfect to setup for the prank.  They started off by telling the girls that Dan was sick and wasn’t going to make it out.  They “pre-gamed” in one of the dorm rooms and had just enough alcohol in them to make what was about to happen hilarious, but not drunk enough to have any negative issues.
Jim said that after a little convincing the girls agreed to head over to the abandon dorm.  Everything was going as planned.  Jim stated that he was definitely creeped out by the place but went along with the prank. 
So eventually the group of guys now accompanied by girls find themselves walking down the top hallway with the little door.  Jim said as they are walking up to the door he, out of the clear blue, started to tell them a made up BS story off the top of his head.  He told the girls that when the dorm was in operation a student ended up missing.  After months of searching the student’s body was found in the room behind the little door. Because of respect for the student the school sealed the door off.  And as Jim and the group approached the door Jim reached out and grabbed the knocker, giving the door three good knocks.  Within seconds three very loud knocks came from the inside of the door responding back.  
Jim said instantly everyone started quickly walking away from the door and trying to escape the building.  He told our class, as he was walking with the group he thought to himself, WOW how did Dan ever get that little door opened, and how perfect it was that Dan heard the group coming and Jim telling the group the story about the body being hidden behind the little door.  Jim said he was truly surprised when he heard the three loud knocks back, but after the initial scare he thought the prank was working great.
Just as the group is about to get the exit Dan jumps out and tries to scare the group.  Jim said that’s when the real shock and terror kicked in…  He said that instantly in his mind he put together that if Dan was behind the little door on the top floor knocking back, he could have never made it to the entrance door in time to beat the group out.  At this point Jim told our class the prank was over and he and the rest of his friends physically started running out of the old dorm and as far away from the little door as possible leaving the girls behind to yell and tell Dan how big of a jerk he was for scaring them.
	Jim told our class he ended up meeting back up with Dan and the girls a little later that night.  Jim said Dan was initially proud of how well he did startling everyone and told Jim that he thought hiding by the entrance door to the dorm was perfect because he could see everyone go into the building and do nothing. Dan thought if he jumped out when everyone was exiting at the last second would be a good closer to the little scary tour.  
Jim told our class that Dan even mentioned to him that the guys over reacted by running out of the dorm, until Jim told Dan about what happened with the little door and the knocking.  Jim said that Dan didn’t believe him but truly thought it was an interesting story.  
Jim then told our class that weeks later after Halloween Dan returned to the abandon dorm, and with the help of some other friends who were braver than Jim and managed to pry open the little door, which as suspected, was nailed shut.

  Dan ended up sanding the door down, applied a nice finish to it added legs and turning it into a coffee table.  And to top it off, right were it was originally at, Dan placed the knocker back on to the door that is now a coffee table. 
Jim ended the story by telling us… to that day whenever anyone goes the Dan’s house and sees the coffee table they are immediately thrown off by the fact that is has a door knocker on it.  They inevitably say “Hey that’s an interesting coffee table you have there” and Dan tells them the story behind it.

46,I just had the most vivid/horrifying dream in my life.,1282533177,"The dream:

It starts off with me and my younger siblings walking on a path with large trees on either side of us. The main reason I remember this dream being so vivid is that there was so many *details*. I mean, there were leaves blowing around, little kids yelling back and forth to each other as they jumped rope and hopscotched, etc.

My little brother, my little sister, and I are all heading to a *huge* park that is far-ish away from our house. (In real life, that park is a lot closer to a house we used to live in.) 

We're all skipping along, on our merry way, when I realize someone's following us.

I look behind me, and notice both of my siblings have disappeared.

I tell myself not to panic, they probably just went home because they got tired. 

And then I notice the man.

This guy is friggen' *huge*. And sweaty. And running straight for me. Panicking, I run as fast as I can to a rather large group of people. As I reach this group, the man catches up to me and holds me with his arm around my neck. (A sleeper hold, is that it?)

Suddenly, this red-headed chick with an incredible, smoking hot body  (who looked a lot like the actress from Full House that played Becky) stabs the guy through the throat with a hunting knife.

Grateful for my life, I thank her over and over again.

And then she holds the knife to my throat.

*Fuckshitfuckshit* is basically all that's running through my mind as she both mugs and I'm pretty sure molests me.

She pushes me away, laughs in my face about how I should be grateful I wasn't murdered today, and says something about how I should keep an eye on my family.

As soon as she reminds me of my family, I run back home as soon as I can, panicking the whole time.

I finally reach home after what seems like an hour, and I walk in.

My heart's pounding as I walk into our family room, and then a bed room.

My eyes wonder around the bed room until they fall on a pile of blankets beside one of the beds.

Feeling extremely jumpy and paranoid, I just know there's someone under those blankets.

I anxiously watch as *something* moves around under them.

Finally, after about a minute or two of struggling, a head pops out from under the blanket.

I see that it's my brother, but something's wrong. He seems... *off*, somehow. Looking closer, I realize his head is completely twisted around on his body, so his back is facing me, but his eyes are staring at me. 

This is the point that I vaguely remember thinking, *Should I put him out of his misery?* I mean, his head is *backwards*! Until I notice that he's still smiling and moving closer to me.

Screaming, I run into my parents' room and notice that both of my parents and my sister are sitting on the bed. Grateful for their company, I tell them about what I saw. They tell me not to worry about it, he's just an experiment they came up with to keep themselves amused. 

I then look over to the futon that they have opposite the bed, and notice that my brother, twisted head and all, is under there.

Panicking, I realize something. 

*This is just a dream.*

I came wake up any time I want.

I look at my parents and sister and start screaming to them to wake me up. I mean, I'd blow my lungs out if I screamed like that in real life. *""WAKE ME UP, WAKE ME UP, WAKE ME UP!""* Etc. etc.

The worst part? My sister and parents are both staring at me with these horribly blank expressions on their faces, like they couldn't care less.

Finally, *finally* I wake up.

Or so I think.

This time I've woken up into another dream, but have no idea.

The reason that I think this is real is because as soon as I wake up, I'm staring into my ceiling fan lights, and they're blinding me. Since when do dreams blind you with light?

Feeling relived, I get up, stretch, and head into the hallway, thinking all the time that I'm going to get me some delicious breakfast.

Happily I listen to my parents' voices coming from a part of the house, but I'm not sure *which* part of the house. I debate whether it's coming from downstairs or another hallway.

I check downstairs.

Nobody there.

I check back upstairs.

Nobody there.

*The house is empty.*

And yet, I can still hear their voices, as loud as ever. I start yelling for them, but there's no answer, and their conversation keeps on.

After yelling a little while longer, I wake up...

or so I think.

49,The House Call - Part 2,1282443618,"Thanks for the interest in my story.  I'll try to tell this part from the perspective of my dad, although his own real words are much more colorful.  This takes place when he was about 23.  Yeah I was 5.  You figure it out, haha.  So this is basically the story he told me years later about what happened when he went in the house.   I have a couple comments, I'll put them in brackets.  I'm ""John"" [not my real name].  ""Jack Stafford"" is the oldest farmer in town.
--

We were going to go up there and check the old place out.  I was tired of living across the street from your grandparents and I'd been looking for a place where you, me, and your mom could live in while I fix it up.  I knew about this house, I knew it needed work, but it had a nice private lot and a great view, apple trees all over the place, and I'd stop up and look at it ever once in a while, it seemed pretty nice.  So we tried calling the lady a few times to see if she'd sell it, but she never called back.  We even wrote her a letter, but it came back.  After a while I noticed the roof starting to go, and I knew the place was pretty much beyond repair, so I figured I'd go up there and check inside, see if there was any old furniture worth saving.  

So I got Steve, in case we found something heavy, and you, so I could show you where we almost lived, you were only about 5 or so.  And we piled into the Fiat and drove up there.  Well, you got upset as soon as we left, started whining and fidgeting, and saying you didn't want to go.  But your mom and Kate were out shopping so I couldn't leave you at the house.  

When we finally got there, you were being a real shit and wouldn't even get out of the car.  You were so upset I started to figure you were catching some bug so I left you in the car with Steve and went to just run in and check the place out.  We were probably going to have to come back without you if there was anything decent in there, and we couldn't get a dresser or anything like that on the roof of the Fiat anyway.  I guess I really didn't think there was anything in there, ya know, or I'd have just stopped by with the truck by myself after work or something.  The truth was, ever since we tried calling the old lady, the place gave me the fuckin' creeps, and I was glad she never called us back.  I wanted to see if it did the same thing to Steve, and I didn't really want to go in there by myself.  

[That part always creeps me out because my dad wasn't just a sceptic, he actively believed in nothing at all, and I'd only ever seen him afraid of cops.  There were also some vague hints here that my dad planned to play a trick on Steve if he detected Steve being the least bit creeped out, but I guess my crying scuttled this plan.]

Anyway, you're crying, so I leave you there with Steve and go in to look around.  I gotta see inside, you know, like I figure somehow I'm not going to come back up here again.  So go up there and I shove the door until I can squeeze through and start looking around.  The place is pretty much fucked, weather and animals getting in, everything rotting, didn't look like it ever had electricity or plumbing, but it's also totally empty.  Glad I didn't buy it!  Everything's either already scavenged, or just plain gone.  Living room, kitchen, parlor all empty.  

So I go upstairs to see if the rest is the same, and the stairs are pretty rotten, but I manage to get up without falling through, and there's two more rooms on a hallway.    And I don't know why but my hair is standing up on my arms and I really want to get out of there right away, ya know, like when you know you're somewhere you're not supposed to be, or like when a dog you don't know is down growling at you.  But I know no one ever comes up here, and I know the old bag is way out on the west coast, so I don't give a shit.  And I'm walking down the hall past the first room, it has no door, so I can scan the whole room as I go by, and I can see the Fiat out the window down in the yard, and the room is empty.  

[It was explained to me that despite the lengthy description, the following three paragraphs all take place in the interval of about 20 seconds]

At the end of the hall, I mean, this place is tiny, so we're only talking a few steps, at the end of the hall is another fucked up door, a few inches open, and through the crack I can see a nice old chest made of some kind of hardwood, your mom and I were looking for a coffee table and this thing looked perfect.  So I go to push on the door and it moves a little.  So I lean on it with my shoulder and really shove it, and it moves, but damned if it doesn't shove back into it's original position.  

I mean, John, this thing was warped hard against the floor, it made a hell of a sound when it moved, it wasn't swinging by itself.  So I stop and listen, for a second, I'm thinking there's a fucking bear or something in there, ya know?  But it's like dead  silent.  Real quiet.  So I shove the door once more, as hard as I can, and I kind of hear this roar?  Like not a real big animal, you ever hear a Fox fucking?  Like a god-damned screeching baby eating a live cat.  And then I hear it breathing, these deep long breaths, kinda wet sounding, like a dog, but long, not panting.  Anyway, at this point, I'm like fuck this, ya know, and I turn and start to fucking run, and I'm down the hall in like two steps, and I can hear the breathing getting louder and it sounds like it's right behind me.  And I'll tell ya I was pretty careful going up those old stairs, but I don't think I even touched them on the way down, and so I get to the front and I'm already thinking: shit, the jammed door is going to slow me down and the fucker is going to get me. 

But I'm moving like I'm flying, total instinct run, you understand?  And as I get to the door, it fucking slams open, I didn't even touch it, but at this point I don't even care, and I'm out the door.  Took all the stairs in one step, and I'm yelling at Steve to get the hell in the back of the car so we can get the fuck out of there, I never turned around until I was sitting in the car.  I swear I can still hear the breathing.  So I get the car going, and it ain't like in the movies, it started on the first try for once.  I slam it in reverse, I really beat that old car up that day, she wasn't really the same after, and we're going like 25 or 30 in reverse down the rutted driveway, and I swear the last thing I see before I get it turned around was that fucking door closing.

I got a call that night, and it was the old lady.  She just said ""Stay the fuck out of our house"" and hung up.  Then a couple days later old Jack Stafford called up and asked if we'd been messing around at the orchard place.  He used to help take care of their apple trees.  He said he got a call from that old bitch telling him to go up there and check the place out, make sure it was ok, and to tell the [our last name]s that it was not for sale and to please stop asking.  He said it was the damnedest thing, ""Check on the place? It's a shithole, what's to check? "" He hadn't heard from her in 20 years, figured she was dead.  He said she moved out of town after her husband died, there had been a big problem because the town wouldn't let her bury him on the property, they wanted to enforce some kind of cemetery ordinance.  But she had been a real bitch about it, and wouldn't let them put him in the cemetery.  The cops even were called in, but she had hidden the body.  Then one day she just left, cleaned the place out and locked it up, told Jack to stop trimming the trees.  Jack stopped going up there to check on it he said, on account of ""all the fallen apples smelling really rotten to him that year.""",nosleep,inkman,/r/nosleep/comments/d3yu7/the_house_call_part_2/
50,Wheezing in the dark,1282431356,"                 
That night I could not sleep; the haunting face had embedded itself into my mind.  
High cheekbones, red eyes, and a sharp nose. 
The air was heavy with my fear, and thick with the smoke from the burning candle. The small light from it flickered and swayed, even though there was no draft.  
My skin itched beneath the rough wool blanket as I lay frozen and nervous. My breaths came in fast and heavy, spinning my head and making me woozy. As I lay there, frozen, the door slowly started creaking. 
I hoped my defenses would hold up. The silver handle started to move, and I heard heavy wheezing coming from the other side. My knees started to shake and my teeth began chattering. 
The dread and terror engulfing me as adrenaline raced through my ice cold veins.
I yearned to shut my eyes and squeeze out what HAD to be a hallucination. It must have been. There was no logical explanation for this.
Yes, it was just a figment of my overactive imagination; induced by too much gin. 
I kept telling myself that, but the handle kept turning slowly. It was barely moving; in fact I wasn’t sure whether it was still moving, but it had moved and was almost open, and the heavy wheezing that was not my own kept constant. 
 As the handle reached opening point, I whimpered. A thud could be heard, as though a heavy shoulder had hit the thick wooden door. But the door itself did not move, and the handle was frozen in its down turned position. 
Shivers racked my body and sweat beads fell down from the forehead, and plastered my hair to my face. 

“A hallucination, that’s all.” I whispered to myself; trying in vain to calm the rushing beat in my head, and the hammering of my terrified heart. 

All was quiet instantly, except for my own gasping breaths. But I was not convinced it was the end. 	Alas, I was right. The wheezing came back with a vengeance. Wheeze in, wheeze out, wheeze in, wheeze out.
My teeth resumed chattering and my tongue squirmed in my dry mouth. I could feel my legs shaking on the sweaty sheets. 
In an instant, I saw the door shudder, but the deadbolt held up, even as the hinged on the side creaked, and as the door slightly moved in.
I knew the force behind the door was great, as the hinges started to bend the wrong way. The creature of my nightmares was coming for me. My throat was rough and chafed from the intensity of my breathing and the smoky stinging air. 
My mind went into overdrive, conjuring images of summer meadows, and soft flowers growing on hot, dry soil.
Mothers voice soothed me, my troubled mind conjuring things long gone.  Her ghostly voice serenaded me, singing a sweet lullaby. I could not recall when she actually sang this to me, but I knew she had. 
This wordless lullaby cascading over me and calming my fears.
I missed Mother. Her gentle temperament, and her gorgeous blonde hair, surrounding a round face with soft blue eyes. Tears threatened to come gushing at the memory of the tragedy of her death. 
At the age of six, I had discovered her broken body at the foot of the stairs; blood pooling all around her, and the red forever staining my memory.  
The grief returned again, but the wheezing outside my door had become quieter and slower, the handle now back in its closed position, and the candle was no longer flickering. 
I closed my eyes in relief and breathed out, as the wheezing finally ceased, and my heart stopped hammering.

51,The House Call,1282423433,"True story, names changed.

I grew up in a very small town in a Northeast state.  It used to be a big town, bigger than our state capital, back in the early 1800's, but then the creek started to dry up and the mills closed down.  A few thousand people lived there when I was a kid.  We were hill people, mostly.  And mostly poor.

So one day my dad decides he wants to see if there's any furniture in an old shack he knows way out in the woods.  Keep in mind that we're already hill people and this is a shack by our own standards.  This whole operation classier than it sounds, my dad was a finish carpenter, and often restored old antiques, our house was filled with them.  Now they tell you to leave that stuff alone, for the patina.

So his idea was that we should get anything left in the house before it rots.  No one else ever went up there.  Town lore was that the owner left for California 40 years ago after some kind of drama with her mate, refused to maintain the place, and would never sell it.  No one knows what happened to her love interest.  Standard campfire stuff, no one really believed any of it, except kids.  I happened to be a kid, though.

So one afternoon, my dad, his buddy, and I all go up there in some kind of tiny imported four seater car.  We sputter on toward this place, and I feel immediately lost.  Even though I'm 5, this is a really small town, so I know my way around, and I'm very concerned about this ""lost"" feeling, and I keep asking my dad if he's going to remember the way back.  I am getting more and more agitated as we get closer, and this is starting to freak my dad out because I'm usually a pretty mellow kid.

Finally we pull up the path through the overgrown grass to the house and it looks bad, no paint, roof starting to bend, windows all blown out, door jammed open.  I'm just crying now, and won't stop.  The original plan was that all three of us would go inside and look around.  Now there's no way I'm going in the house, and I'm too freaked out to be by myself in this place, so my dad's buddy stays with me in the car, and he goes inside alone.  He promises me he'll just look through real quick and be back in a minute or two, and starts climbing up the rise to where the house stands.

He forces the door the rest of the way open with his shoulder and disappears inside.  I quit crying now, because things seem very serious now.  And we wait in the car as I count the minutes on my watch.  Analog, with a second hand.  It's really quiet now, and it seems to have gotten late, and I'm getting really worried, because once the sun goes down I won't be able to see into the house from the car, and for some reason this seems really important.  And then it gets more quiet, the kind you forget about, because you don't hear it very often.  We can't hear birds, or distant cars, no wind, not even a jet in the sky, and worse, we can't hear my dad ramming around in the house, opening warped closet doors and testing stairs &amp; such.

I can sense my dad's buddy getting kind of worried too, which isn't cool, because I don't think he has the balls to go inside the house and get my dad if something's gone wrong.  Right about this time, he surprises me by saying, ""Okay, Johnny [not my real name], we better go help finish this up,"" and we both start opening our car doors.  I remember being surprised because 1) normally my dad's buddy was kind of wimpy, and just then he seemed pretty fierce; 2) it was the first time anyone had used my given name, in the diminutive, with that much respect.  I felt like I was going to be an important part in whatever happened next, just like one of the grownups.  For the first time, the name didn't feel debiggened, if you know what I mean.  I was suddenly being relied on for something, although I wasn't sure what.  Hard to explain that part.  And 3) I was terrified a few moments ago, and now I felt kind of floaty and brave, and I was amazed as I watched my own hand opening the car door to go confront whatever was scaring us.

Anyway, as we're clicking the mechanisms on the doors to get out and go to war (?), the old front door of the house slams open - remember it was wicked jammed before, there was a whole lot of power yanking it open this time.  Dad comes running out toward the car faster than I'd ever seen him go before.  You know that kind of running wan you take three stairs at a time without noticing?  His buddy is instinctively hauling himself into the back seat as my dad is already in the car and starting the ignition, we're in reverse halfway down the path before his door is even shut.  He sort of spins the car on the grass so we're going forward, and speeds home slamming through the gears.  His buddy, is yelling ""John!  John!  [not his real name] What happened!  Calm down, if the girls see you this way they'll freak out, man!  Slow down, man, the kid's in the car!  What the fuck?""

I was disappointed, I was back to being the kid.  But I was relieved to be away from that house, and the farther we all got from it the slower he drive, but he wouldn't talk about it, and even I could see his hands still tremoring on the steering wheel.  We got home, and my dad and his buddy went to smoke a joint (hindsight makes this clear lol), they told my mom and my dad's buddy's girl that they didn't find anything worth salvaging in the old house, and it looked like they were pretty much going to get away with not having to explain the whole story to anyone.

Later that night, the phone rang, and my dad got up to get it.  He said ""Hello?"" and then turned white as a ghost.  My mom was alarmed, and asked him what was wrong.  He hung up and said it was the old lady, and she told him ""stay the fuck out of my house.""

I learned the rest of the story years later when my dad was drunk and told me what happened in the house.  I'll tell the whole thing from that perspective in another post if you want.

52,Wake Up.,1282418276,"So a long while ago, I had a pretty weird way of being waken up in the middle of the night.

It was the Wintertime and the days were cold. I, asleep snugly in my warm bed, dreamed of fuzzy dreams that escape me right now. It was in one particular night that I was asleep when a voice, unknown to me, just uttered into my ear, flatly and simply.

It just said, with nary a whisper or a hushed voice: *Wake Up*.

I snapped from my dreams and sat up slightly as I wondered, who was trying to wake me from my sleep. I turned to my watch and saw it was only 3AM. I had school during those times, so I dismissed it as nothing more than a product of my imagination.

A week later, the same thing happened. *Wake Up*, the voice simply said, sounding as if it was close to my ear. I, now annoyed, grumbled a curse word and went back to sleep.

Now, I think that voice hates me now. I awoke today to the sounds of a voice going, ""WAKE THE FUCK UP"".

54,Waking from a bad dream to a vivid hallucination,1282273941,"Something really weird happened to me this morning. I wrote about it in a dream forum in the hopes of getting some answers, but I thought you guys might like to hear about it as well.

I was having a sci-fi dream reminiscent of Aliens (the Cameron sequel). I was with just Ripley, and we had just exited a 45-degree shaft into some kind of dimly-lit facility. We were hunting aliens. Suddenly, she pounces on me and becomes strangely monstrous and hostile. In the dim lighting, I can see that her face, a few inches from mine, has changed somehow, her eyes turned crazy, and some liquid is dripping from her open jaws (which I perceive as no longer being a human mouth). I decide this is way too freaky for my taste, and I force myself ""out,"" as you sometimes can in dreams. This led me to wakefulness.

But that's not the weird part.

The weird part is the silent, spherical swarm of insects hovering at the foot of my bed.

After a moment of confusion at this unprecedented novelty, I try instinctively to shoo it away, but I find that I am physically very weak, like all my energy has been drained. NOT sleep paralysis, merely weakness. I can lift my legs up, underneath the blanket, and when the blanket touches the swarm, some of the insects clump, but the sphere retains its shape.

I'm able to strain my upper body out of bed, but before I can shoo the insects away with my hands, they retreat and kind of *fade away* into the bookshelf behind them, a few feet away from the bed.

I think, ""Surely, I must still be dreaming."" I look at the digital clock, and it reads ""6:30."" I look away and look back several times, and the clock remains the same. Everything in my room looks normal and remains looking normal no matter how many times I ""check"" for dreamy inconsistency.

Strangely, this episode doesn't creep me out. During the encounter, so to speak, I felt no fear. Only annoyance at this swarm and irritation at my temporarily weakened state. I never felt threatened. I suppose if it had happened in the dark, things might have been different.

I decide that there does not appear to be a threat, and there's nothing I can do to prevent this encounter in the future, so I decide to just go back to sleep, and I dream uneventfully and wake up later without incident.

I don't do any drugs, haven't had any alcohol in days, and do not have any prescriptions. Didn't eat anything unusual the night before, either. I checked the paper, and sunrise occurred here at 6:27 AM, only a few minutes before this happened. I'm trying to recall just how brightly lit the room was, but I can't ""see"" that detail clearly in my mind's eye now. I just remember being able to make out all objects in the room with acceptable clarity. I wonder if I should set my alarm for 6:30 and gauge the light levels with what I remember from this morning's ""encounter.""

56,This might raise your hackles...,1282201061,"Have you ever gone on a long backpacking trip? A friend of mine used to go on solo hikes for the ""thrill"" of being alone. She would travel to remote locations that were off the beaten path, avoiding human contact for weeks at a time. Being an avid photographer, she always had her camera close by in order to snap a photo at a moments notice, generally resulting in a plethora of amazing shots; we were always eager to see what she captured. I still get the chills when I think of the night we all crowded around the table to look at her shots from the most recent trip. Pretty standard stuff: beautiful landscapes, unfettered wildlife, pristine lakes etc... Amidst the multitude of beautifully framed shots, a seemingly mundane photo nearly escaped my attention. If it were not for the audible gasp she made, I may not have even realized I was looking at something that still terrifies me to this day... Sitting on the table in front of us was a photo of my friend sleeping in her tent. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/d2wuk/this_might_raise_your_hackles/

62,Here are my stories....,1282059294,"Hello Nosleep i've been lurking around here for awhile and thought i would contribute. Please forgive my spelling and grammar mistakes.


These stories are from all across my life begining from when i was child. 

I dont remember how old i was when this happened. I had a water bed in my room. The heasdboard was against the wall and in the middle of the wall so there was space on both sides. I also hard hardwood floors. One night i was awaken to a scratching sound on the floor next to my bed at first i just thought it was my dog doing whatever dogs do. Then i realized my dog was next to me. Me being young just freaked out and ran downstairs. I couldnt fall back asleep that night so i just sat in the living room and watched tv till it was time to go to school. Now i dont know if this a manufactered memory or not but when i came home from school i swear there were like 3 claw marks on the side were i heard the scratching. I dont know if their still there or not we put carpet in some time ago.

I had a desk in my room that faced the window looking out over the street. One night as i was sitting at my desk i saw what i beleived to be a eye taking up a pane of glass in the bottom right corner. I freaked out and ran downstairs (i was a easily scared child huh?) and told my parents of course they didnt belive me and when i went back up there it wasnt there anymore. Chalked it up to an overactive imaganation. 

Shortly after that me and my sister switched rooms so i dont know if anything happened to her but i get that room back some time later. 

Now nothing has really happened at this point other then seeing things out of the corner of my eye and general uneasiness whenever alone in the house. Me and my little sister are the only ones that talk about it. Noone else seems to want to beleive it. 

Fast dorward a few years i have the room back. I must have been about 15 or 16. I ahve moved on to a twin bed that sits in the corner of the room opposite where i had heard the scratching. One night i was reading a book and directly above my head on the wall i hear a knock. I think nothing of this as this wall is an exterior wall and figured it was the wind. There are no trees by this wall or close enought to hit the house anyways. So a few days later same thing reading a book and i hear a knock but this time it was a little closer. Once again i think nothing of it. But every few days or so i would be reading a book and the knock would get a little closer and closer. Then one night i heard it it was a few inches above my head. At this point i was a little curious as i had began my intrest in the paranormal. So i knocked back. There was no more knocks from this point. 

When i was 17 i went on my first ghost hunt with some friends on halloween. I was very excited for this as i had been wanting to do this for quite some time. First we went to this graveyard where my friends sister tried to do a seance type thing. I am unsure as i was satring at her friends breasts as she was wearing a bra where the cups looked like hands. I was very happy about that. Nothing really happened with the seance. So we went to this bridge where it was said that people used to hold satnatic rituals underneath it. Well one night when they were doing this some teenagers walked over it. This made the santanic cult pretty angry so killed the teenagers and hung them over the side of the bridge. I had my camera and we went walking across this bridge cause if you do your supposed to hear the screams. We walked across no sounds no noises. Were walking an the trail right after the bridge and look out into the woods and we see 3 white shapes. They were just far enough away to determine what they were. So we all just stood there and were trying to figure out what they were. After reviewing the film i had i noticed that as we were staring at these shapes i would turn to look at my friend and as it was turning the you would see the bridge in the background. There were 3 yellow reflective signs on the end of the bridge. On the first pass by the yellow sign and the right appeared to have a shadow on it not very noticable at first. O turned back to the woods with the camera and then back to my friend the shadow had moved to the second sign. Ii turn back to the woods and then back again to my friend and as the camera passed th ebridge you could see the shadow move off of the second sign. Now this could not have been a shadow as no one was in the way my view of the sign and no one was near the bridge. In my stupidity i somehow managed to film over this video. 

I will back on later today to post more i have lilttle bit to share but i have ran out of time to type. Hope you enjoy.



EDIT: I'm Back 


On the same night as the halloween ghost hunt earlier in the night my friends had gone to a haunted train track area. The had captured what apperared to be red eyes and the video camera.


For the next few years i hadnt expericed anything paranormal except feelings of being watched while alone at home. I had moved out gotten married and moved into an apartment. I only had one wierd thing happen. I was by myself (my wife was with family on a cruise) and it was a pretty quiet night. I have three dogs and one is easily scared. I was aboutto go to bed and was callign the dogs to c ome with me. When the scared one didnt show up. I searched up and down though my entire apartment. I couldnt find her for about an hour or so. I finally found her all the way under the couch just frightend of something. I coaxed her out and the was the only thing that happened there. 

When the lease was up on that apartment we moved into a house. It was built sometime in the 50's. It didnt seem creepy at first until i went underneath the house to look around. There was a couch and a chair just chilling down there. The chair was in the corner upside down and the couch was on its back on the other side. The wierdest part was when you first open the crawlspace door about 2 feet in on the floor is a pile of empty shotgun shells. It was kinda creepy. I have had to go down there a few times. One of the last times i went down there the chair had moved from the corner to the middle of the space. That was freaky. As i am the only one that goes down there and i know i didnt move it.

Now one time i was in my room changing clothes or something and i saw what looked like the shadow of dogs legs underneath the door and the door popped open like one of the dogs was about to come in when no one did i looked around and my 2 small dogs were with me in the room. My other dog was outside so i dont know what that was. 


In this house i would also feel like i was being watched and creeped out whenever i was by myself. One night i was playing call of duty downstairs in the living room. There was a light on in the kitchen and it was casting light on the door to the basement. I was feeling a little creeped out and when i looked up i saw the shadow of a head and body move away as if it were casting a shadow on the door. I freaked out a little bit and looked around and noone was there(my wife was out watching a movie with friends).

When we were packing our stuff up to move one night i had put my psp charger on the dresser in the living room. I should also point out that my living room was carpeted and my dining room which is next to the living room is hardwood. The dresser is across the room from the dining room. I had placed the charger on the dresser and went upstairs as i entered my room i heard something fall on the ground in the dining room. So i went downstairs to see what it was and my psp charger was on the dining room floor. 

Another night which was close to the moving out date. Me and my wife were about to go to sleep on the couch in the living room. From this postion i could see the dining room, the table in the dining room. On the leg of the table in the dining room the was a reflective sticker that one of neices had put there. I saw it and then it black like someone was standing in front of it. I kept looking at it and then i could see it again i looked at my wife to see if she had seen it and she hadnt and when it looked back it was black again. I got up to check it out and was about to go though the kitchen. Our kitchen and dining room and divided by a breakfast bar. there is a refridgerator next to the breakfast bar and there is a laundry basket next to it kinda makes a walkway. I was alking though this walkway when i ran into a broom which was laying from the basket to the top of the breakfast bar. My wife had just walked though here to turn off the light and the broom wasnt there. 

On our last night there my wife was taking a shower. Now the power is out so its already a creppy feeling. I have no idea why she has to take a shower. She takes a candle with her. I'm downstairs just hanging out in the dark. When i hear my wife say i'm almost done. Which i find wierd cause she said that out of nowhere. When i asked her about she said it was because she had heard a knock on the door. 

My wifes house that she grew up in has had some wierd things happen. 
These are her stories as she has told me.
One night she was watching the excersist alone in her living room. There is a lamp that sits in the corner. It is a unused lamp thats not even plugged in. This lamp turn on by itself. Needless to say she freaked out. 

Another night she was watching tv in the same room and a ball was thrown at the tv from behind her. She was the only on in there.

2 of my sister in laws were sleeping in their room one night when both of them heard a whisper in there ear that said there names. 

My other sister in law used to have that room. One night after one of her friends passed away, She walked in to her room and she closed the door. When she looked in her mirror she saw her dead friend standing behind the door. 




tl;dr wierd things that have happen on my life.

I went to sleep around 2 am this morning.  I normally sleep on my stomach, but I was beat, so I laid down on my back.

I'm pretty sure I was asleep, but the change in consciousness from awake to sleep was indiscernible.  I was awake one moment, had a flash/dream of a photo album sorta thing with some creepy dark pictures in it that I have never seen in real life, and then I couldn't move.  I wasn't completely frozen, as I was kind of trembling, but I remembered reading on here that when you get sleep paralysis, you try to move your toes and feet, so I strained really hard to do that.  I finally unfroze, rolled over, and went back to sleep on my stomach.

I was under my covers so there were no visions or sightings of anything.  Just being frozen and aware of it, while also being able to remember things I had previously read online and enact them.

74,Shadow Fingers,1281922596,"Hello fellow nosleepers, I have had quite a few scary experiences that I'll be sharing with you guys over the next few months.


I'll start with one which happened when I was 5 (which was in 1984-85)


My mother and I were living in a duplex in Glendale, CA. One night, as I was laying in bed, I noticed moving shadows on my wall. (My room shared a window with the front porch, and the porch light was on)
After I stared for a moment, I quickly noticed that the shadows were that of two hands, which were making various gestures and movements (wiggling fingers, clasping together, etc)


For some reason I thought they could possibly be my hands, so I clenched my hands into fists, but the shadow hands were still moving.  In a last ditch effort for sanity, I put my hands under my covers, still thinking that somehow I could of been causing the shadows (pretty foolish, but I was young).  The shadow hands still kept moving around.  I made quick exit to my Mom's room.  


After running to her room, I woke her up, telling her what I saw.  Now at the time, I was deathly afraid of Freddy Kruger, so my Mom figured I was having nightmares.  She allowed me to lay in her bed.  Then the terrifying began.


A few minutes after getting into my Mom's bed, a loud knock came at the door.


BANG, BANG, BANG 


My Mom stood up out of bed, alarmed that someone was at the door so late at night. (quick note, it was a small place, so you could see the front door from my Mom's bed)


""Who is it?!"" My Mom yelled.


BANG BANG BANG


*jiggle of door handle*


BANG BANG BANG


""OPEN THE DOOR!"" a man's voice yelled from the outside.


At this point my Mom and I were standing in her doorway, looking at the front door, only about 12 feet of living room separating us from the crazed man.


The guy then ran along the side of the house, banging on the walls and windows as he did.  Then a minute or so pause as my mother and I stood in fear.  Then a voice came from my Mom's window, which was open (summer time)

""Take off your clothes, I want to kill you""


*pause*


""Take off your clothes, I want to kill you""


*pause*


""Take off your clothes, I won't hurt you""

Now my Mom started screaming all sorts of expletives at this guy, telling him to go away.  Apparently the neighbor, who had a window on the same side of the duplex as my Mom, leaned out of the window and started yelling.


My Mom and I crouched in the living room, crying, on the phone with the police.


Now, here's the interesting part.  We lived only a mile away from Richard Ramirez's (aka [The Night Stalker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez)) first murder, which took place in the summer of 84:

*excerpt from wikipedia*
""On June 28, 1984, following a night of shooting cocaine, Ramírez removed a screen and entered the window of 79-year-old Jennie Vincow, of Glassell Park, Los Angeles.[6]  Vincow's son, Jack, discovered her body the next afternoon. She was sprawled out on the bed, stabbed repeatedly, her throat slashed so deeply she was nearly decapitated. Ramírez also ransacked her apartment. Fingerprints were recovered from the window screen. The autopsy later revealed signs of sexual assault.[7]""    

Here's a Google Map view [from Glassell Park (Where Ramirez's first murder took place) to the vicinity of where I lived](
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=glassell+park+ca&amp;daddr=S+Glendale+Ave&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FQ54CAId98_z-ClZsIsvtsbCgDGV5SEI496vjQ%3BFaTTCAId2p3z-A&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=14&amp;sll=34.122179,-118.246622&amp;sspn=0.052083,0.101881&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=14)



So yeah, that's the first of my scary experiences, more to come.

80,Dream I had.,1281673564,"Hello No Sleep, let me tell you about a dream that I had. 

I had a very vivid dream in the early hours, one that I will attempt to convey to you accurately. In the dream, I was living in what could have been my old neighborhood, though in my dream it was represented as a very homogenous suburban american setting. Basically a bunch of neighborhoods with shops with a 4 lane highway going through it. You had your mixture of starbucks and autozones and whatnot, but in the dream it was all devastated as a war had moved through ala Iraq style, except that we were on the receiving end and I was part of a large group of survivors that were just trying to deal with the trauma of what had transpired. 
The danger had long since passed, and in the dream me and other survivors of the attacks were just trying to figure out how to move on with our lives now that our jobs and loved ones and future prospects were all destroyed. The stores were still stocked and our daily material needs were met, the only danger facing us now was the sheer boredom as we tried to figure out how we could move on with our lives. Each day seemed to pass with this type of sterile, old feel to it as if we were somehow living with cotton in our ears and looking through grey shaded glasses. Dismal to say the least. 

In my dream, I had another dream. A dream in a dream if you could call it that. In my dream, the group I was with were in a rabid panic. I saw flashing sirens and people screaming in sheer fear of their lives, but that made no sense because the panic and the fear was over, and the only thing left was desolation. The most dangerous thing facing us now was… nothing. 

So one day, in my dream of course, the group I’m with is slowly consolidating and we are trying to form  a coalition, the return of a government if you will. The scene was quite vivid. We were all gathered out in front of a Starbucks and there was the leader, talking and telling us how we needed to start to work together and meet goals and other types of typical pre-war normal life rah rah type stuff. Well, the group is large and it spills out from the small café onto the parking lot and onto the streets, where I find myself sitting on the hood of a shot up Escalade with its long dead occupants still inside. In fact, dead bodies and cars are quite the norm. The four lane highway that cuts through town is littered with very nice, very shot up cars with very dead normal people still inside, long since cooked by the sun and the smell of death was long abated. In the dream, I recalling talking to other people and remembering the sheer dread of it all, how individuals were on their way to work, or going to mall, or to star bucks, or whatever when the enemy fighter craft came and raked over the area killing them. People had different opinions on the concept of pre-emptive war when the shoe was on the other foot. We were the ones catching hell, being accused of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and occupying a war zone.

That was all in the past now. At this current moment, I was sitting on the hood of this Cadillac, a relic of the past listening to the leader give his speech in an attempt to tie together the new world and bring normalcy when suddenly, the Cadillac’s alarm system went off. The honking was loud and intrusive and utterly impossible but it did so, and in sequence all the other cars started going off as well, these bombed out husks of the past suddenly blaring loud intrusive honks. For a moment there was confusion as to what was going on, then somebody yelled, “OMG, its them! They are doing it!” They, of course, being the dead people who still occupied the vehicles and when he said that all hell broke loose. People were scared, frightened beyond belief and like wild cattle they started to scatter. A realization was that something was at work here, something that went beyond  control and anything they could do to contain it. The dead people, while dead, were still very much here and influencing the present. They sensed it, they dreaded it, feared it, and would do anything they could to get away. 

People jumped in cars, started them up, and started driving away, fleeing in small groups to all corners of the map. In the chaos I grabbed a close friend, who could have been a brother, and he stayed close to me. I remember another car, a Ford Taurus or something like that pulling up with four other college aged guys in it. They yelled to my buddy that they were leaving and he could go with them if he wanted, but before the words were even out of his mouth somebody else jumped in the last empty seat and yelled to “go go go!” The driver took off without even letting my buddy time to respond.    
It was then, in that chaos when I saw somebody in a old cop car fleeing with lights on, that I realized that this was my dream, the dream in a dream that I had, coming true. When I realized this, I grabbed my buddy by the shoulder and told him to hang on, calm down, relax, everything was going to be okay. I didn’t know why but I suddenly felt that fleeing was the last thing I needed to do. I motioned him over to another car, it could have been a Subaru hatch or something along those lines, and I told him to drive and I sat in the passenger seat. 
With him driving and me guiding, we slowly pulled into a nearby neighborhood and I looked for a place to park. A few corners down, we saw a playground with apartment buildings on both sides. I had him pull onto the grass, and he shut the car down. With the car silent, we both sat in the seats, a few blocks away from where the chaos initially started and he asked what we should do. I told him that we would just sit here, whatever needed to happen would come to us, not the other way around. I looked around at the rows and rows of windows of the apartments, knowing that dead bodies were still laying in many rooms. In most contexts, a ghostly face would be looking back down at us with a mysterious transparency, an apparition that would never again be seen or tracked down even if we had bolted out of the car, braved the interior of the old complex and zero’d in on the room that we had seen it. But the air was still and calm and there were no ghostly faces. Despite it being in the middle of the day, the interior of the car was mildly comfortable and there was no need to lower the windows. I didn’t feel comfortable with them down anyway. 

I assume that we went to sleep, because I dreamed again, and in this dream I was in a Denny’s or Ihop with my friend who was with me in the car, and Vicky walked in. Vicky was a very cute, petite, and very dead blonde girl who had died in the initial bombings. Even though this was my first time seeing her in my dream, the context was that I had seen her previously in other visions and she had a very snooty way of pissing me off. 

So it was in this dream, with the dead Vicky, me and my friend that I realized that I was dreaming of her. A lucid dream in a dream, if this makes any sense. Vicky was in the middle of trying to tell me something when I stopped her with the impatience of a grade school child and told her bluntly, “Vicky, listen to me. Your dead.”
And it was with that, the figures of logic clipped together. Without realizing it, my mouth continued moving and I said, “So am I.” I turned to my friend who was seated and starting at us with wide eyes, “Your dead too.” I told him. “Were all dead. We died in the bombings.”
Vicky suddenly smiled, a teacher who had finally hammered a difficult concept into a stubborn grade school child. “Vicky,” I asked, “If we are dead, then why are we in this purgatory?” because that’s exactly what we were in. We were in a dead world, devoid of hope and dreams and a future and life. Not in heaven, where I thought I would go when I died. 

“Because,” she said in a matter of fact type of tone, “everybody goes through purgatory. Even good little boys like you.” 

And with that ringing though my head, I awoke from both my dreams into the real world. 

We are already dead.

82,True babysitting experience,1281583118,"TRUE STORY: I was a sophomore in high school when my sister asked me to baby sit her kids, she has 3 boys. That night she was going out with her husband and I just had to stay with the kids and put them to sleep. I laid them in the same room so I wouldn’t have to be checking different rooms. I went to watch TV in one the bedrooms and I could hear noises outside and creaking, even though it was not an old house. Well I began to hear keys then the front door open and the couple talking and shushing as if they did not want to wake the kids. Then the noise moved up to the kitchen, pots and pans moving around and getting cups from the counter, I was sure they were making coffee. Then I left the room where I was watching TV and I said out loud walking down the hall towards the kitchen, “Finally you guys are home; I’ve been freaked out all night, hearing all kinds of rambling.” I stopped as I got to the kitchen when I noticed there was NOBODY in the kitchen, I looked for them, but it was just me and the kids. I ran to the kid’s room and locked the door until they actually got home. That house was scary, my youngest nephew use to have an imaginary friend only while they lived there. He would call him David and talk to him as if he were real.
The house is kinda accurate, its been years.

83,Knock. Knock. Knock.,1281569325,"This was my favorite scary story as a kid so I am going to rewrite it. I hope you guys enjoy.

**EDIT** ilestledisko  was kind enough to re-write my original post so that all of my horrible grammar and spelling was removed.  So please enjoy version 2 and please say what up to the editor because he is the man. (Even though he'll probably have to edit this edit for me)

 It was a clear night in late August as I stared out on the horizon, watching the heat lightning flicker in the distance. As I sit, pondering, scratching my chin, I was startled to look up and see my brother's figure standing before me. ""Hey sis. What are you up to tonight?"" He lifted his greased mechanic uniform up to his brow to wick away the sweat. ""Nothing much, just zoning out. What about you?"" He reached in his pockets to pull out his keys. ""Let me get changed real quick and then we're going to Friendly's and then the drive-in."" He opened the screen door and walked up the stairs.

Oh, how excited I was! My brother and I were very close growing up, but this summer had taken a toll on both of us. In April, our parents set us down to inform us of the divorce that they were finalizing. My brother didn't take it well. He was working twice as many hours at the Jiffy Lube and wouldn't come home 'til very late. He now wore deep circles under his eyes, even after he would sleep all day. But the worst part is, he didn't laugh anymore. So I knew that was what he wanted that night. And that's exactly what I was going to make him do.

He returned ten minutes later wearing his favorite sweatshirt complemented with a smile I hadn't seen in months. I ran to his side as he put his arm around me and escorted me to his 1992 grey Ford Taurus. I hopped into the passenger seat and turned on our favorite classic rock station as he started the engine. It stuttered to a start as Pink Floyd's ""Us and Them"" crooned over the radio. My brother muttered a curse below his breath. We pulled away into what was destined to be a perfect night.

As we pulled out onto Tree Top Lane, I rolled down the window and stuck my hand out into the air as a smile spread on my lips. We whizzed past the trees that scared us in our younger years when we were convinced that monsters and witches inhabited. But we weren't afraid anymore. Those were just stories, and we were strong and brave. We rounded another bend when the Rolling Stones were interrupted by a news bulletin. ""Residents of Somerville, we have received a report that two deranged killers have just escaped from Clearview Mental Hospital. They are very disturbed and have been convicted of the memorable murders of 1999. Use extreme caution. Keep all windows and doors locked and please report any suspicious activities to the police.""

The smile on my face was now just a memory. And the memory of the haunted woods now became a reality in my mind. I looked up at my brother in fear. ""Stop looking at me like that. Listen, we'll be at Friendly's in five minutes. Even the craziest person wouldn't do anything at a Friendly's,"" he said, with a confident smirk and a wink. But I still felt uneasy.

We rounded the last bend right before the creepy old bridge. That's when the car sputtered and jerked, and then finally died. We slowly rolled across the bridge, barely making the other side. ""Son of a bitch! I'm so sick of this piece of shit car, I swear!"" My brother screamed as he reeled back and wailed on the dash with a vicious right. He nearly ripped the door off the hinges as he swung it open. He yanked up the hood and gave a look around before slamming it shut. He got back in the car, wiping his hands off on a bandanna he kept. ""The squirrels chewed through the gas line. My shop's a 5 minute walk from here. I'm just going to run down there and grab an extra line."" I squirmed in fear, sweating now and slightly shaking. ""Oh, come on now. You're my sister. I won't let anything happen to you."" My fears were not quelled at all by this. He knew it. ""Alright, here's the deal. You lay down in the back on the floor. I'll throw this blanket on you just in case. I will run down there and be back in 10 minutes. 15 tops."" ""But, how will I know it's you and not the pyschos?"" I quivered in response. ""I will knock three times, just like this."" He tapped a slow knock, knock, knock on the backseat passenger window. He came back in and turned on the radio and locked the door. He kissed my forehead as he pulled the blanket over me. ""I love you. And believe me, I won't let anything happen to you,"" he whispered before pulling the blanket snugly over my face.

Ten minutes had passed, and I began sweating out of fear and counting the seconds that crawled by. A CCR song softly sang out of the radio, ""Don't go round tonight, it's bound to take your life. There's a bad moon on the rise."" All I wanted was to smash that stupid radio for mocking me. I peaked out from under the blanket to look at the time on the dash. A bright yellow moon stared back at me. It had been 18 minutes now and I was frozen. Just when i couldn't take it anymore, I heard it. Knock. I almost squealed and ripped off the blanket, but I waited. Knock. I began shaking in excitement to hug my brother and finally get that mint chocolate chip shake and laugh about how much of a scaredy cat I am. Smash! I screamed as foreign hands reached towards me, grabbing the blanket. I looked into the most wicked twisted face I had ever seen, even in my nightmares. Then I noticed red and blue lights and saw a police officer yank the hideous figure away from the window and toss him into a waiting cruiser. Another officer opened the door and reached out his hand with a comforting plead, ""It's okay baby, you're safe now. Let's get you home."" I wiped the tears from my face. ""Where is my brother? We have to find him."" He didn't respond to my question and pulled me out of the seat. He put his arm around my shoulders as my brother had at the beginning of the night. ""Now baby, don't turn around. Just follow me straight to the car."" As he finished, a chilled breeze swept through my hair. I turned around to see my brother's lifeless body hanging from the old oak tree. He was swaying in the wind, his worn, white sneakers hitting the side of the car. Knock, knock, knock

84,Dreams as a kid.,1281561034,"Nosleep, I recently remember a couple of dreams I had as a child (3 or 4). First one is more WTF than scary.

It started in my living room with an extended family get-together. When people started arriving my mom and dad left for drinks or something. I was talking with my brother when what I can only describe as the red bull in a suit, top hat, and monocle and an old version of Wilma with white hair from the flintstones walked in. Everyone took kindly to him while me and my brother were like WTF? They introduced themselves and kissed people on the cheek as they did. about an hour into the party (with my mom and dad still out) people started complaining of feeling sick. The bull told me and my brother to come to him, where he grabbed me and Wilma grabbed my brother.They explained that everyone the kissed started to walk like zombies, and say ""I am a sign language"". They kissed us and let us go. We ran into another room while they laughed. I said "" I wish mom and dad were home"", then I woke up.

This one is much shorter but it creeps me out.

My family was staying over at a friends house while our house was on the market. We were sleeping on the floor of the living room when I **thought** I woke up. I see a shadow moving from the kitchen into the room we were sleeping in (I slept so if I stood straight up, the kitchen was on the left around a corner. It looked like a shadow but shaped like a human. It was slightly leaned over,and was looking straight forward. The only reason I knew it was looking forward was a grin. It was ear to ear, literally, had pure white teeth, no lips and red gums. I felt terrified, as though when it got to me I would die.right before it turned toward me it disappeared.

I assume I was going through sleep paralysis, because I couldn't move.

86,Watching me from beyond the door...,1281459969,"A primer: It's just my wife and I, so when we sleep at night we close the BR door slightly, where there's about a foot between the door and frame. The bed is perpendicular to the door and when the door is wide open, you can easily reach it without straining. 

One night, I was sleeping on the bedside closest to the door. I don't know what I was dreaming about, but suddenly I woke up to the sound of the door creaking open or shut. It was 3 in the morning and i awoke with my eyes pointing directly at the bedroom door, and I swear to you that in that split second that I woke, the door was coming to rest... And it was open more fully than how we normally like it. 

I laid there, transfixed on the door, waiting... just waiting for whatever or whomever had moved the door. I KNEW that whatever had pushed on the door was standing in the hallway just beyond the door frame, so I did not move in the slightest. Whatever it was had a vantage point on me, in that it could stand just behind the door and see all the way up to my chest, but still be obscured from view. I had that sensation, an overwhelming one, that I was being watched. 

I must have laid there for 2 hours without moving, barely blinking, before I finally fell back asleep. I have never told my wife about this, as she is easily scared, but I KNOW that something was behind the door that night, but what?",nosleep,blindbug,/r/nosleep/comments/czkn3/watching_me_from_beyond_the_door/

88,My apartment...pops and cracks.,1281454693,"Hey guys, looking for an explanation...I've lived in my apartment for over almost a year and a half and nothing strange has really happened until recently.  I have a TV stand that creaks and cracks but it did so in my last place as well.  I attribute that to me playing xbox and that DVD and HDD spinning so fast, it's not very well made and suffered through a few moves.  But sometimes, it does it in the middle of the night so loudly, it wakes me up.  Whatever, it's done that for years.  Last week though, I woke up after some vivid dreams.  I was immediately frightened and refused to look out the doorway of my bedroom.  All of a sudden, this ridiculously loud CRACK rips through the right side of my room, it was like the wall had split!  I jumped in my bed.  There will be some little cracks and pops in the walls, on different sides but this one was by far the loudest.  Do apartments, walls and stuff creak and groan like that??  It happens at least once a week (but thankfully, not that loudly.  And not at 3 a.m.)   
  I should mention that my apt. overlooks a cemetery, the apt's were built around it (it was an old plantation turned historical site turned apt complex.)  The graves were those of the plantation slaves.  They are quiet neighbors.

90,Dad tells me his story,1281418386,"So I have lived in the same house my entire life. I have never known it to have any paranormal activity. In fact I have enjoyed watching shows like “A Haunting” and thinking how happy I am that my house is free of that. I have never experienced any strange occurrences in my house but this story isn’t about me, it’s about my father.

My dad is a lot like me in regards to the supernatural. We like to think that there is something out there because it makes life more interesting. However, we are very speculative about it all and we go by the motto “I’ll believe it when I see it.” Now my dad sleeps in a different room than my mother. They have done this for the past 15 years. It’s not because they dislike each other, it’s because my father snores very loudly and it is the only way my mother can get any sleep.

Before I tell the story let me give you a basic layout of the house and what it is like at night. My parents’ bedrooms are at the end of my hallway and are adjacent to each other. The master bathroom and office is also in the hallway and those are also across each other in the hallway. I usually go to the office to remove my contacts and use the bathroom before I go to bed. I almost never wake up my parents since their doors are closed and both are pretty heavy sleepers.
 
Now I usually get home around 2 or 3 in the morning after hanging out with friends. I try my best to be quiet so I don’t wake my parents and as long as I don’t knock anything over or do something stupid it is pretty easy. About two weeks ago I came home and was going to bed. I went to the office to take out my contacts when I heard my dad’s voice make like a whine sound. I figured he was having a nightmare which he has one about every 2 months. I believe my dad has night terrors because he tells me about certain dreams that seem very real to him. He had one about this old man cutting him and he said he could feel it. I’m not sure if these qualify as night terrors but my dad is pretty shaken up by them when they happen. 

So when I hear my dad let out the whine I feel bad for him but I don’t really think twice but I figure I will talk to him about it tomorrow. Of course I forgot about it and it doesn’t come up for a few days but one night about a week ago at dinner I remember and bring it up. My father’s face gets very pale and he says he remembers that but doesn’t want to talk about it. I figure he had a bad night terror and decide not to make my dad talk about it anymore. 

Well earlier tonight I am reading some stories on no sleep and I tell my dad a few. He thinks some are scary and asks if there are only stories on here. I say no and bring up this video of some Smith building that’s haunted. In the video there is a creepy ghost girl that can be seen for like a second. My dad and I both get a little creeped out and he gets up and walks away. He has a short attention span so I don’t really think anything of it. 

A few minutes later he says goodnight to my mom and comes to talk to me. He takes me in the kitchen where my mom can’t hear us and he starts to tell me some crazy stuff. He says that for the past month every few nights he has been woken up by the feeling of being watched and sees a woman standing over his bed. He tries to reach for her out of instinct but she disappears. He says it happens so fast that he can’t tell what she looks like but it is definitely a woman. Then he is awake for a few minutes and then falls back to sleep. After he tells me this I give him the “dad you had better not be trying to scare me look” and I can tell he is totally serious. He then says that night I heard him whine he saw her. He then said he didn’t want to tell me because he didn’t want to scare me (which I do get scared easily) but he can’t keep it to himself anymore. Now I am pretty freaked out about my house and wonder when this may happen again. As of now it has happened 3 times and I will update this post if he sees it again. 

Update: 8/29 

My dad saw her again a few days ago. Again he didn't want to mention it until just now. This makes 4 now.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/czd1y/dad_tells_me_his_story/

95,More than money,1281319464,"Well, as we all know, the economy sucks and I am looking for another job to try to fill in my financial gap. I start looking for a waitressing job because it’s fast cash, mostly weekend nights, and I can still work my Mon-Fri job and attend my graduate classes at night school. 
Oh, yes, I should include that whole graduate school thing as it becomes slightly relevant later. At the time, I was attending night school to become a therapist (yes, that is the scary part of the story). My entire program was emphasizing how to be more “open” to people. A skill I soon find out I may be very good at….
Anyways, I get a job at a local winery up in the mountains. I am happy because the average bill there is about $150 and I can tell this is going to be good money. I start my first day up there I think everything is great; I’m working hard, getting along with everyone else, and basically having a good day. At the end of the night the manager asks me to go to the cellar and grab clean linens for the tables. 
I go down there and I get an overwhelming dizzy sensation. The kind you might get when in a crowd of people and everyone is right on top of you, talking loudly and wearing really strong cologne or perfume. I almost fell down the stairs; I figured I was just tired from working the extra hours. When I got down, I couldn’t for the life of me, get the lights to go on. So, feeling like an idiot I go back up and ask how to turn them on. The manager comes back down with me and immediately turns them on. 
As the weeks progress, I notice I dread every time I am sent to the guesthouse and cellar. It is often more of the same: the lights won’t go on, feeling “surrounded”, super “cold” spots, hazes hanging over certain pieces of furniture, and now, the doors have taken to shutting themselves when I walk in. I have learned to combat these little assaults by always taking a flashlight and putting things in the door when I walk in. 
Finally, I get fed up and I ask the builder (who frequents the joint for wine) one night, “Did you ever notice anything here?” He says, “Oh, you mean “them.” I say, “them who.” He says, “you are talking about the people (entities) in the cellar, don’t worry, they are all kind, they are natives, we built on their land.” This kind of bothers me, but at the time it seems reasonable enough and I just leave it at that.
So, I keep working, and things keep happening, and now the door has taken to SLAMMING itself closed when I walk in. I ask one of the other girls, “Does the door slam closed when you go to the guesthouse?” And she says, “Yes, I have to slam the door closed at the guesthouse.” I repeat, “Does the door slam itself closed when you go in the guesthouse?” She responds, “No, I have to slam it closed.” I take her and show her. The door slams closed. Now we are both scared. So, we go tell the chef.
As I recount the tale of the slamming door, the lights, the haze, the dizziness and more he says, “Well, did you know that the rancher who owned this in the 1800s was killed by a bear and his wife hung herself in the cellar.” “WHAT?!?!” If the natives in the cellar weren’t enough, one despairing wife and a dead rancher were making quite a stir. 
So, as part of my graduate program we are required to also go to therapy. I decide to tell my therapist about this because I am now pretty convinced I am a little crazy. I preclude my statement with “I know this is going to sound crazy, but….” And go on to tell her everything. When I am done she looks at me with deep, knowing eyes and says, “I wondered when you were going to tell me about this, I knew you could see, they used to practice witchcraft up there.” 
I QUIT IMMEDIATELY. NO JOB WAS WORTH THAT!

96,Pa Pa Man ,1281302260,"About five years ago my sister buys a house.  It is not especially old. Probably built in the 1970's.  It is a great little two bedroom two bathroom house with a nice backyard.  One night I was hanging out with her and we were watching a movie.  I had to go to the bathroom, which was connected to the guest bedroom.  I had to walk across the guest bedroom to get into the bathroom.  When I walk in, I immediately get a really creepy feeling that I am not alone.  The hairs on my neck stand up and I just feel like something is in there.  I don't tell her about it because I don't want to scare her. Her husband worked nights so she spent a lot of time alone there at night.  I checked the room and nothing was in there anyway.

She lives there for a year and starts telling me stories about things going on in the house.  One time she was home alone and heard the front door slam.  She investigated and it was locked from the inside.  Another time she was showering and her dog started barking at her closed bedroom door as if something was in the hallway.  She grabs her gun and investigates.  Nothing is there.  She tells me how she and her husband were watching TV one night and heard footsteps walking down the hallway.  Other nights they heard heavy breathing.

She talks to her neighbor and the neighbor tells her that the man who lived in the house before her was a doctor and he died of a heart attack in the house.  She said he was a nice man but that he was always a little ornery.  Mostly harmless things though.  My sister has a friend who has a friend that claims to be a medium or psychic or something so she invites her over to ""spiritually cleanse"" the house.  They burn sage and my sister says she felt like she was chasing the entity from room to room until she finally cornered him in a closet.  She tells him that he is scaring her and he has to go.  She keeps hearing a voice in her head saying, ""where can I go? I have no where to go?""  She says that she just told it to move on, go towards the light, or go ""live"" in the backyard because it can't stay in the house anymore.  So nothing happens in the house after they do that.  It is all quiet and normal.

Fast forward a year or two.  Her husband and her buy a new house and decide to rent the old house out because the market is terrible for selling.  A family moves in that has a four year old girl.  

So my sister calls me a few days ago and tells me that she had to go over to the house to fix a broken sprinkler in the backyard.  As she is working on the sprinkler the little girl comes up and pokes her in the side and says, ""You see him too don't you?  You see Pa Pa man.""

My sister says,""what? Who is Pa Pa man? What are you talking about?""  

The little girl says, ""I see Pa Pa man walking around the backyard and he tells me that you see him too.""

Now the mom comes out and she overheard the conversation and is obviously frightened.  She tells the little girl to stop talking like that and then explains to my sister that the little girl makes things up.  She goes on to explain how the little girl used to say that she talked to her dead grandfather.

My sister wants to ask the girl if Pa Pa man is being nice to her or if he is scaring her because she can probably make him go away, but the mom is so frightened she doesn't want to say anything.  I thought this was a really cool when my sister told me.  She also said the little girl had grayish blue eyes that were really intense.

2,Tendrils,1281209533,"I live under that grate: the one in the middle of the nasty tile floor. The one laying prone among the ceramic fixtures and faucets. I live in the fluids you wash down to the floor and into my home. Things that are toxic to you are not to me. Liquid that you discard coats my walls, fills up my floor. You hardly even notice my grate, but it is essential to evacuate the poison from your space into mine.

I watch. I see you at all times. I extend my tendrils with ocular sensors up through the holes. I see you empty your bodily fluids, I see you clean yourself. I watch you rub your skin dry. You never look down, you never notice my silent observation. But there I lie... so quiet, so careful. If you happen to turn around, I slip back into the grate quickly... completely unnoticed.

Sometimes, late at night, I slide my manipulation tendril so gracefully out of the grate. I go along the floor, feeling for the cracks in the tiles, and then slide up the wall. I grasp the light control. You are the only one in here besides me. You are the only one around for miles. You are looking anywhere but the floor. I creep another finger over to you.

3,Any creepy waking dream stories out there?,1281167988,"I've had a few waking dreams, but there is one that will always haunt me. When I was in high school, I had a year where waking dreams became common. Simple things like objects hovering or abnormally large rodents running across the floor were easily laughed off, but this one was different.

I opened my eyes from a fairly regular dream one night to a face in the ceiling above me staring down. It remained there for what felt like forever just watching me. I wanted to scream, but I was too scared. I just kept chanting to myself that it couldn't be real and eventually it just wasn't there anymore. I'll never forget that face.

4,Shadow People,1281163149,"Not sure if this is quite nosleep material, but I'd like to see.

I've always been a huge believer in the fact that children see things that older kids or adults don't.

When I was younger, I saw [shadow people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_people). I never realized what they were or who they were, but I saw them nonetheless. Here are a couple examples of times I saw them that stuck in my mind:

I was six, going on seven, and I was sitting on the couch, minding my own business, thinking of something I had to tell my mommy. Seeing someone shadowy walk into my parents' bedroom, then bathroom, naturally I got up and followed it, calling out for my mommy. Eventually I reached the bathroom and realized no one was there. Confused, I walked out, only to see my mom coming in from outside. I asked if she had been in the bathroom, but she only shook her head.

Fast forward two years. I'm nine, and I just lost a tooth. I excitedly wait for night to come, thinking of what the tooth faerie will bring me. Getting sleepy, I say good night to my parents and start heading upstairs with them. As I reach the foot of the stairs, I stare up them and watch as another shadowy figure walks up them. I run excitedly upstairs, thinking the tooth faerie visited early and I'd find a surprise under my pillow. Sadly, there was nothing, and, once again, I was left confused. When I woke up the next morning, I told my parents about how I saw the tooth faerie, but I'm pretty sure they shrugged it off.

Now, I think that I may have gotten the ages wrong (I was a young girl!) but this definitely happened. It happened *a lot*, in fact. These two just stuck out in my mind as the most odd occurrences, though. I never made contact with them, they never harmed me, I have no idea what they wanted (now and back then), and I have no idea who they were. I also never thought they were weird. Just a normal occurrence. But I've got to wonder if me waiting for someone (first my mother, then the tooth faerie) had anything to do with it.

TL;DR: Go fuck yourself. :)

5,"r/nosleep, what dreams of yours have successfully kept you away from sleep?",1281151311,"You know what I mean: the kinds of dreams that are so macabre that the moment you wake up, you can't imagine closing your eyes again because you know you'll be put into an immense whirl of terror if you do.

I've had very many, but I'm trying to recall some right now. Here's one that I remember from years ago.

I was in this hallway of sorts. It looked to be like one you'd find in a hospital or other medical facility, as there were double doors down the end that I was facing. I remember I was walking towards them, and an unknown force caused me to lift into the air. This part wasn't that freaky, but I was being violently tossed from one side of the hall to the other. Eventually, the setting changed and I was flying uncontrollably around my middle school campus, smacking into things and spouting blood with every collision. The force finally stopped, and I crawled/walked up to the nearest administrator I could find. The look of terror in her eyes were grave...

In the dream, I passed out. And in the dream, I woke up in my bed. Nearly all of my furniture was gone, and a red light was emanating from my ceiling light. I left my bedroom and went down my own hall and towards my mothers' room; I could hear her weeping and mourning. I walked in and she saw me and hugged me, asking how I was feeling. I walked over to the mirror nearby and noticed that my eye was nearly completely hanging from its socket, its stalk looking as if as it had been yanked. The light was completely red around me.

Then I woke up. This was the dream that was on my mind for two weeks. Hard to shake.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/cycw3/rnosleep_what_dreams_of_yours_have_successfully/

7,Hide &amp; Seek,1281109142,"I'll start off by saying that this is a true story - at least, it's as true as I recall it, and I haven't told anyone about it until now, so I know it's not one of those ""tell a lie long enough and you eventually believe it yourself"" things.  This dates back to my early childhood, so I'm willing to accept that it was just my overactive imagination at the time.  I'd prefer that to be the case, in fact.

When I was about 5, my family was living in a fairly normal split-level house.  None of the clichés here: We didn't have a long history of strange noises, spooky visions, shared dreams, or otherwise unexplained phenomena.  The house wasn't really all that old (in fact, it was probably fairly new at the time), nor was it built on an ancient burial ground, cemetery, or ruined church.  The area had no history of supernatural events of any kind.

I was the youngest of three kids, and shared a bedroom with my  brother, who had five years on me.  Sometimes, we would play hide &amp; seek: If I was hiding, he had a tendency to sneak up behind me, suddenly tickle me under the armpits, and shout ""found you!""

He was also fiercely protective of his toys: Being a child of the 80s, toys for ages 6 and up were always *far* more awesome than the kinds of toys which were age appropriate for me - This was back when Transformers were first introduced, and I was just barely under the intended age group.  I couldn't help myself.  Even knowing I'd get in trouble with him, I would frequently play with his toys.

On one such occasion, I was alone in our room, and had hauled out his Ravage &amp; Rumble cassette 'bots, which he had hidden in a drawer of his desk.  I don't recall where my brother was at the time, or what he was doing - all I remember was hearing his voice coming down the hallway towards our room.

I panicked, and being a child of little forethought and planning, did the logical thing: I hid in the closet with the toys still in my hand.  I can hear my brother walk into our bedroom, sit down at his desk, and open and close a few drawers.  At first, I think he's looking for the toys, which I curse myself for not just slipping back into their proper hiding place, but then I hear him turn on his radio (another thing he hid from me in his desk), which he always listened to when he did his homework.

At this point, I'm starting to calm down a little bit.  It hasn't occurred to him that I'm nowhere to be seen, and it's getting close to supper time, at which point I'll be able to make my escape and return the Transformers to their rightful place.  I'm leaning against the closet door with my ear against it, listening to the sounds in the room when it happens.

A hand fell onto my shoulder.  In the thin crack of light from the closet door, I can see that it's an adult hand, wearing a gentleman's glove - the kind of thing you might see a really cheesy stage magician wear.  I stare at it in dumbstruck confusion - it hasn't yet occurred to me to be afraid - when a voice whispers in my ear: ""Found you.""

That's when I totally lose it.  I exploded out of the closet, accidentally tossing my brother's toys across the room as I go.  I tripped over the rug in the middle of our room, and fall, twisting to face the closet as I go down.  My brother notices, of course, and when he sees that I've thrown his Transformers around, starts yelling at me.  I assume he was just upset about the toys, but I didn't hear a word he said.  I was just staring back in the closet.

You can probably guess that there was no one there.  No one in our house even wore gentleman's gloves, let alone *owned* a pair.",nosleep,PSBlake,/r/nosleep/comments/cy5sa/hide_seek/
8,I can barely breathe sometimes.,1281079404,"I've lived in a house in a small town for fifteen of my twenty years, and have always experienced weird things. I have a hard time believing in the supernatural, but certain things cause me to rethink sometimes..


Three or four days out of the week, usually, I have these dreams. They start our normal, just like any other dream usually does, but eventually, after they change around for a while, they get increasingly darker and darker. Instead of my dreams becoming more and more dreamy, they get more and more real. A lot of the time, I wake up into my own subconscious telling me I'm dreaming.. 


This may sound weird, but I hear things before and after I go to bed. I'm the lighest sleeper you'll ever meet, but the only sounds I hear that don't *wake* me are the ones I'm only supposed to hear when I'm *sleeping.* I know I'm not the only one who hears them, but I haven't really been able to prove it past the few friends I've shared the experience with in my house. I remember something about the plot of land I live on being built over/very close to a family that was buried after the wife took the middle spike of a pitchfork and murdered her husband, then her daughter after she called her in to view her father naked with a pitchfork through his head. That's only part of the point though.


I have had a couple of friends of mine from college come over to my house and stay over, and this part of the story seems so unreal to me that sometimes I think they're lying about what they said. Okay so my place has a big living room. We have two big couches, one of which I sleep on usually. We had a mattress on the floor for Ben, Katie and I were on the couches. I was laying there staring at the nearly pitch black ceiling when all of a sudden I hear this giant **THUD** come from directly above me. Then Katie, who was laying on the couch to my right screamed really loud and short. Ben comes out of the kitchen and shines his phone around and says something like ""What the fuck Katie? Chase is sleeping!!"" and immediately I was like, ""No I wasn't, I just heard this really loud noise upstairs and I freaked the fuck out. I can't sleep dude.""

Ben is immediately like ""Bullshit, you've been snoring your ass off for like twenty minutes!"" and all of a sudden my mind goes back to every time I'd heard the same noise from upstairs and gotten so scared I didn't know whether to wake up or fall asleep. He then continued ""and I was in the kitchen. I didn't hear shit man, you're crazy."" 

I thought they were fucking with me, and then Katie started crying and said ""Guys seriously stop fucking with me. Who was just upstairs?"" She sounded so desperate, and I'd never really heard her cry in fear before. Gave me chills I can't even describe.


We talked about it for a bit, and ended up moving the couches to where they faced the mattress in the middle and all got on the mattress so the couches could make a wall to help fend off whatever it was. Ben still had some doubts, because Katie and I woke up at the exact same time and all that shit, but regardless. We kept talking for as long as I can remember, until voices slowly filled less of the air than silence did, and I fell asleep again. I woke up the next morning, cooked breakfast, and we drove back to Denton. Didn't want to say anything about it, but they looked like nothing had happened. We were all talkative and happy for the rest of the day. 


End of story one. 

To elaborate on aforementioned noises I'd heard prior to the event described above, I generally have a hard time sleeping. I tend to find myself waking up at random points of the night, and I even wake up again after I've already woken up.. 

Every once in a while, I don't just hear the sounds when I'm sleeping. A lot of times, I will be laying there staring into nothingness like usual, and the same **thud** I hear will *immediately* put me into a deep dream state I can't escape. I know I'm dreaming, but I instantly start having these vivid images of hallways that turn from a deep deep purple to black, and figures running back and forth between rooms. Indescribable figures, for that matter. Other times, the **thud** puts me on a gurney, and my dead eyes stare into the open and closed doors I pass, showing me horrors no conscious man can describe. The best part is that I know I'm dreaming, so I know it's not real. It's also the worst part because no matter how long I stare into those empty black holes of eyes that the disfigured bodies possess, I can never stop them from coming. After all, I'm dead, and on a gurney. I don't hear voices, though, only very faint wind blowing far far behind me. It's as if a tree is rustling in the distance, but I never see it.  


Then I just wake up. The last thing I remember seeing most of the time is kinda like a hand, but it's just holding it's palm up, fingers together, like a beggar asking for change or some shit. I've become accustomed to this over the past four or five years, and I know I'm as sane as they come. Maybe I just have weird dreams. 

I hear things every night I forget about them. Almost like they *want* me to fear, or know they're there. The fear thing is lacking a bit now, because I know they can't kill me (if they even exist). I just don't know if I can tell anyone, due to the fact that I'd probably be marked as psychotic or delusional. 

My ears just stared ringing at the end of that paragraph, so I think I'll stop writing now.

10,Grafton Pond,1281061708,"This happened when I was sixteen. No one ever brings it up, and I needed somewhere to tell this story. I figured nosleep would appreciate it. 

Years ago, my friends and I wanted to go fishing in the small town of Grafton, NH, since my family owns a place near there. We wanted someplace where we could really just shoot the shit in peace, regardless of how many fish we could or couldn't catch. The place was [Grafton Pond](http://imgur.com/nI7df ""Grafton Pond""). The red dot is where we were on shore, the green dot is where my friends took a canoe out. 

There were four of us and one canoe. The plan was to have two stay on the shore while two take the canoe out to fish in the middle. By the time we arrived it was six p.m. and Carl and I had decided to stay on the shore. This left Ben and Chris to take the canoe. 
	
Ben and Chris were a good distance out by the time seven thirty came around. A little too far, maybe, but I didn't want to say anything to Carl about it, since Carl really wouldn't have cared. When it was eight, Carl and I set up a little campfire about thirty feet up on shore so that when the others came back, we could make some s'mores and enjoy the peaceful place around us. I carried up buckets of water to extinguish the fire when it got time to leave.
	
Fog had started to roll in on the water, however. One of my biggest fears has always been being stranded on the water, so when I could barely see the canoe through the fog, I felt a sense of panic. 

I wasn't alone—Carl's face was knotted with fear, too. It wasn't that the others were terribly far away, we just didn't want them paddling around with no sense of direction. I called out to them, and heard them call back. 
	
I told them to head back over here, but only if they could see us, and if the fog got too thick, just wait out there until it lifted. I really did think it was going to lift—it had come out of nowhere and so I thought it was some sort of freak weather thing. After about fifteen more minutes, though, the fog was thicker than ever. It was literally like staring at a giant, undulating white wall. There was no way they could see us through all that fog. I called out to them, but got no response.
	
No big deal, they just didn't hear me. I called out again. No response. The third time I tried, I heard a small sound, as if they were yelling from much, much farther away. This worried me so I yelled for them to stay put.
	
The fire was raging now; we wanted to have it as bright as possible in the fashion of a makeshift lighthouse. I had seen no movement yet, and the fog showed no signs of letting up. In fact, it was growing thicker even though that seemed impossible. It was creeping around the shore, too. It was surrounding us—the fog wrapped around the area in a giant circle, leaving us in a hollow. Feeling a sort of terror make its way through me, I threw whatever branches I could onto the fire. But the taller the flames got, the thicker and closer the fog was around us. 
	
This is when I started hearing things. They weren't definite sounds, but small noises that I couldn't really put my finger on. It was as if something was going on all around us, just out of sight in that fog. It sounded like footsteps, sometimes running, but it disappeared quickly and seemed to be coming from all directions at once. I suddenly felt woozy, as if I were losing my sense of balance in all of this nothingness. I tried to stand up, but fell back down again. So I shouted for Ben and Chris, pausing between cries to wait for a response.
	
I never got any. At this point, I was frantic. I wanted to run to the shore, maybe my voice would carry more if I were closer to the water. Feeling more like I was under the control of someone else, I ran into the fog. 
	
Everything disappeared as I got into the fog. I couldn't hear Carl, and I couldn't hear the fire. Realizing what I had done, I turned around to go back, only to find that I no longer knew which way was back. I called for Carl, and at first there was nothing. Then, he reached out and grabbed me, pulling me back into the clearing.
	
Around 8:30 we heard the sounds again, this time louder. It sounded like a stampede, and it was coming directly toward us. Before I could even register what was going on, Ben and Chris fell into the hollow, breaking down into tears as they did. 
	
It was ten minutes later when they had finally stopped crying and could find words again. This is what they told us:
	
At first when the fog started to come in around us, I shouted over to you and asked if we should come back to shore.You just stood there and shook your head. (Right away I interrupted him, saying that I don't recall that at all, but he ignored my comment.) Chris and I shrugged and tried to continue fishing. It must have taken only thirty seconds for more fog to surround us, making us blind in all directions. I felt uneasy, like all of my senses were being cut off. 
	
There were sounds, like things moving all around us. Splashes, frantic thrashing in the water, gargling noises, God knows what else. We pulled our lines out of the water and just sat there, unable to do a thing as we both shivered violently with terror. I have no idea how much time passed—sometimes it only felt like a few minutes, sometimes it felt like a whole day had gone by. 
	
When something rocked the boat roughly, Chris and I practically threw our oars in the water as we paddled as fast as we could. I guess we got lucky and found the right shore, though. I was worried we'd end up on one of those islands. 
	
We all agreed that, yes, they had been very lucky. I then began to tell them about the sounds we'd been hearing on shore, when the sounds actually started up again. They were running, jumping, cracking, desperate sounds. I pictured hundreds of people all running around blindly, searchingfor  some way out of the fog. I looked at the fire.
	
The fire's height was at the point where it was dangerously close to the tree branches above, so I grabbed for the buckets of water sitting next to the fire. I told the others I didn't want the whole damn forest to catch, and so I put it out. That wasn't the reason I did it though, was it? No I don't think it was. It was the image in my mind of all of those people, stumbling around frantically before seeing the light from the fire and running toward us. I was afraid they'd get us. I know, it's childish, but I've always been afraid of the unseen, afraid of things beyond our perception. 
	
After the fire was out, we all sat in the darkness, huddled close together. Eventually the fog lifted a little, and as soon as we could, we bolted for the car. We didn't really sleep that night, and we didn't really talk either. Like I said, none of us has brought it up with one another since.

Now, I have night terrors when I get to hot. This pretty much consist of me being fully awake but still in a dream state and I sleep walk trying to escape whatever it is I am dreaming. It isn't fun, so the swamp cooler is a must.


I'm asleep but awoken by my SO getting into the bed. Whatever, I face the wall and try to go back to sleep. Drifting in and out of sleep I am having issues hitting the sweet spot in sleepytime land. I suspect the swamp cooler is off, because I notice I am getting hot. When I get up to check the swamp cooler I notice that the door that leads from our room to outside to the patio is open. 


I'm a bit pissed now because I always tell my SO to lock the door (I always have to do this, but last night I went to bed first). So I grab my pillow, shut the door and go toss and turn on the couch for awhile. 


The next evening after we have made amends, I decide to play around with my SO. Maybe with a scary story that door will start getting locked.

""yeah.""

""you know why.""

""because you were mad at me.""

""no, I woke up after you came to bed and the door was open""

""again?""

""what do you mean again?""

""like 15 minutes before you left I noticed it was open and shut it.""

19,Has anyone ever tried to find a witch's grave?,1280813177,"I remember when I was about 14 or 15 years old. A group of us, all bored teenagers, heard about a witch that was buried at a modern cemetery about an hour away from where we lived. So the 4 of us headed out there one weekend at nighttime.

Besides our flashlights and a small light at the keeper's shack, the place was pitch black. We couldn't see the car we came in from 20 yards away. But none of us were creeped out by the place or what we were doing, so we kept searching for this grave. About 30 minutes in, we see a couple of black cats sitting atop the gravestones. Creepy, but not a big deal. Soon after that, I found one grave that evidently had a large brass sphere on top of it, but it had fallen and left a hefty crater in the grass right above where the corpse would be buried. Again, strange, but nothing in the graveyard looked that well kept anyway. Then we found four freshly dug graves all next to each other, but of course, we're at a cemetery, so who would be surprised. After probably an hour of searching, we stumble upon a single unmarked, worn, old gravestone. It was misshapen and discolored, and it was obviously much older than anything else in the entire place. Getting tired, we decided that it was only logical that we found the witch's grave and began walking back to the car.

It was when I got about 10 feet from the car that I felt something very strange. I heard a heavy breathing, but not a person's. I look over to my left and see what looks like a silhouette of a horse, face not half a foot from mine. I could be imagining this, but I think I felt it's breath on my face. There definitely was no horse near the entrance when we arrived, so I had a small panic attack. Seeing as how the car was so close, I sprinted to it and yelled for our driver (who made it back to the car before I did) to turn the lights on. When he did, there was nothing there but a short wire-and-wood fence. Completely baffled, I tried to shrug it off during the car ride home.

I got a monster in my closet

Someone's underneath my bed

The wind's knocking at my window

I'd kill it but it's already dead


It waits till the midnight hour to come

To torture me for the wrong I've done

It just sits there and stares at me

And it won't let me get any sleep


I got a monster in my closet

Someone's underneath my bed

The wind's knocking at my window

I'd kill it but it's already dead



At first I was scared when I looked at his eyes

But now that I know him I'm not that surprised

I'm just waiting on the sun to rise

Oh, how I wish that old sun would rise



I got a monster in my closet

Someone's underneath my bed

The wind's knocking at my window

I'd kill it but it's already dead



I used to wonder why he looked familiar

Then I realized it was a mirror

And now it is plain to see

The whole time the monster was me



Oh, there's a monster in my closet

Someone's underneath my bed

The wind's knocking at my window

I'd kill it but it's already dead



The living dead

Only thing that could bring it back alive, woman

Is some good, good head

I've been living in my current house for 18 years, although I'm moving soon, and I've always been a bit sensitive to how a house ""feels"". For instance, I used to go to my neighbor's, who's also my aunt, house often, but never felt quite right there. The air was always thick and there was this imminent feeling that I was being watched (Not to mention the numerous rooms that can hide zombies, but that's just me). I learned recently that at least one person has died there. The same goes for another neighbor of mine, who's sister died in her sleep one night while my neighbor was in her front room (they had different sleep schedules). She didn't realize she was dead until the next morning. I always feel odd in those houses for some reason, like someone is always right behind me or is watching me from one of the rooms. 

So here's where it comes into play. I've always felt at home where I live, never scared, just always happy and safe. A few years ago, my mother began hearing things in the attic. Scurrying sounds, like a rat or a raccoon would make, like soft running. We'd set traps, check the attic, wait a few weeks, nothing. The scurrying continued, and my father and I just brushed it off as my mother being delusional. This carried on for about 2 years until my mom and I switched rooms. I heard it once or twice, but after a while, it stopped. Still feeling safe, still happy. 

When I was 15, I was home alone early in the morning when I was awaken by a thump. A single loud thump that seemed to originate in my hallway. I acted asleep, trying to play it off as nothing, seeing as I was alone. But the thumps got louder, increasing in frequency, like someone was running up and down the hallway. And whatever it was, it was angry. After several minutes, the thuds stopped, and I forced myself back to sleep. This was the first time I experienced that unnerving feeling in my own house.

Which leads us to the last few weeks. The feeling's come back. I'm constantly checking my rooms because I feel that something's there. I hear creaks and dishes falling like there's someone rummaging through my kitchen when I'm alone in my living room. Last night, I tried to go to bed after reading a few mild r/nosleep s. I was a little bit scared, but  nothing major. I turned off my lights and my television, as usual, with a shred of light from the streetlight outside casted in. The silence made my ears ring and immediately I felt like I was being watched. My closet doors are non existent and therefore always open, but the darkness within them seemed darker than usual. I closed my eyes and that's when the whispers began. It sounded like a group of people, whispering quietly in some incomprehensible language, kind of like tongues. I looked around the dark room again, but saw nothing except the darker than dark closet, noticing the whispering had stopped. When I laid back down, it began again, and a shadow darted in my peripheral vision. I scrunched my eyes closed, but something was keeping me awake despite my best efforts. It's weird, but I feel the darkness of my closet *smiling* at me. Out the corner of my eye, I saw a four foot, human shaped shadow at the corner of my bed, but when I turned to look at it face on, it scurried through my dresser like it was nothing. 

Now, I'm not a religious person, but I said my prayers after than, and the feeling that I usually got faded away for the most part. But I think whatever was in my attic found its way out. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/cw8gk/so_im_not_sure_if_this_is_extremely_creepy_but_it/
29,Something very creepy happened to me. Should I call the police?,1280701754,"I moved from a shoddy apartment to my first house two weeks ago.  The only problem is, my only friend in the area (yep, I’m shy) could not help me carry my furniture and boxes because she suffers from severe dystonia.  Here’s where I made my first mistake: I looked for a moving service in the local paper, and found an ad for really cheap movers.  These guys offered to load and unload all my stuff for only eighty bucks.  They’d provide a complimentary moving van, too.  Ever heard of too good to be true?  Well, apparently that platitude slipped my mind.

Anyway, moving day went smoothly.  My friend and I supervised.  The movers were two thirty-something men – they might have been brothers.  Each had brown hair and dark eyes.  They were really quiet, and I can’t think of a single physical feature that would distinguish them from other strangers.  To be perfectly honest, I doubt that I could pick either from a lineup.   

Things got creepy that night, after everyone left.  I was alone in my living room, where all the cardboard boxes had been stacked.  I was too tired to find my bedsheets, so I slept on the couch.  Around three AM, I woke up, because one of my boxes (it had been balanced on another box) had fallen over.  I merely stared at it, too frightened to move.  Nothing else happened, so I convinced myself that gravity and poor stacking had tipped the box over and fell back to sleep.

The next morning, as I sorted through my junk, I noticed a large, unmarked box hidden among my other boxes.  It was really huge, large enough to store a washing machine.  Also, it wasn’t taped shut (I’d practically cocooned the other boxes in packing tape).  Practically shaking with fear, I peered inside, and was initially relieved because the box was completely empty, except for a white handkerchief.  The rag smelled strange, like armpits and mint bubblegum.  Call me paranoid, but after the initial relief wore off, I started to worry that somebody had been hiding inside the box.  When I called the movers, they did not answer the phone, and I have not been able to contact them since then.

Sorry about the long story.  Here’s my question: what now?  I’m sure that nobody is currently in my house.  It’s small (one bedroom, kitchen, living room, bathroom, and cramped attic), and all my valuables are intact.  But it seems unusual that somebody would organize a fake moving service and put a weird box in my house for no reason.  Should I worry about hidden video cameras?  Will somebody try to break in later?  Should I call the police?  I’m at a loss.  As a side note, last night I found a piece of old mint bubblegum stuck to my bedpost.  Guess it’s a good thing I slept in the living room that first night.

EDIT: I am sorry to report that, since moving into her new house, trichodesmium has disappeared... Who am I, you may ask? Perhaps I am trichodesmium's ghost. 

But in all honesty, I am flattered that this post generated so much interest. People are still responding to it!

40,The Man in the Hat,1280515809,"I've told this story on Reddit before, but I figured I'd repost it here since I've had so much fun on nosleep. I've known my close-friend ""Bill"" for a little more than a decade now. I met his brother ""Steve"" a few years after meeting Bill.

Bill went to school at Virginia Tech. I used to go down there every Halloween while he was there. It was always a grand time and Blacksburg used to be a great little college town. That's not to say that it isn't still, but I haven't been down there in a long time. One year, for Halloween, we went to an Aggie party. There was a surprisingly decent Tool cover band, a giant bonfire, and plenty of alcohol and women. But I digress.

The party begins to break up early in the morning. Bill was a friend of the guy hosting so after the band had packed up and almost everybody had left we all huddled around the remains of the bonfire. . .well, at this point it was less a bonfire and more a typical campfire. There were five or six of us. Myself, Bill, Steve, Hillary, Dave (host), and Stephanie. We were having a good time, finishing up the booze and talking.

It got to be late(r), and around 430 in the morning Bill looks over at Steve and asks if he has to be at work soon. ""Nope."" Steve replies. ""I took a hiatus.""

""Oh. I understand."" Bill replies. An awkward silence passes through like a quiet, chilly breeze. ""Hey, Steve. Do you think you could tell everybody else about what happened?"" All eyes turned to Steve. Despite the warm, reddish glow of the fire we could all see Steve's face turn white.

""No. No I don't think so."" Steve said. His voice quavered a bit.
""C'mon man. It'll be good to talk about it."" His brother egged on. ""Plus, it's a good night for a spooky story."" At the mention of a good nail-biter the rest of us immediately began to jibe Steve. Finally, after a minute or two he conceded. This is his tale, in his own words.

""I work at a factory on the other side of the mountain. I live on this side. The factory is pretty much the only thing that is on the other side of the mountain. In order to get to work every morning, I have to take a road that goes up one side of the mountain and down the next. I typically leave at 430 in the morning in order to get there by 5. There is one intersection on this road. The road cuts through a small town and there is one light at this intersection.

I wake up late one day. It was about 450. I jump out of bed, throw on some clothes and get into my truck. I tear ass up the mountain. The sun isn't up yet. You know, the time of year and all, the sun isn't up until later. I get to the little town at the top of the mountain and the light at the intersection is red. There are two buildings at the intersection. As I'm sitting at it, to the right, is a general store. Diagonal from where I am is the post office. This is the only road that cuts through the top of the mountain. There is one light aside from the traffic light and it's on the side of the store. Out of the corner of my eye I notice something just out of the reach of the light and mostly hidden in shadows. I turn to look and I see a man leaning against the store. He was wearing a wide-brimmed hat. I don't remember what else he was dressed in but the minute I lay my eyes on him he pushes away from the wall and begins walking over toward my car.

I turn back to the light and realize that it's taking a bit too long to turn to green. I turn back to look at the store and the man is standing next to the passenger side of my truck. He keeps his head down somewhat. I don't remember much of what he looked like - just the hat. He raps on the window, and I oblige by unrolling it just enough so that the air creeps in.

""Excuse me, sir."" He says. His voice was flat, calm and somehow sweet. ""I could really use a lift to the other side of the mountain.""

I thought about it for a second before realizing that I was already late for work and just a little creeped out. ""No, I'm terribly sorry but I'm late for work at the plant and really just need to get there are soon as possible.""

The man grew a little terse. ""I really need to get off this mountain. I really need a ride. Do you think you could let me in to your car?""

""I'm sorry - no. I'm already running late as it is."" I looked away, toward the traffic light - still red. I didn't have time to see his fingers creep into the open window but I heard him pull on the window. Rather, I heard the window groan a bit and he started yelling.

""LET ME IN. LET ME IN TO YOUR CAR!""

He kept pulling on the window so hard that I thought he was going to break it. I didn't care if the light was red - I floored it. I blew through the intersection and, in the rear view mirror could see the man, standing in the middle of the road, fade into the distance. And I swear that I heard him shout, '*don't you know who I am*'.

I'm tearing down the mountain. I'm panting. I'm really freaked out. After I get a few miles away the road gets really windy - lots of curves and turns. I realize that I'm just going way too fast and I'm entirely too freaked out to keep driving like this. So when I get to the next straight bit of road I slow down and come to a stop off to the side of the road. I close my eyes, take a deep breath and open them again. I turn to look out the window.

And the man was standing right next to my side of the car.

I blacked out.

The next thing I remember was waking up in my car, in the parking lot of the factory. I was curled up in a ball beneath the steering wheel. The pedals were jabbing me in my back. The driver-side window had been unrolled just a bit. Enough to get your fingers into.""

All of us were as quiet as corpses. Steve shuddered beneath the weight of his own tale. His face was still white despite the fire. None of us talked about it for the rest of the night. None of us slept either, at least, not until the sun came up and we were cozy in our own beds.

For years now, Steve hasn't had a problem reciting the story. He doesn't work at the factory anymore - he's a sous chef on the West Coast. He still turns a little white when reciting the story. Recently though, upon learning that his wife was pregnant, he has stopped telling the story. Not sure why but he must think it's important for some reason.",nosleep,jonuggs,/r/nosleep/comments/cvlf6/the_man_in_the_hat/

42,Just a few minorly creepy things from a coffee house,1280501627,"This story isn’t as impressive as a lot of the ones on here, but I swear it’s true. They're all things that happened when I worked the night shift at a local coffee house in high school. Alone, the experiences might not be much, but they still creep me out, because I could never really find a convincing reason as to why these particular ones happened. These all happened the last year I was there.

This coffee house was in an old brick building in a small town that pretty much died by 8 pm. I worked there Monday-Friday from 6-11, so it wasn’t unusual that I didn’t see a single soul from 8-close—and that includes on the street out front. It was a ghost town at that time. 
One night, I was sitting at a table folding Java Jackets, spacing out when I heard a crash in the kitchen. Confused, I get up and walk in there to see what’s going on. There is a really wide shelf over the sink where all the heavy pots and pans are stored. Being the only one working there at night, I’m positive that I had pushed all of them to the very back of the shelf so there was at least a two inch gap between the end of the shelf and the pots (I frequently put my drinks on the gap).  There were about 8 pots and pans laying in the middle of the kitchen floor. Not in the sink where they should have landed if they had tipped off the shelf. In the middle of the floor. It was slightly disconcerting and I tried to recreate it by putting them hanging slightly off the shelf and shaking it, but they still wouldn’t fall.

I didn’t think too much of it at the time until a couple of weeks later when I was mopping the floors. There is an old espresso grinder we had (not the automatic kind) that had a very heavy switch. Up was ON, down was OFF. It took a good amount of force to flick this switch and I maybe used it once a night. I had probably run the grinder a couple hours earlier. I’m on the other side of the building mopping, when all of a sudden I hear that loud grinder turn on. I look over there and just see it going to town. The mop falls from my hands and I get the creepy feeling that someone else is in the building. I cautiously walk over and turn it off. I call out, check the kitchen, the bathroom, the back patio. No one is there. I stand outside to have a smoke and try to get my hands to stop shaking. When I went back in, I tried to maneuver the switch in such a way that it’s stuck in the middle (maybe it just flipped on that way). That old switch was so heavy that, even after trying for 15 minutes, I could not get it to stay in a neutral position. It was either firmly on or firmly off.

The last thing I saw is the one that really defies explanation for me. It was a couple of weeks later and I had just finished mopping. I take the mop bucket out the back door and dump it, turn around, walk in the back door and just freeze. There on the freshly mopped floor are white, child-sized, bare footprints. They lead from the back door (which I had been standing in front of—no one came in) to the register. And that’s it. No prints leading away, they ended at the register. I run out front and scan the street, but there is no one to be seen. I chill out there for awhile, get some fresh air and walk back in to examine the footprints. Wiping a finger across gets rid of them, but there was no powdery substance or anything to explain the color. I could’ve sworn though, that there was an extra dollar bill in my nearly empty tip cup, though, so at least it tipped. Maybe he/she felt bad for me.

Anyways, haven’t told many people about this. Just figured I’d share and that a couple of you might be interested.",nosleep,TrainDefecator,/r/nosleep/comments/cvi88/just_a_few_minorly_creepy_things_from_a_coffee/

44,"My one and only ""story""...",1280468364,"Let me first start off by stating I have never really been a big believer in ghost or the supernatural, but I do have one experience that I wanted to share...

I am sorta part of a small band, I do the Lights and Video for them.  We had two gigs in two small town in North Texas a few months ago.  The first one started Saturday about 8ish and by the time we were packed up and ready to the hit the road it was close to 11.  The second show was in a town about an hour and half away, so we called ahead and told them we were going to just grab a hotel and would be out in the morning.  The second gig contact person just happened to be a nun and insisted we head out that way so we did not have to pay for a hotel room.  So after we grabbed some dinner we hit the road, it  was close to midnight by the time we left town.

When we get there and its pushing 2 AM and we are all exhausted from the day, the building we were staying in was some sort of hall that used to be a seminary or something so there were small rooms the lined the walls of the building.  We each grabbed a room at started to get ready to hit the sac.  Since I was the driver and the low man on the totem pole, I always let them grab the showers first when we travel.  

By the time everyone was done and I was heading to the showers it was getting close to 3, and I was exhausted!  Where the rooms that we were staying in were all down one hallway, and to get to the restrooms I had to come out of the hallway into a large open room, make a right and walk down a ways before I got there.  To the left as you came out of the hallway there was a large wall of windows that opened out into the ""courtyard"" that had some large trees and benches scattered around...

As I was heading out of the hallway, everything was dark in the large room, the only light was coming in from the large wall of windows.  Just as I was about to take the right towards the bathroom something caught my attention outside, and I look in that direction and I see what I think is a guy sitting out on the bench.  It was a quick glance and I had already turned away before my brain realized what I had seen... and I quickly looked back and there was nothing there.   I was a bit nervous because it was just about 3am and there should not have been anyone sitting out there, but I just chalked it up the shadows/trees/being dark and did not really think much of it...

After my shower and all my nightly duties I head back down to my room, not really giving much though to what I had seen because of my lack of sleep.

The guy I was sharing a room with (there were two beds in each room) was already fast asleep, so I did not want to turn on the light.  There was enough light coming from the hallway that I did not need it.  It was just the ambient light coming from outside (the wall of windows).  So I finish up my stuff, crawl under the sheets, put my head on my pillow and just as I am about to close my eyes, something moves by the door.  

The only reason I know something moved by the door, because for that split second that it did, the room got pitch black...

This time I knew something/one was there and had just walked by the door.  I did not make a sound, I did not move, I just closed my eyes, again I chalked it up to being so tired...

The next day comes and we have the whole day to just relax and hang (our show was not till that evening).  At breakfast I am sitting with our sound guy and the drummer and tell them what I had seen the night before, they both laugh and make fun of me and that was that...

The show went off without a hitch, and we start tearing down and packing up for the long (10 hours) ride home...

The one of the backup vocals comes up to me in a panic asking me what I saw the night before, and I tell her ""nothing, why?"" and she begins to tell me that our Drummer and Sound guy have been giving her a hard time about the place being haunted, I did not know this at the time, but she is a big time believer!  So she finally gets it out of me, I tell her my story of what I saw on the bench and what I saw walking down the hallway, or lack there of and starts to freak out and says she is going to wait in the van for us to finish.

I give her a hard time about not at least saying bye to the people that invited us out to play, and she finally went into to say bye and I continued packing up the stuff.

Within minutes she comes running even more panicked then before.  I ask her what is going on... and she tells me the following the story.

Since it was so late in the evening, the nun was waiting up for us.  She said about 12:30 or 1:00 (about the time we were leaving the other town) she heard a knock, and it was not like a normal knock, it was loud enough to shake the windows). She said that she knew it could not be us, but went to see who it was.  It took her about 5/10 seconds to walk over to the door that is on the wall of windows and no one was there.

I guess during their goodbyes my story was brought up and she was told that on many occasions there have sightings of shadowy figures and people sittings on the bench only to be gone at next glance...

45,It all came together in the morning.,1280435603,"Hi nosleep.  I just discovered you today and would like to try my hand at my scary story.  This happened during a night in December 2009.

My wife and I rent a house along a very busy street in Seattle.  There are several bus routes that go right by our house and a lot of vehicle and foot traffic.  In short, it is pretty loud, even at night.   

Given the amount of foot traffic, and being right in the middle of the city, our place was built with security in mind.  When we moved in 3 years ago, the landlord proudly showed us all of the measures: steel doors and frames, heavy deadbolts, and all windows accessible from the ground have bars.  There are even cameras at the front and rear entrances, and the door knobs are enclosed in a ring of metal to prevent someone from wrenching them and destroying the mechanism.  I thought this was kind of strange, as the neighborhood is quite nice now.  But, it was apparently not always that way, and the house was built in the '70s, before much of Seattle's core had been gentrified.  In any case, the measures gave my wife peace of mind, and they were done quite subtly, so it's not like it looked like we lived in Skyway or something.  Skyway is Seattle's Compton/Oakland, if you were unaware.

Now, for three years we have felt perfectly secure.  Further, I have never been a fearful person, perhaps almost to the point of naivete.  When I was young, I was the kid who would get scared when the basement was making noises, then force myself to investigate and find out it was the water heater, or something.  I even had my own methods, like when going into a dark room I would stare straight ahead of me, not looking around, but letting my peripheral vision pick up any movement around me, so that I would not be attacked from the side I was going to look at second.  Maybe I was a weird kid.  But, I digress.  Back to the house.

The house is built into a hill, so that the second floor is theoretically reachable from the ground on one side.  Both bedrooms are on the second floor, and both are on the side that is built into the hill.  There is another house up the hill from us that is only 20 feet away, and has a deck that comes within 10 feet of our place.  For the past three years there have been numerous noises outside the bedroom windows on this side, and it has always been something innocuous.  We've had a cat stalking underneath our window, a family of raccoons foraging in the leaves, or the neighbors smoking on their deck.  It's always something harmless, so we've become pretty accustomed.

Now, this particular night, I did not sleep well.  I normally sleep pretty heavily, but there was something weird to me, and I kept waking up every half hour or so, between 12 and 2 AM.  I heard rustling outside our window several times.  I thought at one point that I even heard whispers.  I chalked it up to animals, neighbors or ambient noise and went back to sleep each time.  I remember very strongly the urge to simply not get out of bed.  I mean, I was tired and it was the middle of the night.  

Around 2 AM, I heard something louder than normal, and woke, but was extremely groggy.  I made zero connection between what the sound was and what it could mean, if that makes any sense.  It just was, and I filed it away, but was not prepared to take any action on it.  

All the same, I had to piss.  I am a larger guy, 6' 1"", about 240.  This is only relevant because when I get out of bed and walk around, I'm kind of loud.  My steps make noise.  The bed is against the wall (and window) and I'm on the window side, so I have to step over my wife and hit the floor with some force.  I think this is probably what saved us.  

You see, the bedroom windows that have bars on them are frosted, so you can't really see out of them.  They're also only about a foot and a half tall and three feet wide.  There are two in each bedroom.  I really had no idea what was going on outside, about 6 feet away from our bed.  The 'bars' on the windows are not attached to the house, but to the window frames.  They only prevent one from breaking the glass and getting in.  But if you remove the whole window...

The windows are hinged at the top with the hinges on the outside of the house.  There is a latch at the bottom of the window, so that the window swings outward, and to lock it, is pulled toward the house and the latch is rotated.

That sound that was louder than normal?  That I filed away but didn't do anything with?  That was the latch itself being unscrewed from the outside and falling onto our floor and rolling around in the other bedroom.  Apparently the head of the screw that holds it in place is on the outside of the house.  

I didn't put any of this together until we woke up the next morning and saw that burglars had removed the entire window in the other bedroom.  They were about to come in until I got up and started stomping around, assuming I'd heard the latch and realized someone was breaking in.  But I had no idea.  I just had to take a piss.

47,The night I saw The Ring,1280363006,"I wanted to post this because I've been enjoying this subreddit a lot since I discovered it today. This is an old story from the night I saw The Ring. It's not super exciting but it freaked me out.

So I was leaving my girlfriends house after watching the film. She lived in a small sub-division so my bid ol' truck had a hard time getting out. As I was trying to turn around in the driveway/road some dude knocked on my window (it's 2AM) and freaked the shit out of me... and then helped me back up... and then he like walked off really slow. It freaked me out.

Then I was about to turn onto my street. Keep in mind I live out in the country. There is one street light on the corner. I think my lights must have fooled it into thinking it was day or something. My face CLOSE to the window to see if any cars were coming.. and the light goes out and all around my truck goes out. It freaked me out, again.

I finally get home. Now to get to my room I have to walk by a very big living room with a VERY high ceiling. I was walking by and the small night-light in the bathroom behind me was on. I could see my own reflection in the large currently off TV that we have. The shape of my body and the shadows gave me the willies. It freaked me out again. 

I wake up fine, slept without nightmare, and went downstairs. I look into the living room, standing in the same spot I had last night. My dad had been replacing the lightbulb on the high ceiling... the night before I had been staring right under a large red ladder... like the one from the tape that kills you.

Needless to say I refuse to watch it now. Horses freak me out anyway.",nosleep,EnvyEye,/r/nosleep/comments/cuv4z/the_night_i_saw_the_ring/
48,One of my mums scary experiences...,1280362072,"This is my first post to Nosleep folks. It's a true story that my mother swears blind happened to her. She's what you'd call vaguely psychic. I remember a few tales from the past that she would relate. This one apparently involved me. 

When i was about two or three we lived in a tenement flat in Parkhead, Glasgow, Scotland. We stayed next door to my Granny who occupied a ""single end"". We were two floors up with a toilet between the first and second floors (bear in mind this was almost 40 years ago folks). I only remember vague details about the flat and my grand flat.

Anyway I digress. 

My mum tells me that I had a fantastic imagination. It started with seeing a lady on fire in the hallway. She said it got to the point that I wasn't allowed to play in the hall because I was taking a bucket of water into the hall to put her out!

My next friend was the tall man. I used to tell her that he was in the room with us. ""big man's here mammy"" she said I'd say. It started to freak her out she told me. It all cumulated ne night when I was getting my nightly bath in the big belfast sink by the window. Apparently I said ""hiya big man""
My mum told me she froze at this point. I was apparently looking over her shoulder beyond the curtains that enclosed the sink. 

Now the way my mum tells it is;
She turned round slowly and peeked through the gap in the curtains. What she saw was a man standing in the corner of the room. He was deathly pale and staring right at her. The odd thing was he was very tall, about 2 feet shorter than the ceiling which was 10 foot tall. She says she screamed the place down. As this happened my dad was coming upstairs from his work shift. He heard her screaming and attempted to knock down the door. My mum wouldn't move from the sink as she was too scared. When my dad eventually battered in the door he found my mum hugging me in the corner of the window alcove absolutely terrified. 

Now as my mum tells it, nothing happened for quite a few months. That was until my dad took my mum to the pictures (movies). I think my mum said the cinema was called the Regal and was in Dennistoun in Glasgow

Halfway thru the movie my mum goes rigid with fear. She's barely able to lean towards my dad because she's so scared. She whispers to him ""the man's behind us"" either actually seeing an 8 foot tall guy string there or imagining it. Of course, dad couldn't see anyone but mums ensuing panic attack meant that he had to take her home quite quickly. 

They moved out if that house soon after. They only moved two closes (doors) up the street. Mum never saw the tall man again. 

A couple of years later she told granny what she saw fearing that gran would tell her to get a grip. However my granny told her that she knew that a previous tenant of the house had killed himself by hanging whilst his wife was at the movies. Mum went a bit freaky and asked why she hadn't been told. Gran said to her ""you would never have taken the house if I had told you"". Simples. ",nosleep,joewhite2417,/r/nosleep/comments/cuuz3/one_of_my_mums_scary_experiences/

51,A college apartment ghost - True story,1280339049,"First off, I would like to point out that this story is 100% real.  There have been no fabrications, this is all true.

My sophomore year in college, my roommate and I moved out of the on-campus dorms, and into off-campus apartments, though the apartments were still owned by the school.
The apartment was much larger than the dorms, and we had a little more freedom (though we still ended up getting in trouble for EMPTY beer bottles) so we liked it.  [Here](http://imgur.com/U2HVx.jpg) is the apartment layout.  The red circles are where I saw the ghost, and the green circles are where my roommate saw the ghost.

So to get right to the messy shit...  The first encounter we had with our apartment ghost was the night after my 19th birthday.  I was asleep, and for some reason woke up around 1:30.  I’m a bit thirsty, so I roll over to get up, but I stop.  There is someone standing ON my roommate’s bed.  I’ve seen him sleepwalk once, so I assume it’s him, but then I see him move under the covers.    I can’t explain exactly what this thing was, but it was human in shape and relatively short, but it had a sort of electrical-fuzzy aura surrounding it, if that makes any sense at all.  It is doing nothing but standing presumably on my roommates feet, watching him sleep.  Obviously, I’m not fully awake, so I squeeze my eyes shut, rub them, and open them.  Only to discover the intruder is gone.  I chalk it up to being tired, so I go get some Gatorade and go back to sleep.  My roommate is an early riser, so I wake up and walk out into the living room to see him on the couch.  He jumps when I come around the corner and proceeds to tell me about the thing he saw the previous night.  His story almost exactly matches mine, the only difference being that the thing was standing at the foot of my bed (instead of on top of it) watching me.  

We stay on the lookout for more weird things, but nothing happens for a while.  After about a month, right before we head home for Christmas break, both of us have two sightings each.  One of my sightings was again at night after waking up thirsty, and again around 1:30 am.  This time, the same apparition is sitting at my roommate’s desk, just staring at the wall.  Another day, my roommate is shaving in the bathroom and leans over to rinse his face.  When he comes back up and looks in the mirror, he can see the same figure in our bedroom, looking out the window.  Our second sighting was mutual, my roommate and I are lying in our beds, about to fall asleep when we see something large move in the closet.  Just a quick glimpse of a big shadow and the sound of coat hangers hitting eachother, but nothing more.  

We were a little freaked, but the ghost never did anything to harm us, so we gave him a name (Phillip) and would try to talk to him while drunk.  During the spring semester, my roommate and I were standing in the parking lot one night with some friends, having a couple beers and talking about Phil.  He and I had our backs to the apartment, but our two friends are facing us and the apartment.  I see one of them squint and look at something behind us, so we turn around and in our bedroom window, we see something peaking out of the blinds.  We all stare for a few seconds, and then whatever it is backs away from the window, letting the blinds sway back and forth.  Like I said, this thing is hard to describe.  It’s just a short humanoid fuzzy black thing with no discernable face.  Light has no affect on it; it’s like a black hole or a void that sucks in light and doesn’t let it escape.  

Eventually, we gather up the nerve to go back inside, only to find nothing.  That was the last time anyone ever saw Phil.  With the exception of the closet incident, we never heard any noise from Phil.  He never caused any harm, or broke anything, or turned off the lights or whatever.  He was just a quiet, unsettling presence.  

We moved out the following year, but sometimes when it’s ultra boring we wish Phil had followed us to keep us company.

Edit:  removed a confusing sentence.

54,I need to know.   I just have no idea how to approach this.   Please advise.,1280306821,"Hello, nosleep.

I live in a house on the same road as the house where my family lived when I was born.   I don't have many memories living there; I was just shy of a toddler when we moved on to a different place.   Almost three decades later and many moves to many different houses in as many different cities and here I am, just a mile or so away from the place.

My family has always insisted there was something in that house, something.. I don't know, the shared experiences of my grandmother, my mother and all my aunts and uncles that told them there was something profoundly wrong with the place.

Shared dreams.
Loud footsteps in hallways and on stairs where there should be none.
Sounds of talking.   Of Crying.
Visions, hallucinations, whatever one might call them.
A general feeling of dread and discomfort.

From just lurking in this subreddit I'm sure you guys are used to more interesting, less cliché things perhaps, but I'm only going on what I was told.   No reason to exaggerate.

The last three years we lived in this house, my aunt and her husband refused to stay there.   And they don't discuss why other than sharing the knowing looks of war veterans who don't want to remember the battle, if that makes any sense.

Because it's so close, we pass this house frequently.   Almost daily.   So the stories come up pretty often.   It usually begins with Grandma mentioning something she's noticed has changed.   ""Oh, they got rid of the tree that was in the front yard"" or ""I see they put up a nice garage, that wasn't there before...   I remember when your mom and were in the living room watching television and...""   And then one of the many stories start.   I know them all, now.   I don't remind her I've heard them before and for her part they've stayed remarkably consistent over the years.   Whether it's her or my mom or any of my uncles, they don't tell these stories like we're gathered around a campfire trying to spook each other; it's always sincere.   They just share the memory like any other.   ""Remember when we saw that thing in the hallway?""
-""Oh yeah, I called mom right away, I thought someone broke in.""

That sort of thing.

For instance: My mom told me of a incident shortly after her sister's accidental death (overdose) where she saw her, clearly, standing over my crib.   Or the time her and another sister shared a dream of a boy with a knife watching them beside their bed, and they ran out of their bedrooms and met in the hallway, simultaneously.

Not exactly original material, and I could probably offer up a few explanations for what they were telling me whether it was stress or watching a cheesy horror movie after smoking a bit too much grass, or maybe the manifestation of uneasiness of being in a big house alone, but they repeat these stories and only remember them as truth.   And it's everyone in my family who lived or even visited that place.   All of them.   So I don't try to actively refute it.   I just listen.   And there are a lot of these stories.

I'll be completely honest right now- I do not believe in ghosts or spirits or the abilities of the psychic they say verified their experiences.   I don't believe in the paranormal.   It doesn't make any sense to me why ghosts and the like would only appear when someone is creeping around in the dark by themselves and not in a crowded, well lit room, for instance.   I just never bought into it.

And yet, I have to know.

I need to know.

I have to know if the people living there now have had similar experiences.

I pass that house so often and I look up at those windows on the second floor and remember what I was told they saw up there and I don't remember anything of living there as an infant, not even so much as the layout but this place just *calls out* for a visit.   A welcome home.   A return.

And I have no idea what to expect.

What I *do* expect is if I knock on the door and tell these people I was a baby back in the early 80's right in that room over there and oh by the way, do you hear footsteps on the stairs when you know there shouldn't be anyone in the hall- these people would rightfully push me the hell away from their door, call their friends and talk about the lunatic with the long hair asking questions about crazy shit.

I thought perhaps I should write them a letter.   If they don't respond, I just forget the whole thing.   Then again, what if they *do* respond?   I don't know how I'd quite react to that either.   What would I do with such information?   Perhaps they'd invite me over and they could tell me their stories, and I'd write them down, and then what?   There wouldn't be any use for it other than my own curiosity.

It's insane, it's stupid, I don't know how to go about any of this, I don't *believe* in any of this but I have to know.

I just.. 

I have to know.

What do I do?

**Edit**  Here is the letter I wrote, based on your recommendations.   (addresses, last names and info edited) Any critiques are of course welcome.

July 28th 2010

To the current resident of this house and whomever it may concern,

Hello!   My name is Timothy (last name).   My mother is Linda (last name), daughter of Barbara (last name).   Barbara, my Grandmother, owned and lived in this home from around 1975(?) to 1985.   We, the whole of Grandmother’s immediate family, lived in this house for a time during the early 80’s which I confess I don’t remember.   I had only just been born.

My grandmother and all of her children (including my mother) have always insisted there was something strange about the place.   They’ve shared somewhat bizarre stories with me of their experiences living there, things like hearing footsteps where there should be none or hearing talking or crying from just outside only to find nobody there.   Many of these stories are central to the staircase leading to the second floor.

Hopefully, you think I’m a crazy person and that perhaps they lived there but none of the rest is true.   Honestly, I’m inclined to agree.   I don’t remember anything myself, I was just an infant.   So I couldn’t say one way or the other.

But I have always been curious to know if you have had any such experiences in this particular house.

I’d very much like to speak with you about it if you have.

I don’t mean to be a bother; if you don’t have the time or even if you just plain don’t want to- I completely understand.   I won’t even expect a reply if that’s the case- you can rightly treat me as just some weird dude who has heard too many stories and I wouldn’t blame you a bit.

I’d also like to add that I’m not seeking to publish a story about this.   I’m not going to call the local news, or any news organizations for that matter.   I’m not seeking money, I’m not a “ghost-hunter”, I’m not a “psychic medium” or a priest for that matter, nor do I know any. 

This is just to fulfill my own curiosity, and perhaps I could fulfill yours as well if you would like to know some of the stories my family has repeated about your house.

And it is a lovely house, by the way.

We’re all still locals, so we pass it often.   And every time we do, they tell me about what they saw there.   And every time they do, I wonder.

Anyway, I can be reached my email, telephone or regular mail, if you prefer.   And again, if you have nothing you’d like to say, I completely understand and I won’t write you again.   I also apologize for the arrogance of this letter; I do not presume your time is worthy of my weird little curiosities.

With all my regards,

-Timothy

56,Hey a subreddit where I can finally post this. Actual true story.,1280271263,"Yeah I know all you have to go on is my word about this being real but whatever I'm telling it anyway.

About 14 years ago I lived in a house in Oregon [This one in fact](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=8615+Southeast+92nd+Avenue,+Portland,+OR&amp;sll=45.461055,-122.569442&amp;sspn=0.000974,0.001101&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=8615+SE+92nd+Ave,+Portland,+Clackamas,+Oregon+97086&amp;ll=45.461152,-122.569605&amp;spn=0.001377,0.002202&amp;t=h&amp;z=19&amp;iwloc=A)

It's a strange house. Pretty large with a nice wraparound deck a big back yard and at the time 2 big buildings in the back that made nice club houses. There were 2 bedrooms upstairs on the ground level that shared a walk-in closet and 3 bedrooms downstairs and another room I'd call a large storage room or closet.
[Here is a map](http://i.imgur.com/wlAh8.png) 

Now usually things were cool. My room had 2 windows that were at the ground level so they were pretty near the ceiling for me, tiny half windows really. 

At times I could hear shit in the walls that I was convinced were mice. It sounded as if they were sliding a piece of wood back and forth in the wall. Maybe they were playing a form of mouse soccer or something, at any rate it didn't scare me at all until one night maybe 3 or 4 months after we had been living there when the weird crap started to happen.

It started in my room I was sleeping soundly when something started scratching at my window. My window being high above my bed it was hard to see but there was a light in the back yard and my TV was on so I could just make out the face of what appeared to be a dog or something looking in the window. It was sniffing at the window and making some rather violent half snort half growl noises. Needless to say this scared me senseless and I bolted up stairs. 

At this point I should note some oddities of the evil room (*as seen in my diagram linked above*) For whatever reason we could NOT keep a light on in this room for very long. Any light bulb in the room would burn out within minutes. Any lamps on extension cords into the room from known working sockets would also experience this strange burnout. Any flashlight you took in to the room would burn out within a minute or two. You could simply NOT keep lights on in this room. There was ALWAYS a draft in the room despite there being no vent for A/C and being in the corner of the back part of the house, under ground with no windows so using a lighter was out. 

It was always noticeably colder in the room and it was often times damp. At night I could always hear the dripping of water coming from the room It had no rug just concrete. There was always a puddle on the ground but there was no damage to the ceiling so we couldn't tell where the water was coming from. Presumably the dripping noise was the source of the puddle of water but as there was no water damage anywhere it was tough to say that was the actual source. I once cleaned up and dried the puddle (*Never dripped during the day or when someone was in the room*) I put a box over the puddle to see where the water was coming from. In the morning I found the box bone dry but a brand new puddle under it complete with obnoxious *drip! drip! drip!* the night before.

Worst feature of the rooms in the basement. None of them had a door, so my room looked JUST inside the evil room of evil at all hours.

Now this is where things get a little creepy. Days after the dog or whatever it was in the window I woke up to the strangest sound. I heard whispering coming from the room. Maybe a whisper is the wrong way to describe it as there was definitely a tone to the voices but they were so low I couldn't make out what they were saying. It was clearly more than one person and the sound ended when I made any sound. This happened often enough that it became an annoyance instead of just creepy. I'd even gotten to the point that I'd yell at the room to shut the hell up to get back to sleep.

From time to time I'd hear what sounded like a large bag or box being pulled across the floor in the room and strange sniffing noises but these were less frequent than the very light whisperings. 

This all culminated one night in what remains to this day the most blood chilling experience of my life. I had become use to the whispering at this point and it didn't scare me much any more but not this time. I woke up to something at the window again only whatever it was, was just tapping lightly on the window pane. From the room I could see a red-orange glow as if there was a fire in the room. Just as I had noticed the glow I heard a very loud clattering sound as if someone were throwing tools or something around in the room. Then I heard the same voices I heard whispering only now they were yelling as if having a fight. It got so loud I doubt they would have heard me if I yelled at them to shut up. The sense of hate and dread coming from the direction of the room was almost physical enough to choke on.

Remember, my door is right next to the door to the evil room so escape, while attractive was also quite a scary prospect. I stood on my bed the sound of something tapping at the window behind me and the fight or whatever it was going on in the next room over. I finally made up my mind to make a break for it. I grabbed some scissors from the table next to the bed as some sort of weapon and as I was about to jump whatever it was in the window made a screeching sound, kind of like the cry a rabbit makes when it's being dragged off by a wolf. That was all I could stand and I was airborne. I leaped off my bed, ran past the door to the evil room of evil doing my best not to catch even a peripheral glance in the room and I tore off towards the stairs. I heard something in the room make a mad dash after me, I was absolutely terrified at this point and I had never climbed stairs so fast in my life. I reached the top door, ripped it open and ran towards my older sisters room. I flew over her, into the corner of her bed and the wall. Waking her up and scaring her half to death. She told me later that I was white as a ghost. I told her what I had heard / saw down stairs. At this point my mom came up stairs. She had apparently not noticed a thing and was wondering what the hell was going on.

I told her about it and she wrote it off as nothing but she agreed to go check it out with me. I exchanged my scissors for a large knife from the kitchen and we went downstairs together. No light, no sound, nothing could be seen or heard in the room. There was nothing at my window and there was zero evidence I wasn't crazy.

57,Backwoods near miss,1280208805,"My girlfriend and I decided to go camping for the weekend.  I knew of this great campground about an hour away.  It was right by a lake and had a nice beach to swim at.  The place also had restrooms, fire pits and basically everything a suburban camper wanted.  You get to sleep in a tent and pretend that you are roughing it despite the fact that there are about a hundred people around.  

I start packing the night before and I am debating on bringing my rifle.  I'm thinking, ""I really don't need it.  The campground is basically suburbia with tents."" 

Then I start thinking, ""well shit you never know.  It is just me and the girlfriend.  Who knows what could happen.  The campground might be empty.  The world is full of sick people and I would rather pack it than regret not having it if I need it.""  

Yeah, I am a little paranoid.  I pack the rifle and cartridges and feel pretty good about it.

Well we get a late start and by the time we get to the lake, the campground is full.  So we check the next campground and it's full.  We check every campground on the west side of the lake and they are all full.  After idling through campsite after campsite for a couple hours we are both getting a little edgy.  We start to head to the other side of the lake to check for a camping spot when we pass a sign that says, ""Red Creek Campground 8 Miles.""  The sign points down this logging road that heads west.  We discuss it for a second and decide we should check it out.  It's getting late and we want to camp.  It might be fun to camp away from everybody. 

So we start heading down the dirt road towards ""Red Creek Campground.""  After about ten minutes I start thinking about bears and thinking we better be careful with our food at night.  After about twenty minutes of driving up this road I start feeling really good about bringing my rifle.  After about 25 minutes of driving down this road I start thinking about Deliverance, the Blair Witch Project and naturally I start to think this campground better be nice, next to some really nice creek that looks like something out of a movie or we ain't staying here.  I am getting a really bad feeling at this point.

Well we must have gone at least ten miles by this point.  There was one fork in the road and a sign that pointed us towards Red Creek so I thought I was on the right track.  I come over this hill and come to an ""intersection"" on the logging roads.  I pull in the middle and stop.  There are three roads ahead of us and when I look back I see there are three behind us with one of them being the road we just came up.  I got a really bad feeling at this point.  Isn't this how countless horror movies started?  

I tell my gf that I don't like this at all.  I am worried we are gonna get lost on these damn logging roads with no signs.  There is no sign pointed towards the campground and even if we find the place who is going to guarantee that three days from now we will be able to remember which road heads back towards the main road?  She agrees and we start to head back the way we came when an old truck comes up on the road we had just taken.

Besides the fact that I had not seen anyone behind us and we have only been sitting here about thirty seconds this truck really creeps me out. This truck looks like something straight out of a horror movie.  It has black tinted windows, its painted with a mixture of black and gray primer and to top it off it has some kind of small animal skull as a hood ornament.  Did I mention that it is parked right in the middle of the road I want to take to get the fuck out of there?  

I turn our truck around and idle towards the road thinking this guy will see what I am doing and move out of the way... NOPE.  He just sits there blocking the path.  I just pop my truck in four wheel and head for the little bank right next to the road and slip on past the guy.  I look over when we idle by and I can't even see in his window because of the tinting.

We both kind of joke about that being a little creepy as we head back towards the main road.  I come to about three more forks in the road that I never even saw in the rearview when we were headed out.  I start to get nervous that I took the wrong road and we were getting lost but luckily I took the road that felt the ""most natural"" considering the way we were headed and we got back to the main road.  

We drive to the east side of the lake and find a nice little ""suburbia campground.""  I head in to talk to the lady to see if they have any spots.  They do.  I tell her about our little ""ordeal"" trying to find ""Red Creek Camp ground"" and she tells me that she lived there seventeen years and never heard of it.  I get a little mad and describe exactly where it is.  She says, ""oh yeah, bunch of logging roads out there.  No campground though I can guarantee you that.  I don't know what you were looking at or where you were headed.""

I tell her thanks and pay for our spot right next to the lake.  I am thinking about it all when I'm setting up the tent and I just start wondering... What did we just almost get into?  Someone sets up fake signs leading people out into the middle of nowhere.  That old creepy truck popping out behind us out of nowhere.  Was that guy a serial killer? Rapist?

I notice a little spider has built a nice little web between two branches on a tree.  I start to think about how it is a perfect little trap for prey.  I  decide not to tell my girlfriend that ""Red Creek"" campground does not exist.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/cu3l3/backwoods_near_miss/

Ah, the windows of the soul. How well do you really know yourself?  Don't think. Just do it, try to see what lies behind those eyes of yours, try to make out the shape of your soul.

78,Creepy family story,1279831445,"Alright, figured I'd share one of my own. This story was told to me by my great aunt (one of my grandmother's 9 sisters). 

In Cuba, where we're all from, the summers tend to get hot. Coupled with the lack of air conditioning (you'd have to be wealthy to own a unit), people tend to sleep with doors and windows open. One night, my Aunt T was putting her grandchildren to sleep. She laid in bed with them, and they were alone in the home. One of her sisters, Berta, was supposed to be keeping them company tonight, but some last minute event made her change where she slept that night. My Aunt T. says that sometime around 9 p.m. she noticed a figure who, by her description, must have been 7 feet fall. It was human shaped, but seemed to float inside their home. If it had legs, they weren't visible because a long robe of some sort covered them and dragged along her floor. At this point, rather than scream in fear, My Aunt T decides to lay perfectly still so as to not wake the children. She sees the figure cross the hallway, and head into her room, looming ominously over them. The face, she described, was that of a pale woman, with big red lips and her hair in dreads like that of a Rastafarian man. There were just shadows, cavities as she called it, where her eyes would have been. It left her room through the same way it entered, but didn't leave. My Aunt's house is large, and she swears she saw the figure go in and out of each room, take about the same amount of time, then leave. Eventually she ran out of places to in the home to visit, and simply glided out the front door. 

My Aunt cries to this very day because, the next morning, her Sister Berta was found dead. Everyone thought it must have been some sort of heart attack or stroke in her sleep because no one heard anything, and they found her where she had laid the night before, only lifeless. My Aunt swears the thing must have been Death itself, searching for her sister where she should have been. ",nosleep,Cloud7659,/r/nosleep/comments/csm0z/creepy_family_story/

80,The Lady in Red,1279816750,"“You have such beautiful eyes,” she gasped, admiration and a hint of jealousy evident in her compliment.  
  
Emma stared blankly back at her admirer, unable to understand how a woman with such a beautiful figure and gorgeous red hair could possibly find anything about which to compliment her. The woman leaned elegantly against the bar counter, casually sliding into a bar stool without so much as ruffling her tight red dress.  
  
“Umm, thanks,” Emma mumbled, embarrassedly. Unsure of how to react, she blurted out the first compliment she could think of to reciprocate.  
  
“Your hair is just unbelievably gorgeous,” she stuttered out, immediately regretting her reply and blushing a deep scarlet. Her awkward reply was met with a velvety chuckle.  
  
“I’m Elizabeth,” the elegant stranger spoke, offering her hand in introduction. “And my hair would go much nicer with your green eyes than these lousy brown things I’ve got. They’re outstanding –almost emerald!”  
  
It was an uncommon thing for Emma to visit a club on a work night. She’d only recently moved to the city, and eagerly accepted the invitation to join some of the women her age in her new apartment complex for a night on the town. A fresh town meant a fresh start. Maybe she’d even be able to have a social life here. Emma wasn’t exactly charismatic. Quiet and shy, she often faded into the background. Having few –if any- friends in the last few cities where she’d worked. Besides, her new flat was almost empty. Not all of her belongings had yet been delivered (including, to her frustration, her clothing), so there would have been nothing for her to do that evening anyhow.  
  
All of the girls she had accompanied were now dotting the dance floor, mingling or dancing with young men with too many shirt buttons undone. But here at the bar, Emma had found a new friend.  
  
“Why aren’t you out there,” Elizabeth inquired, gesturing with a nod towards the dance floor, “seducing all those handsome men with those eyes?”  
  
Blushing again, Emma responded “I’m not very good at that sort of thing. Besides, they’re not really my type of guys.”  
  
“Oh?”   
  
Feeling strangely open with this beautiful new acquaintance, Emma explained, “Well I just moved here recently. I really only came to try and make friends with the some of the girls in my apartment building.” She sighed as she observed, “they seem more interested in the boys than in hanging out with me though.”  
  
Elizabeth reached a comforting hand out to place on Emma’s shoulder. “Well personally I find you much more interesting than any of those men out there.”  
  
Emma couldn’t help grinning. She felt like she’d really made a friend.  
  
Something liquid and cold splashed suddenly all down the front of Emma’s blouse. One of the girls from her apartment had stumbled in her heels while passing, spilling her fruity club drink right onto Emma. She blurted a fast apology, but ran off quickly to rejoin the group of guys that awaited her return.  
  
“Oh dammit!” Emma cursed.   
  
Elizabeth dexterously pulled a few napkins from the counter top and began supplying them to Emma as she hopelessly tried to dry herself and her clothing.  
  
“My ride is too drunk to drive me home, and I don’t even have any clothes to change into, even if I could get back,” Emma groaned.  
  
“My place is just down the road,” Elizabeth offered. “I can walk you there and offer you a shower and some dry clothes, and I could drive you home later.”  
  
“You’d do that for me?” It had been a long time since anyone had been so kind to Emma. She felt a strange trust in her new friend, Elizabeth, so she agreed, “That would be amazing, thank you!”  
  
Elizabeth’s flat was two blocks from the club –an easy walk, just as promised. The pair walked up the three steps to the front door, lit by a small lamp. As they stepped inside, a charcoal cat fled the room and ducked into what was presumably a bedroom down the hall.  
  
“Come in,” Elizabeth invited. “Let’s get you in the shower, and then we can find something for you to put on.” She led Emma to a large bathroom near the back of the single floor flat.   
  
Emma stepped in and moved toward the shower. When she turned to thank Elizabeth again for her kindness, she was shocked to see that Elizabeth was coming in to, closing the door behind her.   
  
“Umm, Elizabeth?” Emma questioned.  
  
“Call me Liz,” she replied. “Do you mind if I join you? I want to see what other parts of your body are as beautiful as those eyes of yours.” Without waiting for a response, she slipped effortlessly out of her dress and stepped seductively into the shower, gesturing with one finger for Emma to follow her.

The bartender passed Julia a mixed drink. “From the lady in red,” he explained.  
  
A stunningly attractive woman in a tight red dress sat down beside Julia and smiled.

81,Car ride home... (One of the scariest things that has happened to me in years),1279782845,"I just want to mention that this really did happen to me, is not fabricated in anyway and deals with non-supernatural elements (at least I think...).  **Names have been changed**

I'll start off by explaining that a friend of mine told me he saw inception today, he also mentioned being followed home in his car after seeing Inception.  Then I remembered what happened to me the night I saw Inception in theaters which scares me since I had not told this guy any details of that night yet since it slipped my mind.

After seeing the film Inception (Sunday night I believe), my friends and I were planning on getting something to eat and play some board games at a friend's house.  We split up into 2 vans and 2 other vehicles, 4 or 5 people in one van, me and my buddy J  in another, and 1 person in each the 3rd and 4th vehicle.  We go off to get something to eat and decide to then meet at my friend M's house.  On our way, me and J are having a normal ride there and even help out a group of college guys who yelled out their car window asking us where to find some nice bars in our city.  All is normal but we do notice the skies are constantly filled with bursts of lighting which is coming from a far distance.  We could feel rain possibly coming cause of that awesome feeling of the wind before a storm and of course the distance thunder (which is happening very frequently).  It was a nice change to have a storm coming since it had not rained for a while, but it definitely made the night feel more creepy.


So we end up getting to our friend's house pretty early along with the 2 non van vehicles.  We decide to sit in my friend K's car while waiting, and as soon as we go to the car I'm already becoming paranoid of the really dark street we were on.  I remember jumping at the slightest tree movement from the wind cause I thought I saw something in the tree which was nothing but a squirrel or something.  So we are sitting there in K's car just waiting for the rest of our friends plus the home owner to get to the destination and would sometimes duck our selves cause we thought our friends were coming but it would not be them.  Eventually a van started to come towards us, but this time we had not decided to duck and instead had our inside lights on.  The van slowed down, came on our side of the road and drove slowly towards us.  We laughed it off, our friends were obviously being stupid.  The van kept driving towards us slower and slower, almost coming to a stop before turning back to opposite side of the street and zooming off.  We saw the person, noticing that it looked like an older fella' and definitely not our friends.  Strange, but we shrugged it off and instead had a laugh.  The friends eventually got to M's house.

So finally we went into M's house and set up somethings to play.  Trivial Pursuit and Apples to Apples were our choice that night.  We were playing Trivial Pursuit with one less person on our team since K had gotten a call to pick up his brother.  None the less we were still having fun and all until K came back and seemed to have a story to tell.  He explained that someone in a car that had a only one headlight working followed him all the way from this neighborhood to his brothers destination and then to his own neighborhood.  K had to lose him before dropping his brother up, and was pretty creeped out that this person actually waited in his car when K was waiting for his brother to get into the vehicle.  We again moved on after being surprised that someone would actually randomly follow him.  We finished our games and enjoy the rest of our stay.  Then it was time to go home.

The weather had changed drastically since much time had passed from earlier, it was now around 2 - 3 am.  The storm had finally got to us and it was raining really hard, harder than it has all summer.  We all had a nice wet run towards the van and noticed that the lighting had not died down.  J had to first drop off a different friend before dropping me off so we made our way towards their house.  No cars in sight, really dark weather, it all was pretty scary but there wasn't really anything to be scared of.  It was my turn to get dropped off, I seemed to constantly check if anyone was following us but no one was.  We get to a [Roundabout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout) and a car comes from the left side and gets in front of us.  We are behind this car and are about to take a right turn, then it signals right.  Just a coincidence I think to my self, but then it signals left as we are about to.  It goes into my neighborhood.  Again I think it could possibly be a coincidence.  Turns into my area of the neighborhood which is not that big.  Oh God I am starting to get a bit nervous.  Goes into my driveway.  Now I am really scared, what the hell is this person doing, why the hell is it in my drive way.  I tell J to park and we stop a not so far distance away.  He realizes that the car is in my drive way and we just sit for a bit hoping it might leave.  After a little while, I call my Mom because I remember that sometimes when I get dropped off she is in the living room and can see the lights.  Hoping that she has not noticed the car's headlights yet or at least not opened the door yet.  She picks up:

""Hello?""

""Mom, do not open the door, theres some strange car parked in our drive way""

I hear the noise of the door opening in my phone

""MOM, no I am serious""

""Oh Marco, just come out of that car.""

""IT IS NOT ME""

""Just hurry up and come out""


I get out of the car, my friend says something like good luck and rush to my house.  The car is still just sitting there with the inside lights on and the people seem to just ignore me, not even look at me as I open the door and go inside.  My mom is now a little shocked that I did not come out of the car she was just staring at, and I quickly lock the doors.  The car leaves after staying for maybe another minute or two.  It was probably all coincidence, but it scared the fuck out of me.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/csdah/car_ride_home_one_of_the_scariest_things_that_has/

  It's around one thirty in the morning, and I am home alone. Due to the internet, my nights are really long and the days drastically short, but since I am unemployed, it's fine. I decide to go get some noms and maybe hit the bathroom, leaving my brightly lit haven. The lights are all off to conserve some energy and save me some money, but the orange street light out side shines through the numerous windows that line my house. The trees outside cast shadows on the floor, but their shapes are familiar. Yet, as I walk, I have this increasing sense that I am being watched. I flip the lights on in every room, scan the room, flip the light off and continue on my way, still alone but still unnerved. I try not to glance through the window, fearing the worst. Instead, I open the fridge, grab a soda and turn back to the shadows on the floor. My dog who is usually quiet and stays outside, begins barking frantically. There's a new shadow on the floor that isn't moving like the rest. I look up. 

And ba-bam, creeper outside the window. And if that happened, I would shit.

So what's your worst fear (unusual or otherwise)?

90,Babydoll,1279592562,"I've never told anyone this story.  But I've got enough liquid courage in my system at the moment that I'm feeling brave enough to go through it.  When I was a teenager, I suffered from a severe anxiety and depression cocktail with an OCD and mild schizophrenia twist.  As a coping mechanism, I created something between an alternate persona and an imaginary friend.  Her name was Babydoll.  I could project all of my troubles onto her, distance myself from it all.  Then, once the problems were no longer mine, I could console and counsel her.  She helped me project my pain into a manageable point.  In my darker moments, she was so real to me.  I remember one instance in particular.  I was sitting in my parents' bathroom.  Just sitting there on the closed toilet lid, head in hands, trying to head off one of my many panic attacks.  I brought to mind the image of Babydoll.  This was the first time I ever really saw her.  She was sitting there, back against the shower door, arms wrapped around her knees.  Her black button eyes just stared at me.  She looked so bedraggled, so worn.  Her dark, lank hair hung in tatters around her solemn face.  I told her all my problems, pushed every perversion, forced every infraction onto her still form.  I knew my hurts were hurting her, but she was my only outlet.  She soaked it all up with her usual blank stare.
In the years since then, I've received help in forms both psychological and pharmaceutical.  I developed other coping mechanisms and, slowly, Babydoll began to fade from my memory.  I didn't realize that *she* hadn't forgotten *me*.  
She came to visit me last month.  I was just folding the laundry, and there she was, staring at me with those unfathomable inky depths.  I was startled at first; but, after gaining my composure, I told her that I didn't need her anymore, that everything was ok now.  She didn't say a word.  She never has.  But she didn't have to say anything.  Her cold stare was suddenly filled with a burning malice.  She's been watching me now for weeks.  Although she never speaks, I know what she wants.  She's waiting.  Waiting for me to let my tenuous grip on sanity slip even the slightest bit.  She's waiting to pay me back for every hurt, every slight, every wound.  She's waiting to draw every scream, every terrified gasp from my lungs, every stuttering beat from my heart.  She's waiting, needle and thread in hand, until my eyes bulge with the sheer weight of the horror, to transfer that lifeless stare to my petrified gaze.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/crg3z/babydoll/
91,Waking dreams,1279590919,"I used to have bad nightmares as a kid, I remember one where I was watching my impending doom in slow motion, apparently I was standing asleep in my parent's room sobbing and repeating ""I don't want to die"" again and again. The dream was scary as hell but I imagine my parents got the worst of it. Following are two stories that are unique to my experience, most likely waking dreams and not paranormal, but I think some people here might enjoy them.

Starting off with the more mundane story: I was young, 7 or 8, and I woke to my dog barking and growling. She was right outside my door staring intently out a 2nd storey floor-level window. Whatever she was looking at aroused a guard-dog reaction I only saw a few times in her thirteen years. I've seen her bark at nothing but only on rare occasions and only out the ground floor windows by the front door. So I look out and see a disturbing sight, there are a group of 5-7 men,  standing around and sitting upon some hay bales piled next to my neighbors house. The men were wearing what looked like old-fashioned early 1900s farmer's clothes, were standing very still but seemed alive not ""frozen"" even though I didn't see any movement. I looked closely for a couple minutes, trying to detect some sort of optical illusion (I was a very skeptical kid and didn't believe in ghosts) and after not being able to come up with a rational explanation I became somewhat frightened. My memory isn't clear about what I did next but I probably told my parents I had had a nightmare and slept in their bed. I doubt I would have willingly passed that window to return to my room. I resolved to check the ground for traces of hay the next day, convinced i hadn't just seen an illusion. Of course there was nothing there, nothing even I could have mistaken for hay bales or people, and I was mighty troubled by that. Nothing similar ever occurred.

Within a year from that event I was having a nightmare, I had nightmares frequently, for years it seemed like i had the same nightmare every night. I had developed a method for escaping them once I realized I was asleep, I would close my eyes tight and when I opened them I would wake up. It always worked.

At this time my sister was staying with us, a rare occasion. She was sleeping in the spare bedroom/rec room that you had to pass through in order to get to my room.

I don't remember what the nightmare was but it was a new one. I woke up and sat upright and I immediately saw a glowing human skull floating over my legs, slowly moving directly towards me. That's on my top 10 list of things I don't want to see hovering over me when I wake up. My lightning fast danger responses kicked in and I shut my eyes tight, after a second or two it was sure I would be out of the dream so I opened them up and the fucking thing is about 6 inches from my face. 

I was too scared to scream. I jumped out of my bed and ran out the door. I'm headed for my parents' bedroom but I'm stopped by something strange in the adjacent room, my sister is standing bolt upright in the middle of her bed. At least I think it's my sister. The hair color is the same and the height is right, but she's wearing an unfamiliar nightgown. She's facing away from me towards the head of the bed. I'm about to say something when I look down and see my sister sleeping quite peacefully, this figure's feet are passing through her lower back like she's standing directly on the bed. 

The skull is easy for me to explain as a product of my imagination, but something about that woman on the bed always unnerved me...

Yeah I slept on my parents' bed that night. I remember asking my mom if people got up and left their bodies when they were asleep.

For most of my childhood I could only sleep in complete darkness, even the smallest light source would keep me awake. There was another incident after which I could only sleep in bright light for years, until I was maybe 11 or 12 though I cannot remember anything about what it was that scared me so bad.

95,The island next to my house,1279478760,"(Skip to paragraph 4 if you don't want the background info)

I grew up in the suburbs, but not in the middle of no where.  Put it this way, not somewhere you would expect weird things to happen. I was never freaked out as a kid about the island next to my house, but now that I am older I am a bit more creeped out and interested in what happened on it.

So anyway, I grew up on normal suburban street, but at the end of it was a river that branched into a fork and then came back together.  The island that formed from the branching of the rivers was right next to my house and many years before my family moved there someone built a wooden bridge to get to it.  The river was only about 15m wide, but there was no road access to the island or anything like that to it. The island was big though, atleast 50m wide and 100m long - and covered in forest.

My bedroom was located on the second floor of our house and was the only bedroom to look out over the island.  Over the years I had explored every inch of the island and knew everything about it.  The only thing I ever found on it was a few glass soda bottles which I still have (they're pretty old and neat) and there was a cement stove on the island, my guess is that the previous owners had bbq'd out there. 

Now to the strange part... (I don't remember the order of these events so bare with me)
Like I said my bedroom is the only one that looks over the island.  One night I saw lights coming from the island, 2 bright lights in fact, identical to headlights.   I really thought that was strange because on the other side of the island was wetlands and no roads for at least 2km. Just trust that I wasn't seeing things, there was 2 bright lights coming from the island.  I watched as they moved around the island and the finally went out about 5 minutes later.

Needless to say the next day I was very curious to go check it out.  As I crossed the bridge I didn't notice anything so I walked around the island.  After a while I came upon a set of tracks in the mud. Even at that young age I was no idiot, I knew they were car tracks.  They didn't go for very long until I found a rusted 1930s or 1940s car.  I have no idea how old it was.  It had no engine or anything inside of it.  It was just a rusted car frame.  The tracks led directly up to the car and were in exactly the same alignment as the car.  The weird thing was, is that the car clearly could not have been driven, had never been on the island before (and there was no way to get a car to the island), and the tire tracks had trees growing between them. Even my dad had no idea how it got there.

Strange story two:
I'm getting tired of writing so I'm just going to make it short- a teenager came and knocked on our front door one day in the middle of winter to ask if he could fish off our bridge.  This was a common occurrence and of course my parents said yes.  He was dressed kind of strange though - he wore overalls, which at that time I rarely ever saw. Anyway I had never seen him before and I had lived in that neighborhood for many years.  He must not have come from far because he had no car or bike and the amount of fishing gear he carried was excessive.  I was also confused as to why someone would want to fish when there was 1 foot of snow on the ground.

My mom made me bring him hot cocoa after a couple of hours, so I walked out to the bridge and talked to him for a while as he drank his cocoa, as I left he told me he was going to try fishing from the island side of the river, and I watched him walk to the other side of the bridge and I left.  Around dinner time my mom asked me to go out and see if I could find the mug I gave the teenager.  I found the cup sitting on the bridge, still completely full of hot cocoa, and, the weirdest part, there were no foot imprints in the snow other than the small imprints mine had made.  There were also none leading to the other side of the island where I had clearly seen the kid go.  But like I said my old prints were still there...

A couple other strange things happened over the years, such as the time I found freshly burned firewood in the stove on the island.  No one ever used it and my parents said it wasn't their's and they didn't see anyone out thee.  Because I was young I never really thought much of what happened, but now I am a bit freaked out by it.

97,A few disturbing happenings in my life.,1279406230,"*Ok, So my first and second I guess supernatural encounters happened when my family was living in Maine. We lived in this not so old  but big house out in the sticks. I was about 13 at the time and in my bedroom I had a plush Mariner Moose (the mascot for the baseball team), sitting on a shelf near the end of my bed. A few weeks into living there at night I would dream that the moose would get up and and pace back and forth across the shelf. Sometimes like the moose was in deep thought, sometimes it would just be a frantic sprint and be twitchy. I wanted to make sure I was dreaming so the next day I set him in a certain spot on the shelf, put a piece of tape underneath him so I knew exactly where. That night I had the dream again. Woke up the next morning and the moose was sitting at the farthest point from where I set him that night.  I was freaked out by that point and thought maybe I wasn't dreaming at all.

 *My next story takes place in the same house, and further provoked my belief that the house was haunted.  My mom started a little Christmas wreath making business in garage.  They would have the radio on and be listening to music while decorating the wreaths. At about the same time everyday the radio would somehow change the station to this old time 40's music. We thought for a bit that the radio station just changed what was playing. So one day we decided to watch it. It got to about that time and we notice the knob on the radio is actually turning by itself to the old time station. Mom was promptly freaked out and unplugged the radio that day and continued to make wreathes in silence.

  *My next story takes place in northern California, Me and a few friends were driving home form Dillon beach at about 2 in the morning. I was the DD and completely sober. My friends were all pretty high in the back seat.  I was driving a jeep wrangler with the top down so no protection from anything. We are about a mile from the beach and anyone who has been around the coast knows it can get really foggy at night. well it was. Thick fog and I was driving slow so didn't go off the road on one of the many curves.  My friends are all having a time laughing and telling stories and then I slam on the brakes. They get all mad and say what the hell was that for.  I just said ""look"", and in front of the jeep, illuminated by the headlights was this.. thing. It had an arched back, it was pretty hairy, but pieces seemed to be falling off. It wasn't walking normally like a dog, it kinda waddled and it was bigger then a dog, the arched back easily went up higher then the hood of my jeep.  And the walk,  the walk is what made it bad. It was twitching across the road, like it was having a seizure or something. At that point I didn't see its face until about the time hit the other side of the road, where it froze and snapped its head and looked at all of us in the car. Then it got up on its hind legs and sprinted into the woods. The face looked not of a dog or bear or anything wild that could have been there. It really is indescribable but looked like somewhat of a mix between dog and human. I legitimately believe I saw a werewolf that night. We all do. I floored it after that and was pretty much freaking out the next few weeks.

Something about the way it was written made it feel like it really was an eyewitness account, and it hit some kind of primal nerve in my brain that scared the hell out of me.  I didn't save it when I saw it the first time, and I didn't save it the one time I saw it surface on /x/ over on 4chan.   Googling it hasn't turned up anything, so I'm hoping that someone might recognize it and have a copy floating around.

Anyway.  On with the story.  It was about a couple high schoolers (I think) who stopped off at a playground - maybe behind a church - one night after a school dance.  They were sitting on the swings when the boy became aware of movement on the ground where the surrounding woods met the edge of the playground.  After a second, they realize there's something *crawling* towards them that looks like an armless/legless person.  They beat it out of there, and come back the next day to investigate where they find deep furrows in the mud by the swings and the edge of the forest where *something* had been writhing around on the ground.

1,Late at work,1279397171,"I'm back in engineering graduate school, and this summer I landed a great internship at a big tech company in the Northeast.  The company is located in a giant, oddly shaped building off of a minor highway, forty-five minutes or so outside of a large city.  It's relatively rural, in other words, surrounded by forest on three sides, with a large parking lot that winds down to the road.  As I said, the building has a strange shape -- it's mostly square, but there is one corner which forms a ""V,"" and my cubicle happens to be right in the upper corner of one side of the V, such that I (and my cubemates -- we might have a corner-cube with windows, but there are three of us in here!) look out one of the large windows more or less directly into the windows in the other side of the V.  For some reason, that part of the building is vacant (I think the plan is to expand over there), and all that I can see is a couple of chairs and a fold-up table propped next to one of the windows.  It's a pretty big open space altogether.

Now, I used to be a high school teacher, and as it turns out I was asked if I could teach summer school in the same city where I'm working (it was a strange coincidence that I'm in town, actually).  Because of my full-time job, I declined the offer, but the school was in a bind and desperately needed a substitute teacher for one week, and I asked my boss if I could take the mornings off for one week and come into work late.  He said that was fine, as long as I worked a full 40-hour week, meaning I'd be in the office until 8 or 9pm each day that I taught.  I figured that I could handle 13-hour days for a week, so I decided to do it.  So, last Monday, I taught in the morning, and arrived at work at about 1pm.

The first couple of days of my evening work-week were pretty typical.  The office was bustling until about 5:30pm, at which time people started to trickle out of the office.  Most of the lights stayed on, but they must be on some sort of timer, because at about 7pm about half of the lights went out, and the office definitely seemed more deserted, and it had that ghost-town feel to it.  But, I had my work to do, and I didn't really notice.  I finished up about 8:30pm, turned off my computer, and headed down to my car, which I parked about half-way across the large parking lot.

Wednesday night, though, things got a bit strange.  First of all, more lights than normal went off at 7pm, and there were probably only about twenty percent of the lights on.  I definitely noticed, but didn't worry about it, and I didn't really mind working in the semi-dark.  As I went to leave that night, I went to open the door into the main hallway (it's got a sensor that unlocks it when you walk up), but it didn't open automatically.  I had to manually press a switch that unlocked the door.  Again, no worries -- maybe the sensor was on the same switch as the darkened lights.  I walked down the hall and down the main staircase, out the front door, and then into the parking lot, over to my car, which was alone in the center of the lot.  It was dark out, but the moon was shining, and the car glistened in the moonlight.  The car happened to be facing towards the building, and as I got into my car to leave, I happened to look back at the building, and I noticed that the empty room on the other side of the V had the lights on.  I thought this was odd, as I would have thought I would have noticed it from my darkened office right next to it.  I didn't really think too much of it, though, and I turned on the radio and went my way.

Thursday night, almost all of the lights went out at 7pm.  I began to think this was strange, being in my giant building all alone with the lights out, and I did start to get a bit creeped out.  I jumped when the A/C fan went on at one point, and I began to hear what I thought were steps along the cubes next to me.  I also thought I heard someone typing on the computer in the cube directly on the opposite side of where I sit.  I figured I was just tired, from the long days and all the work.  At about 8pm, I was sitting at my desk when I noticed out of the corner of my eye that the lights in the empty room had suddenly gone on.  As I swung my head over to look, they immediately went off, but I thought that I had seen a tall figure standing in the room, facing me from the window (which is about 15 feet from my window).  I got a cold shiver straight down my spine, and I decided that I'd worked enough for the day.  I packed up and got ready to leave.  I made my way (in the dark) towards the door but of course the automatic switch on the door didn't work again. Unfortunately, neither did the manual switch.  I panicked a bit, but then noticed an exit sign all the way down the other end of the hall, and I made my way towards it.  I ended up at another stairway (lighted, thankfully) and I went downstairs and found another exit out of the building.  It was a darker night, and I quickly made my way to my car, jumped in and tore out of the parking lot.

Friday night (last night) was my last day with the crazy schedule.  All afternoon I kept thinking about what might happen after everyone else had left, and I was already nervous by about 6:30pm.  At 7pm, the entire building went dark; the only light came from my computer monitor, and it gave my cube an eerie glow.  I could barely see to type, and I jumped at every little sound.  Again, I thought I heard typing, and there seemed to be more steps next to my cube.  I didn't dare leave the cube, but I started to plan my escape, wondering what was really going on.  By 7:30pm I had had enough, but just then I heard tapping on the window next to me (towards the empty office).  I almost had a heart attack, until I realized that it was just rain -- a storm had quickly blown in, and it was pouring out.  I took a deep breath, and finished putting my stuff away.  As I clicked off the computer monitor and stood up (leaving me in complete darkness), there was a tremendous bolt of lightning outside.  I turned to look, facing the empty office, and there was another huge lightning bolt.  The entire office next door was lit up.  And in each of the five windows stood a figure, arms at his sides, staring directly back at me.  I screamed and it was, of course, instantly dark again.  I totally panicked, grabbed my bag and went running for the door.  Amazingly, it opened with the manual switch, but the door to the stairway I normally took was locked--I didn't even know you could lock stairway doors.  I didn't know what I was going to do and then I noticed that there was a lighted exit sign down a different hallway, one which I had never been down.  As I started running towards the exit sign I realized -- I was running in the same direction as the empty office.  I stopped dead in my tracks, and didn't know what to do.  I decided to go for it, and I bolted towards the sign, which was like a glowing lighthouse -- the only thing I could see.  Just as I passed what must have been the doors to the empty office, the doors flew open, and I got knocked sideways, like I'd been hit by a train.  I careened into the wall, but somehow I managed to keep running.  I didn't dare look behind me, but somehow kept running for the stairs.  The next thing I knew, I was down the stairs and outside, into the thunderstorm.  I rushed to my car, fumbled with my keys and lept into it, driving as fast as I could out of the lot, towards home.

I didn't sleep much last night, but this morning as I was watching TV while eating breakfast, I saw a news report that said there had been a tornado that had gone through the town where I work.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw my building--they were showing the corner V and you could see that the empty office had been blown to smithereens.  I haven't talked to anyone from work yet today, but I'm definitely glad that my crazy week is over.

2,Just a Game,1279396230,"When I was in high school, I was just getting started with a Playstation and some of the cool games associated with it.  One of the games in particular was Resident Evil 3.

I was (and still can be) an easily frightened guy, so when I was 15 or so, playing this game in the dark of a somewhat old house did not make for good sleeping habits.  I recalled several times where I would turn the game off and curl up in a ball in front of the TV, believing with my whole heart that if I turned around, Nemesis would be waiting for me.  But enough of that.

My mom slept in the living room on the couch because a) she was crazy with mental health issues and b) her bedroom was cluttered up and she hadn't finished putting it back together.  We had two bathrooms but after taking apart one bathroom (the downstairs), the bath tub was no longer functional and our only resort was using the upstairs bathroom, which was right next to my sister's room.  My sister's room had a rather sturdy door that required you to turn the handle at least halfway around before pushing against it to open it up.

Two weeks after I had borrowed the game from my good friend, I was still playing it quite regularly.  It was on this day that I went upstairs, passed by my sister's closed door, went into the bathroom and took a bath.  I finished up in the bathroom, came outside, and my sister's door was wide open.

I thought nothing of it, since I had a dog in the house of medium-large size (Labrador), so I thought he somehow opened it.  Every day for the next two weeks, even after I quit playing Resident Evil 3, the door was open when I left the bathroom after taking a bath.  I had figured something was going on on the 3rd day, since neither my dog nor my family were in the house (I was home alone and the dog was outside in the fenced in yard).

On the second week of this strange activity, my mom had fallen asleep watching a movie and had horrific dreams.  She came to me frantically, saying something ""evil"" was near the television and that I had to get rid of it.  I fessed up about borrowing the game and she demanded I take it out of the house this instant.  I also fessed up about the door being open and she said the game was ""demonic"" and that I should not have it anymore.  I did what she asked because she did supply the roof over my head, but instead of getting rid of the game, I placed it on the front porch.

The next day when I went to take a bath, as per my usual daily schedule, my sister's door remained closed.  I thought I was a little crazy at first but sure enough, the door was not open whenever I would go take a bath.  This repeated for a week until I snuck the game from outside and played it a little more.  The next morning when I went in the bathroom again, my sister's door was open when I left.  I immediately returned the game to my friend and told him of the event, to which he thought was really cool.

Fast forward a few years towards my senior year in high school.  I ask my friend (same one) to borrow his game and play a bit more.  I said I was too old for ""ghost stories"" and that the past events were just a coincidence.  I brought the game home and marathoned for about 8 hours and went and washed up in the bathroom later in the evening.  When I got outside, the door to my sister's room was wide open. (again, I was alone in the house)

I promptly got dressed, put the game back in its case, drove to my friend's house and gave him back the game.  I have yet to play it again.",nosleep,saerak,/r/nosleep/comments/cqpo7/just_a_game/

5,Just a collection of strange little happenings.,1279388989,"Just a few creepy things from my childhood/adulthood. If you're really into scary as shit stories, don't read this, it's just small little creepy happenings.

When I was younger and I was afraid of the dark, I used to sleep in my older sister's room. We never had anything bigger than twin size matresses so she had no room for me on her bed, so I slept on the floor. Every single time I slept on the floor, I was awoken EVERY NIGHT by the feeling of someone stepping on my back or on my arm. Not a child, but a grown man with heavy shoes on. It hurt so bad, it startled me out of sleep every night. When I woke up, I never saw anybody there. But I was always scared shitless.

One time I was sitting with my sister (the same one) in her room when all of a sudden she stares at one of her posters and starts screaming bloody murder. It scared me too (I was very young) so I started screaming as well. she ripped down the poster off the wall and my mom came in the room and tried to console us. My sister said that she saw a figure of a man screaming at her to get out of the house, and that it was HIS house we lived in. She still remembers it to this day, but nothing awful has happened in the house since besides sightings of a man in the kitchen.

I had a party when I was around 12 years old, and one of my friends got nauseous and laid down on the couch. A few months ago, we were reminiscing about middle school years, and she brought up the party. She said she had seen a man in my kitchen walking around. At the party, she asked me when my dad got to the party. I had told her that he was in another state. There were no other men in our house at the time, my mom has always been single. She had seen (what a lot of other people, including my sisters had seen) what everyone in my house thinks is the ghost of my dead stepfather Johnny, who killed himself shortly after I turned twoish. He shot himself in the head.

I've never had any sleep paralysis, but I've always had the most awful nightmares. I won't share any unless upon request, because they are too long and this post is really long anyway. I usually have nightmares around 1-3 times a year, but sometimes more. A few months ago I suffered from one of the worst I've ever had. I woke up around 3:30 am, sat in bed, crying for a few minutes, and then finally found the courage to close my eyes and run to the other side of the room to find the light. I then banged on my sister's door across the hall, sobbing, not knowing what to do. I told her about the dream and she told me to calm down and do something else for an hour or two, and try sleeping again. So I got on the computer for a while and then slept. When I woke up in the morning, I didn't even remember a bit of the dream. Really strange, because I'm very in touch with my dreams and wake up remembering at least 2 each night.

DAE dream frequently and remember so much a night?

Anyway, sorry about the long EVERYTHING, I've never told anyone any of this and it's just been eating at me for years.

tl;dr:

Slept in my sis' room when I was little, woke up to someone stepping on my back, nobody was there.

Sister saw a violent ghost in her wall, but nothing has happened since.

Friend at a party saw the ghost of my dead stepfather Johnny.

8,Dear NoSleep: I might actually have an opportunity to meet my Doppelgänger. Should I do it?,1279252585,"So here's the story:

About 4 days ago, I met up with friends for drinks at a bar we've never frequented, but have always passed by. So anyways, it's my turn to go and get a round of drinks and so off I go to the bar and before I have a chance to ask, the bar waitress pours me a schooner of beer. Now I'm curious as she smiles and hands it over to me and tells me 'Hey Marten (not the actual name she used), did you get out of work early today?.""  I tell her she must be mistaken - I'm not Marten. She doesn't believe me and it takes 3 of my friends to vouch for me that I've **never** set foot on this bar before that night before she starts to believe I'm not bullshitting. She's astounded and tells me a guy who looks *exactly* like me called Marten (again, not the name) has been coming to this place almost every Friday night for drinks for almost a year and has occasionally flirted with her. She looks really freaked out and I honestly believe she thinks she's met someone who looks like me in the light of a bar at least. My friends are absolutely apeshit about taking me there to meet 'Marten' as soon as possible.

Now, tonight, myself and some friends will meet yet again, and by unanimous vote, we're all going to the same bar to see if Marten shows up.But now I'm wondering if I shouldn't go and stay put rather than risking meeting Myself? Reading up on the subject, I've heard that this is a **bad** idea, since it usually precludes Death of some sort. What do you guys think? For Science? Or should I just stay the fuck away? Your thoughts are welcome....

**EDIT:** I'm still to hear a convincing argument as to why this isn't *safe*, so if I die a horrible death, then it's on your conscience. I will therefore go and meet my evil twin tonight... It's been nice knowing you all :P

10,I don't sleep anymore.,1279206834,"Earlier this week, on Sunday night, I had a dream in which I knew I was asleep. I was standing outside of my house in torrential rain at night and thought I needed to get inside in order to wake up. I approached the front door and placed my knuckles onto the door-window ready to knock. I knew that my next action would bring me one step closer to consciousness. The moment I knocked on the door, the thudding sound of the knock was so loud, so frightening and so real that it woke me from my sleep.

*BANG BANG BANG*

I jumped up immediately and listened out for a further knock at the door. I was roasting hot, sweating profusely and my heart was beating so hard, I don't think I would have been able to tell the difference between a knock at the door and my thudding heart beat. After I came to my senses and realised that the possibility of the door knocking at the exact moment of dreaming it is incredibly low, I fell back to sleep.

Monday, the very following night, I had the same dream. Right back outside the front of the house in the pouring rain again, intensely staring at the house. I slowly walked to the front door, this time it was open. I walked in and went straight into the kitchen. I opened the cutlery drawer and pulled out the largest meat knife I have. I looked into my reflection through the blade of the knife.

If you stare directly into the reflection of your eyes for long enough, eventually it will hit you that someone is looking at you. You know it's your reflection, but for just a second, you forget and become self conscious, as if it's somebody else behind your reflection's eyes. It didn't take a second of looking at my reflection through the blade to realise that somebody else was looking back. The moment I realised it was somebody else wearing my grin in the reflection, I slammed the cutlery drawer shut.

*BANG*

Again, I shot up out of bed. The sound of the metal clanging in the drawer as it abruptly closed was so defined and so crystal clear, it couldn't have been a dream. Really spooked this time, I went downstairs into the kitchen. I was half asleep and had to check. I opened the cutlery drawer. I was relieved to find the knife still in the drawer. I closed it and went back to bed. It took a little longer this time, but I fell asleep.

Tuesday night, my dream started with that grin in the reflection. From the look in his eyes, I could tell that the man in the reflection knew he was looking back at someone confused and scared. I found myself looking into the reflection of the knife, already in my hand, while standing outside of my house in the rain. The front door was open again. I walked into the house, directly up the stairs and into my bedroom. I looked at the bed and saw someone sleeping in it. It was me.

I knew what I was going to do, but also knew that I couldn't stop myself. Instead, I kept thinking over and over again ""Wake up"". My emotions were both in two extremes at once. I was terrified, but at the same time I was thrilled and excited to kill. ""WAKE UP!""

I shot right out of bed and stood up. I was absolutely drenched in sweat, roasting hot, but relieved to find nobody standing in front of me with a knife. It took a few seconds to realise that I was gripping something tight in my hand. I knew what it was even before I looked down at it and saw my reflection in it. It was the meat knife, and this time the reflection in it looked terrified. I don't sleep anymore.",nosleep,RoosterSheep,/r/nosleep/comments/cpwt0/i_dont_sleep_anymore/
11,My friends and I were playing with a Ouija board. It's real. (story inside),1279012649,"A group of friends is staying from Connecticut and New Jersey. They came down to hang out. We thought It would be a good idea to use a Ouija board. We sat down at the table with 12 people around. Mind you, my house is well over a hundred years old.

We started out by rubbing the cursor around for a while. Once the lights were off and the candles were lit, everyone went quite. For a board to work you need at least three people barely touching the cursor. Their energy is transfered and is used to move the cursor. We started out with a simple ""Are there any entities present?"" With much surprise the cursor moved to the ""yes."" Everyone got excited and started talking. We asked another question but no answer, probably due to the noise.

We started fresh. The three people touching it were my brother's girlfriend, a family friend (brought over the board), and another close friend of ours. They again started with the simple ""Are there any entities present?"" The cursor moved to ""yes."" We asked why he was here after asking the obvious questions like ""M/F?"" ""How old are you?"" He answered with ""R.S."" the initials of my brother's girlfriend.

The question's flowed like water, the cursor constantly moving with an eerily reminiscent scrape. What we got was, was that the entity was RS's grandfather (deceased)  and that he died in Pearl Harbor in WWII. We asked his intials and got ""AMAMAMAMAM..."" We also found out that the spirit was from RS's side of the family from Hawaii. He was there to watch over her. There was also another spirit, which was her grandmother. In the end the spirit was good, but also hated one of our friends because he was black. It was a good laugh.

Then, after a break, we kept summoning more spirits. These spirits were angry. One spelling out my mother's name(No one likes her. She is despised by my family and no longer lives with us. Her name was completely random and scary.), and another spelling out ""HATE"" after asking it's purpose for being here. We immediately left the convorsation.

Our final talk was with a random spirit watching over my brother's girlfriend/RS. She said something for my brother. It was, ""Dear Jack please do good."" We all stopped and thanked the spirits. I swear this was real.

18,"And the white figure just stood there, at the foot of my bed",1278650308,"My boyfriend and I both awoke with a start just before 1 AM to the sound of cats hissing and swiping outside our window. It was loud, and upsetting. He got out of bed and found Hobbes, our indoor Bengal cat, no longer sleeping on one of the shelves in the closet. Hobbes seemed awake and cautious, and after a few minutes of being consoled, he joined us and curled up on my right shoulder as is his preference.

After falling asleep I experienced some strange dream involving giant factories and smoke stacks emitting massive plumes of smoke—the kind of sequence that makes for little narrative sense but immense visual remembrance. It ended with me standing inside some sort of victorian-style house, watching an old lady walk slowly up a flight of creaky steps. She stopped at the top of the stairs, and stared into the bathroom that faced her. She was looking intently at a bottle of pills resting on the sink.

I don't know how to describe it, but she realized something about the pills, and I became afraid of them. This realization seemed to last forever, and it felt intensely uncomfortable. And, in retrospect, I realize that this is exactly how [sleep paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis) begins: Something catches my attention, and I realize that it just isn't right, and by then... Well, by then it's too late.

I opened my eyes slowly and automatically, and saw my boyfriend to my left and Hobbes to my right. In front of me, at the foot of the bed, was some unnaturally tall white figure looking at me. [This classic movie poster](http://img.skitch.com/20100609-kictik4ajg6m8nbwit5ubdgwjb.png) is a pretty good representation, only the figure was skinnier and completely, ghostly white.

What disturbed me most about the figure was that instead of a head, or even a face, it had a sea of hands, stretched out towards me, blurred by their grabbing motions. I tried to scream and remember vividly thinking (as I always do when experiencing this) that I could get my boyfriend's attention and wake him up, or that Hobbes would notice, yet neither of them did. Eventually I stopped yelling and when I did, all I could hear was the figure saying ""Laugh! Laugh!"" over and over again, in monotone, as if three people were repeating it but periodically interrupting each other.

I finally awoke, and after petting Hobbes for what must've been about fifteen minutes, I opened my computer and wrote this down. I've experienced a lot of sleep paralysis over the years, but this experience in particular is one of the worst.

22,I had a rather strange experience today...,1278545234,"To preface this, I should say that as a younger person, I was extremely superstitious.  I broke that habit (at least consciously) around 4 years ago at the end of high school.

So today I was going down to the basement in my house to finish up the laundry.  As I walked down the steps, I heard an odd noise and stopped to listen.  To my surprise, it was music, and it was emanating from the basement.  I went all the way down and found my stereo was on and playing a radio station rather loudly.  I figured someone must have set an alarm accidentally, because I was the only one home.  So I went to shut it off, and as I did I realized what song was playing at the lyrics, ""*Pleased to meet you, won't you guess my name?*""

Would not have believed it if it hadn't happened to me.  Either a major coincidence or something a bit more interesting.

**tl;dr**: Found the stereo in my basement had turned itself on and was playing a song specifically about the devil.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/cn2o0/i_had_a_rather_strange_experience_today/
23,I think I was visited by a ghost in my dream last night.,1278475613,"My GF reads this subreddit, and she'd vouch for my being a stubbornly rational person. I don't believe in ghosts, astral projection, crystals, or homeopathy—*in that order* (just kidding; I try to have a sense of humour about it, tho). I cannot, however, say that just because I don't believe in something, that certain things can't happen to change my mind.

The story is short and simple: This past long weekend we took a long, seven-hour motorcycle trip through the Canadian rockies to the Okanagan. We were staying in the home of my GF's mom's boyfriend, a retiree that  lives in a retirement community there. Although just barely retired himself, he had been living in the community with his extremely elderly parents, both in their 90's. He'd recently put his parents in a home because they were getting on, and in fact, a few months after going into the home, his mother became ill, refused to eat, and died.

At best, the relationship between the parents seemed tense, full of angry, confrontational energy. Once, while staying downstairs beneath their bedroom, my GF could hear them having an argument, with lots of fighting and yelling back and forth. As a stranger to the family, the thing that struck me the most was that their voices sounded full and healthy, their angry words seemed to both come from their chests at full volume. In the mornings, at the breakfasat table, they were frail and weak, barely able to speak (not to mention asking us our names many times throughout breakfast, even introducing themselves to me for what they thought was the first time, as I sat down after getting up to get jam out of the fridge). But later that night their voices were discordantly strong. They were both young again. ""You happy now??"" 

Six months later, my GF and I are asleep in their bedroom. We made dinner the first night, and everyone drank a glass or two of wine or beer, so we went to bed a bit tipsy. I fell easily into a deep asleep.

I dream a lot. In fact, I've always felt that my most natural state was asleep, dreaming. In my dream that night I was in my home office, the lights off, the neighbourhood quiet, and I'm standing in a bathtub. For some reason, it was warm and sudsy and full of laundry. ""Why is there wet laundry in my office??"" I wondered. Then suddenly, something struck me, forcefully, surprisingly hard, pushing me into the corner, against the wall. I could feel clearly that I had been struck by something totally foreign, outside my own thoughts. 

Though my dreams can be fantastic, or even [poignant](http://owlstretching.blogspot.com/2005_04_01_archive.html), I tend to be very measured in my dreams. ""What the hell was that??"" I asked, forgetting about the laundry. I turned around towards my office and there, leaving, was a small, grey shape, about the size of a seven year-old child. It had thin arms and legs, and a tall, elongated head. 

I knew I would encounter it in the adjoining hallway, so I got up and, yes, standing there facing me was a small, completely featureless child, dressed in what looked like a grey, one-piece outfit (almost like a fencing suit). Its head was oblong and tall, and it had no face, just a circular border where its face should be. I sensed it was wearing a mask, and that it could see—

Suddenly, it hit me again, angrily, forcefully, totally unprovoked.

The hit was strange. It did not hurt, but I could feel the intentions behind it were dead serious.

""Is this me?"" I wondered. For a moment I thought perhaps I had encountered myself as a child, and that I was inadvertently expressing some repressed, childhood trauma towards myself somehow. ""It's OK,"" I said, as reassuringly as I could. ""You're safe here. If I have something you need, you can have it. Take whatever you need.""

Suddenly, I was aware of my sleeping self, my body, asleep on my stomach on the bed. From the middle of my back, I felt an extremely strong, slow wave of energy lift up and out, pulling like a thin curtain, up and out of me.

""Was that what you need?"" I offered. ""Take more if you need it. You are not stealing from me. I am infinite. I can make more. Have as much as you need.""

Another, somewhat smaller wave of energy fell off my back and, I sensed, into the creature. Then I was alone in my hallway.

I have never had a dream like this. For several weeks now, my GF's brother has been after them to ""cleanse"" (or smudge?) the house, to rid it of any potential negative energy. Several days later, after discussing it with everyone, that's what we did.

I had a couple more vivid dreams, but mainly, I attributed those simply to being on vacation in a strange house (ie, a wave of robberies using fake guns. Then a robber dashes into the restaurant I'm eating at, holding a gun. Is it fake? Is it hero time? Or... could the gun be real this time?). Nothing else even remotely close happened.",nosleep,catsfive,/r/nosleep/comments/cmqmc/i_think_i_was_visited_by_a_ghost_in_my_dream_last/

35,Still not sure what I saw...,1277773568,"Reading these nosleep posts have got me thinking about this.  Back in high school, me and a few of my friends were pretty interested in supposedly haunted places in the area we grew up, so it was only a matter of time before we ended up [here](http://www.prairieghosts.com/voorhies.html).  

We went ""ghost hunting"" one night, or at least our version of it that consisted of sneaking and trespassing on property that we were pretty sure was private, armed with flashlights and cameras.  Spread between two cars, six of us were taken first to some grain silo which our leader claimed was the former site of a witch's cottage, which we all agreed was a load of bunk.  The next location was slightly more believable.  

We pulled into a gravel drive marked with a town sign labeled ""Voorhies,"" which was indeed an unpleasant name considering the associations of everyone's favorite hockey-masked murderer.  We were told the place was called ""Voorhies Castle,"" but little else about its lore, save that the place around the castle was once actually a town with a clocktower, but tornadoes had ripped through the town on a few occasions and taken out most of its buildings, including the clocktower.  

As we followed the driveway, I saw a small church to the left of the road.  Its presence would've been less ominous had there been more buildings, but considering its only accompanying structures consisted of a trailer out by the main road, and the castle itself.  The driveway led to a smaller path off this road, still large enough for a car to travel on, so we took our two-car convoy to follow it.  It led to a loop in front of the house, never actually leading to it in the first place.  The area, for the most part, looked abandoned, but having been told a rumor that the house's current owner had a son that liked to hang out at night with a shotgun, we were not terribly interested in stepping out of the cars just yet.  

We took a drive around the loop--not a huge loop, mind you, but one obviously implemented to at least provide a roundabout.  There were only two light sources on the property, both of which were street lights placed on the west and east sides of the building.  Other than that, there was an eerie calm that had settled on the property as we peered at the face of the building.  

It was a spooky enough house:  large, Victorian, definitely out of place on the Illinois prairie.  It was certainly a candidate for a small-town legend, if it actually sat in a small town and not in the middle of BFE.  The house had its towers, its numerous windows--its structure was intimidating, to say the least.  It just so happened that in one of these windows of one of these towers is where we saw it.  

In its southeast tower, on the first floor window, we saw a blue figure, human in appearance, but otherwise featureless.  It did not move, just stood there.  Featureless as it was, I got the sensation that it was peering back at us.  We all saw it at once, and we all responded at once.  It wasn't fear that consumed us but rather excitement mingled with utter dumbfoundedness.  We ordered the car in front of us to do another loop around, and we too followed to get a look at it.  By this time, adrenaline coursed through us almost synchronously, and we continued our hooting and hollering in the Cavalier.  I was in the backseat next to our designated cameraman (read:  only guy with a video camera), and asked him if he had gotten any of it on video.  By this time, we had high tailed it out of there, again not quite out of fear but more excitement, and he looked down at the camera and told me, ""Oh shit, it was off."" 

That night, I was fairly convinced that I had some sort of run-in with the paranormal.  Since then, my belief has probably wavered, still trying to rationalize it with a trick of the light, but after reading this I'm not so sure:  

&gt; He finally quit working there, another witness told me, after he was startled one night by a shadowy figure in the east tower.

46,Better than Ever,1277343110,"Not many people realize how long ago telephones were invented. The idea was first thought of 1844, and the first successful transfer of human voice came in 1876. Because of the outstanding practicality and genius, problems with the early phones were ignored.

The most alarming of which were strange phone calls people would receive. Sometimes it would be horrible screaming or crying. Other times it was laughter. Even more disturbing was when people received calls from dead friends or family. Most people claimed that the deceased would repeat the same words over again, or a name. Even more peculiar, the calls usually increased in frequency when you tried communicating with the voices.

Most people didn't understand the science behind it, so proponents found it easy to downplay this morbid defect. The voices of the deceased? Simply old calls that were ""stuck"" in the wires, getting delayed for months after the individual passed away. With the advancement of the telephone and more systems and operators to screen calls, these defects became extremely rare. Each decade saw less and less reports of these defects, with the exceptions of the 1920s and the 1940s.

Despite over a hundred years to work out the problems, every now and then these phone calls still come in. So if you ever receive a strange phone call from a loved one, saying your name over over again, or just a voice crying inconsolably - At least you now know it's just a defect. Maybe you can take some comfort knowing that by far, most of the calls you would have gotten have been blocked out.",nosleep,KaiserInch,/r/nosleep/comments/cidf6/better_than_ever/

48,Creepy pasta: Notes,1277240891,"

All this shit started when I found that little note.
On a square piece of paper I found at the bottom of a box I was moving out of my basement, it read, ""HELLO? PLEASE RESPOND"". I had no idea how long the paper had been there, those boxes had sat in my basement since I moved in. I ignored it until the next morning, when I opened my coffee maker to throw out the grounds, and inside was a sopping wet piece of paper that read ""PLEASE RESPOND! PLEASE HELP"". I figured it must have been put inside my coffee maker by whoever was pulling this pointless prank, because it wasn't there when I put my coffee grounds in.
I found more notes, under my mousepad, inside my computer tower while I was putting in some new RAM, between the layers of tissue of my toilet paper roll, under my DVD player's disc tray. Places that no one would ever look, places you'd never think of putting a note, places you knew no one would ever look and it would be foolish to put a note, because who knew when they would see it?
But it kept happening, and they all said the same thing every time, begging me to respond and help them. Being the retard I am, one day I just got fed up when I found one inside a cup in my dishwasher(right after I had run it- the paper was dry) I wrote on the back of it ""HELLO. I'M RESPONDING. PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR SITUATION!"" and slid it under a crack in my bath-fitted tub.
No sooner had I left my bathroom did I find another piece of paper, floating on the surface tension on the surface of my glass of sprite I had in the living room.

I carefully picked it out of my drink, it read ""THANK YOU."" and in larger letters, ""I'M TRAPPED"".
I waved it around to dry it off a bit, and wrote on the back of it again, ""where are you trapped? how are you sending me notes?"" and, not creative enough to think of where to put it, I just threw it behind my couch. I waited and looked, but I didn't see any other notes for the rest of that day.
The next day I checked my mail, inside of some spam letter was the next note, ""IN THE SECOND DIMENSION. BELOW YOU"". I wasted no time in responding ""whoever you are, this prank is retarded. give it a rest"" and threw it outside, the wind blew it away.
The next note I got was still in obnoxious capital letters, though it was much longer than before and the last sentence seemed to have been squeezed into the remaining space. I think it was a passage from some encyclopedia or textbook. ""The first dimension is a defined point in space. The second dimension (this was underlined) is anything that exists with height and width, while the third adds on length. The fourth includes time, the and the fifth is the past: time that has already occurred and is solidified in timespace."" Everything beyond that was too squished in to read. I rolled my eyes and responded again, ""How can you read this if you're in the second dimension? How can you even exist??"" I slipped this note into the space in my toaster between the element and the metal casing.
my reply came when I brushed it out of my hair the next morning before I took a shower. ""WRITING IS 2D. VISION IS 2D- TWO 2D IMAGES SUPERIMPOSED.""
That didn't really get to the point of how I was supposed to ""rescue"" this person, which I defined in my next note that I flushed down my toilet.

""MAKE ME 3D"" was all that was on the new slip of paper I found inside of a chocolate bar I unwrapped, later on. How the idiot was putting these inside sealed products was beyond me but at this point I decided to play along, maybe it was some kind of TV show thing.
""how?"" was all I wrote for my reply. I remember exactly where I put it, because it was the last thing I wrote for a long time. I put it in a crack between my length mirror, and it's wooden backing. As soon as I let go it slid out of sight and I didn't see any papers again for a year and a half.
Getting dressed one morning for work, I went into my room and adjusted my tie and shirt in my mirror, the same one, only it was now on the opposite side of my room. Looking into it, I noticed a square behind me on the wall. Turning around, there was none. In the instant before I turned around again I thought it must have fallen off, but in the mirror it was still there, still suck to the wall. I touched my mirror thinking maybe it was some sort of warping or optical illusion, but it wasn't.
I lifted my heavy mirror up from the ground and slowly walked backwards with it, nearing myself to the opposite wall on which the paper was stuck. The closer I got, the clearer the message on it became, until I stopped, sandwiched between the heavy mirror and the wall, looking at the paper immediately over my shoulder: ""MAKE YOU 2D"" it said.

I moved the fuck out of that house as soon as I could. After bunking at my girlfriend's for a while, I got the fuck rid of the mirror, the toaster, everything. My heart still skips a beat when I see any perfectly square piece of paper, sitting on the floor, all alone. I still live in fear of some day I'll open up a book or look in the inner lining of a jacket, and a piece of paper will flop out.

I check all my things, now. Constantly. I also don't drink coffee anymore.

56,The Missing Man,1276394173,"This is a long entry about a really creepy dream I had during Sophomore year of college following a mushroom trip. It still gives me chills.. 

The dream starts off outside of what seems like a picturesque 1950's 'ballroom' type party in a large mansion. I arrive in the backseat of a very nice car which looks to be straight out of an old movie. The valet guy is fumbling someone's keys as he angrily directs the flood of cars which have created quite the log-jam in the loop driveway. The mansion is in the middle of the woods, adding an ominous tone to its grandeur.  I am here alone, I have no guest, no wingman, no real reason to be attending this party yet I feel completely compelled to be here. I make my way past the doorman and am greeted by a blindingly well-light ballroom. There is dancing and drinking, cigarette smoke and beautiful women all over the place. I feel like I am at home, like this is exactly where I need to be at this exact time.

The dream carries on and I feel like i've been observing this party for hours. Getting sick of being a wallflower, I spot a familiar looking girl and approach her. We begin to talk and I make a verbal note of how attractive she is and how much she reminds me of someone. She smiles and nods confirming my sentiments. Her smile is pearly-white, wide and beautiful...stunning in every sense imaginable. We order drinks and  hit it off. One thing leads to another and we decide to head up to a room to get the real party started.  

I am following her through long hallways and up long sets of stairs when all of the sudden my vision starts to go blurry. I stop and lean against the wall of the hallway as I feel an intense pain shoot through my legs and up my body. It gathers and accumulates around my temples. It feels like I have pounds of water pressed into my head, viciously beating around with every movement. The pressure against my eyes is unbearable. The girl notices my clear discomfort and turns back to see if I'm alright. I'm taken by her genuine concern and conjure up my best spartan impersonation to try to pass it off..after all, shes really hot and god forbid she sees how much of a pussy I am. 

She grabs my hand and we hastily continue down this never-ending hallway. Shes quickly increasing her pace and soon we are briskly jogging down the corridor. 

“Almost there” she says as she grips my hand tighter. 

It is here where I start to notice that things are falling out of place. She's jogging in front of me, basically dragging my dumb ass along when I notice that her head is starting to gaze upward. 

Imagine this; very slowly her head tilts backwards... to the point where she is almost able to look back at me as we're running. Her head then sags slowly to her side (like a person falling asleep in a movie theater) before she 'catches' herself and re-erects her posture. 

Also, her hand is getting really slippery. We are jogging so a little perspiration is to be expected but this has crossed the line into bizarre as our clasped hands are starting to literally drip a fleshy colored liquid which absolutely reeks of stench. 

We finally reach her room. Room 327. She turns to me with a smile on her face as she reaches for her key. She doesn't look so hot anymore. She looks worn, deep red circles of irritation burn under her eyes. Her smile is crooked and gappy, her teeth are a tinged yellow color. She unlocks the door with noticeably bonier hands than I recall her having throughout the night. The door slowly swings open into a room of pure blackness. The light from the hallway offers no visual aid as I try to assess the room. 
She pulls me in and at this point I'm feeling very uneasy about the situation. She tells me to shut the door in a raspy, aged voice. I catch one last glimpse of her grinning, grotesque face before the blackness of the room envelops me. 

The woman is bleeding out of her nose, motioning her receded lips in a disturbing 'slurping' manner. She is making a 'death-rattle' noise with her throat, gurgling and gasping for air. Something is really wrong here. The room is black and I can barely make out the shape of her dress as it appears to fall right off her body.

“Its been a while since we've come here” she says excitedly in a sickening voice. She grabs my hips and I feel a horrible burning sensation where her hands are touching me. I black out. 

I am awakened by drops of water on my forehead. Recalling the events of the evening I shoot wildly to my feet. I am immediately unnerved by my surroundings. 

It is night-time and it appears that I have been sleeping in the middle of the woods. Was this all a dream? I notice a charred foundation of what appears to be a small room around me. Completely panicked and confused I rush through the woods dodging old burnt out frames of cars which look to be from the 1950s. There are various pieces of destroyed furniture strewn about the burnt wreckage which, from the layers of moss growing on them, I can easily deduce has been sitting in these woods for years. 

I somehow navigate my way through the woods back to my house. It is early morning and still very dark out. I throw myself through the front door. I check the calender; July 22, 2008. I must have been sleepwalking... what an awful dream.

The house is completely silent except for the unnerving hum of an electronic device. I am led to the culprit by the dim light coming from the living room. The television is on, illuminating the dark room with a grainy mess of dancing black and white specks. There is a woman sitting in an armchair in front of the set. She is unresponsive to my calls so I approach her and hastily spin the chair around. Its the woman from the party. She is wearing large sunglasses. She looks beautiful again. I try to speak but I cannot form any words. I cannot make sense of what is happening. She smiles her beautiful teeth and giggles at my overtly vulnerable state, removing her sunglasses. Her eyes are missing. In their place are two dark, charred, eye sockets which appear to be producing small amounts of smoke.  

“Sweetie, you promised you'd come home this time!” she laughs. “We've all been waiting so long for you. I promise it didn't hurt too bad for too long.. and none of us are upset with you!”

I gasp, unable to breathe, unable to think. I run to the bathroom to throw water on my face. I turn on the light and rush to the mirror. I am greeted by the gaze of an old wrinkled man in the mirror. I am covered in soot. 

On the counter is an old musty newspaper article from 1948 headlined; “Fire erupts during ballroom party, 326 confirmed dead. 1 man missing.” I read on; “missing man suspected of intentionally starting the deadly inferno which claimed the lives of more than 300 people” 

tl;dr- I sleep hallucinate an elaborate reconstruction of a murder I committed 60 years ago. The spirits of the people I killed (particularly my wife) have been trying to take me with them ever since. ",nosleep,avery16,/r/nosleep/comments/ceer1/the_missing_man/

59,The Gray Lady,1276305653,"I snap awake. 

Something's not right.

Did someone break in again? I'm generally a pretty light sleeper so my dog and I have been assigned to the room at the top of the stairs where we can act as sentries. I look over to the side of the bed to see if my dog had heard anything. That's when I realize that I can't move.

I begin panting in fear. I try each of my limbs in turn but it's as if someone has wrapped heavy chains around them. I attempt a sit-up but that's also impossible. I strain my neck muscles for a long time and finally manage to flop my head to the side.

Fido's not there.

As I lay there panting I realize what woke me up: I can't hear anything. I can't hear the fish tank downstairs nor any street noises nor the creaks of the house. Not even my own breathing. Everything is completely silent but not peaceful. It's as if something has stolen all the sound in the world.

I try to call out to my dog. I feel my vocal cords working but there is no sound. Fido does not come.

There's something on the stairs.

I focus all my attention on the stairs.

There is a shape on the top landing. It's a gray haze - about the size of a melon with two slightly darker hollows where eyes would be. There are absolutely no other features - no mouth, no nose, no hair - nothing. But I know three things about it: it's female, it's evil and it's smiling. Something is standing on the landing just 5 stairs and the width of a narrow hallway from me. I can't move or make noise. I am completely helpless. And she's smiling.

I begin to panic and fight to move. I lose track of her as I concentrate on my arms . It's just for a split second but when I look back she's closer. She's now standing halfway up the 5 steps. Watching and smiling. I can see more of her but it's just more indistinct, vaguely human shaped, haze.

I'm torn between keeping watch on her and trying to move. On the one hand, she only seems to approach when I'm not watching. On the other hand, if I can't move, I can't defend myself. I try to shift my arm while keeping an eye on her but lose sight of her again.

Now she's at the top of the stairs. One body length away from me.

I try again and she's at the foot of the bed.

I am absolutely terrified and stare directly at her so she can't move. At first this amuses her but as I continue to stare she gets angry. I don't know how she manages to convey emotion without any features beyond two smudges for eyes but I can tell she's pissed. I struggle to maintain eye contact. I'm fighting for my life now.

I blink.

She's on my legs and is grinning at me in triumph. She's going to make me pay.

She starts to advance slowly up the length of my body. She's taking her time. Enjoying her victory. Like a snake swallowing it's prey feet-first. I completely freak out and try to struggle but I'm still paralyzed.

She gets heavier as she travels up my body. By the time she reaches my pelvis, I feel as if my bones are going to break from her weight. When she gets to my stomach I begin to have trouble breathing.

She reaches my chest and lies there to gaze directly at my face. By this time I am completely unable to breathe. All I can do is lie there and look back helplessly. She's watching me suffocate. And she's still smiling.

Suddenly she's gone and the sounds are back. I roll over and gasp for breath. No more sleep for me tonight!

66,The Children's Room,1275657207,"During college a few years back I worked for my uncle, Jim*, as an electrician's helper during summers back home in Maine. We were a crew of 14 guys who would meet every morning in an electrician's supply shop before heading out to our respective jobs. 



I had been assigned to work with Peter*, a rather rotund guy who had been working for my uncle for about a decade, at an old mansion built around the start of the 20th century. This place was huge. Three stories, big architectural footprint, giant hedges and expansive grounds -- the works. However, the house had sat vacant for quite some time and was now in a state of decay. That's why we were there in the first place; the house's new owners contracted us to rework the electrical system.



On this overcast day, Peter and I were working on the master bedroom suite on the second floor, redoing lighting systems, which involved us having to get into the ceiling to run cables. At one point Peter asked me to go up to the crawlspace on the third floor to help pull some cables for him. The carpenters in the room overheard him, and started joking around to watch out for ghosts up there and I hadn't been up there yet, so I figured it'd be creepy. I braced myself for anything, and ascended the stairs. 



It was a bit creepy, but it wasn't hyperventilation-inducing shit-your-pants-and-run scary, as I'd expected from the carpenter's comments. The entire floor was broken up into two rooms, a small bedroom or study, and a massive children's play-room. The children's room was easily 40 feet by 20 feet if not larger, and the ceilings were slanted from the roof. The vertical section of the walls was the worst part, though. All the way around the room was a mural consisting of various Disney characters. Not just Mickey, Donald, Pluto, and their ilk, but characters from the various movies; Alice in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, to name a few. They were clearly painted from memory since none of them were spot-on accurate. They were good enough to be able to tell who each one was, but there was just something off about each one. One eye was bigger than another, a leg was slightly longer than it should have been, some were just generally proportionally incorrect. Once I had taken a moment to absorb the details of the mural, I remember getting a chill down my spine. And of course, the crawl space I needed to get to was at the far end of the room from where I had entered. 



I made my way to the crawl space, checking over my shoulder and shining my flashlight everywhere I looked until I finally finished pulling the cable to where it needed to go, and I headed back downstairs. When I got there I said to the carpenters ""My pants are clean, so no ghost."" We all had a good chuckle, talked about the creepy mural for a while, and got back to work. 



Several uneventful hours later the carpenters and other crews had left, with Peter and I still working in the master bedroom, the only remaining people in the house. Because I know you'll ask why we were the only ones left, it's because we did four 10-hour days a week, where the other crews did five eight-hour days. Anyway, we were silently pulling cables, listening to the wind rustling the tree outside, just trying to finish out the day when I heard a cry from somewhere: A baby's cry. Apparently Peter heard it too, because he stopped pulling. We both looked at each other and Peter said to me ""No fucking way. That was the wind, right?""



""Don't fuck with me, dude. That was definitely the wind,"" I said, but I didn't really believe that either. We just kept looking at each other for a second, then Peter shrugged at me with a ""meh, whatever"" kind of look on his face, and we continued pulling. 



We finished the run, and had about 15 minutes left in the day, so we started cleaning up the room. We were both far too tired to be chit-chatting, and both a little tense from earlier. Then we heard it again.



It wasn't faint like before -- it was loud. Really fucking loud. It was so loud that I could clearly tell it was coming from above us now, from the children's room. We didn't look at each other, we didn't even fucking speak. We just dropped whatever it was that we were holding, and we high-tailed it out of there. We bolted down the long hall to the stairs, raced down them, continued running all the way to his van, and just left. It wasn't until later that I realized Peter must have been scared shitless, because he FLEW out of that house at speeds unbeknownst to his massive frame. It wasn't until we hit the main road that we started talking about that cry.



""You heard that, too, right?"" Peter asked me. 



""I think so. Was that a fucking baby?"" 



""Yeah. That's definitely what it was."" We continued driving, neither of us looking anywhere but ahead of us on the road. ""I'm asking Jim to work somewhere else tomorrow."" 



And that was it. We didn't say another word until he dropped me off at home. 




Unrelated to my story, but worth mentioning:  In the basement there was a built-in safe, with a massive steel door about eight feet high, with the interior covered in the same material as the door. Because it was old and slightly beat-up like the rest of the place, it was pretty freaky. None of this story takes place here, but something interesting did happen here to someone else who worked for my uncle.

72,The place between asleep and awake.,1275577331,"Last night I couldn't sleep, I was sort of having tetris-style waking dreams that come from playing too much gameboy before bedtime.  I get the illusion that unless I finish the level of picross (that is in my head), I can't fall asleep.  But of course the level is unwinnable, but I am running to every corner of the board looking for places to fill in blocks while the other side of the board falls into chaos again.  This happens pretty often, sometimes after a day of coding I think that my body is an array and it is becoming unzipped as the numbers making it up scroll down before my eyes.   If the numbers don't converge to the desired pattern, I won't fall asleep, and it starts over from the top.  This can go on for an hour at a time, and I never seem to be able to figure out a way to escape it. 

Last night I was trying to beat the feeling by waking up fully.  I needed to calm my brain down before I could fall asleep with the awareness that I am a human body in a bed and not trapped in some electronic landscape.  I sat up, and was suddenly aware of a presence to my immediate left, even though there is only a wall to that side of the bed.  It was a large headed bald human with dark blue irises that took up a lot more space in the eyeball than they should have.  His skin was completely white but had the texture of a plucked chicken. I looked again, more awake now, and of course he wasn't there but I still felt that he was somewhere nearby.  It was really hard to shake the feeling of his presence, even when I turned on the light and sat up for a few minutes.  When I rolled over to try to sleep again, the puzzle hallucination was back but I eventually fell into a restless sleep.  Although the game-dreams are frustrating, I now think they are an attempt by my brain to distract me from the darker creations of my tired subconscious.",nosleep,ana_ryx,/r/nosleep/comments/cb1o6/the_place_between_asleep_and_awake/

74,The Guy in the Tree,1275525049,"Here's my creepy story contribution:

When I was a sophomore in college, I lived on the ground floor of one of the dormitories. I lived with another girl, Kim, who was the quiet, shy type. I am a very light sleeper, which means that I wake up a couple times at night, and I need to get up and do something before I can fall back asleep. 

Like a lot of college kids, I took up smoking that year. When I would wake up, I would go outside for a smoke, then go back to bed. Several times when I would get up and go outside, I would forget my building key, and have to call my room to wake Kim up so she could let me back into the building (I was a terrible roommate, but that's another story). After a while, Kim told me to smoke out our dorm room window, so I wouldn't have to go out the front entrance of the building.

Our window faced the back side of the building. The school was in Western Massachusetts (UMass-Amherst), so the back of the building was mostly woods. We had one small tree that was directly outside our window that was lit up by a streetlight. 

One night, I wake up, open our window, and start to smoke a cigarette. After a second or two, I notice that there is a young guy in the tree. UMass is a huge party school, so I just thought it was some drunk kid climbing the tree. He was close enough that I could make out his hair color (blond) and his clothing (a blue/gray sweater and jeans). His back was turned towards me, and it looked like he was staring at the woods. 

I kept watching him, and after about a minute, he drops. It took me a second to register that he didn't just fall out of the tree, but that he had hanged himself. Not to get too graphic, but when he had fell, I saw his neck snap back and had heard the the sound of the branches rattling.  I sat there stunned for a few minutes, staring at this dead body, making sure it had actually happened. After this, I freaked out, and woke Kim up, telling her that there was a guy who had just hanged himself in the tree outside. She gets up and goes to the window to look, and says there is nothing there. Incredulously, I run back to the window, and sure enough, there is no one there. 

To this day I have no rational explanation for it. I couldn't have been dreaming, because I had been up for several minutes before it happened. I also wasn't on any substances that could have made me hallucinate. It was well-lit and close enough that I couldn't have just mistaken another object for a person. Finally, he couldn't have been cut down in the time between when it first happened and when I had woken Kim up.

Needless to say, we slept with the blinds closed for the rest of the semester.

tldr; I witness a kid hang himself in the tree outside my dorm room window. When my roommate goes to check it out, there was no one there.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/catxz/the_guy_in_the_tree/

76,Passing through the old place,1275521638,"This happened a few months ago, a little after Christmas. My friends were home for winter break. Everyone back in the same old town again.  Good times had been had, but today was a chill day, and me and my dear friend Evelyn were relaxing in the den, half-watching a movie (Blow, if I remember correctly), half-sleeping. 

At some point Evelyn got up to get a juice, and when she came back it had been quiet for quite a while, so in an attempt to start a conversation she piped up, ""I didn't know your brother was home.""

Lazily, I turned my head to reply, ""Dan's not home, last I checked.""

Evelyn shrugged. ""Must've just got here. I was talking to him in the kitchen.""

My brother, who lived about an hour and a half away, had a habit of dropping in unexpectedly, so I didn't think anything of it. I asked Evelyn what he was up to and she told me he was just ""passing through the old place.""

""Man, I haven't seen Dan in years. He's got a weird smile.""

""He's a weird dude,"" I clarified. 

I was falling asleep about 20 minutes later when I realized Evelyn seemed kind of restless, so I struggled to get off the sofa to fetch some greenery and surprise her. I passed through the kitchen on the way, which has a pretty decent view of the driveway and roadside, fully expecting to see Dan's pimped out supra looking ridiculous as always. 

It wasn't there. 

I hadn't heard any doors open or that engine roar. But then, I had been half asleep. I brushed it off and went up to my room. As soon as my hand touched the doorknob, I heard a *thunk*, and walked in to find a family photo on the floor. My pack of Camels had somehow ended up in the trashbin. I called for my cat, but he didn't show himself. I looked everywhere anyone could hide but that damn cat was too sneaky for me. 

Back in the den, Evelyn said, ""Dan told me to tell you to quit smoking.""

*What?* ""Dan smokes too. And his car isn't here. Where is he?""

""He just went out that way."" She nodded to the door I'd just come through. ""Just a few seconds before you came in."" Suddenly Evelyn seemed to get the sense that something wasn't right. ""You should've seen him… What color are Dan's eyes?""

All the blood had drained from my face. I was dreading what was coming. ""Green."" 

If I had looked scared at that point, it was nothing compared to the expressed on Evelyn's face. ""Oh my god,"" she breathed. 

Without another second, we booked it out of that house. Dan's car was nowhere around; the description Evelyn gave me didn't quite match up with that of my brother. The man she talked to in the kitchen had blue eyes, she said. So pale and translucent they stood out against his tan, which is why she had taken note of them.  We called the police and I called Dan, as unnecessary as it was at that point. He hadn't been home in a week. The police found nothing out of place besides that photo and the pack of cigs. We don't know what happened, and Evelyn doesn't like to talk about it.

78,My first house,1275463072,"*This is a pretty long story of the scariest thing that ever happened to me in my life, I hope you guys never have an experience as bad as mine.*

I recently moved into a new house and now live alone. The house is near a small town, maybe 2 miles away. The house itself in the middle of a nicely wooded area in a smaller town, which is perfect for me, I love the serenity of the woods, being untainted by urban life. The idea of having a barn thrilled me, with all of the possibilities of what I could turn it into.

My parents recently gave me this house as a graduation gift. The house was given to them by my grandparents, which is strange because we didn't live in this house growing up. In fact, my parents never mentioned it to me until I graduated college, admitting that they much preferred the city life over living in the middle of nowhere. My mother lived in the house briefly until she was around 7, when my grandparents decided to pack up and move one day. They never sold the house, they said there were too many memories and at the very least my parents could use it as a vacation home. They never did. 

The house was in a slight state of disrepair, however I couldn't care less. I was a homeowner! Mowing the lawn and clearing the branches was the easy part, the real work began within the house. Dusting old furniture, clearing cobwebs and throwing away old canned food. It took me about 2 weeks of cleaning until I decided it was sanitary enough to move into.

I decided to take a few weeks to just relax, I was tired of partying and I didn't want to start searching for a job just yet. I spent my first day at the house hiking near the creek, fishing on a small pond and meeting folks in town. That night however I was restless, there was no tv and I didn't have any books other than text books. I needed something to do after it got dark out, so I started exploring the house. In the attic to my surprise was filled with random furniture, toys and trinkets from my mothers childhood. I found baseballs cards, jump ropes, a little football helmet, action figures, a doll house, board games, ect. This was fascinating to me. I then found an antique dresser, which I found my mothers diary. Jackpot! I can read this at night until I fall asleep.

Not this night however, I was tired and decided to go to sleep in my new bedroom in my beautiful new house. Sleep came fast, however I was woken by creaking from the stairs and attic. This was to be expected living in an old house, I was sure I'd get used to it. The next day I decided to check out the barn, I'd decided to turn it into a hobby lounge where I could do woodworking or whatever my wavering enthusiasms desired. The barn was in fact in pristine condition, aside from a pile of cigarette butts in the corner and a musky smell which hung in the air. The smell was the only thing that bothered me, I am a nonsmoker I hate cigarettes, the stench they give off makes me want to vomit. There was a very unstable looking ladder leading up to the loft, which I decided not to use, the last thing I needed was to break my neck in the middle of nowhere. There didn't appear to be anything up there aside from some hay creeping over the edge. After picking up the butts, I realized that I had more free time than I planned, since I assumed I would spend the day cleaning the barn.

I decided to explore the attic more, as I could not find my car keys to drive to town. Oddly enough I swore that I left them on the kitchen table next to my wallet, as this is what I have always done with any set of car keys I own. Asides from an old mirror and a pile of old cloths, I couldn't find anything of much interest. As I left I noticed that there were less dolls than I had remembered, and I could swear one of them was not there before. Whatever, I decided to just read my mothers diary.

Lying in my bed I read through the diary, laughing at the entries of the diary. Several of them mentioned her older brother ""James"" throwing tantrums for no apparent reason, punching himself in the face or trying to fling his baseball bat into a tree. My mother must have had a very overactive imagination as a child, she had no siblings and grew up a single child.

I marked the page I was on and went downstairs to get a snack, growing more annoyed by the constant creaking in the attic. I decided to go to town the next morning and find someone who could fix it. Remembering I had lost my keys, I decided to retrace my steps so I could leave for town early in the morning. 

The sun was beginning to set, a dull orange peaking over the horizon, so I decided to check the barn before it became to dark to see. I brought a flashlight just in case it did become too dark. I couldn't find my keys, however I did find a few cigarette butts in the corner which I had apparently missed from earlier. I set down the flashlight and scooped them up and threw them away. After an unsuccessful search, I glanced up towards the loft and noticed there was a doll propped up against the wall. I could have sworn the doll was in the attic yesterday, so against my better judgment I climbed the rickety ladder to the loft. There was nothing up here aside from from an old hammer, the doll and a pile of hay. I picked up the doll and climbed down and walked towards my house. When I entered the front door I noticed my keys on the ground, only the car ignition key was mangled and bent. 

Annoyed that I somehow must have stepped on the key to bend it, I decided to go to bed and walk to town in the morning. Before going to sleep I cracked open my mothers old diary to read. She was surprisingly articulate for a 7 year old, and I became so entranced by the story that the old house's creaking no longer bothered me. 

The diary's entries became disturbing however. ""James"" began cutting himself in front of the family and starting fires, the story was becoming very morbid for a 7 year old's imagination. The most disturbing entry, James had tried to kill my grandfather with a knife and ran off into the woods after stabbing him, my mother bearing witness to the entire scene. After returning from the hospital, James had not returned. Dead animals started appearing outside the front door and messages were being written on the house with blood. She wrote how her grandparents have been whispering among themselves for a week now and no longer allowing her out of the house alone. She also frequently wrote how much she missed James. The diary ended here, with no mention of when or why they moved, it just stopped.

My heart was racing, my pupils dilated and my heavy breathing silent. I didn't want to stay here anymore, true or not the diary chilled me to the bone. I was aware of everything due to my adrenaline rush, the wind blowing outside and every little creak the house made. Wait, the house was no longer creaking, it was dead silent. I pushed my bed against the door barricading myself in the room. I moved my dresser in front of the window, knocking over my lamp and only light source. The blanket of darkness covered the room, the only source of light coming from the tiny keyhole in the door. Determined to stay awake until sunrise, I sat with my back against the wall next to the bed. The floor began creaking down the hallway, stopping right outside my door and then stopping. The light seeping in through the keyhole went dark, I tried to listen over the deafening sound of air entering and exiting my lungs, what was worse was my the constant thumping of blood entering and leaving my heart. A few minutes after soul crushing fear, light returned through the keyhole followed by more creaking. I refused to look through the keyhole to confirm my worst fear.

After what seemed like days, morning finally came. When light creeped around my dresser blocking the window, I moved it and waited until sunlight saturated the whole forest. Cautiously I moved my bed and bolted down the stairs outside. I didn't need a car, I was going to run to town. I ran into the barn to quickly grab my heavy mag flashlight as a blunt weapon if I needed it. I plucked it from the pile of cigarettes it was hiding under and ran down the dirt path into town. I called my parents to come and pick me up from a greasy spoon diner, making sure to sit in a booth which was against a wall and not a window.

**Aftermath**: I did call the police who insisted they found nothing out of the ordinary and both my mother and grandparents deny any existence of a family member named James. I returned to the house, with several friends and my parents mind you, to retrieve my belongings, I was not living in this damned house. There were blank pages from the diary stacked nicely on the nightstand, however we couldn't find the diary no matter how much we searched. My mother vehemently denied ever having one and scolded me for smoking in the barn and littering the ground with cigarette butts and having such an ""active imagination"".

79,"Nosleep, I just had a paranormal experience in a theater today.",1275452738,"I'm doing props for a show at Dobama Theater in Cleveland, Ohio. They moved to a new location this season. It used to be a YMCA, but it closed in 1999 when a 3-year-old child drowned in the pool. A new building has been built around it and turned into an activity annex of the library across the street. The theater its self is where the pool used to be- they built a floor over it, and you can still hear the resonance of the empty pool below the floor when you jump. It's been entirely repainted, except for a part of the control booth where the original swimming pool paint job is intact. There have been jokes about blown-out lights being caused by the ghost, but no one's had a sighting- until now.

Above the theater is an empty gymnasium, perfectly preserved for ten years. There are still gymnastic rings hanging from the ceiling at arm's height. It's used as a prop storage area, but is largely empty. The floor is covered with dust, and you can see where people have been walking. The lights aren't hooked up, and the only source of light is from the stairwell that was built on the outside of the original building. I was in the gym looking for props, when I heard wind whistling from a corner of the gym. I go over to look, and there's an open door to a room with the HVAC system in it. I see a ladder I really, really want as a prop under the pipes. I go to grab it, and put my hand on the HVAC pipe as a duck under them.

That's when I realize something was not right. There's no vibration from any of the HVAC system, and no evidence of any activity at all from the control panel. The wind howling gets louder, and I realize it's coming from a corner behind the equipment. I check to see if there's a hole in the side of the building or somesuch. I shine my flashlight in the corner, and it's just cinder blocks. At that very moment, I hear a muffled splash, as if from below, and a split second later- a blood curdling scream comes from the theater downstairs. I high-tail it out of there, telling myself that I was running to see if someone had hurt themselves downstairs.

I get down there. The only person on that floor is the scene master, who a) is a man, and would not scream like that, and b) was working on a table saw.

They don't need to be brilliant, just something different, whether real experience or made up (from reading these, the best stories are the ones where you don't specify if they are ""real"").*

*I'm not a very good writer, but I'll go first anyway. Pre-emptive apology for spelling, grammar, and tense mistakes.*

One night after seeing a movie with friends, I was on the train back home. It was a midnight train, so it was almost empty, but brightly lit and I had my ipod for music, so everything was fine. 

I get off the train at my stop, it's around 1am now and balls-retreatingly cold. Near the station there are the usual drunk and/or drugged up teens stumbling around, so I briskly walk away to avoid them. The walk back home from the station takes about half an hour, and I had never done it this late at night before, but I figured it would be no different than during day.

I zip up my jacket and begin the usual path home, cutting across the park since it's quicker. The noise of the drunk teens has faded, and now it is completely silent, except for the sound of the wind and my music.

I live in the country side, so it is very dark. There are only a couple of lights along the parks path, there is no moon out, and I have terrible night vision. The sky is clear though, and the stars are brilliant. I keep stumbling because I continually crane my neck upwards to stare at the night sky.

After getting bored of stargazing, I pick up the pace a bit, wanting to get out of the increasingly creepy dark park. I reach a bit of the park where it curves around some houses as a quick way to my home street. None of the houses lights are on, and the path looks like a tunnel of darkness. I tell myself ""fuck that"", and take a different path. It leads to a different street, which in turn connects to my home street, it's just a longer route.

It's dead quiet, none of the houses have lights on, and because it's a rural town the street lights are few and far between. I am starting to get a little scared now, jumping at leaves moving in the breeze, so I walk even faster.

I finally reach the road that leads to my house, which is on the other side of a steep hill. Just at the base of the hill is a round-about with a single street lamp in it's centre. From then on, all the way up the hill and beyond, it is pitch black. I realise that clouds have moved over head, so I didn't even have the starlight. I mentally kick myself for not seeing this coming, and spend a couple minutes debating if it was worth calling my parents to pick me up. I decide against this, of course, as it would mean waking them, which would then wake my brother, who would proceed to torment me forever about being afraid of the dark.

So, I steel my nerves, pull out my earphones so I can hear more clearly around me (since I couldn't see I wanted my other senses clear), then take a manly breath, and bolt up the hill running like a little girl (I am not ashamed to admit this).

It takes a good few minutes to get up the hill, and all the while I am breathing heavily and straining my neck looking all around into the nothingness that surrounded me. I swear there were moving shapes in the darkness, but tell myself (probably correctly) that they were just the trees on either side of the road. The wind starts blowing more, the chill cutting through me even though I am heating up from my pansy running. I am seriously freaking out, over nothing.

Then suddenly, as I near the top of the hill, the wind becomes warm. Not hot, but pleasant, just the right warmth for my already heated body. I reach the top of the hill and start to see light from the street lamp at the base of the other side of the hill. It's in my eyes, so I decide to look back, and instantly regret it. The darkness of the hill stretches out below me, and in the distance I see a tiny pinprick of light from the first lamp. The wind is still warm, and no longer pleasant, I start to feel uncomfortably hot.

I turn away from the darkness, and directly in front of me is a shadow, vaguely human. My heart nearly stops, then I blink and it's gone. I tell myself it's a trick of the light, then also realise that the wind was freezing again, and that I felt cold all over. 

The lamps on either side of the hill seemed much dimmer, so I bolted down the hill and didn't stop till I reached my house. I open the door and a black shape darts between my legs. I swear/scream for a split second before realising it was just my cat going inside. Deciding my heart can't take any more of this, I go to bed, with the lights on.

My friends went on a vacation where they were sleeping in a two story youth hostel in the middle of wood. They were the only people there at the time. One night they made a barbeque in front of the house (there was a fireplace there). Suddenly they realized that in one of the windows in the second story, a light was burning. It flickered and looked like the light from a candle. My friends were looking for the light in the house but couldn't find it. The next morning it was out again. They told the landlord about it the next day (it was the last day of their vacation). The landlord identified the window as belonging to a small closet. The odd thing was, it was locked as long as he could remember, and he didn't have a key for it.",nosleep,Citizen80,/r/nosleep/comments/c2ppb/the_light_in_the_window/

86,EEP,1272309458,"I have mentioned before that strange and/or creepy things seem to happen around my daughter.  There was a request that I elaborate on this.  First, here’s a little background.  She’s nine months old.  She almost never cries.  She’s very intelligent for her age and already has quite a vocabulary.  She figured out how to open the baby gate by the time she was eight months old (I’ve known grown adults that couldn’t get this thing open).  She was born exactly one year to the day after her grandfather (my husband’s father) passed away.  She has her grandfather’s eyes.  She’s probably the happiest, most expressive child I’ve ever seen.  I’m not just saying that because she’s mine.  Everyone who meets her tells me the same thing.  One person put it perfectly.  She said, “If your daughter was in a room with a thousand other babies that all looked the same, she’d still stand out.  There’s just something special about her.”  All of that said, there are some odd things that have happened with her.

Here are a couple of examples.  They are not necessarily scary.  Just strange.

The first time she really freaked me out was right before I put her to bed one night.  I usually turn off her main light, turn on the night light, and hang out with her in her bedroom floor for a few minutes before putting her in the crib.  It calms her down and she goes to sleep more easily.  On this particular night, I ran through the usual routine and sat in the floor with her.  Usually, she’ll crawl over and sit in my lap.  This time, she went past me, lay down, and stared at the wall.  At first, I thought she was staring at the night light (Hey, it’s bright, it’s shiny.  I get it).  Then, I noticed she was looking more to the side, at her window.  She just stared for several minutes, not moving, not blinking.  I started to get really creeped out.  I looked out the window, but I didn’t see anything.  I snapped my fingers in front of her face and said her name, but she didn’t respond.  For a horrifying second, I thought she had stopped breathing.  I picked her up and said her name louder several times and she finally snapped out of it.

Recently, she’s taken to pointing at and talking to the air conditioning vent in the ceiling of her room.  She always looks happy about talking to it.  Every time she does it, the hairs stand up on the back of my neck.  I always expect there to be something watching us.  Since she has started doing this, the baby monitor has been a little wacky.  I keep the receiver right by my bed, just in case she needs me during the night.  Lately, it will emit random beeps and bursts of static.  This only happens when my daughter is in her room.  Sometimes, the static sounds like it has a cadence, a rhythm.  Almost like a speech pattern.  The last time this happened, I went to check on my daughter.  I thought maybe she was moving around, talking to herself, and the receiver was just picking it up in an odd way.  She was sound asleep.  Her blanket was still in the same spot.  She hadn’t moved.

One more fun little factoid:  Her initials are EEP.

87,Theater hauntings,1272307736,"I'm a theater tech major at a university in Ohio, and I was wondering if any of you had any good stories of theater hauntings? I'll go first. Our theater building was built in 1898 and functioned as a YMCA for five years or so before the university bought it. The actual theater was added in 1930, and the old Y functions as classrooms and the building lobby. Our department chair, Cathy, who's been around for quite some time, told us ghost stories about a friendly but timid apparition appearing in the light booth. She had seen it a few times late at night, but it disappeared a few years ago when an old patron and former professor at the university died. Cathy's theory was that the ghost was her husband, a tech professor, waiting to ender the afterlife until his wife joined him. There had never been any paranormal experiences in the theater until this year.

I was sound designing a show, and typically worked late in one of the classrooms on the ground floor, alone in the building. I would hear creaking noises and occasional footsteps from above, but never really thought much of it. It was an old building, and I thought it was just settling. One night I had wanted to test out a cue I had built. It was really loud and obnoxious. I went up to the booth and turned on all the amps to the right level so that I wouldn't burn them out but would get maximum volume. Typically this is loud enough to be heard from outside the building- especially the bass. I plug in my computer and rig it so that I can trigger it from my phone. I go down into the house and hit ""go!"" and the cue starts. I can't hear anything above the sound. When the cue ends, there was this THUMP THUMP THUMP from all around me. It wasn't metallic; it sounded like someone was taking a sack of wheat and banging it against a piece of plywood. It was coming from the back of the stage, a side stairwell the leads to the costume and scene shops, and from the booth. They weren't synchronized. I heard footsteps coming up the main stairs, and I kinda freaked out. Looking for rational explanations, I thought a cop might have heard the noise and wondered who the fuck was playing loud music in a theater at 1 AM on a Friday night, and came to check it out.  I called out ""I'm a student! I'm allowed to be here!"" No reply. The thumping got louder. I realized what happened. A shock ran through me, I was frozen in my tracks. I shouted ""It's alright! I didn't mean to startle you! I don't want to hurt you!"" No reply. I figured I needed to get out of there, but I couldn't move. I called out ""I'll leave you!"" The footsteps stopped. The thumping quieted, but still continued. I ran up to the booth, grabbed my laptop, turned off the amps, and ran down the stairs and out of the building. I didn't turn any of the lights off; typically the lights are off when people leave the building at night. I look over my shoulder once I'm a safe distance away. The lights in the lobby flickered and went out.

There have been other sightings since. I also have a friend who claims to be psychic, and refuses to go into the booth or a professor's office (which is right next to the booth). Another sound designer had a problem with the amps turning on and off randomly while he was working alone in the booth. A stage manager stayed after rehearsal to finish some homework; he saw two flats (fake theatrical walls) and a ladder onstage start to shake. The worst was when I was working alone on a ladder late at night. There were two other people in the building, but they had taken a coffee break and were down in the lobby. I felt the ladder shake, as if someone had bumped it with their foot. I was startled. On impulse, I look down to see if someone had bumped it. All I saw was an ephemeral white wisp pass under the ladder and disappear.

So, any of you have any good stories about haunted theaters?",nosleep,erebus,/r/nosleep/comments/bwcuj/theater_hauntings/
88,Jumping out of my skin,1272302093,"This subreddit has got me so jumpy lately.

My 9-month old daughter has taken to pointing at and talking to my air conditioning vent.  Every time she does it, I whirl around, expecting to see some creepy thing watching us.  Also, the baby monitor I have has been doing some sort of crazy, static thing recently.  Sometimes I expect it to say something.  In fact, I have a LOT of unsettling stories involving my daughter.

Another unrelated event. I was staying at a hotel over the weekend.  There was a large mirror in the room.  I woke up in the middle of the night and noticed a weird reflection in the mirror.  It was probably nothing.  Just the curtains or something like that.  But I was afraid to look too closely, just in case. 

I refuse to look out of a window at night now.  There's a part of me that is convinced something will be looking back.

My cat disappeared too.  My brain automatically jumps to something sinister.  It's terrible.

I guess there's a small, irrational part of me that thinks maybe there really are evil and/or supernatural things out there.

93,Respect for the dead,1272195130,"Out of respect for those who have passed on, our mother forbade us from playing in the cemetery across the street.  Children have no concept of ""respect the dead"".  Respect comes once you have learned to appreciate something, or fear it.  If I had been a little older, I might have listened to her.  I wish I had.

My younger brother Charlie had Down syndrome.  As young as I was, my mother still expected me to look out for him.  My dad left us shortly after Charlie was born, leaving my mom to raise the two of us alone.  The house we lived in was far enough from town that I rarely had a chance to play with other kids my age.  Our closest neighbor was almost a mile in either direction, so most of the time it was just me and Charlie.

Charlie was in the higher IQ range for his disability, so most of the time it never crossed my mind.  He did have some bad episodes though.  If he got mad enough, he would hurt himself.  Mostly just punches to the legs, arms, maybe to his face if he was really mad.  He was never alone, so one of us always stopped him before he could do any real damage to himself.

For Charlie and I, the allure of the cemetery was the large mounds of dirt near the edge of the surrounding woods.  They were like huge sandboxes to us.  Charlie knew enough not to tell mom if she asked where we had been playing.  It never occurred to me to wonder where those piles of dirt came from.  When a grave is dug, and a coffin placed within, some of the earth remains.  Our ""sandboxes"" were the displaced earth of a souls' final resting place.

One Saturday afternoon we were playing in our favorite spot, knowing that my mother was working behind the house where she couldn't see us.  Charlie had been digging for short time when I heard him start to chuckle.  I stopped what I was doing to see what was so funny.  At first it looked like a twisted tree branch, but after brushing the dirt off I could see it was something far more interesting.  Charlie had unearthed a human jawbone.  It was relatively small, most likely it had belonged to a child close to our age.

Charlie quickly snatched it away from me, insisting it was his ""treasure"" and I couldn't touch it.  If I had any sense I would have immediately thought to call the police, or at least tell my mother (of course the latter would have been guaranteed self-incrimination).  Just then I heard my mother calling to us.  Before I had time to think of what to do next, Charlie shoved the bone into his coat pocket, and we darted back through the woods.

We reached the house quickly enough that my mother didn't think to ask where we'd been.  As we went inside Charlie took his coat off and hung it in the hallway.  While he wasn't looking I hastily slipped my hand into the coat and tucked the bone into my pants pocket.  Charlie realized then what he had forgotten in his coat.  He was furious.  He dug through every pocked, shook it as hard as he could, and searched every inch of the floor between him and the door.  He screamed ""My treasure!  Where is my treasure!"".  My mother glared at me, but I swore I had no idea what he was talking about.  I quickly ducked away to my room and hid the jaw underneath my bed.

For the rest of the evening Charlie was completely distraught.  He paced back and forth in our front hallway, mumbling to himself and fidgeting with his hands.  My mother and I made several attempts to get him to calm down, but nothing could get through to him.  After six hours he had completely exhausted himself and fell asleep in the corner by the door.  My mother carried him into our room and tucked us in.

The next morning I didn't wake up until almost 9:30AM, which was strange.  Charlie was always up by 8:00AM to watch cartoons with me.  I got up and looked in his bed, he wasn't there.  Being careful not to wake my mother, I searched all over the house, there was no sign of him.  Then I remembered the events of the previous night.  Suddenly I knew where I had to look.

I had to find him before my mother woke up.  I passed his coat still hanging by the door on my way outside.  Once I was out of earshot of the house I started calling his name.  As I approached the edge of the cemetery I felt a wave of relief, I could make out his figure lying down on the side one of the dirt mounds, I ran towards him.  He must have fallen asleep there, how long had he been outside?  I called his name even louder now, nothing.  Something wasn't right, his clothes were different now.  Darker, somehow.  I slowed down to catch my breath.   His motionless form came into view, but his face, what was wrong with his face?

I fell to my knees, my eyes widened, air pushed from my lungs like I had been kicked in the chest.  Charlie's clothes were soaked in blood, his face unrecognizable from the nose down.  The bottom half of his face wasn't there.  I struggled to comprehend the horrifying scene before me.  I couldn't scream, couldn't turn and run, I was completely stunned.  Darkness enveloped my field of vision as I collapsed to the ground.

Although the pathologist who performed the autopsy strongly doubted Charlie's physical ability to tear his own jaw from his skull, his death was officially ruled a suicide.  The fact that his jaw was never recovered was attributed to an animal most likely making a meal of his remains.",nosleep,xumbi,/r/nosleep/comments/bvt3y/respect_for_the_dead/

95,Does anyone have creepy story relating to sleep paralysis/hallucination?,1272124119,"I'm intrigued by sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming and nightmares. I used to have sleep paralysis almost *every single night* during 9th grade. It went on for maybe a year just after my mom died. I only had a couple of hallucinations though, like imagining clothes for a ghostly figure and things like that.

Other people who have sleep paralysis have the creepiest hallucinations. Do you have that kind of experience?

Also, as I haven't had any sleep paralysis for a long time I kind of missed it. I tried some experiment similar to [Ganzfeld Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzfeld_experiment) and it was pretty nice. I'd lay still on my bed in total darkness, stare at the dark ceiling for a long time and I would slip into a kind of dream where I'm fully aware that it's a dream. Also, my eyes are open the whole time and I can stop the dream whenever I want. Unfortunately, with this experiment I've never had any scary dream. Now I'd like to hear other people do a similar experiment and listen to their story. I'm a fairly skeptical person so I think that's why my ""dreams"" are never creepy. When I'm having a hallucination where I got scared by a shadow, I would ultimately decide the shadow is just some things in my room, not fun at all.

TLDR: Do an experiment similar to Ganzfeld experiment and share your story if anything creepy happens, also if you've had a creepy hallucination while sleep paralyzing I'd love to hear it.

**EDIT:** From my experience, I've had sleep paralysis a number of times when I ""accidently"" sleep while I'm very tired. If you've never had sleep paralysis before, you might experience it when your body is physically tired or under stress and fell asleep (you're not trying in the first place, or you do. I had one SP when I ""woke up"" in the middle of my sleep) on your back. Think of your body going to sleep because of the stress but your mind doesn't want to sleep yet or wake up in the middle of your sleep.",nosleep,c_megalodon,/r/nosleep/comments/bvkch/does_anyone_have_creepy_story_relating_to_sleep/

2,Insanity and Me,1272036925,"I used to live very close to a hospital which closed years ago and is now a housing estate.  The mental unit at the hospital remained open for 2 years after the main hospital moved and stood abandoned for 2 years after its closure.

I had explored it a bit with friends before, somebody had kicked in a fire exit which was the only entrance to the building and it was riddled with locked doors making it difficult to navigate from one end to the other.  One night I went inside just to get cover from the rain to roll a smoke when the security door decided to blow shut, locking me in.

In order to reach another fire exit I had to cross the building which involved going up and down stairs constantly to get around other security doors.  The building was extremely dark, empty, with dust hanging in the air and the remains of curtains blowing gently in the draughts from cracked windows, it was quiet.  I told my friends to meet me at the other end rather than kicking the door in as I like to preserve abandonments and feel that vandalism detracts from the character of the building.  Happily smoking my freshly rolled cigarette I began the walk through the first floor towards the stairs, all I could hear was the sound of my boots crunching on fallen ceiling debris.  I went up the stairs in almost pitch blackness, there were no windows, the echoing of my footfalls was bringing dust down from the ceiling.  As I reached the top floor and began walking towards the next set of stairs I thought I heard a faint whispering ahead.  Since there were no other ways in I chalked it up to the wind, nobody else can be here, I was alone.

As I continued towards the stairs the whispering got louder and I reevaluated my assumption of being alone, figuring that some kids had got in I decided to scare the crap out of them.  I crept towards the room that the noise was coming from, slowly, silently, hardly breathing I put on a manic grin and made the scariest face I could muster then slowly, very slowly peeked my head around the door...

Emptiness, nothing but an old bed and a wardrobe, weird.  A sudden thought struck me, what if they heard me coming and hid in the wardrobe?  Putting on my evil face again I opened the wardrobe to be faced with... Nothing, again.

Disappointed and a little weirded out I left the building, I heard more whispers but no way could a person have evaded me, I ignored it, reaching another fire exit and finally leaving for the fresh air.

It's a housing estate now, but I really miss that place, that wonderful, creepy, oppressive place that gave me so much fun (scaring vandals)",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/bv65k/insanity_and_me/

6,This pitch dark tunnel went for over a mile before we turned back.,1271995029,"In the spirit of machinefist's post, another tunnel exploration.

We entered the tunnel and sloshed through ankle deep water with slimy algae blooms for 30 feet or so before it dried up and turned into a dry black brick walkway. As I was traversing the thick water my foot dropped into a deep section of missing brick and my heart skipped a beat, thinking it was a vertical tunnel. There was eventually a massive iron door, possibly of dwarven construction, blocking the first fork. We decided it best just to continue straight lest we lose our way. There were a number of rusted up remains of ladders to the surface, blocked with manholes, one of them datemarked 1908. After a while we could see no light at all, which was an unusual experience - usually there is a tiny speck somewhere or a dim aura after your eyes adjust, but this was gloriously abyssal. It started to get difficult to breathe, the air being stale and of a strange taste so we put our kerchiefs over our mouths. Approaching the first mile into the tunnel we started to hear the rush of water. We feared a flash flood but continued onward cautiously. Eventually we came to a larger room of sorts with a sizable river crossing the tunnel that was being loudly swallowed by a hole in the ground. The sound was the weirdest, neatest sound ever. We had no way to safely cross this area and turned back.

22,Weird shit while on a Yowie hunt (aka Bigfoot),1271851793,"Not sure if this is the ideal place for this story but I'll go for it anyway. In the late 90's I went on a ""Yowie hunt"" with a group of cryptozoologists in the Blue Mountains (just west of Sydney, Australia). The Yowie is the Australian version of bigfoot, yeti, etc. I was just an undergrad anthropology student who had stumbled across this group online, ended up corresponding with the organiser, and decided to tag along. I'm a skeptic by nature and kinda wanted to see whether these guys were just crackpots.

For anyone who's not been there, it's very mountainous terrain covered in thick bush, just a maze of canyons, ridges, cliffs, creeks, waterfalls, etc. A few of the places we went are only accessibly by foot. Absolutely spectacular though.

Anyway, we spent about 3 days up there, there was a Canadian film crew from the Discovery Channel there as well making a documentary about these crypto guys. I haven't seen the documentary but I'm told my car is in the background of most shots ;-) Anyway, in the time I was up there I saw some weird shit....

*a tree about as thick as my thigh that had been woven between other trees, like lattice (I still have a photo somewhere). Not broken, just... woven.

*A giant footprint in some sand. I wear size 12 boots (Australian sizes), and my foot fit comfortably within it.

*There was one guy who was kind of ""hosting"" the cryptos, claiming he saw the Yowie all the time and had even been leaving food out for it. He claimed that he had set a sound-activated tape recorder under the food bowl one day. The tape contained some footsteps, some rustling, obvious chewing of food, and then more rustling as the covering layers are obviously removed from the recorder, and a massive bang. He claimed he found the food bucket smashed to pieces after this.

*Pretty well everyone in this guy's road claimed to have seen this thing as well. One lady claimed it even came into her house and stole some baby clothes (baby clothes? what the hell does a Yowie want with baby clothes?). The only guy who wouldn't say he'd seen it had just bulldozed a 30m perimeter around his house (this is in thick bush turned into scorched earth stuff), put bars on all the ground floor windows and installed (to my count) 22 motion-activated floodlights around his house. The place was a fortress. He was right at the end of the road, closest to the bush.

*Several people told us that the NSW police had just finished a stakeout in the area looking for something after a number of people had phoned in terrified sightings. Always wondered if there is some form of FOI process I could go through to confirm this.

*After the first night a tree near where we were staying had been demolished, I mean absolutely smashed. This tree was one of those ones that forks out into a double-trunk just above the ground, one half of it was just torn to shreds, and it was a thick tree. Just huge scraps of wood everywhere. It had been OK the day before, the other trunk was untouched.

*One night out in the mountains, I was walking back to my car a few hundred metres from the campsite by myself (I'm a skeptic remember, nothing to be afraid of), suddenly everything goes quiet. I mean crickets stop chirping kind of thing. The most irrational terror came over me, I could barely walk and was shaking terribly, I stumbled to my car, got in and got the fuck out of there. I was supposed to go back to the campsite but every instinct was just screaming at me to GET AWAY. Never been that scared. When I told the guy who was hosting us up there, he said he had a similar reaction when he had seen the Yowie and had shit himself in terror.

*Big chunks taken out of trees everywhere. Hundreds. The locals called them tree-bites, the story is the Yowie listens for grubs under the bark and finding them, bites a huge chunk of wood out to get them. These things were sometimes 2-3 metres off the ground, and each had two parallel gouges along the edges that could conceivably have been big canine teeth.

*One night camping on a ridge, in the middle of the night we hear a CRASH in the bush below us, enough to wake several us, then a THUMP THUMP THUMP like an elephant running, all the while with crashing like a bulldozer was going through the bush. In the morning, there is this path of destruction just torn through the bush in a straight line... small trees broken, bushes flattened. Imagine taking a 1m-wide bulldozer and just roaring through thick bushland. I should say I've heard kangaroos crashing through the bush before, and tree kangaroos dropping down from high perches (they kinda just smash through the foliage on their way down) and this was different.

Anyway that's my story, make of it what you will. I'm still a skeptic, and I don't believe in Yowies, but alot of this stuff still freaks me out even now because I can't find good rational explanations. I've also heard numerous Yowie stories since.

23,My creepiest memory.,1271849688,"I had a terrifying (what I now consider to be hallucinogenic) experience when I was about twelve or so.  

I woke up in the middle of the night, and felt hungry, lonely, and not the least bit sleepy.  First thing's first - go downstairs and have a little piece of pie. I did so, and it was yummy.  Hazah.  Then I figured I would crawl in bed with my parents, so I moseyed into their room.  

As soon as I entered the room, the floor shifted.  It bent away from the door, and I slid and then stumbled into the middle of the room.  I heard an odd sound, like bits of paper dragging along all the walls and ceiling accompanied by a low, viscera-shaking growl. It wasn't dark by any means, the streetlight and hall light kept the room, but it took me a moment to focus on what was happening purely from the disorientation of having the floor heaving under me.  I glanced around, and saw the source of the noise: the hanging spider plant that was always near the window had overtaken the entire room, crawled along walls the ceiling, and was creeping down towards my parents - as they sleep peacefully.  

The floor shifted again, and I turned to see the mirror on the hutch.  I couldn't quite see over the dresser .. my head just barely peeks over the edge.  Except it wasn't my face I was seeing - it was my brother's.  I saw behind me on the bed two dogs that I didn't recognize standing on my parents bed, baring huge teeth and growling up at the encroaching tendrils of plant and shadow.  I could hear them, but only see them in the mirror.  I looked back at the bed, and then the mirror.  At this point I lost my shit because I had had plenty of time already to wake up from this nightmare -- the initial wave of shock and confusion was wearing off.  I remember distinctly saying ""No..."" as it dawned on me that I was actually experiencing this ... whatever the fuck was happening.

I have to wake my parents!  

I move around the edge of the bed, difficult because the floor is now starting to lean the other way.  I crawl in above their pillows and start yelling in their ears. Then something hit me (I heard the *thud* on my skull) and that's all I remember.  

I woke the next morning in my own bed, with the sound of my parents yelling at my brother down the hall, scolding him for getting pie crumbs in their bed.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/bu25p/my_creepiest_memory/
24,Herbert,1271828095,"Originally I had not planned to introduce this subject because my ""incidents"" with Herbert have begun to finally slow down (seemingly from not thinking/talking about him).  But I feel like /r/NoSleep could use a few more recent stories about my childhood imaginary friend and his constant presence.  

The original introduction of Herbert can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bth9m/anyone_here_felt_like_they_were_being_followed_by/c0ohfah).

I have always kept a journal throughout my life (starting around 7 or 8 years of age) as a way to keep my memories to look back on in the future.  These journals are mostly filled with things like ""today I went fishing and caught a huge carp"" from my younger years or ""last night I got so wasted I pissed in a suitcase"" from my trip to South Padre for spring break in college.  There are, however, a few gems about Herbert and how he messes with me that may make for an interesting read.  I am copying these mostly word-for-word out of my journal and only editing to make sense of my poor writing abilities in my younger years.  This is not an entire collection of ""The Herbert Chronicles,"" but some of the stories are too short to be worth posting.  Italicized text in brackets is not in my journal and was added to help explain things.  Enjoy.

**8/02/96 (10 years old) - **
Today Matt and I went down to the creek to check on the beaver's house. There was a lot of rain and we want to make sure it didn't get washed away.  [*The previous entry was all about this beaver dam we found while fishing up stream from the creek*.]  We couldn't find the beavers so we decided to go down further and see if they moved.  I saw Herbert on the other side of the water and told Matt we should try to go across the log that fell down, like a bridge.  When I made it across, Herbert was back on the other side of the water so I told him to come over.  When Matt was on the log, Herbert was trying to get past him and Matt fell in the water.  He wasn't happy about being all wet so we came home.

**3/24/99 (13 years old) -**
I am not happy with my friend right now [*reference to Herbert*].  He always tries to get me into trouble and nobody believes me when I say it wasn't me.  My girlfriend Amber [*next door neighbor girl*] was over today and we were outside on our rollerblades.  I was skating around Amber by my dad's car when I felt Herbert push me.  I was skating really fast and I couldn't stop and I ran into dad's car.  He is still laughing about it but it isn't funny.  He just keeps saying ""they think it was you"" over and over again and he won't leave me alone.  My dad yelled at me for putting a mark on his car but it wasn't my fault.  I think next time Amber and I will go to the park to rollerblade...Herbert never follows us there.

**7/02/05 (19 years old) -**
It has been a while since I have written about him but I have to write this down before I forget.  I SAW HERBERT TODAY.  I know, he isn't real, let it go.  It was the damnedest thing, I was sitting in my room watching tv trying to stay out of the heat when I saw something walk past my window.  I thought maybe it was Matt coming by [*Matt lived in the house behind me for years and we had known each other since we were little*] so I went to the front door to let him in.  Nobody was there when I opened the door though, so I went back to my room.  I must have started dozing off from the bowl when out of nowhere I hear this loud banging on my window...scared me half to death.  I sat up and saw *him* standing there looking in.  I didn't pay attention to him and just kept watching TV.  He kept tapping on the window trying to get my attention so I got up and closed the blinds.  I didn't hear the tapping anymore after that.  I started to get hungry so I decided to take a drive to McD and grab a Big Mac.  I got to my car and I had a flat tire that looked like it had been slashed...I thought this shit was done.

[*There was another entry a few days later about Herbert but all it said was ""Fuckin Herbert, man"" which is what I say to myself whenever something happens around or to me.*]

**4/02/09 (23 years old) -**
Unbelievable.  Today, Stripey [*my cat*] was sitting in the doorway to my room just staring and meowing at something.  I called him over but he wouldn't even acknowledge me.  Finally I decided to get up to see what was so fascinating and what did I see?  Herbert was sitting at my computer playing a game!  I hadn't seen Herbert in years and while it was good to see an old friend, this shit needs to stop!  He just looked over at me with his glazed eyes and shit-eating grin and giggled.  What a creepy little kid.  I told Brittany about it when she got home [*college girlfriend...she believed my stories about Herbert*] from class.  She jested, asking if I said ""hi"" to him and chuckled a bit...I didn't find it amusing.  While we were eating dinner in the living room, we heard a loud crash in the bedroom and all I could think was ""wtf is Herbert up to in there.""  Sure enough, when I went into the bedroom, I saw her box of nail polish all over the floor, bottles cracked and spilled on the new carpet.  She blamed the cat but he was in the kitchen...I knew who had done it.

That was the last entry about Herbert in my journal.  I feel like a notebook is missing though since the last date in that one (on the bottom of the back of the last page) is 12/31/09 and I usually start a new notebook every year.  The first date on my current one is 1/05/10 so either I lost a notebook or I didn't write anything.  The other day though, Herbert made a brief appearance.  I didn't write it down but I could have sworn I saw him when I pulled into the driveway after work...but it was dark so I can't be certain.  One important thing I should mention about my dear friend Herbert is that he doesn't age.  He is perpetually 6 years old, which compounds on the freak out factor when I do see him.  So do any of you have or have any of you had an imaginary friend?

**EDIT** - Specifics about Herbert:

He is of typical stature for a 6 year old. He has semi-long, straight dark hair. He isn't fat but you wouldn't call him skinny. He always has the same clothes on. They look sort of like a dark brown or black suit with a sport coat, button up shirt, slacks, and dress shoes. He has piercing grey eyes, like slabs of granite with tiny little jet black pupils in the center. He is almost always smiling, even when causing trouble (I would say especially when getting into mischief), the kind of off-putting smile though, that seems to grow more to one side of his face in a smirk. When he is angry (which is increasingly rare), he gets this sinister scowl on his face and his brow wrinkles, like a kid that doesn't get his was. But this is different. His eyes go almost jet black and his face seems to hide in shadow. Funny, as I'm typing this up at work I keep hearing a slight noise coming from near or under my desk, but no matter. I have learned that if you ignore him, he pouts but eventually leaves (though not before causing some sort of problem). I will try to find a picture to better show what his face looks like on the internet in a minute here. Update to follow.

[Here](http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g238/heikeott/ricky15.jpg) is almost exactly what he looks like. His eyes are only black when he is angry. He's here now. I can feel him messing with my shoelaces under my desk. I knew talking/thinking about him again was not a good idea but I couldn't help but share.

25,Stories I have heard at sea.,1271817227,"Hey gang,

In my previous post about a 'demon-possessed house and subsequent exorcism' I lived in as a kid, I alluded to the fact that I used to tell this story out at sea when I was bored on watch. As background, I am a warfare officer in the Australian Navy and I drive warships. The easiest way to describe my job is the person who pilots the ship for 4 hour shifts, and when the Captain walks onto the bridge, he often takes control of the ship off me, if he requests it. As such, I often have a team of about 3-4 on the bridge at any one time consisting of a helmsman (who physically drives and controls the engines on my behalf), a more senior 'quarter master' (QM...whose job is to make sure the admin of the bridge happens while i am busy navigating/talking to the operations room) and another junior warfare officer under training to learn my job, if we have a few of them onboard. 'Watches' are 4 hours long, with the usual rotation being 4 hours on, 8 hours off. As such, one of the most bemoaned watch rosters is being the person who gets the afternoon (12-4pm)-graveyard shift (Midnight-4am), also known in Navy slang as the 'Arvo and Guts Watch'. This watch is hated as it gives you the most broken sleep, as everyone onboard normally has to be up and about at 6:45am to start the day. I digress. 

What this means, is that if you are unlucky enough to get the midnight-4am watch, you need to stay awake. Being up on the bridge of a warship, you need to have everything dark so as to not ruin your night vision out the windows and into the sea beyond. 80% of the ship is asleep, and I personally enjoy the quiet 'downtime'. Weird conversations happen, and more often than not, people start talking about weird things that have happened to them. I will never forget the one night I was on a patrol boat in the middle of the Arafura Sea in northern Australia, and the story two of the sailors told me.

A patrol boat is smaller then normal warships, so I only had a helmsman on watch with me. We were hundreds of miles in the middle of the ocean, and were just having a coffee and a laugh while we sat in the dimly red-lit dark of the bridge, the muffled thrum of the ship's engines, the sound of our bow cutting through the dark water and the muted static of our VHF radio scanning empty channels being the only sounds. Every now and then the wind would pick up and you'd hear the howl before it deposited a thin spray of salt water into our bridge windows. Hopefully I have set the scene and made you feel what it is like to be in the middle of nowhere late at night.

One of the senior engineers had wandered up to the bridge for a coffee and he was sitting on the stairs that led up to the upper deck from the bridge, and I had just finished telling my story about our old house to the sailor on the helm, who was a bit freaked out! The helmsman then told me his story....and needless to say, it in turn freaked me out. And I generally like a good 'unexplained story'. His story really re-enforced my wariness of ouija boards/seances, as this was the prime factor behind the weirdness of the afore-mentioned house I lived in as a toddler. His story is as follows....

THE HOSPITAL SEANCE

To begin with, the sailor told me how before joining the Navy, he used to work as a wardsman at the Royal Brisbane Hospital in early 2001. He said it was a great place to work, with other young wardsmen for company, and as he put it 'heaps of hot young nurses.' A few of the girls were into seances and a few of them were living on the hospital grounds in accommodation while they did their internships. One of the girls suggested that one night they go into an abandoned ward and conduct a seance, because as anyone who works in a long-established hospital will tell you, they are normally hotbeds of weird activity. (My mother is a 30 year midwife and she has some things she said she can't explain...like mothers reporting a 'smiling, kindly old matron with a weird hat who came and checked on me in the middle of the night and patted my baby to sleep'...despite there only being 2 young nurses on that shift all night, but I again digress). Thinking it sounded like fun, he said yes, and a few nights later after work, a few of them (plus a few nurses he hadn't met before) all went up to the disused ward and set up the ouija board.

He said they started the seance and the glass started to move as they had 'apparently' contacted a spirit. He scoffed and thought it was a joke, as the glass was moving randomly with everyone putting a finger on it. Of course he thought that the others were moving the glass. He said someone was given a pen and a paper and told to scribe anything that happened. Little did he know that their innocent night was about to get really weird...

Apparently someone asked this spirit, 'What is your name?' The glass moved and spelled out 'N-I-G-E-L.' They all laughed and someone else asked, 'Are you Good or Evil?' (I have goosebumps as I type this) and the glass moved over to 'EVIL.' Still scoffing, the sailor said some other questions were asked, but they got back a lot of jibberish. Suddenly, about 2 mins later he said the glass started going absolutely nuts, and some people started goetting uneasy. Despite this, it seemed to be following a pattern so someone told the guy scribing to write down what the glass was moving to. He got something like the following, and slowly it started making words. Apparently it read, 'I-L-L-B-A-B-Y-C-A-S-S-I-K-I-L-L-B-A-B-Y-C-A.....'
After a few more repetitions the guy scribing went, 
'Kill baby Cassi.....oh, Cassi kill baby? What the hell does that mean??' (I joke you not here when I tell you this, the sailor telling me the story said this screwed/disturbed him for quite a while) One of the girls in the circle turned pale, held her hand to her mouth and ran from the room sobbing hysterically, like a wailing cry of utter terror. He said one of the guys went 'Haha what's up with her?'. 

One of the other nurses went outside to console her, and the story came back as such. The girl who ran outside confessed to the other girl that she had had a secret abortion 3 weeks prior after finding out she was pregnant. She told NO ONE about the abortion, not her parents, not even her own boyfriend. Her name? You guessed it, was Cassie. That pretty much wrapped up the night, and horrified, the rest of them finished the seance and swore never to do it again. 

After he finished telling me this, I was pretty freaked out, but the other older sailor (he was in his 40s) just sat there and said nothing, and drank his coffee. Trying to lighten the mood, I said 'that was a godo story, but what about you Chief (his rank), surely you have a good one you have heard?' I noticed he was looking really uncomfortable so being a great people manager/officer (lol), I decided to go for the jugular and shame him into telling it. 'C'mon chief, tell us!', I jibed. I probably should have left it there, but he decided to tell us. I don't know if it was true or not, but in hindsight, judging how reluctant he was to tell the two of us, and how freaked out he looked when he told us, it's inclined to make me think. I've included it below as I think this pot might run out of room...",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/btvzp/stories_i_have_heard_at_sea/

34,The Grinning Man,1271779519,"This was taking from the wikipedia page of the same name. 


Perhaps the most famous sighting of a Grinning Man is reported to have taken place on October 11, 1966 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The entity was sighted by two boys, James Yanchitis and Marvin Munoz, as they were walking home along Fourth Street and New Jersey Street when they reached a corner parallel to the New Jersey Turnpike. The turnpike is elevated and there is an extremely steep incline going down from the busy street above which leads to Fourth Street. A very large, high wire fence runs along the edge of the other street below where the boys were walking, impeding climbers trying to scale the incline to the turnpike above. There are bright street lights in that area, which gave the boys a good glimpse of what they called ""the strangest guy we've ever seen."" Yanchitis noticed the strange entity first. ""He was standing behind that fence,"" he stated later to investigators. ""I don't know how he got there. He was the biggest man I ever saw.""

""Jimmy nudged me,"" Marvin Munoz reported to police, ""and said, 'Who's that guy standing behind you?' I looked around and there he was... behind that fence. Just standing there. He pivoted around and looked right at us... then he grinned a big old grin.""


There had been recent reported incidents of violence in the nearby neighborhood, such as a middle-resident being chased by a ""tall green man"" down that same street and on the same night, so the boys fled quickly.

Munoz and Yanchitis were interviewed by Keel separately in the home of Mr. George Smythe and both boys told the exact same story. ""The man was over six feet tall, they agreed, and was dressed in a sparkling green coverall costume that shimmered and seemed to reflect the street lights. There was a wide black belt around his waist."" The boys also said ""He had a very dark complexion, and little round eyes...real beady...set far apart."" The most unusual aspect of the encounter is the fact that ""They could not remember seeing any hair, ears, or nose on this figure.""

35,creepy voodoo related thing that happened in my house back in 1998,1271775460,"i just found this subreddit, and i started to read a couple of posts.. there's some really weird and interesting stuff here, so i wanted to share something that happened to me in 1998...

back in the day, we had our computer (the only one in the house at the moment) on our garage... since we didn't had a car then and the house isn't so big, it was a nice place for it... anyway, one night i was playing for the first time a game that turned out to be one of my favorites of all time: ""Gabriel Knight: Sins Of The Fathers"". some of you might be familiar with the game... for the others, it's a point and clicking adventure and, to make a quick explanation, the thing involves you making a research on some creepy voodoo stuff... it all gets really fucked up. go play it.

anyway...  it was late at night, i was playing the game and i reached a part where you find some creepy voodoo drawings on the floor, and a dead bird on it, covered in blood. i figured it was late, i had to go to school on the morning... so i saved the game and went to sleep.

on the morning, i was eating breakfast and my mom tells me 
- hey... did you heard anything outside the garage last night?
- no, why?
- because this morning i saw something really weird... when dad left to work 20 minutes ago, i went outside and i noticed a dead chicken on the garage's door. it was missing it's legs and it was covered in blood... i placed it inside a plastic bag, trashed it and cleaned up the floor... 

i was there, looking at my mom with my eyes wide open, completely still... my mom was like it wasn't a big deal... she just cleaned it up... but i was completely freaked out... for a couple of reasons:
- i live in a city. none of my neighbors keeps chickens on their houses
- while i do not believe in this stuff, someone that DO believe in it actually did this because they wish something bad happen to us. this IS creepy.
- the timing of the chicken appearing right on the garage door where i keep my computer and where i was playing a game involving voodoo where i also found a dead bird as a part of a voodoo ritual the night before that, was incredible.

i'm by no means a religious person, i'm an atheist. i do not believe in magic, sorcery, and that kind of stuff... i chose not to believe in that for obvious reasons that have nothing to do with this... but since i can't prove they don't exist either, i just prefer not to mess with them... i don't like to mess with dark stuff i will never be able to understand...

anyway... my brother was with me when i was playing the game... i woke him up and told him what our mom just saw... he reacted exactly just like me... 

long story short, i still in a shock, uninstalled the game and decided never to play it again...

nothing happened to any of us and some weeks later, after i was out of the shock and convinced myself it was just an incredible weird coincidence, i installed the game again and played through it... nothing happened other than me amazed by the excellent game i just completed.

now seriously. if you haven't played the game, go do it.",nosleep,ferna182,/r/nosleep/comments/btmdg/creepy_voodoo_related_thing_that_happened_in_my/

37,I Think My Fear Of The Basement Is Justifiable,1271750198,"Copypasta from my blog. I had intended this to be sort of funny, but everyone seemed to be creeped out by it.

""First of all, like most basements, it is dark and makes a lot of weird noises and has a lot of places where people (a dwarf?) could hide. But the other thing is this: There are many doors in the front and back of the building that lead directly into the apartments. There is only one door that can be used to gain direct access to the basement. It is around the side, in an unlit gangway, with no locked gate or anything like that to bar access. And the few people in this building who ever use that door rarely lock it.

Imagine you’re a robber, a psycho or a weirdo raper guy who wants to break into this building. The unlit, easily accessible entrance is obviously the way to go. You get in and find that most of the doors into the apartments from the inner stairwell are locked. So you go down to the basement. You hide behind one of the many dark corners, perhaps in plain sight. If it weren’t for the odd lighting; the jumble of boxes and tools; the askew angle of the floor; I might see you straight away. But instead, I don’t notice as you watch me silently. Perhaps for some reason no one but you understands, and which I will never find out, you don’t take this opportunity immediately. You let me take my laundry and move on. You stay down there, occasionally sneaking out at night to eat from our garbage cans. You might hide down there for a month, and I would never know. You are living out some sick fantasy where I am your wife, and you reach out for me from the darkness to touch my hair, only to pull your arm back when I turn around. When I leave, with a wheezing laugh, you pull your cock out from under your tattered rags and masturbate into the drain hole on the ground.

One day, when the time seems right to you, you will step out from the shadows. Confused and unready, I will be able to say nothing to you except “Wait.” Ignoring my meager pleas, you stab me multiple times with my landlord’s garden shears. What you do with my body after I am dead, I will never know.""",nosleep,clintisiceman,/r/nosleep/comments/bth5g/i_think_my_fear_of_the_basement_is_justifiable/

63,Ever been scared shitless in real life?,1271464476,"One night I was at home, stayed up late, and before finally going to bed, I went to the bathroom to have a pee. I didn't switch the lights on because sometimes my cat would have opened the door to my parents' room in the opposite end of the corridor, and it could wake my mother up.

Then it happened. It still gives me the creeps today, as I write this. From the corridor you have direct vision of the entrance door. Next to it there's our video doorbell intercom, which always has a shiny red LED on. As I randomly walked through the corridor, I caught a terrifying glimpse of something that disturbs me to this day. The red LED was gone. Then it quickly popped in again. FUCK. I was paralyzed, because I quickly realized that if that happened, something tall must have been in my line of vision, and I was sure I was the only one awake that day and that late. I'm not scared of ghosts and dead things; I'm scared of the alive things that can do actual harm. I thought we had a burglar.

I must have been pale as shit for a few seconds, just standing there, immobile, looking at the red LED, and it still gives me the creeps when I think back of it. Yet I finally came to the conclusion that I just had something formidable happen to me. I had seen the LED at the corner of my eye, with only one eye, with such bad luck that I noticed it as it passed through my blind spot, my brain filled it with the black surroundings, then it quickly reappeared as I moved. I managed to reproduce this with a blind spot test (looking diagonally at the screen without covering any eye, but in a way that my nose obscures the disappearing object for the other eye), though never again with the small, distant red LED, yet I know it may happen. I can explain what happened (and indeed there was no burglar), but I was horribly scared on that night and just remembering how I felt scares me again.",nosleep,A_for_Anonymous,/r/nosleep/comments/bs2jk/ever_been_scared_shitless_in_real_life/

(Got bored, wrote a kind of creepy story)
Please read and review, If I get enough positive feedback or constructive criticism I may try my hand at another story",1270678348,"You are walking through the hallways of your school during lunch. The hallways are mostly empty as almost everyone else is in class or out getting food but you had a good breakfast, a bagel with cream cheese and a corn muffin, so you are not too hungry. You look around and notice that the hallway you are in is in the newer wing of your school. There is one room to your left about five feet in front of you and another about seven feet beyond that on the right. As you walk past these rooms you let your eyes wander over to the door in the right-hand corner of the hallway and opposite that you notice the stairwell and another classroom around the small bend. 

*What is there to do?*

 As you continue to look around lazily you notice that there are only a few other people in the hallway, getting water from the water fountain, going to the restroom, heading outside for a smoke, but it is not unusual for the kids in your school so you don't think much of it. You decide to walk down the small staircase.

*Nothing better to do, I might as well keep wandering around*

You pass the office and turn toward the stairwell, pausing only slightly to glance at the small sign on the door of the corner room which reads ""Dentistry Office"" as it has for as long as you have gone to this school. You think of making up stories to scare the freshmen with as a joke. Maybe it was used for training torturers and for the final exam the instructors would pick the students who had failed too many classes or forgotten exactly eight homework assignments. 

*It should be eight because the students were taught to only torture someone for eight minutes before finishing them off or some random reason like that*

As you turn left towards the stairwell you make a mental note to start spreading the rumor around later that day. As you imagine the reactions of the students you chuckle to yourself. You reach out and push open the door to the stairwell, quickly retracting your arm as something brushes against it. Looking around, you notice a small purple sticky note lying on the floor with what looks like brownish paint on it. It must have fallen off of the door as you opened it; you were probably too distracted with your story to notice it. Upon closer examination you notice that the paint was made into a vague arrow that is now pointing toward the door.

*It doesn't mean anything, it's just an arrow. Someone probably put it on the door because they were bored*

 Walking down the stairwell you notice a few more purple sticky notes seemingly scattered around the stairs and on the walls in a hurry. Brushing it off as some other student's boredom you keep walking down the stairs. One strange thing that you notice about the notes is that each seems to be more carefully painted and placed than the last. By the time you reach the basement floor the arrows are much clearer and seemingly placed with meticulous precision so that the bottom of the note looks as though it is perfectly parallel with the floor. A glint of light is reflected off of one of the arrows and you notice that the paint is slightly cracked and you can see that it has not completely dried yet.

*Was this one made more recently than the others? Whoever made it sure took a lot of time*

Upon opening the door to the basement hallway and looking around you notice that there is only a single note with an arrow pointing down the steps to the storage room. Drawn by curiosity you walk towards the note and examine it closely. A vaguely familiar, slightly metalic smell hits your nose. You carefully pick the note from the wall. You turn toward the storage room. You've always wondered what was down there. 

*Hell, I might as well try to open it, I've got tons of time before lunch is over*

As you reach for the doorknob to turn it you realize that the smell is coming from the paint on the note. You think nothing of it and turn the knob. The doorknob turns slowly as though it has not been used in a long time. Your heart beats faster. You imagine some treasure trove of salvageables in there, old  cameras that the photograhpy class used, maybe even old computers from before you were born. You push against the door but nothing happens. You push harder and shake the doorknob, but still nothing happens. You decide to throw your whole weight into opening the door. You back up, still holding the doorknob, and throw yourself against the door. The sudden force of hitting the door makes you fall over. As the door creaks open outwards you swear that you hear a faint laugh but realize that it was the creaking of the door.

*Damnit that hurt. Oh, god DAMN it. Why didnt I try to PULL the door before ramming it*

Rubbing your shoulder you walk to the now open door and peek inside. It's too dark to see anything so you pull the door open wider to let more light in. The room itself is not very impressive. Cement walls with names painted on them, a couple of wooden planks, a few broken desks and chairs. The light doesn't reach the entire room, but rather leaves the back wall dark. Slightly let down, you turn away to walk back down the hallway when you see something moving out of the corner of your eye in the far end of the room. You call out but recieve no reply. 

*I know I saw something move. I probably shouldn't go in but c'mon, nothing's gonna happen*

You walk down the steps into the storage room and look around. The metallic smell that the note had seems to be coming from all around the room. The paint on the note and the paint that the names were made with seem to be the same. You reach up to touch one of the names but accidentally drop the note. After managing to catch it mid-fall, you realize that the paint on the note smeared onto your hand. The paint has a slightly thick consistency as you rub it between your fingers. It feels like something you know but you just can't quite place it. With your other hand you reach up and trace your fingers over one of the names. The paint cracks and flakes under your hand and pieces of it fall to the floor. 

*Well that isn't very good paint, it flakes off wherever I touch it*

Suddenly you hear a faint creaking sound. You spin around quickly and see the door closing slowly. As you rush toward the door and reach for the  quickly escaping light you notice that the paint on your hands is not brown but red, a dull, dark red. Your fingertips brush the door just as it clicks shut. Feeling around frantically for the handle you realize there is none. You hear the same faint laugh you heard before and realize that it isnt coming from the creaking door, but from deeper inside the room. Your heart is pounding in your throat as you walk to the back wall. Suddenly you hear a strangely familiar voice.

**Hello**

*It's just my imagination, my mind is fucking with me, that's all*

You shake your head to clear your try to regain your senses. You reach out to the back wall as you walk to it. You can't see your arm but you can feel it shaking. Your eyes slowly adjust to the dark room. Just as your fingertips brush against the cool, smooth surface of the wall you recoil backwards and trip over your own foot. You could have sworn that as you stared at the wall someone, no, some*thing* staring back.

*This can't be happening, I'm the only person in here*

**You are half correct**

You slowly get up and step toward the wall to inspect it. What you see shocks you. There is a person looking right at you. They seem to be covered in paint, most likely from the walls and notes. In one hand they hold a paint brush and a stack of purple sticky notes; in the other hand, a knife and a can of paint. What shocks you is that where there should be a face there is only smooth skin.

*What the fuck, what the fuck is this*

**We needed you. We are so nearly complete**

You notice that the figure is coming into focus as you become more and more faint.

*What the fuck is that thing? Why am I getting tired?I can't sleep, I have to get out of here, I have to get out, have to get out, have to ge...*

**We will, you were the last**

You collapse onto the floor and start convulsing. After a minute you lie still. You stand up but it is as though you are not moving your legs, then you realize that they are not your legs. You try to scream but it is as though your voice has been taken, the voice that speaks is not yours. You see your arm place the paint brush in the bucket, then you realize the arm is not your own. The brush is brought to your mouth by the hand. Your tongue extends and touches the tip of the brush. If you could have you would have recoiled at the ferrous taste of the paint. You see the hand reach up and write something, a single word. Something from your past. Something that you only recently lost. The hand wrote your name. The body walks over to the mirror and what you see terrifies you. It is a person. Not a human, no, but a collection of different parts from many different people. The only thing that is missing is the skin. 

*I am so close to freedom*

I walk over to the wall and look in the mirror. Those that I have taken stare back, each is incomplete. I step back into the mirror awaiting the next victim, searching through the collected memories for a person with the perfect skin. I am so close to being complete. I must thank you for the face and memories. Your friend has such nice, smooth skin. I hope it wouldn't mind coming here. I'd love to meet it. Hadn't it said something about checking out the storage room after school was over? Too bad you can't warn it, don't you think? No you don't, not anymore. I close your eyes and wait. 

*So close to freedom*

The door is opening, your friend is here. Soon, I shall be complete so soon. So soon.
