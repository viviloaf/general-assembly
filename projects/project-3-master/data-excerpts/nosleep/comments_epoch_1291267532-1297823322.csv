Like every other evening I looked out as the sun set on the horizon. The lake was quiet at this time of the year and the falling leaves gave the night a tranquil feeling.  As I went to sleep that night I had a feeling of uneasiness, but was overcome by exhaustion and fell asleep. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fm8p8/lets_write_our_own_story/

The wife works a night shift but hadn't returned yet, I made a note to call her on my way in to the office, she often works extra hours though. As I am turning everything off I reach for the remote and go to hit the power button and mistakenly hit the input button, switching me over to my HMDI 3 input. Now displayed on the screen were the familiar green hues of a night vision camera looking out over a room that looks like just about everyone's basement. In the middle of the room was a woman facing away from the camera and someone standing directly behind her. The person behind the woman turns to look back at the camera and waves. Disregarding it as some scary movie the kids had on the night before I turned the TV off and locked up the house.

I called my wife to see if she was putting in some overtime at work but she didn't answer, being a nurse, this was typical of her. Suddenly the blood in my veins froze, the happiness in my heart died. The woman in the basement looked an awful lot like Liz, and the basement looked like ours too.

8,The field at night,1297798656,"When I was a teenager I worked nights at a local grocery store after school. I would come home at night between 9 and 10 at night. My father lived on some land that was behind my grandmother's house. This land had been farm land and there was still a barn and giant field back behind the place I lived. It wasn't uncommon to hear loud noises at night which were usually the wildlife that surrounded the area. Perhaps one of the most frightening noises that I heard living there was a panther that lived in the surrounding woods. Anyone that has ever heard a panther in person know that it sounds like a female screaming which can rattle a person that is awakened from a peaceful sleep. 
 
There was one such night that I was arriving home when I saw things moving around in the field. It wasn't uncommon for deer to be grazing in the field and usually I could see their faces as they gazed up at my headlights for a few moments before dashing away. On this night, however, the sounds were screams like a panther and I noticed there were eyes reflecting from the ground. Instead of parking my vehicle and going inside, I decided to keep driving back into the field and find out what was going on. 
 
My vehicle edged slowly forward until the eyes reflecting in my headlights could be seen and the head of the animal was in full view. It was a deer, just like all of the others, but it wasn't running away. I put the car in park and stepped out of the vehicle slowly but keeping my body half in - half out. The deer moved his head up and then it fell backwards when I noticed his stomach had been torn out and he was dying. At that moment I heard the loud scream of the panther that lived in the woods. I jumped back in my car and slammed the door shut and swung my head around in the direction that I heard the scream from. All I could make  out was the tall dark silhouette of a figure resembling a woman with long hair running back into the darkness...  
 
After that night, the panther screams would occur more frequently only they were now next to my window.",nosleep,trisight,/r/nosleep/comments/fm0uk/the_field_at_night/
9,"When they come I'll know
",1297795024,"I always have the same feeling right before it happens. I'll lay awake and wait for them. My body feels light and my breathing is irregular as if I am about to start a race. I can feel them thinking about me and I know they are on the way. I try not to fall asleep because I know whats going to happen. I lay awake. I feel myself drifting and I jerk away. I try but I know it's in vein. Finally I succumb and go to sleep.
My body lies stiff and my arms can't move. My eyes dart around the room but I don't want to look. My heart my mind my body debilitated. I know it's happening and that they are here. I listen to the humming buzzing drone that happens every time. Every single time. The harder I try to move the tighter it grasps me. My eyes tear as I look at the ceiling and plead plead plead not remember anything. Please I know you're here but I don't want this, I don't want to remember anything. Please.

My body feels weak as they enter the room. How they enter I'll never know. The door opens without a sound and my family never wakes. The feeling of dread has come to fruition and here they are. They usually number between three and five. The area around them is blurry, I can see light coming through the cracked door but I feel as I am looking through water. They shift and move like the wind. Effortlessly, without energy. I can hear them but there are no words or sounds. Only the feeling of my ear drums moving as if there is heavy bass although the room is completely silent. They know I'm terrified and I know they heard my pleas.

They're talking about me. Debating, I think about how to approach. The buzzing murmur is louder pulsating in my ears as suddenly one is next to my bed. On the right side. Next to my torso. I didn't see it walk up, but I guess you never do. His skin is something I would call chalky and cool, although I have never touched them. He calms me although my hearts still beating rapidly. My brows furrowed and I feel the sweat drying off my body. Not even seconds later but really who knows, I feel stimulated and try to fight the feeling of arousal. I don't know what's happening or why I'm starting to feel this way as I am not being touched. It's absolutely terrifying. I get the understanding that we aren't going anywhere.

Tears are running down my face. I grit my teeth and can only make out a low moan. My fists are shaking. I try to raise my ankles but they feel so weak. A loud snap, and I'm in a bright room. Dried tears and mucus on my face. Time doesn't exist here. You will never know the helplessness I felt. So overwhelming with no choice but to accept. As I become aware of their thoughts they appear in the room. I'm exhausted. This again. I don't want it. My thoughts plea weakly.

They are here for a moment and then leave. I felt their presence but didn't see them. Low hums and high gravity. I feel stuck to the table, although not restrained. I lift from the waist and feel so heavy. My hair, my torso, everything is so heavy. No clothes of my own. Its cold. The skin around my nose feels dry and cracked. I touch my face but it feels numb. My body feels numb. I stand and feel slight vibrations through my feet. I don't feel I should leave the room. I don't know when they will be back. I don't feel them anymore. The walls aren't there, it's just white. Gray and white. No lights but its light. The walls don't glow, they don't feel like walls they just are. I wonder if this is real at all or something they produced. I'm here but I feel the illusion. They're coming back. I've thought too much. I should have behaved.

Four.  They look like what you would expect from tv, but have a blur over them.  I feel by doing this they are protecting me from becoming even more terrified.  I'm defective in some way, reproductively.  They tell me they can't use me.  I wake up in the moment I left in.  It's 3:32 in the morning.  I feel like I'd been gone for hours.  


When I look at myself in the mirrors I get the feeling they are looking at me too.  Like apart of them are behind my eyes watching me.  I don't stare at myself for too long or I'll get a haunting feeling.  As I've written this over the past few days I've been laying awake a lot, also sorry for blocking it in separate posts, it's really hard to write about..  I have never written about this, I have never spoke to anyone about this. I don't want people close to me to think I'm crazy.  I'd be embarrassed by their questions.  I've felt like a different person since those days and am not sure its a bad thing.  ",nosleep,speakskaeps,/r/nosleep/comments/flzhs/when_they_come_ill_know/
10,Walking in the Dark ,1297791963,"I haven’t contributed to /nosleep in a few months, so I decided to write up one of the scariest experiences in my life, inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fjvnr/an_walkingatnight_experience_i_wont_soon_forget/).

Nothing supernatural happened and it was more of a funny teenage experience, but I still find it to be one of the most frightening things that has ever happened to me, and I’ve never felt more ‘connected’ or ‘real’ as I did that night. There’s quite a bit of back story, and I’m not the best writer or story teller, but people seem to have enjoyed my stories in the past!

Getting started…

It was early April, and I was on spring break – grounded. I had been stuck in my room with no computer, no phone, and nothing to do for several days. While my parents were at work I combed the house looking for my phone(no house phone), and found it at the bottom of a large vase in the hall (my mom knew she had to be creative  ).  I immediately called my boyfriend, and we talked for several hours. We eventually decided that we NEEDED to see each other, so we came up with a plan for me to sneak out of the house that night. He and his brother would pick me up at the front of my housing development and take me down to his house, then drop me off back home later in the night.

I was never the kind of kid who’d break the rules, so I spent the rest of the day anxiously going back and forth as to whether I’d go through with my plan or not. That night my mom decided I could have my phone again, but I still felt angry and rebellious, and I still wanted to prove to my boyfriend that I could go through with it and break the rules.

I waited until about 12 for my family to go to bed, and I was finally comfortable to leave. I left through the front door, which was the first exhilarating moment of that night. The anticipation of my parents waking up or some neighbor seeing me run down the street got my heart pumping, but I eventually made it to the front of the development and was picked up. I hung out with my boyfriend until around 3:30 am, and he and his brother dropped me off at the end of the street. 

Walking up to the house, I felt a great sense of accomplishment. I had done something that I’d never expected myself to do. I broke the rules. I quietly pulled open our screen door, and pushed in the handle of the front door. No dice. It was locked. I was screwed. The only option I had was to open the garage door, which would surely wake up Mom and Dad. Plus, the front door was locked, so I figured they KNEW I left.

At this point I had no idea what to do. I decided to try and go over to one of my girl-friend’s  houses, because finding out that I snuck out and spent the night hanging out with one of them would probably be better than finding me at my non-confirmed boyfriend’s place. I repeatedly called their cell phones, but no one picked up. I snuck into two of my friend’s yards and knocked on their windows, but neither answered. I was freaking out, and felt exposed wandering the neighborhood where so many people knew me.

I called my boyfriend and told him what happened. Talking to him, I was only able to come up with one solution – we needed to run away. We were going to collect supplies from his house and live in the woods until things blew over. At this point, his brother was no longer home and couldn’t give me a ride, so I’d have to walk down the infamous Yelm Highway, and meet up with him. [To give you guys an idea, this is approximately the route I had to take to get there.](http://i.imgur.com/56i82.jpg) We’d done the walk before during the day and it took 2 ½ to 3 hours up or down either way. This road was surrounded by trees, and had only a few stoplights along the way. The road was windy, and although it was a ‘highway,’ it wasn’t widely used –especially at night.  It scared the shit out of me.

With my cellphone at about ½ power, I started toward his house. The first 20 minutes or so of my walk were residential, and I felt safe under the street lights. This comfort was soon lost as I slowly went down the highway, into more wooded areas. 

Cars would pass every ten minutes or so. I was afraid that I’d get hit, or some psycho would pick up and kill me. Still, their lights were comforting. My cellphone provided me with a little light, but seemed to quickly run out of power. I figured I’d have to walk for maybe an hour and a half before my boyfriend and I cross paths. As long as I made it that far, I thought I’d be fine.

45 minutes in is when I began to feel my mind deteriorate. I still slept with a nightlight, yet I was walking down this crazy ass dark wooded road, alone, at 4am. All I can say is thank god slender man wasn’t around yet, otherwise I’d probably have curled up into a ball and died.Besides the occasional car, it was totally silent and totally dark. Thoughts were streaming through my head, and I was sure something was going to get me.  I remember singing Bob Marley songs, in a weird attempt to comfort myself. Cars were becoming more and more infrequent, and things around me were not recognizable at all. 

Eventually I go to a bridge (and thought to myself bridge wtf?) because I didn’t remember there being one.  The bridge was short (and I later found out it was an overpass for a train route), and as I was crossing a car came up beside me and slowed down. It was a blue sports car, and a man inside asked me if I needed a ride. This is probably my most vivid memory of the night, because I still can’t remember his face. Anyways, I quickly declined and he drove off.

After he left, another car didn’t come by for at least half an hour. I began to hear coyotes in the woods, and they sounded pretty damn close, I wished I took that ride. I was sure I’d be eaten, but I also knew I had to be close to meeting up with the bf – yet after walking another 45 minutes he was no where in sight. I had no signal, so I couldn’t call him. I wouldn’t be able to call for help if I was attacked, hell I couldn’t even call my parents to pick me up and take me home for punishment.

I forced myself to keep going, but I felt totally alone. I was so used to having someone carefully watching over me, making sure I was safe, making sure that everything was OK. I had abandoned the safety my parents provided and this was my punishment. I was just overwhelmed by the feeling of impending doom. I kept walking, yet no bf, no safety. I didn’t know if I should turn back, and I didn’t know if I should keep going. There had been several forks in the road, so maybe I took a wrong turn. I just kept going.

I eventually got to some road signs which I estimated to be a 20 minute walk to his house. The sense of relief was amazing. I came around the bend, there were flashing lights. The popo.  A police officer approached me. He saw my boyfriend walking down the road and picked him up.  My boyfriend told him he was coming to meet up with me, so he was on his way to find me too. He told me to get in the car, and then he looked up both our names, to make sure we weren’t criminals or runaways. He contacted my boyfriend’s mom and she just said to bring him home. I gave him my mom’s number and she ended up picking me up at Red Wind Casino. 

Coming so close to ‘freedom’ and having it taken away SUCKED. Surprisingly, I didn’t get in much trouble for what I did. I think my mom understood how I felt, and what my motivation was. The rest of the break was uneventful, but I got to keep my phone and the internet was reconnected. Somewhat anticlimactic, but I will never forget that night.

16,My experience last night,1297748556,"I thought this was interesting, and it freaked my girlfriend out, so I thought I'd share it with you guys. 

Last night at about four in the morning, I guess I woke up, but was more in that state where you're sort of between asleep and awake. This state is when you are supposedly most susceptible to the supernatural, which makes me wonder if there was more to this than just a dream that seemed real. Anyway, while in this state, I remember talking to someone. He was lying on the desk across the room, just a silhouette in the dark, but fairly visible. What's really odd is that we were discussing the possibility that there was a ghost in the room with us. I wasn't really concerned with who the hell he was, more on our conversation. He seemed kind of scared, funnily enough, and funnier still, I was not. I remember most notably he said ""There's definitely a presence,"" while gesturing to the corner of the room by my closet. Now, I know someone who is generally sensitive to the paranormal and has noticed something kind of shadow man in my house, near my room in particular, and when this guy mentioned a presence, I looked for this shadowy beast in the corner. He said ""If you look the right way, you can almost see something."" I did so, and started to kind of make out a shape, and told him so, but mentioned ""it's probably my imagination."" He didn't seem convinced. That's most of what I remember. The feeling was really interesting, not scary at all, as I hear sleep paralysis is (not to mention the fact that I wasn't paralyzed), and it didn't feel like just a dream, at least not to me, as my dreams are either ridiculous and silly or absolutely terrifying. The best way to describe last night is it was like staying in a hostel and sharing a room with someone you've never met before. You don't know them, but you make conversation since you're sharing a room. 

I couldn't get it off my mind today so I thought I'd post. Let me know what you think. ",nosleep,SirRosie,/r/nosleep/comments/flnix/my_experience_last_night/

It was just like any other boring saturday. Wake up, go online, shower, watch tv. This day after getting out of the shower, I decided it was time to wash my clothes. When the dryer beeped, I took out the clothes and threw them on. There was nothing exciting about the day, but once in a while I got that strange feeling of being watched. I shut my curtains and closed myself in the bedroom, where I can sit in the bed and see the entire room. I felt much better immediately after closing the door, but when I sat down, I felt something.

It was a piece of lined paper taped to my back, written on in childish handwriting:

24,Where is the most haunted place you've been?,1297711403,"Story 1:
Alright so here is my first of 3 stories, it happened at the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield. Also know as Shawshank Prison, where it was used for most of the shots saved the cell blocks, Air Force One also filmed there.
I am on an airsoft team here in Ohio that hosted some large events at the prison (3) so far. Our last game started at dusk and ran into the night. The first of the small issues were near the start of the game, it was one of the classic occurances, power drain. One of my friends had just bought batteries and placed them in a radio from the package before my eyes, and not even an hour into the game, it was dead, he had spend most of the hour in the back of solitary confinement, one of the places I got chills while walking around the prison.
Another group of friends were going down a cell block clearing all the cells when they saw a shadowy figure half way down the cell block. They checked every cell and found nothing when they got to the end I was at the other end of that cell block and had not seen anyone go by me, not having any way to explain what happened after looking around for any light or person that could have caused a shadow and finding nothing we promptly got our asses out of the area.
Another thing that happened was up in the infirmary, I had gone up alone to prepare for an upcoming scenario, and while up there I heard some distinctive whispering coming from a corner of the room, it was like 2 people were there having a conversation, which of course made me decide to go back downstairs and wait for other people to go back up stairs with me.
So that is one of three stories, expect the other two soon!
If you have anyquestions about the prion itself, feel free to ask, I have been all around that prison and into a lot of places the tours don't go. I have been on the roof to the guard towers, I have been in the basement, and I have learned a lot of neat history from the Restoration Society.",nosleep,the_beast,/r/nosleep/comments/flaor/where_is_the_most_haunted_place_youve_been/
25,Just visiting,1297708084,"I was at my girlfriends grandparents house at the time. We were both college freshman home on break. Needless to say I was very nervous to meet her grandparents as well as her other extended family. It's getting close to bed time and since both our parents were ""old school"" her and I slept in separate rooms. It didn't bother me because I had always tried to be respectful. Anyways, I went downstairs to the spare bedroom. I took out my laptop to listen to some music and plugged in my phone. I was feeling really uneasy. I knew it wasn't the food or something silly like that. I genuinely felt in trouble... and that's when it happened. My phone beeps when you plug in/out and started to go wild. The room dropped at least 10 degrees to the point where I started to see my breath. My computer which was fully charged died. Blacked out. I tried restarting it and reassuring myself that I was just making shit up because I was tired. The phone fell off the dresser and at that point I said out loud ""Fuck it"" and ran upstairs. My girlfriend said I was so distraught I couldn't explain to her what had happened. She did what any awesome girlfriend would do and got blankets and several pillows and I passed out on the couch. Needless to say I never slept downstairs again.

History on the house itself.
They built a modular home and placed on the property in 1988 and was finished in 1990 I believe. The house sits on a good 20+acres in New Hampshire. The house that had been there before was burned down. However, no one was hurt.",nosleep,redtoken,/r/nosleep/comments/fl9dp/just_visiting/
26,A poem to help you through the rest of the winter.  ,1297701088,"The Cremation of Sam McGee	 
by Robert W. Service

There are strange things done in the midnight sun    
By the men who moil for gold;    
The Arctic trails have their secret tales    
That would make your blood run cold;    
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,    
But the queerest they ever did see    
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge    
I cremated Sam McGee    

Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee,    
where the cotton blooms and blows    
Why he left his home in the South to roam    
'round the Pole, God only knows.    
He was always cold but the land of gold    
seemed to hold him like a spell;    
Though he'd often say in his homely way    
that he'd sooner live in Hell.    

On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way    
over the Dawson trail.    
Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold    
it stabbed like a driven nail.    
If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze    
till sometimes we couldn't see,    
It wasn't much fun, but the only one    
to whimper was Sam McGee.    

And that very night, as we lay packed tight    
in our robes beneath the snow,    
And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead    
were dancing heel and toe,    
He turned to me, and ""Cap"", says he,    
""I'll cash in this trip, I guess;    
And if I do, I'm asking that you    
won't refuse my last request.""    

Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no;    
then he says with a sort of moan,    
""It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold    
till I'm chilled clean through to the bone    
Yet 'taint being dead-it's my awful dread    
of the icy grave that pains;    
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair,    
you'll cremate my last remains.    

A pal's last need is a thing to heed,    
so I swore I would not fail;    
And we started on at the streak of dawn    
but God! he looked ghastly pale.    
He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day    
of his home in Tennessee;    
And before nightfall a corpse was all    
that was left of Sam McGee.    

There wasn't a breath in that land of death,    
and I hurried, horror-driven    
With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid,    
because of a promise given;    
It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say.    
""You may tax your brawn and brains,    
But you promised true, and it's up to you    
to cremate these last remains"".    

Now a promise made is a debt unpaid,    
and the trail has its own stern code,    
In the days to come, though my lips were dumb    
in my heart how I cursed that load!    
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight,    
while the huskies, round in a ring,    
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows--    
Oh God, how I loathed the thing!    

And every day that quiet clay    
seemed to heavy and heavier grow;    
And on I went, though the dogs were spent    
and the grub was getting low.    
The trail was bad, and I felt half mad,    
but I swore I would not give in;    
And I'd often sing to the hateful thing,    
and it hearkened with a grin.    

Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge,    
and a derelict there lay;    
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice    
it was called the Alice May,    
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit,    
and I looked at my frozen chum;    
Then ""Here"", said I, with a sudden cry, ""is my    
cre-ma-tor-eum""!    

Some planks I tore from the cabin floor    
and I lit the boiler fire;    
Some coal I found that was lying around,    
and I heaped the fuel higher;    
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared    
such a blaze you seldom see,    
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal,    
and I stuffed in Sam McGee.    

Then I made a hike, for I didn't like    
to hear him sizzle so;    
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled,    
and the wind began to blow,    
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled    
down my cheeks, and I don't know why;    
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak    
went streaking down the sky.    

I do not know how long in the snow    
I wrestled with grisly fear;    
But the stars came out and they danced about    
ere again I ventured near;    
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said,    
""I'll just take a peep inside.    
I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked"".    
Then the door I opened wide.    

And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm,    
in the heart of the furnace roar;    
And he wore a smile you could see a mile,    
and he said, ""Please close that door.    
It's fine in here, but I greatly fear    
you'll let in the cold and storm--    
Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee,    
it's the first time I've been warm"".    

There are strange things done in the midnight sun    
By the men who moil for gold;    
The Arctic trails have their secret tales    
That would make your blood run cold;    
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,    
But the queerest they ever did see    
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge    
I cremated Sam McGee.

27,A guy driving to work.,1297690229,"Gene Phillips, a regular guy, on a regular day, with a regular job..
Nobody knew what was going to happen, nor did he, his wife and 2 kids..
He grabbed his bag, ready to go to work, he gave his wife a kiss, walked out the door and stepped into his car to go to work.

But then on his way to work he notices a guy standing on the side of the road. Even though Gene usually doesn’t pick up hitchhikers, he decided to pick up the guy, for a reason he did not fully understand. The guy looked somewhat neat anyway, cleanshaven face, a proper shirt and jeans.

You coming along? Gene asked. Thanks! The man said in a mellow voice. I have to go to Columbia State. I can take you halfway there, Gene said. He followed up with the question: Where do you have to go anyway? It turned silent in the car, then the man replied in a rash voice, to my mothers’.
Gene took a better look at the guy, and he saw he didn’t look as neat after all, he had small stubbles, a wrinkeld shirt and his jeans were somewhat dirty.

The man asked, so where are you going?Gene said; I’m going to work, I’m from Summit and I have to go to Lexington, I’m an accountant.

It went silent again and then Gene smelled something weird, a filthy penetrating smell which could scare away a skunk with a stuffed nose. Something smelled dead, Gene got scared, He didn’t know what was going on, but something was terribly wrong…

The man looked at Gene, laughed and said, you’re driving very fast aren’t you? Gene looked at his speeder and realised he was unconciously driving 20 miles over the speed limit. Gene put on a fake smile and said; I don’t want to be late for work do I?
I used to do that to back when I still worked, the man said.
Gene raised an eyebrow, this man was 25 at the most, how can he imply he’s that familiar with driving to work?

Suddenly the man turned his head in an unusual way, and Gene looked him directly in the eyes, there was nothing there, no pupils, no irisses, just a big black emptiness. It’s your time to go Gene…  It’s over… You’re dead.
Gene screamed: SHUT UP, IDIOT! He hit the breaks and yelled: I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE, BUT GET THE HELL OUT OF MY CAR! 

There was the sound of cars breaking, and a loud crash.

-This is the 8 pm clock news of Juli the 27th 1999, I’m Diane Hawkings. This morning there was a chain collision on the 20 interstate, a man was driving a considerable amount over the speed limit, and breaked unexpectately, causing multiple other cars to crash into him. The man driving to work died, the whole car was destroyed, except for the front passenger seat, which appeared to be vacant. We can see this on a shot taken by a speed camera, the man also appears to be yelling at someone. Now for the headline today, Hank? Thanks Diane, there are many reports of the rare manganese bird… -

28,So much light.,1297687726,"Hey guys. Long time lurker, first time poster. I read a lot of the stories said here and I enjoyed every single one of them. Beforehand, I would apologize if my english sounds disjointed or confusing at times; it's not my native language.

So anyway.

I've had a very colorful history regarding the supernatural. But I've only felt things. I've never seen something supernatural, as I think my mind would shatter. But there was this one exception. 

I was about 14 at the time, with my mother, in a bus, travelling. It was about 21:00 when the bus started sluggishly descending the steep hill, leaving the small town behind us. The bus had quite a few people inside, but being mostly tired from the three hour ride, it was quiet. As I was sitting on the left side of the bus, overlooking the cliff, from the right side came a blinding flash that encompassed the entire bus. It all happened in the fraction of a second. It was almost as if everything stopped moving and my brain hit my forehead. It came out of nowhere. It was immensly bright and it had a faint blue-ish tint.

And everyone else felt it. People were frozen with fear. No one dared to say anything until the end of the trip, when some of the people broke down in tears. In that tiny ammount of time I felt so scared and terrified that the feeling lingered on for days. In a manner of speaking, something inside me was changed. After that event, my supernatural occurences multiplied. 

Least to say, to this very day, I avoid mirrors at night. I get an overwhelming sense of dread just thinking about it. I feel tempted to cover the mirrors in the apartment before going to bed.

I like to think there's a connection. ",nosleep,apparatus86,/r/nosleep/comments/fl3om/so_much_light/
29,DAE still have vivid nightmares?? i just did....,1297682225,"Part One:

I have nightmares on a regular basis, not terrifying. They are usually of me in my bed paralyzed. i usually end up moving, but its in a dream. so i wake up from that dream and i'm in my bed paralyzed. This goes on and on in layers i even try screaming for help. this started getting worse when i wake up (in real life) and i cant move.after i wake up in real life from these dreams, i never go back to sleep in fear of going through it again.

Part Two:

why i'm awake right now is because i had a nightmare that i'v never had. ( my dreams are always repeats) It seemed so real i feel like it just happened to me. 
It was the middle of the night, and my apartment is dark. my twin brother is in the living room and i went to get his cellphone. I felt my whole body go warm/numb and  i was suddenly was pushed down by some force that i couldn't see. the door to my room slammed shut. i was just kicking and i couldn't got it off.somehow i manged to get the door and run to the living room and i fell on the floor...my brother didn't believe me.
This part isn't scary, it just happened. i woke up form that dream and i was at a family friend's house and trying not to fall asleep cause i'll be in a nightmare again.
i woke up (for real this time) and i couldn't move, so i jolted out of bed. then once i was able to move, i went out to the living room, everything looks the same as it did in the dream and i logged onto reddit...

so here i am typing about my dreams. the only reason i'm scared is because part one happens all the time, and part two was so realistic, everything in my room was in place, the hallway, and the living room was in perfect detail. except my twin isn't on the couch, my other brother is..

30,"The Midnight Game Rules, explained",1297669398,"I see a lot of people on here asking about the Midnight Game, what is it, how do I play it, hey can I do this thing instead, et cetera.

For everyone who is curious, here are the rules - a special annotated version explaining the why and wherefore of various aspects.

Please keep in mind that while this is a modern game, it is based on, and uses many elements of, ancient rituals. It is not to be taken lightly. If you can't or won't play by the rules, you probably shouldn't be playing at all.

* * * * * 
Basic rules copied from http://justmegawatt.com/readables/tutorials/midnightgame

BEFORE YOU START:

Cover or remove as many reflective surfaces as you possibly can from your house. Mirrors and picture frames can be covered with sheets or towels; curtains and windows should be shut; shiny metallic surfaces should be hidden or covered.

Will you need to use the bathroom between 12 midnight and 3:33 a.m.? Be quick, be alert, avoid reflective surfaces.

If you anticipate needing to eat between 12 midnight and 3:33 a.m., set food out beforehand. Avoid metallic containers (including aluminum pop cans), surfaces, and silverware. Eating fresh fruit and veggies and/or a sandwich is best: they require no cooking, they are portable, and they have a high nutritional value.

If you're playing with other people, synchronize your watches.

Turn off all cell phones and all sources of light. Unplug non-essential electronics generating light, such as microwave ovens, coffee machines, entertainment equipment, and other appliances.

DO NOT OPEN ANY APPLIANCES WITH AN INTERNAL LIGHT, SUCH AS THE OVEN OR THE REFRIGERATOR, BETWEEN 12 MIDNIGHT AND 3:33 A.M.

DO NOT USE / TURN ON ANY ELECTRONICS BETWEEN 12 MIDNIGHT AND 3:33 A.M.


YOU WILL NEED: 

New, unused, untouched candles, large enough or in enough quantity to last from 12 midnight to 3:33 a.m. Each player should carry spare candles. Do not touch another person's candles. Do not re-use candles or exchange candles with other players.

Matches. Each player should carry spare matches. YOU CANNOT USE A LIGHTER.

Paper and Pencils.

A wooden front door. This is essential. You may need to find a location other than your home.

Salt. Each player should carry salt with them - not a salt shaker, which merely sprinkles salt, but something enabling the user to POUR salt.

A sharp metal needle or pin. Do not use knives or materials other than metal. Cauterize the tip between uses by holding it in the flame of a candle, wiping it in a clean cloth, and if possible dipping it in peroxide.


Step 1: Everyone who is playing the midnight game must write their names on a piece of paper, then use the needle to place a single drop of their blood onto the paper.

You MUST write your full name - not a nickname, alias, or the name of a friend. Writing your name on the paper and adding your blood makes you a target of the Midnight Man; lying about or hiding your identity increases the risk to you and to your fellow players.

Be aware: giving any entity your name and your blood makes you vulnerable. You are setting yourself up as a sacrifice to the entity you're inviting into your home. Whether or not you believe in magic or the supernatural, performing these actions WILL invite something into your home and WILL give it your name and blood, and you WILL be vulnerable to its influence until 3:33 a.m.


Step 2: Place the paper(s) behind the closed wooden front door.


Step 3: Light a candle. If candles were already lit, light a new one to signal the ""start"" of the official summoning segment.

Because this is the summoning portion, the newly lit candle may be blue, black, or dark purple. It does not HAVE to be colored but a colored candle may lend the ritual power.


Step 4: Knock on your front door exactly 22 times. (Note: The 22nd knock must happen at 12:00 AM or the ritual will not work.)


Step 5: Open your door, blow out the candle, and close it. You have now summoned and welcomed the ""Midnight Man"". Immediately relight your candle.


Step 6: Your goal for the rest of the game is to evade the Midnight Man. 

Everyone who plays must walk with their candle lit around the house, avoiding the Midnight Man at all costs until the clock strikes 3:33 AM. at which time the Midnight Man will leave. 

If your candle blows out on its own, it means the midnight man is near, and you have 10 seconds to relight your candle. 

If you fail to relight the candle in 10 seconds you must surround yourself with a circle of salt and wait until 3:33 AM. Stand in one spot and, holding the container of salt, pour a thick line around yourself while turning. Pouring a circle and then stepping into it will not work.

If you fail to surround yourself with salt in time, the Midnight Man will attack and you will have hallucinations of your worst fears until 3:33 AM.

Signs that the Midnight Man is nearby:

* Your candle blows out
* You suddenly get very cold
* You hear a low whisper
* You see a black humanoid figure within the darkness

Though it is not listed on the basic rules, being touched, brushed up against, or breathed upon are also signs that you have the Midnight Man's attention. KEEP MOVING. Stay in the light of your candle. DO NOT RUN.

WARNING:

* DO NOT USE SOMEONE ELSE'S BLOOD ON YOUR PAPER, because it is deceptive and brings more risk to you and the person whose blood you stole.

* DO NOT STAND IN ONE SPOT UNTIL 3:33 AM, THE MIDNIGHT MAN WILL FIND YOU and you will not have a chance to protect yourself.

* DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FALL ASLEEP DURING THE MIDNIGHT GAME. Falling asleep renders you vulnerable. Even if you are ""safe"" inside the circle of salt, sleeping breaks the rules of the game and makes you an easy target.

* DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE DURING THE MIDNIGHT GAME. Breaking the rules removes what little power you have over the Midnight Man.

* DO NOT USE A LIGHTER OR ANY OTHER LIGHT SOURCE IN PLACE OF A CANDLE.

* DO NOT TRY TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS DURING THE MIDNIGHT GAME. If you're playing with friends, you may want to ensure they can't turn the lights back on by turning off the electricity at the fuse box. Don't do this unless you know what you're doing. Common sense, people.

* AND DEFINITELY DO. NOT. TRY TO PROVOKE THE MIDNIGHT MAN!


The Midnight Man is not interested in physically harming you. He wants to scare you, get inside your head, mess you up. You must prove you're in control by continually moving forward and being alert without being freaked out.

When you lose control or get scared and hide, he has won.

Carrying a weapon during this game could be exceptionally dangerous, especially if you're playing with other people. You can't stab or shoot a spirit. Spirits are vulnerable to metal, so wearing protective jewelry may help. Carrying a weapon is NOT a good idea.

At 3:33 a.m. the Midnight Man will leave your home. Use any remaining lit candles to burn the paper with your name and blood, announcing the Midnight Man has gone / must leave and you are free.

Blow out all candles and throw them out, or allow them to burn down safely. You can turn on the lights and go about your normal business.

The light on my webcam stopped turning on once I started these videos, if it can't turn on, it can't turn off, and I can never turn her off. Today however I was drunk and crying in the video and questioning why God would allow someone like my wife to be murdered a year ago.  The only witness was an old man in the apartments seeing someone in a ski mask fleeing the building, they were never found.  After all my curses I pass out in my bed, I forget to turn off my webcam.  I watch the video later and notice something odd after I pass out.  Someone has come into my room, someone with a ski mask, and a knife.  They walk in like they've been there before and stare at me from the edge of my bed.  Looking at me, then their knife, then me again.  They then turn inquisitive and start glancing around the room and picking objects up and examining my bedroom.

37,"Any strange stories from your place of employment? (Ghosts, strange/messed up customers, or otherwise)",1297657278,"First of all just want to say that I just discovered r/nosleep on friday night and I haven't been able to sleep or allow myself to leave my room to go to the bathroom until it's light out all weekend. I will blame any future bladder problems on you. :P

I love the long threads on here that include a large amount of true stories, and I would love to hear some creepy anecdotes set in your place of employment. I'm not just looking for unexplained things, but also stories about creepy/fucked up instances involving customers or coworkers.

I'll start. This might be long, as I can easily get too descriptive when I write. I'll re-read it and try to cut it down, but sorry in advance just in case.

PERSONAL BACKGROUND:
 I do believe in the paranormal and I have been extremely sensitive to it since I was a kid, just like my grandma. I usually see things where others only feel things, and when I only feel things it's usually effortless for me to identify the energy. I have many stories and thankfully none involve threatening spirits (save the time 4 friends and I were walking around a graveyard at night and my dumbass ex-boyfriend decided to insult the dead people. We pretty much got herded toward the exit by shadow people. Scary shit, but a story for another time) so I accept strange happenings pretty easily and very rarely feel I'm in danger from them.

THE JOB:
I used to work in a movie theater. This movie theater was part of a mall that was built over/around where an old railroad station had been (in the same state as the Golden Spike Memorial so there's definitely lots of history surrounding it). This wasmy first job (I was 17 when I started) and was quickly promoted to team lead. 

MY GHOST BUDDY, FRANK:
 I was the only cleaner with the rank and availability to open the theater so I was regularly on the floor by myself for several hours in the morning until it picked up. The first showings of the day were always pretty empty, but I had to go in and check every row and seat anyway. Most of the seats were on a slope, and one of the rules we had to follow was that we couldn't start cleaning the rows in front of the guests until they left. We could only clean behind people, or the very front few rows that were flat on ground level and therefore not in anyone's direct line of sight. 

Several times I would go in to clean theater 12 (which we were actually told was haunted as newbies. Not even as a hazing thing, just kind of as an ""oh, by the way"" thing) and there would be one person in the very top row in the corner watching the credits in the dark. He was wearing a hat similar to the ones my great uncle has always worn. The kind the rat pack used to wear. I'd be a bit frustrated and clean the front rows, watching the guy in my perpheral vision waiting for signs that he was getting ready to lve, but he wouldn't, so I would go back over by the exit ramp and wait a while. Sometimes I would get frustrated and start cleaning from the bottom of the slope until I was about halfway up and if I went any further I would obstruct the man's view. At this point I would start turning toward him and begin asking if he enjoyed the show, but stop halfway through the sentence as there was no one there.

The first time this happened I had so much adrenaline going through me it physically hurt, but I finished cleaning the theater because I wasn't really scared, just startled, and I could tell he wasn't malicious. 

As it happened more often I just got used it. It continued to trick me every time though. His prescene was strong enough that I never noticed any difference between the times when there actually WAS someone there, which happened to me all day, and when it was this man. Sometimes I would be cleaning the front rows and I would see the last guest get up and start to descend the steps, look up to tell him to have a good night, and no one was there.

This became so frequent that I eventually started saying hello to the man in the hat, telling him to have a good night and generally treating him like a welcome guest; and although I was alone for hours at a time I never really felt like it. He would even sometimes ""follow"" me to theaters 11 an Every once in a while i would attempt to ask him questions, but I never got a response. The energy from him was always friendly though. At some point during an encounter with him the name Frank randomly popped into my head. I've never known anyone named Frank, so I assumed this was the spirit's name and began to use it when I addressed him. If it wasn't his name, he didn't mind.


HAUNTED BATHROOM:
The cleaners were also in charge of cleaning the bathrooms and about every other day in the women's bathroom by theater 12 I would clean 3 out of 4 stalls, then have to wait for the person who was in the 4th stall to exit so I could clean it. I could hear them shuffling and rustling around, and feel for certain there was someone in there. I'd wait for a while, get frustrated, look more closely at the stall and realize it was very sightly ajar. I'd push it open and no one would be there. Although this was also near theater 12, I don't believe it was Frank. It didn't happen in the men's restroom right next to it, and this presence always made me feel a bit uneasy. Still not threatened, but like something just wasn't quite right. I also beleive it was female.

COWORKER'S STORIES
So as I said before, the haunting of theater 12 is kind of a legend cleaners who have worked there for a while tell newbies. Most of the accounts I had heard from other employees had just been along the lines of ""I always get that creepy feeling that I'm being watched and I'm not alone when I'm in there."", which could easily just be the fact that the projectionist can totally look out of his little window at you, but a few had actual stories to tell. 

 THE LITTLE GIRL:
A supervisor of mine and I were discussing the things I had seen and she told me about a time she was working alone at night. She had been in the back hallway where we stored equipment and which we used to get from the hallway housing theaters 10-12 to the one housing theaters 1-6. She had been partway down the hallway, closer to 12 of course, crossing off movies on her schedule that had aready ended. She had the paper up against the wall with her back to the entrance by theater 12. People would often try to exit the theater through this hallway as there were doors to the outside at the end of it, but as they were often caught trying to sneak people in that way we were supposed to direct any wayward guests back toward the main exit. Every once in a while curious or unruly children would wander into the hallway as well. 

Since this happened fairly often my supervisor's first reaction when she heard the distincly loud, clumsy steps of a little girl in little heels coming toward her from theater 12 was to turn around and escort her back to her parents. When the footstes were just about even with her, she turned around to address the little explorer, but there wasn't anyone there. I never saw this little girl spirit, though she may have been the culprit from the bathroom, but my supervisor apparently saw her a few, very rare times.

FRANK TROLLS A TEAM MEMBER:
 A coworker of mine who was a rank below me (team member) would get pretty spooked by the stories we would tell about theater 12, and even though she had been there longer than me she had never experienced more than the creepy being watched feeling. Even so, she would always put up a fight whenever we asked her to clean theater 12 by herself (it usually held less popular movies and even if it was a busy night one person could handle it while the others tackled the messier theaters). Of course this led to us assigning her to theater 12 more often, since it  was pretty funny to watch her squirm. 

One day after she had reluctantly stomped into the theater I started sweeping up in the hallway. About a minute later she tears out of the theater and practically slams into me. She's repeating over and over that she is NOT going back in there. Apparently she had been standing in the wide aisle between the seats at the bottom of the slope and the front, level seats, watching the bloopers. No one was left in the theater. Suddenly she sees one of the front seats recline a bit out of the corner of her eye. She turns to focus on it and it goes back to the upright position, like someone had gotten up out of it. She froze until she heard footsteps coming away from the chair and up the aisle toward her. Then she ran.

I just laughed and said something along the lines of ""Don't worry, it's just Frank, he's cool"", went back in there with her, said hello to Frank and cleaned the theater with her.

TL;DR: Worked in haunted movie theater built over historic train station, made friends with a ghost named Frank, Frank trolled a coworker. Also, possible little girl ghost.",nosleep,alwaystakeabanana,/r/nosleep/comments/fkx1u/any_strange_stories_from_your_place_of_employment/
38,My shadow person,1297656651,"So this is my first time posting in nosleep, and this is a true story that happened to me probably when I was about 12, and this isnt a ""true story"" which just says that cause it feels it should. Me, my brother and my cousins all saw this.

Some background as to me and my cousins, we were all really into ghosts and aliens and all that supernatural stuff at this point in our lives, we looked at pictures of ghosts and aliens and would watch those documentaries on the history channel about aliens a bunch. 

My cousins were sleeping over at my house, and we were staying up watching tv although my parents had said we should go to sleep by 11, it was probably between 12 and 1 at this point. At some point my mom comes down the stairs and she tells us we all need to go to sleep, we say we will and turn the tv off. Now before I continue I'll need to describe my stairs, my house had two stories and we had stairs that went halfway up with the steps facing towards the living room and then they'd turn back and the other half would turn away from the living room, and the staircase was about 5 feet to the left so in the living room you could see almost all the stairs except for the upper quarter.

So after my mom leaves and we sit around in the dark, 10 minutes later we turn the tv on, except now were more cautious, we keep the volume really really low and have someone watch the staircase. Probably 15-20 min later my little brother tells us my moms coming down, we turn the tv off and all lay down thinking she's coming to scold us for not listening, we lay there in the dark for probably a minute when nothing happens. After we get up (I'm gonna switch my narrative to better tell what I remember), I remember looking at the staircase and at the halfway point of my stairs where it turns back is the figure of a person, except all black, but even at night with all the lights turned out, the person is a clear black figure in the dark.

At first I assume the same thing my brother did, that it's my mom whose just standing there for some reason, I don't remember if we all just stared at it or I might have asked it ""Mom?"" but to be honest, I'm not sure. After a few minutes, it doesn't move at all, and then the next idea comes into our heads: its a shadow person. In all our looking into ghosts and stuff, wede seen pictures of shadow people, and now we were scared so obviously the best course of action is to keep staring as I asked my older cousin, ""what do we do?"" ""I don't know, what do you think we should do.""

All the while it just stood there, didn't budge or make a move. My older cousin and I then decide to send my younger cousin into our kitchen to find a flashlight, (because were older and scared, so were going to send the younger ones to do stuff for us). He looks around for about a minute and finds nothing, the rest of us just continue to stare at the shadow person the entire time.

Our next plan, time to walk up and see what it is closely. The one picked for the job, my younger brother. I can remember him kind of crawling around one of the chairs in a pseudo-sneaky fashion, and what happens next I remember more clearly than anything else. The second my brother touched the bottom stair, the shadow person turned and moved up the stairs, but this is thats important, it didn't walk, when you walk theres your movement of legs, and your body shifts position. The shadow person moved at the exact angle of the stairs and its body didn't move at all. When that happened, we all became really scared and immediately threw blankets over ourselves and went to sleep.

The next morning, the first thing I do is ask my parents if they came down to check on us last night. My mom said she came down the one time to tell us to turn off the tv but thats it. When we told them the story of the shadow person, my dad at first told us it was probably my mom, my mom just laughed it off. After we insisited it was a shadow person my dad just laughingly suggested we call George Norey (he was a fan of George).

I don't think I ever saw the shadow person again, and all the bad feelings I've ever gotten from the house I'm pretty sure I can chalk up to plain paranoia, but I know what I saw that night, and it's gonna stay with me.",nosleep,zerut,/r/nosleep/comments/fkwwc/my_shadow_person/

44,Almost every night....,1297633631,"This is a true story. When it happened to me and i thought it was normal but, now that i look back on it, it is pretty creepy.

So, This happened to me in my early childhood about the age of 5. 
I woke up almost every morning and went downstairs without waking my family. I walked into the kitchen to check the time on the microwave, it usually said 3:00 or a few minutes past 3. At this point i would grab a glass of water and go into the living room. I fed the fish for entertainment. This is the part that gets creepy. I would usually start to hear voices, not just one or two. It sounded as if a conference of people were talking all at the same time. it was English but so many voices i couldn't understand what anyone was saying. It was both male and female voices. I went around my house trying to find the source of this noise. First i ran to everyone's rooms to see if they were awake. My brother, my sister, my twin, my mother and father were always fast asleep and i knew no one had any radios in their rooms. I would check the T.V, the radio, and the VHS player but nothing was on or playing. I was 5 years old so i didn't think anything of it.
 After i moved out of that house and across town, the voices stopped but i still experience eerie feelings. 
Now that i have grown up, i realize that is pretty freaky and i was a brave kid.

46,my ghost,1297626018,"In 1996, my parents moved me (three at the time) to the farmhouse we had just built in a rural community just north of Toronto, Ontario. The house was of our design, and we built it ourselves. It was constructed on a large piece of property that included, from its previous owners, the remnants of an apple orchard and a burnt-out barn structure.

The upper level of our house is five bedrooms for my parents, myself, and my two older brothers. My brother's rooms are connected at the very end of the hall.

When we first moved in, we didn't know about the past owner of the property or anything about the land. The only hints we could find were the old apple trees, and we often had to dig old beer bottles out of the dirt while plowing. It was about three years after we had moved in that my oldest brother, Elton, commented to my dad that he had heard him walking around the night prior. My dad seemed confused, and claimed to have slept soundly though the whole night. My other brother, Clayton, backed up Elton's story about hearing footsteps walking down the hall very late at night. My parents assured us that it was just the house settling - very large and wood-framed, creaking and squeaking was to be expected.

And that was the assumption for quite a while until, while the rest of us were out camping, my mother heard somebody walking around the house. She was downstairs in the living room, directly beneath my brother's rooms, when she could hear someone slowly walking purposefully back and forth along the hallway. She immediately went up to look, but the moment she started up the stairs the sound stopped, and she found the hallway empty.

When we returned, she described what had happened to us and we all told similar stories; when the house is empty, or exceptionally quiet, one can distinctly hear footsteps traveling back and forth along the upstairs hallway just outside of my brother's rooms. Shortly after this, my mother ran into our realtor and inquired about the property's history. The realtor told her that the previous owner had a farm, an orchard, and a drinking problem. He was in serious debt and approaching foreclosure when one night, while exceptionally drunk, he wandered out to his barn for a cigarette. The embers caught on some hay and the barn went up in flames, trapping him and his livestock inside to burn.

Upon hearing this story from my mother we all, as you can imagine, got some serious goosebumps. But the one thing we agreed on, apart from that being a creepy story, was that whenever we heard the mysterious footsteps, none of us felt afraid. It never approached us, the temperature never changed, and we never felt threatened by it. Although unsettled by the idea of some burned drunk of a farmer wandering around our house, it just became something we accepted because it never changed.

Years passed without incident, our uninvited roommate taking the occasional invisible stroll through our halls, until our family held a barbecue to promote a friend for mayor. We sent fliers out to everyone in our community, and had the mayor there as a guest speaker. A man we had never met before approached my mom and I and asked ""Do you live here?""

When we said yes, the rough-looking guy explained ""I used to live here.""

(I'll be honest, my first thought was ""HOLY SHIT HE FAKED HIS OWN DEATH"")

When seeing our confused faces, the man continued ""My father used to own this land. He was in a fire.""

We talked a little about his father, the land, and the house we built. When we invited him in for a tour, he asked us ""so is the ghost still here?""

He went on to talk about how, ever since he was a little boy, he would hear a man walking back and forth across the floor above him, in his case their attic. He explained that the ghost was completely harmless, more anti-social than anything. It would always just serve to reassure him that, whenever he was home alone, there was someone else taking a little walk around to make sure everything was okay. 

The farmer's son seemed pleased to hear that the ghost had moved into our house, and still took a walk to check up on us every now and then. ""I think he just gets lonely,"" was what he said.

When we asked who the ghost was, the man had no idea. The only person who might have known was his father who, now deceased, had most likely taken the ghost's potential identity to his grave.

I decided to tell this story because, while home alone and reading other people's r/nosleep stories, my ghost just took a walk down the hall. Although a little creeped out by the stories people posted on here, it was nice to know I wasn't in the house alone. So just remember, the next time something creepy or mysterious or unexplainable happens in your house; someone might just want some company.

Anyway, get back, my other roommate convinces me to scare him.

Now, I own the Donnie Darko rabbit suit.  Got it on sale somewhere for half off, as there's no way I would normally pay $150 for a halloween costume, but I figured it was worth it for considerably less  Anyway, I'm still a bit buzzed, so forgive my terrible writing.  For reference, this is the [suit I own](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA01900016V5&amp;nm_mc=OTC-Froogle&amp;cm_mmc=OTC-Froogle-_-Costumes-_-Paper+Magic+Group-_-9SIA01900016V5)

In full suit, I go into his room at about 2:30am.  I kneeled at the foot of his bed and started grabbing at his feet.  He of course started kicking at me, so I held them in place.  He slowly took off his eyecover and just stared at me with wide eyes.  He then said ""Wake up...Wake up.  Matt...is that you?  Wake up?  Matt, this isn't funny, take off the bunny suit""

While he was saying this I slowly stood up and cocked my head to the left.  After he told me to take of the suit I slowly walked out of his door and closed his door gently.  I then walked into my room, took off the suit, and played TF2 in the dark.  After a few minutes he came over and asked me what was up.  I said something along the lines of ""not much.""

He then told me he woke up to Frank the Rabbit grabbing at his feet.  I asked him if he was having nightmares, and he said he had not woken up since.  He demanded to know if he was going insane from his fever (...of 99.5), or if I was fucking with him.  I had forgotten about his fever, so I apologized, and then he yelled at me in extreme profanity and threats of strangling me in my sleep.  I don't know if I've ever seen him that mad before.

So now I get to lock my door at night, and hope he gets over it.  Otherwise I'll probably wake up being strangled.

And since it's not really a story meant to scare someone in the way it's written, moreso just a ""Hey, I scared the crap out of my friend like so,"" a tl;dr would be

51,"""Please help. I'm lost. There are these cultists. They took apart my car. It's so cold. Please send someone.""",1297583451,"A college girl and her boyfriend were driving back to school after a trip to visit her parents.

The girl was a recovering meth addict, and her boyfriend was instrumental in getting her clean. They were, at this point in time, two young, sane, Christian, clean-cut people, madly in love and planning a wedding after graduation.

The parents didn't want them to leave, and tried to persuade them to spend the night and leave the next day, as it was supposed to snow heavily during the night. But they wanted to be able to get to classes they had in the morning. It was only a four-hour drive back to their school, so they figured they'd just drive carefully and get back in time for a nap before classes began. The snow was just starting to fall as they left her parents' house. 

Several hours after they left, her sister got a strange phone call from the college girl's cell. It's as if the phone called on accident; she could hear them talking, and it sounded like they were arguing over directions. After about three minutes of saying ""Hello?"" and being ignored, her sister hung up and wrote it off as an accidental call.

Six hours pass, and they did not call to let her parents know they arrived safely at the school. Her mother was paranoid, but the father and the sister just assumed they must've forgotten and gone to bed. They tried to coax the mother to go to sleep and call her in the morning, but the mother wanted to call the dormitory right away to see if they'd arrived.

The mother called several of her daughter's friends in the dorm, waking them up in the middle of the night to ask if she had arrived safely. All of them responded the same way - basically, ""I don't know, I was sleeping, I'll check on her tomorrow.""

Frustrated, the mother went to bed.

In the morning, the mother called the dormitory again to check on her daughter. Now her friends sound a little concerned. ""I haven't seen her,"" they respond. ""What time did she leave?""

The mother became concerned that her daughter was in a car accident, and she called local hospitals to check. Her daughter's name was not listed on any of the area hospitals' admission reports. The mother called the police to ask if there had been any car accidents involving her daughter, and was told no, nothing.

She received a call back from the police several hours later with the bizarre story of what had happened the night before.

The daughter had called 911 from her cell phone just two hours after leaving the house. She was calling to ask for directions, and during the recorded phone call she became increasingly confused and incoherent. The dispatcher informed her 911 was not an information line, and disconnected the call, thinking it was a drunken prank.

Fifteen minutes later, the daughter again called 911. Speaking to another dispatcher, she gave her name and her location just as she had in the first call, but she then began to tell the dispatcher there was something terribly wrong with the car. She claimed people were taking the car apart and putting pieces of it in the trees, where she couldn't reach them. The dispatcher told her to remain in the car and wait for police to arrive, but in an increasing state of panic, the girl announced she was sure she would die if she stayed in the car, and that she was going to get out and walk. The call ended when the girl hung up, as the dispatcher was still trying to tell her to stay in the car.

Another fifteen minutes passed. The girl called 911 a third time and spoke to a third dispatcher. She was shouting into the phone and did not respond to the dispatcher, reciting her name and location and then launching into a half-screaming rant about how her boyfriend was very sick and they needed an ambulance. While the dispatcher was trying to get a clearer idea of the girl's location, the girl began to scream obscenities and hung up the phone.

Fifteen minutes later, she called back. She recited her name and her boyfriend's name calmly, but then said she was afraid he was having a heart attack. ""He keeps throwing up,"" she said, ""and he's having trouble walking."" Halfway through the call the girl began to accuse the dispatcher of having poisoned her fiancee. She then hung up the phone.

The last call came about an hour later, and this time the girl was alternately crying and screaming. She described herself as being surrounded by short, unmoving ""Mexicans and black people"", all of whom watched as her boyfriend got sick and eventually died, none of whom were offering her any help at all. ""Why won't you help me? What the f--- is wrong with you? Please, please, send police. Send somebody. I think they are going to kill me."" And there the calls end.

Police were dispatched to the location the girl described, shortly after her second call. They found her car, undamaged and still running, with the doors open, on the side of the road. The radio was still on, and their coats and other winter gear were in the back seat.

They followed the footsteps leading away from the car - easy enough to do in the fresh snow. The path was winding and circuitous, doubling back on itself multiple times. They found several spots where it looked like one or both of the college kids had fallen into the snow and struggled to get up. There were no animal prints of any kind around them, no blood, and no signs of violence. It was after one of these inexplicable struggles that the footprints separated - the girl's continued northward, while the boy's went west.

They found the body of the girl's boyfriend after following his footprints for half an hour. He had been vomiting and falling down as he walked. He was curled into a fetal position and his lips were blue. His body was partially frozen.

The girl's footprints continued in that same winding, uncertain manner, up a steep hill, through a cow pasture, and over the edge of a cliff, where her body landed at the edge of a lake.

After doing an autopsy on the young man's body, they found evidence of methamphetamines in his system. They figured that during the kids' visit to her hometown, she had met up with some old friends and purchased some meth from them, which she shared with her boyfriend as they were leaving. Unfortunately - whether it was tainted or whether their systems just went abruptly into shock - the meth caused them to hallucinate so severely that they died as a result. They assume that the unmoving ""Mexicans and black people"" she had reported were actually cows standing in the pasture, watching her scream and walk sideways until she stepped off the cliff's edge.

52,The Calliope Piper [a /nosleep original story],1297583173,"I couldn't sleep last night. I was comfortable enough, in bed with my wife. It was 1:26AM according to my cell phone. I had been staring in the darkness at the ceiling. Thinking about everything and nothing at the same time. Tried counting sheep, drinking warm milk, everything I could think of. It was so far a sleepless night.

I decided to try out a solution proposed by a friend a few nights before. ""Go for a drive,"" he said, ""that usually drains my energy at night if I can't sleep."" So, I got out of bed slowly as to not rouse my wife. I was already wearing shorts and a t-shirt to bed, and as it was summer and the temperatures were warm, all I had to do was quietly put on some shoes and grab the car keys and I was off.

Driving around the town at night with the windows rolled down in balmy weather has an eerily calming effect. It is so quiet you can hear the electricity humming inside the streetlights. I had no direction in particular and the fresh air was really doing me some good. I had considered turning on the radio and playing some music, but it felt like doing so would taint the atmosphere. Anyone who has driven around 2AM will tell you, it's as if you own the road. So, of course it was startling for me to see a horse drawn cart seemingly appear out of nowhere.

I slowed my car and came up behind this strange vision before me. I could make out that there were two majestic horses pulling this giant cart, inside said cart housed what appeared to be a giant organ of sorts. A calliope, if I were to be precise. What was even stranger was that I couldn't seem to see any sort of driver.
I pinched myself. Nope, not dreaming. What I was seeing wasn't a hallucination. Driving at a crawl, I was following a relic of the past. Then, something broke the silence. It was the honking of a car behind me. I hadn't even noticed it arrive. They were obviously impatient at the slow speeds we were being forced to travel. But it was a one way one lane road and there was no other option. Then, the calliope began to play...

It was startling at first. Then, it too had a calming effect. The guy behind me wasn't honking anymore. Just driving. We were both listening. I lazily looked around as the sounds of some old circus song came from the pipes. Bursts of steam shooting out at each individual note. At this volume, you'd expect to see some lights turn on in the houses and people to walk out, but no. It was as if it was a private performance for me and the driver behind -- drivers... another car had appeared at the back of the line. This was turning into a small motorcade parade.
It seemed as if we were going in slow motion. The music from the pipes flowing and shooting into the air. It was a thing of beauty. Even in this dream-like state one question seemed to nag at me. Who was driving this thing? Moreover, I wondered if that very person was somehow playing the music. I had no idea how a calliope works. I was a good twenty or thirty feet behind the cart and decided I would close the gap as best as possible to try to catch at least a glimpse of the person behind this private evening show.

I edged closer and closer to the horse drawn cart. Ten feet away now, still couldn't see anything. So I made my car get as close as possible, almost touching... almost... a little further and a cloud of smoke. The cart had vanished. Just then from behind me, a deafening sound. A crash.

I hit the breaks and my head spun around. The two cars behind me had no chance. There was an inbound train going one way and an outbound train going the other. The two cars had been obliterated by the trains. As I was fast coming out of my trance, I could hear the warning bells of the trains. Why hadn't I heard them before? More importantly, why didn't the barriers come down and prevent us from crossing?

A few people died that day and when questioned by the police officers I had tried my best to explain, but... I couldn't seem to bring myself to mention this ghostly march and the head of the parade. Who would believe me? They would think that I was drunk or on drugs. I could be found responsible for their deaths. I simply said that there was just no warning signal. Perhaps it malfunctioned? I offered. One of the officers replied that perhaps that was the case, though it had been replaced as recently as last year when the last accident happened. The officer clasped his hand on my shoulder and said ""at least you aren't as crazy as the loon who escaped death that time. He was saying something about 'The Calliope Piper.'...""",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fkgoj/the_calliope_piper_a_nosleep_original_story/

One particular spirit i remember was one that walked around a house, placing stones at each corner. The mother inside ran out in fear just before the last stone was placed, and as soon as it was put down, the house collapsed. The main plot was the summoning of some major demon, and some society was accomplishing this by murdering people at specific locations, generating a giant diagram that they summoned it with.

My family never believes me when I tell this story, but I swear its true. When I was about 12 or 13 years old, I used to share a room with my sister as at that time we didn't have enough rooms in the house to let us each have our own room. We each had a bed on opposite sides of the room, each up against our own wall. It was early in the morning, and I had woken up about ten minutes before our alarm clock and just laid in bed, facing my wall. When the alarm clock goes off, I reached behind me without turning around and slapped the alarm off. I hear my sister sounding half asleep say ""I'm up! I'm up!"" So I wait another minute and then turn over in bed. As I turn away from the wall towards the rest of my room I find myself looking at this figure leaning over my bed staring at me. It was dark, and I could only make out the outline of the figure as it itself looked pitch black, kind of like a shadow that I couldn't see through. I assume its my sister being strange, so I just stare back for about 30 seconds before the figure stands up straight, turns, and walks out of my room. I decide its time to get up myself and walk over to the light switch in the room and flip it on. Thats when I started to freak out. My sister was still lying in bed asleep.

A similar experience happened to me again a few years later. I had my own room at this point, right across the hallway from my old room that I had shared with my sister, which had become her own room. I was sitting in my bed playing some video game which I don't recall now, when I got the feeling I was being watched. I turned around to face my bedroom door leading to the hallway and that solid shadow figure was just standing there, looking right back at me! I froze and couldn't do anything but stare back again. After a few seconds, it turned, walked down the hallway and into the bathroom at the end of the hallway. Somehow I got the courage to jump out of bed, run down the hall and into the dark bathroom after it, I guess my curiosity got the better of me. I flipped the light switch in the bathroom and when the lights came on, I was the only thing in there, the shadow figure had disappeared.",nosleep,DeviousToast,/r/nosleep/comments/fk8yw/the_shadow_figure/

___  

  
**OCTOBER — YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT**  

For Orin Incandenza, #71, morning is the soul's night. The day's worst time, psychically. He cranks the condo's AC way down at night and still most mornings wakes up soaked, fetally curled, entombed in that kind of psychic darkness where you're dreading whatever you think of.  
  
Hal Incandenza's brother Orin wakes up alone at 0730h. amid a damp scent of Ambush and on the other side's dented pillow a note with phone # and vital data in a loopy schoolgirlish hand. There's also Ambush on the note. His side of the bed is soaked.  
  
Orin makes honey-toast, standing barefoot at the kitchen counter, wearing briefs and an old Academy sweatshirt with the arms cut off, squeezing honey from the head of a plastic bear. The floor's so cold it hurts his feet, but the double-pane window over the sink is hot to the touch: the beastly metro Phoenix October A.M. heat just outside.  
  
Home with the team, no matter how high the AC or how thin the sheet, Orin wakes with his own impression sweated darkly into the bed beneath him, slowly drying all day to a white salty outline just slightly off from the week's other faint dried outlines, so his fetal-shaped fossilized image is fanned out across his side of the bed like a deck of cards, just overlapping, like an acid trail or timed exposure.  
  
The heat just past the glass doors tightens his scalp. He takes breakfast out to a white iron table by the condo complex's central pool and tries to eat it there, in the heat, the coffee not steaming or cooling. He sits there in dumb animal pain. He has a mustache of sweat. A bright beach ball floats and bumps against one side of the pool. The sun like a sneaky keyhole view of hell. No one else out here. The complex is a ring with the pool and deck and Jacuzzi in the center. Heat shimmers off the deck like fumes from fuel. There's that mirage thing where the extreme heat makes the dry deck look wet with fuel. Orin can hear cartridge-viewers going from behind closed windows, that aerobics show every morning, and also someone playing an organ, and the older woman who won't ever smile back at him in the apartment next to his doing operatic scales, muffled by drapes and sun-curtains and double panes. The Jacuzzi chugs and foams.  
  
The note from last night's Subject is on violet bond once folded and with a circle of darker violet dead-center where the subject's perfume-spritzer had hit it. The only interesting thing about the script, but also depressing, is that every single circle — o's, d's, p's, the #s 6 and 8 — is darkened in, while the i's are dotted not with circles but with tiny little Valentine hearts, which are not darkened in. Orin reads the note while he eats toast that's mainly an excuse for the honey. He uses his smaller right arm to eat and drink. His oversized left arm and big left leg remain at rest at all times in the morning.  
  
A breeze sends the beach ball skating all the way across the blue pool to the other side, and Orin watches its noiseless glide. The white iron tables have no umbrellas, and you can tell where the sun is without looking; you can feel right where it is on your body and project from there. The ball moves tentatively back out toward the middle of the pool and then stays there, not even bobbing. The same small breezes make the rotted palms along the condominium complex's stone walls rustle and click, and a couple of fronds detach and spiral down, hitting the deck with a slap. All the plants out here are malevolent, heavy and sharp. The parts of the palms above the fronds are tufted in sick stuff like coconut-hair. Roaches and other things live in the trees. Rats, maybe. Loathsome high-altitude critters of all kinds. All the plants either spiny or meaty. Cacti in queer tortured shapes. The tops of the palms like Rod Stewart's hair, from days gone by.  
  
Orin returned with the team from the Chicago game two nights ago, redeye. He knows that he and the place-kicker are the only two starters who are not still in terrible pain, physically, from the beating.  
  
The day before they left — so like five days ago — Orin was out by himself in the Jacuzzi by the pool late in the day, caring for the leg, sitting in the radiant heat and bloody late-day light with the leg in the Jacuzzi, absently squeezing the tennis ball he still absently squeezes out of habit. Watching the Jacuzzi funnel and bubble and foam around the leg. And out of nowhere a bird had all of a sudden fallen into the Jacuzzi. With a flat matter-of-fact plop. Out of nowhere. Out of the wide empty sky. Nothing overhung the Jacuzzi but sky. The bird seemed to have just had a coronary or something in flight and died and fallen out of the empty sky and landed dead in the Jacuzzi, right by the leg. He brought his sunglasses down onto the bridge of his nose with a finger and looked at it. It was an undistinguished kind of bird. Not a predator. Like a wren, maybe. It seems like no way could it have been a good sign. The dead bird bobbed and barrel-rolled in the foam, sucked under one second and reappearing the next, creating an illusion of continued flight. Orin had inherited none of the Moms's phobias about disorder, hygiene. (Not crazy about bugs though — roaches.) But he'd just sat there squeezing the ball, looking at the bird, without a conscious thought in his head. By the next morning, waking up, curled and entombed, it seemed like it had to have been a bad sign, though.  
  
Orin now always gets the shower so hot it's to where he can just barely stand it. The condo's whole bathroom is done in this kind of minty yellow tile he didn't choose, maybe chosen by the free safety who lived here before the Cardinals sent New Orleans the free safety, two reserve guards and cash for Orin Incandenza, punter.  
  
And no matter how many times he has the Terminex people out, there are still the enormous roaches that come out of the bathroom drains. Sewer roaches, according to Terminex. *Blattaria implacablus* or something. Really huge roaches. Armored-vehicle-type bugs. Totally black, with Kevlar-type cases, the works. And fearless, raised in the Hobbesian sewers down there. Boston's and New Orleans's little brown roaches were bad enough, but you could at least come in and turn on a light and they'd run for their lives. These Southwest sewer roaches you turn on the light and they just look up at you from the tile like: 'You got a problem?' Orin stomped on one of them, only once, that had come hellishly up out of the drain in the shower when he was in there, showering, going out naked and putting shoes on and coming in and trying to conventionally squash it, and the result was explosive. There's still material from that one time in the tile-grouting. It seems unremovable. Roach-innards. Sickening. Throwing the shoes away was preferable to looking at the sole to clean it. Now he keeps big glass tumblers in the bathroom and when he turns on the light and sees a roach he puts a glass down over it, trapping it. After a couple days the glass is all steamed up and the roach has asphyxiated messlessly and Orin discards both the roach and the tumbler in separate sealed Ziplocs in the dumpster complex by the golf course up the street.  
  

The yellow tile floor of the bathroom is sometimes a little obstacle course of glasses with huge roaches dying inside, stoically, just sitting there, the glasses gradually steaming up with roach-dioxide. The whole thing makes Orin sick. Now he figures the hotter the shower's water, the less chance any small armored vehicle is going to feel like coming out of the drain while he's in there.  
  
Sometimes they're in the bowl of the toilet first thing in the A.M., dog-paddling, trying to get to the side and climb up. He's also not crazy about spiders, though more like unconsciously; he's never come anyplace close to the conscious horror Himself had somehow developed about the Southwest's black widows and their chaotic webs — the widows are all over the place, both here and Tucson, spottable on all but the coldest nights, their dusty webs without any kind of pattern, clotting just about any right-angled place that's dim or out of the way. Terminex's toxins are more effective on the widows. Orin has them out monthly; he's on like a subscription plan over at Terminex.  
  
Orin's special conscious horror, besides heights and the early morning, is roaches. There'd been parts of metro Boston near the Bay he'd refused to go to, as a child. Roaches give him the howling fantods. The parishes around N.O. had been having a spate or outbreak of a certain Latin-origin breed of sinister tropical flying roaches, that were small and timid but could fucking fly, and that kept being found swarming on New Orleans infants, at night, in their cribs, especially infants in like tenements or squalor, and that reportedly fed on the mucus in the babies' eyes, some special sort of optical-mucus — the stuff of fucking nightmares, mobile flying roaches that wanted to get at your eyes, as an infant — and were reportedly blinding them; parents'd come in in the ghastly A.M.-tenement light and find their infants blind, like a dozen blinded infants that last summer; and it was during this spate or nightmarish outbreak, plus July flooding that sent over a dozen nightmarish dead bodies from a hilltop graveyard sliding all gray-blue down the incline Orin and two teammates had their townhouse on, in suburban Chalmette, shedding limbs and innards all the way down the hillside's mud and one even one morning coming to rest against the post of their roadside mailbox, when Orin came out for the morning paper, that Orin had had his agent put out the trade feelers. And so to the glass canyons and merciless light of metro Phoenix, in a kind of desiccated circle, near the Tucson of his own father's desiccated youth.

66,A bedtime story.,1297543948,"Inspired by another /r/nosleep, as it mentioned my hometown.

Background: I am in my late thirties, an atheist, and not superstitious in the least. I have, admittedly, run into things that I have never been able to explain. This is one one of them.

I grew up in Big Bear Lake, CA. It's a very small mountain community at the top of the San Bernardino Mountains. A ski resort, nestled into thousands of acres of coniferous forest. If you're a kid growing up there, without a car, there is very little to do.

Big Bear was part of the California gold rush. Although the wild west was not nearly as bloody as the movies portray, the gold rush very much was. Especially around Big Bear. Claims got jumped, people got murdered. Mines were dug, then left abandoned forever. It is not unusual for a hiker to stumble across an ancient mine, complete with nearly-gone tin cans and rotted wooden sluice troughs. Children in Big Bear are taught to never enter these mines, as an average of 1 person every three years is injured or killed doing so. They get crushed by falling debris, or fall down unexpected tunnels. Of course, this just makes them more alluring to the kids.

And there is very little else to do in Big Bear, if you're a kid in the summer. Most teens go hiking a lot. It's not difficult to get to the forest, after all - walk out your back door and get going. 

In a little place called Van Deusen Canyon, I loved hiking. 

http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.291447,-116.864437&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;sll=34.285389,-116.871847&amp;sspn=0.039184,0.0444&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.291252,-116.864104&amp;spn=0.00609,0.008615&amp;z=17

What I describe happened right about here. You can leave the main road (a single-vehicle dirt path that goes for miles through the wilderness) and see all manner of wildlife. Deer, black bears, bobcats, cougars, raccoons, etc. I was an avid outdoorsman in my teens, and loved taking my .22 and a camera out to see what I could see. Just throw a lunch in the pack, fill a canteen, get going at 10 am, come back around sundown.

It was a good day. I saw a grey fox with some kits around noon. Tried to toss them the crusts of my sandwich, but they fled as soon as they saw me. Found a giant timber rattlesnake just chillin' out on a boulder - left that one alone, though I took some pics. Mostly I just enjoyed the solitude, the wind in the pines, and the sounds of nature.

At four in the afternoon, I found a mine I'd never seen.

It was a hole burrowed into the side of the hill. No trash, except for a pile of tailings (the rocks and dirt dumped outside from whoever dug the mine shaft). A black hole, maybe 5 feet in diameter. I went forward to check it out.

It was your average summer day for the time and place - about 72 or so. As I got closer to the mine, the air temperature dropped palpably. My arms broke out in gooseflesh. Part of my mind said it was just cold air coming out of the mine, but I was a good twenty feet from it. I stopped moving forward. That was when I noticed there were no bids chirping, not a sound to be heard. Just the wind in the pines.

I decided to take a picture and leave. When I pulled out my camera, I accidentally dropped it. When I picked it up, I notced something white on the ground in front of me. I stared.

It was a tooth.

I'm not a dentist or forensics expert. It might have been from a deer or a wild donkey (they were rife in the area at the time). But if I had to make a money bet, it was a human molar, complete with roots and crown, just lying there.

I picked up my camera and took a picture of the tooth. Then I took a picture of the mine.

And then I got the hell out of there. I can't to this day say what spurred me, but I had a horrible feeling of unease.

The sun goes down fast in Big Bear, due to the mountains. I got back to the main road as the shadows of the western hills were overshadowing it - the hills to the east (where I'd just come from) were still lit by the waning daylight. I stopped at the dirt path and looked back the way I'd come. 

I saw him immediately.

About 100 yards away, a man stood on the hill. My eyes are good, to this day. Still, I could just see someone, a man in dark clothing, standing on the side of the hill I'd just traversed. His details seemed a bit blurry. He had long hair and a beard, and a button-up shirt that was unbuttoned. He stood there and didn't move at first.

I waved at him. He did not wave back. I could tell he was staring at me.

For some reason, I fumbled my camera up and took a picture of him. As I brought the viewfinder away from my eye, he suddenly pointed to the North. Stiff right arm, he didn't turn away, he just pointed to the north.

""Hello?"" I yelled. He did not reply.

Big Bear has many potheads. Most of them don't go hiking, but I figured this was some dude high as a kite, fucking with me. I decided to get going. After half a minute of walking south, I looked back. He hadn't moved. I walked more, and stopped when I came to a turn in the road that would take me out of line of sight of him. He was still standing there, pointing north. We were now at least 300 yards apart.

I rounded the corner at a brisk pace, because he was starting to creep me out. The shadows of the hills were lengthening. I was at least 5 miles from home, and didn't feel like hiking in darkness at the time. 

About two minutes after I rounded the corner, I looked over my shoulder. 

He was standing on the dirt path now. Maybe 50 yards from me. I still couldn't make out features, but he looked the same. He was staring at me.

""Can I help you?"" I asked. My voice cracked as I yelled it. He said nothing. Scared, I reached back and fingered the safety off my rifle. Just in case.

""Bye,"" I said, and started jogging. I looked over my shoulder every few seconds. He didn't move. He didn't point anymore. He just stared.

I rounded the last bend in the trail before it joined up with the paved backstreet right before the sun went out. I've never felt so relieved as I did the moment my boot heels hit asphalt. Like Ichabod Crane, I somehow felt that if I could get to the pavement, everything would be fine. I turned and looked back.

He was standing at the curve, in the center of the dirt road. 50 yards from me. I had not heard him, had not heard the normal crunch of dirt and gravel that accompanies someone walking in the silence of that place. And he was still staring at me. 

Now terrified, for reasons I've never understood, I unslung my .22 and held it at my hip in an unsteady stance. ""What do you want?"" I asked loudly. Part of me hoped the nearest houses, maybe half a mile away, would hear any sounds of trouble, if they happened.

The figure raised his arm and pointed backward - north. Back the way I'd come. 

""Leave me alone!"" I yelled, and raised the rifle to my shoulder.

He vanished.

To this day, I will swear on my dying breath that he did not dive into the bushes, or run off. There was no sound that accompanied his disappearance. He did not fade out like a special effect. One moment he was there. The next, he was gone. As if he'd never been.

I nearly ran the last four and a half miles home, constantly looking over my shoulder. It was my first of only three flop-sweats in my entire life. When I arrived, my mother asked me what was wrong. And this was the moment, the big one, for me - I'd never actively lied to my mother about something serious before. I was only in my early teens. I stopped and considered my story. I thought about how it would be received.

""Thought I heard someone following me,"" I finally muttered, and forced a smile. ""Just nerves.""

She bought it.

The next day, I took the film to our local Thrifty Drugstore to get it developed. I wanted to see what my camera had found - even paid (out of my meager allowance) for a 1-hour developing job.

But when I came back to pick up the pics, the photo tech just shook his head.

""The film was bad,"" he said. ""All of it was overexposed. Nothing but white.""

I asked him to show me the negatives. They were all solidly dark.

More than two decades later, I am a middle-class artist, novelist, and part-time IT tech worker. I am an atheist, and not superstitious at all. I still enjoy hiking, hunting, and taking pictures of nature. I live a thousand miles from Big Bear.

But I never hiked back into that section of Van Deusen Canyon.

And when I camp, around the time the sun goes down, I constantly check over my shoulder. Because I think he might be there. And if he ever is, I do not know what I will do.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fk7nm/a_bedtime_story/

69,Was my childhood house haunted?,1297528572,"Strange stuff used to happen at the house I grew up in. The house itself was moderately old. Built in 1951. Only one couple had owned it before my parents and I was under the impression that they had owned it until they died. 

The house itself was super creaky, always making cracking and settling noises. When I was around 11 years old and we'd lived there for 5 or 6 years, weird stuff started to happen. 

I started getting startled awake almost every night. I'd immediately look at my digital alarm clock and it would be 3:33AM. This became so regular that I eventually mentioned it to my mom. She got pretty freaked out and said the exact same thing had been happening to her. My little sister also confirmed that the same thing often happened to her. My dad has sleep apnea and snores like a mofo so the only possible logical explanation I could come up was that he was letting out a particularly large snore at that time and waking us all up... this went on for years though. Sometimes it would happen every night for the span of a month, sometimes it would die down for a while. 

I was at that time old enough to stay home by myself and watch my little sister when my parents wanted to go out. We had 3 cats. Several times I had experiences where I was sitting on a chair watching TV while one or two of the cats would be sitting on the ottoman. The cats would suddenly look at something to the left, and then both of them would follow it with their heads/eyes as it passed in front of me and exited into the kitchen on the right. I of course saw nothing. 

I should mention here that my mom is a lil bit eccentric. At some point she decided to paint this huge mural on my sisters bedroom wall. The mural was a bunch of cartoony looking school children lined up like they were getting their class picture taken. The problem was, it took her about a year to really get the majority of it done and by that time she started experiencing carpal tunnel and was unable to finish it. This resulted in a bunch of mostly finished school children, except their faces were all in different states of completion. Some of them had eyes but no noses or mouths, some of them had no faces at all. In the dark, this mural was fucking horrifying.

Several times my sister came screaming out of her room and into mine swearing up and down that she saw the one of the faces change. I never witnessed it but she still swears by it to this day.

I had a bunk bed which was raised over my desk and was right up against a big window. I had multiple occurances where I heard someone walking around in the bush outside my window. It sounded exactly like someone was walking in circles wearing big ass hiking boots. This would fill me with such abject terror that I wouldn't be able to move or call out for several minutes. In retrospect, this could have been a possum or a maybe even a person, but probably had a reasonable explanation.

Some very odd stuff happened when I was about 13 and I bought a Ouija board, but I don't really put much stock into those things so I won't go into that.

As I said my mom was a bit eccentric. She had a pretty big doll house that she built herself that she displayed on one of our bookshelves. It was this cutaway deal where one corner of the house was gone so you could see inside. She had it fully furnished and there was a little doll family which mimicked ours (mom, dad, boy and girl). One day we came home from a trip out of town. I think we had been gone several nights. As we walk into the entry hall, we see the doll house has been moved into the middle of the hallway which leads to our bedrooms and is sitting on the ground. Inside, the figures have been arranged so they are all laying together on the master bed face down. 

I'm now 30 years old. Looking back, I guess I do believe in ghosts, but I also consider myself a skeptic and try to find logical explanations whenever possible. All this shit is 100% true as I remember it. So anyways, what do you guys think. Was my house haunted?",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fk3qw/was_my_childhood_house_haunted/

I was Eleven and was spending the night with my Grandmother. Now she collects these things, but has them all in cases and etc in a set off room so that they aren't like sitting out in every room and basically freaking other people out. There is only one doll that she keeps out and it's an old one from her childhood that sits above her Fireplace. So anywho she knows I don't like the dolls so she generally keeps the door to the room closed and locked just so I don't think it's going to be open at any time.
Well we finish watching tv before bed time and I help her put out the fireplace and get goosebumps by the doll before going to bed. Well while sleeping I hear something that fully wakes me up; Giggling. So me being a kid get up and I go look around because I'm all inquisitive like that and I get to the Fireplace..the Doll is gone. So by now I'm freaked the fuck out and then I notice out of the corner of my eye the doll room door is open. I don't know what got me to go look but I did. I go in the room and the Fireplace Doll is there in the middle of the floor..and every..single..doll in the room is facing towards the door..All of them LOOKING at me.",nosleep,NecroMudkip,/r/nosleep/comments/fk1gb/dae_hate_porcelain_dolls/
74,Does anyone find snoring eerie?,1297509070,"Ever since I was little, I've found snoring to be extremly eerie. I think it's because when I was around 4 years old, I went to my uncles farm in some part of Mexico. I remember going to sleep on the floor while I heard the talk and laughter of my family who was sitting outside the house. Knowing other people were awake comforted me. I'm not exactly sure how long after I woke up. It was pitch black but I could still hear talking Coming from outside and some laughs here and there. They weren't as loud as before, but still audible. I got up, and walked out following the sound of the voices (the door was left open so fresh air could come inside) but when I stepped outside no one was there. everyone was sound asleep. Suddenly, silence. Then..I heard snoring. Almost a growl.

A man has a vacation in Japan. He plans his visit by walking to several destinations by map. One day, he ventures out into a forest, searching for a place to stay. It was night by the time he found a small japanese house, owned to a woman. The woman agreed he could stay for 3 nights, and no more. 

So the man prepared for bed, but he woke up past midnight to the sounds of footsteps and music. It was coming from the next room, so he got up and groped for the door, then walked down the hallway. He turned, and found a keyhole on the door. Curiosity got the better of him and he peeked through, and saw a young girl with long hair dancing, almost gliding in the air to the music. The man shurgged and went back to his room.

The next night, he woke up to the sounds again. So he got out of bed and looked through the keyhole. The girl was there, her long hair covered her face as she twirled in the darkness. He went back to bed, his fears rising.

The third night, he woke up to the sounds again. So he got out of bed and looked through the keyhole. The music suddenly stopped, and all he saw was red. 

Pure, utter, red.

The next morning, he asked the woman of what he saw. She replied: ""Oh, but my daughter died 8 years ago. She was an albino.""",nosleep,Xeeman,/r/nosleep/comments/fjyf4/i_couldnt_sleep_after_this_story/

82,Nightmare: His left thigh was little more than tough blackened skin around a bone core.,1297490480,"My husband and I were living in a shoddy, run-down apartment, with little more than a bedroom, bathroom, tiny kitchen, and living room.

I was deeply involved in some 64-bit horror video game that was mostly comprised of rescuing people from monsters. It was immensely frustrating; people were constantly running TOWARDS monsters, and then you'd have to hit the monster six or seven times with your club to make them release the person - and then, more often than not, the person's AI would glitch out and they'd run back TOWARDS the monster. 

My father-in-law was visiting, watching some unfunny animated series with my husband on the couch, while I sat on the bed playing this video game on a Gameboy. My father-in-law, in real life, is obese, cranky, diabetic, and has massive heart problems; he can barely get up the front steps without having a heart attack. In my dream, he kept LAUNCHING himself onto the bed beside me to excitedly tell me about the last episode of Unfunny Cartoon Show.

I wanted my father-in-law to leave so I could spend some time with my husband. For some reason I was feeling very lonesome and cuddly. But whenever my husband came into the room, something seemed wrong; he was friendly enough, and sweet, but he wouldn't look me in the eye, and I noticed a slight limp in his walk.

I followed him out to the living room, and as he sat on the couch I noticed there was something strange about the movement of his pants. Part of his leg seemed to be flat or shrunken.

I returned to the bedroom, and when he crossed the room to use the bathroom, I peeked around the door before it was closed.

His left thigh was little more than tough blackened skin around a bone core. Ropy cords of muscle lent the blackened skin a texture like corduroy. The rest of his leg appeared normal, as if a section of it had been cut away and then severely burned.

He shut the door without noticing me, and I sat on the bed, perplexed. Had he been in a fire or an accident? Why didn't I remember it? Why hadn't he told me?

I started to think about the massive strain of the injury, how much it must hurt for him to walk around. Yet here he was, going back and forth between the rooms with only a slight limp.

I felt suspicious. I was scared of his injury, and I suddenly felt sure he was going to try to burn the house down.

My father-in-law threw himself onto the bed again, and I told him he had to leave. ""You're kicking me out?"" he said, offended.

""B is going to burn down the house,"" I told him, packing some clothes in a bag. His face went white. He got up off the bed, backing away from me.

""What?"" I said. I heard the sink turn on in the bathroom, and shoved the bag under the bed to hide it from B, sure it would anger him.

He came out into the bedroom as my father-in-law said, ""You blamed him the first time, too.""

He looked at me with pity, revulsion, and resignation all at once.

I found myself holding a baseball bat, similar to the club in the video game I'd been playing. I woke up as I swung it at their faces.",nosleep,burke_no_sleeps,/r/nosleep/comments/fjxrg/nightmare_his_left_thigh_was_little_more_than/

86,An walking-at-night experience I won't soon forget.,1297481430,"I take night classes at a community college, which is about five miles away from home.  I usually take the bus, but last night, I got preoccupied asking my professor some questions about the lecture and missed the last bus.  I called some people if they could give me a ride, but they were all busy, so I just decided to walk home.  I don't know the exact time, but I probably left campus around 10:30 PM.


The area is the part of the city where the suburbs meet rural areas, so I walked through some dirt roads , only lit by the moonlight, to minimize my walking distance.  I was talking with my cousin on my phone to keep me company, but almost an hour in the walk, my phone died.  So I just walked alone in the dark of the night and the silence of winter.


I then arrived at an abandoned farm.  Not sure why it was abandoned, I just happened to pass by it every so often.  I decided that cutting through it would significantly drop my walking distance, so I climbed over the wooden fence and starting making my way through.


About a quarter into the farmland, I notice my left hand started to feel colder.  Then, it felt as if something was holding my hand.  I stopped walking instantly and pulled my hands together, warming my left hand with my right.  In my head, I continually repeated,"" what the fuck?""  I continued standing for about a minute of two, getting my composure back.  I gave out a long sigh and continued walking with my hands in my pockets.  However, within seconds, I started to feel like there was someone following me from behind, staring at me.  I didn't look back.


Now halfway through the farm, I start to hear a faint sound of a girl crying from behind me.  A moment of terror, but I tried to think reasonably.  ""Maybe it's just coming from a house near the farm.""  I calm myself as I continued walking, but the presence behind me was still there.


I was now passing the farmhouse, which is falling apart.  It looked really creepy in the dim moonlight, so I started to walk faster.  After I passed the house, the girl's crying ceased.  A moment of relief and complete silence.  Then out of no where, a loud shriek from the same voice came from behind.  I jumped from shock and pulled my hands out of my pocket without thinking, and at that moment, I felt the same cold feeling grasp my left hand again.  I turn around and see a small, dark silhouette standing right there.  I completely lost it, screamed in horror, and made a run for it.  I jumped the wooden fence on the other side, and ran until I couldn't run anymore.  (I'm overweight, so it's not that far.)


While catching my breath, I noticed that I dropped my backpack somewhere.  Regretting that I didn't put on both straps, I start to walk back the way I ran.  To my dismay, I couldn't find it anywhere and I walked all the way back to the fence to the abandoned farm.  At this point, I fall to my knees, finding out that I probably dropped my backpack in the farm.  I absolutely didn't want to go back there at the time, so I trudged all the way home.


Late the next morning, I biked to the farm with a friend of mine to find my backpack.  We hopped over the fence and found it halfway between the fence and the house.  My bag was open, but nothing was taken.  I'm not sure what conclusion I can make out of this one.  Maybe someone happened to look through my stuff, or that dark figure did.

91,Guitar,1297469714,"I had been already a few weeks by myself again as my then-husband was deployed for a few months. It was late winter in Alaska and I was enjoying reading, cleaning and listening to music by myself. It was also my first time completely alone and I was quite happy about it as I’m an introvert. I lived in an apartment complex that was very quiet and everyone was very amicable.

One morning I was woken up by the most beautiful melody being played. The windows of the bedroom where open and the morning sun was shining bright in my room and the music was being played on the acoustic guitar that was in the living room, where I usually left it leaning against the large wide open windows. It was a very simple note, played over and over and I thought to myself, *”Wow, this is so beautiful…”* but fear quickly climbed over me when I remembered that I was alone - had been for the past 3 weeks – and I was about to let out a shriek of total horror. The moment I was gonna open my mouth I felt my throat tighten, and in my mind I saw what looked as a child’s hand place itself over my mouth with the words, clear as day, say - *We didn’t mean to scare you.* 

I laid there, in complete fear. Silence was all over the house. I was petrified. I don’t know how long had passed but nothing happened. When I felt as if I wasn’t going to scream I felt/saw the “hand” leave my mouth and disappear. I sat up; silence in the room. I heard sounds being scraped under the door entrance and I yelled “GO AWAY!” not remembering that it was the paper boy leaving the newspaper under the door. Poor kid must’ve thought crazies lived in there...

I tried remembering the melody but the more I tried to recall it, the quicker it disappeared until it didn't exist in my head anymore. I couldn’t sleep for days for fear something similar would happen. I called my mom overseas where she found it funny. In the end she told me to bless the house and I did that night. I got some ice cubes and some sea salt for this, as it's something my aunt would do. I did a small improvised prayer and placed an ice cube on the windows and then I moved to the door. I put the ice cube down and threw the salt – and when I did I heard the most horrifying, murderous scream come down the hallway. I got cold and froze. I had never heard something so horrific. Was it coincidence? The apartments were so quiet, even months later nothing like this ever happened again. I threw more salt and repeated my improvised prayer and went inside. Nothing happened again there, until I moved to the new house.

92,I haven't been able to live alone for a long time.,1297468749,"Good evening, /r/nosleep. I've been lurking here for quite some time now, and I decided I'd share my tale. Just to give a little backstory, I was originally born in Essex, just outside of London. I lived there 'til I was 21, and I moved to the country to escape the hustle and bustle. God, I'm an idiot. 

I lived in a moderately sized two bedroom house, in a small village populated by a tiny number of people. For a long time, it was nice. No dealing with stop &amp; searches from police officers, no irritating neighbours, and for a little while, I really enjoyed the time I spent there.

That kind of gives some credence as to why what happened a couple years ago turned my life into a total state of sheer disarray. I spent a long time as an agoraphobe, and every time someone was to knock on my door, my adrenaline would race. It's worth noting that I now live with my parents again, despite being a 24 year old male who is entirely incapable of being alone in a house.

I think I've hyped this enough. I am an almost comatose sleeper. People have pulled ridiculous numbers of pranks on me whilst sleeping, and I haven't woken up. I had someone rest a sub onto my shoulder, then blare dubstep into my head. One night I woke up, for no reason, with no bodily functions irritating my sleep. But something just felt... *wrong*, and I'm not prone to paranoia. 

I decided I was thirsty anyway, and I groggily made my way downstairs to treat myself to a brief glass of water, before returning to my sleepcoma. My kitchen looked out onto my expansive, open garden. I owned no pets, so I had no fence. I often used to look out at the hills, the horizon and the rolling mounds of farmland. Tonight, I could only see two streetlights in the distance, which was odd. I didn't remember any planned additions, but I'd been busy with work, so I shrugged it off, finished my water, pulled my dressing gown tight around me to shrug off the breeze, and went back upstairs. 

When I awoke the next morning, I was bolt upright, sweating profusely and ice cold, realising that *my house did not have a draft and I had closed all of the windows.* I tentatively went downstairs, cricket bat in hand, complimenting myself on my massive balls, until I saw the window just above my kitchen sink... I don't know how to put this. Missing. Gone. Not where I had fucking seen it yesterday. 

I hadn't seen streetlights. I had seen *headlights*, and I had stared into the silhouettes of my burglars for a good two minutes.

It's maybe German, or Danish, not an English film. It features a girl talking to her boyfriend who's at work, via a webcam. Later, the girl is talking to another girl via chat roulette or something similar. The other girl looks very distressed. The lights go out and she is dragged away from her computer, back into the darkness. 

Sorry for being so vague, I can hardly remember much about the film. There's more to it than what I've described, but memory fails me.

You pick it up and look at the nail.  It's gone.  The nail is laying on your pillow.  You look back at the hole in the wall and see that there is some kind of gooey liquid dripping out. 

You touch the stuff.   It's sticky.  You smell it.  You realize that it's blood. 

You go to the kitchen to find a paper towel.  You think it's odd to find blood in your wall.  When you get back to the bedroom, you see that there is blood running down the wall. 

You try to stop the flow with the paper towel.  The hole has gotten bigger.  The blood starts to spray into the room. 

It's getting all over you.  You're soaked now.  It's flowing even harder now.  The hole is about a foot wide. 

You wade through the mess into the living room.  Your apartment is ruined.  The blood is up to your knees now. 

You try the front door.  It doesn't open.  It's jammed.  You start to panic.  You grab for your cell phone.  It's soaked. 

The blood is up to your waist now.  The smell is overwhelming.  You pound on the door to try to get out.  No one answers. 

The blood is up to your neck now.  It's getting into your mouth.  You're gagging on sticky blood. 

You have to stand on the counter to breathe.  The blood is almost filling the room.  You don't know what to do.  Your face is against the ceiling. 

You take your last breath and try to swim to the window.  The light makes the murky liquid almost look pink.  You hit the window.  Nothing.  You kick it.  Nothing. 

Your lungs are burning.  They are dying for oxygen.  You feel weak.  You wonder why this happened as you inhale the thick red liquid.

3,You guys have ruined my ability to respond rationally to situations.,1297441303,"For background, I live with a roommate on the ground floor of what is basically a duplex. The downstairs unit is the basement, and we share nothing with the tenant renting it other than the back yard. Basically, the roommate and I are the only ones in and out of our part of the house.

My roommate works as a waitress at a night club, so she's gone from 7 at night to around 3 or 4 in the morning. I usually go to bed around 11 or 12.

It should also be noted that my dog has some strange habits. He's quite restless and also a light sleeper. He gets up in the middle of the night and whines to be let outside, even when he doesn't have to pee, and whenever he hears my roommate come home in the early morning, he gets up to go see her. He also occasionally barks at either the front or back doors like he sees someone outside. (It's the same bark as when he sees the dogs from downstairs playing out back.) But most of the time that I get up to check, there's nothing outside. (Yesterday, though, he was barking at a squirrel in our garbage that I didn't see until I was standing next to him at the door, so maybe this one's on me.)

Last night was the same routine. I went to bed at about 10, though, since my sleep schedule got thrown completely off by a recent overnight shift at work. I left the front door unlocked for when my roommate gets home, as she's usually tired and cranky, and fumbling with her keys in the dim porch light only exacerbates that. I was planning on watching a movie in bed but ended up falling asleep about ten minutes into it.

As predicted, my dog got up a few hours later to go outside. The door to my bedroom doesn't latch, but it opens inward, so he can't work it himself and just stares at it and whines until he wakes me up. I would just leave it open, so he could go to the back door and whine, and I could sleep through it, but I can't sleep with the door open; it creeps me out for some reason, has since I was a kid. I also suspect my dog is too smart to fall for the trick and would just come back and whine in my face.

I get up, let him out back, go to the bathroom, call the dog back inside, and go back to bed with him again beside me.

Again as predicted, he next wakes up when my roommate comes home. She opens my bedroom door for him, and he goes out to see her. Neither of them makes much noise, so I can fall right back to sleep.

This morning, I wake up and, wanting to return the consideration, am quiet enough that my roommate can sleep in. The first thing I notice is that my bedroom door is wide open, which, as stated earlier, is always a little unsettling to me. It's not an unusual occurrence, though. Like I said, it doesn't latch, and the dog always pushes it open when he wants to come back in.

I get up and walk as quietly as possible down the hall before noting that my roommate didn't lock the front door after she came in last night. I'm slightly annoyed with this until I notice her car isn't in the driveway either. At this point I remember that she said she was going to be staying at her mom's a couple nights ago. I didn't see her at all yesterday, so this is probably more of an extended stay than I thought. Miscommunication. So I just left the door unlocked all night for no reason. Now I'm annoyed with me.

All of this settles fine with me until I remember that I'm not the one who opened my bedroom door last night.",nosleep,Cptn_Hook,/r/nosleep/comments/fjifz/you_guys_have_ruined_my_ability_to_respond/

I was standing outside of a very peaceful log cabin with my dad. We were on top of a mountain, staring across a huge river and beautiful mountains. The view was so beautiful I began taking picture which I soon noticed the image of each picture was becoming more and more yellow/orange. Soon enough I took the time to look away from the tiny rectangle my digital camera provided. I raised my head, facing east.
Clouds, entire clouds were falling from the sky as if they were pieces of dough. It took me a few seconds to realize that the falling clouds were forming a shape. A circle. A gigantic circle around the center of tall tall buildings in the horizon. As soon as i realized this a huge red beam descended onto the plantet. It made a sound as horrifying and ear piercing as an extremely low and shrill banshee. Low enough that the reverberations were shaking my entire being and quivering my soul. 
I ran into the house. My father followed yelling to take cover; to find shelter. I was half way to the underground shelter when I realized I could no longer breathe. 
The oxygen betrayed me. 
As I ran I tried to inhale.
There was no more oxygen left to breathe.


My father and I reached our destination. 
I turned to him, looking for an answer. Why can't I breathe?

14,My house in Pakistan. (True story),1297374503,"I used to live in Pakistan in my grandparent's house. It was a joint family thing so my dad and 3 of his brothers and their family as well were living  there. I moved to Dubai when I was five but I still went to Pakistan nearly every year to that house. 

Now, there were 3 floors in this house as there were a lot of people living there. I was told that my grandparents moved into this house when they got married which was around 50 years ago or so. The top floor had 2 rooms and a lot of open area where I used to play with my cousins a lot as a kid. As a kid I was always told never to go into the second room on the top floor at night alone, and even though I was never really scared of the dark, that room always scared me and just had a a creepy vibe to it. Even worse was the fact that even the adults in the house seemed quite hesitant of going into that room at night.

As I grew older I grew more and more curious about that room. I mean it was just a simple room with a bathroom and a bed in it. So one day I was finally told the story about that room. Turns out that when it was built (years before I was born) it was used quite often as a guest room where people slept if they stayed over. But everyone who used to sleep there used to complain about feeling very uneasy there are night. A couple of my uncles even said they felt like they heard hushed voices during the night. After a while I was told it got worse, and people who slept on the bed in that room felt like they were being kicked during the night.

This was enough for my superstitious grandmother and she called in some religious people to do some rituals in that room. It was their consensus that there was a ghost occupying that room that was unhappy with other people spending the night there.

To this day I do not know whether to believe that or not, but every time I visit my grandparents I always notice that that door has been locked from the outside and no one ever spends the night there any more.

15,The Little Girl in the Darkness,1297370779,"I came to laying on the old decaying wood of a long forgotten bunk bed. It reminded me of the bunk beds at summer camp, except instead of a lice infested mattress all I had was splinters to lie on and a tattered old sheet to keep me warm.

I rolled over to try and find a comfortable position and that's when I saw her. At first she was only an outline against the darkness behind her. As she drew closer to me I began to make out features, a slight build and small height...she couldn't be any older than eight. She took another step and stopped in her tracks, leering at me. Here eyes weren't normal eyes, just pools of black hopelessness. Her hair hung limp and stringy, whole clumps missing from her scalp.

I didn't know what to do, the room was so cold. I just laid there hoping she was looking through me. I couldn't take my eyes off of her, both sympathy and abject horror rising from my gut on a pillar of stomach acid.

She started to rock back and forth, and then lurch like she was ill. After dry heaving for a few seconds she thrust her hand into her mouth and pulled it out, followed by a black stream of what appeared to be old blood and vomit. Seeming relieved, she began to move towards me again. My mind was screaming at me to run as fast as I could but my body wouldn't move.

She's standing next to the bed, pulling back my sheet. I feel her icy skin against mine as she settles in next to me and whispers quietly, ""Hold me, I'm scared.""

It was only then that I saw what my eyes had been to afraid to show me, there were no walls around this room. The darkness around us was composed entirely of shadows, and it was closing in quickly.

My eyes shoot open, I can't move but I can feel my bed. I can feel the egyptian cotton sheets beneath me as well as the sweat drenching them. I sigh a mental sigh of relief and wait for the rest of the sleep paralysis to wear off so I can roll over and go back to sleep. And that's when I hear it, in the corner of the room that I can't yet turn my head to see...the sound of a child dry heaving.",nosleep,Phraenk,/r/nosleep/comments/fizuc/the_little_girl_in_the_darkness/
16,Let's talk about fear...,1297370591,"So, I'm pretty intrigued by this idea that people actually *enjoy* putting themselves in situations that they know will scare them or disturb them.  There isn't a single reason, of course - for some it's the sheer delight of of being frightened, for others it's the idea of proving to yourself that your rational mind cannot be shaken.  Yet others still are captivated by seeing what gruesome perversions others can concoct in the depths of their mind and bring them to life.  There's something primal that draws us in - we can't bring ourselves to watch sometimes, but we can't look away.  And, of course, it's just fun.

We're all familiar with the usual phobias and the things that frighten most folks - spiders, snakes, clowns, blood, darkness, etc.  What are some things that frighten or disturb you and why?  For example, a gargoylesque monster wouldn't bother me too much, but a create that had a disfigured human face, like a goat with a sinister human face that made blood-curling noise would get to me.

The reason the goat monster would be bothersome over the gargoyle is because I feel your mind would instinctively try to empathize with it because of its humanoid features.  You would think it would have emotions and a conscious as well, even if it was essentially nothing more than a disfigured animal.  What would such a creature be thinking?  What's causing it to make those awful sounds?  Perhaps this type of fear is slightly influenced by the concept of the uncanny valley.

To me there's practical fear, like being scared of a lion because it could physically hurt you, and then there's another kind of fear that just unsettles you, the kind of fear that makes you curl up under the covers because there's *something* lurking in the shadows of your bedroom.

So let's discuss the philosophy of fear...",nosleep,theghostofabe,/r/nosleep/comments/fizqw/lets_talk_about_fear/

19,My haunted ghost story,1297361202,"I moved to the country with my parents when I was 5, the house we lived in was built 30-40 years prior and was very creepy.

I was always afraid of the dark but became TERRIFIED after a late night experience.

There I am trying to fall asleep and not wanting to open my eyes. At first I hear a noise from my closet, and the closet door the creaks. I start to cry silently as I hear footsteps coming closer and I keep trying to close my ears so I don't have to experience what's happening.

The second the footsteps stopped I knew something was wrong, and about 5 seconds later something grabbed both my armpits as hard as possible (I can feel the sensation again just talking about it.. shudder) like someones trying to pick me up to steal me. I FLIP THE FUCK OUT and start screaming bloody murder as my parents rush into the room and turn on the light to find me on the floor. 

I slept in my parents room that night, and moved into the computer room the next day. For almost 10 years after that day I had to have all my blankets tightly up against my armpits, and I mean tighter than a virgin midget.  It was so bad I would lose circulation and wake up with arms limp with no blood and in a lot of pain.

23,The Path,1297347072,"My eyes are closed I can feel a warm breeze across my face, it's the warm breeze of summer. I open my eyes and I'm standing in a field of grass, this doesn't surprise me though, I've had this dream before. The sky is nearly clear with a few puffy clouds lazily meandering across the horizon. The sun is warm yet not oppressive, trees along the edges of the field sway back and forth with a calming rhythm. I take my time enjoying the surroundings, brushing the tips of the knee-high wild grass with my palms. I make my way towards one edge of the field, I can smell the allure of the pine trees the musty smell of an old forest. An old deer path catches my interest so I push my way through the brush to follow it, curiosity drives my purpose. 

The path is barely visible with ferns and brambles obscuring many parts. It winds around tall oak trees and dips down into shallow valleys I continue to follow it forging my way through the brush that dots the trail. The deeper I go the more stifling the air becomes the sky slowly turns overcast the groaning of the trees all around eerie, like the groans of wounded people. My pace quickens, I think about turning around for a fleeting moment but decide I better press ahead. I follow the path for what seems like an eternity certain that darkness is going to come at any moment. A thought pierces my troubled mood the only sounds are my breathing and the groans of the trees, I haven't heard any animals that usually thrive in a forest. I stop straining to hear anything, my heart starting to beat faster with worry, I can hear something ahead so quiet I can't make it out. I dash ahead the sound getting closer, tree's branches lash out against my face and hands as I race towards the sound. Ahead I make out a river, as I get closer I can see the river is deep and the current swift, too fast to swim across. Something tells me I need to get to the other side.

 The oppressive forest casts deep shadows and it feels like there's something watching, I keep looking over my shoulder expecting to see something. I decide I should follow the river a ways and see if there's a crossing point, interestingly enough the path mimics the river's flow. I continue down the path following the bank of the river the roar of a waterfall getting closer, I can see the water picking up speed as it cascades over a cliff. I notice a tall pine fallen across the river its branches broken into dagger-like spears the path leads right to it. I carefully cross the river, the ominous branches a constant reminder of the price of making a mistake or losing my balance. The path picks up on the other side but the forest seems to thin, I can see something grey through the trees. As I approach the edge of the forest I see another field but unlike the one I started in this one has a ring of stones, huge monoliths like stone henge. The sky is dark massive thunderheads roll across the sky, boiling lightning illuminating within the clouds. I make my way into the center of the stones dread creeping inside, I know I do not want to be there anymore. The wind picks up howling through the trees bending them to dangerous levels.

 I get the creepy feeling of something watching me again, I spin around, this time I'm confronted with a shadowy figure. The blood drains from my face, I strain to see the figure better but it's like his body pulls shadows around him cloaking him in blurry darkness. He steps closer, I'm paralyzed with fear I can feel my hands shaking and my breath gets quicker. As he gets closer I notice his eyes, they're mine, but they're my eyes when I'm angry, my vision turns red. I'm in a room laying on the bed, I notice it's my bedroom my eyes are open, everything is a vision of red. The only feelings I have are hate, anger, and destruction. My wife calls my name, I can hear her coming closer my rage boils at the sound, she enters the room checking in on me, I stare at her with hate filled eyes a low growl rumbling deep in my throat she startles at the look in my eyes and slowly backs away. . .",nosleep,MoridinZero,/r/nosleep/comments/fiqw4/the_path/
24,Dream of being dead,1297341608,"Throw away account.

I've had an awfully weird dream long ago but I have a curse of remembering dreams in very good detail, especially the once that make no sense what so ever.

In the dream I was in my room on the computer playing games. I notice a wind pick-up in the room and to my sheer disbelief I see a very small tornado on the ground near the power cables. The tornado is rubber-banding about the place and I notice these sparks coming from the bottom of it (think welding). I try to move away but the damn thing starts moving up my body and towards my head. I reach for the top to try and pull it away (oh man tell me about it... pulling on wind &gt;.&gt;) but it starts drilling into my head, what's strange is I'm not freaking out I'm completely calm in the dream, sparks fly about the place and I feel something pop and feel that the small tornado slipped my hands and drills right through my head... and everything goes black, completely black no dream nothing just black. I'm literally waiting in the dream for something to happen and nothing... so in the black dream I get bored and decide to wake-up.

Just wanted to share this, not really scary just seemed odd that even in the dream the concept of death is the same as in life... nothing happens when we die (my opinion only no offence to others).",nosleep,anon123123123,/r/nosleep/comments/fipo6/dream_of_being_dead/

I very much enjoy the time I get to spend with the family, I could feel the warmth of love around me.  It was a feeling that can only be compared to the warmth of the sunlight entering through a window to greet you on the best of mornings.  Then, I began to feel very happy, a happiness the likes of which it is hard to explain, something transcendent of happiness.  I was filled with a brightness that seemed to overflow from my entire body.  The things and people on the television began to get a bit blurry, and time started to run a bit funny.  I wondered for a moment, what's wrong with the television?  My arms were numb, like having been slept on for a few hours.  The numbness spread quickly.  I could no longer think, I had no thoughts.  I heard my mom say, ""You *are* dead, aren't you?""  My vision faded away slowly into a small dot of light.  I continued to feel a very powerful numbness, I could focus on nothing else and I could not escape it.  There were no thoughts, there was nothing: completely void.  It seemed to last forever.

Then I woke up.  I was filled with a panicked sense of immediate doom.  Somehow, I went back to sleep and haven't dreamt of anything like that sense.

42,Demon Wrestling?,1297256440,"This is a true story. Throwaway for anonymity.

I was about 16 years old and living rough. I had had a couple of prophetic dreams when I was a kid but other than that, no really bizarre experiences. My mother raised me as an atheist. 

So my friend and I are walking down one of the city's main streets and there is one of those New-Agey type shops that have a display in the centre of various types of crystals and stones. One compartment has these black stones and the display card says that they were used in burial rites. By whom, I don't recall. Didn't think it very important at the time. I was wearing a big trenchcoat and I pocketed one of the stones and walked out with it. 

Later in the day we were invited to a birthday party for twin sisters who I'd never met. My friend was a bit of a hippy and she knew them. When we got in the house I noticed a really strong smell and was told that one of the residents was an aromatherapist. I also noticed a deck of Aleister Crowley tarot cards on the coffee table. I had a set like that, didn't think much of it. I only mention these things because it's what I remember of that day. I'm not saying the stone or the smells or the cards had anything to do with what happened. I don't have an explanation and tend to think any involving those things would be pretty silly. But I digress.

The only drug I had ever touched at this stage of my youth was weed. I had foster parents who were pot smokers and I started pretty young so I was thoroughly accustomed to the effects. Someone started to pass the bong around and I happily partook as everyone engaged in small talk. After a couple of pipes I was feeling pretty relaxed and chatted away with people for the next hour or so. I was sitting on a bean bag against a wall when I started to feel this niggling tension in my neck. Over time it got more and more annoying and I tried to casually roll my head around and stretch the muscles in my neck. I wasn't helping. It felt like it made my neck stiffen even more. At that point, one of the hippies noticed my contortions and offered me a massage, which I gratefully accepted. The more she massaged my neck, the stiffer it felt, until it actually began to feel as though something was gripping the muscles and bones of my neck. I'd never experienced anything like this before. 

Some more time passed and I must have already looked weird rolling my head around when I felt a similar sensation in my lower back. This time it felt as though something was gripping on the base of my spine and the part between my shoulder blades and the neck still hadn't let up. I started to feel little twitches and was getting embarrassed. I knew at that point that whatever was going to happen shouldn't happen in the middle of the party, for some reason. I asked if there was somewhere I could lay down and was shown to a rectangular room with a mattress in the corner. I laid down and spent about half an hour trying to find a comfortable position. It was no use. By now it felt like something was gripping those points in my neck and spine and just wrenching this way and that. I was contorting all over the place. Then it felt as though something was gripping my lungs and squeezing all the air out. This is the point where I start to get really scared. I'm gasping for breath and the spasms get more violent until I felt myself literally thrown (by nothing) off the mattress and onto the floor. Then it lifts me again and throws me against the wall. Now I am panicking. Obviously I've made a lot of noise and one of the twins enters the room with my friend. I am thrown again twice while they watch. They freak out and I'm trying to tell them I can't breathe, being pulled and pushed and thrown all the while. They ask if I want them to call an ambulance but the twin goes and calls one rather than waiting for a response. I was starting to worry that I was going to die. When the ambulance arrived they managed to strap me into a stretcher and I screamed out that I couldn't breathe. A paramedic points out that if I couldn't breathe I wouldn't be able to scream. 

So I'm in the back of the ambulance and they're trying to do their thing but are getting frustrated that I can't/won't stay still. I breathlessly try to remind them that that's the whole problem but I can see they are thinking I must be drug-fucked or insane and they just can't be bothered with this shit. They kept asking me what I had taken and got more pissed off when I swore I'd only had two bongs. The spasms started to calm down at this point and I asked them to request a drug test at the hospital because I wanted an explanation for what was happening to me and their assumptions were obviously wrong.

Just before reaching the hospital the ""grips"" tightened around my spine and neck again. They got me into a room and the doctor who attended me called for two more doctors to check out the situation. It would have gone on for about another 45 min, then as soon as I could lay still they started taking blood and doing various tests and I passed out, exhausted.

A couple of hours later I awoke to a nurse saying I was gonna be able to go home. The doctor came down and asked how I was feeling. I told him I was exhausted and embarrassed and asked what the hell had just happened to me. Was I epileptic or something? He said that the drug screen had come back clean (apart from weed), I was definitely not epileptic and that what I experienced was not a ""fit"". 

""So, what then?"" I asked. 
""We don't know.""
""Well what the hell am I supposed to do if it happens again?"" 
He just gave me his card and said ""Come back here."" 
Great.

For ages after that, whenever I felt a bit of tension in the neck or back I was terrified it might happen again. I got really worried that it might happen when I was alone and no-one would be able to help me. After I left the hospital I threw the stone into the river that runs through the city. I have never experienced anything like that again since.

TL;DR Some unseen entity threw me around a room.

I'd love to hear if anyone out there has experienced/heard of anything similar to this.

Staring at me. Watching me. Breathing on my neck. If I move, they'll know I'm awake and I don't know what they may do. 

It all started three weeks ago. I moved to a new city in search of a new life. To start over. I didn't know anyone, but was able to find some old friends of my parents who were willing to house me while I looked for a job and an apartment. The first night there, I woke up and could feel eyes watching me. I struggled to look through the darkness, but there was nothing there. But even though I couldn't see it, I could **feel** it. I turned over and squeezed my eyes shut. But I could still feel whatever It was. 

As the weeks went by, it became gradually worse and worse. Whatever it was, I was starting to see it. At first, it was just a shadow standing in the doorway. But eventually, I could see it standing at the foot of my bed. The last time I was brave enough to look, I could see its eyes, those burning eyes, staring at me. It smiled, not a human smile. There was nothing human about this entity. It showed its teeth to me, there seemed to be hundreds of them, razor sharp. That was the last time I looked at it. That was last night. 

I can't tell what it wants, but just having it in the room with me fills me with dread. I can still feel it staring at me, like a hawk watches its prey. It's close to the bed now, maybe bending over. I can't roll over, I can't bear to see it standing there. But I can feel it, smiling. Waiting. 

It's breathing on my neck. ",nosleep,al343806,/r/nosleep/comments/fhvob/the_thing_in_the_room/

Swirling around my bed

It would call to me this night

Whose sole intention is to haunt me

To turn my fear into reality

So it may feast on the very flesh

Whose sole want is to break free

So it can corrupt

forced down throats to cause corruption deep inside lungs

to cause more evil to spread from the first mind that started it all

and it can feast once more, is its wish

the only wish it ever made

from the bottom of the basement that housed all evil arose this that comes from every mind

especially from a child, but sometimes it just cannot wait

it travels to an adult where the true hell forms

he can never sleep again

and neither can you

praise him! praise him! 

praise be to the mortal

His flesh is my meal

His blood is my drink

I now feast on that memory for a hundred years

Oh, how cunningly I fished out his bone to feast on pure meat and veins

they're gushing 

they're bursting

and it all began with me

my corrupted mind, letting a bit of that evil loose

and now it's everywhere

",1297156226,"But when I do, I lucidly dream into areas most people do not understand..

Last night, I had a “dream” that I was in bed with my boyfriend, to my right, my boyfriend laid there in complete slumber. To my left, a lady covered in black. She would stare at me, and then I would yell; “DO NOT DO THAT, YOU WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN AGAIN” and then I look at my boyfriend, and all he does is wake up, eyes completely wide eyed and white, and he would stick his tongue out and with his own hand he would stretch it outside his mouth to the point where it is at least  9 inches long, and then he would bend in several places it as if he was breaking it, into little fractures, and he would fall back asleep, tongue out and all. 
The same old cloaked lady showed up some other night, there were islands in a swamp. And I was jumping from one to one, and then she finally reaches out to me and she takes her hood off. And it is my father, as he disappears into smoke.
One night, as I was sleeping, I felt this gravitational pull out of bed, I thought maybe another lucid dream, all I can see as I was paralyzed with fear is the print of a mid-century artist on my wall.  It could have been Dali, I don’t know. But I remember looking so intensely at it until it fell of the wall. I thought nothing of it, I woke up in the morning. The print was on the ground.
I have had times when I fell asleep in mid winter, windows closed, heaters on. And after having another sleep paralysis episode, I can see myself flying out the window, I freed my body after a long fight and just recollecting that I can finally sleep. Only to wake up in the morning and see the windows that were closed, wide open, curtains to the wind.
I have many experiences like that.

55,Building 32,1297106883,"Between helping my girlfriend move out of her apartment yesterday and not getting very much sleep for the past few nights, I now have the chance to share something that recently happened to her and I.

Back in November, my girlfriend moved out of her parents' place and into an apartment complex in the city where we live.  She was pretty excited as it was her first time out on her own and she'd carefully researched her options, finally settling on one that was just a few blocks away from work and right next to a little shopping center.  It's the cookie-cutter variety apartment complex that you'll find sprawled across most college cities in America and built in the last fifteen to twenty years.  Nothing spectacular or interesting about it other than the fact that we'd learned that it was built over an old military outpost.  She ended up picking a unit that was on the second floor and right next to the unit that was at the farthest end of the building.  This particular building only had two stories.

We moved her stuff in over the course of a couple of weeks and, little by little, she bought the things she was missing.  We only introduced ourselves to one of the neighbors downstairs, but other than that, we pretty much keep to ourselves.  I've got a place of my own, but I stay at her place most weekends.  Starting around December, I noticed that the neighbors she shared a wall with were pretty noisy bunch.  It'd be two or three in the morning and they'd be yelling, screaming, and jumping around.  We could hear them through the thin walls, but couldn't understand them since they weren't speaking English.  The only thing we knew was that it sounded like it was about ten to twelve men.  No biggie, though, as I'm a pretty heavy sleeper and pretty patient and figured it was just some college kids.  Elizabeth didn't care to much about it since we were the ""new kids"" there and didn't want to make a big stink.  Besides, she figured somebody else would complain about it - they could be the ""bad guys"".  

This went on a few times a week throughout December and continued on until January.  Again, it never really bothered us since we were pretty heavy sleepers and they'd only be noisy for a few hours a night.  The rest of the time they'd be absolutely quiet.  Finally, over the past few weeks, her neighbors started getting louder than usual and for longer periods of time.  They started chanting, clapping, and banging on the walls.  I told my girlfriend that this was getting ridiculous and that I was going to bang on the wall let them know that they were being too noisy.  She begged me not to, saying that since she was a female that lived alone most of the time, she didn't want to end up on anybody's shit list and have them retaliate against her.  I then offered to call the cops and she again advised against that for the same reasons.  As far as we knew, we were the only unit that shared a wall with that particular neighboring unit since that unit was a pretty large and had a garage underneath it.  Since we were theoretically the only people that could be bothered by their noise, any anonymous complaint could easily be deduced to coming from us.

This past Friday and Saturday were the last straws.  Friday night, they began making noise at around ten that night and kept it up until about four that morning.  They pulled out all the stops with whatever they were doing - they were singing, jumping, banging the walls, clapping, yelling - you name it..  It was extremely obnoxious, to say the least, but my girlfriend urged me not to say anything or do anything.  She didn't want to rock the boat or end up getting hurt.  Saturday night they started their shit up around the same time and were even louder.  This time it sounded like they had a girl over because we heard screaming along with all the other usual noises.  After several hours of this, I finally convinced my girlfriend to at least let me call the apartment's after hours courtesy number and file a noise complaint.  We then agreed that we'd go to the leasing office Sunday morning to speak to the management about this.  Because of the layout of the units in the building, we didn't know the apartment number of the offending unit.  I went outside and tried to sneak around to see if I could see the number on the door without being seen.  I saw a door that had the porch light on that read ""3228"" and figured that was the door (any unit with a garage at this complex has their front door on the ground level and an internal stairwell that leads up to the main living area on the second floor).

At around 2:30 am, we call the emergency number and speak to an operator.  She said she send somebody out to tell them to quiet down.  3:30 am rolls on by and the noise is still going on and I haven't seen anyone come through to shut them up.  I call the number again and they assure me that the complaint has been filed and somebody would be out there to take care of it.  I was getting pretty pissed off and decided to start recording the noises from the bedroom so that we could have some evidence when we filled our formal complaint in the morning.  It was nuts - the neighbors were so noisy that I was able to record them without any problem through the walls.  I got a good seven minutes of it and figured that would be enough.  We finally fell asleep at five in the morning and they were still yelling and screaming at that time.

Finally, the next afternoon, we went to the leasing office as soon as they opened.  We asked to speak to the property manager or manager on duty and were quickly taken into their office.  We explained the situation and how long it'd been going on, etc.  We told her that we called to complain that night, but nobody went to do anything about it.  The manager said she apologized for this and would quickly handle it by serving the unit a noise notice.  After three noise notices, she could have them evicted.  She assured us that if there was any sort of retaliation, to let her know and we would be able to press charges and get the police involved.  I played the recording for her and she shook her head and again apologized profusely.  As she was filling out her complaint, she asked us what the offending unit's number was.  We told her it was 3228 and she looked puzzled for a moment.  She pulled out a big binder with maps and layouts of the entire complex and the units and she looked at where our unit, 3225, was.  She looked at the log of the prior night's emergency calls and saw that, sure enough, the security officer on duty went to unit 3228 to tell them to quite down.  The problem was that I had picked the wrong door - apartment 3228 is occupied by an old lady and doesn't share a wall with us.  I played the recording for the manager again and her face went pale.  At that moment, I didn't understand why.  I looked at the map and saw that the unit that had the noisy neighbors was actually unit 3227.  She asked us if we were sure about the noises and where they were coming from.  I was about to play the recording again for her, but she told me to stop.  She asked us to leave her office for a moment and she got on the phone.  

Elizabeth and I were confused as to what was going on, but we waited anyway.  The manager finally comes out of the office after about ten minutes on the phone, shaking and pretty pale.  There wasn't anybody living in apartment 3227 and there hadn't been for over the past two years.  She had sent one of the maintenance guys to check for signs of forced entry, but the unit was fine and all the locks and latches were still in tact.  Evidently there had been a pretty grisly murder-suicide event in that unit three years ago.",nosleep,theghostofabe,/r/nosleep/comments/fh139/building_32/

59,Pupil ,1297051717,"My friends woke me up this morning and made me get off the couch and go outside. They said it was a nice day. We went to a mound of grass out by the backside of the apartment complex. I walked up the hill backwards, watching the reflection of us in the wavy glass of the sliding doors. We were all just figures, black as sins that weren't ours. 

We sat down, leaned back and gripped the green blades and stared up. They couldn't see it. I didn't even ask them if they did. They all saw the sun beautiful and yellow bursting through our atmosphere. They don't feel the sand I bury my hands in on the ground. Can't see my families charred face down in the dirt, their clothes ashes trailing off into the wind. They know it happened but didn't see it.

They try to cheer me up, make fun of the things I hate and ex-girlfriends I've dumped. But they don't know the sun I see is black, blacker than anything I've ever seen before, and that I must find out why.

I'm grateful for them. How they took care of me after the accident, visited me in the hospital and snuck me a bowl of skittles, all red ones because I don't like how the other colors of the rainbow taste. I wish I could taste it now though. They keep me occupied. Shopping at the mall. A short movie. The zoo. But while they marvel at the polar bears in the tank I see the center of our solar system reflected where the bear puts its white head to the glass. It's gotten bigger.

That night I wake falling off the couch. I'm staring underneath the coffee table at a white sneaker. It's laces hang lazily at it's sides and I'm back on the ground, sand in my mouth and the smell of gas in the air. My mother screams and I hear my brothers clawing away from the wreck. My father kicks out the windshield of the U-haul and I see all our photographs, couches and tables spilling out the back. My hand rests on the shoe and it's owner giggles. Innocent and pure. I hear the flick of a lighter and the air catches on fire.

I'm alone outside when the sun rises in the morning, my friends still drooling on the floor beside beer bottles. The earth spins it into view and it's ten times larger than the day before; empty as void, I can feel its gravity try and lift me off the ground. It crushes  my bones, starting at my toes and shifts them up, shattering my femur, spine then ribs as my skull collapses down and it all hardens around my heart. 

We go to the grocery store. All the fruits and vegetables look so alive under the lights glinting off the drops of sprayed moisture on their soft skin. I know they're all dead, rotting on a molecular level where decay sweeps in like a flood and eats everything alive, the smell of death heavy in the air. The flesh of my brother, sloughed off and in a ditch while the man in the fuel truck grabs the part where his leg used to be as he falls out of his door into the waterfall flowing from the 90 gallon, barrel-shaped gas tank. It makes a river to our overturned truck. Our overturned life. Flick.

We all wake up late and go to the park. The black sun is everywhere now.  It's bowed down and eclipsed the sky and every horizon. It hangs heavy and low, ready to pour down. I watch buildings crumble and fall on a couple pushing a stroller and they reassemble piece by piece, veins, blood and all. We make it to the pond and I can hear crying from above.

Hands stretch through the black fabric, reaching for me with knives, axes, hammers and finger nails. They will rip apart the shell around my soul. 

My friends walk off, smiling, hugging, laughing. Every step they take is one more in forgetting me forever. I step into the pond, cold and chilling, and wade out into its center. I stare up into the heart of the monster inflating towards me with one, single beat to swallow.

I remember it. The dirt beneath my nail as I got to my knees and took my hands off that shoe. The guilt I felt over starting the fire that burned our house down and led to our move, to the wreck just then kept me from standing. The guilt that set aflame the ones that gave me life and made it worth living.

As my family tried to swim through gas away from the truck I stared at the boy in front of me. The boy was me, smiling coyly and holding my grandfather's zippo lighter engraved: *All's Well that Ends Well*

The flick. The toss. The heat. The screams. I ignored them all and stared into the boy's eyes, my eyes. They were black, and I remember his pupils growing wide with pleasure as he dimmed the lights on their lives. They grew wider and wider, until they expanded out of his eyes, over his face and over the world to swallow me whole.

Then, *knock*. It was on a window of mine. And it was audible - louder than the radio. ""That can't be possible"", I thought, and so I shrugged it off.

Next week, I was at a cafe with my friends. Over political chit-chat and future-pondering, you could barely hear the conversation of the person next to you. *Knock*. It was just as loud as the first one, which I had completely forgotten. It rushed back to me, and brought the entire memory of my trip home. My brain began to pound against my head massively, as I screamed aloud.

Three days later I was admitted out of the hospital. Watching TV at my house, I tried to close my eyes and relax - I had been given two days off at work to deal with the massive headache. 

*Knock*.

It was on my TV screen - I felt it deep within my sync. When I got up to examine it. There was a crack. 

*Knock*.

All of a sudden, the cafe and the ride home weeks ago rushed to my head, as every second of every scene played simultaneously. It was too much - I blacked out.

A week later, I woke up in the hospital. The doctor told me I had fallen in and out of a coma repeatedly. I knew it was from that horrid beat. Strangely enough, the first nurse who had taken care of me, a good friend, wasn't there. I asked why.

""She had a pretty bad headache, not unlike yours. She's taken a day off.""

My temperature dropped, my brain froze. I had felt nothing at that moment but utter terror. The doctor sensed it. So did It.

It knocked.

I was out again, the memories flooding in. The doctor later committed suicide after explaining the knocking noise himself to his friend, who had suggested he go to a mental hospital.

*Knock*. 

Every day, it got worse. Soon enough, I was in the hospital permanently. I was fired. I had lost all contact with my friends - I couldn't put them through what I was experiencing. I had already infected one too many.

I didn't want an explanation; I just wanted it to stop. 

I couldn't help but grin at the last few days of my life. They were full of anger, terror, fear, docility. Empty mindedness. I have a better life now.

66,No more gaming by myself....,1297010312,"For Christmas, I got a Kinect. It was my only present from my family and it was perfect. I've got two younger sisters (five and three), and they too enjoyed the games for it. Perfect little bonding thing going on with them.

My room is tiny with my queen size bed taking up half of the space. With a little reorganization, I managed to get the required space to put up the kinect. It's a very tight squeeze when trying to play two player(near deadly when trying to play sports), but it is doable. 

A while ago, my boyfriend, sisters and I were playing Kinectimals. All sitting on the bed, because it's the most sense able place to be while watching/waiting to play next. The five year old was playing when the other wanted her turn, jumping into the game. The screen appeared that that showed the best place to stand so the kinect can tell where the player is, as well as a dot to show how much farther the player needs to back up.
There were the two moving dots close to the side where the bed was, my sisters freaking out about longer turns and sharing. And then there was one unmoving dot on the other side of my room, away from us all. At first, it was just annoying because the kinect wanted to pick up the unmoving dot as the main player. We didn't think much of it other than ""oh what a silly kinect. We're over here!"".

It wasn't until later that night my sisters had to go to bed, boyfriend and I played a few more rounds and he too had to leave. I left my kinect on, but started surfing the web on my laptop for a little while, causing my xbox to go idle. 
Again, I'm on my bed. Out of no where, the unmoving dot appeared. Same place. But no one was playing. This dot made my xbox become un-idle after about forty minutes of not interacting with it. That's when I started thinking something of it.

Keep in mind, my room is like a sandwich. When you walk in, it's literally closet, open space, bed. My closet is crammed with stuff from moving back in with my mom (books, clothes, toys, games) so I keep the doors closed so that my sisters don't take anything that's mine and hide it. How can my kinect pick up another player from inside my closet full of crap?

74,The camping trip,1296959805,"I was in my mid-thirties, and was on a camping trip in the Belgian Ardennes (hilly, lots of trees, open fields and rivers, medieval castles here and there, lovely small villages, great for walking and camping ...) 

It was becoming a tradition for us: every year in November, we brought out the trailer, took the tent off the attic, and went camping in this region. My wife, my ten-year old son, me, and my un-married brother.

This was our fourth year, and we had picked our camping spot based on the good and bad experiences of our past three campings: close to a river flow and to the city centre. Close to the lavatory block (but not too close either) and the main building.

It was a rather small caravan, with a table that was convertible to a double bed + a single hammock-bed above it; and with our two-person tent next to it. We usually didn't use the hammock. My son and wife slept in the double bed. Me and my brother in the tent.

It was Friday in the late afternoon, and it was an extremely windy day. We had just eaten dinner and I was in for a walk. My son was playing a game with my brother, my wife was doing the dishes, and neither of them felt for walking in that blazing, cold wind.

So I decided to go alone...

Seven o’clock. I went outside the caravan, and looked around. Found myself a nice hill not too far away, and decided to walk to the top of it. I got dressed with my thickest clothing, showed my relatives where I was heading for (just in case) and left the camping terrain.

When I was halfway up to the top, it started to rain. But I didn't want to pussy out. I was better than that! I had already set my target and I would sure-as-hell continue and reach the summit! Besides, I was wearing a good trench coat, multiple layers of clothing, stable walking shoes, had a woollen hat on my head and a nice warm shawl wrapped around my neck.

So I continued my way up, keeping a strong pace, following the slinky, empty path that zigzagged up the hill. It was nearing nine o’clock when I had finally reached my goal. (Rough guess, mind you: this was before the mobile-phone era and I didn't have a watch.) I was pretty sure my co-campers weren't too worried, as I had made long lonely walks before, but still... in this weather, I thought “I'd better hurry my way back.” It started to rain harder and it was getting really dark.

I stood there, on top of the hill, looked over the city for a few seconds, with the ice cold rain slamming in my face and the wind flapping the ends of my shawl like a flag. I looked down through the darkness of the trees and saw the lights of the road I had been following from our camping terrain to the base of the hill, peering through the branches, at about 150 meters below my feet. I took a deep, cold breath… and decided to take the short road. Straight downwards. The hill was extremely steep, but there were a lot of trees, small plants and rocks to hold on to, so I decided to just go for it.

After about ten meters (in a position that was a mixture of standing up and nearly lying on my back, supported by my heels and my hands -without gloves, why the hell didn't I bring my gloves with me?), I started to regret my decision, but now there was no way back.

I was going fast. Too fast to be comfortable, if there was a comfortable way to go down a hill like this. I felt rocks tearing apart the flesh of my hands as I tried to break the speed, holding plants, avoiding the big rocks,  trying to push my feet on the little rocks below me. That I had chosen the mossy side of the hill, and that the rain made this extra slippy didn’t help much. As if my current position wasn't crappy enough, the wind blew dirt and leaves in my face and the rain started pouring harder than ever. But I managed to keep a relatively stable position and focussed on finding the best path down the hill.

It was halfway down the hill when I heard it, coming from my right. A low monotone voice, slowly but certainly saying ""Hello...""

This was not the wind. This was not the sound of branches snapping, rocks falling or leaves brushing under my feet. This was a human voice, clearly audible, greeting me from about ten meters further away. Midway up a soulless hill, between nothing but bushes, trees, rocks and dirt.

I was scared like hell, a few cold chills ran down my spine, and I got goosebumps everywhere. But at this point, I couldn't process what I had heard. I couldn't think about a reasonable explanation. My brain needed all its processing power to keep focus on my adventure downwards if I didn't want to break a leg or end up in an even worse situation. I couldn't even throw a quick look into the direction it came from. And to be honest, I didn't even *want* to look.

The speed I was going downwards with now was almost insane and my brain almost hurt processing the information my eyes were registering, while my subconscious kept reminding me of what I had heard. Branches of low-hanging bushes and young trees slammed in my face. My pants were soaking wet. My feet were cold, my fingers frozen blue, with dirt and blood under my fingernails. But I wanted to be in the caravan as soon as I could. *I needed* to be in the caravan as soon as I could.

After a timespan that seemed to take ages, but was in reality probably less than a minute, I finally set my feet on the road. I looked over my shoulder for a brief second and sped off through what now had become hail, rattling on the road. It had become pitch dark except for the yellow light circles of the street lamps, and the lit windows in the city centre. Paranoid as if someone was chasing me, as fast as my sore feet could carry me. My feet and hands hurt like hell but I didn't give a damn. I wanted to be among other people.

Panting and sweating, heart pumping like a machine, I arrived at the caravan. I was a disaster. My wife looked up and down on me, and alarmed by the look in my eyes asked what had happened. I told her about the shortcut I had taken because of the weather, but didn't say a word about the voice I had heard. She would've just waved it off as ""one of my scary stories"" anyway.

After a cup of hot chocolate (glass of wine for my brother) and a game of 4-in-a-row with my son, I had calmed down a bit. I packed fresh underwear and my pyjamas, two towels and shower gel, got in my slippers and hastily made my way off to the sanitary block a bit further away. The hail storm was over but the wind wasn't going away anytime soon.

I entered the empty building, chose the third shower cell, got undressed, hung my plastic bags of clothes and towels on the pin at the inside of the wooden door, inserted two coins into the slot and pushed the button to start the warm waterflow. Only now did I find the time to really think about what had happened on that hill. While I was washing my hair, desperately trying to find an explanation for what I had heard, I heard the door of the sanitary block slowly creaking open.",nosleep,88scythe,/r/nosleep/comments/fg34p/the_camping_trip/

The first part can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ffmkk/an_incident_at_salton_sea/)


Within a few days of arriving back from the Salton Sea hunting trip, I had a very vivid waking dream.   I had gotten out of bed and the sun was shining in from the windows.  I walked out of my bedroom and started to pass my brother's room.  Behind the curtain, sitting on the window seal, was a crouched figure with what looked to be wings.  I quickly ran into the living room.  There was a bar that separated the living room from the kitchen.  On the bar, written in fire, was the name Galvian.  I ran out of the house, jumping off the porch.  I looked back and there was a darkness following me.   I ran down the street.  As I was running, a car pulled along side me.  The people in the car were telling me to go back home.  I refused and kept running.  Suddenly I was standing in the desert.  There was a small house in the distance, and black figures were flying out of it up into the air.  This dream was the beginning of it all.


Fast forward a couple of months.  I'm in school and sitting in an economics class with a pretty kick back teacher who'd let us work in groups on various projects.   In the back of the class there's a mexican girl who has brought an Ouija board to class.  A bunch mexican gangster types are standing around asking questions about people they've known who have died.  They were all flipping out because she was able to answer all their questions correctly with the Ouija board.  I go back to watch.  


After a while, I ask her if I can use it with her.  We had a family friend who died recently, so I asked to talk to him.  After a couple of questions, she lets go, and I'm the only one using the Ouija board.  I ask to speak with Galvian.  My hand started to turn noticeably purple, and started moving around in circles quickly around the board.  Someone asks why my hand is purple, and she says it's because a spirit is touching it.  My hand starts moving faster and is repeatedly spelling out '666'.  My hand is really purple, limp, and barely touching the pointer.


I ask who it was, and what it wanted.  It spelled out it was a demon and that I had ""fucked her in a dream"" and it wanted me to die.  I started to feel really weird at this point, and the bell rang.  The girl packed up her Ouija board and left.  I didn't use the Ouija board again for 4 years.  When I did though, things started getting pretty terrifying.  I'll post about that within the next week.

Anyway the paranormal research team is going to be coming to our house and farm since it's about 120 years old and there's a lot of weird stuff around our house.

On another note: A while ago I made a post called [""Two Columns""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eycmm/two_columns/) about UFOs and an encounter I had in the woods as a child (this was under the username ephellstrom). I won't say  what was  real or not, but I watched a show that I thought may have had shed some light on the ordeal. This guy was allegedly abducted for three hours and he  underwent regressive hypnosis and recalled all of it. Now, it could be all made up for TV or he could have been lying, but one thing he said is that the aliens he saw in the woods were actually the children of the ones in the ship and that ""they let them out to play.""

This really freaked me out. I was playing in the woods when I saw it; do you think it was one of their children trying to play with me, and if so, was it going to play nice?

87,An Incident at Salton Sea,1296880673,"This is the first part of a series of experiences that I had between the ages of 12 and 19.


In 1992, when I was 12, my stepfather and I went to [Salton Sea](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=salton+sea,+ca&amp;aq=&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=66.70144,134.736328&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Salton+Sea&amp;ll=33.347738,-115.528793&amp;spn=0.562688,1.31424&amp;t=h&amp;z=11), CA on a hunting trip.  Salton Sea is in southern California, inland towards the desert.  It apparently has a rich history, and was occupied by native Indians as early as [10,000 B.C.](http://www.saltonsea.ca.gov/about/history.htm)
  

We arrived around 5:00 a.m., looked around a bit, and then headed towards the registration office so we could rent some land to hunt on.  We fill out the paperwork, and then head to our acre of land.  After getting situated we basically spend several hours in a small clearing surrounded by brush, watching ducks fly too high overhead to hit with a shotgun.  At one point I accidentally fired my shotgun while I was holding it, only a foot or so from my stepdad's head.  I got a nice smack upside the head for that.


We decided to hunt separately for a couple of hours.  My stepdad left to go to another brush covering.  After 30 minutes or so, I got really bored as there were no ducks and I wasn't much of a hunter anyways,  so I laid down to take a nap.  Now this next part is a little weird, but it is relevant to the story.  I was looking up into the sky, and decided to masturbate.  Fine, okay, no big deal, but for some reason I started telling God to suck my dick.  I said it a few times and was soon done.  No idea why I said it, and it wasn't a thought I had before or since.  I drifted off into sleep…


I was probably asleep for an hour or so when I woke from a strange dream.  I dreamt of looking at an older camera at my grandmothers house.  Something was strange though, and the camera shot of the dream started to float up and out the window.  All black and paralyzed.  I was awake, but I couldn't move or open my eyes.  I started screaming in my head because I didn't know what was going on.  The paralyzation lasted for about a minute.  I snapped out of it, seeing my stepdad standing over me, leaning over.  He was covered in sweat and had a concerned look on his face. ""What the fuck just happened"" he asked.  I noticed I was covered in sweat as well.   Apparently he had came back while I was sleeping, and decided to take a nap as well.  ""I have no idea"" I replied.


Throughout the day we discussed what had happened, but we really had no explanation.  He thought maybe somehow far off gunfire had somehow made us extremely anxious while were sleeping. He didn't remember much, just that he'd woken up with his heart racing.
We decided to leave.  Shortly after starting to drive back, I fell asleep, and he fell asleep at the wheel.  Luckily he woke before we wrecked.   He decided it be best if we slept in the truck at a gas station.  We both slept for a couple of hours, and went home.


For the next six months, I slept with my door open and the light on, as I became plagued with sleep paralysis, and would wake up screaming several times a week.
I had many strange experiences laying in bed at night.  I would get close to sleep, when my body would freeze.  I was only able to move my eyes.  Sometimes I'd feel myself being pulled up into the air(one time broke from it and fell about an inch back onto my bed)  Other times I would just lie there frozen and feel a presence come into my room.  It was female and would sometimes laugh or whisper things.  I strongly felt after a while that I was being abducted by aliens.


Sometimes I'd know that it was going to happen after just getting into bed.  I could feel strange waves flowing over my legs and I'd get really freaked out and get out of bed.  HOLY FUCKING SHIT! I'm lying on the couch right now, writing this.  My front door JUST OPENED.  I heard it softly move, and felt a gust of cold air, looked over and it was open about two inches. 


Okay, I've calmed down a bit.  I went upstairs a couple of hours ago to grab some blankets.  My hands were full, so I must not have shut the door all the way.  But holy crap that was freaky.  I don't like to talk about this stuff too often, so that was bad timing!  It also probably doesn't help that I have The Hills Have Eyes playing in the background.  On with the story.


So like I was saying, this sleep paralysis would occur once every two weeks or so, and it lasted for about six months.  My mom had seen that I was troubled and decided to bring me to a non-denominational church called Calvary Chapel.  The first day I went was for a church picnic, and there was this really cute girl who was nice to me, so I started going to church to see her.  Eventually I became a Christian, and the sleep paralysis slowed in frequency.  When it did happen, I'd start praying like crazy and that seemed to help.


What's a bit freakier is that I have talked to my mother about it years later.  She told me that she would hear what sounded like little kids running around the house late at night, and that she'd hear the backdoor open and close sometimes.  (fuck that, my frontdoor opening was just a coincidence goddammit)  When she'd go to check on my brother and I, we'd be sound asleep.


Like I said, the sleep paralysis started immediately after the incident at Salton Sea.  What I didn't mention though, is a waking dream I had when the sleep paralysis first started, about a demon with a very specific name.  Later in life I'd come to communicate with this demon through the Ouija board.  I'll save that for next time.

89,Snorkeling in a pool.,1296872232,"I was born in California and lived there until I was 12. I lived about an hours drive from Monterey Bay, which you probably know as the location of the world famous aquarium. 
My dad took me to the aquarium when I was 11.  I fell in love with marine life automatically. It was so beautiful, peaceful even. Jellyfish were my favorite, the way they just kind of floated about, without a care. I wish life were that simple, haha.
Anyways, shortly after Monterey, my parents decided to vacation in Mexico in an effort to save their marriage. They decided to take myself and my sister with them. While in Mexico, I got the chance to snorkel (have you ever snorkeled? In Mexico? It's amazing!). I loved it, of course, and when we got back to the states, I insisted upon having a snorkeling set.
Now, my house had an indoor pool, installed by the previous owner because he had Parkinson's or something like that. I'm shady on the details, but what I do know is that my house had a freaking pool! In the immediate weeks that followed Mexico, all I would do was snorkel.
One day, I was snorkeling innocently around my pool when my snorkel got flushed with water. I don't know if you've ever had this experience, but it's not pleasant. I can't even describe it really...because you aren't paying attention, and it's your only breathing mechanism, it's like suffocation...but wetter. I don't know, that's not an awesome description, but it's all I can think of. Now, there was at least 15 feet from the edge of the pool to the door. There was only one way in and one way out- that door. The door was heavy and sliding glass, and squeaked horribly. When you got inside, it was a little tile room for you to change in or dry off or what have you. Then, there was an equally heavy wooden door, an old decaying one with semi squeaky hinges. Needless to say, there was no sneaking up on someone when they're in the pool. So I don't know what happened-I wasn't splashing, the water was still when I got up in it, and there was absolutely no one there. In fact, as I walked through the house accusing everyone, the closest person I even found was my sister, who was a floor below me. 
So, there's my weird story. Nothing else had happened before that that I remember, and I can't think of anything that happened after it either. ",nosleep,georgiamax,/r/nosleep/comments/ffkkg/snorkeling_in_a_pool/

On my 10th birthday I invited a bunch of friends over and my parents set up a tent in their back yard for us to sleep out in. The tent was an old style tent with two partitioned areas. The back was covered and opaque and the front half was just screen mesh. 

Late that night almost everyone was in the back part with a flashlight, and me and one other guy were up front talking. Out of the corner of my eye I see a light. When I turn to look I see an orb, roughly the size and shape of a football moving at about the speed an adult would walk. It was between me and the house and below the gutter on the 2nd story. It was roughly 20-25 feet away from me and perhaps 12 feet or so in the air. It would blink bright, and then wink out, disappearing completely (from my eyes anyway) It would then blink back in a few feet ahead, always travelling at roughly the same pace.

My friend and I both froze up, competely speechless. When it went out of sight, beyond the back of the tent we stared at each other and sprinted back and tried to rally the guys to help us go find whatever it was. We got out and I never saw it again.

93,Black threatening presence at a historical site,1296856101,"Here's something I have to say first: This is NOT a drug story. There was some alcohol involved, but not enough to have any sort of effect like this, and I trust everyone who was present enough not to think that they would slip me drugs of any kind. This is one of the factors that make this story so frightening. (Re-reading this before hitting the ""submit"" button, I realize how much like a bad Fortean Times sort of post this sounds. But it really happened to me.)

A couple years ago I went to a place called Asparn with some (neo)pagan friends. The Museum of Prehistory
 
there has an annual event called Lange Nacht der Feuer (long night of the fires) some time around the autumnal equinox. The open-air part of their museum, a jumbled-together celtic ""village"" (made up of houses from different historical periods) will be open for most of the night, and there are campfires and various shows and activities (story-telling, fire jugglers, ect.). We were sitting outside the museum in the middle of the night, at our own small campfire (on the site of a boy scouts house or something where we were staying), talking and drinking. I wasn't really drunk, maybe a bit tipsy (I would have noticed being really drunk, and besides I wasn't drinking anything ""hard"" that would have a sudden effect). Anyway, the first weird thing that happened was that while I was talking to a girl I'd just met I noticed that I was suddenly rambling on and on about my family history (especially about the women in my family - my mother, my grandmother, her mother even), going further and further into the past. It was uncontrollable and slightly creepy. Then a friend of mine came over to tell me something, and he touched me on the shoulder while I was drinking from a bottle of beer, which made the rim of the bottle knock against my front teeth. I jumped up and told him NO! repeatedly, in a loud voice, as if I really had to defend myself against some threat. Even while I was watching myself, I didn't know why I was doing that. And here comes the super creepy part: Not long after that, I got up and went to a small outhouse where I thought the loo was. The door didn't open, so I turned around, and one of my friends gesticulated to me from the fireside that I should try another door that I hadn't noticed before. I was only gone a couple of minutes, but away from the fire I suddenly felt weird. It wasn't a creepy feeling, just something unfamiliar, and hard to put into words. On my way back to the fire, I suddenly felt violently dizzy and I realized that I could hardly walk. I couldn't move my feet the way I wanted. I wasn't losing balance, I was kind of fighting to get back to the fire and my friends. This is when I started to feel creepy, and then everything started happening very fast. I saw a huge black shape rise out of the ground in front of me. It was towering over me, and I felt very threatened and cold and alone. It was as if it wanted to envelop me, and I felt powerless. I could hardly see. I crawled back to where I thought a very good friend of mine (a girl) was sitting and I said something like ""I feel so bad. Help me."" Later (after everything was over) I realized that I'd come to the guy I'd shouted at before, and he was nice enough to get that friend over for me too. So the two of them were sitting next to me, a bit apart from the others, trying to understand what was happening, trying to help me. I was on my hands and knees, and I still saw this menacing black presence looming over me. By that time I was sobbing, and I kept repeating, ""I just want to live. I just want to live."" That's when the guy started to tell me to fight back. Later he said he was trying to give me the will to kill whatever it was (I'm so opposed to violence). In the end, I visualized holding a knife in my hand and I stabbed and stabbed at whatever it was. Then I went and was sick. Five times. (Additional info: I was born 2 months early and had to be fed through a rubber tube for a time, which kind of forked up my gagging reflex. Normally I can't be sick, however bad I might want to. It's not pleasant.) Another friend, a historian, later told me some facts about the history of the place and about various peoples coming through that region at different points in time to wage war and raid and whatnot. She said it was almost logical that there'd be ghosts of people who were killed there a long long time ago. I'll never find out what it was or what really happened to me, but it was bad.

97,Barbie Dolls and other toys...,1296847834,"I was never unfortunate enough to experience anything that couldn’t be explained, though I keep an open mind and my girlfriend’s tale spooked me.  

It occurred when she moved into a house in Nevada City, California when she was a child. Her mother was a single parent and the two of them never stayed in one place for too long. When they found a house, it was small but affordable and they were eager to move in. Almost immediately, unusual things began happening. 

For one, their cat, which was described to me as always warm and unafraid of company, would never leave from under my girlfriend’s bed. It would stay there for the next couple months darting its head about as if it saw something no one else did. It would hiss at the air and it got so bad that eventually they put its litter box and food dish at the side of the bed so that it wouldn’t have to come out at all. 

Another eerie happening occurred when her mother angrily confronted her about ripping the heads off of the Barbie Dolls she spent so much money on. The only problem was that my girlfriend loved her Barbies and was upset at their headless remains scattered about her room.    

Months passed, they weren’t in the house a year before her mother got another job opportunity in a neighboring city. The two of them left that place and the bizarre things that happened came to be forgotten. 

Forgotten until a middle-aged woman came to her mom’s worked, asked for her by name, and proceeded to pose questions about the house. She was an investigative reporter hired by the family that lived there now; they were experience what could be best described as paranormal activity. She had done her research, learning that a young boy who had lived there in the seventies had been hit by a car crossing the street in front of the house and killed instantly. 

She asked what sort of things had happened to the family…

Apparently, when they had friends over for dinner one night, they were shocked to hear thuds coming down the staircase. When they approached it, a dozen or so of their child’s toys were making their way down the steps as if pushed by some invisible force. When they came down to the last steps, they veered off into different directions. It could have been the children playing at the top of the stairs; only they were at the dinner table too.

98,Black threatening precense at a historical site,1296847613,"Here's something I have to say first: This is NOT a drug story. There was some alcohol involved, but not enough to have any sort of effect like this, and I trust everyone who was present enough not to think that they would slip me drugs of any kind. This is one of the factors that make this story so frightening.
(Re-reading this before hitting the ""submit"" button, I realize how much like a bad Fortean Times sort of post this sounds. But it really happened to me.)

A couple years ago I went to a place called Asparn with some (neo)pagan friends. The [Museum of Prehistory](http://www.urgeschichte.at/content-en/the-museum/prehistoric-adventure) there has an annual event called Lange Nacht der Feuer (long night of the fires) some time around the autumnal equinox. The open-air part of their museum, a jumbled-together celtic ""village"" (made up of houses from different historical periods) will be open for most of the night, and there are campfires and various shows and activities (story-telling, fire jugglers, ect.). We were sitting outside the museum in the middle of the night, at our own small campfire (on the site of a boy scouts house or something where we were staying), talking and drinking. I wasn't really drunk, maybe a bit tipsy (I would have noticed being really drunk, and besides I wasn't drinking anything ""hard"" that would have a sudden effect). Anyway, the first weird thing that happened was that while I was talking to a girl I'd just met I noticed that I was suddenly rambling on and on about my family history (especially about the women in my family - my mother, my grandmother, her mother even), going further and further into the past. It was uncontrollable and slightly creepy. Then a friend of mine came over to tell me something, and he touched me on the shoulder while I was drinking from a bottle of beer, which made the rim of the bottle knock against my front teeth. I jumped up and told him NO! repeatedly, in a loud voice, as if I really had to defend myself against some threat. Even while I was watching myself, I didn't know why I was doing that.
And here comes the super creepy part:
Not long after that, I got up and went to a small outhouse where I thought the loo was. The door didn't open, so I turned around, and one of my friends gesticulated to me from the fireside that I should try another door that I hadn't noticed before. I was only gone a couple of minutes, but away from the fire I suddenly felt weird. It wasn't a creepy feeling, just something unfamiliar, and hard to put into words. On my way back to the fire, I suddenly felt violently dizzy and I realized that I could hardly walk. I couldn't move my feet the way I wanted. I wasn't losing balance, I was kind of fighting to get back to the fire and my friends. This is when I started to feel creepy, and then everything started happening very fast. I saw a huge black shape rise out of the ground in front of me. It was towering over me, and I felt very threatened and cold and alone. It was as if it wanted to envelop me, and I felt powerless. I could hardly see. I crawled back to where I thought a very good friend of mine (a girl) was sitting and I said something like ""I feel so bad. Help me."" Later (after everything was over) I realized that I'd come to the guy I'd shouted at before, and he was nice enough to get that friend over for me too. So the two of them were sitting next to me, a bit apart from the others, trying to understand what was happening, trying to help me. I was on my hands and knees, and I still saw this menacing black presence looming over me. By that time I was sobbing, and I kept repeating, ""I just want to live. I just want to live."" That's when the guy started to tell me to fight back. Later he said he was trying to give me the will to kill whatever it was (I'm so opposed to violence). In the end, I visualized holding a knife in my hand and I stabbed and stabbed at whatever it was. Then I went and was sick. Five times. (Additional info: I was born 2 months early and had to be fed through a rubber tube for a time, which kind of forked up my gagging reflex. Normally I can't be sick, however bad I might want to. It's not pleasant.)
Another friend, a historian, later told me some facts about the history of the place and about various peoples coming through that region at different points in time to wage war and raid and whatnot. She said it was almost logical that there'd be ghosts of people who were killed there a long long time ago.
I'll never find out what it was or what really happened to me, but it was bad.

99,Stepmothers make everything better,1296846574,"When I was young I had a stepmother that constantly watched after me and ensured that I didn't get hurt. She was a very kind lady, but there was always something off about her. She insisted that I clean my plate like most parents do, however there always seemed to be much larger portion for me than anyone else in the family. This mostly occurred after my father lost his job and they were having problems coming up with money to feed everyone. 
 
One night after a particularly large dinner I was lying in my bed and began to notice a thumping sound coming from my closet. At first I figured it could be the pipes from the bathroom that was on the other side, but the thumping kept persisting. Staring at my closet I saw the light click on inside and could make out the shadows of something stirring within. Most would figure that my mind was playing tricks on me with an overly full belly, but it was very vivid, very real. 
 
The closet door opened slowly and a small head popped out from the bottom. It was the head of a small doll that had came from my sister's room. I couldn't make out why this had happened, I only knew that the light was now off and this head had rolled out. I began to get scared and my breathing intensified when I saw a large hand reach out of the closet and clasp the head of the doll. ""Come play with us"" I heard it whisper. 
 
I began to scream and yell and threw the covers over my head when I heard my bedroom door open. I pulled the covers from over my head to see my stepmother standing in the doorway. ""What's the matter?"" she said with a slight smirk on her face. I told her about what I had seen and pointed to my closet to find it closed and nothing around it. 
 
""Don't worry about that sweety,"" she said as she walked slowly out of the room and as she closed the door, the last things I heard from her was, ""the poison we put into your food tonight sometimes causes hallucinations before it takes effect. See you at breakfast.""",nosleep,trisight,/r/nosleep/comments/ffcxv/stepmothers_make_everything_better/

Anyway, I felt something on or around my hand, some sort of pressure, but really gentle. And as I opened my eyes, I indistinctly saw something let go of my hand and quickly move away from me, ducking behind the bedside table. About the size of a small child.

1,Animal ghosts,1296844936,"A friend told me this story: Everyone who entered the last flat she lived in would be convinced she had a cat. People (including her) would instinctively leave doors open or see a small shadow rounding a corner out of the corner of their eye. Sometimes visitors would ask her about her cat, what it was called etc. Thing is: she didn't have a cat. But she knew perfectly well what they were talking about, since she'd constantly notice its precence, too. Apparently, when she moved house, the cat spirit stayed behind and is now haunting the next tenants.

In my old flat, my cat Neko would always watch invisible things running around in my bedroom. Only in the bedroom. She'd sit there, following something around with her eyes, ears, body movements. Sometimes she'd run after it and jump to a spot on the carpet that was empty to my eyes, as if she was trying to catch something. Once she ran up to the wall and jumped up with all four paws. There was no spot, no reflection, nothing. People have been suggesting she could have been hunting the ghosts of my pet rats.

3,Ghost Radar,1296835116,"Have any of you ever played with that little smartphone app called Ghost Radar? I always thought it was just entertainment...until last night.

It was about two in the morning and I was on my laptop, perusing nosleep and other subreddits and their associated links and comments. I had my Android phone plugged into my computer to charge. The app had been showing random blobs of light on its radar supposed to be entities, and had spewed a random word here and there during the night.

Things got weird suddenly. One of the words it spoke was ""Egypt."" I had just been reading an article about the uprisings in Egypt. Jokingly, I told it to say ""midnight"" or ""nightmare"" if anything was around. It didn't, but it did manage to say ""black"" shortly after that, which was mildly off-putting since it was so close.

It said a bunch of other random, seemingly unrelated words like Chicago, driving, memory, condition, and hospital, and then close to three it suddenly said ""hall."" I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise suddenly. There's a short hallway behind me in the apartment that leads to the second bedroom and bathroom. I looked down at the radar and one of the blobs was directly behind me. Thinking how silly this was, I got up to check in the hallway. There was nothing, but my entire body was covered in goosebumps and it was really, really cold in there.

I went back to my computer and turned off the app. That was enough for one night. I don't need to start thinking my phone can communicate with the dead...",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/ff8u5/ghost_radar/

5,Exploring the Forest,1296813653,"  Let me start by saying that I'm very interested in the paranormal, not sure whether I 100% believe or not, but ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Wrong Turn"" type of shit is a whole different story. People and what they're capable of is the scariest thing of all.

  This past summer, my roomate, boyfriend and I decided to go explore the forests in and around Lake Tahoe for the day. We went down to Markleeville, and decdied to head up hwy 4 twards one of the bigger ski resorts (Bear Valley i believe). Well after a few trails and exploring we decided to head back twards Markleeville to get home. 

  I decided I would drive back. As we were driving down the highway I spotted a Jeep trail I thought would be promising. The trail was marked with one of those Forest Service posts that said it's difficulty and what kinds of vehicles could handle it, which ours could, so i decided to detour and go take a drive up it. About a 1/4 mile up, there was a giant tree that had fallen across the road. We all got out and inspected. To the right of the log and stump of where the tree once stood there was a ""trail"" from where a few vehicles had gone around it in the past (I did not pay attention to how it was cut/fallen). I decided to go around because i really wanted to take my new (10 month old) truck on some semi-real 4x4ing. After going around the log, the trail seemed to have not been traveled on for a few weeks, which i found strange. The trail was pretty rough, definitely required 4x4. 

  As we were driving down this slope (careful not to get the new truck scratched I'm not gonna lie), around a slight bend in the road we notice there is a really old cabin with a white, early 90's model Ford Explorer parked on the side. We all thought it was slightly strange because it appeared as though no one has driven this trail for several weeks. As we approached this cabin we noticed a red fuel can and some trash sitting between the Explorer and the cabin, and the cabin itself had all of its windows, shutters and doors open, but inside it was completely black. As we were about 25 yards away from the cabin, We could see down the road that there were large pieces of wood sitting about 50 FT on the other side of the cabin blocking the road and stopping any vehicles moving further. At this point we are all a little freaked out, So I turn the car into reverse and back up into this little turn out area about 25 feet behind us. Upon entering the turn out, we realize there is spot where there had previously been a bonfire and about 10 feet behind it was a fairly large rock, which i kid you not, was covered in blood stains. Obviously, after the rock, and all the road obstacles, I high tailed it out of there without a care whether or not my truck got scratches. 

  Although this story may not be ""scary,"" it is a really creepy 100% real experience I wanted to share. I kind of want to find that trail again and see what was really going on, but the road obstacles really make me think whoever lives/stays there is not the least bit friendly. What would have happened had we of driven down to the Logs blocking the road in front of the cabin? The weirdest part is it was marked as a legitimate Forest Service road.

9,"Just read ""Five days at the Lake."" post, it reminded me of this creepypasta.",1296797923,"I've never really been a believer in the paranormal and I always try to find a rational explanation for things that I have trouble working out, at least until last summer. Originally from New Jersey, I decided to take my wife and kids for a vacation. We went to visit my in-laws who have a cabin in the Canadian Rockies.

For the first few days, we enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the country and went on a bunch of hikes and bike rides in the forest around the cabin, during which I didn't see anything out of the ordinary in what must have been a 20 mile radius around the home.

The cabin is pretty old and runs on a separate generator near the tool shed in the back of the yard which my father-in-law says has always been temperamental and can create an eerie atmosphere when the lights flicker on and off, so I know better than to be spooked by shadows and bumps in the night.

However, one night (around 10pm) we were sitting around about to go to bed when the lights completely gave out and the pitch blackness of the countryside meant that we could see literally nothing. Before I could grab the flashlight, I heard rustling outside the cabin and something brushed the side of the wall by the living room. I tried to put on a brave face for my kids and told them that it was probably a coyote and they should just go to their room although from the noises it made, it sounded bipedal and quite a bit bigger.

Pretty creeped out, I grabbed my flashlight and headed out to the generator, shining the light on the ground to find my way. But out the corner of my eye I saw something which terrified me so much I don't know if I can even find the right words to describe it. I couldn't make it out exactly--all I could see was a creature in my peripheral vision. It looked human and about six feet tall with ghost white skin. I knew it was staring at me.

At this point, I was mustering up the courage to look at it and when I shined the torch at it, I got a good look at the monster. It's so difficult to portray with words but it looked like a man whose skin was too tight for his body; you could see all of his organs bulging through his skin and the bones made it look almost like an insect, with the lower arm extending further up the arm and the shin bones doing the same.

But what jolted me the most was the fact that it had no face whatsoever but still had indentations where the eyes should be. The bright light startled the creature and it hunched over as if about to run. This was all I could see in the brief glimpse I got before I dropped the flashlight in fright and by the time I picked it up it had darted into the forest.

I ran to the back of the cabin and stayed there for what seemed like forever making sure it had gone before I went back to the generator. I didn't tell anyone when I went back inside what I had seen and I don't really know why; I suppose to protect the children and in case my wife didn't believe me.

About a week afterwards I started having a recurring nightmare. Every night I would dream about that night and wake up in cold sweats until I finally confessed to my wife about it all and started seeing a therapist to help me with my sleeping.

16,The Midnight,1296784537,"Ever feel like your eyes are deceiving you? Ever felt like your ears are lying to you? Chances are, they're not.

That shade in the chair in your room late at night--that's me. The shadow that moved far too quickly to be real across the door into the next room, the whispering and breathing just over your shoulder--that's me. That feeling of dread you get when you enter a graveyard in the dead of night, the feeling of an electric chill on your heart when something isn't right in the mirror--that's me. The pair of eyes you see glinting between the trees in a forest, the strange shape running between tracks in the cornfield just before dawn--that's me. The man in your closet, the monster under your bed, the yawning chasm in the basement when the light won't light--me again. The footsteps in the hallway coming up to your room, the flicker of the lights at the wrong time, the terror that grips you as you hide horrified under the covers when you saw something that should not be--I am.

I am every nightmare you ever feared, every phobia that ever came true. I am the dead of night, the witching hour, the nadir of light. I am the darkness. I am the Midnight. Yes, the spawner of nightmares, the darkest desire and most horrible ghostly fright you can imagine--that's me.

When the clock strikes twelve, I am there. When the shadows change and the presence that cannot be seen moves upon you like an icy breeze, I am there.

You cannot close your blinds, hide under the covers, or even turn the lights on. It does no good, for even unseen, I am with you.

I am all that is night, darkness and pitch black. You might see me as a robed figure on a moonlit night, or as a fleeting shadow along the hallway wall. I might be the black mass floating over you in the wee hours of the morning. I might merely haunt you, or I might kill you.

I am the ghost that walks that lonely road, the figure that follows your car, and the death that comes for your soul.

I am a darkness beyond darkness. I am worse than death. I am the immortal nameless terror, the king of the night.

Soon you will hear my stories--of those I've stalked, of those I've destroyed, of those I've taken. And you will get to know me quite well. I might even tell of someone you used to know.

22,Creepy Experience,1296762664,"This happened a few years ago and my husband and I still occasionally bring it up. It absolutely happened just as I tell it. It freaks me out to talk about it so I thought it might be a worthwhile submission to /nosleep.

One night, I began dreaming of jogging up a hill where the majority of my family lived (my grandma, aunt, and four cousins all lived along this stretch of road). It was early morning in the dream, and I was jogging along, I noticed a man walking down the hill toward me. I was overcome with a sense of apprehension and I thought it was silly to fear this guy, but I knew everybody who lived on that road and this man was a total stranger. I quickened my pace, and suddenly noticed off to my right a lone public telephone where none was in real life. I angled toward the phone, hoping to get to it before he could reach me because I was suddenly and absolutely sure that this man was going to try to rape and kill me. I needed to get to that phone to call the police. I was trying to act nonchalant, hoping to not draw attention to what I was doing. I was worried he would figure out what I was up to and thwart my chances of calling for help. The man picked up his pace as well, and began running toward me as I broke out into a full run towards the phone. Just as I reached the phone, my fingertips glanced on the receiver and the man was there wrapping his hands around my throat. He was also pinching my nose shut and I was desperately trying to breathe and scream for help. He squeezes his hands tighter and tighter and I began to suffocate. I then blacked out in the dream. 

I awoke, choking and sobbing. I was terrified there was someone in our house. This is a little sleepy town, and so we slept with the windows open upstairs to have a breeze in the summertime. I was petrified however, and laid completely still, just listening as the adrenaline  surged through my system and I was totally freaked out. There was nothing to be heard: it was utterly peaceful and silent. I tried to wake up my husband but it was no use. Eventually I got up enough courage to creep over to my window to shut it quietly and lock it. I glanced at the alarm clock and it was around 3:30am. I then turned on the light in the hallway, snuck into my son's bedroom and checked on him. He was dead asleep too, so I checked the closet and closed his window and locked it. I then went through the house systematically checking the closets, behind the couch, anywhere that someone could possibly hide. It was empty.

I relaxed some, but the dream had a very intense feeling about it. It didn't *feel* like any other dream I'd ever had at all. It didn't have the dreaminess and the surreal quality that my dreams normally have once I awaken. I had this uneasy dread that just permeated my being. 

I tried to shake it off. I got a glass of water, turned on the television for company and read for a while. At about 4:10am, I decided to go try to get back to sleep and hopefully awaken in the morning without this sense of intense dread.

I crawled back into bed, and fell asleep rather quickly. Instantly I was having an intense and otherworldly dream again. This time, I was at my cousin's wedding that I had attended a few months prior. I was sitting at a table alone and my friend Kasey walked up and sat down. Now Kasey had not been at this wedding, in fact she didn't really know my cousin at all and so this was strange. I instantly gripped her arm and said, ""Kasey, I had this horrible dream and I think it was about you."" She kinda laughed but I was insistent. ""I want you to be very careful,"" I told her, ""I think someone has been watching you and I think they're going to hurt you."" Kasey shrugged it off, told me it was just a dream but I grabbed her harder and began begging her to take it seriously. The dream ended with me in tears saying, ""Promise me you'll be careful. Promise me you'll lock your doors and windows!! Please!"" 

I awoke straight out of the dream. At this point I was like *WTF? Why did I dream that? There was no mention of Kasey in the first dream at all, why was I so sure it was about her?* I am really freaked out, look over and it's about 4:45am. Rather than attempting to go back to sleep after the strange and disturbing dreams, I just got up and went downstairs to start the day early.

The sense of dread never left the entire day. It was disturbing me a lot. I told my husband my dreams when he woke up, but it didn't make the sense of dread better at all. I went throughout the day with it hanging over me while I did the grocery shopping, made dinner, etc. 

In fact, the dread was very unnerving. My husband was working the third shift and then he went to school in the evening before his shift started, so I was alone at around 5pm. I grabbed my son and headed over to my mom's, which was a couple of miles from my house, just to have some company.

When I got to my mom's house, she wasn't home yet so I just played with my son for a bit. She got home, we started chatting about her day at work, the weather, etc. In the middle of shooting the breeze, she stopped and said, ""Oh, did your grandma call you?"" No she had not, and I asked my mom why she would have as I saw my grandmother often so we didn't talk on the phone much at all. ""Well, this morning right after your cousin Kyle left for his job, someone broke in and tried to rape his wife Casey.""

I nearly fainted. Literally. The room spun and kind of paled and I heard my mom say, ""Oh shit!!!"" and felt her grab me and sit me down. My cousin Kyle is a twin, and his twin's name is Chris... it was Chris' wedding I had dreamed about. It was Chris' wedding where I had begged my friend Kasey (with a ""k,"" the only difference between the two girls' names) to watch out. The hill I had been jogging up in the first dream? Right at the top of that hill was my cousin Kyle's house where the attempted rape occurred. Then my dream made sense and as I told my mom my dream as well as I could while flipping the fuck out, she blanched and called my grandma for further details. 

Kyle had left work at 4:30am, and Casey had fallen into a light sleep on her living room couch only to be awakened by a man on top of her, choking her. She struggled to reach the phone, only just out of her grasp, and before she could reach it she blacked out. The assailant apparently left before raping her. No one is sure why. And I had my initial dream approximately one hour before this occurred, and the second dream about the time it was happening. This still gives me goosebumps until this day.",nosleep,sillystingray,/r/nosleep/comments/fepb0/creepy_experience/

I sleep in the guest room at my grand parents' house.  For some reason they have a small wind chime on the inside of the window next to my bed.  Right before  I fall asleep I hear water dripping from inside the room every 5 seconds or so

drip...


drip...


drip...


and then it stops...


I don't think much of it and begin to fall asleep.  Now, it was really windy last night in my area so as I was drifting of I could hear the wind as it varied getting louder and softer.  Then, it starts to Blow reaaaaaalllly hard and...


BAM!


I open my eyes and I hear the wind chime(which is inside the room) moving back and forth for a few seconds.  It kind of sounds like this:

Creepy right?


I shake off my nerves and go back to sleep.  When I wake up I check the window to see if it was cracked, but it was locked.  The window can't lock unless it is fully closed.  I check around the cracks to see if I can feel any cold air coming through but don't.

26,A nosleep dream,1296726768,"I haven't had vivid dreams, for quite a while, and I believe my insatiable appetite of nosleep has caused me to see things and dream of things I thought were not possible.

Please bear with me, this isn't overly scary but still shook me out of my sleep.
So in my dream:

I am in an apartment, nearly all white with long white curtains waving in the wind.  I can see a balcony with a door slightly ajar to my left.  Nothing unusual I would say.  I am standing at one of end of the corridor. At the other end of the corridor is the bathroom, and as I enter the room I could swear I saw something.  Behind the shower curtain was an eye, like an Egyptian eye.  At this point I freaked out and left the bathroom.                               

I kept entering the bathroom several times, and peaked at the shower curtain and the eye was still there looking at me.

But the last time I entered, there next to the eye was a small little baby doll with pink underwear.  I grabbed it. I could feel something. Someone else was in the apartment. I didn't know who it was and what it was, but I wasn't scared.  I then turned around and then I freaked.

For on the floor, was now another baby doll, with blue underwear.
All of a sudden I woke up in the dark and was relieved.
 
Until I looked across the room.  There lay a baby doll looking at me.

30,Summoning suicide pop,1296695926,"Posted a while back about prospects of playing the midnight game on LSD but on the planned night my dad committed suicide.  I thought better of opening myself to the psychological dangers of LSD so soon after his death which was by turns shock and intense grief.  However, because I've only ever experienced a profound feeling of wholeness when I've used LSD I've decided to plan a ceremonial evoking ritual to summon my dad's spirit as the Midnight Man.

I'd like your suggestions on facets of the summoning ritual.  I'll be editing to add my incantations, candle arrangements, blood toll, etc. etc. - if you have any ideas, pipe up!  I'm going Roman and welcoming all useful input.  I'm especially interested in the prospect of invoking the Day Man at a certain point in the traditional Midnight Game ruleset in order to dispel my father's eternal soul and free him from samsara.",nosleep,abindigo,/r/nosleep/comments/fe6ol/summoning_suicide_pop/
31,Strange (and stupid) Occurrence After Sleep Paralysis,1296682506,"I'm in a writing mood today. I figured I'd share a really weird, and kind of stupid story that happened to me about a month or so ago. 

I'm not a good sleeper (semi-insomniac, frequent interruptions, etc.), and I tend to have sleep paralysis occurrences often (almost one every 2 months or so I'd say).

These always freak me out, but I've sort of gotten used to them. Anyway, so my latest one was pretty typical. I was in my bed, half asleep, when I very clearly heard my bedroom door opening very slowly. You know it's happening when you hear the bottom of the door sliding across the carpet, it makes that staticy sound. I started to panic, but couldn't move to actually see it happen....and then I heard very slow, very soft footsteps moving toward my bed. The sounds of someone who knows you're asleep and is trying not to wake you up; someone sneaking in...

My heart was racing, I could feel the presence of someone or something right over my bed. I entered ""fight or flight"" mode, when suddenly I broke out of the paralysis (by actually kicking my leg a little). As soon as I broke out, I saw the door wasn't actually open, no one was actually in the room, etc. Everything was as it should be.

The next day, I went to turn on my PS3, and it wouldn't boot. No lights were on. I immediately worried that I was going to have to pay for repairs, and went to investigate the console.

My console is in an entertainment system cubby, so only the front of it is exposed...I pulled the console forward, and found that all of the cables in the back had been pulled out. The power, and the HDMI. I plugged them back in, and it worked fine...but then I noticed that the USB keyboard that I had plugged in to the front of it was also disconnected. 

I have no idea if the two incidents are related, of course, and I told you it was a pretty stupid occurrence in the beginning of the story...but I truly cannot explain this. I live alone, by the way, and to unplug those back cables you would have to pull the console out of its cubby and tug them with your hand. 

Anyway, I hope reading this wasn't a waste of your time (I know it's not that creepy). 

I'm not really even a strong believer in ghosts or spirits or anything, but if anyone has any sort of similar experiences or possible explanations (no matter how spiritual or crazy), I'd definitely be interested in hearing it.

32,Strange Dream I Had About Freddy Krueger,1296674401,"So, I don't usually like to tell dream stories, because they're usually gibberish and no one really cares about other people's dreams...they're usually only scary/personal to the person dreaming them...however, I think this one is kind of worth telling. It's kind of humorous, but also kind of creepy.

I won't go into long drawn out details, but pretty much the basis of this dream was that I was in my house minding my own business, I tihnk I was trying to find something, when suddenly Freddy Krueger appeared. 

As stupid, or funny, as that sounds; sure enough, Freddy was in my house, in my dream, and he wanted me dead. What followed was that panic feeling you get in your stomach during scary dreams, the feeling of impending doom, that you're JUST about to be caught by the predator. And as he's chasing me around endlessly, I suddenly realize: this is just a dream. 

It has to be a dream, especially if Freddy Krueger is here! So I stopped running, and yelled at him: You're not real! I'm dreaming, you're just a dream! 

But he lunged at me again and the panic feeling didn't go away and I had to keep running. He was still coming, he still felt real. 

And he laughed, and this is what he said: 

You're not dreaming me, I'm dreaming you. You're in my dream, and here, I have all of the power.

Upon waking up, I realize it's just a dream....but, even awake, that statement really creeps me out. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/fdzj5/strange_dream_i_had_about_freddy_krueger/
33,Couldn't sleep-in even if i wanted to,1296673062,"I woke up today at 5:30am because the school was calling to say we had no school. I ran downstairs to get the phone, closing my bedroom door behind me. After listening to the pre-recorded message over the phone, i returned upstairs to sleep. I dont know if it was just because it was early and i had just woken up, so i thought i closed the door, but the door was wide open. I returned to my bed, and tried to go back to sleep, but i had this feeling i couldn't shake that someone was watching me. I began to hear some breathing noises coming from somewhere in my room (i am positive it wasn't a famly member.) I rolled over in my bed so i was facing the wall (rather than my room) and i had a strong urge to turn around/ that something was standing over me.   I felt something brush the back of my neck, then it was gone, the breathing and the uncomfortable feelings. Bad way to start the morning.

34,Glasses,1296668505,"If anyone here is from New England, like me, they're probably aware of the large snow and ice storms that closed public schools in the area.  Days like that always remind me of an experience I had on a snow day a few years ago...

Knowing that the next day was a snow day, I had stayed up late reading.  When I got tired sometime after midnight, I put the book down, rested my glasses on top of it, and fell asleep.  Being a high school student with no commitments the next day, I decided to take the liberty of sleeping in until about ten-thirty in the morning.  I left the radio on while I slept, so I woke up to gray light streaming through my window and the local rack station blaring.  I was the only one home, since my parents still had work and my sister's college had not cancelled.  After laying in bed for a few moments, I reached for my glasses and found nothing.

Now, I'm severely nearsighted, so without my glasses, I can only see with any real definition for about seven inches; after that point, I can only make out basic shapes of objects.  I can see that my book is on the floor, so I assume I must have bumped into my nightstand and knocked the book, and thus my glasses, to the floor sometime during the night. It's not uncommon; if you were to watch me every morning for a month, this same thing would probably happen 20 out of the 30 days.  Sighing, I get out of bed and onto my hands and knees to search for the glasses, which, naturally, are nowhere near the book.

I had been searching for about a minute when I first heard a noise.  It was barely audible over the radio, just a single, soft, *hee*.  Now, being that I only heard the noise for a second, I didn't even pause; I just assumed it was radio static and kept looking.  After another thirty seconds or so, I heard it again: *heeheeheeheeee*.  Unsure what the sound was, I reached up and turned the radio down.  I waited for a little bit but didn't hear anything, so I kept looking.

After a little while longer, it occurred to me that they might be under the bed.  I put my head under the side board and, finding that there was too much of a shadow to be able to see my black frames, I began to pat around the floor like a blind man, keeping my eyes on the floor.  It was then that I heard an quiet, muffled *snicker*.  Uneasily, I raised my head to look all the way across the floor under my bed.

I can't describe it well, as I didn't have my glasses on and I only looked for a second, but across the bed from me, laying on its torso, was a human figure.  Its forehead was too large, and there was an indent where its nose belonged, like on a skull.  The part I'm certain of, however- the part I'll never forget- was its teeth. Even without my glasses, I could see that they were wrong; some were sharp, some were square, but the certainly all didn't fit in its mouth.

I screamed.

Within a few seconds, I was in my kitchen, holding a chef's knife and breathing hard, waiting for it to crawl out of my room.  After about fifteen minutes of waiting with my back to the wall, I began to walk towards my room.  With more effort than I've ever had to exert since, I got myself to get back on my knees and look under my bed.  Nothing.  After checking every corner of the room, as well as my closet, I sighed and sat on my bed.  It was then that I noticed my glasses, neatly folded and placed in the center of my pillow.

35,A mysterious sickness,1296643753,"On monday, the day before yesterday, I went to work in the morning as usual. I biked the same route to work, at the same time, on the same bicycle, as I have every day in the past two years. I drank the same coffee, dispensed from the same coffee machine, out of the same cup, as I have every day in the past two years. I checked my email, I checked Reddit, and I started work, the same way as I have every day in the past two years.

I'm 27 years old.

I started to feel a bit nauseous, so I went to the bathroom to clear my head. Once there, I found I was *very* nauseous, and wanted to puke, but I couldn't. I wanted to go back to the office to have somebody drive me home, but I couldn't manage to get out of the bathroom stall. My balance was shot so I couldn't walk or stand. I tried puking again and again, but my body refused to.  I started losing my balance even when crouched down or seated, and my head hit the bathroom wall with a hollow **thunk**. 

**Thunk**, **thud**, *groaaan*,  **thunk**, **THUNK**, *uuuuughhh*...

A colleague heard the noise, came in, and helped me up and out of the bathroom. He plunked me into a chair. I couldn't talk. I could see, I recognized faces, but there was no meaning. People asked me questions, and I couldn't answer them. I tried to form words, but I don't know if the words made sense. Doesn't matter, because my mouth didn't make the right sounds anyway. 

An ambulance was called. I remember the stretcher, the cold outside air, and the rivets in the metal side or ceiling of the ambulance. 

In the hospital: more questions, I don't want to answer. It's so hard. I keep drifting off. The doctors snap their fingers in my face and slap my cheeks to keep my attention. It doesn't work. They take vial after vial after vial of blood for testing. They catheterize me for a urine sample. They keep asking questions, shine flashlights in my eyes, and keep prodding. They're so pushy - if they just gave me a chance to gather my thoughts... but my thoughts drift off to oblivion...

I wake up, and the world is a little less confusing. Talking is still difficult, but I *think* I know when I don't make any sense and have to try again. 

I steadily feel better. The doctors come back around lunch-time the next day. Must be tuesday, because I was admitted on monday.  A team of 6 doctors form a semicircle around my bed, and look down upon me. I ask them if they know what the problem is.

They don't have the slightest idea, not even a plausible theory.

36,My house is driving me crazy.,1296636741,"I've lived here for around, what, 4 years now? Something like that. For some backround, part of my house was built by my great grandma, the rest added on by the family that moved in after she died (she didn't die in this house, she died two doors down at my grandma's house) and by the gentleman that moved in after the family moved out. 

Nothing really has ever happened in this house. I mean, other than in the original part of the house, which suffers from old house syndrome, the house is super quiet. Lately though, I've woken up anywhere from 2-4 am, for seemingly no reason. Like clockwork, 5 minutes after I wake up, weird sounds go through my walls. I don't know how to explain it, kind of like the sound of running a cup over metal bars, but softer than that.
Then, when I go to sleep again, I have the **weirdest** dreams. Last night's dream was kind of like a bad acid trip; the sky was like, streaming in different colors at a fast speed with clouds coming in too. I was in a forest, and I'm looking around. I look up, see a random woman with long hair and pale skin lean toward me and say, ""It's time to wake up now."" Of course, I wake up right when she says that haha. Too creepy for me.

All was going well, taking a few pictures and making sketches  until we were asked if we could go down to the basement. on most occasions it'd be tough to stop me going down there but I was filled with a sense of sudden dread so decided against it. most of the others go down and I decide to sketch this organ...then the moment, that as I type now makes me shiver thinking back. laughter. inhuman high pitched, unnatural laughter.

48,Mary [first post],1296560735,"A few friends and I heard of this place called Mary's Grave right in town. Apparently it was haunted this said 'Mary' and we heard all types of rumors. Some about how she would sit in her playhouse and mutilate animals until her father found her. Others would be about her father touching her until she told someone  and was killed by the same man. The rumors are endless and not many people know which is the truth. All the rumors lead to the same back story in which she was hung and killed on her family's property. 

So my friends and I decided to check this place out. We checked online for any directions or any addresses. After not much luck, we asked around town to see if anyone knew where it was located. Finally we found out where it was and proceeded to drive down a dark, windy road. In my '95 Ford Explorer, we rolled up and down the hills at around two in the morning blasting music, pumping ourselves up. After about 15 minutes of this eerie, dark road we hit a sign that pointed us left, or right. The man who we had asked, told us to make the right at the end  and we proceeded to do so. He also mentioned the location of the house in relation to Mary's grave which was located just up the street on the water. 

As we passed the huge house on the water, we all glanced at the tree in the shadowy darkness. We assumed it was the tree she was hung in and we all began to get the chills. At this point I had slowed my car down and paused my iPod (leaving my speakers on). As we continued down the street, we rounded a turn and at that exact moment the loudest sound came over the old speakers. It was a thumping sound. Which had the rhythm of a slow beating heart. Everyone in the car could feel each other tense up and begin to get nervous. I quickly jumped to lower the speakers to stop the sound of the beating heart. 

We now could see the outline of what remained of the grave. Just walls made of stone. We neared the end of the street to park the car. As we did so, the girls in the car refused to go outside. My friend and I agreed that we would go check out the grave to see if we could see and 'ghosts' or have the wits scared out of us. We began to walk with our flashlights, seeing nothing. After about 15 minutes of searching and walking around the  grave, we found nothing. No ghosts, no old dolls, noting. So we walked back to the car to find the girls terrified in the car. We asked what was wrong but they insisted that it was only the creeps of the place. 

We ended that night unsuccessful without spotting and ghosts or unusual occurrences, except for the heartbeat. 

The next night I decided to go back with the one friend who joined the walk with me and a few other brave friends. Once again, following the same routine, we drove down this windy road, made the right, awed at the house and rounded the turn. At that exact moment, once again with my iPod paused (speakers at max), the heartbeat resumed. My other friend and I had earlier told the new additions about this exact turn and they insisted it wasn't true. They soon realized we were not joking. I could feel something as we rounded the turn that wasn't normal, something not like us. Something that didn't us there. But I didn't listen to myself and we continued on for the sake of excitement.

After parking the car, the whole group got out and we walked to the grave. One of my friends had a camera to see if we could pick anything up. After looking though the pictures we found nothing until they were put onto the computer. The screen was too small to find [this](http://i.imgur.com/XQxOT.jpg). Hopefully you can see what is right in front of my face, I sure couldn't at the time. This one is a [better look](http://i.imgur.com/HGUbg.png). This story is true, and that is really me. Please don't look at the images unless you have read the whole story. This picture is unaltered except for my writing and poor paint skills. I hope you got chills from this.

I recently bought an ancient laptop to use for writing work (IBM ThinkPad, circa 2004, WinXP 32-bit, crappy-ass Intel integrated graphics chipset, etc. etc.).

I've got a handful of creepy projects on board. I enjoy listening to music while I write, but I don't have the hard drive space for tons of music. So, my question is:

Do you listen to creepy music online?
If so, what would you recommend?

The only styles of music I'm not too keen on are rap and country, and even then, there are exceptions. But I'm specifically looking for atmospheric, quality online listening.

I dont really mind nightmares that involves monsters and stuff like that becouse
i am an avid horror flick fan. But nightmares that involves near ones getting injured och killed really gets to me.

Many years ago i ingested something called Theralen wich is an Antihistamine that makes you REALLY drowsy and
is a sure thing to get your dreams lucid and unwakeble from.
After seeing the movie Inception i came to think about this night and wanted to write this down.
I dreamt that i dreamt that i dreamt. I cant remember the specifics of the noghtmare but i know that i woke up in the
dream two times. It was standard horror movie style where you think you waked from the dream and THEN something scary happens
and you ""wake"" up again. Well, in the last dream state i dreamt that there were a power outage and styff got really scary.
At last i was able to wake up for real (but after the abusive nightmare i was not 100% sure).
I turned on the light, tried to calm down from the rush of having the ultimate nightmare.
Then… The power went out. Was i STILL in a dream? I live in the city and oatages is not frequent (like max two times a year).
The power went back after a while and it was not a dream. i did survive the night ;)

[To the basement 
](http://i.imgur.com/ifv4Z.jpg)

My friend told my about this house he had found right off campus of our community college. It was abandoned and was about 20 feet from the baseball field, but was hardly visible due to some trees. He said it had four levels; a basement, two levels above it and a small room as the third floor. 

I went with two of my friends a couple hours before sunset to check it out. There were actually two other buildings accompanying it, an overgrown greenhouse and a garage who's roof was collapsing. After quick examinations we decided they weren't worth while to check further so we proceeded to the house.

We decided it was best to explore methodically and entered in through the basement. Down there we only found a bunch of clothes and trash with a washer and dryer. The first floor was when we started getting sketched out as it had a small kids sized mattress on the ground with blood stains, broken windows and one chair. There was a stairway down to another basement area separate from the main basement. It was an open area and a bathroom with a tub overflowing in milk jugs, it looked as if it was used to make drugs, and fairly recently, we argued on whether or not to press forward, but we did. On the next floor we walked into a seemingly emptied room, so we turned around and found a huge monstrous face glaring back at us. We all jumped before we realized it was just a magnificent piece of graffiti, but we were all on edge now. In the other bedroom up there was completely empty except for an open umbrella and another milk jug in the closet. The bathroom on this level, was very small, the door only opened enough to stick your head in. So I looked behind the door to see a tree that had been ripped out of the ground and laid horizontally on the toilet leaning against the wall, we had no idea how or why this was here.

The only place left to explore was the third floor, the attic. The stairs to this attic were very steep and you could not see what was up there at all. We began to climb until we noticed scrawled writing on the top step. It read, ""get out of my house"". This freaked us out immensely, and seeing as there was no way to tell what was up there we left immediately without exploring the attic. When we felt we were a safe distance away we looked back and saw an old man in the top window, the window of the attic. You can see this window in the picture. He immediately disappeared.

Although we were scared out of our minds we were curious as hell. We decided to go back a different day in broad daylight with more people and various blunt weapons to defend ourselves so we could explore the top floor. We made rounds through the house, to ensure we were the only ones there, but really we were all just scared to approach the attic. When we finally worked up the guts to climb the stairs it was a slow process. Upon finally reaching the top we found a chair facing the open window and a rope hung from the window. This alone creeped us out, but we were glad to find that no one was up there until someone pointed out a small door most likely leading to a crawlspace. The latch hung off as it would if someone climbed inside and pulled the door shut. We decided to get out of there as we felt we had already made enough risky moves climbing the stairs in the first place.

But as curiosity always gets the best of us, The next day we decided to go and possibly open the door, this time at night. We got a group of 6 people and walked all the way to the baseball field. As we approached where the house was we started getting scared and stopped for a bit. I had a flashlight and went closer with my friend while the others stayed behind. When I got about 15 feet from the entrance, I noticed the house was gone. It wasn't a house anymore. It was a huge pile of what used to be the house. It had to have been destroyed that day. The only thing left of it was the lawn chair from the attic sitting next to a milk jug. We never did find out what was hiding behind that door.
    

    
    [edit]: Unfortunately my friend doesn't have any pictures from the top two floors besides the face. These were from the first time.

This happened years ago, only once.  I was a teenager, at home, sleeping soundly; I probably would have continued to snooze but was awakened by something brushing against my cheek.  

Thank God it was morning and the sun was shining, or I might have had a heart attack.

There was only me.  My own left arm was beyond numb; it was dead. I felt nothing.  But it wasn't dead, it was flailing... sort of like a marionette having its strings pulled.  My shoulder and elbow joints would fully extend, reach back and knock the headboard, drop back down to the mattress, brush across my face again, and so on. All the while feeling nothing.

The worst part was, even though I was wide awake at this point I couldn't will it to stop. I had to pin it down with my other arm and wait until the feeling started to return.

I think what freaked me out most was the total lack of control over my own body. I'm sure there has to be an explanation for this; Nosleep, have you ever heard of such a thing?

63,He's getting closer...,1296494537,"so last evening was a little weird. i thought nothing of it then, but after cruising the past weekends worth of submissions here on r/nosleep, the paranoia is catching up.  i suppose it was nothing too outlandish, but its starting to give me *that* feeling the more i think about it.

i went to the theater last evening with a friend to watch 'the rite'.  it was a pretty good movie, and anthony hopkins delivered his usual make-your-skin-crawl performance that made the movie so appealing.  after the movie, i say goodbye to my friend and head off to my car.  before driving off i decide to go ahead and grab a new cd to listen, as that i had been listening to the last one for going on a month now.  so i pick my queens of the stoneage-songs for the deaf cd which i havent listened to in a while.  

while driving down the road, i start hearing whispers.  of course, coming out of that movie, im thinking its just my imagination, and my nerves are settled when i realize its just some vocals in the first 2 songs that had never noticed before(somehow?).  ok, everything is cool, im just being stupid, apparently that movie was a little creepier than i initially thought.  get home and everything is fine.

a little later im standing on my back porch smoking a cigarette.  im mindlessly staring off into the corner of the yard, looking at the huge oak tree thats eventually going to flatten my neighbors house one of these days.  and thats when i notice the movement out of the corner of my eye.  

i didnt turn my head fully around because i could see it pretty well out of my peripheral vision.  contrasting against the dark brick facade of the neighbors house, i see a small pale oval, roughly the size and shape of a human head, bobbing across the little break in trees towards the small stand at the corner of the yard.

i sat there a little confused for a few seconds before i turned towards where i had seen the movement.  stared at the neighbors yard and the stand of trees, thinking maybe it was their dog i had seen.  but there was no more movement.  everything was completely still and, i became aware, deathly silent.  no traffic, no sirens, none of the typical city sounds. 

i just told myself im imagining things again, finished the last drag of my smoke, and retreated from the silence.

but i swear, one of the tree trunks looked a little thicker in the darkness than i remembered.",nosleep,splattypus,/r/nosleep/comments/fchcs/hes_getting_closer/

68,Black,1296446741,"Bad circulation runs in my family. It’s just one of the things my blood relatives share, from our black hair and pale grey eyes, to our general skinnyness – not a single person in my family weighs more than ten stone.

The thing about bad circulation is that it’s, well, bad. The blood can’t flow properly into the hands and feet, so when our capillaries close against the cold, our hands change colour. White; pink; red; finally, a black that looks as though our hands are rotting. Get us back in the warm, they switch back to the peachy-pinky hue we’re used to.

Think you know the backs of your hands? Try looking down and finding that they’re a freakish, unnatural shade and you never felt the change. It’s pretty surreal, even to imagine, so I bet you can understand how creeped out my hands made me feel in the winter. It’s not like I could store them in a chest until spring rolls round again.

Except that I did. 

More than once.

The first time, I was walking home from school. It was deep winter, too cold for snow – bleak, lifeless frost turning the ground to sludge. I remember that breathing was hard. Each breath a struggle. 

IN – The bite of air deprived of oxygen

OUT – The cloy of breath too full of heat

IN – The shock of cold, with no redeeming clarity

OUT – A white sheen descending over my vision, slowly at first, increasing in speed, ‘til I was blinded by light, flickering pink only adding to the confusion.

(red)

Reality bullied my mind into wakefulness. Confusion. A watery slickness between my fingers. My eyes flickering open. A mess of blood. A body. Small. A squirrel? Some small creature, ripped open, my hands smeared, stinking of its insides.

I ran.

A month of rationalisation later and I was feeling better, more myself. There were plenty of reasonable explanations. None of which involved me killing a squirrel. Life went on, as it seems to do and I came to terms with (red) what had happened.

(red)

It happened again. A dog this time. No white or pink this time, simply (red) waking up smeared with blood and the knowledge that something had gone (red) badly wrong. I don’t know what’s happening to me, but I know I can’t keep this up. I’ve progressed from the last squirrel to my dog in a week. It’s getting (black) worse. I have to stop this before (black) something really bad happens. I’m going to visit my sister – she knows about the (black)

(black)

Oh god. My hands are slick with (red) again. There was nobody else it could have come from. If I open my eyes are my hands going to be inside her chest, thrust through her ribs? I can’t look. Can’t. Won’t. Whatever made me like this, it’s won. It’s over. It’s over. Just don’t make me see again. I need the (black)

74,Orange Points,1296432203,"We’re not allowed to smoke in our house. It’s part of the contract and we don’t want to get thrown out, so we smoke in the yard; just outside the kitchen, next to the garage door. It wasn’t so bad on blistering summer days – the light breeze and ample shade made a refreshing change from the dank humidity of the house and we’d spend hours talking, smoking; enjoying the day and each other’s company.

Winter’s changed all that, of course. We scurry outside only when our nicotine dependant brains declare no more! and force us out into the cold. None of us stays out longer than we have to and we almost never go to smoke as a group anymore. I’ve taken to smoking in the garage at night. It’s kind of creepy, but at least it’s out of the wind. 

It is cold in there, though. Too cold, come to think of it – some nights it seems colder than outside. It’s probably just me being paranoid, but those nights when it’s colder than it should be, I feel a prickling on the back of my neck, as though something is standing so close, I can feel it breathing, watching, waiting for... Well, like I said, I’m probably just being paranoid.

The weird thing is, late at night, when I’ve finished my last cigarette before bed, I turn around to lock the garage door and see two orange points glowing through the glass, in the darkened garage. At first I figured it was just the embers of my smoke, fading in the ashtray – bright points of colour given strange significance in the tenebrous, frosty night.

So, I moved the ashtray. A few times, in fact. But the orange points haven’t gone away. I guessed it must be a streetlight’s reflection in the glass, but there aren’t any streetlights even close to that door.  There’s nothing that I can find that could be causing those two orange points.

I know it’s just paranoia, but every night I go out, the prickling on my neck is worse – more intense – and the feeling something is behind me is getting stronger. The worst thing, though, is that every night, no matter what, those orange points are there when I turn back to lock the door.  And every time I turn back, those orange points have moved a little closer.

78,The Gallery Of Henri Beauchamp,1296414984,"If you go into this one tiny, dingy one-story bar in Paris, and the right bartender is behind the counter that night, you might be able to see a very exclusive gallery show of the lost works of one Henri Beauchamp. But, to get in, you have to prove you're a devotee of the artist to get in.

You'll be asked, in clear and perfect English, ""What would like to partake of this glorious night?"". Answer absinthe, no matter what. Any other drink, from whiskey to water, will kill you as you sleep.

The next question will regard the type, and you MUST answer one of two things: ""The stuff that Man himself could not bear to take,"" or, ""The good stuff. The best stuff."" If you ask for any other absinthe, in any other way, you will be plagued by nightmares for 13 days. Each night's dream will be more horrible than the last, until, upon the thirteenth dream, your nightmare will follow you, every moment of your waking and sleeping life. Don't try and cheat the barkeep: the door is locked behind you. You have to drink what he gives you, doom or not. That such a powerful man granted you audience should be enough. Besides, I've heard that the dying complimented his drinks in their death throes.

If you make it that far before sealing your fate, the bartender will say, ""Be sure you handle this with care; this is the finest I have."" From here, you may do one of two things: Say, word for word, ""I overestimated my fortitude, and I bid you good eve."". If the barkeep nods, you may leave the door you entered, unharmed and with nothing gained and nothing lost (except the time spent inside).

Or you can go on. You will be given a glass with a seven-sided rim, with each side twisting ever so delicately around the basin until forming a sleek and simple handle. You will also receive a very, very, very special absinthe spoon, in the shape of a key; the holes at the key's top serve as the draining point for the alcohol to pour over the sugar cube. And, of course, an unmarked bottle, stripped long ago of its label, scraps of paper sticking to its sides, covered in the rot of the decades past.

The spoon is completely flat, but has two distinct sides: one with a groove along the shaft of the key, and one without. Turn the shaft down, so its groove will be face down. If you attempt this face up, your absinthe will taste foul, your nose will burn, and your eyes will shrivel in their sockets with unspeakable horrors not of this world. Now, if your spoon is the right way up, begin preparing the absinthe as one would (put the sugar on the spoon, and pour the alcohol over so it gains its color and ""special qualities"").

Say ""cheers"" to your friend, the barkeep, and bottoms up. If you don't, the absinthe will burn every innard it touches with the power and pain of sulfuric acid.

If you've done it right, the already dim lights will go off, and darkness will consume the bar. Don't be afraid; the darkness is the cue that you've been approved for the exhibit. Wait out the darkness, and keep silent as the dead, lest the bartender decide to make you so.

Eventually (not too long, two to three minutes), a green floodlight will shine brightly on a door on the far wall of the bar. The bar will be bathed in green, and not just from the floodlight. Little luminescent spheres will gently drift through the room, and the barkeep will no longer be there… nor any other unassuming patron inside before. There's no danger by this point… consider it a safe point. If you didn't finish the absinthe, you don't have to, but you might need the alcohol. Either way, take the spoon and put it in the keyhole of the green-lit portal's doorknob. It will fit perfectly, and reach the end of the keyhole with a resounding click.

Inside is a small elevator, with the most beautiful woman any mortal eyes can imagine, bathed in the green glow in just such an angle that the light refracts beyond her into the shape of wings.

The Green Fairy herself will ask you, ""Going up?”, and considering all the trouble you went through, it would only make sense to say yes.

Now, you have one more hurdle to clear. She will ask you, as you cross the line from the bar to the compartment, ""How would you compare Beauchamp's surrealism to that of, say, Rene Magritte?"" For your reply, you must say, ""I've come to see more than art tonight.""

If you don't, the green floodlight will blow out, the doors will slam shut, and the elevator will plummet through a seemingly infinite blackness before a red light grows brighter as the elevator nears the very depths of Hell. Now, if your elevator begins to go up, the green light will also fade, but in its place will be the cool glow of the moon. But, before you even recognize it, the elevator will reach the top of its… well, let's call it a shaft to not get too intricate.

Now, I'm not as sure about this as the rest, but I've heard that, if the Green Fairy kisses you on the cheek as she leaves the elevator, you will always be blessed with a creative inspiration: a permanent, ever-changing muse. You can't ask her, you can't kiss her; she has to do it of her own volition. If not… well, nothing, but no reason to do it anyway and anger the woman who is responsible for keeping the Beauchamp paintings safe for so many years.

You will enter, from the elevator, a turn-of-the-century parlor, with a large poster of Henri Beauchamp on the left side of the opposite wall; on the right is a door.

Taking the time to read the poster is a fairly good idea, as it explains the very significance of Mr. Beauchamp. You see, he was a struggling surrealist in the 1920s, always making art to try to be free of all premeditation, and managed to do so. You see, after one night in a tiny, dingy one-story bar in Paris, he began to paint… patterns. First it was geometric patterns. Then complete fractals. Then images that would be in the newspaper the next day. Then next week. Then from fifty years ago. 100 in the future, 200 in the past…

Then, on his last night of life, he kidnapped three young girls from their homes at night, murdered them, and painted his finest masterpieces in reds and yellows with the blood and bile of virgins.

He committed suicide immediately after painting exactly 13 of these.

These are behind the door.

The first six, from the left, show, from left to right: the genesis of the universe, the only true visage of God as viewable to the eyes of man, the true image of Jesus Christ, the sprawling clouds of Heaven, every Pope from the first to faces not yet recognizable, and a portrait of Jesus' appearance in his Second Coming.

The other six, on the right, show, from right to left: the cataclysmic of the universe, the only true visage of Satan as viewable to the eyes of man, the true image of Judas, the sprawling flames of Hell, every human-embodied demon from the first to faces not yet recognizable, and a portrait of the Antichrist in his Second Coming.

Now, six and six makes twelve. But what of the thirteenth?

This thirteenth painting is turned around on its wall pin, the image facing the wall. The space around it is roped up at a very wide diameter, and under the flipped image is a sign, in three languages. The top is in the scriptures of the seraphim, the bottom in the runes of the highest demonic orders, and in the middle, in Roman letters.

DO

NOT

TOUCH

Now, like the kiss, I can't say this part with as much certainty, but all the same… I heard that, somehow, as he died, Beauchamp flayed his skin, his organs, his very soul, into some sort of collage. How he took his dead body and created such a horrific masterpiece, I could never say, nor would I ever dare to.

So… if you make it, maybe you can flip the canvas over and tell me sometime? You can tell me about it over a drink.

79,"whatever you do, don't let go...",1296393975,"Thought I'd share this, haven't thought about it in a long while.

When I was a kid I'd sometimes have nightmares all kids do I guess. But BEFORE i had a nightmare I had another dream, a prelude, a warning. It was always the same.

In the pre-lude dream I was standing in an empty white void, nothing at all around me. Then I'd start to hear footsteps approaching from far, far away. My heart started to beat harder. Then in the distance I'd see a man approaching, holding something. I was stuck to the spot in the white void, the man walking right towards me. As he got nearer, I could see he was my dad, but he looked very serious and had something dark hovering above his right hand.

At this point in the dream I always knew what was about to happen and I couldn't stop it.

My dad came right up to me and in his hand he was holding a black balloon on a string, like a black helium balloon (I'm having shivers and goose bumps remembering this, fuck!)

He would lean over and slowly hand me the balloon, looking into my eyes the whole time and say,

""Whatever you do, don't let go. Don't let go, Don't let go...""

Then he'd turn and walk away and I would seriously panic but I was frozen to the spot, unable to move because I knew what this dream meant: I was about to have a horrible nightmare.

And then the black balloon would start to get bigger, and bigger, and bigger...turning all the whiteness into black, the whole time my father's voice repeating to me ""Don't let go, don't let go...""

When the balloon had filled all the white with its blackness, the nightmare would begin. I knew it was coming and I was sick with fear but there was nothing I could do. It was nightmare time.

I don't really remember the nightmares but I do remember the dream of the black balloon. I had this dream quite a few times and it chills me even now to think about it 30 years later. The wonders of the sleeping mind.",nosleep,dudenotude,/r/nosleep/comments/fbso1/whatever_you_do_dont_let_go/

81,Am I a magnet for crazies?,1296383409,"Ok nosleep, I just got home from a rough night, and its still too early to call every person I know and talk about this insanity, so I'm typing this up.

You may or may not remember, like a month back I made a post here about another f'ed up experience with a girl I can only assume is a little crazy. I used to work in an ophthalmology lab during nights, where a handful of very very creepy things happened, and one day a grad student (I think) pulled a fire alarm in order to get a chance to corner me alone and tell me should could see a ghost that was stalking me. Super weird I know. 

Well, I think tonight I topped that for creepiness. This isn't a ghost story, but its probably the scariest thing thats ever happened to me.

Earlier tonight I was out with two male friends drinking at the bars on campus. I didn't get too trashed, I wish I had, but we were all buzzed and laughing and having a good time. Usually when we hit the bars we're pretty much exclusively trying to meet girls, but this time we were just playing darts and drinking by ourselves. However, despite my lack of effort and much to my surprise, an attractive girl actually approached us halfway through the night. Or I should say approached me, because she did, she was very clear about her intentions. She didn't seem to have any girlfriends there with her, which really should have given off warning signs, but I wasn't paying attention to that sort of thing.

I bought her a drink, we flirted for a bit, and then I called it an early night when she pulled me out by the coat, back to her place. My friends gave me thumbs up and I haven't talked to them since. It was a short walk, the apartment she took me to was downtown, almost directly on the main street in fact. I'll have to walk past it almost everyday this semester, which I will not enjoy from now on. It was about midnight when we crashed on her couch in the dark. We made out, she got up and brought back more drinks, we continued in the fashion that young liberated college students do, and by two or threeish (I'm not really sure, there was no clock) she was passed out (so I thought) and I was considering whether or not to slip out before morning.

Then she stirred. I almost rolled over to hold her, thinking she was ready for another go, but held still for a moment letting her take the lead. She must have thought I was asleep. She held her face over mind, and whispered ""I hate you.""

Thats so f'ed up, seriously, what the hell, I can't stop thinking about it, how she said it. She paused a moment and added ""Wait for me."" Then she got out of bed, slipped into her clothes soundlessly (incredibly soundlessly for a girl I thought was wasted), left the apartment, and locked the door.

I bolted up, put my clothes on, counted to sixty and headed for the door to get the heck out of dodge. We were in a main room of the apartment, the door to the outside was through a dark room, with a counter, that I assumed was a kitchen when I came in. As I got up I fumbled around for a light in between these two rooms, found one, and flipped it.

When the apartment was illuminated it was clear that there was something seriously wrong going on. Aside from my shoes by the door and the couch in the room behind me the apartment was entirely empty. By which I mean abandoned, not fit for inhabitation, the kitchen was gutted, piping showing where there would have been an oven or a dishwasher or whatever, and half a counter with smashed porcelain sink bits everywhere. The main room had peeling wallpaper over smashed drywall, and down the darkened hall I could see a room totally closed off by that plastic sheeting builders put up to keep dust and paint fumes from wafting out of unfinished areas. It was clear to me that this girl did not live here.

That said she had either planned for this, or brought people here before because there was a case of beer and the couch in the main room.

Needless to say I left immediately and came home. I don't know at all how to handle this, there was about 2 full minutes between when she left and when I left that apartment. I can't wait for morning so I can tell my friends about this, its complete insanity.


***Update


Went down the street to get a pot pie. Came home, door is unlocked, roommate's door is open and his light is on, he must have left. The girl has just texted me ""I asked you to wait"". If I hear a noise in this house I swear I'll break down.

84,"To escape a hurricane, we stayed in the jungle of Belize (photo w/ apparition[?])",1296362937,"So the title's a bit misleading. We didn't actually sleep IN the jungle. Read on. It's a long one, I tend to pay attention to detail when I storytell...

So in lieu of Hurricane Richard (October 2010), my friend Annie and I decided to leave the quaint little island that we live on (in Belize) to find retreat up in the hills and jungle of the mainland. Little did we know that the hurricane would change its course and head directly towards us. But that's another story (remind me to tell you about our hurricane party later heh).

So we opted to stay at a friend's newly built house in the jungle. We roughed out the hurricane (our first; originally being from California, we're used to earthquakes and not hurricanes) and decided to stay a few more days before heading back home.

The next evening, Annie and I visited another friend's brand new boutique resort, built on the river, and decided to have dinner. Mind you, the resort is beautiful, so she started taking a ton of photos from the moment we got there, well into the evening. By the end of the evening, I opted to stay the night while Annie went back to our other friend's home.

Later that evening, the owner of the resort (friend of mine) and I were sitting outside in the open dining hall that overlooks the river. We're sitting side by side on the same table a few feet away from each other, while doing what we do best on the computer (*nofap*). All the guests are in their rooms and staff had gone home for the day. The bar doors (behind us) were closed and locked, as were the doors to the office (in front of us).

[Photo of said area where I was sitting](http://imgur.com/ITZlq)

With my friend to the right of me, to the left is just the open dining hall. And then I feel it. A tap on my left shoulder. Instantly, I think my friend is doing the whole ""reach around and touch me on the opposite shoulder to make me look in the wrong direction"" routine, so I turn to him and tell him ""haha nice try. what's up?"" It's at this moment that I realize that he's busy typing away on the computer.

""What's up bro?"" He turns to me and asks.

""Uh, dude, did you just tap me on my shoulder?""

""Nah man, I've been chatting on the computer.""

Mind you, my buddy is a pretty big fellow, and if he would've tapped me on the shoulder, I would've caught the movement in my peripheral vision. Just sayin... That's when I turned around for the first time.

Nothing. I thought maybe someone was playing a joke on me. Maybe my buddy's brother. Maybe an on-site staff member. Hell, maybe even a guest. I stood up to go check the hallway to see if anyone was hiding. Nope. I then checked the doors to the office and the doors to the bar. Locked.

So I get back to the computer, and this time, I'm a bit weary of my surroundings. And then my buddy proceeds to tell me that there are definitely spirits of ancient Mayans around the area. That he feels them all the time, and that they won't harm me. That they're tied to the river flowing beneath us and that the water transports the spirits easier.

Before I go on, I must tell you that I've always been one to feel these spirits, and occasionally have seen apparitions previously in my life. So as I'm sitting there, I'm kinda freaking out, and wondering if the tap on my shoulder was just my imagination. I tried to remember how hard the pressure was; it was equivelant to the force of an adult person tapping you on the shoulder. While I was thinking about if it actually was just my imagination, I felt it again. This time, it felt like a whole hand on my shoulder, and it lasted a bit longer. At first, I didn't move, but instantly out of the corner of my eye, looked towards my friend's direction. I could cleary see his hands typing away. So I turn my head as fast as I could towards the left, and lo and behold...

...Nothing. I can't explain it. At this point, I have the chills and my hair must be standing on end. My arms are FREEZING cold and covered in goosebumps. My buddy, startled by me, looks over at me, and is like ""Dude, you're pale as shit bro."" And that's when I notice that his arms are covered in goosebumps too. ""It just got cold, didn't it?"" he says.

I'm done. I start packing my stuff and don't wanna stick around anymore. I tried calling Annie, but being in the jungle, there's weak reception, and the call didn't go through. My buddy tells me it's cool man, just go upstairs and turn on the tv.

At this point, I'm not really scared, but just a bit startled. I don't like that this thing, whatever it is, is fucking with me. Just show yourself, so I can see you with my own eyes, and then I'll be cool with it. I'm thinking about all this and if I really must be going crazy, and I drift away.

I wake up to my phone ringing, so I take the call. It's Annie, asking if I want to do lunch in town. I ask her for the time, and she tells me it's 8AM. I start to tell her about last night, then the reception cut out and dropped the call. So I put the phone on the nightstand, grab the remote for the tv that was sitting right next to it, and turn off the tv. Off to the shower.

After my shower, I walk out, and the tv is back on. I go to look for the remote, and it's not there. My phone is there, and I notice the apple logo. Which means that it was rebooting. Odd. I look around for the remote, and I have no idea where it is. I turn off the tv manually, finish up in the bathroom, and get dressed. I reach for my computer bag, then for my phone... My phone is not there, but the remote for the TV is. WTF. I'm thinking at this point, my buddy is fucking with me. He knows how freaked out I was last night, and now he's just playing a joke on me. Ha ha. So I open the door to the room and go next door to his suite. I can see clearly into the room through the glass doors, and see that him and his fiance are fast asleep.

Could it be the housekeeper or maid? I doubt that they would enter my room while I'm still occupying it... I go back inside, and there's my phone, sitting on the middle of the bed. Hmmmm. I guess I just tossed it on my bed after the reboot thing. But I could have sworn that I didn't touch it...

[photo of room I stayed in](http://imgur.com/FBhEZ)

Anyway, I meet up with Annie for lunch in town, and we head back to our friend's house and carry on with the day. As the day turns toward evening, she's sitting on the bed going through her camera and uploading the photos from the trip so far. That's when I remembered to tell her what happened last night and in the morning. I finish the story, and don't get a respone from her. I look towards her, and she just has this HOLY SHIT look on her face. She's staring at the computer screen, so I ask her what's wrong.

She then turns the computer towards me, and there is a picture that she took of herself. I'm like ""What, you think you look fat in the photo or something?""

She just sits there. That's when I notice it. There is a smoky hazy figure in the bottom right corner of the screen. I'm thinking it's cigarette smoke, but Annie hates cigarette smoke. She wouldn't be anywhere near cigarette smoke long enough to take a photo of herself. So I told her it was probably fog. So I ask her if there are any more, and we go through and notice that there are orbs in a bunch of the photos. My first instinct was that they are just water spots on the lens, because it's an underwater camera, as well, but some of them just didn't look like water spots. Regarding the original image though, there was a set of 3 photos that she took of herself. The apparition only appeared in one. It definitely wasn't fog, as fog doesn't materialize and disappear within a few seconds...

Then it all made sense. This was the spirit or whatever that wanted my attention the night before. It had to be. ""But Joe, maybe it's just your mind playing tricks on you,"" but then again, *you* weren't there so stfu... And I know I'm not insane, just like everyone thought I was every time I told them about other experiences in the past...

That's when Annie looked at me and told me. ""Joe. Last night, while we were eating dinner, I KNOW I felt someone standing behind me. I didn't want to tell you cuz I thought it might freak you out.""

During supper, she was sitting with her back to the same spot that I was later when I felt someone touch me.

Here is the image, as I just came across it on her facebook album. I didn't get her permission to post this... I'm sure she'll be okay with it, and I'll send her a link to it later.

But in the image, you can see where all I did was bump up the levels and contrast of the photo. So you be the judge. Could this be the apparition of the spirit that was trying to get my attention? The one that she felt was standing behind her during dinner?

**TL;DR: Went to the jungle to escape hurricane. After hurricane, had dinner at resort. Friend went home, I stayed the night. Felt someone tap my shoulder on two occasions. Nothing there. Went to bed, woke up to weird shit happening. Told friend about it later. Friend felt like someone was standing behind her during dinner. She captured a picture with it, picture below.**

87,"You told me this scared you, so...",1296337090,"It was a late August afternoon, right after school. The sun hung brightly above, and the skies were a crystal cerulean. My son sat silently, stone-faced in the back seat of the black minivan, his brown eyes staring blankly ahead.  I looked at him in the rearview mirror. “Hey Brandon, do you like the new doctor?” Brandon didn’t respond. I sighed to myself. I was hoping that what we picked up from Walgreen’s on the way home from the appointment would snap him back to reality, away from those awful hallucinations and night terrors. I didn’t say anything else to him the rest of the trip home.

Brandon didn’t say anything either, until I pressed the button on the garage remote to open the yawning chasm to our three car garage, although there was only one car ever parked in it, and most of it was tools and boxes. When he saw the garage opening he started screaming and flailing his arms. “Stop the car, Dad! Stop the car! Please turn on the light first Daddy! Please!”

I knew this was coming, so I turned the car off (for safety) and took the keys with me, and got out of the van. I went inside the garage and flipped the switch next to the door that led into the house. Now most garages have a small light bulb or two to provide dim illumination—mine had a couple of floodlights in the ceiling, making the inside of the garage nearly as bright as day and leaving hardly any shadow. Brandon had insisted on having multiple bright lights everywhere throughout the house, and since I had the money and the doctor said to humor it, I did it.

Once I turned the lights on, Brandon pulled himself out of the van and went scampering into the garage. Once I was sure he was in the house, I turned the car back on and drove it slowly into the garage and parked it. I went into the house where Brandon was sitting at the kitchen table, scribbling furiously.

“What are you drawing there, Brandon?” I said casually, sliding up to the kitchen table. He had all his school supplies splayed across the table, including some papers that looked like they had drawings on them. My smile faded when I picked some of them up.

The drawings, while crude, were far more detailed than anything I had ever seen Brandon draw. On the paper was scrawled the figure of a man, but something about it was not right. Its head was too small, its torso too long, and it had five or six strangely bent arms with long fingers. Its legs were strangely shaped and longer than even a basketball player’s.  “What…what is all this, Brandon?”

“It’s the boogeyman,” he said as-a-matter-of-factly, continuing to draw. “He lives in my closet.”

A cold shiver went over my body, but also relief. He was just in that phase of childhood, albeit a bit stranger than normal. “Want me to put these on the fridge?” I joked rather morbidly. Brandon didn’t answer.

Night fell, and the house was bathed in brilliant halogen lights on all three floors. I went up to Brandon’s room to wish him good night. He was in his bed with the covers up to his chin. I couldn’t understand how the kid could sleep in that much light. His eyes were still open, staring blankly forward. I followed his gaze to the open closet, where the lights were off. “Oh, I get it, you need the closet lit and closed,” I said, and moved towards the closet. For an instant I froze. I could have sworn I saw the figure from Brandon’s drawings standing there in the shadows. I shook my head—it was gone. Brandon’s disorder was getting to me.

I continued walking to the closet. It was bitterly cold in there—very odd since it was open and the room’s ambient temperature was about 70. I shook it off and turned the closet’s light on—I heard a pinging noise and no light came. The bulb must have been out. Figures. I slammed the door shut and grinned at Brandon. “All set—the closet door is shut!”

I helped Brandon take his new medicine, and he was out within a few minutes. After making sure he was okay, I went downstairs to watch TV.

I awoke suddenly on the couch sometime much later. The TV had gone to static. One of the cats must have pulled the RCA cables out of the input, I thought. I squinted to try and find a clock. 3:04 AM. Great.

The next thing I noticed was that the house was completely dark. Was there a power outage? I didn’t remember any storms in the forecast. Beyond that, the TV and clock were on. Maybe all our lights blew a circuit breaker again. That had happened before. My next thought was why wasn’t Brandon screaming his head off due to the darkness? Right, I thought. The new medication had knocked him out.

I sighed and dragged myself off the couch and went into the kitchen looking for a flashlight. I hadn’t gotten very far when I heard a horrid scream come from upstairs. “Brandon!” I yelled, and instantly pounded through the house, up the stairs and towards Brandon’s room. He must have woken up in the darkness.

Brandon’s door was closed. I hadn’t left it closed. I tried to open it. Locked. Brandon screamed again. “Brandon!” I yelled, pounding on the door.  That did it. I side-kicked the door, then rammed it with my shoulder as hard as I could. The door gave and the jamb split, swinging open.

A blast of bitterly cold air almost pushed me back into the hallway. Brandon’s room was pitch black. I couldn’t even see the window on the other side. I flipped the switch on the wall next to the door. “Brandon?” I called out.

The light never came.

Suddenly the room came into dim focus as I began shivering from the icy air. The closet door was wide open, and the shadows inside seemed to be spinning. I began searching the bedroom visually for Brandon, as the window was closed. “Brandon?” I called. I turned to face the dresser with its huge mirror to the ceiling. I saw my own reflection, and something else that shouldn’t have been there.

I saw Brandon, but he was floating in mid-air, suspended by a long, thin black arm attached to an absolutely horrifying figure. It was inhumanly tall, its head touching the vaulted ceiling in Brandon’s room. Its head had no features, no hair, no face—just a sphere of strange-colored flesh.  It had a sickly thin neck that attached it to the long bony torso. It was vaguely reminiscent of a tuxedo, or something. I wasn’t sure if it was standing or floating on two impossibly long and thing legs, also black.  It had at least three arms, one holding Brandon up high in the air. I looked behind me instantly—nothing there. I looked back in the mirror—there it was with Brandon. Was I hallucinating or dreaming? I shook my head violently.  Something tapped me on the shoulder—I spun around, and there it was, towering at least ten feet over me. I swore my heart stopped in horror. “Brandon!” was all I could squeak out.

As I watched helplessly and in absolute fright, two or three whip-like black tentacles sprouted from its back and wrapped around Brandon like spider-silk, lifting him higher in the air. The spherical head opened like a Venus fly-trap, splitting in two. The tentacles shoved a screaming Brandon into its head, which snapped down on him like a beak, spraying blood everywhere and drenching my shirt in it. I screamed Brandon’s name I don’t know how many times and began to sob. “This isn’t happening! This isn’t happening! Oh my God, Brandon!”

Suddenly the lights came back on all over the house. I found myself on my knees in Brandon’s bedroom, covered in blood, with blood covering the floor too. I heard noises below me on the first floor, sounds of police. The neighbors must have heard the screaming and called 911. I knew what was coming. I knew what they would think. I ran to my own bedroom and opened the nightstand, and pulled out the pistol I kept for self-protection. I swallowed the barrel, and pulled the trigger.

96,Bizarre sleep incident,1296279286,"This incident happened a few years ago but for some reason I was thinking about it today while driving and figured r/nosleep might like it.

I was in my early 20s and living alone. One night, I wake up to the strangest feeling I have ever felt. It must have been about 3 a.m. and I wake up with my face and neck twitching. 

I know it doesn't sound like much but it was intense; the best way I can describe it is to try to touch your collar bone with the corner of your mouth. My head was tilted to my left, my mouth was pulled taunt to that one side and my neck muscles were flexed so tight that I could feel my neck cramping. When I woke up, I could feel this happening for maybe one or two seconds but I was completely powerless. Even though this was the most bizarre feeling I have ever had, logically I could write this off as some sort of sleep paralysis or maybe even a seizure (even though neither have happened to me before or since), but the really strange part happened when I began to tell my then-girlfriend about this the next day.

She was the type of person who genuinely believed in the supernatural and on at least three or four occasions she had had weird dreams about her family members one or two nights before they died. (And at least a dozen times she had those same types of dreams of people who are still alive years later, so make of it what you want)

The day after that incident, we were having lunch and much like a dream I had completely forgot about it until something happened that jogged my memory. So I begin to tell her, ""Oh, the strangest thing happened to me last night-"" but she interrupts my story with her own.

""Oh, that reminds me. I saw you last night.""

She had my attention here because we didn't see each other the night before and I ask her where she saw me. 

""In my room.""

""What do you mean you saw me in your room? I was at my place all night.""

""You were in my room and you were smiling. It was scary.""

""You mean you had a dream about me? Or you saw an apparition of me?""

""It was you. It was around 3 a.m., you were standing in my room and you looked so happy. You had the biggest smile I'd ever seen. It scared me because it was like a happiness you can only experience in death.""

At this point, I was stunned. My first thought was about my facial contortions from the night before and how it *could* look like a smile. When I explained what had happened to me, she said something like ""ok, that explains it"" and continued to eat her lunch. She was done talking about it because everything now made sense to her but I was even more confused than before.",nosleep,nobahdi,/r/nosleep/comments/fb70q/bizarre_sleep_incident/

One night I was doing my usual, playing call of duty and waiting for my dad to get home so we could eat dinner. I heard some noise downstairs so I went to see if it was him. When I opened my door i realized that there were no lights on in the house, other than in my room. I thought nothing of it because it was Ramadan and everybody was taking a nap until dinner. I called out for my dad but nobody answered, so I went back into my room. About ten minutes later I saw a shadow dart from the closet towards my door. As soon as the shadow disappeared there was a loud bang on my door. I was frozen in fear for a good five minutes until I finally worked up the courage to look in the hallway. There was nothing out there when I checked so I turned around to go back to my room. That's when I noticed there was something different. I have had the same letters glued to my door since I was five, and not once had one fallen in the past. But when I looked on the floor, the ""A"" was sitting there, broken in half. All that was left on my door was, ""HEL L"" When I saw that I shimmy shaked my way down the stairs and into my brother's room faster than the flash.",nosleep,MOAR_KRABS,/r/nosleep/comments/fb379/this_happened_to_my_friend_helal/

Yeah, I had experiences but as an adult I chalk them up to smoking entirely too much hashish and living in a large ancient house.

2,A bizarre occurrence this morning...,1296251442,"So, I was walking to my 9:10 am class after getting out of my 8 am English class (which sucks) and I saw something that I had to do a triple-take on. 

I was halfway down this long hallway that goes along the side of the largest building on campus when I looked up from the floor and noticed this girl who kind of stood out from the general flow of people: she was a short-ish with black hair that kind of looked a bit unkempt and framed her face in this eerie way. Otherwise she was wearing a black trench-coat style jacket, black gloves, and black jeans. That's all I saw in this brief instance.

She was walking in the opposite direction as me, but suddenly, right when I noticed her, she veered toward me a bit. This is when I noticed her face. Her eyes conveyed such a deep depressed and distressed look and she was frowning slightly. It was a really disturbing expression and freaked me the hell out. I moved over as I walked and she went by me only brushing against my left arm.

Now, I turned around for two reasons: 1, I just wanted another glimpse at this really out-of-the-ordinary girl and, 2, because when she brushed against my arm I got a little chill.

However, when I turned around to look at her, she was gone. There weren't any doors nearby that she could've escaped through in the couple seconds before I turned around and the hallway wasn't nearly crowded enough for her to be obscured by people. She was just gone.

I puzzled over this strange occurrence for the rest of the morning and realized my screenwriting professor from last semester had stopped class one day and pointed out that he'd just seen a ghost girl. That was in the auditorium not too far from where I saw this girl. I'm now convinced it was the ghost. 

Sorry if this isn't particularly scary, but it was a very bizarre and slightly unsettling encounter that I thought you fellow insomniacs would enjoy. ",nosleep,Hllblzr310,/r/nosleep/comments/fazjj/a_bizarre_occurrence_this_morning/

6,The sound...,1296206193,"When I was young I used to have a reoccurring experience. The experience was always began the same way. I would wake up in the night, and I would enter a state of limbo. I would wake just enough to sense the passage of time and remember the awful noise. Two noises, really, in repetition. The first was the largest sound imaginable, like the heart of a giant machine beating a single time. A low, deafening rumble that seemed to emanate from inside my head. The second sound was almost beautiful, but in a sickening way. It was so gentle, so soft. Like  the tiniest pin drop, or the breath of an angel. These two sounds, polar opposites, would repeat for what seemed like eternity, and at first it was most uncomfortable. However, after my first experience I knew what to expect next, and was never prepared for what would happen when it was over...

With a shock I would break the surface of full consciousness to sense a presence above me. Rather than a humanoid form, I would see a blanket of dark fog hanging just below the ceiling, obscuring the hanging lights and decorations there. It seemed to be boring invisible eyes into me, while pressing its presence down from above. The overall effect was what I imagine being pinned beneath a rabid animal must be like. And each time, the fog would hang there like an invisible, growling beast, until dawn. 

This happened to me about a dozen times between the ages of 8-12. Despite the fact it was  horrifying, I never really felt scared about it, until this morning at the breakfast table when my 8 year old described his most recent dream to me.

7,The Flying Painting ,1296200986,"This happened about 2-3 years ago in my house. The house itself was probably built around the 60's and I'm not too sure about whoever lived in it before my family. 
So I was in the spare bedroom and I don't quite remember what I was doing in there but I was probably getting something out of a drawer. There is a relatively tall dresser with a bunch of crap on it and there is a bed a few feet away from this dresser. The item of interest on this dresser was a painting. The painting was leaning against the wall and had all sorts of stuff in front of it. I walked past the dresser and the bed and then all of a sudden, I heard a loud crash. I turned around and somehow saw this painting hit the bed face down and then slid down onto the floor. Nothing on the dresser had been moved. The way this painting was flung at me was completely impossible. From leaning back against the wall to hitting the bed face down. 
My father was in a room down the hall and called out ""What did you break?"" I was terrified. 
Apart from that event, I had always been hearing weird things in my house when everybody was asleep. I would hear footsteps (which could have just been the house creaking) but I would also hear very weird music. Music that sounded very depressing. 
A friend of mine back then was a big believer in ghosts and she told me that I was going through a rough patch and therefore; was an easy target for a poltergeist. I honestly don't believe any of that but I just can't explain what happened. 
Has anyone else had any experiences like this?

8,The News Cycle,1296193516,"I work for a major news agency in London, on the copy desk. Yesterday, at about 5:30 in the morning, a story came in that a busload of schoolchildren had been found in a lake in the midlands, drowned. Apparently, their teacher had faked a school expedition, had sent out permission slips and everything, and had driven the bus to a nearby lake, had pumped some horrible home-made mustard gas through the windows, then driven straight into the water, killing everyone.

He'd killed close to 30 eight- and nine-year-old kids -- the photos were awful: divers had taken shots of the kids' faces, which were bloated with water. Their tongues were swollen and hanging from their mouths; some of them, in the panic and terror of the gas, had bitten and scratched at each other, leaving wounds and cuts in each other's arms and faces -- one girl had torn most of her own lips off trying to claw the gas away while it blistered her skin. It was horrible. The worst, though, were the pictures of the teacher. He'd handcuffed himself to the steering wheel and had bitten hard into the top of it. The photograph of his face showed his eyes: wide open and black, twinkling like lacquered wood. He looked so pleased with himself; he looked so deliriously *happy*.

A story like this is big news, so I showed it to the senior shift editor who said that I should send it off for translation while we waited for the picture editors to get in. He said that the pictures made him feel sick. 

About ten minutes later, I got an email back from our translation agency saying that they wouldn't work on the story. It was against their policies, and they wouldn't be a part of it. This is unprecedented: our translators never reject a story on content; I mean they can't, they're under contract -- so, I got up and went over to talk to the senior editor again.

""What story?"" he said.

""The bus one. The one I just showed you, with all those dead kids. The translators won't touch it.""

""Bus story?""

""The one with the photos. Just now. You said it made you feel sick.""

""What do you mean?"" he said, ""When?"" ""It's 6:00am -- I just sat down; I just got in."" ""Jack,"" he said, ""what are you talking about?""

I pulled him back to my desk to show him but there was no email on my screen. There was nothing in our inbox from the translators. I checked the submission portal and the story wasn't there. Nothing in 'Recent Documents', and Photoshop wasn't even open. I don't know how to explain it. I called the translators and they had no idea what I was talking about. I called the reporter who'd submitted the story, woke her up, and she said she'd sent nothing like that, although she was in Coventry for the night. 

My editor laughed it off but I can't. I know I saw that story and I know I'm not crazy. I can still see those blisters so clearly. And the teacher's teeth biting deep into the plastic of the wheel.",nosleep,JackofallCocktails,/r/nosleep/comments/fajwq/the_news_cycle/

12,Horrible.,1296186645,"I couldn't sleep, so I left my girlfriend in the bedroom and came out to poke around on Reddit for a bit.  I got a bit cold, so I decided to give sleep another try.  I walked slowly back into the bedroom to let my eyes adjust, and climbed back under the covers to find that my girlfriend was facing away from me, toward the wall.  I reached out and touched her.  She was cold, too cold even for sleeping on a freezing winter night.  I touched her somewhere else.  Cold.  I studied her for a second, and it dawned on me like stress fractures through glass: That is not my girlfriend.  That is not even breathing.  I flung the covers back in a rare moment of courage.  It began to shake.  Not violently, but more like it was tensing every muscle in its body.  I was mortified.  I was frozen.  I began to hear it mumbling.

""Baby...b..b...baby""

Its hand shot down to its bare thigh and began to make long, slow scratches with its fingernails.  I could do nothing but watch as the scratching grew faster and faster, harder and harder.  Soon the skin was curling off like string cheese, and thick, black blood was oozing down its leg and splattering all over the bed.  It kept accelerating, until the scratching was at an absolutely feverish pace.  

""Baby...baby...""

My open mouth turned to a grimace of terror as the scratching sound abruptly changed, and I realized that it had hit bone.  The sound now was horrible; I can only compare it to nails on a chalkboard at a deafening volume.  Its fingernails began to crack and pop off.  1.  2.  3.  At that point I closed my eyes and started grinding my teeth, anything to get that sound out of my head.

I'm lying in bed on my back. I see a figure standing in the doorway of my bedroom. I think to myself its my roommate. He stays up all night and randomly comes into my room to ask me stuff or wake me up from a night mare (happens a lot, hes used to it), or to kill a spider (this too happens a lot). I ask him what he wants and he just stands there. Thats when  I realize I'm asleep. Ok, no problem. Its just a dream. Only the figure isnt going away and suddenly I'm terrified of it. I feel wide awake but I cant move and I cant open my eyes but I can still SEE the figure in my doorway. I can hear my roommate playing team fortress down the hall and I can feel my dog sleeping next to me but I cant freaking move. I'm concentrating all my energy into moving or crying so that my roommate will hear and come wake me. My heart is racing and I'm frantically trying to wake myself up cause I feel like if I dont wake up asap I'll never wake up again. The figure starts to move towards me and I FEEL my finger twitch. BREAKTHROUGH! I MOVED. Thank god, now I can wake up and save my life. I sit straight up in bed and burst out with two long piercing screams. Before the second one is finished my roommate flips on the light and is standing in the doorway with a shoe asking ""where is it?!"" (god bless my roommate the ever vigilant killer of spiders). I start crying and he realizes its a dream, he helps me out of bed and to the living room, hands me a bowl and listens while I tell him the whole thing. 

Its a very scary thing to be so paralyzed and unable to wake up but knowing you sorta are awake.

22,Another strange house occurrence and one other...,1296146641,"After receiving some comments that I post some more stories from my house, I have decided to include a couple more. One deals directly with my house, another deals with the neighborhood I lived in.

So that damn creepy statue. My sister, friend and I were always extremely creeped out by it. Standing and looking at it, nothing seemed sinister or scary about it, but it was just a weird ass statue. 

So one night my friend and I are hanging out in my sister's room, which is above the garage on the third floor. Being that the house layout was fairly open, you can hear most of the things going on in the house, regardless of where you are at. The upstairs hallway extended from the garage roughly 45-50 feet away to the master bedroom. At the top of the stairs the hallway ended and opened into our ""grand"" entryway. The staircase went down a flight towards the open area off our kitchen. this area had two doors that opened on either side to front porches that run the length of the house on both sides. This is where the statue was located.

So we are in my sister's room, talking, when we hear things moving in the kitchen. We can hear some pots and pans moving around, and some cabinets opening and closing. Since our parents were out, we figured they had come home, although we didn't hear the garage open, and were basically sitting on top of it. 

I firmly believe in ghosts, the paranormal, aliens, etc., but I was a touch skeptical of the sounds due to the fact that pots and pans could shift around sometimes due to vibration. My sister and I kind of blow it off as that, but then my friend reminds us that the cabinets that the pots and pans are in are on roll out drawers. Our island in the kitchen had cabinets on both sides on the bottom, and my parents had them specifically made to have giant ""drawers"" that roll out for easy access. 

This then brought to our attention the worst part of all these noises- our mother keeps her kitchen spotless, and everything is organized. Organized to the point that all those pots and pans are stacked large to small, and fit into each other. So in reality, no vibrations should be clanking them around. The noises went on for 5-10 minutes with all of us too damn scared to even go to the top of the stairs, and then stopped. We never heard any noises like that again for the time we lived there.


My other story concerns the woods around our neighborhood. I feel bad giving specific locations or anything on here, but we lived in Elkhorn, Ne, and our neighborhood backed up to a wooded area off the Elkhorn river. From my house, the river was a 25 min mini hike through these woods. The neighborhood was closed to anyone who didn't live there, but all of us that did live there took advantage of these woods for camping, paintball, etc. There were campsites made by the homeowners association all over the place in them.

The best and most used campsite was one we all affectionately called the ""Meadow"". You went to the end of the neighborhood, found the barbed wire fence separating our neighborhood from a farmers land, and followed it straight back for 15 min or so. Not a bad hike, one or two areas where a small stream ran through and therefore would erode some areas out during different times of the year. Being stupid kids, we would set up camp, procure some booze, drink the night away and have a great time.

I think everyone is in agreement that wooded areas are terrifying at night. It is in our genetics. You don't go there :) So one night we are camping, and one of the girls with us needed to head back home to be up early in the morning. Her house was right at the end of the neighborhood, so no big deal. I was sober enough and still awake, so I agreed to walk her home quick.

The walk back is fine, decent moonlight so stupidly I don't bring a flashlight. Get her home, goodnight, and I start back. I am 5 minutes or so back into the woods on the path when I start hearing rustling in the brush to my left. To my left is the farmer's land. The woods were filled with deer and coyotes, so I figure no big deal, but I am getting spooked a bit, so I pick up the pace.

I then realize or bit later that when I picked up my pace, so did the rustling. So, mind racing, I tell myself ""sonicacid, check the ground. Leafy? It is just you. No worries"" Except the path was pretty barren. So it wasn't me. I started scanning the area a bit to see if it was some deer I disturbed, and I notice a shadow on my left in the farmer's land by a tree. I would say it was man-sized, and maybe it was, but my over-excited brain swore it was large. Bigfoot big. So I watched it for a bit, nothing happened, and I figured it was part of my imagination.

I keep walking, and am trying to keep an eye out for this shadow, and that is when I noticed it was keeping pace with me. If I walked fast, it would increase its speed. If I walked slow, it slowed down. Due to the narrowness of the trail, I could not run. I heard whatever this was snapping branches and rustling things the entire time. When I finally got to a point I could run, I went full sprint back to the campsite and woke up my friends who were sleeping and told them what happened.

Lately, he has been having, what i think is sleep paralysis. The 2nd time he had it, he tells us about his dreams all the time, he spoke of a ""shadow woman"" of such, cant exctly remember how he described it, but saying she was trying to get into his bed. Ever since he has told me this story, I placed a nightlight in his room (he's always been scared of the dark, and so have I, although I'm a bit better about it) and I check on him randomly throughout the night, If im still up doin homework or if I randomly wake-up some nights, I definitely check on him. I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary myself, but I believe every word he tells me. I live in an apartment complex in the better side of town and the only thing I can remember that may explain the ""shadow woman"" is I remember about hearing of woman passing in the complex I live, not sure of how long ago, but of natural causes...


The way he described the woman, he didn't sound scared about it, but was more like he just wanted to talk about it. No sure whatelse to think, but I always reassure him that there is NOTHING to be scared of and daddy and mommy are always here, no matter the time of day/night... and sorry if this isn't nosleep-ish, but just wanted opinions",nosleep,kingj1222,/r/nosleep/comments/f9u20/not_sure_if_im_being_overprotective_but_heres_my/

29,Paranormal Experiences I Have Had.,1296100259,"This won't be short. This isn't for you ""TL;DR"" people.

I am 15 years old. I live in Canada, and this has been going on for as long as I can remember.

Every single thing here is 100% true. I'm not sugarcoating anything, not making things more interesting. This is exactly what's been happening to me.

The first thing I remember (Keep in mind, this is all in the same house) is when I lived in my first room. I was about 7 years old. 

I was in bed early because I had to get up for school the next morning. I slept well, until I woke up in the middle of the night. I don't know what time it was, but it was late, because my parents were in bed. I woke up to a... well, it's hard to explain really. It was a shadow. But it was white, and it had no features. Just an outline of someone filled in with white. He had shaggy hair, from what I could tell, and he was wearing a hat. And he was just beside my bed. I woke up, so startled, I stared at him and didn't move until I eventually passed out. I woke up, and surprisingly, didn't tell anybody.

Another incident, I'm pretty sure it was soon after, was once again me waking up in the middle of the night. I did not know what time it was, but this time, I woke up and saw something as soon as I became conscience. I woke up, sat straight up, sweating, and saw my great grandmothers old blanket JUMP. Hard to explain, really, but it almost seemed like someone punched it with a 3 foot long arm through the floor upwards. THAT freaked me out. But, once again, I didn't tell anybody the next morning.

I was scared shitless to sleep, mind you.

The next thing I remember is when I woke up to SOUNDS. It's easy to describe, really.

""AHHHHHHHHHGGGHGHGGHHH""

Not loud. Just a soft moan. Not in pleasure, but in distress. Like a banshee, I suppose.

That happened several times. I even called my stepdad in, and he didn't hear a thing. I eventually passed out. 

This is the last experience I had as a young child. It's the only time I had EVER fallen out of bed.
Thing is, I didn't fall. It was almost as if I was thrown. My mom happened to be up and in the bathroom, and my room is across from the bathroom. She opened the door, asked if I was okay, etc.

I don't remember much. I never do when I'm too tired.

But I remember me being MUCH too far from my bed to have just ""fallen out"".

Fast forward a few years, into my third room I lived in (Not a lot happened in my second room), and you'll find me in my basement. I moved down there just after I turned 14. 

This is why I refuse to sleep down there.

Before I tell you about my incidences, you know that period of a few minutes in between being asleep and conscience? As if you're floating, and on occasion, waking up with the room spinning, or something like that?

That's when I was disturbed the most.

First incident: A few friends were spending the night. They are twin brothers, and one of them had the iPod that could take video. Well, we filmed all our good times, of us just doing stuff that we do. Nothing productive, but enough to keep us entertained. We watched the videos we took, and in each and every single one of them, there was a faint ringing. For example:

Twin 1: ""Hey man, I was playing Halo one time""

Twin 2: ""Oh yeah?""

Me: ""Is Halo all you play?""

*Ring*

Like that. Happened several times. Freaked us right out.

Second incident: I was sleeping in my basement like normal, when suddenly I woke up, extremely startled.

I looked at my alarm clock. It was spinning, shifting around, dancing all over the table beside my bed. It's a rather large alarm clock, too. The noise was unbearable. I bolted upstairs, and woke my parents up. My mother has always been caring, and she understood. She's had experiences like this as well as a child. We watched TV until I went back to bed and dozed off.

Third incident: I woke up, in between being conscience and asleep, like I told you. This is the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.

I woke up. And something whispered at me. 

I bolted up, and I remember thinking ""What the FUCK was that!?"". I got up, turned on my light, and tried convicing myself it was my imagination. Which is hard for me, I tend to jump to conclusions. But I really didn't want that to be true. I was almost ready to go back again when, with my lights on and everything, I heard it again. It was soft, like someone whispering in your ear. It KILLED me. I'm so fascinated with all this, yet I could never approach something like it. I never figured out what they said. It sounded like it was right over my shoulder.

And it was, I imagine. It was colder then the south pole down there.

That could be normal, mind you. It is, after all, a basement.

31,The Christmas Season,1296089401,"Three years before I was born, my mother and father had their first child.  He lived for a mere 7 minutes before his breathing stopped and he died.  I have never inquired as to what caused him to stop breathing.  A little over a year after this terrible incident, my parents had a daughter, and then two years after her, I was born.  Naturally, my parents had no reason to tell me about my older brother when I was younger, and even as we all got older, the story was never told to me, presumably because it was too painful to recall.  If the following events had never occurred, I might have never found out about him at all.

In early December during my junior year of high school, the family gathered ‘round the Christmas tree to load it up with the ornaments we had gathered over the years.  Our family had continued to grow after my birth; my parents had added another son and daughter.  My parents had bought each of us an ornament each year, so after adding those to the stockpile that they had owned before we were born, we always had one hell of a time fitting all of the ornaments onto the tree.  This year was no different.  But we pushed and we slid and shoved and eventually found some green for all of them.  In addition to the ornaments, we had a fairly nice manger set that was placed underneath the tree.  It had the whole damn birth party, and of course contained a wooden crib in which the figurine of baby Jesus lay.  After my siblings and I had set this up, we stood for a minute or two and admired our work, and then we each went our separate ways and on with life.

A day after setting the tree up, I walked into the living room to find one of my ornaments on the ground.  It was the first ornament that had been given to me and had “First Born Son” etched into its face.  The bright bronze had become cloudy over the years, but the ornament was sentimental, so it always managed to find a prominent place on the tree.  I found the spot I thought it had fallen from and re-hung it before walking through the room.  I passed through the room the next day to find the ornament again on the ground, and again I hung it up.  I tried to hang it in a different spot this time, assuming the weight had allowed it to slide from a thin branch, but to no avail, as it was on the ground the following day as well.  I placed it back on the tree, and was not too surprised when I came in the next day to find the ornament missing from the spot.  What did surprise me, however, was that the ornament was not on the ground, but was instead sitting on the coffee table a few feet away.  I assumed my mother was having the same problem with the ornament and had just given up and placed in on the table, so I stopped in the kitchen to ask her about it.

She was doing the dishes, and when I asked, she turned around and with a funny look on her face and told me that she too had been picking the ornament up each time she walked into the room.  For the next few days, each time I walked into the room, I continued to find the ornament off of the tree.  But now the location had changed.  It was no longer lying in random spots on the floor or on the table like it had been before.  Each time I walked in the room now, the ornament was inside of the roofed manager, leaning against the crib with the Jesus figure.  I was young, and I’m sure that didn’t help prevent me from thinking that things were adding up a little strangely.  It seems really stupid now, but I grew up in a semi-religious family and something about finding my “First Born Son” ornament leaning against Jesus every day appeared to me to be a harbinger of something evil that would cometh my way.

The non-surprising thing is, nothing ever happened to me.  Obvious, I suppose.  But my dad – my no-nonsense, get out of my face with your stupid paranormal bullshit, I’m just going to go into this scary dark room to get the toolbox, mysterious moaning be damned – had something happen to him.  

He tended to work in his basement office until the wee hours of the morning.  Most of that time was actually filled with him sleeping in his chair, as evidenced by him springing up and feigning awareness every time I would go into the basement late at night.  In the early hours of the morning of December 23rd, he was, as usual, down in the basement.  Around 2 AM, he was awakened by footsteps crossing down the first floor hallway above his head.  He decided he would come up and see who was up, and then continue upstairs to bed.  As he came up the basement stairs, he could hear the person walking through the kitchen on the other side of the door, but when he opened it, the person had just crossed into the dining room.   He followed the steps through the kitchen and around the bend but again was too late; the footsteps had beat him around the turn and into the living room.  He rounded the corner and was surprised to see an empty room and no longer hear the footsteps.  From the other room they had appeared to stop at the Christmas tree.  As he stood there, scanning the space and trying to figure out what he had heard, he noticed an object lying on the ground towards the middle of the room.  As he walked up to it and started bending over, he realized there were actually two objects lying in the middle of the living room floor: baby Jesus and the “First Born Son” ornament that was lying against his side.

The next day, my dad told all of us the story at breakfast.  My parents must have known that I was feeling a little unsettled from it all, so they decided to finally tell me what they had kept a secret for 16 years.  They told me about their happiness at getting pregnant, the nine long and exciting months my mom had carried my brother, and their feeling of complete desolation and absolute loss when he died.  They told me how it still hurt, especially around the holidays.  At first I assumed this was because everyone becomes sentimental around the holidays.  Then they told me the real reason: my brother had been born, and died, on December 23rd at 2 AM.  Last night had been the 20th anniversary of his death.",nosleep,plat00n,/r/nosleep/comments/f9pc2/the_christmas_season/
32,My strange first post...,1296089078,"So I am new to all of this, and will try to keep it short. 

Back in high school, I was not 16 yet and therefore couldn't drive, but my best friend was. Therefore, he would drive me to school and home again. (He lived 3 houses down from me.) You wouldn't think my house would be haunted, being that it was barely 8 years old and freshly built by my family, but I always seemed to have strange experiences there.

So, to give you all some visual imagery here, we had a awesome, large house. You entered through a door that took you into the garage, but then immediately to your right was the entrance into our family room. Since it was a nice, new house, and cost quite a bit of money, my parents had installed an ADT alarm system as well. The keypad to disarm it and arm it was right inside this door. Straight ahead was an open walkway into our kitchen/main entryway/hallway to the stairs. Right off to the left of the kitchen was the door to our laundry room. The nature of the alarm system made it so we needed to lock up our dog in the laundry room whenever you left, as the motion sensors would trip if he was free. 

My sister, friend and I always chalked up the strange occurrences to a creepy as hell statue my parents bought when furnishing the house. They are huge antique hunters, and they found a solid bronze statue of a ""flapper"" girl, who was nicknamed ""Tude"" by the inscription on the base. All in all, not a creepy statue, until we found that the right sleeve of her dress was actually not only a sleeve, but also the face and beard of a creepy old man. Not cool. (Plus the statue was partially hollow, so who knows what was inside of it)

As always, my dog was locked up. As always, when you entered the house and the alarm started sounding, he would bang against the laundry door, knowing that someone was home, and that he would be let out soon. So que the insanity.

My friend and I enter the house. He steps in, I step in, I turn around to disarm the alarm. My dog is banging against the laundry room door. At this time, we hear footsteps. Not just footsteps. Running footsteps. From the top of our three story stairs, all the way down to the basement. You cannot see the stairs from the door we entered, but you could see someone running down them as they appeared around the kitchen wall and back down the stairs again. So, we hear the footsteps, wondering what is going on, and turn in time to see *something* running down the stairs into the basement.

Any mind at this point might chalk it up to hearing and seeing things, but then we both realize my dog has gone quiet. And then we heard my dog growling. He was a mixed bag mut from the pound, half Schnauzer, half whatever the hell else. Not super imposing. Plus, he never growls. 

Sadly, we bailed on my poor dog as both of us were scared shitless, ran to his house to tell his parents. His parents weren't home. He and his father are huge hunting freaks, so we grab a couple of handguns and work up the courage over the next 20 minutes to go back and at least save my dog. -Honestly, at this point we thought burglar, not ghost.

We head back, let my dog out, and proceed room to room through my house checking closets and everything for an intruder. My dog acts fine the entire time, and we found nothing. All of the exterior doors were still locked from the inside. To this day, it still creeps me out and I cannot explain it. 

I may add some other stories later on from that same house and neighborhood, as that was not the only experience.

33,Experience I had in high school. ,1296088387,"When I was in high school there was a kid who hung out with our group of friends named zack and he committed suicide. A couple days follow the suicide I get a phone call from one of my good buddies and he was telling me how his moms friend was at his house and was able to communicate with the dead. He continued to tell me that she said zack was talking to her and telling her to say hi to us, I did not believe a word of it, I just assumed the lady was some whacko chick.
The second I hung up the phone the surround sound that was hooked up to the stereo came on max 99 volume. I nearly shat my self, I ran straight the fuck out of the house, my heart pumping as fast as it ever has. After a minute I went back inside and turned it off. 
Two things to note are the remote for the system was in the cabinet with it so me the cat or dog couldn't have pressed it by accident, and there is no way my parents would have had it up to the max volume on its previous use. Thinking about it to this day still gives me chills.

34,"As old as the internet, but still gets me every time: Black Eyed Kids",1296080717,"In 1998, journalist Brian Bethel posted this story to a ghost discussion newsgroup:

---

I don't really know what I'd call this story if I was submitting it for publication in Fate or something of its ilk. ""Brian vs. the Evil, Black-eyed, Possibly Vampiric or Demonic But At Least Not Bloody Normal Kids"" doesn't have much of a ring to it. (Shrug.) :)

But that's at least an accurate title.

As so many things do, it all started out innocently.

My Internet Service Provider used to have offices in a shopping center before they moved to their (comparatively) lush accommodations elsewhere. There was a drop box at that original location. The monthly bill was due, and thus, there but for the Grace of the Net I went.

It was about 9:30 p.m. when I left. From my relatively isolated apartments, it's about 10-15 minutes or so to downtown (Abilene has a population of about 110,000).

Right next to Camalott Communications' old location is a $1.50 movie theater. At the time, the place was featuring that masterwork of modern film, Mortal Kombat. I drove by the theater on the way into the center proper and pulled into an empty parking space.

Using the glow of the marquee to write out my check, I was startled to hear a knock on the driver's-side window of my car.

I looked over and saw two children staring at me from street. I need to describe them, with the one feature (you can guess what it was) that I didn't realize until about half-way through the conversation cleverly omitted.

Both appeared to be in that semi-mystical stage of life children get into where you can't exactly tell their age. Both were boys, and my initial impression is that they were somewhere between 10-14.

Boy No. 1 was the spokesman. Boy No. 2 didn't speak during the entire conversation -- at least not in words.

Boy No. 1 was slightly taller than his companion, wearing a pull-over, hooded shirt with a sort of gray checked pattern and jeans. I couldn't see his shoes. His skin was olive-colored and had curly, medium-length brown hair. He exuded an air of quiet confidence.

Boy No. 2 had pale skin with a trace of freckles. His primary characteristic seemed to be looking around nervously. He was dressed in a similar manner to his companion, but his pull-over was a light green color. His hair was a sort of pale orange.

They didn't appear to be related, at least directly.

""Oh, great,"" I thought. ""They're gonna hit me up for money."" And then the air changed.

I've explained this before, but for the benefit of any new lurkers out there, right before I experience something strange, there's a change in perception that comes about which I describe in the above manner. It's basically enough time to know it's too late. ;)

So, there I was, filling out a check in my car (which was still running) and in a sudden panic over the appearance of two little boys. I was confused, but an overwhelming sense of fear and unearthliness rushed in nonetheless.

The spokesman smiled, and the sight for some inexplicable reason chilled my blood. I could feel fight-or-flight responses kicking in. Something, I knew instinctually, was not right, but I didn't know what it could possibly be.

I rolled down the window very, very slightly and asked ""Yes?""

The spokesman smiled again, broader this time. His teeth were very, very white.

""Hey, mister, what's up? We have a problem,"" he said. His voice was that of a young man, but his diction, quiet calm and ... something I still couldn't put my finger on ... made my desire to flee even greater. ""You see, my friend and I want to see the films, but we forgot our money,"" he continued. ""We need to go to our house to get it. Want to help us out?""

Okay. Journalists are required to talk to lots of people, and that includes children. I've seen and spoken to lots of them. Here's how that usually goes:

""Uh ... M ... M ... Mister? Can I see that camera? I ... I won't break it or anything. I promise. My dad has a camera, and he lets me hold it sometimes, I guess, and I took a picture of my dog -- it wasn's very good, 'cause I got my finger in the way and ...""

Add in some feet shuffling and/or body swaying and you've got a typical kid talking to a stranger.

In short, they're usually apologetic. People generally teach children that when they talk to adults, they're usually bothering them for one reason or another and they should at least be polite.

This kid was in no way fitting the mold. His command of language was incredible and he showed no signs of fear. He spoke as if my help was a foregone conclusion. When he grinned, it was as if he was trying to say, ""I know something ... and you're NOT gonna like it. But the only way you're going to find out what it is will be to do what I say ...""

""Uh, well ..."" was the best reply I could offer.

Now here's where it starts to get strange.

The quiet companion looked at the spokesman with a mixture of confusion and guilt on his face. He seemed in some ways shocked, not with his friend's brusque manner but that I didn't just immediately open the door.

He eyed me nervously.

The spokesman seemed a bit perturbed, too. I still was registering something wrong with both.

""C'mon, mister,"" the spokesman said again, smooth as silk. Car salesmen could learn something from this kid. ""Now, we just want to go to our house. And we're just two little boys.""

That really scared me. Something in the tone and diction again sent off alarm bells. My mind was frantically trying to process what it was perceiving about the two figures that was ""wrong.""

""Eh. Um ...."" was all I could manage. I felt myself digging my fingernails into the steering wheel.

""What movie were you going to see?"" I asked finally.

""Mortal Kombat, of course,"" the spokesman said. The silent one nodded in affirmation, standing a few paces behind.

""Oh,"" I said. I stole a quick glance at the marquee and at the clock in my car. Mortal Kombat had been playing for an hour, the last showing of the evening.

The silent one looked increasingly nervous. I think he saw my glances and suspected that I might be detecting something was not above-board.

""C'mon, mister. Let us in. We can't get in your car until you do, you know,"" the spokesman said soothingly. ""Just let us in, and we'll be gone before you know it. We'll go to our mother's house.""

We locked eyes.

To my horror, I realized my hand had strayed toward the door lock (which was engaged) and was in the process of opening it. I pulled it away, probably a bit too violently. But it did force me to look away from the children.

I turned back. ""Er ... Um ...,"" I offered weakly and then my mind snapped into sharp focus.

For the first time, I noticed their eyes.

They were coal black. No pupil. No iris. Just two staring orbs reflecting the red and white light of the marquee.

At that point, I know my expression betrayed me. The silent one had a look of horror on his face in a combination that seemed to indicate: A) The impossible had just happened and B) ""We've been found out!""

The spokesman, on the other hand, wore a mask of anger. His eyes glittered brightly in the half-light.

""Cmon, mister,"" he said. ""We won't hurt you. You have to LET US IN. We don't have a gun ...""

That last statement scared the living hell out of me, because at that point by his tone he was plainly saying, ""We don't NEED a gun.""

He noticed my hand shooting down toward the gear shift. The spokesman's final words contained an anger that was complete and whole, and yet contained in some respects a tone of panic:

""WE CAN'T COME IN UNLESS YOU TELL US IT'S OKAY. LET ... US .... IN!""

I ripped the car into reverse (thank goodness no one was coming up behind me) and tore out of the parking lot. I noticed the boys in my peripheral vision, and I stole a quick glance back.

They were gone. The sidewalk by the theater was deserted.

I drove home in a heightened state of panic. Had anyone attempted to stop me, I would have run on through and faced the consequences later.

I bolted into my house, scanning all around -- including the sky.

What did I see? Maybe nothing more than some kids looking for a ride.

And some really funky contacts. Yeah, right.

A friend suggested they were vampires, what with the old ""let us in"" bit and my compelled response to open the door. That and the ""we'll go see our mother"" thing.

I'm still not sure what they were, but here's an epilogue I find chilling:

I talk about Chad a lot. He's still my best friend, my best ghost-hunting companion and an all-around cool guy. He recently moved to Amarillo, but at the time this happened was still living in San Angelo of Ram Page fame.

I called him and talked to him briefly. He had two female friends with him at the time, both professing some type of psychic ability.

I started telling him the story, leaving out the part about the black eyes for the kicker. One of the women (we were on a speakerphone) stopped me.

""These children had black eyes, right?"" she asked. ""I mean, all-black eyes?""

""Er ... Yes."" I said. I was a bit taken aback.

""Hmmm,"" she said. ""One night last week, I had a dream about children with black eyes. They were outside my house, wanting to be let in, but there was something wrong with them. It took me a while to realize it was the eyes.""

I hadn't even gotten as far as them wanting to come in.

""What did you do?"" I asked.

""I kept the doors and windows locked,"" she said. ""I knew if they came in, they would kill me.""

She paused.

""And they would have killed you, too, if you had let them into your car."" ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f9mk9/as_old_as_the_internet_but_still_gets_me_every/

36,My Watcher...,1296077418,"I’m relatively new to Reddit and consequently, NoSleep, but my husband has egged me on to post this story for a while now so here it is. It makes me a little uncomfortable to share, as this memory has haunted me my entire life. 

I’ve always been what my father deems a “spiritually sensitive” person, which is a nice way of saying I’ve always been the subject of weird often unexplainable events. If I’m truly honest with myself I’ve always felt I attracted a different type of attention, a dark kind of attention. I believe in Angels, Demons, Ghosts, Boogiemen and all matter of things that live on a plane of existence that weaves close to our own because at some point in my life I feel I have encountered all of them.  This story however is about the night I saw my Watcher. 
I call him that because for the life of me, I don’t know what else to call him. I’ve looked for similar stories online to see if he harkens to a specific mythical type but no dice. I call him my Watcher because…  well, I’ll share my story and let you all draw your own conclusions. This story is 100% true, it’s a memory burned so deep in my mind that I remember it as if it was yesterday.

I was five years old, a young age, but very important because this is the age in which you start to collect your earliest memories. I’ve always been under the impression that children are more open to the comings and goings of the spiritual realm – monsters in the closet, imaginary friends, fear of things under that bed – even if children aren’t taught to have these habits they seem to develop them, you have to wonder why...
 
I was five years old; it was the middle of the night when I woke up with a start in the room I shared with my twin sister. I remember looking over at her and I noticing she was still asleep, but what had woken me up?  I remember my eyes being drawn to the large bay window at the foot of my bed. It was a bright night; the moon combined with the streetlight out front was casting a bright glow across my covers as I crept closer to the window, with the bizarre impulse to look outside onto the street below...

The view from my window was that of our front yard, bordered by out driveway on the left leading down to the street that ran through our block. I quietly crept forward and peaked out into the night. The yard was quiet, no lights were on in any of our neighbor’s houses, which led me to the conclusion it was very late at night. I let my eyes drift over the quiet stillness outside when I saw Him.

I actually have to pause here, describing him has always made me uncomfortable, to this day. It causes a weird reaction me, my eyes tend to well up and I get very antsy. 

Standing at the base of our driveway, was a Man. He was standing in the light of the streetlight, lingering next to our garbage cans (it was trash night, they were down by the corner to get picked up in the morning). He was tall, at least 6’, he was standing with his hands in the pockets of a long tan trench coat his was wearing and there was a fedora pulled low over his face. He was just standing there. 

I froze. Being a child of the 90’s “stranger danger” was running through my mind. Who was this man? Was he a burglar? A Kidnapper? (A childhood fear of mine) I was motionless; unable to call and wake either my parents sleeping down the hall, or my sister slumbering a few feet away. I lay there in my jammies, watching the man watch my house. (For this is what I realized he was doing, nothing else, just lingering, hands in pockets, all his attention devoted to my house) 

And suddenly without warning, HE became aware he was being watched, and slowly, so very slowly, he turned his head and looked me right in the eyes. He had no face. Nothing, simply a shadowy black void – yet right in the middle of that blackness, his eyes burned a terrible bright red. I felt my own eyes widen in horror, for when he looked at me, I felt as if his eyes were piercing straight to my soul – I knew he could see me, and for some reason that though filled me with icy terror – whatever that thing was in front of my house, I knew deep down it was evil and THAT scared me most of all. 

The eye contact couldn’t have lasted more than a second before I flung myself back under the covers, grabbing my stuffed animals and willing myself to go back to sleep. I lay there in the dark – terrified because I knew, deep down, he hadn’t vanished or blended into the darkness.  With startling clarity for a five year old, I knew He was still there if I found the courage to go back and look…

I woke the next morning and checked outside.  Just the garbage cans, nothing else. Oddly, I told no one. I still don’t know why. I felt I had seen something I was not supposed to see, and kept it to myself until a couple of years ago, when I was in college. One night, while visiting home, when my mom and I were half way through a bottle of wine - I told her what I had seen 15 years ago. 

She looked startled and shaken. After some discussion and the expected comment of “You’re sure you weren’t just dreaming?” she told me she believed me. I remember thinking it was weird, finally telling someone what I’d seen, because given that I’d never talked about it or mentioned it (and done my best to forget it) - I could still recall the incident with crystal clarity.

I know for a fact he was watching my house. For what? I don’t know. Perhaps it was for my sister and I, perhaps He was interested in my newborn baby brother sleeping by my parent’s bed. Perhaps just curiosity…. Perhaps… What if…. Maybe... Whatever the case, whenever I wake up in the night and feel compelled to look out my window, I close my eyes, tug down the blinds and roll over to wait for morning…

40,Strange event that happened to the girlfriend,1296067669,"


It was about 10:00PM when my girlfriend decided to go to bed. Most nights, i opt to stay up and play video games so i can play uninterrupted.

She said she fell quickly asleep as i remained in the living room playing my games, and said she slept pretty peacefully. The next morning she asked if i was sleeping on the floor. I laughed and told her ""no, why would i?"" Her face then got very somber looking and her voice got very quiet. She said she had woken up when she hit me in the head and looked over to see me leaning up against the bed with only the top of my head visible. She swears she wasn't dreaming because she touched and felt my hair. I insisted it wasn't me for I had fallen asleep on the couch while watching Netflix, and never came into the room that night.

42,Dread in the bedroom.,1296047514,"Over the years my boyfriend and I have made it a point to seek out anything that might be paranormal.  We frequent haunted spots (lots of stories for another day) and we love books, tv shows and movies that exhibit a certain ""fright factor"".  I've always enjoyed the rush it gave you.  That feeling of not knowing.... That sense that comes over you when you're on your toes.... The rush basically.  That is until it hit home.  The feeling isn't fun when you feel on edge in your comfort zone... at least not after a while.  

My story begins when my boyfriend and I move into his grandparents home.  The house is 100 years old, but has been well cared for.  It needed some upkeep, as any old house does, but it was something that we looked forward to.  The first level has always had a very homey feel to it.  It's the kind of feeling that you get when you walk into a house with fresh bread baking in the oven.  People always comment on how the kitchen feels like his grandmother is still there baking (she has passed away quite a few years ago now).  And although we have since remodelled, the feeling never seemed to have left.  

The second level however is a completely different story.  There are very few people who are willing to go to our bathroom without having the upstairs hall lights on (even though the bathroom is quite literally at the top of the stairs and walk straight).  Family members, friends, etc refuse to head up there in the dark.  If they have to for some reason they literally RUN.  Why you might ask?  It's hard to pinpoint.  No one can give you a straight answer to be honest.  It's a feeling that they get.  Like there's someone constantly staring at you... following you... The feeling you get when someone is playing shadow behind your back.  

I tried my best not to pay attention to it when I moved in.  I convinced myself that it was just because the place was old... that it was silly... that you were freaked out because others were freaked out.  It didn't take me long to get freaked out myself though.  

Have you ever been asleep and woken up because you could feel someone staring at you?  Have you ever been nervous to sleep on your side because the moment you turned your back you could feel someone behind you?  That's what it's like.  I sleep watching the door from my back, and I've never slept on my back in my entire life.  The sensation you get is overwhelming.  It's very difficult to ignore.  Even my boyfriend, who is a HUGE skeptic senses things.  It's like your shadow comes alive and watches you from the darkness in which it finds itself.  

I'm unsure if the two events are related or not, but I found out that while his grandparents lived there, they took care of a old fellow with diminished mental capacity.  Turns out he took a heart attack and died on the floor of our bathroom.  Could he be the sense that we feel?  Everyone who knew him says definitely not because he was so friendly and nice to everyone.  But here's where I find things getting strange.

Have you ever heard that dogs have a sixth sense?  Well, our 3 year old german shepherd mix seems to.  He sees things in the hallway some nights.  He's not a barker, not on edge at all and ridiculously friendly to everyone.  This dog might seriously lick someone to death some day and that would be it.  But in the middle of the night he will get up from his dog bed (at the foot of our bed), plant four feet at the doorway, tilt his head downwards and begin growling.... at nothing... at the dark space outside the door.  If we growl him and tell him to go and lay down, he will, but he does not go back to sleep.  He simply stares into the space.  

Second part of his strange actions happened about a year ago.  I was cleaning up a few things in a spare bedroom (which coincidentally was  the bedroom of the old fellow I had mentioned earlier.  I had been moving things around in there, putting up a new bookshelf, etc.  My dog was laying in the porch downstairs when he decided to RUN upstairs to the room where I was.  He did not enter the room.  Instead he began to bark furiously and jump in the air.  I've never seen a reaction like this in him before, nor have I seen it since.  When I left the room to calm him he reacted to me and began licking me and whining.  I figured he was ok so I went back into the room and he began doing the exact same thing again.  In three years I've never witnessed this dog jump but he was jumping and barking and basically taking the fit of his life each time I walked into that room.  It didn't take me long to leave.

This brings me to my ""fix"".  One night I decided I would confront whatever was in the house.  I had a ""talk"" and basically said that I wanted it to leave and that it wasn't welcome here anymore.  It needed to ""move on"". etc.  I ended with a statement that if they felt they had no where else to go, and that this was as much their home, then we had to live in peace and they were not allowed to bother us anymore.  No more scaring anyone, watching anyone, etc.  They had to be on their own 100%. No idea if this would make any difference or not.

About two weeks after this I was sitting in bed eating cereal for breakfast.  A normal morning routine for me.  There's a window at the end of our bed that I look out and I see this short man walking through our back yard by the tree line.  It puzzled me but there are often people in our yard because we run a business there, so at first I didn't think anything of it.  Then I realized it was 5 am and could not fathom why anyone would be there at that time.  I started shaking my boyfriend awake to tell him someone was outside.  As soon as he woke up the figure walking in the back yard seemed to disappear.  I thought maybe he walked behind something or fell down, but there was nothing there but an empty field of green grass once again.  It REALLY freaked me out!

I described what I saw to my boyfriend.  The height, the limp, the clothing.  He simply shrugged his shoulders and said that it sure did sound like the old fellow his grandparents took care of.  Similar coat to what was well known to be his favourite.  The limp.  The height.  etc.  This was a man that I had NEVER met, nor ever seen a picture of.  All I knew was that he lived there, died there, and sometimes ""babysat"" my boyfriend.  

Long story comes to an end.  The house seldom feels ""creepy"" anymore.  People are no longer scared to go upstairs, even though I told them nothing about what happened to me or what I did.  People just seemed to have started going upstairs despite it being dark, they have no problem walking up to the bathroom in the dark now, and no one mentions being ""watched"" anymore.  

Still though, on rare occasions, I get a strange feeling that I'm not alone, and some nights my dog still lets our a low growl.",nosleep,immachicklette,/r/nosleep/comments/f9bwo/dread_in_the_bedroom/
43,Endless Nightmares,1296046988,"When I was a child paranormal experiences were nothing new to me. They happen often enough that I have come to embrace them as just another unpleasant part of life. Here are some of my experiences in the order of significance to me. All of this is true so feel free to ask questions.

The earliest phenomena happened while my mother was still pregnant with me. 

My parents had a two bedroom apartment in The Bronx in New York City. My 7 month pregnant mother was home alone trying to get some restful sleep. She says it was pretty early in the morning and I was keeping her up with repeated kicks. She was lying there waiting for me to stop when suddenly the light in the other bedroom turned on.

My father was working a late shift at the hospital and wasn't due back until morning. Assuming it was someone trying to rob us she slipped out of bed grabbed the phone to call 911 and hid in the closet. As she waited for the police, terrified, the light turned off and then back on 3 times. When the police finally knocked she sprinted through the apartment to let them in. She says she never looked in to see who or what was there but as she ran past the room the light turned off one final time. Two heavily armed cops searched the entire apartment and found no evidence of a break in. I guess I forgot to mention it but the room with the light had just finished being furnished for me. My parents and the police chalked it up to being faulty wiring but I know better. That was just the first time wiring suddenly became faulty around me.

When we lived in Florida I was 10, home alone after school, and watching tv. It was close to Christmas so the house was decorated as such. Out of nowhere on a brilliantly sunny December day a deafening lightning bolt struck outside the window behind me.

Instantly afterward I could hear loud heavy footsteps upstairs, then the tv turned to gibberish, and all the Christmas decorations turned on. I ran and hid under the Christmas tree behind the presents until my parents got home. Again it was attributed to faulty wiring.

When I was 5 my family lived in Texas. I was obsessed with dinosaurs. I was sure there were T-rexes buried in my backyard and tried to dig them up like any overzealous 5 year old would. I had one of those [invisible dog leashes](http://i.imgur.com/XlCpS.jpg) but for me it was an invisible dinosaur named Lizzy. I took Lizzy everywhere she was my imaginary friend. I always hung Lizzy up by my door before bed.

One night I woke up glued to my bed. I was utterly unable to move, scream, breathe, or even cry. Standing over me was Lizzy's empty collar. I was overjoyed that my best friend had come to life to protect me until to my horror instead of protecting me she started attacking me. I could feel bites all over my body. Eventually everything faded into black.

When I woke up Lizzy was draped across the foot of my bed.

My mom asked me where the scratches on my face came from. I told her I didn't know. 

I never played with Lizzy again.

The final experience I'll leave here happened in North Carolina when I was 14.

I woke up again in the middle of the night unable to move glued to my bed. This time it wasn't a toy above me...this time there was a little boy standing on my ceiling staring at me. He wasn't like any of the others. 

My room was freezing cold and the light from my closet shone through him and refracted around my room as if he were made of crystal or more likely, ice. He stood there upside down on my ceiling for what seemed like an eternity until he suddenly smiled at me and then shattered into a million pieces.

As soon as he shattered the warmth returned to my room and I could move again. Since that night 7 years ago I have had nothing but nightmares. Not a single good dream. Either nightmares or empty black sleep. I just want to know...has any of this happened to anyone else...or as I fear am I the only one.

44,Sleep well...,1296045255,"When I was younger, probably around 10 or 11, my reflection would change when I looked at myself in the mirror in the dark.  I used to have a bad habit of drinking Coke right before going to bed and I would always wake up in the middle of the night having to take a leak.  My parents' house had this huge mirror-wall in our bathroom and nothing has scared me more then the night I saw myself become something...else.

I woke up and looked at the clock - ""Shit, 3am?""  I hated walking down the hallway in the dark.  It wasn't the dark that scared me but rather what could be lurking around the next corner.  I could see the night-light in the bathroom casting its luminous security into the hallway so I just held my breath and quick-walked towards it.

When I got to the bathroom, I flicked the switch -- nothing happened. ""Come on, man...fix the light"" I thought to myself, remembering that my mom had asked me to replace the bulb earlier that day.  I was too busy playing video games or watching TV to be bothered...I was really kicking myself now.  The night-light was making it just possible to see without pissing all over the floor.  I felt a kind of warm, humid breeze on the back of my neck and heard something faintly behind me.  

As I glanced over my shoulder, I could have sworn I saw my reflection in the mirror take a second longer to turn around.  Now I heard the sound ot my pee hitting the toilet seat so I snapped back and paid attention to the task at hand.  I finished up and flushed and prepared myself for the journey back down the pitch-black hallway.  As I was walking out of the bathroom, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my reflection had stopped.  

It took a second to process as I was already out in the hall when I realized what I had seen.  I turned slowly, afraid to look, and peered in through the bathroom door.  My reflection was still in the mirror, just staring blankly.  I crept closer, my reflection not moving an inch.  As I got to the bathroom and rest my foot on the transition, my reflection turned to me and grinned, its eyes becoming empty voids and its hair growing into thin wiry strands.  It seemed to stare not just at me, but at my soul as it mouthed the words ""sleep well.""  I bolted down the hall and into my parents' room, diving under their cover and nearly giving them and my dog a heart attack.",nosleep,TG_Alibi,/r/nosleep/comments/f9biz/sleep_well/

46,Visit From Grandpa,1296031570,"So this is more sweet then creepy to me.

So my grandfather died after being in the hospital a few times he had leukemia and knew he was going for a while. He was always sure to be nice to me and even made arrangements with my dad for a spoken will. None of us were surprised when he went but of course deeply saddened. I didn't go to the funeral but wanted to badly to say good-bye to him once and for all. Anyways my dad, his 2 brothers, one of their wives and I cleared out his house going through everything. My grandmother had died when my dad was 9 for the record so that is why she is not mentioned. My dad asks if he can take the dinning room table and chairs, very 70's looking but some good solid pieces of furniture. We take it home, set it up and use it as our own in the corner of the kitchen, just like Grandpa used to.

So one day I get a microwave breakfast sandwich outta the freezer and goto microwave it, my back turned to the table. Then I hear this horrible SCREEECH!!! And spin around to see my grandpa sitting there in the chair with a faint smile on his lips, looking straight at me. He's semi-transparent, but fairly solid. Wearing his usual clothing which was a button up short sleeved shirt and slacks. Hands on his knees like he always did to look at me being the short lil munchkin I was.
I freak out, i'm more happy then scared.
My dad wakes up I ask him if he left the chair pointing toward the microwave, with it's back to the table, dad looks at me like i'm crazy.
The chairs are almost completely metal with plastic backs, weight easily 30-5o lbs each and DO NOT MOVE EASILY, think grinding rust. There is no way the wind could have moved it. We had a little carin terrier at the time, way to small to move that.
I can think of no other explanation.
My dad even jokes that he thought Grandpa would pester him afterwards rather then me.
But I never got to say good-bye till then.

I seem to remember there being a dining table with plates and silverware set nicely and a couple chairs.

48,Why my brother refuses to sleep in the basement anymore.,1296028543,"Let me premise this by saying I don't really think I have a house that should even consider harboring paranormal entities. I live in Colorado, in a small town suburb, in a house that's about 15 years old now.

Granted the town used to be a huge coal mining company town and I live backed up to open wilderness, but hey. New house. No shit to go down, first owners, finished basement, etc.

With that being said, I have went about the greater part of my life pretty darn secure with my living arrangements (and definitely more secure than I was when I lived in a massive creaking house on the east coast- scary shit definitely went down there).

Back to the main point. I digress too much. 
My brother is about ten years older than me. He's clean now, used to do a number of drugs, wasn't exactly proud of what he did. I can't help but thinking though, that this one night had something to do with his straight-laced behavior these days.

So yeah. He was visiting, and that was cool. When you're in the seventh grade and you can see your bro who's never around, it's always fun. Then this night happened.

I can only explain what happened as he told it to me, as I remember it years later. I've kind of blocked it out of my mind because it seemed too... off... to me to retain as a memory. He still remembers it to this day, though.

I come downstairs for some english muffins and cheesy eggs, as all good parents should make for their youths. My brother is already awake, apparently on his third coffee. I look at him. He looks like shit. And it's about ten in the A.M. Huge bags under his eyes. Not drug-induced. Pure insomnia.

Being the little shit that I was, I asked him, ""What, guest bed not good enough for you?""

And he gives me this look. And it's the kind of expression that you won't ever forget. He gives my mom the same look after she gives him the ""stop terrorizing my child"" look. (We're a family of people with ""looks"").

And then he tells me what happened. Listen:

""I was sleeping until 2:30 AM. I remember it because the alarm clock was the first thing I remember. I looked up. And it was black.""

""What do you mean black? The dark?""

""No... that's just it. It wasn't the darkness. There was this... thing above me. A black... mass. Above my head. I could see my hands, I could see around the room, but I couldn't see the ceiling. It was like light ceased to exist above me. It was cold. It didn't go away. And I felt so helpless.""

I didn't really know what to say. This was my big brother. six feet tall, muscular build, and he was shaking.

He stayed on the upstairs couch the rest of his trip, and to this day will not set foot in that basement. I've been down there, and I find it quite comfortable.

I don't know what he saw for sure, and it creeps the hell out of me to think about it, but I'm glad he did. The way he turned his life around after that, I think he saw his guardian angel.",nosleep,notzak,/r/nosleep/comments/f98z6/why_my_brother_refuses_to_sleep_in_the_basement/

52,My night at the Hotel St. Nicholas,1296006547,"Hello /nosleep/, I thought I would take a moment to write out my story for you all. It happened last month, and I’m still not sure what to think about it. It wasn’t incredibly terrifying (although maybe a little freaky), and I’m not sure I would jump to the conclusion that ghosts were involved, but I’ll just tell the tale and let you decide.

Last month, my girlfriend wanted to get out of town for a night. She had just finished her finals and really wanted to go do something fun. So, we packed up the car and headed to Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is about an hour and a half away. On the way, I called and made reservations for one night at a place I found online. We like to visit small, out of the way places, so I picked the [Hotel St. Nicholas]( http://www.hotelstnicholas.com/)

A little background – The place was converted to a hotel recently, but operated as a hospital for decades in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Cripple Creek was a Gold Rush town, and still has that kind of feel to it. In the winter, it is beautiful with snow and has a rustic mountain charm.

By the time we got to the hotel, it was dark and since it was a weeknight, we had the place virtually to ourselves. As soon as we got there, I loved the vibe of the place. It was quite old, poorly lit by wall scones, and had lots of character. The floors were original hardwood, and creaked whenever you took a step. The bar was tiny, but had a huge boiler plate and ancient gas controls mounted on the walls with pipes everywhere, which gave the whole place a rugged, almost steampunk character.

Aside from the gentleman on night duty (who was also the bartender), there was only one other room booked. We had the entire third floor to ourselves. The rooms had very high ceilings, and nice amenities.
We unpacked and headed downstairs to have a drink in the bar. There we met the other couple who were staying in the place that night, two elderly women. They had come to Denver for some business trip and had decided they wanted to see Cripple Creek. We chatted for a bit, then left to go to some of the casinos, which is really the main draw of Cripple Creek. It's the only place in Colorado (that I know of) where gambling is legal.

We gambled for a while, and downed some free drinks. By midnight, we were tired and decided to head to our room. We stumbled through the snow and walked up the road to get back to the St. Nicholas. When we got there, most of the lights were off, but we made it to the top of the stairs and found our room. The place felt deserted, and there were only a couple lights on in the whole hotel.

My girlfriend fell asleep almost immediately, but I am kind of a bitchy sleeper. The room didn’t have a fan, which I find puts me to sleep. So, I tossed and turned for a while, and eventually started to doze off. It was about that time when I heard a bell, far off in the building. It was a high pitched sound, like an old-fashioned hand bell that someone rich might have used to summon servants. It was soft, but was definitely a bell. My mind registered this, but I didn’t become consciously aware of anything until a few seconds later when I heard someone walking down the hall.

At that point, I started to become more alert, as some part of my brain told me this was odd. The floors were very creaky, and it was obvious that someone was walking down the hall, not at a brisk pace, but steady, as if they had someplace to go, and were moving with a purpose. When the steps got outside my door, they stopped.

At this point, I was fully awake, and alert. I knew there was nobody else on this floor. The room was dark, too dark to see any shadow or movement under the door into the outside hallway. There were no lights on in the hallway, and I didn’t want to turn one on in the room. I reached over and put my hand on the pocket knife I carry, and had placed on the bedside table. I had no idea what I was going to do. The door didn’t have a peephole in it, but I did not want to get up and look, anyway. I glanced at the clock – it was 2:36 in the morning. 
I waited there for what must have been about 20 seconds, unsure of what to do. Just as the clock switched to 2:37, I heard a faint scraping at the door. It was as if someone had put their hand on the door and gently pushed. At that point, my heart leaped up into my chest, and my grip tightened on my pocket knife. Just then, I heard the bell again, still far off, but more distinct this time. And, just as they had before, the footsteps started again and continued down the hall.

I waited until I heard the footsteps fade down the far end of the hall. I relaxed slightly, but did not release my grip on my pocketknife. At that point, it occurred to me that the end of the hall dead-ended in three rooms, and as far as I knew, there was no way out of them, aside from walking back past my door.
For a while, I continued to listen for more steps, but I heard nothing the rest of the night. I probably dozed off in the wee hours of the morning, but every time the hotel settled, or shifted, I would wake up and listen. I never heard the footsteps again, and didn’t get much sleep.

In the morning, I went outside the room and looked at the three rooms at the end of the hallway. All three doors were open, and their rooms seemed undisturbed, simply waiting for new occupants. At checkout, I spoke to the night watchman (who was still on duty, it turned out).
“Were you walking around the hotel last night?” 
He gave me a questioning look and said “No, I make my rounds at midnight, and then turn in until the morning.” 
“You ever see anything strange in this place?” I asked. 
He chuckled. “Well, I can’t say I ever saw a ghost, but this place has some strange happenings from time to time. I hear the bells every once in a while, and sometimes stuff gets shifted around in our storage rooms. They used to be the morgue of the hospital, and I don’t much like going in there.”
“Bells?” I asked. “What’s that about bells?”
“Well, that’s one of the queer things about this place.” He replied. “This place used to be a hospital. Back before you could push a button and get a nurse, the patients were given little bells they could jingle to get someone’s attention. I’ve heard them a few times when I’m up late.”
“Interesting.” I replied with a dull voice. I was remembering the bells I heard last night and the footsteps in the hallway…

There's my story, /nosleep/. I thought you would appreciate it, as it really happened. I can't prove anything, but it was certainly strange... Unless those old ladies were trolling me.

56,Activity in the house,1295992987,"After moving back into the house I grew up in, my family and I had started to notice some suspicious activity. About 3 years ago my mom died. It was horrible, but it wasn't exactly unexpected. She wasn't ready to die, and my dad wasn't ready to let her go. Everything seemed fine in the house up until around christmas time, which coincidentally was my moms favorite holiday. 

I was at home, visiting from college for a month. During that time the weirdest things started happening. I always felt that my mother kind of watched over my family, she said herself that she would if she happened to pass away. Tensions rose during christmas time, especially for my dad, who found it difficult during the holidays. 

 Because my father and brother had school and work, I was often the last one to go to bed. With out fail, every night at about 2 a.m. I would suddenly be filled with a sense of dread for no apparent reason. I've never been one to be scared of the dark, but during that time in my house I can honestly say I was. 

One day we decided to start hanging christmas ornaments on our tree, which had been left standing bare in a corner for quite some time. We had a huge argument and we were all basically screaming at each other. We were all sitting down when this happened, one of my brothers bb gun pellets shot out of no where and hit an ornament case making a loud popping noise. (He was sitting with us, and his only bb gun was broken and in his room.) We were all fairly startled, and immediately after that a box that had been standing in the corner of the room for weeks fell over. I told my dad then that mom was probably not too happy that we're arguing at a time that was very special to her before she died. 

We all calmed down after that and finished decorating the tree. It was interesting to note how after we finished I no longer felt the sense of dread when I went into the living room. I wonder what more that house has, my brother and I often see a dog climbing the stairs out of the corner of our eye. We have a dog, but every time I see the apparition my dog is far away or even right next to me. 

Once at around 2 a.m. I was going to the downstairs bathroom and I swear to god I saw a dogs head peek out of from behind the door. It scared the shit out of me, our dog was upstairs with my brother in his room. One last thing, back when my mom was alive she told me how one day she was alone in the house, reading a book in the living room she heard an audible cough, right next to her. Interestingly, over winter break I heard a loud cough right next to me, and I was completely alone in the house. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f8ytt/activity_in_the_house/
57,Large black figure in doorway,1295992843,"My mum told me a few years back about one night when she had gone to bed and woke up a couple of hours later suddenly, she said she looked at her bedroom doorway and stood there was an outline of a huge figure that took up most of the door frame, she said it had deep red eyes with no pupils.

She told me she was utterly paralysed with fear and after a few seconds screwed her eyes shut and when she opened them the figure was gone.

58,The killing game,1295983551,"When I was a teenager, my best and only friend was Rob. Naturally, both being nerds, we had all these little secret rituals and weird ideas. One of these rituals was the killing game. The rule was simple. You would stare at the other person and you would announce what you would kill him with. The other then had to think of a more spectacular way - or he would lose, i.e., be ""killed"". For example, we would play for the last glass of our favourite OJ and I would stare at him, saying ""I kill you with a laser cannon!"" He would stare back ""I kill you with my photon torpedo!"" and so on.

One day we had watched a particularly corny X-Files episode where someone was manipulating others with his telekinetic powers (again). I stared at Rob and announced ""I kill you with my mind!"". Rob didn't stare back. Instead, he turned quite pale and looked sick. I asked him whether there's anything wrong. He said that he doesn't feel very well and went home shortly after.

The next day he wasn't at school. To say that I felt awful would be an understatement. I was feeling worried, anxious, guilty and sick, all at the same time. When I returned home, my parents sat me down. I already started sobbing when they started with ""We're so sorry.""  The doctors didn't have an explanation, but he had died of a cardiac arrest.

I was frantic. Nothing could solace me or take away my feeling of shame, guilt and sorrow. I had killed the one person I cared about and who had cared about me. I was a murderer and nobody would know it. I had murdered my best friend thanks to a silly game!

With every hour it felt worse and during the funeral I was at the point where it felt as if I was suffocating, as if a thousand needles pierced me and reminded me of my guilt. I was glad when we drove home, but still the sensations increased and made me silently beg for mercy although I knew that I didn't deserve it.

I went to my room and closed the door, breathing as deeply as I could, which wasn't much in this condition. I looked around and found the picture of me and Rob my mother once took. I looked at the image and I understood. I sank to the floor and cried again, this time tears of despair.

On the picture was written: ""I kill you with my soul!""",nosleep,Jabberwockey,/r/nosleep/comments/f8vcv/the_killing_game/
59,Not Afraid of the Dark Anymore,1295976109,"   This event occured about a year and a half ago. I was downstairs (by myself) playing video games until about 4 in the morning. As I was making sure the house was locked up, I noticed a light was on in the kitchen. I made my way into the kitchen and turned off the light.

Then all hell broke loose.

   As I stood in the kitchen, **every** single electronic device in my downstairs area sprang to life. The clock on my oven was flashing, my microwave had turned itself on and was set for 99 minutes and 59 seconds, Tvs had been turned on to random channels, lights were flickering and dimming, and my surround sound stereo system was screaming garbled nonsense. I stood frozen in the kitchen, paralyzed with fear.

   Filled with adrenaline and fright, I managed to work up enough courage to move. I flew up my staircase, skipping 3-4 steps at a time, and ran straight into my parents' bedroom. I was frantic and out of breath, and could only point downstairs with a look of shock on my face. I will never forget what I witnessed as my parents and I peered over the banister: **NOTHING**. No lights were on, no tvs playing, no chaotic jibberish emanating from the stereo's speakers; it was as if nothing had happened at all.

   I will never forget that night. To this day I will not stay downstairs by myself past 2:00 without a flashlight. You always hear of the cliche fear of the darkness, but now I'm afraid of the light...",nosleep,exsavior296,/r/nosleep/comments/f8sjd/not_afraid_of_the_dark_anymore/

64,3:00 AM,1295951033,"My second college summer vacation was last year, and my then-girlfriend (I’ll call her “Megan”) took some summer classes at a cheap college a few hours away. Because her aunt and uncle lived close to the college, Megan went to live with their family for the summer with the understanding that she would house-sit for them when they went on a vacation.

Over the first few weeks, I talked with her over the phone and heard strange details about the house. As a part of their home security system, motion detectors were set up inside the house. Weirdly enough, the motion detectors would go off even when no one was around, and the sensors were replaced multiple times with the same result. It was a 3-level house, though Megan noticed that the family only used the first two floors. Whenever she asked her aunt what was on the third floor, she replied with a curt “We don’t go up there”, and refused to elaborate further. 

Possibly the strangest thing was her reoccurring insomnia. She told me that she woke up every night at 3:00 AM, though she refused to tell me how or why. She mentioned her nightly awakening to her uncle, and he told her that everyone who sleeps in the house wakes up around 3:00, and for her to “not worry about it.” Apparently, this had been going on for years, and everyone from priests to mediums had worked in the house to no avail. While the family was not religious, crucifixes were hung on nearly every wall, which “helped quite a bit”, according to Megan’s aunt. 

Megan was pretty freaked out by her new living conditions, but I reassured her that the motion detectors were faulty electronics, the nighttime awakening was due to some neighbor’s alarm clock, and even joked that the third floor was an off-limits sex dungeon for her aunt and uncle. She appreciated the reassurance, but was annoyed by my skepticism.

Eventually, her uncle left with his family for their vacation, leaving Megan home alone. She begged me to drive over and keep her company the first night she was alone. While spending the night in a creepy house didn’t thrill my soul, I was happy for an excuse to come see her. 

We spent the afternoon taking walks, talking, and enjoying a soak in the family’s hot tub. The house didn’t seem creepy during the day, but that soon changed when the sun went down. I felt a sense of dread as I walked through the house, and I found myself peeking out of windows, annoyed by the feeling that we were somehow being watched. We watched a movie to get our minds off of things (Eastern Promises, btw) before getting ready for bed.

Normally, I would have slept on the couch while she took a bed, but Megan wanted me to be there when she woke up. I assured her that she would sleep through the night, but I decided to sleep on the floor next to her bed anyway. Something wasn't right about that house, and sleeping in the same room now seemed preferable to me too. 

While we were both Christians, we never really talked about our faith with each other. At Megan's request, it was the first night we prayed together. It's hard to explain, and I might get a little flak for this, but I normally feel a bit of God's presence when I pray. That night, I felt nothing- as if God had removed himself from that house. I took a while to calm myself down enough so I could drift off to sleep.

I woke to a single soft popping sound. In my drowsiness, I thought Megan was snapping her fingers at me, but I then realized what the sound was: it was the sound of joints cracking, like bad knees do after they've been inactive for a few hours. The plush carpet on the floor seemed to muffle slow footsteps, and each footstep was accompanied by a louder popping sound. I opened my eyes and looked towards the bedroom door, but I dared not move my head to get a better view.

At this point, I was sure I was dreaming or hallucinating. A dark, wide, 6-foot-tall, hunched figure was standing halfway between me and the doorway. It was man-sized and man-shaped, but something about it was decidedly non-human. The footsteps and popping had stopped, but in their place was a shallow, high-pitched breathing. I thought that the breathing might have been Megan's, but with my now-heightened hearing, I could hear her softly crying.

I laid there for a few minutes, petrified with fear; trying to convince myself that I was dreaming. It seemed like an eternity before everything stopped- the dark figure and the shallow breathing completely disappeared, and no footsteps or popping marked their sudden absence. Megan was the first to speak. “Are you still with me?” she asked. I answered with a whispered “Yeah”, and she breathed what sounded like a sigh of relief. We had survived the worst. I allowed myself to turn my head and look at the clock radio on a desk. It read “3:03 AM”.




In the morning, I pleaded with her to live somewhere else, though she stubbornly refused. I guess she wanted to prove something to herself, and she survived the rest of the summer without going crazy, so she must be tougher than me. We never figured out what was happening with the motion detectors, why the third floor was off-limits, or what that dark figure was in the middle of the night. To tell you the truth, I don’t want to know.

66,The only thing we have to fear...,1295949204,"I am 18 years old, and can safely say that something evil made contact with me once, and now I feel like it is attempting to come back...


 It all started back when I was 12 years old. I used to have a book called ""Goodnight, Moon"". My parents purchased it for me at a Swap Meet (because my family's nickname for me is Moon) from a family who had lost their house in a fire. I had trouble falling asleep as a kid, and would usually wander around my house until I found someplace nice and cozy to lay down, usually outside of my parents room. One night, my parents decided to read the book to me to calm me down. As the tale of a little boy getting ready for bed slowly lulled me to sleep, there was a sudden gust of wind and all the lights in the neighborhood were extinguished. Naturally, this made me lose my nerve, and I was awake all night. 


For the next couple days I had trouble sleeping, so my parents decided again to read ""Goodnight, Moon"" to me. They had just made it halfway through the book, when what felt like an 18-wheeler slammed into my house. We later found out that an earthquake had hit our little neighborhood, and thought nothing more of the matter, however I started to become a little suspicious of the book. I slept off and on for a couple of days, until I finally decided to try reading the book again myself, only to be interrupted by an aftershock from the earthquake that had occurred a few days prior to that night. I concluded that the book was ""unlucky"" and threw it into my closet, never to be seen again. 


Or so I thought. 


As I grew older, I continued my pattern of wandering the house looking for safe, warm areas to sleep. I was getting a full 8 hours worth of sleep during these episodes, so my parents didn't think too much of it. That was until one night in June. I had been sleeping peacefully, until a deep, raspy, almost inhuman voice whispered in my ear to wake up. I quickly opened my eyes to the sight of pitch black darkness. Then slowly, as my eyes adjusted to the lack of light, a figure seemed to appear out of the shadows, like it was sucking what little light there was from the closet. The figure began to take shape, a hulking, massive creature with no real human features at all. I stared in fear at this beast that appeared right before my eyes, and, as if sensing my fear, opened *its* eyes, which were merely slits of gaping darkness filled with light. I screamed for my parents, who quickly rushed into my room. They searched the entire room for me, and gasped in shock when they threw open the closet door to find me standing in the darkness, eyes wide open, gripping the book in my hands until my knuckles turned red. I immediately broke down into tears, and we threw away the book the very next day. 


It has been 6 years since this incident, and while I live in a new house, I have always been skeptical of closets, and whatever could be hiding inside their dark, seemingly cavernous interiors. My fear came to life last week, on January 15, 2011. A Saturday. On Thursday, the 13th, I woke up to the sound of my cat pawing furiously at my closet door. I yelled at it to stop, and it turned around instantly and stared directly into my eyes. Waking up at 3:00 by your cat isn't exactly the most fun thing to do, so I merely fell back asleep. However, for the next two days I was awakened at exactly 3:00 to my cat pawing ferociously at my closet door. Then, on Saturday, I slept as peacefully as ever, until my mother burst into my room, frantically searching for me. She was screaming at me to get any valuables and get out of the house, for another earthquake was violently shaking the very foundation of our new home, but she immediately fell silent when she checked my closet. Inside the pitch blackness, I stood completely still, staring vacantly at my closet wall, breathing heavily, and clutching ""Goodnight, Moon"" in my hands...",nosleep,exsavior296,/r/nosleep/comments/f8mmg/the_only_thing_we_have_to_fear/
67,I had a physical altercation with a ghost.,1295944128,"Ok... not exactly a fist fight... but I guess some back story is in order now...

I live in the midwest.  My family farm has been passed down through generations and for as long as I can remember people considered it a ""special place""

It has access to forests and bluffs, plains and rivers... when my dad used to plow fields he would frequently overturn arrowheads and spearheads... in fact there was some discussion over whether some of the overgrown ""mounds"" in the woods behind my house had actually been created by the natives.

Oh... and according to what information I could gather... its also located near a crossing of ley lines.

As long as I can remember people talked about strange occurrences on the land... when my grandpa first bought the land... he did it with the caveat that the original owner (a very elderly gentleman) could come back whenever he wanted to look for ""the faerie land"" - apparently... when he was a young man he had been walking on the land during the night... he had found a cave... that was glowing inside... when he approached there was a book on a pedestel and beyond that the cave opened to a wonderous valley... that seemed to be paradise.. he KNEW if he entered he would never find his way back... so he returned home... gathered his belongings... bade farewell to his friends... and returned to the cave... only to find it was no longer there... he was crushed... and literally spent the rest of his life trying to find what he had once lost....  but I digress.

The history of strange paranormal sightings begins with my great grandmother... she had a mobile home... and it sat where my current home resides... this may or may not have any meaning... but I know when I was very young there were several nights where she would call up to my parents house (a couple hundred yards away through the forest) to ask them what they were doing outside... and why they were using blue lights on their flashlights...

Scratch that... there was an occurrence that happened even earlier... when my dad moved here he was forced to live in the old farmhouse the farmer had lived in before he sold the place...  (It too was where my current house is... it was torn down and the pipes for the well water recycled when my great grandmother moved in)

One night... my dad had friends over...  One of the women was sleeping on the couch in the old farmhouse living room... she awoke one night and saw a silhouette of a man leaning down over her looking at her... she thought it was my dad and asked what he wanted... and he just leaned closer... so she turned on the light and there was nothing there...  Just empty space...

Now to my own experiences.

When I moved back to the family farm I decided to put up my own home... the spot where the old farmhouse (and subsequently my great grandmothers) had been.  My son had just been born... and I was living by myself with him at the house when my first experience happened.

I was lying on the couch... and I awoke to just feel something... off... like there was someone else there... you just kind of feel the presence... I looked into the kitchen (the living room was a few steps down and opened up from there... and I saw it... a perfectly shaped male silhouette... im not sure how I knew... I just knew it was male... it looked like a shadow in 3 dimensions.

As I was watching... it slowly moved to the top of the stairway... I remember I felt protective of my son and I stood up facing it... with my son beside me on the couch... and said... in a strong clear voice 

""Go away please""

It paused... cocked its ""head"" and looked at me...

And then it disappeared... I will never be able to explain the how of it happening... it drew back into the dark spots and shadows of the house... it shimmered and dissolved... dispersed... all those things... and yet none... it just ceased to be.

I was scared... but had never felt anything malevolent... so I filed it away and after a couple months... things were back to normal.

Fast forward to a couple years later... my son is sleeping in my bed myself with him... I awake to feel INTRUDED upon... not like before... this presence was unwanted.  Everything that happened next took the span of only a couple seconds... but I remember it perfectly... I awoke... something was wrong... I had left my bedroom door open and I looked into the dark hallway outside (every light in the house was off) and I could see a woman there.  She was not super tall... between 5'2"" and 5""6""  and in the darkness there was only the black shape of her body... her clothes and hair were all the exact same level of blackness... but her face was pale... and stood out in the moonlight.

She was UNWANTED... I remember looking at her and feeling like I needed to protect my son from her attentions.... in fact..... the very fact she was THERE felt like a violation... I wanted her OUT.  

All that leapt through my head faster than I can tell you... under 2 seconds... I don't know where or how I had the energy... but I honestly felt like I used to when I was jacked up for a football game... ready to rumble... and if need be physically make this.... THING leave.

I charged into the hallway, the woman didnt move or blink... nor fade away, just stood there staring at me... and as I approached her my first inclination was to just wrap my arms around her as I rushed forward... almost like a tackle.

I reached her... grabbed through her... and as I touched her I swooned and fell to my knees... like a reflection in a pond she was disrupted as I splashed into her.. and immediately was gone... but I was left reeling.... and what felt a LONG time later (but was probably only approx 2 minutes) I finally was able to get my legs and rest of my body to respond and I walked back into the bedroom to keep watch over my son.

I don't know if it was intentionally negative or not... but I wasn't taking any chances and her staring at us in our sleep felt... WRONG... and totally unwanted... whereas the shadowman I had seen before had seemed merely curious... her intentions had seemed... more up to debate....

I have never had another experience here... but some of my friends who have spent the night have heard someone calling their name... I had a room-mate for a while who kept a tomahawk by him it happened so much... just in case.....

Im a very logical person... and I have tried to write the things that happened as ""waking dreams"" and other things brought on by my mind running while I sleep... but I tell you... I have NEVER felt anything similar to what I felt when I touched the physical form of that woman in the moonlight... it was like being a fully charged battery that instantly was completely discharged...  or hit by a horse tranquilizer in less time than it takes to take a breath.

I know the formatting sucked, but you get it in the same way it leaves my mind.  Hope you enjoyed the story... and I swear its all 100% true.  Though even friends who have never been around to experience any of these things say im full of shit when I try to relate any of these stories.",nosleep,Valdus_Pryme,/r/nosleep/comments/f8lre/i_had_a_physical_altercation_with_a_ghost/

70,My Aunt's house,1295931589,"Whenever I visit San Fransisco I stay at my aunt's house.  She has a pretty normal house in a suburb, the San Carlos area.  From my earliest memories of visiting I've always hated the place.  Granted that the first weird experience I had there was her actually pranking me, or so I think.  

I was five years old and sleeping on the floor of her living room.  There were large sliding glass doors that I wasn't used to which were keeping me up.  All of a sudden this little electric toy dog starts yapping at me.  I usually played with the thing, but it was freaking me out.  I looked around expecting to see someone using the remote control, and realized that the remote was actually visible on the TV stand nearby, unmanned.  The dog eventually stopped and I went back to sleep.  My Aunt claimed she wasn't messing with me and can't explain it either.  

Fast forward a few years and my aunt is now at my house telling me about how she's scared of break ins.  She says that lately she's been hearing thumps in the middle of the night, when she goes to investigate she finds 2 candle holders have fallen off the mantle onto the marble fireplace.  There doesn't appear to be any other sign of disturbance but it freaks her out.  The strange part of this is that the candles survive the 6 foot drop.  

Well I'll admit that I take some kind of sick pleasure in this because I'm convinced she was messin with me all those years ago.  Until this past summer I was in town for a cousin's wedding.  I slept in the room with the fireplace mantle.  First few nights were no problem I slept pretty easily and nothing strange happened.  On the night of the wedding I come back from the reception and go to bed.  Its about 5 am and I wake up in a cold sweat.  I cannot move, literally just can't move a muscle in my body.  It feels like im tied down to the floor, gravity is a million times stronger than it should be.  My eyes won't even open, I'm aware of all this and still can't break it.  All of a sudden there's a vice grip of pain that just grabs me at the ribs and works its way up to my face.  At this point I realize how hard i've been holding my breath.  The gripping pain comes to a climax in my face and I let out a gasp.  It takes me a lot longer than it should for me to scramble to my feet and sprint to the bathroom.  My dad comes out of the next room looking for me.  I hear him walk into the room where I was just sleeping.  As I splash cold water on my face and catch my breath I hear him walking back towards the bathroom.  I come out of the bathroom and he flinches, as if he wasn't expecting to see me.  I barely stutter to him, ""Pops, holy shit I just had an anxiety attack or something, freaked out.""   

""Oh are you okay now?"" He replies slowly, ""I thought you were still sleeping in the other room?"" he questions me.

""No i got up after I felt like i couldnt move"" I tell him.  ""Hmmmm I thought i saw you laying in the sleeping bag still.""  At this point I'm just like okay what the fuck.  This is when my aunt comes over and asks whats wrong.  I'm trying to not seem like a psycho so I brush her off, my dad heads back to bed and she leaves me with a night light in case I have to find the bathroom again.  Well fuck that, I slept with the lights on and didn't even really sleep until dawnish.  As I was leaving the place I felt so relieved, I was just happy to GTFO of there.  After all this happened I pretty much swore off ever staying there again. 

Except, the family is going to visit my grandparents there this Wednesday, as my grandpa is in bad shape.  I really don't want to say ""Hey family let's spend money on a hotel because I'm a pussy""  FUCKING GREAT

71,A story my mom used to tell before she passed away...,1295927156,"My mother used to tell me this story years ago. When she was young, the kids in her neighborhood would get together to go explore the abandoned buildings in the warehouse district because, well, I guess fun had yet to be invented. One night, the gang was on its way to explore a favorite old building, when out of nowhere a storm kicked up. Thunder, lightning, the works. They all quickly rushed inside just as the rain starts to pour, and shut the door. Flipping on their flashlights, they find that its not the building they meant to go into, but a different one, an old meat packing plant, long ago forgotten.

Eagerly, the young explorers move through the building, flashlights casting beams in the dust kicked up from their feet. Walking up a catwalk, they come to a room. Inside is scrawled along the walls the number '1'. This is kind of a gang heavy area, so no one thinks anything of it. They go to the next room, and the number '2', is written everywhere in black paint. '3'...'4'...'5'...'6'...all the same, except for the seventh room.

In the seventh room, other than the normal rust one would expect to find on metal walls, there is nothing, save for a single playing card; the seven of clubs. An argument broke out over who was to enter the room. No one wanted to go. Finally, they picked the youngest kid (the easiest to pressure into going). He takes a few steps into the room. The window blows open, water from the storm outside comes pouring in, before slamming shut again. The young kid almost bolts, but the others convince him to keep going. The water starts to pour down the walls, turning a weird red color, collecting in pools on the floor, growing closer with each step the kid takes. Finally, he reaches the card, all flashlights trained on him. He slowly reaches down, picking it up, and that's when every one hears a voice, almost as if right next to their ear hissing, ""The seven of Clubs!"" The door slammed shut. Hysterical screams from the boy trapped inside, clawing to get out. Everyone tries to get the door open, but it doesn't budge, then there is silence on the other side of the door. A final scream. Everyone runs. My mom says she turned back on last time, and saw the seven of clubs slide under the door. She rushed back, grabbed it, then was outside with everyone else.

For the longest time, I passed this off as a story, something to tell the kids for whatever reason suited the parents at the time. After she passed away we were going through some of her stuff to give to the goodwill, and that's when I saw it, packed away at the [bottom of a long forgotten and beaten up trunk.](http://i.imgur.com/8tubG.jpg)

72,Dark Interstate,1295923381,"It was going to be the happiest day of her life, and it was, for a while. Now, it was going to be the happiest night of mine.

It was a lonely, cold, starlit night. The highway was silent and almost pitch black, with only my car and its dim headlights hurtling down the asphalt at seventy miles per hour.  Black trees stood ghost-like on the horizon, a mix of conifers and broad-leaved oaks. A crescent of a moon barely winked at us from high overhead.  There were no radio stations or cell phone signals out here, but I had neglected to turn off the stereo, so a low-pitched squealing static quietly hissed against the background of wind and tire noise.

We were driving to our honeymoon. I had all the items we needed pack tightly in the small trunk of my sedan. Let’s see, there was a suitcase, some heavy duty rope, a shovel, and large plastic trash bags. Perfect!

Finally I reached the mile marker I was looking for. Here was our destination. I pulled over to the shoulder of the road, the tires crunching loudly in the silence of the night over the crushed gravel. From there, I killed the lights and the engine, and unlocked the doors. It was time for her to get out with me and enjoy our time together. There was not another soul for miles, as it felt like were the only people on the entire world.

I got out of the car and opened the back door. There lay my precious bride, her eyes brimming with tears from happiness at our union. She squirmed and squealed with excitement. She wasn’t able to move much—I had seen to that. I popped the trunk and reached for the carefully selected lengths of rope I had acquired.  I threw my blushing bride in her blood-stained, torn white dress to the ground and grinned. With the rope I bound her ankles and wrists, and stuffed her mouth with enough cotton to make a king sized sheet. I picked her up, despite her squirming, and grabbed the shovel from the trunk and descended into the woods just a few yards from the shoulder.

It was even darker in the woods. I had forgotten to bring a flashlight. Silly me. Oh well, there was just enough light from the moon to see our honeymoon suite deep in a grove of trees.  My eyes glinted with anticipation.

My lovely bride was laying in the dirt and grass next to the circle of tall, whispering pines where we would find our final destination. I lifted the shovel and struck the soft earth with it, beginning the grave. Each shovel struck the earth like a death knell, making our final home bigger. She struggled so cutely against the ropes—but I was an expert knot tier. She wasn’t going anywhere.

My shovel struck something hard about three feet down. I squatted down to see what it was. Slowly I pulled it out of the soft earth—a skull? How cliché, I thought, and tossed it aside.

I felt something tap me on the shoulder. For an instant I figured my bride had gotten out of her bonds, but I looked around long enough to see the skull I had tossed floating behind me at eye-level, with a faint violet glow coming from the blackness of its eye sockets. Startled, I stepped back and fell into the grave I had dug. The shovel lifted into the air as though the skull was holding it, and in one swift stroke brought it down on my neck like a guillotine, slicing my head from my body. In my last instants, I saw my own bloody stump of a neck fall away from my head into the grave, and my view rolled around on the ground. As my vision blurred and darkened, I saw my frightened bride suddenly slip from her bonds and run shrieking back towards the highway. The skull dropped to the ground right in front of me, grinning and staring back into my own dying eyes. As darkness enveloped me, I heard the dirt being shuffled back onto the body I had dropped into the self-made grave, and a distant motor starting. Then there was nothing.

73,One last visit,1295919394,"This occured during the summer of 2007. I was 15 years old at the time

I stayed up very late one summer night watching tv and eventually fell asleep on the couch in my living room, I obviously had no blankets or anything since I wasn't planning on sleeping on the couch and I left the TV on.

I remember I dreamt about the neighborhood I lived in from the age of 1 - 7, I always loved that place and had many fond memories like my grandma taking me on walks everyday to the park, or walking me to school. Anyways I woke up at around 5 am to the sound of a thump in a cold sweat and completely out of energy. I didn't really acknowledge the thump I heard till later, probably because I didn't really know that's what woke me up and I was more concerned with how I was feeling. When I say I woke up in a cold sweat, I mean I was absolutely soaked in sweat.

But I really didn't think anything of it. So I got out from under my covers and headed upstairs and down the hallway to my bedroom to go back to sleep. While walking through the hallway I noticed that one of the pictures had fallen off the wall, this is where I remembered hearing a thump. It was a picture of my grandma who lives out of town now but still visits us as much as she can. The picture wasn't broken or anything so I just stuck it back up on the wall and went on my way to the bedroom.

This time I sleep normally. I wake up at around 11 am and on my way downstairs I notice the same picture from before was back on the ground, so I put it up yet again. Must have not put it on very well the first time I thought.

So I get downstairs where my mom and dad are watching tv, I notice blankets on the couch and that made me remember having blankets when I woke up on the couch earlier and I thought that was kind of weird since I didn't go to sleep with any. But hey one of my family members must have seen me sleeping and put covers on me.

This is when my mom mentions that my grandma passed away earlier in the morning. I remember all of the sort of weird stuff that went on when I woke up at 5 am on the couch, and thought jokingly ohhhh it must have been her trying to communicate some how! Without really believing it, but I decided to ask if they knew what time exactly that she passed away, because I was curious. My mom replied, They believe it was sometime around 5 in the morning.

At this point I was a little spooked out, but it was still more jokingly in my mind, just me trying to spook myself out. I ate my breakfast, the mood in the house was kind of somber but generally normal. After breakfast I head back up stairs and I see it. The picture of her on the ground again, this time the frame was all smashed up.

That scared the hell out of me. Only for a brief couple of seconds though. I realized I had nothing to fear, she loves us with all her heart and we love her too. If this was anything it was just her wanting to say goodbye and see us again. On the other hand, It could just be nothing. But I like to believe its the former.

75,A dream that occurred during my childhood and reoccurred a few years later,1295906023,"So I remember this old nightmare that I had a long time ago when I was a kid and when I used to live in Mexico. I was dreaming that i was at a friend's house, playing Nintendo 64 when I realized that the day was getting dark. Not wanting to get in trouble by my mother, I made my way out of my friend's house and walked back home(we both lived in the same street).

I noticed that the entire street was extremely quiet and foreboding. There was nothing or nobody talking and this is a Mexican neighborhood, there's always some form of activity going on. I was a little confused, but payed no attention as I went home, when things got weirder.

Now mind you, for some weird reason, I was dreaming in complete black and white. I noticed that my house's front door was open, and so was the back door and in the backyard, all my family was standing and looking straight up. I walked curiously to them and asked them cheerfully, ""what's going on?""

""Look up,"" they said.

I looked up. Nothing important just a dreary, cloudy day. It wasn't long before I heard this tremendous rumbling and saw these...things passing us, hundred of feet long and wide and all flying at different heights. I was shocked by it but I felt like I could have shit my pants when I started to see a very large....thing, SCREECHING above us. It didn't seem like it was very far up from us but the sound was just this constant screeching. I couldnt make much out of it as it passed above us.

And that's when I woke up. It was night, everything was ok and the moon was shining. What didn't help was that an airplane was serenely floating through the sky. Nearly shat my pants and covered myself head to toe in blankets.

The dream actually continued, albeit a few years later. The dream was still black and white and I was curious as to what was happening. Friends of mine were going nuts as they heard news that something dropped from the sky. Curiousity got the best of me and we headed down the street to a large soccer park. Everyone who was everyone came to the park to see what was going on and by the time I got there, a medium congregation of people were there.

""It's so cool!""

""Look at it!""

""Wow!""

""Amazing!""

was but one of the many tid-bits of conversation I heard as I walked towards it. Smoke was billowing out of it and I pushed away people to see. As I got closer and closer, I felt...scared and my  mind raced and wanted to know, what's in there. As I pushed away the last person, I was ready to see this thing when...

I woke up in a cold sweat, looking at the ceiling with a bewildered look in my eyes. I pussied out, I was too scared to want to know.

76,I think I was haunted by a demon,1295904278,"Or a really pissed off ghost.

The story starts when I was incredibly young.  I lived out near the ocean in California and of course swam in the water, body surfed, boogie boarded, all the stuff kids do.  One time I was boogie boarding and smashed into a hidden rock and got carried underwater by a current.  I'm fairly certain I was dead for a couple seconds since I saw a bunch of hands, my body, a weird light.. all that Near Death Experience stuff.

Since then I've seen people that I'm fairly certain aren't really there.  Either nobody else will notice them or there will be a sort of funny feeling around them.  Sometimes they'll even be wearing old clothes or just be a shadow.  All my life I chalked this up to some weird brain damage that I might have gotten from hitting my head so hard and never told anybody because I'm TERRIFIED of being mentally ill.  (irrational fears, wtg)

But when I was in high school I started to see things in my own home, which had never happened before.  We had just moved into a new house that was previously owned by some terrible meth heads.  Some bad shit went down, cops were called, there was a shootout and all sorts of terrible, horrible, unsolved murder things were found in there.  But it was all cleaned up to be a pretty swanky house and the rent was half off so my mom figured as long as she never told us kids what went down, there was no reason to not move in.

I was sitting at home alone one morning (I usually decided school was BS and didn't go) when I heard a thumping up the basement stairs.  I assumed it was my mom (who took the biggest room down there) late for work.  I leaned over to wait for her to come around the corner into the living room where I was, but I didn't see her.  I figured she forgot something and went back down, and returned to my cereal.

About half an hour later I'd forgotten the whole thing, but suddenly heard the thumping again, just like someone running up the stairs.  Again, no mom and I was starting to get chills.  I get up and go to the top of the stairs to see what's up and there I see it.  Standing at the bottom of the stairs was this black humanoid, really fuzzy around the edges and steaming like he was made of smoke.  I ran out of the house and stayed with some friends for the day.

Nothing happened for a week or so.  But just when I was starting to assume I was overreacting to a shadow, it started again.  Thumping up the stairs, then down the stairs, then up, then down.  It was louder than it was before and happened about once every ten minutes.  I didn't leave the house, choosing to ignore it like I do most of the crazy shit I see or hear.  It went on all day and stopped about an hour before my mom or sister got home.

That night I went to bed and heard something thumping on the back of my closet wall.  On the other side of that wall was the kid's bathroom, so I figured maybe my sister was trying to figure out the toilet and was super tired.  After a couple minutes I went out to check on her... of course the bathroom was empty.  But I could still hear the thumping and the towels were moving like something was brushing against them with every thump.  Again I left the house and went to the only place in town that was open that late- a tattoo parlor.  I wanted a reason to not go back for a couple hours, so I got a tattoo  (probably the worst reason to get one, waste of money)

This started to happen every night.  The thumping up and down the stairs quit but now I'd hear it in my closet, on my closed bedroom door and on the window.  My sister even came in a couple times and asked me what I was doing and wouldn't believe me when I told her that I was just sitting there and it wasn't me making that noise.  Though it was a little comforting that someone else could hear it, I was freaked to shit that it was definitely not her rigging up some terrible prank.

About a month after all this had started, I woke up to someone saying my name.  Then I felt the end of my bed dip, like someone had sat there.  I even saw a dent in the blankets.  I was frozen in fear and couldn't move until I felt something touch my leg and sloooowly move up it.  At that point I bolted and went to sit in the living room with some TV on.  I couldn't exactly leave the house (where would I go?) but I figured late night cartoons might calm me down.

When I woke up on the couch the next morning, my arms were covered in blood.  I washed it off and found scratches in my arms, really thin but deep like maybe a knife cut.

This happened every.  Single.  Night.  I would go to bed terrified, sometimes wake up in the middle of the night to thumping, touches or weird feelings and wake up in the morning with some new scratch on my body.  I had to cover up and everybody thought I was cutting myself.  My colorguard coach even sent me to talk to the school shrink because she thought I was doing it and nobody would believe me that I wasn't.

The weirdest scratch that I had was a giant S on the back of my right hand.  There was a vertical line going from the bottom of the S all the way down the back of my arm to my elbow and little horizontal lines cutting across it.

This happened for four months before my mom finally believed me.  She told me she'd been hearing weird noises and seeing someone crouched outside her window, looking in.  And sometimes there'd be a shadow standing at the door, watching her.  She did some research (being more level headed than me) and found something about a house's spirit (called a Deva I think) that can take on the attitude and motive of the people who live there.  She said that because of how horrible it was there before we'd moved in, the spirit had grown accustomed to living off of fear and anger.  Since it wasn't getting that from us, it tried to create those feelings.

So we talked to a couple of new agey people and they outlined some exorcisms that we could try.  We did one and it stopped for a while, going back to just noises and the occasional shadow.  So we tried giving offerings to it, having a little shrine in the boiler room where we'd leave things that the internet told us house spirits liked.  As stupid as that might sound, it got everything to stop altogether.

Since then I've never experienced anything like that again.  I would see the occasional shadow in the house, but it wasn't any more vivid or intense than any other weird shadow I saw out in public.  We've since moved out of the house and I still leave stuff once a month for my house's spirit.  Just in case it happens again.
.

.

TL;DR, I started seeing/hearing weird shit in the house, started to wake up with cuts and bruises all over and eventually my mom found someone to do an exorcism.  Ghostie thingy might have been a house spirit.

77,"Glass ""fingers"" running through my window blinds when I was a kid",1295903865,"I've been a long time fan of this subreddit and I read a story that seemed similar to one of my experiences as a kid.  Of course, everything is true, even if it's not, but I remember this vividly and tried to explain it for years while I lived at that house.

I had metal window blinds in my room when I was younger (I want to say I was about 9 or 10 years old) and I would either be sleeping or playing in my room and I would hear the blinds move.  It always sounded like a breeze would come in the open window and move the blinds against the frame. It also always happened later in the day when I was getting ready for bed.  

As I got older, my critical thinking improved a bit I guess, so I tried to debunk the blinds by checking to see if the window was closed.  My bed was opposite the window so I had a good perspective on the blinds and I was also on the top floor with absolutely no balcony or overhang for someone to stand on outside. My plan was to click on the light when I heard the swooshing sound. One night (it was during the Colorado winter so my window was not open), I waited for the sound to happen again and I quickly turned on the light.  What I saw still sticks with me.  Poking through my window blinds was what looked like a bunch of glass ""fingers.""  They weren't shaped like human fingers but more like broken pieces of glass arranged in the same manner a human hand would be.  The glass shards slid into my room and then quickly back out.  When they slid out, the sound of blinds swooshing happened again - the same sound I have been hearing for years.  They moved as if anyone's hand would opening a window from the bottom to slide it up.  

After that, I moved downstairs into another bedroom. I never heard the blind sounds down there and the room I was previously in served as an office until we moved out a couple years later.  I asked my parents about the glass fingers and they thought I was crazy, but they did say the house was older and had some ""history.""  They weren't specific as to what ""history"" that was, though.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f8ax7/glass_fingers_running_through_my_window_blinds/

80,Woke up cold,1295900959,"So I've been sitting at work reading these posts and thought I'd share mine.

It was a while ago, maybe a year or 2. I was sleeping in my room at my parents house and I woke up absolutely freezing. Well, my blanket had fallen off so that makes sense right. I rolled over to grab it and glanced at the clock, it was a couple minutes past 3 a.m. As I grabbed my blanket I felt the need to look over my shoulder towards the end of my bed. What I think I saw made let out a ""What the fuck?!?"" I then quickly curled up tight under my blanket. 

I could swear I saw this tall...person like thing. It had lonnnng black hair that looked kind of wet, it had a grey swollen face with just black eyes, well not even eyes, more like eye sockets i guess.

While under my blanket thinking what the hell did I just see and did I really see that I got incredibly hot, and started to sweat. Afraid to uncover or even peek out, I just let one arm out from under the covers. I got a slow chill up my arm which freaked me out even more so I went back to hiding fully covered until I fell back asleep. 

I told my mom this and she just shrugged it off as just still being half asleep. That could be true but it still scared the shit out of me. 
 
That's the only thing that's happened to me in my house. My little sister on the other hand told me something once that was just as weird. From her bed she could see out into the hallway and she said that sometimes she'd see an all black figure pacing back and forth. When it got outside her door it would stop and look, then continue. That coming from a little kid (probably between 6 &amp; 7 at the time) is so spooky. And now that I'm thinking about it I find it rather horrifying because she passed away 4 years ago this May.

It was many weeks before I remembered where the dream began and the memory ended. I was eight and I was easily frightened. I began to have a recurring dream. I would awake in my bunk bed, wet from sweat and fouled by the stench of what was kept beneath my skin.
I dreamt myself in my hallway, breathing heavily with not a sound. My chest heaved and fell, my tongue wagged and the air hung heavy with sweet. 
I awoke reluctantly.
I began to notice lesions on my skin and did nothing. I was eight. 
The dream became more vivid and I would lose sleep to the howls of creatures outside of my home. 
I would dream myself outside and those howls would become sweet victims of some thing with sharp teeth that grinned at it's prey. 
The dream and the screams would leave me weeping and I knew there was something more. I was only eight. 
I remember the beginning of dream. I was inside and I felt relief. I was alive indoors where I needed to be. Nothing outdoors could hurt me. I was safe. I walked the length of my hallway and returned to my room. My brother sleeping was now replaced with a down pillow and I dove into the salt and iron human sensations and I drank my rest. 
I awoke to the iron taste on my teeth. My hallway echoed shuffles as the door to my room flung open. The teeth were here and my mother howled but I lay still for I knew my role.

84,I wonder if its sitting there now... waiting for me...,1295864936,"About 3 weeks ago I took home a chair that's been moving around the neighborhood a lot over the past year. I live in a fairly small neighborhood with big houses packed together, and the only road leading out of the neighborhood is a small, single lane road thats a mile down the hill, so nobody really bothers to take it down the road for the trash trucks to pick it up along with the trash. Every other week its outside in front of somebody's house cause they are getting rid of it. Sure enough another neighbor will go get it, seeing that its a perfectly good chair. Its a little scuffed up from constantly getting thrown outside and left there till somebody picks it up. Heres a picture of the [chair](http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u211/sabersar2/710d8b27.jpg) after I cleaned it up. I took it because it was sitting outside of my next door neighbors house for about 2 weeks and nobody was bothering to get it. It was supposed to rain the next couple of days so I didn't want this already sun beaten chair to get ruined anymore than it was. Now, this chair is incredibly comfortable. I loved it! But the past few weeks since i've had it, i've been noticing something strange... something disturbing...

Around the time I brought the chair in my house, strange things started happening. At night, strange things happen in my room while I sleep. The first week I had the chair, I kept having extremely vivid dreams. Dreams where I would try to run from something. I didn't know what I was even running from, but as fast as I tried to run I just kept getting slower and I'd hear the ticking of a clock get louder and slower as what ever it was that was chasing me got me, then I'd wake up. Then sometimes I wake up to something falling off my shelf that sits right next to my bed. But this last week things have been getting worse. Tuesday morning, around 2:30am, I woke up to the squeaking noise the chair makes when you lean back and forth in it. But when I turned my light on the chair was completely still. No signs of movement. It was pushed in the chair space in my desk just as it was before I went to sleep. Wednesday morning around the same time, I woke up to the same thing. At this point I was fairly paranoid so I turned my light on, flipped on the TV and sat in my bed till I feel asleep. Nothing happened thursday night. Friday night was a different story... I woke up again around the same time to the same squeaking noise. This time I looked at my clock and remembered the time. It was 2:32am. This time though the site I saw left me crippled with fear, nausea, and a painful knot in my stomach. As I looked up through the darkness, my eyes slowly adjusting to the dark, I did not see my chair sitting under the space in my desk. I was slightly confused so I reached for the switch on the lamp. When I turned on the light, I found the chair sitting at the foot of my bed, facing towards me. Instantly I let out a cries of ""holy shit!"" and ""what the fuck!"" and within seconds my parents came rushing into my room and asked me what was going on.

I pointed to the chair but all they did was stair in confusion. So I told them that the chair had been under the desk when I went to sleep. But they convinced me that I just forgot it was sitting out. They didn't however give me an answer as to why it was directly facing me. But Saturday night was the absolute worst. I had a dream that was all black. I don't remember an actual dream. All I remember was this loud, horrible squeaking, almost a screeching sound that woke me up. I was sweating but cold. My room was freezing. But then I remembered what happened Friday night and instantly I began to feel the fear fill entire body spreading from my chest, outwards. I was too terrified to open my eyes and look around the room. Something was different about the atmosphere in my room this time. It was more tense. Very stressful. Almost hateful.

 I finally brought myself to slowly open my eyes, fear still pulsing through my body. I let my eyes slowly adjust to the darkness. And with all the courage in my body, I forced myself to look around the room. It was so unnaturally dark in my room this night, it wasn't normal. I started from my door working my way around the room. The idea of the chair once again being somewhere it's not supposed to be was causing my mind and body to express every symptom of stress and anxiety at the fullest. And there at the foot of my bed, was the chair. This time thought, there was a dark human figure in the chair. A dark shadow. I panicked and reached for the light. As soon as it was on, I looked back to where the chair was. It wasn't at my bed anymore. It was at my desk the way I had it before I went to sleep. I'm not sure if the stress from the previous night had caused a hallucination or maybe just the pure darkness in my room caused my mind to play a terrible trick on me. I'm sleeping downstairs tonight but I don't think I'll be sleeping very well. Fear still grips me.

Tomorrow I'm taking that fucking chair down to the end of the road and ripping it apart. I want it to sit in pieces by our trash cans.

I talked to the neighbors and told them strange things have been happening with the chair. I didn't describe my entire story to them cause I thought it may cause them to think I'm crazy. But they all said strange things happened in their house too while the chair was in their possession. I asked who first owned it and I was led to an old widow that lives about a block down the neighborhood. She said it belonged to her husband before he died about 2 years ago. She told me he always sat in the chair in his office in their house. He would stay up late at night just sitting and smoking his tobacco pipe and rocking back and forth on the chair. One morning he never came to bed though. She told me she found him dead in his chair in the office in the morning. She said after he died she thought she could hear his chair squeaking downstairs in his office at night. She was disturbed by this and put the chair outside for somebody to take or throw away.

All I can hear in my head right now is the screeching in my dream. I keep playing it over and over again in my mind...



**The chair is gone. It's 4:28pm. I was leaving the neighborhood to go to the market and I noticed the chair wasn't there anymore. Trash doesn't come till tomorrow morning so I think somebody took it. Well it's their problem now. God help them.**

There needs to be some context to my experience, so quickly.. I was raised catholic (Even though I don't consider myself catholic anymore) and for confirmation, I got a gift, it was a glass bible... It's not a fancy term for something else, it's literally a bible in the form of glass and it's just for decorations. And after a few years with this object being in my room on my desk, something strange happened one night.

So I fell asleep, nothing interesting, but around 12:00am I hear a rattling noise... Almost like if you got a glass bowl, tipped it on the side, and let it go hearing it bounce from one end of the bowl to the other continually until it stops as it balances. Of course, not being the superstitious type of person, thought nothing of it. A few minutes later, the noise happens again, and now it made me think and the only thing I could associate it with is an animal crawling between the dry wall of my house... It once again stopped and started again, and this time it was louder, and this time, I could also pinpoint where it was. On my desk. So I turned on the light and tried to find this rattling noise... I kept shaking objects on my desk until I could replicate the noise, and ends up that it was that glass bible of mine. 

Now, why I found it a bigger deal than it sounds is the fact that I shook the desk, and doesn't matter how slightly I shook the desk, that rattling of the glass bible would always be accompanied by all the other objects on my desk rattling. The fact that this noise was produced on its own and also increasingly got louder every start and stop was really eerie. In the end, I had to put the object away in a storage box. And I am sure it was that bible, the rattling noise had a unique sound that was easily identifiable with some voluntary shaking.",nosleep,TastyBiscuit,/r/nosleep/comments/f7y7m/i_cant_explain_a_rattling_noise_i_had_to_move_it/

I wake up on a metal table in a morgue.  The lights are flickering on and off above me and no one is in sight.  I walk up to the drawers in the morgue and see that they have names of my closest friends and family members on them.  Reluctantly, I open each drawer.  There's what appears to be a body of the specific person covered by a white cloth, but when I pull it off, there's nothing underneath.  One by one I go through all of the drawers to see that no one is there.  Finally, I come to the last drawer in the morgue.  It has my name on it.  I reach for the handle and pull slowly to see that there's another white cloth with what appears to be my body under it.  The only difference is, when I pull the cloth off,  my lifeless corpse IS under it.

94,Thirsty,1295849882,"My story starts one year ago


January 25th, 2010. I remember the date because it is both my anniversary with my girlfriend (2 years) and my mothers birthday. I had my own apartment in North Carolina, three bedroom that i shared with only one roommate, and had just got back from a month of visiting my parents in Florida. I was taking a sememster off from college so i took my time getting back to NC. When i finally rolled in at about 3 AM, i chose to crash at my place, I was already almost falling asleep at the wheel from the twelve hour drive and my gf's place was another twenty minutes. Unlocked the front door and dropped my shit by the coffee table. 

Tired as I was, I wondered if my roommate was in and glanced around for some sign. He had gone to stay with his grandmother over Christmas break, and for the most part I never saw the guy. He was messy as shit and didn't have any kitchenware of his own so he frequently used mine, not that it would have mattered if he could just learn to pick up after himself. I was not surprised to find a half full glass of ice water on the coffee table without a coaster. I sighed and shook my head, remembering the last conversation that we had where i politely asked him to remember to use a coaster otherwise it leaves rings on my coffee table. I picked it up and poured it out in the sink, unlocked the door to my bedroom and threw myself down on the bed.

A few months later, I opted out of my lease and moved in with my grilfriend. I hadn't seen my roommate since before Christmas, and found out that he had dropped out of school over the break and moved out back in December. I was a little pissed off because he had ""borrowed"" my nicest sweatshirt without permission, and I knew there was no way I was getting it back.  After I realized he stole it, I started locking the door to my bedroom (I had never really been one to lock doors, my old neighborhood was way out in the woods and was one where you left your house unlocked and keys in your car's ignition overnight without a second thought) I thought nothing of it until tonight.

This weekend, my girlfriend is at her parents place visiting them and her sister. They live 3 hours away, so I have had the place to myself. This evening I realized i needed more food in our apartment, so i made a quick trip to the store to pick up some frozen pizzas. When I got back, I unlocked the door and tossed the pizza in the oven and sat on the couch. Thats when i noticed the glass of water on the coffee table. I knew it wasnt mine because I don't drink water if I can help it. I panicked for a second wondering how the hell it got there, then realized that my girlfriend must have put it there. I breathed a sigh of relief, and put it on a coaster and turned on the football game. The oven alarm went off at the same time the phone rang. I answered the phone while I took the pizza out of the oven. It was my girlfriend, letting me know that she was on her way home from her parents' house. We chatted for a bit and I hung up so i could eat my pizza. I put my plate down on the coffee table, and thats when it hit me.

She couldn't have put it there, she hasn't been home all weekend. I picked up the glass. It was still cold, and there was ice in it. Only my girlfriend and I have keys to this apartment. Then I remembered about my roommate. I had never thought about it, but there is no way that that water could have been his, he had turned in his keys more than three weeks earlier.
My girlfriend and I have just checked all the windows, and they are all locked. I'm going to the main office in the morning to find out if maintenince let themselves in, though i dont understand why they would. 

Im sitting on the couch now.
All the lights in the apartment are on.
I can't sleep.

96,County Highway X,1295845353,"There’s a road about an hour from where I live that has a rather dark reputation. Strangely enough it’s called County Highway X. It’s a two lane country road that is barely two lanes wide with an unpainted center line. The nearly ancient, gray and cracked asphalt barely rises from the surrounding dank landscape, and it’s nearly twenty miles long in this place alone. There are no roads going off it, just some gravel and dirt driveways to old, sometimes abandoned houses.

The landscape itself is a swampy muck, with water and mud brimming right up next to the non-existent shoulder of the road. Skeletal trees that haven’t seen leaves in decades crane upward from the brown earth, and long grasses, also dead, wave forebodingly in any breeze that happens across this place. In winter, the road is sometimes closed because of excessive ice and snow, and hardly ever gets plowed or even salted.

From what I had heard, even on sunny, bright days, the road had a desolate feel to it, and was unusually quiet, and the air was chilled, even in summer. On cloudy days it was positively creepy, and at night, it was downright terrifying.

No one was really sure what had happened there. Some people said an Indian burial ground was nearby. Others said witchcraft and Satanism had been practiced in the area, and others said a maniac father killed his entire family in one of the dead houses that happened along the road. Another story was a drunk driver had hit a jogger, and both of them got sucked down into the black swamp, never to be seen again.

Once you got your driver’s license, it was a rite of passage to drive a bunch of your friends up to Highway X late at night, and drive the entire length of it without turning around. It wasn’t like you could turn around, anyway, on that narrow sunken road, unless you were lucky enough to spot one of the unmaintained driveways that you rarely passed.

Anyway, I had just gotten my driver’s license that spring, and so my friends were bugging me to take them up there. Finally, a weekend came that my parents were out of town, and so around 10 PM three of my friends showed up at my house, and we took off into the night towards the highway. One of my friends kept a lookout for cops, because at my age we weren’t supposed to have that many people in my car.

About an hour later, we came to the entrance to County X. A stop sign that was so faded the letters were practically invisible was perched upon a rusted signpost, and above that, a smudged green sign that read “Cnty Hwy X” shone dimly in my headlights. 

I made the right turn onto the highway, and my headlights barely lit up the narrow road ahead. The rest of the landscape was impenetrable darkness, with only the outlines of those dead trees showing up as silhouettes against the night sky. There was no moon or clouds, though even this far out from the city there were only a couple of dim stars visible. 

My two friends in the back seat started laughing nervously. As I crept down the highway, passing a bent speed limit sign, I turned around briefly to see what they thought was so funny. My friend in the front seat spoke up, “What are you laughing at? Did you set up some prank out here?” The backseaters shook their heads slowly, and stopped laughing, a very morose look coming over their faces. I turned back to pay attention to the road. I had a slight feeling I might be driving into a setup.

We were about two miles down the highway when my headlights picked up a human shaped shadow standing on the side of the roadway. Aha, this was it, I thought. Here was one of my buddies getting ready to scare us. As we drove closer, however, my friend riding shotgun’s face had gone as white as a sheet. I squinted at the figure on the side of the road, trying to get a better look. As my headlights lit it up, I suddenly wished I’d hadn’t.

“What the hell is that?” I exclaimed. It was a human shape, to be sure, but it wasn’t anything like I’d ever seen, or anything that a joker could have rigged, ever.

Its body was completely black, like some sharply defined shadow, blacker than the night around us, and the light from my headlights seemed to be sucked into it, as if it couldn’t be illuminated. Its face, though, was what made my heart jump into my mouth. It had luminous green eyes set at where its mouth should be, and an upside-down grin across the middle, just above them, that stretched from side to side, and revealed dozens of needle-like teeth. Its color was some mix of pale blue and white.

“Oh my God, fuck fuck fuck!” screamed my friend up front. The friends in back were just as terrified. I froze for a moment, then floored the little jalopy my parents had bought me. The figure on the side of the road jumped out in front of the car into the road. I tried to stop—but I couldn’t in time. There was no car-crunching impact., but the face seemed to go through the center of the car, grinning at all of us, making us scream. I screeched to a halt, but gunned it a second later, trying to get out of there as fast as possible.

“Please tell me that was one of your buddies pulling a prank!” I yelled at the guys in my car. “Please tell me it wasn’t real!” The guys all shook their heads, still frozen. I could see they were telling the truth. “We have got to get the fuck off this road.”

It was dead silent in the car as I sped, far over the speed limit, down County Highway X. Skeletal trees and muddy ground whizzed by, and if there was anything on the side of the road, we didn’t see it.

About ten minutes after we had seen the figure, my car began to swerve left and right. Immediately my friends begged me to stop messing with them. “It’s…not me, I swear!” I shrieked. “Something is trying to run me off the road!”

I fought hard for control of the steering wheel, and took my foot off the gas, slowing us down. It felt like something invisible was pulling on the steering wheel, like something else was taking control of the car. I finally brought the car to a stop in the middle of the road. Then the engine began to sputter, the headlights flickered a few times, and the car died.

Immediately the car began to rock back and forth, as though dozens of hands were pounding on the sides. I could have sworn I saw more grinning faces pressing on the windows.  I turned the key several times, but got nothing, not even the sound of a starter. “Oh my God, oh my God,” we screamed. One of my friends was actually crying. I turned the key again and pressed on the gas. Suddenly the car roared to life and the headlights came back on. I put the car back in gear and floored it again, away from those rocking hands.

We were about five minutes away from the end of the highway now. Almost off that unholy road. I saw a dense fog forming on the ground, only about ten feet high, rolling between the trees and boiling onto the road. I had a real bad feeling about this.  Despite my gut feeling about fog, I pressed the accelerator down further. We were almost to the end of the road.

I saw black figures forming in the fog, rising up on either side of the road. I didn’t slow down to see what they were. This time, though, from what I saw of them whizzing by, they didn’t look human. 

Suddenly the car slid sideways and I heard the tires spinning uselessly. We had stopped moving, despite my gunning the engine. “What the hell, man, get going!” screamed one of my friends from the back.  “I’m trying!” I yelled back. The black figures had started to gather around the car. Suddenly the fog lifted, revealing a cold silver moon just on the horizon. The headlights of the car revealed a vast, swampy landscape before us, and no road. Looking behind us, we saw the highway drop into an absolute blackness behind us, like a black hole. We tried to open the doors—to no avail. The mud around them was too thick, and the car was sinking fast. We tried to roll the windows down, but at that moment the car died from so much muck in the engine compartment, and the power windows wouldn’t come down. Water had begun seeping into the passenger compartment. In my final moments, before the black water sucked us down, I realized something—County Highway X had no end.

97,A Dream My Dad Once Had,1295843783,"(Told to me by my dad)
About 10 years ago a friend of my father's passed away. His name was Marty, and he was probably my dad's best friend of all time. Marty was a awesome dude, and he died of a heart attack. 

About a week after Marty's death, my dad had a dream. In my dad's dream, he was standing at a bus stop. It was rainy and dark, and my dad was pretty lonely. He checked his watch, the bus was running very late. He wasn't sure when it was going to come. 

In the distance, he sees a figure approaching him. He can't make out who it is, but he is overjoyed at the thought of company nonetheless. The man comes closer and my dad realizes that it is his best friend Marty. 

""Marty! Hey man, it's been a while. I've really missed you."" My dad says, extending his arms for a hug. Marty smiles. ""Yeah, I've missed you too.""

The pair start talking like nothing is amiss. Many hours pass.

""I dont think this bus is going to come."" My dad says. ""Maybe we should call it a night.""
Marty laughs and says ""Oh, don't worry Mike, I have *all the time in the world.*""",nosleep,alexi5,/r/nosleep/comments/f7vbq/a_dream_my_dad_once_had/

99,"Help me, NoSleep. (Old Show Request)",1295839678,"So, I have a ridiculously good memory, and I can remember this show from when I was younger (I want to say younger than 10, and I am 24 now, so that'd be at latest of '96?  Could be mistaken).  The show was a horror anthology like ""Tales from the Crypt,"" ""Tales from the Darkside,"" ""Monsters"" and ""The Outer Limits.""  I watched all those shows, so it's possible it could be from any of these.

The episode in particular had a bald man who wanted a hair transplant.  The next scene I can remember was him waking up with a full head of hair, his girlfriend kissing or licking him (I think the latter), and him being excited about the hair.  I can then remember the ending very well because he goes to the surgeon who did the transplant, who plucks a strand of hair, going into a monologue about the origins of it, and then the hair creeps up the surgeon's palm into the man's eye like an inchworm.

If anyone has any idea what this show is called, I'd be really appreciative (it was also substantially creepy, so it's still on topic, I guess).

0,it's probably watching me as i write this ,1295839487,"My family lives in a house that's around 80 years old. Apparently, two people have died in our house over the years; an old woman and a middle age man. This leads me to believe that two ghosts inhabit my house. 
Anyhow, when I was around six years old my family and I noticed that all sorts of strange things had been happening around the house. Things like the piano playing by itself (which we assumed was mice running around inside of it) and footsteps walking along the hallway on the second floor (we attributed it to creaking floor boards) 
One night, right around my seventh birthday I was sleeping peacefully when something strange woke me. It was the middle of the night but my eyes quickly adjusted the the darkness. At the time, my bed was perpendicular to my window, which had (and still does) a set of white metal blinds on it which make an obnoxious screeching noise when they're raised or lowered. As I laid there the blinds began to lift, all by themselves and then slowly lower back down. At first, I thought it was nothing, but there was no mistaking that sound. The blinds went up and down and up and down, showing no signs of stopping. At that point I'd had enough, I screamed bloody murder. My mother came racing down the hallway and the moment she stepped into my room it stopped. I explained to her what I had heard and saw and she told me it was my imagination, to go back to sleep. I refused to acknowledge that it was my imagination, but after awhile my mother had me convinced. When she saw that I had calmed down she slowly made her way back to my parent's room. 
As soon as my mother opened the door of her room the blinds started again. Up and down and up and down. It happened so many times I lost count. I was so afraid that once again, I screamed for my mom. She walked down the hallway to my room more slowly this time, clearly annoyed. Once again, the second she entered my room it stopped. This time she was angry with me, and demanded that I stopped playing games and go to sleep. She told me not to call her again. 
This time it started again the moment she left my room. I knew I couldn't call my mom again, so I just watched my blinds going up and down. I felt something watch me. I eventually drifted off to sleep.

Ever since then I've believed in ghosts. Sometimes if I wake up late at night I can feel something run it's fingers through my hair or breath on me. Either way, nobody in my family believes me so I figured I may as well post it here. 
**UPDATE** Evidently the ghost was not very happy at my attempt to film things. Last night I set up a video camera and went to sleep. Halfway through the night I have a dream. It starts off normally; my brother and my mom are talking in the bathroom and for some reason I'm there but I'm not part of the conversation. All of a sudden I hear noises from the shower stall and I think to myself, this is it, it's the ghost. I look into the stall and can see a reflection of the ghost's face in the tiles, but not the ghost itself. I try to point it out to my mom and my brother but I start having a seizure instead. I'm shaking and twitching uncontrollably and my eyes have rolled back into my head. At this point I wake up, and **I'm actually having a seizure still.** I laid there in bed twitching uncontrollably for a few more minutes. When it stopped I tried to move but it felt like something was lying beside me and holding my hands together. I worked up the courage and rolled over in bed. There was nothing there. Needless to say, no more filming. The ghost is pissed off and is probably legitimately watching me as I type this.

Two dead boys rose up to fight.
Back to back they faced each other,
Drew their swords and shot one 'nother.

A stone-deaf sheriff heard the noise,
And came and killed those two dead boys.
The mute psychotic shrieked in fright,
With words of joy at this ghastly sight.

Now if you doubt this lie is true?
Ask the blind man. He saw it, too...""

2,Weird Dreams,1295832017,"This happen to my dad and myself. Here is some back story. My dad and I are avid watchers of all those ghost shows they have on TV we also both 100% believe in all the paranormal activity (could tell you millions of stories but lets stick to this one.) I understand what I'm about to tell you sounds far fetched but it was super messed up.

My Dad was looking for a new blanket for himself because he gets so cold at night. He ended up getting one from Costco, perfectly new and very warm. The first night he used it he told me he had a very weird dream, he said it was like no dream he has ever had before and it didn't even feel like him that was in this dream. I kinda thought that was weird and told him he was crazy. The next 3 nights he said he had the same dream but it always picked up from were it left off. My dad 100% said it wasn't him in this dream, it was like he was watching it through the eyes of someone else. Well I thought this was crazy, I didn't believe him at all!

He deduced it to being the new blanket he bought, he said there must be a ghost attached to it.. With all the shows we have watched I still thought he was being paranoid or something but he insisted I sleep with the blanket to see if I had any dreams.. I figured he wanted to make sure he wasn't going crazy so I agreed. Sure enough I had this lucid dream but like my Dad said I was just viewing this dream through someone else's eyes. 

The dream took place in older looking time, and for the majority of the dream we were walking down these cobble stone streets that were very close to the docks. At one point we went down to the docks talked to this guy by a fishing boat, we ended up getting into this fishing boat and continuing on our way.. At this point I woke up and removed the blanket from my room.

The next morning I tell my Dad and he was thankful that he wasn't going crazy. He told me he was going to try something. While he was getting ready for work he had the blanket in his room.. He says to the blanket ""Come with me, I have a place I think your going to like a lot more then here."" So my dad continues to work and at lunch he said he went down to the harbor by were the boats are docked got out of the car and said ""Here, you will like this place. Stay here, its better for you.""  That night he slept with the blanket and had no weird dreams.. He swears there was something attached to that blanket and I believe him that was like no other dream I have ever had.",nosleep,wonkey20,/r/nosleep/comments/f7s42/weird_dreams/

But mostly I'd read.  I had a collection of books about ghosts, UFOs, cryptids and such.  I'd pick them up at library sales or in charity shops.  My favourites were the unexplained true stories, like the Dover Demon or the Gulf Breeze incident.  There was a quarry on the other side of the site; sometimes at night I'd pretend the two red lights were the eyes of the Mothman, who'd swoop down to terrorise my family.  What I'm getting at here is I was a kid, and I had an active imagination, but I never believed anything spooky would actually happen to me.  If something out of the ordinary happens, it's just your mind playing tricks on you, right?

I woke up one morning around 6:20.  It was grey outside, the sun had just come up, but fog and cloudy skies ensured it wasn't too bright.  I felt uneasy, because I'd usually sleep till nine at least.  It was silent.  My sister wasn't even snoring as she normally did.  And then I heard it:

Thu-dum, thu-dum.

It sounded like a horse galloping.  It was just outside the window.  It was unsettling, to say the least.  Had a horse escaped from a nearby field?  Surely not.  I'd never seen any horses around here, and what's more, it didn't sound heavy enough to be one.

Thu-dum, thu-dum, thu-dum.

Whatever it was, it was making circles around the caravan.  I'd hear it fade a little as it looped around the other end, where my parents slept, and then get louder, almost next to my head.  It had the irregular rhythm of a gallop, but I never heard four legs.  It was almost like a person was skipping very, very quickly, but no person could be heavy enough to make that kind of noise on soft ground.

Thu-dum, thu-dum, thu-du...

It was fading, off into the distance.  Whatever it was seemed to have ran off.  I breathed a little easier.  What a crazy situation.  Maybe I hadn't fully woken up yet and was having a dream hangover.

And then it came back.

Thu-dum, thu-dum, thu-dum, thu-DUM, THU-DUM.

It was getting louder, and more insistent.  I decided to take my chances.

""Rosie?  Are you awake?"" I ventured.

""Yeah,"" she said, voice quivering.

""You can hear that, right?""

""Yeah.  What is it?""

""I don't know,"" I answered truthfully.  ""I'm afraid to look outside though.""

""Why?""

""I'm afraid it might be the devil.""

She moaned in fear.  Thu-dum, thu-dum, thu-dum.  There was a thump from the other end of the caravan, like whatever was outside had grazed it.  I pulled my blanket tighter around me.
After about a minute, it faded again.  I told myself if it came back, I'd look outside, and the devil be damned.

It didn't come back.  My parents woke up around eight, made us breakfast, and the fog cleared.  We asked them if they'd heard anything strange earlier.  They hadn't.  There were no scrapes on the caravan that would suggest something heavy bumping against it.  Apart from my sister, there was no evidence that anything had ever happened.

Except for one rough footprint outside the front door, in the shape of a hoof.

To this day, I regret not looking outside to see what it was.  But when I wake up in the middle of the night, and everything seems so strange, I understand why I didn't.",nosleep,docjesus,/r/nosleep/comments/f7qsd/the_caravan_my_sister_and_the_sound/
5,Allerton Castle.,1295826737,"Okay, just came across a r/nosleep, so I thought I would share a recent story.

I work as an events organiser at a place called 'Allerton Castle', which is an historic stately home which hosts many weddings throughout the year. 

I was working there one day during a wedding, when a group of three elderly ladies approached me, holding a small digital camera, with visibly shaking hands. The one holding the camera showed me the display, a picture taken from the drawing room, of the two large portraits of King George IV and Queen Caroline. The image looked normal enough to me, so I asked what the problem was. She told me to look at Queen Caroline's face again, and it looked strangely out of place. I wasn't an expert on all the portraits in the house, so I asked again what the problem was. She then replied that it was the face of a friend of theirs who had passed away recently, and there was no mistaking it. I went through to the drawing room to have a look at the original painting, and it was clearly a different face.

I showed them to a quiet room to sit down, and gave them my email address so they could send me a copy of the image. This was around a week ago, and I have yet to get a reply. They may have either thought it wasn't their place, or just forgotten.

I have only worked at Allerton Castle for around six months now, and already I have seen enough to never want to stay a night there..",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f7qrw/allerton_castle/
6,Endless hole in the mountains of the Nevada desert.,1295825284,"I've been browsing NoSleep for a while now, and I figured I would share a story that creeped me out. This is not copypasta (although it probably is now, I posted it in GameFAQs a while ago). This was in my freshman year of high school (I graduated this past summer).

I'm going to tell you the story the same way my friend told me. 

So let me tell you a story my dad told me a while back. He and his friends were driving through the mountains on their quads (ATVs) and they would do this thing that would get their blood pumping. What they did was attach giant flashlights to the front of their quads, and then drive through the giant caves in the mountains. They would be in a line, sort of like a convoy, each following the person in front of them. 

Well, the leader was going, going, and going, until he simply disappeared. The guy behind him stopped at the very last second, almost falling in what they realized was a giant hole. The hole was massive, and the thing that my dad realized later on was that he didn't hear anything smash against the ground at the end of the hole. They all took their flashlights and beamed them down the hole, but they weren't strong enough to see the end.

Eventually they contacted the authorities, and had a big ol' crane brought in. One guy with a flashlight got on the end of the steel rope and the crane lowered him as far as it could, but the hole never seemed to end. The crane eventually ran out of rope, so they pulled the guy up and he said that all he could see was soil. He said that there was a lot more room beneath him, and that trying to shine the light downwards didn't help.

My dad and his friends tried to find other help, but nothing worked. They came back to the site a couple of months later and found that it was closed shut with grated steel, like the stuff that manholes are made of.

They never did find the guy who fell, and my dad and his friends never came back after that.

Edited: never game back after that.

7,Creepy shadows,1295825125,"This happened Thursday night (well more like morning.)

I started going to bible study recently, since a friend invited me, but wasn't really religious before. After bible study on Thursday, I got home pretty late and was getting ready for sleep. So I was taking off my socks, and I look up, there's a shadow near the ceiling, it looked like somebody's head. I'm not scared easily, but this made me get goosebumps. I grabbed my dog and kept her close cause I was so scared, lol.

This is the second time I see this shadow. The other time, I woke up at 4 am and went to go get a glass of water, so I turned on the lights. I saw a shadow heading up the stairs, everyone else in the house was asleep.

These shadows all appeared after I started going to bible study, my mom thinks they're related events. I doubt it, but it is a possibility. Anyone experience anything similar?",nosleep,drebot,/r/nosleep/comments/f7qc2/creepy_shadows/
8,My experience in an old French 'haunted' hotel,1295824421,"I was going to post this as comment but the story got a little long. Anyway, here follows my account of the time I stayed in an old 'haunted' hotel in Southern France.

I went to have my internship in this little village in southern France called Foix, in the department if Ariege. My boss knew the owner of this hotel and he made an arrangement so I could stay there for a few months, which I did. The Village had about 5k people. 

Anyway, I went to this hotel, three stories with also a basement and a garage. It was fairly old, 200+ years overlooking the city centre, an old fortress and the stunning mountains. 

I arrived in the beginning of winter, it was very low season and they had closed the hotel for renovation, they would only accept guests by appointment. For the first week they keep people in the reception but I told them I didn't really need any service, just a place to crash, internet and that was it. I had the key to the front door and they told me that they would close up.  Long story short I was the only living soul in that house, I would come home from work to find a completely darkened entrance, I would then turn on the lights and slowly climb the stairs. I stayed first on the third floor and then I moved to the second. But still I had to walk through some really dark hallways, the floors were wooden so they made some noise when I walked by. I remember very well that when I walked to my room, there was a mirror at the end of the hallway which I avoided looking at all costs, sometimes I did look and I thought I would see something, a white hue or fog but I dismissed as my mind was playing tricks on me. 

Once I got to my room I would turn on the lights and lock the door, even though I was the only one there. The rooms were comfy, but sometimes at night I would wakeup in the middle of the night with this ungodly cold, most of the time I blamed the winter and the fact that the house was old, but I am not ashamed to say I used to cover myself from head to toe sometimes so I wouldn't 'see' anything. 

Was there noise, oh god yes. It was an old house and it made a great deal of noise, on top of that I blamed the pigeons. Sometimes it seemed like someone was walking on the floor above.

I am an engineer and I am pretty logically minded, so most of the time I tried to find a logical explanation or assumed my mind was playing tricks on me. The owners of the hotel even asked me if I wasn't scared of staying there, and I said I wasn't. They told me they had a few guests that had been spooked and checked out a little earlier than expected.

I must say that the creepiest part of the whole thing was the mirror at the end of the hall, sometimes I thought I saw a female in a white dress, but as always I dismissed as me being paranoid. Other times I had the impression of seeing a girl sneaking a peak from one of the (closed and firmly locked) rooms as I walked by the hallway.

At the end of it I was actually looking forward to seeing something, but I never got to see something concrete. I confess that I never went exploring into the basement area

I had a great time there and left after 5 months. Looking back I really miss the place and it was a nice experience. I will definitely go back there one day. 

Oh yeah, the village also had a rather large cemetery nearby, I used to take walks in the morning before going to work and I used to pass by it. Here is a streetview picture.

Not the first haunted hotel I had stayed at so I wasn't too spooked about it. I check in at around 9:30, go to my room and get ready for bed. Watching the news as I lay in bed and eventually drift off. 

I wakeup in the middle of the night at about 2, just in time to hear my TV turn itself off. I didn't make much of it because I was tired and already half asleep. Thats when I hear the banging and the screaming. 

""You're fucking dead!""

I hear from the room over. I hear a chair being thrown across and hitting my wall, shaking my bed. Followed by grunting, screams and hard thuds. More furniture being tossed and banged around and a cry screaming:

""PLEASE STOP!""

Now some glass shatters and more commotion until... Silence.

Their door opens, and slams shut, shaking MY room, knocking my glasses off my desk. I hear the chain lock being put in, and then I continue to hear more sobs until I fall back asleep.

The next morning after I wakeup, I checkout and am asked by the reciptionist:

""How was your nights rest?""

I reply in a manner as to not raise suspiscion.

""It went fine, I was awoken by a fight in the room over, but other then that everything was fine.""

The reciptionist, doing his best to accomodate me, tells me:

""Oh I'm terribly sorry, I'll ask those guests to try and be quieter.""

As he fumbles with his keyboard, he has a puzzled look on his face and says:

11,"Old houses: Do you live in one? If so, have you ever had any creppy/strange experiences?",1295817916,"I live in Philadelphia in an old 3 story brownstone townhouse that was built in the early 1800s and has been converted into apartments (1 for each floor, plus a shared basement). The building is in excellent condition and the main lobby and stairwell is decorated to fit the time period when the building was built.

I haven't had any supernatural/pararanormal experiences since I've been here, which has been just over a year, but when it's dark I definitely do feel uncomfortable. The basement of the building is unfinished, and as far as I know, unchanged since it was built. The floor is still dirt. That's where the shared washing machine and dryer is, and I absolutely dread going down there. There is only 1 light bulb, and the basement is narrow and dark. The far end of the basement stays dark even with the light bulb on, and of course that leads to my imagination running wild.

For those of you who live in an old house, what gives you the creeps about it?

My wife was already out there, and I took off work to drive to the hospital about an hour and a half away. That was a Thursday. She was conscious for about an hour on Friday, then slipped back into sleep.

As 9 PM approached that night, she was getting paler, her features more drawn, her hands colder. By 9:30 PM, she had passed on. The entire family was around her.

My wife and I drove home in separate cars that night. The night was terrible--lightning and thunder in boiling clouds, howling wind, but no rain. The weather stretched from the hospital all the way back to where we lived. It was an eerie, somber night.

Eventually both my wife and I returned home and got ready for bed. The cats jumped onto the bed to settle in with us, but as we lay down we both got an overpowering feeling something else was in the room with us. The cats darted to the bedroom window and began purring. My wife and I looked at each other with tears in our eyes. A feeling of peace came over us.

While driving down the exit ramp, something suddenly ran in front of their van.  The man didn't have time to react, and they ended up hitting it.  It landed heavily on the hood of the van, and the man stopped abruptly, shocked.  

The woman screamed when she realized it was a person and began to get out of the van when the man grasped her arm and told her not to.  He pointed wordlessly at the face of the man they had hit, which was visible from their seats.  He was covered in an unusual amount of blood, even considering the impact, and his eyes were wide open, bloodshot and unmoving.  Although he didn't appear to be breathing, his pale hand firmly grasped a stained kitchen knife.

Neither of their phones had signals, so they promptly locked the doors and continued driving with the man on the hood of the car.  A sign told them they were a mile away from the gas station, where they could find help and call 911, but they were otherwise surrounded by deserted roads empty fields.  They tried to swerve and knock the body off of the van, but it would not fall off.

When they arrived at the gas station, the man laid on the horn until a few people walked outside.  When they realized the body on the van, they called for more help, and the couple felt it was safe to exit the vehicle and hurry inside.  Eventually everyone went inside except for a man stayed to survey the body.  The couple notified the local police using the gas station's phone.

26,"The ""green"" ribbon.",1295766401,"Bill whistled as he strolled through the park. He was on his way to meet his girlfriend, Sally. He could smell spring in the air. He jingled the engagement ring in his pocket and thought about asking Sally to marry him.

Sally sat down on a park bench and Bill kneeled down in front of her.

“Sally,” Bill said, “you are the most beautiful girl I’ve ever met. I love you and I want you to be my wife. Will you marry me?”

Sally laughed and said, “Yes! I will marry you.”

As Bill gazed lovingly at his bride-to-be, his eyes lingered on the red velvet ribbon Sally always wore around her neck.

“Why do you always wear that red ribbon?” Bill asked.

Sally said, “Bill, I must never take off my red ribbon!”

Bill smiled at Sally and left the ribbon alone.

Bill and Sally were married that June. Bill found a lovely little house in a nice neighborhood and they moved in.

Bill bought Sally many party dresses. But Sally always wore her red ribbon with each outfit. Bill thought this was odd.

Sally just smiled and said, “I must never take off my red ribbon.”

After a few years, Sally found out she was going to have a baby. This news delighted Bill.

Sally talked with her friends who had babies. Bill talked with his buddies who had children.

They talked together late into the night about what they had learned from everyone.

When the big day came, Sally said, “Please tell the doctor I must not take off my red ribbon!”

Bill was frustrated. But he promised Sally that he would tell the doctor.

After the baby was born, Bill gave Sally flowers.

“Thank you for the flowers, Bill,” Sally said. “And thank you for telling the doctor I must not take off my red ribbon.”

Bill did not understand why the red ribbon was so important.

“Do you want to hold little Billy?” Sally asked.

Bill, Sally, and little Billy lived happily for many years in the small, lovely house in the nice neighborhood.

When little Billy was a baby, he would sometimes reach for the red ribbon around his mother’s neck. Sally would gently take his little hands in hers and coo at him, saying, “Mommy must never ever take off her red ribbon!”

The red ribbon had frustrated Bill for a long time. He loved Sally with all of his heart, but did not understand her need to wear the red ribbon.

After many years, Bill had an idea. “Our anniversary is coming up. I will buy Sally a beautiful necklace. She will take off that old red ribbon so she can wear the beautiful necklace!”

Their anniversary came. Bill took Sally to a fancy restaurant overlooking Central Park. They had a delicious meal.

Then Bill gave Sally a velvet box with a beautiful diamond necklace in it. She opened it, smiled, and tears came to her eyes. Bill put the necklace around her neck and started to take off the red ribbon.

Sally stopped him. She said, “I must never take off my red ribbon!” Bill sat back in his seat with a huff. He looked at Sally and shook his head.

“I may never understand,” Bill said.

Sally gently placed the diamond necklace back in the velvet box and closed the lid. “It is lovely, Bill. I will treasure it always,” she said. “But I must never take off my red ribbon.”

“Why?” Bill asked, as he had for so many years.

Sally smiled sadly and shook her head. She did not answer him.

Late that night Bill was still awake. “I’ve loved Sally for more than twenty years. But she insists on wearing that horrible red ribbon around her neck. I think it’s about time I found out why.”

Bill got out of bed and walked around to Sally’s side. Bill carefully pinched the ends of the bow on the ribbon. He began to slowly pull on the ribbon.

The bow became smaller and smaller. The loops of the bow pulled through and only a half-knot was left.

Bill slid his finger under the half-knot and tugged.

ZIP! The red ribbon gave way.

POP! Sally’s head came off. It rolled right to the floor, bouncing in the moonlight!

One large tear fell from Sally’s eye.

So:

I'm sitting in a small room with my sister and brother in-law. They're from Ohio and visiting Illinois for my younger brother's birthday. We just got The Beatles rock band and we're playing. Our younger brother is constantly gone from the house. My sister and I are concerned about how he goes stays out every night drinking and driving. But, he always comes home safe. Well, when he came home on his birthday, he came in and he tells us to pause the game. My sister and I continue playing, ignoring him, and then he says, ""Seriously, pause the game. Our cousin was in a car accident and he's dead.""

I was born on my mother's birthday. We had a lot in common, even from the beginning. She would often tell me that something I said was exactly what she was going to say, etc. I never thought a lot about it. Most recently, I found I had a bit of a dangerous addiction that she had at my age. Along the same lines, I was secretly trying to quit smoking. The most important thing is that we were celebrating our birthdays in the hospital. My grandmother (her mother) had awoken to find that her lungs that begun to quit on her. The thing that I continue to think about is that she never ever smoked. It's common, I suppose, but I felt like she had taken on the responsibility that was mine. But, the odd thing, of course, is that she died late into the night on our birthday.

The first house we lived in was a little older two story house nestled in some woods near the Puget Sound. It was here when my night time fears started. As far as I can remember, periodically I would hear a very distinct thumping sound echoing throughout the house. My young mind conjured images of skeleton pirates (this was in the early 90's far before the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies, although I did visit Disneyland a lot at this age and I watched movies like the Terminator films and Indiana Jones films to have a fear of skeletons) and other such horrors for a five year old. I didn't think too much about these noises, they were common but could be explained by my grandma (when she was living with us) or as my dad told me that old houses sometimes settle and that being young I was a little more sensitive to sound. So my parents got me listening to music to help fall asleep so the sounds wouldn't bother me. But nothing ever really helped, the sounds persisted and even carried over to our new house closer to my dad's work. I was given the same explanations of a settling house, and while this new house was newer so it made more sense, I was never truly convinced but at night it helped when my imagination ran away with terrifying creations to explain what horror was creating those sounds. Now years later after finding this board and reading other people's stories, I thought back to what frightened me as a child and I had a realization...a true epiphany! Those sounds, the thumps, the creaks, the vague explanations and placations from my parents, it finally all made sense, I discovered the horrifying truth. All of those years when I imagined every possible horror but one, the source of the those sounds were my parents having sex, thump was thrust, every creak was harmony to the creaking frame of their bed. I tell you friends sometimes the truth is far more terrifying than anything any imagination could come up with. 

TL;DR: My houses made scary noises as a kid, but here years later I realized it was my parents having sex.

33,How long does it take you to get over a /r/nosleep story?,1295748591,"It's like the age old jaws ""how long did it take to go back in the water"" situation.

I only ask because i was reading the Slender man post earlier and then when midnight rolled around and i really fancied a smoke (about 2 hours ago) instead of going all the way downstairs and unlocking the door and going into the yard, i just had one upstairs, which i literally never do. I rationalized it as ""i'm just being lazy"" but i knew that i was scared to go out and see something freaky after all this stimulating /nosleep conversation.

Why do i feel the need to lie to myself about it though? I genuinely justify it, even though i know it's just because i'm a pansy, lol. Anyone else do that?",nosleep,Limeguy6,/r/nosleep/comments/f7bm9/how_long_does_it_take_you_to_get_over_a_rnosleep/

35,Harold,1295737488,"Many of you will probably remember this story from one of the ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" books by Alvin Schwartz.  I think this is one of the most terrifying stories of the series:


When it got hot in the valley, Thomas and Alfred drove their cows up to a cool, green pasture in the mountains to graze. Usually they stayed there with the cows for two months. Then they brought them down to the valley again. The work was easy enough, but, oh, it was boring. All day the two men tended their cows. At night they went back to the tiny hut where they lived. They ate supper and worked in the garden and went to sleep. It was always the same.

Then Thomas had an idea that changed everything. ""Let's make a doll the size of a man."" he said. ""It would be fun to make, and we could put it in the garden to scare the birds.""

""It should look like Harold,"" Alfred said. Harold was a farmer they both hated. They made a doll out of old sacks stuffed with straw. They gave it a pointy nose like Harold's and tiny eyes like his. Then they added dark hair and a twisted frown. Of course they also gave it Harold's name.

Each morning on their way to the pasture, they tied Harold to a pole in the garden to scare away the birds. Each night they brought him inside so that he wouldn't get ruined if it rained.

When they were feeling playful, they would talk to him. One of them might say,""How are the vegetables growing today, Harold?"" Then the other, making believe he was Harold, would answer in a crazy voice,""Very slowly."" They both would laugh, but not Harold.

Whenever something went wrong, they took it out on Harold. They would curse at him, even kick or punch him. Sometimes one of them would take the food they were eating (which they both were sick of) and smear it on the doll's face. ""How do you like that stew, Harold?"" he would ask. ""Well, you better eat it - or else."" Then the two men would howl with laughter.

One night, after Thomas had wiped Harold's face with food, Harold grunted. ""Did you hear that?"" Alfred asked.

""It was Harold,"" Thomas said. ""I was watching him when it happened. I can't believe it.""

""How could he grunt?"" Alfred asked,""He's just a sack of straw. It's not possible.""

""Let's throw him in the fire,"" Thomas said,""and that will be that.""

""Let's not do anything stupid,"" said Alfred. ""We don't know whats going on. When we move the cows down, we'll leave him behind. For now, let's just keep an eye on him.""

So they left Harold sitting in the corner of the hut. They didn't talk to him or take him outside anymore. Now and then the doll grunted, but that was all. After a few days, they decided there was nothing to be afraid of. Maybe a mouse or some insects had gotten inside Harold and were making those sounds.

So Thomas and Alfred went back to their old ways. Each morning they put Harold out in the garden, and each night they brought him back into the hut. When they felt playful, they joked with him. When they felt mean, they treated him as badly as ever.

Then one night Alfred noticed something that frightened him. ""Harold is growing,"" he said.

""I was thinking the same thing."" Thomas said.

""Maybe it's just our imagination,"" Albert replied. ""we have been up here on this mountain for too long.""

The Next morning, while they were eating, Harold stood up and walked out of the hut. He climbed up on the roof and trotted back and forth, like a horse on its hind legs. All day and all night, he trotted like that. In the morning Harold climbed down and stood in a far corner of the pasture. The men had no idea what he would do next. They were afraid.

They decided to take the cows down into the valley that same day. When they left, Harold was nowhere in sight. They felt as if they had escaped a great danger and began joking and singing. But when they had gone only a mile or two, they realized they had forgotten to bring the milking stools.

Neither one wanted to go back for them, but the stools would cost a lot to replace. ""There really is nothing to be afraid of,"" they told one another. ""After all, what could a doll do?""

They drew straws to see which one would go back. It was Thomas. ""I'll catch up with you."" he said, and Alfred walked toward the valley.

When Alfred came to a rise in the path, he looked back for Thomas. He did not see him anywhere. But he did see Harold. The doll was on the roof of the hut again. As Alfred watched, Harold kneeled and stretched out a bloody skin to dry in the sun.",nosleep,Pinkleton,/r/nosleep/comments/f7928/harold/
36,The Bear-Faced Man,1295732720,"Hey r/nosleep, thought I'd share an odd moment from my childhood. When I was a kid (I had to be around 5 or 6) I used to live in Missoula, Montana. The house I lived in was very small so I had to share a room with my twin sister. One night I had a weird dream.  I was in my room, tucked in my bed, with the night-light on. Nothing out of the ordinary. But then the night-light turned off and things started to get a little strange. The door slowly opened and in crept a human-like figure. I don't remember much about the entity except it was wearing a bear mask. The ""Bear-Faced Man"" as I would later call it, not so much walked around my bedroom, as it glided across the floor. Gliding from one point to another without really moving it's body, like it was a statue being pulled by an unseen force. I wanted to scream but I couldn't. I was unable to do anything except watch this thing silently slide around my room. Finally the Bear-Faced Man was at the foot of my bed, staring at me for what feels like an eternity. Then slowly, it rises into the air and hovers over me, still staring at me, knees bent, arms dangling. I can't put into words the feeling of dread I had. Suddenly the Bear-Faced Man turns away, hovers out of the room and slams the door. I woke up screaming for my parents.  My parents came rushing in asking what was wrong. I was hysterical, all I kept saying was ""The Bear-Faced Man! The Bear-Faced Man!"". What made the whole thing stranger was my sister woke up crying the same time as me, screaming about ""The Bear-Faced Man"". The next day me and my twin described the same exact dream to our parents. My parents told us that this nightmare was caused by playing too much Nintendo and eating too many Oreos. I accepted this explanation and never gave another thought to the Bear-Faced Man...that is until he appeared in our dreams again the next week. The Bear-Faced Man appeared in our dreams at least twice a week until we eventually moved to New York. I consider myself a skeptical person, but I can't really find an explanation for what happened in that house in Missoula.

39,Slender Man related paranoia,1295699072,"I think it's to safe to say that many of us here have seen and are fans of the Marble Hornets series featuring the Slender Man.

But creepypasta aside, have any of you gotten paranoid about the Slender Man even though he's obviously a fictional being?

I tend to be a little on the paranoid and easily startled side and find myself nervous when I'm outside in the dark or by myself at the house. Like when I was trying to deice my car earlier this evening after leaving my girlfriend's house and trying to avoid sneaking glances at the woods surrounding her apartment complex. There's no Boogieman that's going to sneak me away to places best unseen but you bet your ass I'm hurrying as fast as I can so I can get home.

Or as I'm sitting here in my apartment derping about and reading stories here on /r/nosleep I have a tv in the corner of the living room that reflects the living room and dining room/entry door and I'm always a little paranoid I'll look in the tv on the way to the computer and see something reflected in the tv.

What about you guys? Has the Slender Man mythos awakened any paranoia or fears?",nosleep,Siegfried262,/r/nosleep/comments/f70q6/slender_man_related_paranoia/
40,"Please stop the music.  No really, I need help.",1295696708,"I hear music all the time.  I thought we had attributed it to a noisy neighbor and thatvwas that, and we moved to a single family home 8 months.  But sometimes I it. It's 5 am I have had no sleep 
Tonight, ha. I am in my husband's office getting a book and I can suddenly faintly but cleary heard ""Cotton-eyed Joe"". Looked around the room, them out in the hall.  No obvious source.  The song ended and a new one started but I didn't know it. It sounded kinda pop-like. The AC just shut off and now it's . . . Silent. The music's gone too.  And there no neighbor sharing any walls or AC vents like we figured at the oldnplace.

Now I know some people might think it's just my brain trying to make a pattern our of white no ice (the AC) but it does mnot always coincide, it's taken place at other houses, and I have a sleep sound machine going 24 hours in my room to try to MASK the music.  

It's not happening all day every day, every minute but if I am quiet, reading for example, I'll hear it.  And enough that I can sometimes tells what songs inam hearing.  Once, for example, I have recognized Walkin' On Sunshine and some disco.  Andmnow now, I most definitely definitely heard cotton-Eyed Joe.

I have to admit that for years I have also been hearing, just beyond the ability to clearly hear words, a man's voice speaking constantly and in monotone (I get the impression of a newscaster sorta) and once I felt sure I at least picked out the word .""basketball.""

Now get this.  I have a lot of metal in my head.  Mostly in the chin and jaw fromma surgery in 2000.  I have asked every doctor I see, and in see many because I also have an autoimmune disease and heart problems among other things, and they insist there is no way I am somehow picking up radio signals or something.  But that has GOT to be nit, right? Can anyone give me some evidence of this really happening? My doctors totally shrug me off and claim some of my medications can cause ""tinitis"" or ""muffled hearing"" and that, and this admittedly true, sometimes I get so high off the stuff that I forget whole nights and my husband has to deal with a very doped up person who doesn't think she's acting weird at all.

But I have never had an auditory hallucination.  I've had visual, but never auditory.  And I don't feel like this is what that is.

It's not even songs I like or hear that often or especially ever think of.  ""Cottoen-Eyed Joe""?! I think last I heard that was at a bat mitzvah in Junior High.

Nothing else is going on, at least nothing else that I don,t understand or can be e explained.  Nobody's ever really even tried, and now even my husband doesn't know what else to do or say. He doesn't hear anything, so it's easy for him to think it's in my head, especially with me medical and mental health history.

I don't think that should invaldiate my experiences or make them any less scary, frustrating, and disruptive for me. To me, it's on more stone on my chest, to everyone else, it seems to be another drop in Ocean of Meg's Weird Shit. Rhumatoid Arthritisnsinceni was 3, and ever since, a host of stuff that creeps in.  Just last week I was in the ER with pericarditis.  WTF? 

My immune system doesn't even seem to care anymore, along with many other people in my life. At least not when it comes to things they can't explain or have doctors explain.  If it's something like the Pericarditis, everyone gets it. They are comfortable with it.  It's not ""my daughter is hearing voices"" which nobody wants to have to admit to themselves or anyone else.

I am asking for some debunking, if anyone can help me.  I am terrified of the paranormal and extra fearful that via my metal instability, I could somehow be drawing ""stuff"" to me.  I hate explaining this fear so that's all I will say about it right now.

So, country music, 80's (70's? Pop), some more modern sounding stuff, even kids songs, and a monotone voice that mentioned a basketball. Jotjjgbreally menacing, all pretty innocuous, on paper. Oh, and there's me, a girl with, admittedly, a lot of bad shit going on in her head and body, but who is most genuinely frightened by **this one thing**.  Not my heart, not even my increasing pain and lack of mobioity.  The music, the voice, the sounds.  What can be made of that?

Oh fuck the AC just came on again.  I am crawling in bed with my husband and dog. Any typos or edits will have to be left till mornig.  Which, since it's almost 6 am, it technically is now.  I probably won't sleep.  I have slept maybe 7 hours since Wednesday morning.  That's not helping.

49,The House on the Service Road,1295650944,"I have cruised r/nosleep for a while, and ran across some good stuff, but nothing compares to something you experience personally.  While some of the stories have given me chillies down my spine, my heart never beats faster than when I think of this house.  Enjoy.

My friend and his roomates were looking for a cheap place with three bedrooms while they were attending college.  They hadn't had any luck until they ran across a gem of a rental tucked slightly into some woods and right off of a very narrow, dangerously curved service road off of the interstate in a very rural part of town.  It fit all their criteria and desires, including a too-good-to-be-true monthly rate of $600.  One night, my friend wanted to show us the place so we grabbed our flashlights and headed over.

The woods at night usually emit a creepy vibe anyway, but as we got closer to the house an even worse feeling started to creep over me.  For some reason I started dreading this house I'd never seen.  We pulled up to a foreboding, rusted swingset in the front of this rather huge house, and I started to feel very unwelcome.  Flashlights in hand, we stepped onto the raised porch and my friend unlocked the door and swung it open.  On a hot muggy night in August, we were met by a cold wind from a long unairconditioned house, yet this hadn't put us off.  Once inside the house, it felt as if a stone had sunk to the bottom of my stomach and I started feeling this oppressive weight on my chest.  We shined the flashlights around admiring the fireplace and the twelve foot ceilings.  One of my other friends had started grabbing my arm hard for no reason, and I told her to stop it, she squeaks out a very small ""I want to leave,"" and I put my arm around her as we went into the bedroom.  When my friend (we'll call him Jerome) opened the closet door, my other friend (let's call her Kelly) began flipping out, clawing at me and screaming about getting out, begging me to let her out.  Kelly is tiny, so Jerome picked her up and brought her outside, where she immediately calmed down and instantly lit a cigarette and started crying.  Me and another friend were still inside trying to figure out what happened.  Jerome advised that with Kelly flipping out, he would just show us the bathroom and then we can all leave to bring her home.  As soon as I stepped a foot on the bathroom tile, I began uncontrollably screaming ""No"" and ""Please"" and started grabbing at Jerome and Beth wildly, though I can't personally remember much after the bathroom door opening.  I don't remember anything until I got outside, where in the pitch black of the woods, I felt safer than in that house.  For the rest of that night I kept seeing this little boy when I closed my eyes, this little boy with big brown eyes and a bowl cut and a red, white, and blue striped shirt.  During the night I had a dream that this little boy was standing just out of reach, and I couldn't get to him, and then out of nowhere this red line started to appear from his right shoulder diagonally to his left hip and suddenly his eyes rolled back in his head and his shirt and belly ripped open splattering blood everywhere and protruding his organs.  Needless to say, I woke up with sweats.

Kelly called the next day, telling me she had a horrible dream.  She said a little boy was holding her hand and led her to a clawfoot tub.  The clawfoot tub was filled with blood, and the little boy stepped in and submersed himself.  She tried to pull him out, but the further she reached, the deeper the tub got until, while reaching, her face grazed the surface.  Alarmed, she turned around and there was a man standing there who pushed her in, and she woke up.  She described the boy to me...especially she recalled his big, brown eyes looking up from the tub.  

The next and last time I went to the house, I was helping Jerome move in.  During the course of moving boxes and cleaning a little, we found several weird things: an entire closet in one bedroom that looked like someone had just left everything in it, in another bedroom there was a push-lock on the INSIDE of the closet, the bathroom door was a sliding one and on the outside were jagged holes as if someone had nailed it shut, and most telling were the rust-colored streaks and apparent handprints under the belly of the massive CLAWFOOT TUB.  Jerome was too taken by the house to let these things bother him though, and we began to move in some speakers, despite my insisting that he not move in at all.  Jerome at one point stood and said ""Look, I am not gonna let something I don't believe in run me out of a good deal, I am staying!"" SLAM  ""What was that?""  I ask.  ""Dude, it was probably a draft closing a door, whatever.""  SLAM  ""Jerome, all the windows are closed,"" SLAM SLAM SLAM  All the doors in the house closed with such force and so close together, there was no way one person could have physically done it, and we were alone in the house anyway.  I dropped a box of books, walked out, and never walked back in.

Jerome would call to tell me all the weird things: the randomly finding marbles lying around, his girlfriend sleepwalking (and walk-peeing) to the bathroom and screaming obscenities at him until he left her alone, the strange and gruesome nightmares that caused one of his roommates to leave in the middle of the night without taking his stuff.  And I would just tell him to get out of the house.  But he wouldn't listen.  It wasn't until his other roommate moved out because he kept slipping in water and then not finding any water, that Jerome could no longer afford the rent and moved out.

Fast forward about a year.  Hurricane Katrina decimates the city of New Orleans, and me and my family only managed to ""evacuate"" about 45 minutes away to the same town in which Jerome used to live, just minutes from that house.  Luckily we have some extended family out there, and about thirty two of us spend a month in a small shotgun house with no lights, power, and the water only turned on for an hour every six hours.  So, nothing to do at night but sit around the fire pit out back and tell stories.  My mom started telling everyone about our experiences at The Myrtles (haunted mansion in Feliciana Parish, look it up nosleepers) and we get on a paranormal tangent.  Before I could pipe up with my tales, my aunt who owns the shotgun, says she has a doozy.  ""There's a house, right here in this town, where a family of practicing satanists lived about twenty years ago.  They had two small boys, one was a little slow but sweet; giant puppy dog brown eyes, always had a bag of marbles.  They used to have masses and rituals and it caused a bit of a stir. Well, the wife's brother didn't like his sister becoming a satanist, because he was evangelical.  He raised a whole lotta hell over it, had a bunch of 'interventions' he called 'em, but his sister just wanted to be left alone to live their lives.  One day, he decides that he has to 'avenge God' as he put it, so he went to their house and stabbed the husband and wife to death.  The children were also stabbed to death, and when the cops showed up, there were biblical scriptures written in blood on walls of the house and the slow boys body was ripped open and lying in the bathtub.  Some people can hear screams coming from the house, even when no one lives there, which no one really does, at least for long.""

50,Her House Was Haunted - Part II,1295643912,"As a quick note, I am open to the suggestion that I’m out of my head.  I suspect that I’m being downvoted because people think, in spite of my insistence otherwise, that this is all made up.  Again – I’m not adding details to this to dramatize it.  It was simply the most scared I’ve ever been.

I determined not to tell my girlfriend what I had seen that night; I simply insisted on walking her inside and tried to convince her to come back to my place.  She steadfastly refused but kept asking what I saw.  I couldn’t bring myself to describe it to her.  My stomach was turning almost to the point of nausea.  We sat in her kitchen, with the lights on, and my eyes kept darting back to the unfinished living room where I kept thinking I saw things moving about in the dark.  Finally she decided to go to bed – when she was home, she still shared this room with her sister – and I left.  Walking out to my car alone and looking through those windows one last time sent a shiver down my spine.

The next day I got up the guts to tell her what I saw, and she was predictably horrified.  Ironically, she believed me straight away, she said because the look on my face the night before was one of abject terror and confusion.  She told me that she simply couldn’t bear to be alone in the house and asked to come over to mine, but I suggested in a moment of bravado that I come over and we try to sort out just what it was I saw.  She agreed and I immediately regretted it.  It was a grey, gloomy, rainy day and I was none too eager to revisit her house any time soon.  Before this experience, I’d had some bumps-in-the-night type scares, and one notable occurrence in college that freaked me out beyond belief.  Such experiences tend to be vague and impersonal.  But this experience made me feel *targeted*. 

Then it struck me that maybe I wasn’t.  Maybe *she* was.  I remembered the crying outside of her door and wondered what it was that wanted in, and why.  I felt bad for have letting her stay home that night without telling her what I’d seen.  I briefly looked online for ways to deal with such a situation and tried to sift through the deluge of information – which was utterly useless due to the conflicting ideas put forth by everyone with an opinion.  Some sources said don’t attempt to communicate with it, some said to pray in Jesus’ name over every room in the house, others suggested testing for extreme low frequencies and carbon monoxide poison.

When I arrived at her house, it was surprisingly un-scary.  The house was just as it had always been, the room still unfinished, and despite the gloomy weather it was quite bright due to the fact that she’d turned on every single light.  Before we did anything, we looked through every room in the house and didn’t find anything out of the ordinary – everything was where it should have been.  We went to her unfinished living room holding hands till our knuckles were white, and I determined to say something to get a response. 

“Hello?  Is there anyone else in here with us?” was my weak first try.  Nothing.  “Hello?  Is there a ghost, or a demon, or a presence in here that would like to speak to us?”  Nothing.  Now, thinking that maybe I was completely crazy, I tried saying something that I thought would “upset” it.  I don’t remember exactly what it was – but I essentially called it weak and stupid.  That’s when we started to hear giggling.  It sounded like a little girl playing with toys, laughing to herself.  But it wasn’t coming from the room, it was coming through the exposed vent in the unfinished room that connected to the basement.  My heart immediately jumped into my throat but my girlfriend just stared blankly.  “Do you hear that?” I said.  

She couldn’t.

So, if I thought that I was crazy before, now I was really starting to believe it.  I began walking slowly into her kitchen, which connected to the hallway that led to her basement, talking aloud the whole time.  “You’re just a little girl, aren’t you?  You’re not going to hurt anyone.  Who are you?  Why are you here?”  My girlfriend looked at me like I was an idiot but I kept walking toward the basement and talking in a low tone.  The door was closed, but I could hear the giggles getting louder as I approached.  “You can’t hurt me,” I said – and the giggling stopped.  I thought I heard, faintly, the words “you can’t hurt me” repeated back.

She comes from a very religious family, and on a shelf I saw a cross made out of two 5- or 6-inch, rectangular cut clasp nails that her dad was using to finish the room.  I’m not a Catholic, but I’ve seen enough movies and read enough books to have the image of a priest, holding before him a cross or crucifix as he fends off some evil, firmly entrenched in my mind.  So as I said again, “You can’t hurt me,” I grabbed the cross and held it in front of me.  As soon as I did, I heard in an absolute ROAR from the basement,

“**YOU PUT THAT AWAY!**”

I dropped it on the floor and **ran** back to the living room, my face instantly wet from a rush of tears of fright.  As I ran I heard a deafening noise from the basement. When I got to the living room my girlfriend was curled in the fetal position saying, “I heard it that time.  I heard it that time.”  I urged her to her feet and we got into the car and drove away fast, without even locking the door behind us.  We drove back to my house, her sobbing and my eyes wide in shock the whole way.  

That voice didn’t only not sound like a little girl, it sounded deep and evil.  I still can’t get the sound out of my head, nor can I exactly remember how it sounded.  Every time I read “The Statement of Randolph Carter” by Lovecraft when he hears “YOU FOOL, WARREN IS DEAD!” I hear it in that horrible voice.

We found out from her father later that night that every board game they had had fallen from a shelf in the far corner of the basement.  ",nosleep,keatsandyeats,/r/nosleep/comments/f6p2t/her_house_was_haunted_part_ii/

54,Strange Sounds...,1295631989,"Created a throwaway account for this…

My wife and I have just moved into our new house.  Now it is not new new, just new to us.  The house is about 22 years old and is in the suburbs of a medium size city in Texas.  We bought the house because we are excepting out first child next month and needed to get out of the apartment scene.  So we got an amazing deal on this house.  While it is a fixer upper, it is not in bad shape.
We have been in the house just over a month now and have gotten pretty settled in.  It was not till we started putting things into the attic that things started to happen.
Access to the attic is from the garage and has a drop down ladder.  There is some storage space that we are using for our Christmas/Halloween and other misc stuff and we have just started to organize it in the attic.  The night after we started to put things into the attic the noises started.

The first night we just dismissed as things settling, or maybe something had fallen over, but the following day everything was still in its place.

We did not hear much over the next few days, but we were woken up last night to what sounded like footsteps, first thing I did was reach for is the light switch and nothing… guess sometime in the night we lost power.  I grabbed my phone and started to record.  I only caught a few thumps, you can find the audio here.

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19131195/sounds/strangsounds.mp3

If someone has another place I can put these documents both video and sound, please let me know.  I do have the video from my phone, but there is nothing but a black screen, it was too dark.

I do plan on going up into the attic today to take a look around.


**Edit**:  I just went up into the attic and did not see too much out of the ordinary.  I did notice that my Safety Goggles were broken and did hear another thud, but did not see anything and was not sure if it may have just been my wife in the house somewhere.  I did record it and will post it after dinner.

**Edit 2**:  So I just looked at the video, and if anyone is interested I will post it, but it was way too dark, all you can see is the small circle where the flashlight was shining.  But again, nothing out of the ordinary.  I went around the house and double checked all the air flow vents and all of them are intact.  If it is an animal, it did not get in from the vents and it was not moving around while I was up there.  I will update if anything changes.",nosleep,Whatisupthere,/r/nosleep/comments/f6l84/strange_sounds/

57,Her House Was Haunted - Part I,1295627434,"*I’ve been lurking for some time and wondering whether or not to post, because I don’t want to be regarded as mad.  I’m a fairly skeptical person by nature, with the tendency to summarily dismiss anything that I find incredible or unbelievable.  This makes the things that have happened to me throughout my life frustrating.  It doesn’t change the fact that they’ve happened repeatedly since I was quite young and have only become *worse* as I’ve grown up, gotten married, and begun a career.  I want to begin to post my experiences here for affirmation since this community has demonstrated that I’m not alone.  The following is just one of many.*

While I know everything here is true, I want to reinforce that I’ve not fabricated a single detail for dramatic effect – everything that I write here is recounted as I remember it. 

Years ago when I was in college I was dating a girl who swore that her house was haunted.  She wasn’t the kind to believe in ghosts; nevertheless, I scoffed when she told me in all earnestness that it was.  According to her, once or twice a year she would hear the sound of a woman crying downstairs.  The woman would slowly make her way up the stairs to the room she shared with her sister – a sort of loft that occupied the second story.  The woman would then stand outside of her door and cry.  It rather frightened the two of them, and I could see in her face that she was scared even recounting the story.  I still didn’t believe her.

Throughout our relationship, however, I began to notice little things happening about her house – some noises from the unoccupied basement or upstairs room, things that I had placed on a table inexplicably moved around when we were the only ones there, lights turning off apparently on their own.  Things that cause you to pause, but you can rationalize away.  For about a year, I didn’t have any experience in her house that couldn’t be rationalized away.

One night I was over late, her family long since turned in.  She and I were awake watching Casablanca and I had to go to the bathroom.  Everything was perfectly quiet and still.  I had washed my hands and turned off the faucet and was looking at myself in the mirror when I heard something fall loudly inside the closed shower curtain.  I jumped, but collected myself quickly, figuring that a bar of soap must simply have slipped in the wet shower.  Opening it, I saw that it was only a bottle of shampoo, which I returned to its shelf.  The shower was in fact pretty wet from a family member hopping in before bed, so it was easy enough to ignore, although I mentioned to her when I got back into her living room that it scared me.

So an hour or two later once the movie was finished and she and I were done being physical college students, I had to go to the bathroom again.  As the time before, it was perfectly quiet, and I took particular note of the woods outside the window, which were lit by an especially bright moon.  I was just about to flush the toilet when I heard, and observed at the same time in the mirror, the shower curtain being jerked from its formerly closed position to entirely open.  I fell back in shock.  Imagine grabbing a shower curtain near the top and pulling it open as quickly, and with as much force, as you can – that’s what happened, and I was absolutely terrified.  When I told her, *she* was skeptical of *me*, as I had been pretty dismissive of her supernatural claims until that point.  It took me some time to convince her that I wasn’t making it up – and even then she was surprised that I experienced something so conspicuous and direct, since she’d never had such an experience.

Several weeks later, I was dropping her off after shopping.  Her driveway formed a half-circle that connected to the lane on which she lived, and we were sitting there, talking idly about something.  She was messing around with her bags of merchandise on the floor of the old minivan I used to drive.  Her family’s house was back in the woods, about a mile from a main road.  There are other houses around, separated by an acre or so in between each.  When it’s dark, you can see the lights from these houses but the landscape is dominated by oak and evergreen trees.  I noticed a shadow approaching our car from the general direction of her house to the right, and my immediate reaction was that her dad was coming out to greet us.  I almost made a comment about it when it stopped right in front of our car, and I got a good look at it.

It was simply a completely black humanoid shadow.  Featureless and faceless.

My impulse was to scream, but nothing came out.  She was still talking and messing around with her purchases, and I was sitting there with my mouth open, staring into this black figure.  Imagine taking a photograph of the woods and cutting out the vague shape of a man, then setting the remaining photograph on a black piece of paper – that’s what the figure looked like, standing no more than three feet in front of my car.  At this point I turned to her, still hunched over her shopping bags, to point it out – but I saw something through the living room window of her house.

There was a very tall, old woman *staring at us* through the window.  Her eyes were completely red, like two LED lights in the darkness.  She was leering.  

The room was being remodeled, and I recall that in a perfectly sane side-thought, I realized “hey, I can even see the ladder and sawhorse behind her!”  I broke the stare and glanced to the front of my car where the black figure had stood before; it was gone.  I turned back to the window and expected the same, but the woman was still there.   You know the double-take you do when you think you see something scary, and when you look back you realize it was just a shadow, or a broom, or a poster.  There couldn’t be a more stark contrast between such situations and this one – the woman and I stared at one another for what felt like an eternity, with me mouthing wordlessly at my girlfriend.  When she sat up quickly, she blocked my view of the window and the color drained from her face.  She said over and over again, in horror,

“You *saw* something!  What did you see?  *Tell* me what you *saw*!""

This is already far too long and I’m late for a meeting.  (Hooray for /r/NoSleep at work on Fridays!)  I have to break this up but I’ll post Part II – which was more horrifying for me by a long shot - later today if I have time.

58,Positive experiences that I cannot explain. Too many have happened for me to believe they were all by coincidence.,1295607654,"I'm just basically going to write a bunch of random experiences I've had during my life that I cannot explain, other than what luck I have. If I have any typos, sorry.

Growing up from the age of 4-8 years old, I had the same Barber who cut my hair. His shop was within walking distance of my grandparents house, so going to someone else was pointless. He had a small arcade (about 6 machines) in a backroom. So I would hang out at his Barber shop quite often, probably 1-2 hours a day. Out of no where, the Barbershop was closed and for weeks it remained closed. When it reopened, someone completely new was working there. I asked where has [insert name that I have forgotten here] been? The first time I asked, I didn't get an actual answer. I believe I came back a few weeks later and explained to the new person, that I've been getting my haircut by this guy for years, If he moved to a new location, I wanted to know. The person explained to me that my barber's wife came in and shot him to death in the store.

When I was 8 years old, I lived in Killeen, Texas. I had a single mother growing up, so we had eat cheap and live with my grandparents. We often ate at a local place called Luby's cafeteria. I'd say we ate there about 2-3 times a week at minimum, the prices and portions were great. This is the same Luby's I would always go to with my mother, I'm sure we had been there the week of this [massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luby's_massacre). Not too long after this happened, my mother packed everything we had and moved to California to live with an Uncle and my Aunt.

Fast forward to more recent years. There was a time I was driving on a freeway, I had a car in front of me and for absolutely no reason at all, I got pissed off at the driver in front of me. It was like as if he cut me off, but he didn't. But this feeling overwhelmed me and I got into the next lane driving around him. When I looked into my rear view mirror, I saw him rear end the vehicle in front of him. I didn't realize how strange the pissed off feeling was until a few hours later.

There was a random time where I was extremely hungover and I didn't really want to go to work, well at least not on time. I remember walking into my living room and I see my step dad. He looks at me a bit puzzled (he didn't know that I drank, I didn't start until I was about 22). For absolutely no reason, I asked him could he look at my tires for me? I swear to you, I don't really know why I said it, but without hesitation he said, sure! So we walk out to my car and check the tires. The last tire we check (rear drivers side tire) had this strange rip in it. It was about 7 inches or so long, the tire was not flat, it looked as if the tire was unthreading itself? if that makes any sense at all. I'd imagine it would be impossible to do what I saw with a knife. Peeling would be a better word to use, it looked like the tire had peeled open.

I met my girlfriend through myspace, but I'm skeptical as to why. I was completely new to myspace at the time, I joined it because I moved to Los Angeles and knew little to no people here. For about 2-3 months, I would notice this same picture showing up over the ""Cool new people"" area (this was about 7 or so years ago). It was a picture of her, but I never clicked on it for about two months. I kept wondering, why the fuck does her picture keep showing up, she's not new anymore. We add eachother and talk briefly, I didn't tell her about how she kept showing up under cool new people, I thought it was stupid. Turns out she lives in Hawaii but is moving to Los Angeles in a few months, within a 15 minute drive from my apartment. We ended up building our relationship up pretty fast when she moved here, her father couldn't stand me. I'm about two and a half years older than her. Her father wanted her to pay $300 in rent for her to stay there, she had a difficult time finding a job, they ended up arguing and he told her to leave, move out. She moved in with me and we've been together for a little over 6 years now. After a few years, I told her about the myspace thing, we're both clueless as to why it happened. I wonder sometimes what would have happened had I never clicked on her profile. Would she end up back in Hawaii? Would she be happily staying with her father?

Sometime last year my girlfriend's grand father passed away, I've met him a few times. He was a classy guy, so friendly, so generous and funny. He was definitely one of those guys who had endless stories. My girlfriend attended his funeral, we couldn't afford for both of us to go. A few days after the funeral, my girlfriend's mother who cleans rooms at a hotel in Hawaii was working. She said that she was about to start cleaning the bathroom when the bathroom light turned on by itself, but then quickly burnt out. She flicked the light switch up and down a few times and then radioed to someone to bring new lightbulbs. The person came and she tried the light switch one more time, they worked.

About two days or so after that happened, I was sitting on the toilet in the morning playing my PSP before going to work. It was about 10am or so, very bright in my bathroom around that time. The bathroom light turned on by itself and I looked over at the switch, it was still down. I remember saying ""I'm sorry but Tiana is at work right now"", I could barely speak when I said it. the lights turned off just a little after I said that. The lights have never done this before and haven't happened after that. This isn't positive, but I thought I'd share it anyway.

I know there are more, probably 3-5 more experiences, they're just not coming to mind. I'll post them here when they do. I will say that my grand father has an insane amount of luck. I've watched him play Poker at a casino and the cards he chooses to keep make no sense to me. I've watched him hold a single 6 and throw away an ace, queen, 2, a 3, and then get dealt 3 more 6's. But he acts as if it's not a big deal, just keep going. Like hes not impressed with his own luck.",nosleep,gruftwerk,/r/nosleep/comments/f6es3/positive_experiences_that_i_cannot_explain_too/

65,Debunking,1295568588,"My friend was absolutely convinced her college apartment was haunted.  She constantly talked about noises, feelings of being watched, the TV switching stations, lots of things that you typically hear about in a haunting.  Me and our mutual friends thought she was pretty gullible and prone to panicking over nothing.  She invited us over for a movie night and told us we could sleep over, then maybe we’d believe her about the noises and other supposed phenomena.  Around 1:30 am, after the last movie, our two other friends decided to go home for the night since they had classes the next day, leaving just me and her. 


 I rolled out one of her sleeping bags beside her bed and before I had a chance to lay down, we heard some loud creaking and footsteps.  She was cringing in bed with her knees pulled up to her chest saying “See? I told you!”  It was obviously her neighbors walking around, though.  It was an old apartment complex and not well-insulated from drafts or sounds.  There were some rattling noises coming from outside her bedroom and she was already entering full blown panic mode.  I rolled my eyes and told her I’d look around her apartment to make sure nothing “ghostly” was going on.  


As soon as a I stepped outside her door, I felt a draft of cold air hit my back and something tickle the back of my neck and thump my elbow/back of my arm a few times-- ‘What the fff---- oh, just drafty in here and it’s my long braid hitting me as I turn around…’ I felt dumb for even being scared, but I understand how you can get paranoid by yourself so quickly.  Just having my back to the darkness made it feel like someone was watching and following me, even though I knew for sure the place was empty and it’s just a trick paranoid primate brains play on themselves.  I walked down her short hallway to her kitchen.  Just then, the mini cupboard sounded like it was shaking violently and I even saw it kind of vibrating back and forth.  It gave me a huge start, my heart was pounding, I moved sideways pretty quickly to get away from it, my hair slapping my arm and back again causing me to jump even more.  I got a little case of the cold sweats.  But then I heard footsteps coming from that area and realized it was her neighbors in the apartments above or beside, breaking one of the apartment rules and doing some laundry at night.  It was their fucking washing machine load getting unbalanced and shaking the walls and floor.  


Okay, whew.  I took a few deeps breaths and walked around her small apartment for a few more minutes, listening for anything unusual.  Nothing.  I had noticed earlier her piece of crap TV was probably like 15 years older than she was, and that’s probably why the remote or wiring or whatever was faulty and changing channels once in awhile.  Anyway, I walked back to her room thinking the moral of the story is that someone’s imagination can easily get the best of them, especially at night, living on your own, no matter how rational you think you are.


I got back to her room and she was wide-eyed and asked “What was that loud crazy noise, did you see anything?” and I told her “No, no…just your idiot neighbor’s laundry machine, you’re totally fine here.”  She relaxed a little and I laid my head down on my pillow and felt something kind of hard there on the back of my head and I immediately sat back up and reached for what was on the pillow, but nothing was there.  I looked around for a second and then slowly reached behind me, feeling the back of my head.  My hair wasn’t in a braid.  I just then remembered I had put it in a bun while we were watching movies.

67,11 years and counting of spending 1 hour every night sitting outside in the dark,1295566151,"At 23 years old, I have almost been thrown into this tradition. 
I have seen some really incredible things, both amazing and nosleep inducing. I guess I thought some people would be really interested in my stories. This kinda has an IAMA feel to it. Feel free to ask me whatever you want.

I'll start with one of the most vivid memories: My dad built me a tree house when I was probably 9 years old. It basically sat unused for the most part and eventually started to fall apart enough that we couldn't climb up or step on the floor without fear of falling through. Attached to the tree house was a swing and this is where I spent my time outside at night. Now my parents house is surrounded by woods in the very back and up one side. The tree house sit in the very corner of that which in and of itself adds to the creep factor.
I started listening to music while relaxing out there as a stress reliever. Its basically the equivalent of people to take drives just for the hell of it, but driving stresses me out too much.
So, I was spending my nights out there (Summer is the worse)sometime between 8PM-6AM every night 365 days a year. 

It would be interesting to note that the most 'activity' I have seen was during the earlier hours 8-11ish. 

The most common thing I see out there is shadow figures. I know that doesn't say much, but the ones that you see when your not looking for them are the most terrifying. One looked as though a tiny emaciated child was walking from the side of my house into the woods. The head was much larger than the body and it walked with trouble. It was hunched over as if it was stalking prey. As my back is to the woods that it disappeared into I immediately shut off the music and stopped swinging and stayed dead silent waiting to hear something move up behind me. When I could finally feel my feet from the shock of it I high tailed it to the house.

I have so many stories that its hard to pick ones that you guys would be most interested in and I don't want to droll on and on. If this is interesting to you guys let me know and I'll keep it up.

Edit: Story 2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another experience that seemed to happen often was a strange smell that I never found the source of. It was a very light flowery scent that reminded me of an old women. This would usually happen as a preamble to something getting ready to happen. Every time I would smell it an immediate sense of dread came over me. Usually this resulted in me running inside, but as the years went on I was able to endure it more. Ever since then I have been married and moved into a different house, but my dad, as a joke, installed a new swing in my backyard again. I happily still use this new swing and see much different activity. The smell has since not been around in this environment.

Once and only once I have heard a child singing in the woods around 1AM after smelling the perfume. I assume I didn't hear too many strange things because of my headphones, but there were a few that I would catch in between songs that would stop me cold.

Edit: Story 3 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There was one early evening in the winter when it gets dark earlier that I had a strange night. All the trees are bare of leaves and I always enjoy the scenery of looking through the woodlands now that its clear. We had one tree that sat next to a campfire pit. This turned out to be a horrible idea because all the smoke killed the tree on one side, so it had a very unique appearance. The part I believe is the most strange for me is how sudden this apparition appeared to me. The tree didn't have many limbs and this tree was literally directly in my line of sight. As it was winter, its not as dark because of the light reflection from man made light on cloudy sky's and back down on the snow. So when it moved I knew it right away. I didn't see it climb, I didn't see anything almost 30 minutes into my time out there. 

As usual I got that wonderful feeling of dread. At first I thought I was seeing an Owl, which would have been understandable. I was excited because it would have been the first time seeing one outdoors for me. Its eye's glowed in that way cats do when light glints off it. Probably from the deck light, a dull one, up near the house. It watched me for a while and when i stood up to walk closer is when I realized something wasn't right. It's body was long and it crawled around on all fours like a cat. It would be at this point that most people would think..""Well, It's a cat."" but the head was will very much resembling an owls. It continued to look at me while pacing and no matter how the body moved the head never shifted away from me. I maybe took 2 more steps still believing it was some kinda animal I was just unfamiliar with. There was absolutely no angle that would allow for me to see any detail on it except the eyes when the light hit them. It was quite literally just like a completely black shape that just absorbed light. 

Then as usual I ran.

Edit: Story 4 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I spoke earlier about how my dad had made the tree house that my swing was attached to. It was just a square with a trap door on the floor which you had to climb up into. It was the only way up. It also had a tiny balcony with a railing. There was more then one occasion where I would literally have to jump off the swing and step away because I could feel vibrations through the swings chains of heavy movement inside the tree house and every now and then, right on the balcony above me. It felt similar to foot steps, though it could have been an enormity of things. The weight would have had to been at least a small child for me to feel anything.",nosleep,Iceis,/r/nosleep/comments/f64dt/11_years_and_counting_of_spending_1_hour_every/
68,Something weird happened in the middle of the night.,1295561990,"I have a new kitten who has gotten in the habit recently of sprinting around my apartment at 6AM every morning. Its like clock work, every morning he tears across my loft, clawing at the floor back and forth, back and forth. I'm fairly light sleeper so this type of shit will not stand, man. So every day, I wake up to the sounds of him HIIT training across my hardwood floor and every morning I get up out of bed and open the bathroom door. He's been trained to just run into the bathroom and sit until a couple of hours later when I wake up to get ready for work. 

So last night like any other night, he's doing his thing across the apartment and I wake up. I get up and he hauls ass to the bathroom door and waits until I open it and close him in. Now my bathroom is small and dark and I kind of feel bad for leaving the little man in there but there's not much else I can do, I live in a studio loft that's just a giant open space, so when I have to put the cat in timeout, the bathroom is the only place he can go. 

Normally he gets up on the toilet and lays down on the seat until morning. It's not big deal. Last night was different... it started about 15 minutes after I put him in the bathroom. He was just meowing, which I took for whining. 5 minutes later the meowing became louder and more often. 10 minutes later and the meowing was frantic. I was having a hard time falling back to sleep but I figured it would pass and he'd finally shut up.

Then things got weird. Sounds of my cat went from frantic meowing to what I can only interpret as cries for help. Then came the sound of my cat physically hitting the bathroom door. At first it seemed like he was jumping towards the door knob, to get freed from the pitch black bathroom. But then came the sounds of my cat being thrown against the bathroom door. My cat at this point is screeching as the bathroom door thuds from top to bottom. 

Then I heard a voice, similar to my own say ""shhh"" and ""shut up already"" come from inside the closed bathroom. I say similar to mine because it sounded like my voice but not how I hear my own voice but how I would hear my voice on a recording. At this point the banging and meowing is still going on, I'm freaked out and pop out of bed wondering who or what is in my bathroom.

I swing open the door and the cat is sitting calmly on the toilet seat like nothing had happened. My bathroom mirror is directly across from the bathroom door, through the darkness I see myself staring back at me with a sadistic look and a grin on my face, even though I'm not grinning at all. I turn on the light and the mirror portrays me as normal. 

So I picked up the cat, slammed the door shut and spent the rest of the night freaked out and hearing things in my apartment. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f631m/something_weird_happened_in_the_middle_of_the/

77,My Darkest Night ,1295516143,"*I've always found stories of other's bizarre experiences to be comforting because I can believe that I'm not crazy for the experience that I had about 10 years ago. I don't talk about it much, mainly because I don't feel like getting stared at or being told that I am either delusional, lying, or a combination of both. I have always considered myself a very down-to-earth person who doesn't believe in magic, ghosts, gods, demons, or any other form of fairy tales. Since I have found this community on reddit, I feel that I can finally share what has happened to me with others who may understand that sometimes there are things that the logical mind just can't explain. I have in no way exaggerated the events that I'm about to tell you, I will remember this night until the day I die.*

I was 18 at the time, going to college, working a full-time job, but still living at home to save the expense of rent. After a long stretch of classes and work, I finally had a day off so I had ""big plans"" for the night. I was going to stay up until the break of dawn watching movies since I never really had any time to just kick back and relax. The night started off well enough, I finished two movies , popped the third one in the DVD player, and went to the bathroom while waiting for the menu to load.

I finish my business in the bathroom and hop into bed ready to watch the third movie when my dog starts barking at the window next to my bed. There were a lot of stray cats in the area I lived in so I didn't think much of it and continued to get settled in for the movie. My dog continues barking, so I scold him and tell him to hush. I start getting into the opening scenes of the movie when I hear what sounds like footsteps on top of the roof. Even at this point I still think nothing of it as it was fairly common for cats to find their way to the roof via various trees on the property. That's when things got strange... 

My dog starts viciously barking at the window, even attempting to claw the blinds away to bite at the glass. Before I could scold him a second time for making so much noise he suddenly yelps as though he's been hit and hides his face under the blankets on my bed. I attempt to find out what happened to him and I notice that he is shaking; my dog was terrified! I turn to look at the window and that's when I notice the darkest shadow I have EVER seen flow from my window and slip into my closet. I don't know how else to explain it... it just slipped through the cracks.

I'm a little freaked out and tell myself not to let my imagination get the best of me, but the doorknob on my closet door began to turn and my dog began growling while his face was still firmly buried beneath the blankets. I decide that it would be a good time to step out of the room and see what my dad was watching in the living room (he's a bit of a night owl.) I open my bedroom door and step into the hallway and then, DARKNESS.

Just 5 minutes earlier there were lights on throughout the house, there was a TV on in the living room, there was the sound of my brothers sleeping in the room next to mine... but now nothing... no sight, no sound. I start to feel very uneasy, almost as though I'm being watch by someone standing right next to me. I feel my way to the nearest light switch, but turning it on gave me no light. So I continue to stumble and feel my way to the living room to find any explanation I could about what was going on. As I come to the end of the hallway I have to cross the kitchen to make it into the living room.

I step into the kitchen and once again feel around for a light switch hoping that I will finally be able to ""shed some light on the situation."" I feel a sense of relief when I find the light switch, but once I realize it does not work all my relief quickly turns to panic. I turn to walk to the living room and thats when I feel it grab the back of my shirt. At this point I don't care how many things I slam into, I'm getting the fuck out of the kitchen. I make it about three steps and I hear the the most chilling scream I have ever experienced in my life. Whatever it was, it wasn't letting me get away...

I struggle to take another step but I am forced to the ground. It felt like someone palmed the back of my head and shoved my face to the ground. I squirm to get back up, but I find myself on my back with something holding me down. No matter how hard I struggle I cannot move, my arms and legs both being held by this damned darkness that had consumed the house. I feel something moving closer to me and soon it feels that it is sitting on my stomach. I can feel fingers clawing my chest and hot breath on my face. The smell was so putrid I wanted to vomit. I finally succumb to my fear and let out a desperate scream in the hopes that just maybe... maybe somebody could find me in this abyss and save me...

The lights in the house kick on, I can hear the TV playing in the living room, I'm lying flat on my back in the middle of the kitchen, and nothing is near me. I'm shaking uncontrollably and I'm nearly too terrified to move. I finally bolt out of the kitchen to find my dad who was passed out asleep on the couch. I wake him up to tell him what just happened and asked him if he heard my scream for help. He never heard my scream and shrugs it off as ""sleepwalking"" or an ""overactive imagination"". It occurs to me to check my chest for scratches and sure enough I have three vertical welts running down my sternum. Needless to say I didn't sleep well for a few weeks after that event. At times in that place between asleep and awake I can still feel it breathing on my face.

78,The Emily Rose House,1295513136,"I have a story that a friend once told me that gave me chills and made me genuinely question my skeptic beliefs. The honesty in which he told it and the obvious emotional duress that retelling it put him in will stick with me forever. My friend is a massive, confident football star and he broke down while telling us this. Only a few of us ever got to hear it because he hated telling it. If we ever teased him about it he would get upset. He told the story in a very quiet voice that broke at times. It was not for our entertainment. I will tell the story from his eyes.

""I come from a small town in Iowa in the middle of nowhere. Where I live there is nothing but fields. Small farm houses are set sporadically across the bleak landscape. There is one house that stands out.

We call this the Emily Rose house. The house is boarded up and has not been touched since the 1950s. The fields have not been sown as no farmer will touch this land or tear the house down. No one owns it yet no one will claim it. There was a famous exorcism here in 1928 in which the movie was partially based on. The girl who lived in this house got possessed and had to be exorcised at the local convent. The exorcism was successful but the evil of the house lived on. In the 1950s the new owner of the house murdered his entire family. When the family had not been seen for some time, the town priest showed up to the house to check on them. When he arrived, the man came out, shot him point blank in the head, and smeared his blood on the outside of the house. Police found the mutilated bodies in the basement next to a crude Satanic shrine the man had set up. In the trial the man said that demons had told him to commit the acts and that the house and land were cursed. No one has touched the property since then, not even the local government.

It was homecoming night and just about Halloween time as the air had started to cool for impending fall. We had just played a football game and learned that the party we were going to attend just got busted and we were left with no plans in the chill night. As we drove around in a pickup, one of my friends said that we should go to the Emily Rose house. I immediately objected. Yet he insisted and was driving the truck so I could not argue. 

When you get to the house there is a massive driveway about half a mile down that you must drive on to get there. The house sticks out of the landscape because there are no trees and all the land around it is barren. We drove slowly down the driveway, and as we drove I got the most impending feeling of dread. It felt like every happy thought was draining from me. The closer we got to the house, the more cripplingly sad I got. I felt a mix of fear and depression. The truck stalled halfway down the driveway. It was a reliable truck and the stalling could not be explained. Some of us said that this was a sign that we needed to go back, but the driver revved the engine up and we continued down the dark drive.

When we got up to the house these bad feelings were at their apex. I could hardly move from the car. My friends peer pressured me out and I reluctantly came outside. Inside the abandoned house we saw light coming from the cracks like fire. Flickering light as if the inside was burning. Inexplicably, the blood stains on the side of the house were still visible and vivid. When we noticed the flickering light we ran back to the truck. The bad vibes coming from this house made my heart beat out of my chest and my stomach turn in knots. The truck refused to start and the flickering light and blood stains were still visible. Even the driver was panicking now. After a few tries the engine started and we hightailed it out of there.

My mind has erased the memories of the rest of the evening. My friends filled me in on it. They told me that I was acting very bizarre and irrational. Saying things like I wanted to die, that I wanted to kill myself. It was so bad that they stayed with me until late in the night and made sure that I fell asleep OK. 

When I fell asleep I had a vivid dream. A ghostly girl came to me in the dream and gave me a knife. She told me to kill myself and I did. I stabbed myself in the gut with the knife she gave me and died in the dream.

When I awoke the next morning, I was laying on hard, cold ground in the middle of a cornfield about a mile from my home. About a mile in the exact direction of the Emily Rose house.""",nosleep,theattitudelion,/r/nosleep/comments/f5owx/the_emily_rose_house/
79,stories my friends mother told us about her grandmother's creepy haunted house (this shit kept me up as a kid),1295506066,"This story was related to me and my best frind Jon by my best friend's mom Sandy. Somehow the topic of ghosts came up and Sandy gets serious and says that she believes in them.  We beg her to tell us why and she won't, but you know how 11 year olds are, she eventually relented. I'm not a very good writer, but the story dosen't need much help. She swore to us the following story was true and it freaked me out as a kid and still does! (I'm 30 now).  

This women's mother, Rose, had always wanted an old house to fix up and so after the kids moved out, her and her husband bought an old 3 story Victorian home that was well over 100 years old with all the creaks and rattles that came with it.  

A few months after fixing it up and moving in, the grandma and her husband would hear creepy stuff.  Random doors slamming, neck hair-rasing ""eerie"" feelings and cold spots in rooms and even faint sounds of guitar music!  But they always nervously joked about it and dismissed it.

One day in the summer afternoon, Sandy comes to visit her mom.  Rose is in the backyard picking tomatoes and fills a basket, sees her daughter and brings the tomatoes to the back porch.  They sit on the outdoor furniture and chat and then Rose offers some lemonade.  They both go inside and close the sliding-glass door and go up a floor to the kitchen to make the lemonade.  They get to chatting for awhile in the kitchen and when they return downstairs, Rose stops mid-step and gasps. About 20 ripe tomatoes are stacked one on top of each other outside the sliding doors on the concrete patio!  Sandy sees her mom and asks what's wrong.  She looks out and sees the same thing.  Suddenly all the tomatoes fall and Sandy screams and she drops the lemonade pitcher and shatters it.  They both are totally freaked out.

A few weeks later Sandy gets a call from her mom, absolutely histerical asking if they can stay at her house.  When they arrive Rose tells her what happened.  Rose was in bed trying to sleep, but not falling asleep.  Her husband is out like a light and she is not able to sleep.  She hears a door slam upstairs, which freaked her out and made it even harder to fall asleep. So she's staring at the ceiling and she said she felt the covers ""vibrate"" and ""shake a little bit"".  She was startled and put her hand down thinking it was a bug or mouse or something.  She says her hand reached down and she felt a face!  She screams, sits up, and turns on the light and there is a loud crash sound!  Nothing is there, except they notice the metal wastebasket in the corner is full of WATER and all her jewelry from her jewlery box is in the bottom!  They never slept another night in the house and sold it. I didn't sleep for a few nights after hearing the story since you could see on Jon's mom's face that this shit really happened.

82,An old apartment. Little things. Sleeplessness.,1295491894,"Well, hey. I've been stopping by the campfire for a year or so now, but this is the first time I'm sitting in to add my own ghost story. This thread has always fascinated me. Stories of other realms and dark creatures. They'd take such a wonderful bit of imagination if they weren't true, and while I'm no author I can still appreciate a well-written post that imparts a sense of wondering and touch of fear.


...Can I start that way? I've never quite expected to make a contribution to such a thread, and jumping in without some introduction, despite how corny, feels rude. Here, have some backstory. 


For a few years now I've been living a renter's life, changing location every year or so to declare independence and adulthood and pursue education. None of the buildings (two apartments, two houses to date) were exceptionally well-maintained or pretty, but all have been rather new. Except this apartment. The floors are hardwood, bedrooms are drafty, and its age is gracefully displayed through its cobblestone pathway and general architecture. So lots of minor inconveniences are easy to brush off. My room maintains a chill; old places are drafty. It sounds like someone keeps walking by my room to rap softly on the door; the thin walls are making my neighbor's shuffling sound closer than they are. Scratching noises are above my head at night; dead leaves or a squirrel must be scuffling around the roof.


Ignoring these things wasn't a conscious decision, but it might have made allowances on letting more suspicious things slide. I found myself working around a few other details.


While its nice to have my own bathroom, the noises the fan makes is... uncomfortable. It grinds something terrible, catches, stops, then resumes its discontent rumblings as if chewing through something tough. Sorry, ha, maintenance says it's probably just dirt buildup. The fan has since faded into the background, so I can let my shower-humming override it. Another issue with the room involves the shower. My shower doesn't have any sort of shelf, so I stored the shampoo bottles and such on the narrow ledge of the sliding glass door. The first time the can of shaving cream toppled onto my head I merely replaced it without thought. Even though a tipping over from a wiggled shower door (which I hadn't bumped into) or misplacement (it's been sitting on the ledge at least a day) was slightly irrational. The razor and soap kept falling on me (always into the shower, never out of it), so now they stay on the floor.


A few times a lightbulb has busted when I flick the switch. I'm no electrician, but these sorts of things are hardly uncommon. But... the frequency began to concern me. Faulty wiring? That happens, right? It sounds silly, but I entertained the notion that darkness was following me. So of course, when I burst through the door to catch the train, the overhead light just above my door is the first to go. The following day, the light next along my path is dark. I sigh when the third, then fourth, and final one leave me to descend the stairs in dimness. My eyes flit to the other end of the hallway; no busted lights. This continues off and on as the maintenance crew and light fixtures wage war against each other.


I admit this is pretty tame. I didn't think anything of these. Like I said, easy to brush off. But for the past four nights in a row I've barely been able to catch a few hours of sleep. It'll be four a.m. and I'm staring at the back of my eyelids as morning classes taunt me on the other side of the sunrise. I've never had trouble falling asleep, and dragging my tired ass to school is becoming quite the struggle.


Last night it was some time past 2 when I finally seem to lose consciousness. Then BAM. Awoken by the sounds of crashing and a glass bottle tumbling to the floor. For the first time I can't brush off this inconvenience. A cold adrenaline flushes my system and I fight with myself for a few minutes before the time. 3am. Well, 2:54 if you want to be exact. When I groggily fall out of bed the next morning for class I check the damage. Yep, a bottle was knocked over. The whiteboard I kept above it fell, wiping off some of my scrawling in its descent. The tape must of come lose, or something. But after hanging for a solid month? And what brushed against the whiteboard? There's nothing but a few inches of bare wall separating it from the top of the desk where it landed.  While explainable, the [placement](http://i.imgur.com/p5ue1.jpg) of the erased ink unnerves me. (In case it's unclear, right through the doodled face of myself.)",nosleep,BohemianDreams,/r/nosleep/comments/f5jdj/an_old_apartment_little_things_sleeplessness/
83,My /nosleep Story ,1295487969,"I have a few things I would like to share. Ever since this, things have been happening more to me. I would like to say I'm easy to be ""haunted"" and listen to the stories that need to be told by who ever that has passed. 
____________

This happened to me when I was around 16-17 years old. My Grandfather passed away visiting our family in NM, Most of our family lives in AZ and so did he, He had his house on a big log, It was a small house. He lived alone he was kind of a pack rat about items that he would need or family would need started with tools/wood. But later turned into him saving news papers. He was in ww2 in his younger years. The type of guy that would help out anyone but cross his path watch out. 

I knew that if he was sleeping do not touch him or go near him because he would lash out if he was awaken from a dead sleep. Few months before he passed he told my dad that someone was trying to get him, and told him that he started keeping his guns close to him in his sleep. He did not want to sleep on his bed so the front room couch was his new bed in his house and above the couch was an old shelf that held over I want to say 200lbs of old news papers. 

After he passed his house kept getting broken into, they would take his tools and stuff that he saved up for the family. So my dad told me to head up to his house and stay the night and keep an eye out for some of the people that have been breaking in and if I saw anything to call him because he wasn't that far away.  It was a bit of a boring night, I would call my dad every hour just to tell him everything is fine. I want to say around 2am, I was feeling tired and decided to go inside from hiding in an old dump truck looking for ""action"". I called my dad and said I was feeling tired and wanted to lay down for a few, he gave me the ok. I walked in the house taking a quick scan of the front room, Nothing really out of the normal, Old shot gun sitting by the front door, ( dad said it wasn't loaded ) and the couch that had a huge stack of news papers above it. I sat down and started to fall asleep. 

I was dreaming of my grandpa sitting next to me and when I reached for him he was not there. I started feeling this warm feeling on my face, Like the kind of warm feeling you would get when the sun peaks though the shades. So I woke up, but around the house it was not the same, like everything was new, the couch the table in front of me with the front door open. I heard my grandpa call my name so I got up walked out the front door it was bright as day I want to say it felt like it was around noon. I saw my grand father in the middle of the front yard, Looked around saw that his junk and cars that he had in the front yard was not there any more that dump truck was in a different spot in the yard. I got to him and fell to my knees, telling him what is going on where am I. Last thing he said was ""I wanted to make sure you where alright!"" as soon as he said that I saw my dad but as a little kid running up to us and when my dad reached out with his hand and touched my shoulder.

As soon as he touched my shoulder I closed my eyes, I'm in the front yard its 4 am still dark and its my dad there asking what is going on. Few seconds later we hear 1 gun shot then an other sound from the shot gun. My dad ran up to the house and found that the stack of news papers had fallen. What the guns shots where, there was a hand gun in one of the middle stacks of news papers, and well if I was sleeping on the couch and everything had fallen on me, the hand gun hit the floor and where my head was laying I would have been shot, and when the news papers hit the coffee and this figurine hit the shot gun and if I was laying down I would have been shot in the chest. I was completely in shock the whole time. 

Later on I explained to my dad where the dump truck was in the yard and how I saw him. What was the most shocking part of this was  my dad said yeah he remembered when he was little there was a guy talking with my grandpa in the same spot on his knees I was in, and when he was little and how when he reached for him my dad passed out. 

I wish I could explain this but I couldn't. My dad and I have gotten closer because of this. I have more to share and will be posting them but for now I need to pack up and head home from work. 

Take care

85,Light Column,1295486254,"Can anyone explain this phenomena (if it even is one):  A relative of mine saw this in his backyard one morning about 4 years ago right before heading to work.  It was a long (maybe 20 ft high or more), perfectly cylindrical column of light that started at the ground and went straight up, fading toward the top.  He could see through it.  There were no trees around so it wasn’t a light ray going through trees, and it remained stationary for 2-5 minutes before disappearing.  He watched it from his deck but was too scared to get much closer.  It was really eerie.  He asked me to help him figure out what the hell it was, and I kept thinking of things but nothing I thought of matched the description. 
   

My attempted explanations:  

1)	 A charged air channel like that gets formed before lighting strikes the ground.  However, those are much thinner in diameter than this column and probably aren’t visible, plus there wasn’t a storm.


2)	A certain type of insects can form tall columns that go up several feet during mating.  I think it’s mayflies or something, but it usually happens above water.   He said it wasn’t insects, though.


3)	My best explanation is a [light pillar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pillar) but it was a warm day, there were no ice crystals and he wasn’t looking towards the sun.  


Anyway, sorry if this doesn’t belong in nosleep, but it definitely cost him sleep trying to figure it out.

86,Horseman on the Roof,1295482794,"My mother told me this story a couple years ago so a few of the details are fuzzy. My grandpa and his brother were working on the roof of one of the houses one day and decided to take a photograph of the brother and the new roof/scenery (I'm not sure.) Just as my grandpa takes the shot the brother feels as if he's being pushed off of the roof and stumbles a bit. When they develop the photograph they find a transparent image of a man in some sort of uniform riding a horse.
My mother has seen the photograph with her own eyes and wishes she had it, but it got lost somewhere when they moved to the United States. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f5glp/horseman_on_the_roof/

89,Never knew what to do with these...  Figured this is the perfect place to show them.,1295475063,"So here is some back story.  I have been involved with audio for over 15 years.  I own a recording studio and have a pretty good understanding of sound.  I had a musician into the studio about 4 years ago recording some acoustic tracks and she was asking me about EVPs.  She had done some recordings with a hand held mini cassette recorder at a abandoned psychiatric hospital in central IL.  She wanted me to convert the tracks to digital format and try to cleanup/islolate some of the phenonoms she heard on the tape. I obliged. 

I dumped the tacks to the computer and started looking at the waveforms (squiggly audio things).  Here is the thing about waveforms, they are very predictable.  There is this thing called the zero point, when sound is recorded the sound wave starts at the zero point moves upward and downward across the zero point hundreds of times a second.  At no time dose audio exist entirely above or below the zero point, it just does not happen.  Anyways i'm looking at the waveforms a notice a very strange thing that to this day sends shivers down my spine.  At every point that my client told me she heard something I would find seconds of audio existing under the zero point.   

The reason this is interesting is, when recording EVPs (or as I understand it) the person recording dose not hear anything until the tape is played back.  I think this can be explained by what I found in these waveforms.  The cassette did not record audio as we know it, it recorded something completely different.  Here are the pictures.

90,Shadows.,1295471745,"I grew up in rural Missouri, out in the woods, where not much happens, weird or otherwise.  But this story still follows me.  I was staying at my friend Brian's house my 8th grade year of school, and crashed on a cot in his room.  He didn't live in an old house, there were no Indian burial grounds, or old churches anywhere near by, but the place always gave me the creeps just a little.  We had crashed out, and I never remember falling asleep, but this was definitely a dream, and it's where all the weirdness with this whole area of Missouri began. 

I realized in the dream that somehow my hands and arms were bound, though there were no ropes or anything, but it felt as if there were straps around my wrists, ankles, and neck.  The door to Brian's room slowly opened, and there was faint blue light spilling in.  12 figures in black robes entered the room, floating, as if they didn't need their legs. They circled around me, 5 on each side, and one at the head and foot of the cot. They all closed in until the were touching shoulders, and I could see nothing but them.  They stood staring, and the only thing I could define of their face were the two tiny glints on their eyes inside the hoods.  The one at the foot of the bed finally said ""have it follow this one too."" they nodded, and left. As soon as the bedroom door closed, I woke up.  Gasping.  Brian was already awake.  He proceeded to detail the recurring dream that always woke him, which of course was 12 fucking robed figures that assembled around him, and spoke about him...

The next few years were peppered with weird sightings of an odd shadow that appeared sometimes around me, and stalked like a big cat, only BIG.  Fast forward to driver's license time.  We're cruising in my old beater chevette, which has been converted solely to do stupid shit on dirt roads.  We're out broad-sliding and such, when we drift to line up with a road that T'd in to the one were on.  When we came around the corner and could now see down the new road, our headlights shine directly against the most chilling thing I've ever seen.  a shadow, a HUGE shadow, was being cast by my headlights. It was of a cat, a huge cat, skulking slowly towards the car.  It was close too, close enough that the two headlights cast two distinct shadows, and we could see the point at which whatever was casting the shadow should be standing, but it was empty.  We immediately hauled ass in the direction in which we came, only to see ti once more, MILES away, only minutes later.  This time it was after we parked the car at home, and we heard it breathing.  This time the shadow appeared in the beam of a yard light, it just appeared suddenly, and again, it was skulking slowly towards us,  I could feel something looking at me, inspecting me.  Then it was gone.  

I still see shadows where they shouldn't be, and occasionally I still have the dream with the robed figures, though now they don't say anything. They just stare.",nosleep,Oddgenetix,/r/nosleep/comments/f5cu2/shadows/
91,There was a boat that had seen little use,1295469665,"There was a boat that had seen little use. A few people commented on it. “I bet that thing would sink in a bathtub.” “I wonder if it would burn up in that toxic pond.” Nobody had ever seen it in use. It was just parked in the same place day in and day out. It was a mossy green color and little more than five feet long. It was made of cast metal and it had a little Sears badge on the back right side, but it didn’t look like one that had ever been used by the company. It had seen better days, but it was a mystery when those days were. Legends passed down from senior to freshman about drunken trips at midnight in the little green dingy. The legends were a lie, but every night the boat took a trip to the center of the pond, that part was true enough. But it was not piloted by drunks. It wasn’t piloted by sober students, either. No, that boat only transported the sleepers. Each night one student walked wide eyed but not seeing down to the boat’s moor and sat on the middle plank. The plank always creaked but never cracked. Then invisible hands pushed off from the grass the ghost ship rested on and began the slow journey to the center of the pond.

During the day the pond was a peaceful respite for wary college students. There were four benches sprinkled along its edge: one at the south end, another at the southwest end near the Chemistry building. The other two were parked near the boat on the north side of the pond. A student could sit on any of the branches and listen to the chirping of various birds in the trees and could watch turtles poke their heads out of the water. It couldn't have been more than five feet deep in the middle of the pond, and even that seemed like a bit much. There was always a breeze blowing off the pond. 

At night the pond took on a more ominous tone. There were no birds chirping and the water’s surface was never broken by the wind or turtles. The trees reflected back in the moonlight so it seemed like a gray mirror. This was when the ghost ship took its sleeping passengers to their destination. As the boat floated towards the center it didn’t even produce a wake. There was no sound of the water lapping against the little boat’s metal hull. There was nothing in the center of the lake for the sleeping students to see, not in this world. They would tell stories the next day about a horrible dream where they almost died on a huge old slave ship or an ancient schooner or even a dream version of the Titanic. The little green boat just brings them out to the middle, the students provide the nightmares. After a few minutes, the ghost ship turns around and sails back to its harbor between the birch trees. Its passenger will get out and return to their bed. From that day on they will be afraid to even think about the pond, and they will never go near it if they can avoid it. Those are the lucky ones. They can forget the details and live their lives and only return to the boat in dreams.

There are a few who never live like they did before their trip to the middle of the pond. The conditions have to be just right, but if there is a full moon in a cloudless sky during your journey on the ghost ship you won’t be able to move on. You will be drawn back. You’ll be afraid, you can never not be afraid after your trip. Soon you will be at the pond every day, making excuses by it but you’ll feel a chill on the sunniest day. After a month you won’t be satisfied by just walking by the pond. You’ll stand at the edge and still feel pulled to go closer, closer, closer until you reach the center. You won’t go into the water, not during the day, but you’ll return late at night, when everybody is sleeping. You’ll take the first step into the old pond and you won’t be able to stop, even thought the first step will wake you from your stupor. By then the pond has you and it won’t let you go. You keep walking towards the center, protesting on the inside but serene on the outside. You go in up to your ankles, then you knees, then your waist. By the time your chest is under water, you’ll have abandoned any hope you had that the pond was going to be shallow. The five foot depth in the day has turned into a bottomless trench. But you’ll continue to walk. In seconds you’ll take your last breath and your head will sink below the mirror of the pond’s surface. You won’t stop walking, though, until you reach the center of the pond. Here you’ll realize that there have been hundreds if not thousands of unlucky students that have taken the same trip as yours, and there will be more and more joining your unhappy new family at the bottom of the pond. Nobody will notice that you are gone. They will forget you ever existed. The ghost ship will take care of that. And still people will walk by your grave and laugh about the rusty old boat that couldn't go a foot without sinking while you and your unfortunate companions rot in untold depths beneath the five foot deep pond.",nosleep,Junior1919,/r/nosleep/comments/f5c1x/there_was_a_boat_that_had_seen_little_use/
92,"I think I improved the ""Tale of a New York Subway"" story.",1295466705,"A girl named Laura was traveling back to her apartment from work late at night in New York City. She was a little nervous about taking the subway so late at night, but she figured that there would probably not be many people riding it, so she decided to forgo a cab and take the subway anyway.

When she got on the subway she was surprised to see that were in fact three people already sitting there: two large, suited men in dark sunglasses and and little girl in between them. Laura was surprised to see such a young girl on the subway at this time of night, but based on how she was dressed and her designer sunglasses, Laura figured the suited men were escorts or bodyguards for the daughter of someone wealthy. Laura took her seat across from the trio; if anybody else gave her trouble, she was sure the strong men would help her out.

At the next stop, a man in his late twenties or early thirties got onto the subway at the other end of the car from Laura. He was clearly very, very tired and quite unkempt. His shirt was wrinkled and definitely not clean and he had what looked like a few day's worth of stubble. The man was exactly the type of individual Laura hoped to avoid on her ride home, but the bedraggled figure was certainly no match for the men who sat across from her.
As the subway moved on, though, Laura noticed something very odd. The man at the other end of the car would glance up, look slowly at Laura, then at the men, then at the girl, and back to Laura. He did this several times before the next stop, at which point he got up and moved a few seats closer to Laura, the men, and the little girl. Understandably nervous at this point, Laura was still confident the suited men could fight off the creep.

However, the men didn't move even as the homeless-looking man repeated the process of looking at the other passengers before moving a few seats down. After several stops, he was seated almost right next to Laura, and yet she was the only one who seemed to be bothered (the suited men and the girl stayed put).

Laura's heart pounded as she counted two more stops until her apartment. How much closer would the suited men allow the threat to go? With dread, Laura realized the subway was slowing as it approached the next station. The instant the doors opened, the sketchy man grabbed her around the waist and carried Laura, screaming, out of the subway. The man ran with Laura over his shoulder as fast as he could, visions of being robbed, raped, or murdered flashing through her mind. Eventually, the man set her down. He was panting. He quickly gasped out, ""Ma'am, I need you to calm down. My name is John, I'm a student as Columbia Medical school, I work with cadavers all day, and I guarantee that that little girl was not alive. That little girl was no more! She has ceased to be! She's expired and gone to meet her maker! She's a stiff! Bereft of life, she rests in peace! If they hadn't nailed her to the subway she'd be pushing up the daisies! Her metabolic processes are now history! She's off the twig! She's kicked the bucket, she's shuffled off her mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisible!! THAT WAS AN EX LITTLE GIRL!!""",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f5ayj/i_think_i_improved_the_tale_of_a_new_york_subway/
93,Creating a sense of dread; what makes a story properly creepy?,1295461497,"I'm going to preface this with the caution that I'm not really sure whether this post is entirely in the spirit of nosleep, because, of course, everything one reads here is true, and so storytelling is an incidental part of people recounting their true experiences.

However, that said, some people are better able to weave dread and foreboding into their stories than others, and I'm curious about what makes one story raise hairs down the back of my neck where another leaves me clicking back to /r/nosleep to see what else has been posted...

I love reading nosleep for two reasons; firstly, for the incidents themselves, but also for the occasional discussions that grow up around them - has someone's telling of something brought on a particular sense of dread? Has a narrative structured one way brought on a chill - or, alternatively, killed any sense of horror stone dead?

Without getting too deeply entrenched in literary criticism, and without getting too pompous about it, what makes a story of this sort particularly effective? (Remember, of course, that everything you read here is true, so let's try and avoid things like ""yeah, I didn't like X's story because it sounded like bullshit..."")

My name is Amy Zuckerberg. I live in Scottsville, New York. It used to be a really nice place. Mr Johnson down the road from where I lived used to make his own ice cream. It was a friendly neighbourhood, a safe neighbourhood. Until about six months ago.

Joey Blanche went missing on August 21st. The police looked and looked but couldn't find him. He had left a note saying he was running away, so they all figured that he had run off to see his father. Then a week later another child went missing. No note this time. 

In the next two months more and more children went missing. Parents started to follow their children to school or even drive them. Neighbourhood watches were organized, but by that time it was too late. 

They were coming. 

* * *

Not many people were awake that morning. It was only a few days before Christmas. The parks were closed and everyone was tired from all the Christmas shopping that seemed rather futile with all the sad happenings and empty homes around town. 

At around 4 AM as best as we can remember there was a large crash as the door to Mr Johnson's house was smashed in. I don't know what happened after that, and I don't really want to find out. The screams were bad enough. People rushed over to see what the matter was, someone called the police. No one was in the house. In the distance Joey's mother thought she saw someone who looked like her son, but how could that be? Surely he wasn't in these parts...

I remember Joey a bit from school. Straw-blond hair with clear blue eyes, the baby of his family. 

The morning after the police had cordoned off the house. Mr Johnson was gone. 

* * *

Christmas day was very quiet. So many children were missing, the town seemed to be holding its breath, waiting. It was horribly cold, the wind and snow was freezing everything. Up until the beginning of December it was actually quite mild, the cold seemed to match the fear that was gripping our hearts. 

January came, and with it a new revival of hope. By February people started to relax a bit. Whatever had been going on was over. March came, and with it the warmth of spring. Night had lifted on our homes, everything would surely be getting better.

* * * 

Matt, Jack and I were going to school together. Mother had made me promise not to leave their side. ""Whatever happens, don't get separated. Stay with your friends and go straight to school and back, no dilly dallying, you hear me?""

Walking along we were joined by Di and Zeb. We didn't talk much, just walked along to school. People tried to pretend what had happened didn't, but we just couldn't forget. 

After school we paired up again, walking home. Matt was stuck lugging his baseball bat home from practice since he forgot to bring his duffel bag. He tried to get one of us to carry it (""It's fun!"") but we all had to read *Tom Sawyer* so didn't listen to him much. When we got to Zeb's house he started to leave then froze in place. The door, which we had taken as been open had been smashed off its hinges. From within we saw a boy stumble out, reaching for us. I couldn't believe it, Joey! After all this time, he was still alive? Then we noticed the blood. The awful blood. It is one thing to see someone bleeding and want to rush and help them. It's another to see the blood caked on like mud, a sick brownish purple. 

Screaming we turned to run home but it was too late, other ""children"" had shown up. I say children but shouldn't really. I want to remember my friends like they were, not like the soulless automatons they were now.

We ran the only route possible, along the side of the house to the park. I tripped and fell, almost dropping my bag. Matt grabbed my arm and yanked me up. One of the Other reached us. Matt smashed her in the face with the bat but it didn't seem to slow her down much. Grabbing the garbage can he rolled it toward the oncoming swam. That slowed them down some. 

Picking up the lid he started running again. We caught up with the others at the park, just in time for us to see some more of them come the opposite direction. Retreat was not an option; we would have to defend ourselves. Di grabbed a loose brick and Zeb picked up a broken broom handle and we went up into the playground ""fort"". It wasn't really the best defence, but better than nothing. 

The worst part was how they seemed to slow down, knowing there was nowhere for us to go. Slowly they surrounded us. I dug out my slingshot and started shooting pencil ends at them. I'm a crack shot as my list of detentions will prove. They came up slowly, like sick, grasping globs of flesh. Zeb used the broken end the mop handle as a spear. Di, always known as a timid girl at school helped him by smashing anything remotely zombie-like that came into range. 

Matt was fending them off on the stairs, pushing them with the lid held as a shield and whacking any of them that came into range of his bat. After the first go, Joey stayed down below and just watched us with his cold, dead eyes. We tried to keep them as far away from us as possible but we were getting tired. Then out from the woods came a man. Mr Johnson!

I was terrified. None of the Other seemed to pay him any mind, even though he walked through them. When he reached us I was about send a #3 lead pencil right in the middle of his forehead when he looked up at me and winked. He pointed the nozzle at Matt first and sent a cloud of mist over him. After being doused they seemed to lose interest in him. Turning to the rest of us he sent mist wafting around liberally and the attacks stopped.

Quietly he said ""Now quietly and slowly walk down the steps and let's get out of here. Don't make any sudden movements.""

We slowly climbed down and followed Mr Johnson away from the park.

0,Bicycling,1295429209,"I used to go mountain biking and ride around in my neighborhood a lot, until a few years ago. It was fall, getting close to winter, and I was out riding in a neighborhood I wasn’t familiar with. The past week had been pretty tough, so I was trying to let off some steam and distract myself. I was thinking some pretty black thoughts about my courses, deadlines, and a girl I liked, who I’m pretty sure could never like me back. To tell the truth I was pretty angry. I pedaled hard down the streets away from home.

There are never any people around in the suburbs, just houses and houses of closed doors and lights behind curtains. It occurred to me that you never see anyone here unless they’re coming or going. That’s when I saw the first vulture, wheeling high in the air. Then I saw another on a branch extending over the sidewalk as I rode past on the street. Suddenly everything seemed very quiet.

I shook my head and pedaled harder. A slight breeze picked up. The road ahead turned gently to the left, and the trees grew thicker and taller. I remembered hearing somewhere that this whole neighborhood had once been forest -- but now the only real woods were by the creek that ran through the middle, largely forgotten.

A great black bird was on the street ahead of me, picking at roadkill. It flapped its wings and hopped out of the way, eying me as I rode by. That struck me as odd. The sky was getting darker, and I started passing mostly trees with only the occasional house tucked away behind a driveway. I was thinking of turning back when right behind me I heard a howl. 

It was sharp and cold, trailing off quickly, so close I nearly fell. I recovered and took off, peering wide-eyed into the trees, not daring to look behind me. I stood and cranked as hard as I could. Finally I risked a glance behind: nothing. Only trees, and a stripe of gray sky. I slowed slightly, still searching for anything in the woods. I definitely wasn’t turning around, but the road made no indication of looping back towards more houses. My only choice was to keep going forward until I found a sidestreet that turned back.

That could have been someone’s dog, I thought. Or a coyote: they’re supposed to be pretty noisy. I started to feel foolish for scaring so easily, but I had been on-edge from school. That howl was still sharp in my mind, and my hairs were still prickling the back of my neck. I wasn’t letting my guard down yet.

It was twilight now. The road started to dip, and at the bottom of the hill I saw the creek. There the road turned right, ran parallel for a hundred feet, and then turned right again, back towards the houses. I almost shouted from pent-up adrenaline, and sprinted down the road toward the creek, faster and faster, but to my horror something to my right was following just as fast. 

Every ounce of my flesh strained against my bike for more power. I barely made the turn at the bottom of the hill, and sped up on the breakaway. Out of the trees came shadows, enormous, first two, then six. I screamed and swerved, but struck a wing and went down. My bike swung out from under me as I tumbled to the ground, but they were already on top of me. I looked right into a pair of cruel yellow eyes and curved beak as the back of my head hit something hard. It opened its beak wide and I heard that howl one last time as it lunged towards my face before everything went black.


When I came to, the streelights were on, and crickets were chirping. I was lying in the bushes left of the road with a throbbing head. My bike was in the creek. There was no sign of anybody or anything nearby. My hands, elbows, and knees were badly scraped and still bleeding, and my head had its own heartbeat. Otherwise I was just shaken. I was able to get on my bike and ride home. I decided not to tell anyone what really happened. I still don’t know what happened. But I’ve stayed far away from woods and I haven’t ridden since. And you don’t want to know what happens when I see a turkey vulture.",nosleep,semitones,/r/nosleep/comments/f50kl/bicycling/

**White With Red**

A man went to a hotel and walked up to the front desk to check in. The woman at the desk gave him his key and told him that on the way to his room, there was a door with no number that was locked and no one was allowed in there. especially no one should look inside the room, under any circumstances. So he followed the instructions of the woman at the front desk, going straight to his room, and going to bed. 

The next night his curiosity would not leave him alone about the room with no number on the door. He walked down the hall to the door and tried the handle. Sure enough it was locked. He bent down and looked through the wide keyhole. Cold air passed through it, chilling his eye. The room was very dark but he could still make out a faint image of the room. What he saw was a hotel bedroom, like his, and in the corner was a woman whose skin was completely white. She was leaning her head against the wall, facing away from the door. He stared in confusion for a while. He almost knocked on the door, our of curiosity, but decided not to.

This disinclination saved his life. He crept away from the door and walked back to his room. The next day, he returned to the door and looked through the wide keyhole. This time, all he saw was redness. He couldn't make anything out besides a distinct red color, unmoving. Perhaps the inhabitants of the room knew he was spying the night before, and had blocked the keyhole with something red.

At this point he decided to consult the woman at the front desk for more information. She sighed and said, ""Did you look through the keyhole?"" The man told her that he had and she said, ""Well, I might as well tell you the story. A long time ago, a man murdered his wife in that room, and her ghost haunts it. But these people were not ordinary. They were white all over, except for their eyes, which were red.""",nosleep,sabersar,/r/nosleep/comments/f4z6f/red_eyes/

The story basically involved a woman who lived alone with a cat. One day the woman got really sick to the point of being bed-ridden. Every night she would try and coax the cat to come into the bed with her but instead the cat would mew quietly and sit by the bed. Eventually by the second day the woman would stick her hand out by her bed and feel the comforting lick of her cat on the back of her hand. This continued for 2 more days when she got better. She walked over to her bathroom and swung open the door and found her cat hanging upside down, dead, rotting and covered in blood...so who had crawled in every night and licked her hand?? bwaaaaa...seriously even typing this im getting the creeps.

5,Mobile Business ,1295408566,"I hesitated before I decided to share my story because it is very personal. I have never shared it with anyone except close family and friends. Also, it may be a little boring at first and seem long but it is the reason I believe in an afterlife. 


When I was 12 my parents bought a new house across town. Even though it was in the same town I grew up in, unfortunately it ended up being in a different school district so I had to move schools. It ended up being a great thing for me because I met one of my best friends and we'll call her Jackie. 

Jackie and I stayed close throughout school and eventually parted ways and went to different colleges. I ended up moving across the country with my now husband and she stayed closer to home. Although we were so far apart, we remained close and talked on the phone often. 

My husband and I had a baby girl while we were living away. I came home with the baby a few months after she was born so that many of my friends and family could meet her. Jackie stayed the entire day at my side with my new daughter. It is a fond memory for me. 

In September, I got a phone call from Jackie for my birthday. Everything seemed normal and she sounded happy enough. My husband was offered an internship that was back in Chicago where we are from so Jackie and I talked about how excited we both were to have a reunion in January, just a few short months away. We said our good-byes and said that we would talk to each other again soon. 

About a week went by and my husband just left to go to work. I was at home with the baby and put her in her crib for a nap. She had this mobile above her crib that she was in love with. It played pretty music and had little fishies and such that hung down and sang her a lullaby. Eventually,  the baby fell asleep and I was sitting in the living room reading a book. 20 minutes past and all of a sudden I heard the mobile's lullaby. I peeked in the room and sure enough, there was the mobile turning in circles with the music playing as if I had just turned it myself. The baby was sleeping so I just played it off in my mind that there was a kink in the mobile and it just started playing again. 

My husband eventually came home and I of course told him about the mobile. He reassured me that it was probably nothing and we went about our lives. Well, we were all sitting in the living room, baby in arms, and there goes the mobile.. singing its sweet lullaby. This happened SEVERAL times throughout the evening..my husband was not allowed to leave me alone in ANY room by myself. 

The next day I got a phone call that my friend had hung herself the day before all of the mobile business started. You can imagine how ripped apart I was. I didn't really put the mobile business together with the suicide until about a month after everything happened. I strongly believe it was Jackie coming to say she was there. Maybe she knew I was going to find out and she wanted to give me a sign before that she was okay? Maybe she was saying good-bye.

I had a dream that I was walking up to a parked car. I looked in through the driver's side window and my friend, Jackie was sitting in the passenger seat. The only thing she said to me was ""please forgive me"" and I looked at her and just told her I wasn't ready to do that yet and walked onward. I remember ever single detail as if it were real. 

Months later I always felt her presence especially while I was in the car alone. I would tell her to leave me alone and then the feeling would pass.. it took me a long time to forgive her in my heart. 

Eventually I did get to the point of forgiveness and alone, in the car I said out loud to her that I forgave her and knew she was still around. That very same night I had another very real dream that Jackie and I met on a beach that we visited frequently in high school. We embraced and I remember my heart overflowing with love and happiness to get to feel her in my arms again. 

To this day, weird things seem to follow me. I was working once and a vase started to twirl out of the blue. It really freaked out a co-worker of mine but I honestly believe its her just messing around with people around me so she can see a smile on my face :)

9,Mom's sleeping,1295392996,"This probably isn't scary, or even creepy, but it's something that keeps me up at night whenever I dream about it.

My mother passed away 5 years ago after fighting an undiagnosed chronic pain syndrome which was quelled by heavy narcotics medication. My mother took this medication for years. By the time she died, she took enough medication every day that would kill an entire family, her body was so used to it. But one day her body couldn't filter the poison and she died in her sleep from a buildup of medication. The autopsy revealed it as an accidental overdose. 

For the last two years she was alive, she was almost constantly sedated. She slept through the day, and she slept like the dead. You couldn't wake her up. I saw her fully awake during daylight maybe once a week. Within a week after she died, I forgot what my mother's voice sounded like because I just hadn't heard it in so long.

For the past 4 years, I've had a recurring dream, almost like a series. It started when I came home from school, about a year after my mother died. My dad greeted me and said ""Get in the truck, we're going to go pick up Mom."" 

It was a lucid dream. ""Mom?"" I wondered aloud. ""Mom's dead.""

""Well, no, the doctors just found out she was sleeping really deep. She just woke up and she wants to come home."" 

This still confused me. My mom had been cremated, and her ashes sit in an urn on my desk. How could she have been asleep and just woke up? Nevertheless, I went with my dad and my family. We drove for a couple of hours, to a lone house in the middle of the prairie. Looked like an old general store. And coming out of it, was my mother, alive as you and I. I laughed, I cried, and I ran out to hug her. I told her ""Mom I thought you were dead!"" And I remember hearing the words ""I was just sleeping, sweetie,"" but I don't remember what they sounded like. 

We drove home and got out of the car, and headed inside. I got my mom a bowl of ice cream. Chocolate chip cookie dough - her favorite. Mom sat down and ate it while watching Lord of the Rings, and when she was done, she laid down on the couch, where she had slept for the last two years of her life. ""I feel really tired. Get me my pillow and blanket?"" I obeyed. My mom smiled and thanked me, and drifted off to sleep.

Now, whenever I dream of my mother, she's still on the couch, throughout the entire dream. She's alive, but always sleeping, unable to be disturbed or woken up. I know she's dead, but I see her, lying on the couch, forever asleep.

12,Three Quick Stories,1295382038,"My most recent story is easily refuted, but I’ll tell anyway.  My friend was getting married at a nice bed and breakfast built in the 1920s. I was taking pics while she was getting ready in the upstairs master room, and decided to find a nice room with pretty curtains or something to take the “bride looking out a window” traditional shot.  There was no one else upstairs but me and her and one bridesmaid who was busy getting ready with my friend.  I left the master bedroom, and just to my right there was a staircase. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a brownish outline of the head and shoulders of a person coming up the stairs which gave me a quick jolt and I looked over, but I immediately dismissed it as seeing my hair out of the corner of my eye.  I went into a side room with nice lighting and curtains and closed the door.  As soon as I raised my camera to scope out the room for a good place to shoot, I heard footsteps right outside and three loud knocks on the door right by my head.  I said “come in” then opened the door a second later and no one was there.  Like I said, easily explained as an old creaking house, but gave me goosebumps nevertheless.  



The second story was told to me by my Aunt and Uncle.   They were visiting the Gettysburg battlefield and went on a morning walk.  About 30 yards ahead of them they saw a man in a soldier’s uniform from the Civil War period (don’t remember if it was North or South) staring straight ahead, walking toward the path.  They yelled “good morning” and asked him what was going on (assuming he was just a guy dressed for a battle reenactment) but he completely ignored them and kept walking across the path and straight into the fog and woods on the other side.  He was gone by the time they reached the place in the path he’d crossed.  When he crossed the path they noticed he was slightly transparent (though maybe it was an illusion caused by the fog) and he didn’t make a sound.  When they got back to the visitor’s information center, they asked if there was a reenactment that was going on, and if there was anyone in period uniforms around.  The guy was confused and said there was nothing going on that day.



For some reason, this story freaks me out the most:  When my friend was a little girl (maybe ages 3-4, and I’ll call her Alicia for this story) she would occasionally say out of nowhere to her mother “When I was your mommy, I remember you hurt yourself playing…” and proceed to go into detail about events from her mom’s childhood that her mother had never mentioned before and barely even remembered, herself.  One time when looking in the mirror, she said “When I was your mom, I had brown eyes.”  This totally unnerved her mom because there was no way she could know this stuff about her childhood.  

When Alicia’s mom got pregnant, everyone in the family thought she was going to have a boy, but her mother (my friend’s grandma) was convinced it was going to be a girl. Her grandma showed up randomly at the house one day and gave Alicia’s mom a baby present meant for a little girl, and said “I have to give this to you now, I can’t wait until the baby shower.”  A week later, her grandma died in a car crash when she lost control on a curvy road going around a huge hill/mountain and went down the steep side.  Her grandfather was in the car too, but he survived.  This happened when Alicia’s mother was about 4-5 months pregnant.

Of course, they never told Alicia how her Grandmother died, or where.  It’s not really something you’d tell a 4 year old.  But every time they’d drive to visit her grandfather, they’d have to take that road, and every time they got to the curvy portion, Alicia would inexplicably flip out and scream for them to stop and throw a fit.  She would have nightmares about that road.  

Alicia doesn’t remember any of this, it’s all as told by family members.  She no longer has dreams or memories that don’t seem to belong to her.

14,Tale of a New York Subway,1295372066,"A girl named Laura was traveling back to her apartment from work late at night in New York City. She was a little nervous about taking the subway so late at night, but she figured that there would probably not be many people riding it, so she decided to forgo a cab and take the subway anyway.

When she got on the subway she was surprised to see that were in fact three people already sitting there: two large, suited men in dark sunglasses and and little girl in between them. Laura was surprised to see such a young girl on the subway at this time of night, but based on how she was dressed and her designer sunglasses, Laura figured the suited men were escorts or bodyguards for the daughter of someone wealthy. Laura took her seat across from the trio; if anybody else gave her trouble, she was sure the strong men would help her out.

At the next stop, a man in his late twenties or early thirties got onto the subway at the other end of the car from Laura. He was clearly very, very tired and quite unkempt. His shirt was wrinkled and definitely not clean and he had what looked like a few day's worth of stubble. The man was exactly the type of individual Laura hoped to avoid on her ride home, but the bedraggled figure was certainly no match for the men who sat across from her.

As the subway moved on, though, Laura noticed something very odd. The man at the other end of the car would glance up, look slowly at Laura, then at the men, then at the girl, and back to Laura. He did this several times before the next stop, at which point he got up and moved a few seats closer to Laura, the men, and the little girl. Understandably nervous at this point, Laura was still confident the suited men could fight off the creep.

However, the men didn't move even as the homeless-looking man repeated the process of looking at the other passengers before moving a few seats down. After several stops, he was seated almost right next to Laura, and yet she was the only one who seemed to be bothered (the suited men and the girl stayed put).

Laura's heart pounded as she counted two more stops until her apartment. How much closer would the suited men allow the threat to go? With dread, Laura realized the subway was slowing as it approached the next station. The instant the doors opened, the sketchy man grabbed her around the waist and carried Laura, screaming, out of the subway. The man ran with Laura over his shoulder as fast as he could, visions of being robbed, raped, or murdered flashing through her mind. Eventually, the man set her down. He was panting. He quickly gasped out, ""Ma'am, I need you to calm down. My name is John, I'm a student as Columbia Medical school, I work with cadavers all day, and I guarantee that that little girl was not alive.""",nosleep,ivysaur,/r/nosleep/comments/f4jec/tale_of_a_new_york_subway/

17,The moan across the hall..,1295331983,"I only have one. I never really believed in ghosts (whatever your interpretation of that may be), but I have had one experience that could not be explained. I probably would have written it off a long time ago if there was not several other people there to confirm what happened actually happened. I haven't told very many people, since most don't believe me (for obvious reasons), or they assume I just have an incredibly active imagination.
So, me and a friend went over to a mutual friend's house, his name was Jessie. He shared an apartment with his roommate, Tim. They had invited us over to hang out and smoke some bongs. At this point many people I have told assume we were just high and hallucinating or whatever.. but any weed user will tell you that marijuana does not act in this way at all. I would also like to point out that this happened in the middle of a Canadian January, so there was absolutely no windows etc open. At first I was planning on staying the night, but there was absolutely no fucking way after what happened.

So when we get there, all was good. Me, my friend, Tim, and Jessie are all kickin back, telling jokes and so on. Even about the apartment building being haunted. Jessie and his roommate both tell of how often TV stations will change themselves, faucets will turn on off.. typical haunted house fare. We laugh about it, and carry on regarding the ridiculousness of the notion. 
An hour later or so, it gets very cold. All of us start to notice, so we move to Jessie's room which has a space heater to continue the session. Then we hear some creaking, we kind of look at each other but no one says anything, I tell myself it's probably just another tenant, even though it sounds exactly like it was coming from the sitting area we just vacated minutes earlier. We were all sitting on Jessie's bed, which sits at the side of the room, against the wall. Tim's room is directly across the hall from Jessie's, so this gives us a direct view into Tim's room. Tim had a whole bunch of shit on top of his dresser (which was in plain view), watches, gold chains, change, etc. Immediately after the creaking, all of the stuff on top of the dresser slowly rolls off.. at first a couple of coins etc, but accelerates where everything is practically thrown off the dresser and comes crashing all over the hardwood floor. The conversation halted, and we all just watched. We were in shock, and before we could even breathe both Jessie's and Tim's doors slam shut very forcefully. The way it slammed shut was just so violent and LOUD we were all white as sheep. 

This wasn't even the worst part. After this, we ALL hear a distinct moan coming from the hallway. It was soft, one of us goes ""Did you.."" All of us: ""Yes."" We were scared shitless. Imagine 4 guys practically holding each other with fright with bongs in hand, terrified to see what lay beyond the door. We sat in his room for probably an hour, before we worked up the courage to GTFO of the house. We all saw it, it looked as if someone was slowly dragging their arm across the dresser, then whipping all the stuff off it. Then SLAM.. SLAMM!! Followed by the most horrifying noise I have ever heard. 

There is no way I could rationally explain this, neither could any of my friends, but they all confirm what happened, the stuff thrown around the room, both doors slamming shut, and worst of all.. that moan. It was so deep, but also very quiet, just loud enough for us to discern. We don't joke about that one, I still get shivers thinking about it.

18,Abandoned house (Coworker told me this story today.),1295330611,"So my coworkers and I were discussing strange events in the store that had happened (The front door opening without anyone there, movies falling off the rack [we work at an adult store.] the back door signal going off, ect...) and my friend brought up this story, I'm retelling it in first person view.

""My wife and I are editors for a local biker magazine. Its a fairly small magazine, and part of our job is to drive around between the towns in Southern Illinois, and drop off the magazines at various businesses. We had a new shop that was willing to carry our publication, so we were driving a different route than normal. It was about 5 in the morning, and we had just dropped off the last stack of magazines. We took an alternate road back, and saw an abandoned house just outside of some old farm land. 

Now, my wife and I, we love abandoned places. We keep a camera in our dashboard to take pictures of old structures and things like that. We pulled over to the side of the road and got out of the truck. My wife grabbed the camera and snapped a few pictures as we approached the front. The door was wide open, mind you, so we figured that nobody cared if someone came in. 

We only got about six steps in before we both felt an overwhelming feeling of dread - as if we had to get out right away. Every instinct in my body told me to run. My wife had already bolted back toward the truck, but I was a little curious. I took another step inside, and looked around. The feeling was overwhelming, and I couldn't take it so I followed suit and jumped back in the truck. My wife was in the driver seat this time. When she tried to turn on the car, the engine stalled, as if the battery was dead. Both of us started to panic for a second. The truck had no problems whatsoever, and had been running fine the entire day. 

I told my wife to pop the trunk, and I'd take a quick look under the engine. I didn't want to get out of the car, but I sure as hell didn't want to stay there either. She popped the trunk, and as soon as I opened the car door, the door to the abandoned house slammed shut. My wife revved the engine again, and the truck started up just fine. I closed the trunk and we got the fuck out of there. My wife is still freaking out, thinking the thing followed us home. Either way, it was creepy as hell, and we won't be taking that road again.""

22,Stranger in the Kitchen,1295321162,"  I have a friend that refuses to get a personal cell phone and has not had one for as long as I have known her.  We're now in our thirties and fifteen years ago this was not deviant from the norm.  However, in this day and age, I found her steadfast rejection odd.  It certainly isn't normal, considering she is a wife and mother; the convenience and safety offered seem to me to make a phone a necessary tool/luxury to function in this modern life. 

So I asked her about it.  I wish I hadn't.

We're fairly close friends and are not the type that have and share deep, dark secrets.  The afternoon I asked we were sitting in the bleachers at our sons' baseball practice. The park was a large set of fields able to host multiple practices simultaneously.  The bleachers were not completely empty but had a few sets of parents and teenagers scattered throughout.

She grabbed my hand with both of hers and looked directly into my eyes.  I could tell she was deathly serious and didn't say anything about how weird it was that she was cupping my hand in hers.

""If I tell you my story, you have to promise I don't have to ever talk about it again.""

So I promised.

She pulled me by the hand to the top of the bleachers where we were fairly isolated.  The air was still and we were in a quiet zone that allowed her the opportunity to speak low yet clear, soft yet sharp.  And she did just that...

""When I was a teenager my parents built a new home on a cul-de-sac in a neighborhood that was being developed. The cul-de-sac had four houses, two of which had families living in them.  The development was very complete. All the houses were finished and roads built but as of yet not all of the houses were sold and occupied.

Our house was spacious.  My room had a queen size bed and double closet, as well as my desk, chest of drawers, and a small reading chair.  I loved the home.  It was so new and fresh.

Picture me comfortably sleeping in my room.  But then I sit up in my bed.  A dog is barking.  Actually really going nuts. It is loud and sounds serious and mean.  At first I was scared because we didn't own a dog but then I recognized the barks as my neighbor's chocolate lab, Duke.

I got out of bed and walked into the hallway. At one end was my parent's bedroom and the other the stairway to the main level.  My room was in the middle, across from a linen closet and bathroom.  My parent's room was dark-there wasn't even the ambient glow of their TV lighting a strip between the bottom of their door and the wooden hallway.  They were sound asleep.

The barking continued and I walked on down the hall and started down the stairs.

The barks were coming from the kitchen.  I turned at the bottom of the stairs and looked past our dining room into the kitchen.  It was not dark.  Someone had left the lights on or was there now.  The dog was still barking.

A cloud of smoke, like someone just puffed a cigarette and exhaled, obscured the kitchen doorway.  My brother is dead meat if my parents wake up is what I was thinking but then the smoke took the shape of a man.

I strained my eyes for a clear look and to help my mind make sense of this.  A man in a black fedora and cape was standing on the other side of the doorway facing the refrigerator.  He turned his head towards me and motioned me forward.  His hands were either very dark or he wore gloves.  I was compelled forward but not afraid.

As I entered the kitchen I saw Duke standing on the floor in front of the fridge.  He was only standing on three legs and he kept on barking. The dog knew me but did not pay any attention to my entrance.  He kept barking at the stranger in our kitchen.

The stranger held up a cell phone.  It was open to a picture album.  The first picture was of Duke.  He held the phone out, wordlessly implying I take it, which I did.  Duke's barking doubled, both faster and louder.  The phone felt hot.  It was hotter than a phone that is working could be.

The man slowly shook his head yes; up and down and up and down.
Without fully comprehending why I deleted the picture of Duke.

The barking immediately ceased and I was back in my bed.

I awoke to the sounds of voices in my kitchen.  I could tell it was my mom and the neighbor but could not make out what they were talking about.  I looked at my clock and it was just after 6:00 AM.  Earlier than my mom ever hosted coffee.

Then I remembered the strange dream.  I looked a my hand and parts were bright red, not blistered but sore as though they had been burned.  That phone had been hot!

I went downstairs to meet them.  Going down the stairway was just as in the previous night's dream but now my stomach was turning and heavy.

I knew before they told.  Duke had gotten out and was run over and killed by a car.""
  
She let go of my hand.  I kept my promise and never asked her about it again.

26,Sound in the woods,1295302235,"Been wanting to post this here for awhile. Here goes.

It was the summer of 2001 in the southern hills of WV. My boyfriend had a Jeep and we were doing what we always did (only thing to do in this neck of the woods) to kill time. Driving around our small county and exploring the dirt roads. We were way up a hollow with my best friend Nico, and his best friend Hank in the backseat getting ready to spark a blunt. Our dog Roxy was outside the vehicle sniffing around. This was one of our favorite spots to chill. It was dark and we had the windows rolled down with the engine off but the stereo on, volume down low. One thing you have to understand about this part of WV, its very rural. No street lights or businesses. You can see the stars and you cant hear anything but the bugs. Nothing but mountains and trees all around us. So here we are parked in the middle of the dirt road, pitch black except for the glow from the radio. I can hear Roxy running around outside. Theres not a breeze around, just muggy, heavy air. But it smells nice, like leaves and dirt. Nico and Hank are softly talking in the backseat. Then I hear it. Sounds like flute playing 4-5 notes to my right. Sent chills through my entire body, I turn my head to look out the window in the direction it came from. Then I turn to look at my boyfriend in the drivers seat. Hes staring dead at me with this scared shitless look on his face. He reaches up and flips the radio all the way off at the exact time I hiss ""HUSH!"" to our friends in the backseat. Boyfriend and I are looking to the right out the window, friends in the back catch on and they're silent and looking too. AGAIN, 4-5 flute like notes coming from the woods only this time its right outside the window. No one says a word. Boyfriend immediately starts the engine and turns on the headlights putting it in gear, I've already thrown open my door and our dog leaps in my lap like she was standing there waiting. We drove off the mountain at breakneck speed. We continued to drive to the other side of town. 20 mins later we're parked, under a streetlamp at McDonalds and FINALLY Nico says, what was that sound? Before boyfriend and I say anything we ask them what they heard. Nico says a flute. Hank agrees. We never found out what the sound was and we never went back to look for it.

28,My Haunted Dreams,1295298476,"Being a fan of NoSleep, I wanted to make sure my first post is up to snuff.  Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on perspective), I have been without much, if any, paranormal experiences in waking life.  Dreams on the other hand have been a source for some profoundly strange experiences.

In order to understand the oddness of the story, I need to preface it with two very brief experiences.

When I was a kid, I'd have super vivid dreams, lucid dreams (without realizing what it was), and sleep walking.  From the ages of 3 - 5, I had one recurring dream, that always was accompanied with sleepwalking/sleeptalking.  The dream began in my room, where I felt this impending urge to run.  As I left the room, I noticed a white sheet covering the doorway across from my room, which was my sister's old room before she moved out.  Confused, I'd touch it, and a face would protrude.  There were no features, but I always felt it was a female.  As the face pushed through, the sheet turned black, spreading like spilled ink from the face to the edges.  I ran in a panic to the front door.  The door refused to open as a flood of monsters and ghosts passed in front of it.  I would turn around, and gliding towards me is, who I later called, Ms. Black.  The dream ended with her raising her arm high in the air, light glitters off a small, metal object.  I'd wake up screaming or to my mom shaking me in a different room in the house.

This dream would repeat with minor changes and without any sense of regularity.  The sleepwalking bothered my parents because I'd usually walk by or into their room and murmur things, which is always a recipe for a creepy night.  This period was during the earlier 90s, and my parents are old school, so there was never a second of entertaining the idea of taking me to a therapist or anything.  Eventually, I just grew out of the dreams until my senior year in high school.

One night during my senior year of high school, I woke up in my bed, sitting up for some reason, to a black figure standing there, with a shiny object in the raised hand.  I started to scream, and my mom turned the light on to make sure I was okay.  This was my first recalled experience with that figure since my childhood, so I was a bit shaken by it, and it brought back a lot of memories.  My mom was terrified until morning, asked me about the incident, but I brushed it off without elaborating too much.

So after that incident, I was unnerved for a few days.  Then, I had a much longer dream that blew that experience out of the water.

UPDATE #1:

Here are the pictures I mentioned in the second update from my friend.  He didn't do an amazing job with them, but you get the idea of how the place looked.

i thought i would contribute my experiences in exchange for someone to give me a tl;dr on each video as i'm too scared to watch alone as it's currently 11.09pm. or i was wondering if anyone could tell me the important ones to watch. thanks.

32,Just read a creepypasta that I don't get. Or maybe I do and there's nothing more to it. Help? ,1295288720,"All this s**t started when I found that little note.

On a square piece of paper I found at the bottom of a box I was moving out of my basement, it read, “HELLO? PLEASE RESPOND”. I had no idea how long the paper had been there, those boxes had sat in my basement since I moved in. I ignored it until the next morning, when I opened my coffee maker to throw out the grounds, and inside was a sopping wet piece of paper that read “PLEASE RESPOND! PLEASE HELP”. I figured it must have been put inside my coffee maker by whoever was pulling this pointless prank, because it wasn’t there when I put my coffee grounds in.

I found more notes, under my mousepad, inside my computer tower while I was putting in some new RAM, between the layers of tissue of my toilet paper roll, under my DVD player’s disc tray. Places that no one would ever look, places you’d never think of putting a note, places you knew no one would ever look and it would be foolish to put a note, because who knew when they would see it?

But it kept happening, and they all said the same thing every time, begging me to respond and help them. Being the retard I am, one day I just got fed up when I found one inside a cup in my dishwasher (right after I had run it - the paper was dry) I wrote on the back of it “HELLO. I’M RESPONDING. PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR SITUATION!” and slid it under a crack in my bath-fitted tub.

No sooner had I left my bathroom did I find another piece of paper, floating on the surface tension on the surface of my glass of sprite I had in the living room.

I carefully picked it out of my drink, it read “THANK YOU.” and in larger letters, “I’M TRAPPED”.

I waved it around to dry it off a bit, and wrote on the back of it again, “where are you trapped? how are you sending me notes?” and, not creative enough to think of where to put it, I just threw it behind my couch. I waited and looked, but I didn’t see any other notes for the rest of that day.

The next day I checked my mail, inside of some spam letter was the next note, “IN THE SECOND DIMENSION. BELOW YOU”. I wasted no time in responding “whoever you are, this prank is retarded. give it a rest” and threw it outside, the wind blew it away.

The next note I got was still in obnoxious capital letters, though it was much longer than before and the last sentence seemed to have been squeezed into the remaining space. I think it was a passage from some encyclopedia or textbook. “The first dimension is a defined point in space. The second dimension (this was underlined) is anything that exists with height and width, while the third adds on length. The fourth includes time, the and the fifth is the past: time that has already occurred and is solidified in time space.” Everything beyond that was too squished in to read. I rolled my eyes and responded again, “How can you read this if you’re in the second dimension? How can you even exist??” I slipped this note into the space in my toaster between the element and the metal casing.My reply came when I brushed it out of my hair the next morning before I took a shower. “WRITING IS 2D. VISION IS 2D- TWO 2D IMAGES SUPERIMPOSED.”

That didn’t really get to the point of how I was supposed to “rescue” this person, which I defined in my next note that I flushed down my toilet.

“MAKE ME 3D” was all that was on the new slip of paper I found inside of a chocolate bar I unwrapped, later on. How the idiot was putting these inside sealed products was beyond me but at this point I decided to play along, maybe it was some kind of TV show thing.

“How?” was all I wrote for my reply. I remember exactly where I put it, because it was the last thing I wrote for a long time. I put it in a crack between my length mirror, and it’s wooden backing. As soon as I let go it slid out of sight and I didn’t see any papers again for a year and a half.

Getting dressed one morning for work, I went into my room and adjusted my tie and shirt in my mirror, the same one, only it was now on the opposite side of my room. Looking into it, I noticed a square behind me on the wall. Turning around, there was none. In the instant before I turned around again I thought it must have fallen off, but in the mirror it was still there, still suck to the wall. I touched my mirror thinking maybe it was some sort of warping or optical illusion, but it wasn’t.I lifted my heavy mirror up from the ground and slowly walked backwards with it, nearing myself to the opposite wall on which the paper was stuck. The closer I got, the clearer the message on it became, until I stopped, sandwiched between the heavy mirror and the wall, looking at the paper immediately over my shoulder: “MAKE YOU 2D” it said.

I moved the hell out of that house as soon as I could. After bunking at my girlfriend’s for a while, I got rid of the mirror, the toaster, everything. My heart still skips a beat when I see any perfectly square piece of paper, sitting on the floor, all alone. I still live in fear of some day I’ll open up a book or look in the inner lining of a jacket, and a piece of paper will flop out.

I check all my things, now. Constantly. I also don’t drink coffee anymore.",nosleep,kellypryde,/r/nosleep/comments/f3x7m/just_read_a_creepypasta_that_i_dont_get_or_maybe/

34,A tale from my childhood.,1295282340,"When I was in sixth grade we took a weekend field trip to Scoutshire woods in Citronelle Alabama. This was a girl scout campsite, but they allowed different schools to have overnights there. At night, they would tell ghost stories as is the norm for a camping trip. There was one story told, however, that stuck out in my head. It was a story about a witch that supposedly haunted the woods that went by the name of Mary. We were told never to be alone, because that's when she would take the children and eat them. 
 
The next day we all split out into groups to do miscellaneous chores for the bonfire that we were going to have that night. I got put in a group that was to collect firewood. There were about 4 of us that went out to collect wood and I noticed a large pile of wood sitting in the middle of this swampy area. I told the others that I was with that I was going to go down there to get it and to wait for me. They didn't.
 
As I stepped into the marshy area to get the wood I noticed that the plank I had walked across snapped and I was now on this small island surrounded by marshy mud. I had the firewood in my hands and I began to yell out for my group, but no sounds. It's about that time I noticed a figure race passed out of the corner of my eye. The figure had long black hair and was running faster than I could turn my head. Then the sound came from the other side and again I noticed the figure running behind me. I called out again for my group and realized that I would have walk through the marsh in order to get back. Before I could make a step forwards, however, I heard loud guttural breathing coming from behind me and the sound of the marsh being treaded through very slowly. I was frozen with fear and couldn't run and even worse had I ran I would have fell in the marsh most likely. It was when the breathing seemed to be just behind me that one of the group leaders peaked down through the trees and yelled my name. There was a loud crashing sound behind me and I turned around to see nothing. ",nosleep,trisight,/r/nosleep/comments/f3v7f/a_tale_from_my_childhood/

37,It was scary to me at the time,1295273661,"Around the time of this dream, I was 15 years old. I never drank or did drugs of any sort at that time.

It all started with me walking around the block I lived on. It was dark out, the street only lit by the dark yellow street lights. As I wandered, I started to feel as if something was following me. I became more and more conscious of whatever it was, to the point I began to jog. I made it a few hundred feet before hearing an awful laugh, cackling, and sinister. I looked behind me, and saw some sort of hybrid man / shark thing hide behind a car. (it's really hard to explain what it looked like, but it was scary shit) I ran faster, and the ""beast"" ran faster. There was no way I was going to escape it. 

Then out of nowhere, my older brother pulls around the corner in his 70's [Plymouth Duster](http://www.automotivehistoryonline.com/1970%20Plymouth%20Duster.jpg). (a car he hadn't had for years) He screams at me to get in, and I do. We peel out, and go past the creature. As we get farther away, nothing is left but the awful laugh in the background. The dream ends.

Fast forward to about 6 months later. I had good friends on the block I would chill with until late at night all the time. I had all but forgotten about the dream at this point. As I'm walking home around 2am, I hear that hideous laughter again. It sounded so real, I was convinced I could not have thought it up in my head. I ran home as fast I could, and never heard it again.

38,Exit 30,1295259504,"Exit 30 was always special marker on the trip to the summer home. It meant the two-hour drive from the city was just about over as we were now roughly 10 miles away from the secluded lake house. Also, exit 30 was the last semblance of humanity on our drive. Aside from a few farmhouses and oddly placed antique shops, that were house in 100-year-old farmhouses, there was nothing but farmland and forest.

My wife and I began our regular journey late one Friday evening, which meant that we would arrive to our destination close to midnight. The drive up was mundane, nothing out of the ordinary. We talked of plans for the summer, some personal issues, and joked about past times. The time past quickly with the good company and we suddenly found ourselves turning off at Exit 30. Due to our late arrival time the stores were closed, including the gas station, so we decided to pick up supplies in the morning.  

We took the right turn down exit 30, switched on our high beams, and started the last few miles of the trip. We passed a few roadside farm stands, the produce still sitting out as people used the honor system during the night, and we quickly approached a blinking stoplight that hung over an intersection.

The closer we got to the intersection, which had one of the aforementioned oddly placed antique stores, everything seemed to get brighter.  This wasn’t due to any store lights or streetlights… but the immediate night sky was filled with a warm, soft glow of a white light. Finally we arrive at the blinking stoplight to find the antique shop bathed in white light that had no discernible origin. Everything was just bright, and without warning the intense light began to envelop our car.

My wife and I sat in complete silence, looking at each other with a slight sense of panic, yet the cool spring breeze that gently pushed through the open car windows provided an eerie clam. Not a sound could be heard in or outside the car. Suddenly my wife grabbed my wrist and in the softest of voices said, “Look over there…” I didn’t have to ask where, I didn’t have to look around, I just knew.

I turned my gaze to the old building and saw what appeared to be little, stubby, beings. At first there was three but that quickly grew to roughly fifteen. These beings were roughly three to four feet high and, as in stereotypical “alien” fashion, they had huge black eyes… and this is where it got weird.

They were waving at us. Yes, they were waiving at us. Picture a person in a parade waving at you as their float went bye. This is EXACTLY what four of five of these beings were doing while the remainder seemed to aimlessly mill around. 

“What do you think they want?” I asked my wife. “They want us to go over there…”  I scoffed at the idea as the little visitors looked like they were part of some intergalactic welcoming committee but she reiterated, “They really want us to go to them… I can hear them. I can hear their thoughts in my mind.” She slowly reached to open the door to get out; however, fearing for our safety I floored the accelerator before the door could open… leaving our waving visitors and the white light fading into the distance behind us.

The remainder of the trip to our house was the most uncomfortable experience I have ever had. We both felt as if someone was watching us from the dark. The sensation was as if we could be taken or visited at any moment, but nothing ever came.  Nothing ever happened.

The next morning we decided it best to leave the house and return to the city. Our paranoid minds couldn’t let us enjoy our time on the lake, especially after our experience. On our way we stopped at the intersection looking for some explanation or sense of closure but nothing could be found.  

We did not return to our lake house that summer, and we spoke of the experience sparingly and with very few people. While the area in question is known for UFO sightings, to the best of my knowledge we are the only individuals to have the honor of actually seeing beings… and because of that Exit 30 will never hold the same meaning for me.

42,A dream from a while ago...,1295243767,"As I awoke, a **S**trange feeling washed over me, as though I was being watched by some unseen presence. My room, usually a uniform white and blue colour, was now abnormally green, the s**h**adows from the trees outside exaggerated and distorted to the point of being unrecognisable. For all I could tell, it was a warm summer morning, around 5 am to be precis**e**. There were no bird call**s**, nor the sound of wind through the open window. 

I suddenly flash to a dark room with two men peering at me from in the dark. They held Large knives and smiled menacingly.

The next thing I kno**w** I'm back in my room, closing my eyes to stop myself being blinded by the sun. 

Now instead of me being greeted by light when I open my eyes, I'm shocked to see two soulless eyes staring back at me through the window p**a**ne. The mess of a woman that met my stare was completely bloated, her skin blue and pink, with the bottom of her jaw missing and her **t**op lip removed. She was hanging lifeless from the tree outside my second story window by a rope around her neck. 

I turned around to run for my parents room, trying desperately to not remain with my ba**c**k to her for too long. Though she was clearly dead, I felt a massive air of malevolence surrounding her. 

When I arrived in my parents room I found them bot**h** dead, bloated in the same fashion, as if they had been there for a while. I tried frantically to wake them up, but there was no use. 

Around 2 minutes later the tree branch outs**i**de breaks and I hear a loud shriek, quickly followed by the sound of the kitchen door slamming shut. I panic as I hear a single set of footsteps making their way across the hardwood living room floor directly below me, slowly opening the door and **n**ow shuffling up the stairs, shuffling towards me. 

One foot step

*Keeeer-Schlunk* 

Two footsteps

*Keeeer-Schlunk*

I try to hide but the room suddenly turns a dark **g**rey. I panic through fear of what was to come next, knowing full well that if I was in a dream then the dream would normally end before I came to any harm. The footsteps continued faster up the stairs.

*Ker- Schlunk Ker-schlunk*

The door begins to creak open. 

The girl, around 5' 4”, now starts shuffling toward me while gasping and panting, her head twitching left to right. I realised that if I didn't do something I would be killed, so I turn to grab an object to fend her off with. 
I suddenl**y** flashed back to the two men standing over me, smiling and holding butcher knives. They grab me and I am instantly transported back to my parents r**o**om in the dream.

The girl had vanished, but she had left a trail of footprints leading into my bedroom and **u**nder my bed. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suffice to say, I didn't want to put my feet on the floor when I woke up that morning and I slept with the light on for a week. Though the images of the girl still haunt me to this day, they are made worse by my extremely bad phobia of dead bodies.

There is only one thing left in horror films that can cause me to cover my eyes and raise my heartbeat and that is a human corpse, this dream didn't help at all.

45,Found footsteps in the snow behind my house that don't belong to me or my wife.  Creepy neighbor (true story),1295236042,"First off, me and my wife are currently seperated.  Long story short, I had an emotional breakdown and caused a ruckus at our home (nothing violent towards her.  I was suicidal).  My wife called the police and everything was calmed down.  I'm fine now, seeing a therapist, going on dates with my wife, she's happy I'm lining up appointments......yadda yadda.  That's not the point of this post.

Ever Since Saturday the 8th I have been living at my parents house.  We had a snow storm all day Monday.  Earlier today (snow's still around) I go to pick up my wife for a date and she shows me these footprints in our backyard that she says aren't hers.  I investigate and conclude these foot prints are from someone that is as tall as me, or taller (I walked them and had to take quite a stride).  Also the prints were bigger than my feet (maybe a size 13/14 shoe).  

I also noted that these prints made an arching path and then stops and turns facing our back kitchen window.  At night me and the wife usually have our kitchen light on and the light goes into the yard a bit.  This arching path of footprints goes perfectly around where the light beam ends, and where this person stood was right outside of the light.  Sneaking around it seems.

When we go to bed we turn the kitchen light off.  These prints indicate someone was sneaking around the beam while the light was on and my wife was awake, and I was away.

Why I think it was a neighbor.

I am a night owl and a smoker.  Every night of the week you will usually see me in our front car port smoking cigarettes as late as 3am.  Well, any neighbor within viewing distance of our house definitely was aware that two police cars were parked at our house on Saturday, and then they probably saw that my car hasn't been there for a few days.  Someone that is pretty sure I won't be back for a while.


The prints showed up some time between Monday night thru Wednesday morning.  My wife's not sure.  This is troublesome to me because during this time most people weren't driving because of the heavy ice on the roads.  This is the southeast so when we get snow storms everything shuts down and NO ONE is driving anywhere.  These prints show up when there was no possible way I could just 'randomly' show up.

True, they could've been made from some wacky kid who's just messing around and walking into people's yards.  The troubling aspect is that the prints stop and face the kitchen.  I should add that our kitchen/dining room area is where me and my wife spend our evenings watching movies, internetting.  

I should also note that our backyard is fenced in.  Behind our back fence is just woods.  It's not one of those suburbs where backyards are connected and what not.  This is someone who walked up our driveway, opened the gate, walked perfectly around a light beam coming from our kitchen window, stood and watched as my wife did her evening routine and was definitely sure I wasn't coming home at that time.

What do you guys think?  Is this a creepy neighbor?

Btw, considering the stride of these foot steps and the shoe size I should add there is a tall overweight guy that lives diagonal from us that I would see on a nightly basis when I'm out smoking (he has odd night hours as well).  Several of my neighbors were probably aware of what went down with me last Saturday, and that I've been gone for a week.  He is the ONLY one that is big like that.

what do you guys think?

50,"Not sure if I posted this here before or not, thought you folks would like it: my dad's ghost sighting in the woods of southern Iowa.",1295218975,"This is my father's story. Let me preface this by saying my dad does not believe in ghosts and isn't one to make up stories.

Dad was scouting for deer hunting spots on private land in the Lake Rathbun area of southern Iowa. He had sought the farmers permission to hunt this area and was the only person with such permission. It was a bright, sunny afternoon in the fall and my dad had sat down on a tree stump in a small clearing to enjoy his lunch of cold KFC.

As he sat eating, he saw a man approach from the woods. The man was wearing old-time clothing: a wide brimmed, floppy felt hat, denim overalls, and knee-high boots. Dad couldn't get a good look at his face. The man passed by dad about 15 feet away. Dad called out to the man, ""do you have permission to be here?"" 

The man did not respond but simply kept walking. This made dad rather irate. Dad shouted, ""HEY! DO YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO BE HERE!?"" Still the man ignored him and continued walking away.

Now downright pissed off, dad chucked a drumstick at the guy in anger. ""I figured I missed him, the guy took no notice and the piece of chicken I threw landed in the grass near the trees. I got up and went after the guy."" recounted my father.


He caught up with the man just as he rounded a large tree. When dad got to the other side, the man was gone. Dad ran around to the other side of the tree, looked up, looked all over. The man was gone. Dad tells me, as he walked back to his lunch, be was thinking one thing: ""haha, holy shit. HOLY SHIT.""

And as he walked, crunching through the twigs and newly fallen leaves, he realized the man made no sound as he passed.

51,A comforting good bye,1295218080,"Growing up I was very close to my Grandmother's brother. I think this relation is considered a great-uncle, he was the youngest child in his family so he was about my parents age. I just referred to him as my uncle. He had always longed for a child but his wife had left him several years after being married and it left him unable to start any meaningful relationships. Needless to say we grew very close. 

I was always very excited to see him and would often spend the night at his house on the weekends, he was a chef so each visit he would teach me how to make some new and delicious dish. I remember we would always quarrel about the place settings, he would have me set the table and then always insist that I was doing it wrong regardless of how the places were set. 

We would stay up late and watch scary movies and drink hot chocolate. He would insist that I stay in the guest room when I would stay the night but I would always bring my blanket and pillow and sleep on his master bedroom floor. I only tried to sleep in the guest room once and suffered from a horrible nightmare. The dream was so chilling that I never wanted to be alone in that room again. 

I remember one night when I was about 12 we watched a ghost movie( I can't recall which one) and I asked him if he believed in ghosts. He was very religious (catholic) and he disclosed that he not only believed in ghosts but also that he had several encounters with them.

At this point I begged him to tell me what it was that he had experienced, he agreed only if I didn't tell my mother as he didn't want to be responsible for my nightmares. i eagerly agreed. He told me two very chilling stories, and of course I had complete faith in his testimony.

In both stories he was haunted by the specter  of his father. He insists that the day of his fathers funeral every room he entered smelt strongly of his father's cologne, this included the church, his mother's house, and his own bedroom. He said the strangest part was that when he entered his car with his sister they both smelled the cologne so strongly they were forced to open the windows on the way to the cemetery. He told me that he understood the entire time that it was his father letting him know that he was still around.

The second story was that of a recent dream, in the dream he saw his father and he told my uncle that he was to join him soon. That when this happened he should have no fear and simply follow the lit path that would be presented before him. He told him he was looking forward to their reunion. My uncle became very nervous after confiding that information and immediately regretted it. He told me he was sorry and shouldn't have told me that but he was very afraid that he was going to die soon. I became extremely frightened and suggest that we simply watch a comedy, he agreed and we didn't speak of that story the rest of my stay. 

The next night I returned home but couldn't stop thinking about my uncle's dream, right before bed my mother came in to my room and asked me if my uncle had given me any upsetting news while I was visiting. Staying loyal to my uncle I quickly answered in the negative. At this point my mother's eyes filled with tears and she told me that my uncle must have been too scared to tell me. I became extremely confused and waited patiently as my mother regained her disposition. She then revealed to me that my uncle had been diagnosed with cancer and was not expected to live much longer. I immediately told my mom of my uncle's dream, apparently he had already told her about it. She said that he had called her the night of the dream and received the news about his illness the following morning. At this point the validity of the experience was instantly confirmed.

The next few months were very sad for my entire family and I watched as my uncle fought for his life. Eventually I was asked to be a pall bearer. The day after the service my family gathered at my great grandmothers house to have a family dinner I was asked to set the table as my mother and grandmother prepared dinner. When finished I went in to the kitchen to help with the final preparations, as we all gathered at the table I quietly smiled when I noticed that everyone's forks were located to the left, except mine my place had been switched. To this day I know that I set all the places the same and that this was my Uncle's way of letting me know that he was still around. I just hope he never visits me in a dream to announce a reunion!",nosleep,buildabridgeoutofher,/r/nosleep/comments/f3go7/a_comforting_good_bye/
52,"On a Quiet Earth, You Scream Alone",1295214138,"I think it was after the President committed suicide that I knew everything would end.

Earlier I took a rather heavy dose of muscle relaxants and tranquilizers, managing to find a few hours of blessed rest before I sat down to type this, so I should be okay, at least for a little while.  Not that there will be anyone left to read this, but I can hope.

It all seemed so strange, that long, slow year ago, when everything was normal; or, as normal as you can expect.  There was the usual pain and misery, death and dismemberment, abuse and neglect, but that was nothing, nothing at all, compared to when it began.

As far as I can remember, and my memory at this point is faulty at best, they never found out what caused it.  The best theory going was that it was some kind of prion in the body that worked faster than most others, taking effect almost immediately and destroying the brain until the end.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Back when things were simple, I just had trouble sleeping.  My wife had trouble sleeping, too, and we made fun of it, the two insomniacs.  We didn't think much of it, since we both had stress from work, and we were trying to get pregnant.  She wanted a girl and I wanted a boy – carry on the family name and all that.

We finally did manage to sleep, catching five or six hours a night, which left us feeling tired, but not incapacitated.  I usually only needed seven to feel refreshed and ready to go, so this wasn't inconvenient.

This went on for weeks, without incident or question, until the cocktail party.  Publishing people are so often concerned with networking and business that they neglect to relax and have fun.  So our friends, Jared and Lizbeth (both from work, also married), decided to organize a small gathering of people from the office.

We dressed nicely and went to their East Side apartment, a spacious and well-decorated place, to wine and dine with our colleagues.  Idle chitchat turned slowly to our personal lives, and we learned that everyone else was dealing with insomnia.  Not just a few people, but everyone.  I remember that the room went very quiet, and then we decided that it was time to call it a night, even though it was only 7:30.

When Cheri (my wife) and I returned home, we began to call all our friends.  I don't remember most of the calls, except for one, with my brother.

“Tom,”  I said, “how are you?”

“Oh, y'know, the usual,”  he replied, yawning.

“I have something important to ask you,”  I said, “and you have to be honest.”

“Sure, what is it?”

“Are you having trouble sleeping?”

“Shit, yeah.  Past couple weeks, in fact, I haven't got much rest at all.  Why do you ask?”  I froze, and I wondered what was happening.  Terrorists?  Could it be terrorists?  But why, and what sense did that make?

“Tom, everyone has been having trouble sleeping.  Me, Cheri, the people I work with, everyone.”

“Well...maybe that's just a weird coincidence,”  he rationalized.

“I don't think so, I think something is wrong with us.”

And there was, there was something wrong.  It wasn't until the death toll, mostly from car accidents, began to rise dramatically that the mainstream news began to take notice.

I remember Anderson Cooper, dark shadows underneath his eyes, intonating to us through the teleevision that there was an epidemic of insomnia that had swept not just the United States, but the world.  I became used to seeing news anchors and interview subjects looking bleakly tired, their faces turning to a skeletal pain.

About five months in, we had been trying everything.  Every doctor, clinician, and research scientist on the planet was trying desperately to figure it out.  The irony, of course, was that the condition – which the news had dubbed the “waking death” - would sap mental acuity, as chronic insomnia would do to anyone, making it increasinlgy impossibnle to finish their work.

Then I came home from a run, trying to keep my mind sharp and active, to find that my wife had taken all of her sleeeping pills and tied a plastic bag over her head.  She didnt leave a note, just placed a pregnancy test on top of a sheeet of papr, with the blue plus-sign on it.  I don't pblame her.  I'm not even angrty.

The CDC annoounced that the disease, or whatever it waz, behaved almost identically to a very rare condition called Fatal Familial Insomnia, which was caused by a genetic marker defect and presented between the ages of 30 and 60 in most cases.  It was a horrrible way to die, or so Wikipedia told me.

First you begin with the sleeplesssness, turning into full-blown insomnia, which continues to get worse and worse.  This is followed by hallucinations, no doubt caused by having not sleptt for days on end.  With all this, you are no longer hungry, so your body turns to storage, causing a marked weight loss.  In the end, you barely even move, turning into some demented, occasionally babbling fool, descending further and further until death.

I vaguely recall that there was a doctor in Switzerland or the Netherlands or somewhere like that, and that he had discovered some chemical agent had combined in the clouds and spread the disease all over the world as the rains moved.  I don't remember why it was, or even how, just that it had happened and we had drunk ourselves into oblivion.  Apparently, our current water treatment processes were inadequate to filter all the prions from the supply, and so they worked their way throughout the world, one glass at a time.

I remember a newz chgannel showed a map of the worldf that was color-coded depending on where the symptoms first started.  Third-world countrys were the hardest hit, not having any filtering at all in most cases, and so they begggan the waking death firstz.

Sorry, I took a few more uppers.  I should be typing a little better now.

I buried her in the backyard, underneath her garden, where I think she would have wanted it to be.  Funeral homes couldn't handle the load anymore, so Congress had passed a law allowing burial of human remains on personal property.  I think the bill was called the Compassionate Family Burial Act.  Even in the midst of chaos, Congress has to be pedantic.

At eight months in, most businesses were failing, and it was just a matter of staying alive for as long as possible.  There were many reports of police having just lost their minds, patrolling the streets with their guns out, killing anyone they passed.  Television and cable networks went off the air (except for occasional, useless emergency messages), and the backbone structure of the internet – no longer having anyone to maintain it – collapsed.  The power companies slowly went offline, and gasoling prices hit $15 a gallon before the marketplace finally dried up.  If you wanted to go somewhere, you had to walk or ride a bike.

I was one of the lucky ones, as we were in an area that got hit with it last.  Well, lucky depends on how you look at it, I suppose.  I’m one of the last to survive, but I got to see friends and family descend into madness and dementia until they died.  Then it was just me and a few others, aimlessly wandering the streets, listening to the breeze and the birds.  I saw someone sunntainning in the middle of the road, either hoping that a car wouldn't come, or not caring if one did.
Out of uppers.  Shit.

53,My aunt told me some interesting stories after my grandmother died.,1295211245,"My aunt told me some interesting stories after my grandmother died.

One of my aunts drove to my grandparents house to meet with my grandfather. My grandmother was already dead at the time and was not in the house, my aunt never saw her during her visit. However, she decided to drive back home pretty late and she was very tired at the time. She said that for the entire drive home, my grandmother was sitting in her passenger seat. They talked just for a little while, but for the most part both of them stayed quiet.

My aunt asked my grand mother why did she have to go? My grand mother replied, I wasn't ready, I didn't want to die. She said my grand mother told her she wanted to be in the car with her so she did not fall asleep. When my aunt told someone in my family about her ride home, they didn't believe her. She then described what my grand mother was wearing during the car ride, it was the dress she died in.

My grand father has since sold the house and moved away. My aunt recently visited the house and it's new owner. The owner told her that she see's an older women sometimes in the house. Short, a bit overweight, curly hair. She also told my aunt that sometimes my grandmother turns on the kitchen lights. Sometimes when she is trying to sleep, she feels the blankets being pulled over her, like being tucked in. I grew up living with my grandmother as a child, she tucked me in all the time.

I've thought about driving to this house myself, but don't have the time or the money to do so (it would be a drive from Los Angeles to Killeen Texas). 

If you knew that a member of your immediate family was.. haunting? a house, would you take the time to go back to that house and attempt to communicate with it?

55,Slender Man - The power of human belief,1295198136,"First off this is a throw-away account (surprise, right? With a username like ""throwawayaccountplea"" where ""please"" was cut off). The other night I stumbled across a story somebody told in this subreddit about a window being thumped on with a screen outside that made it impossible for the knock to have come from anywhere but inside the room (something like the 6th floor, too). I'm new to this sub, so I've been reading pretty much everything. Anyway, someone posted a response that suggested the culprit was a thing called Slender Man. I had no clue what that was, so I took the mention of Marble Hornets and went with it.

Knowing full well I'm highly sensitive to such things I still went and looked it up. I googled Marble Hornets and watched all 32 videos. The fact that the most recent was posted just a couple days ago and that the first was a year or so ago made it seem strangely real to me. Now, I've already read about where the Slender Man idea came from - the Something Awful forums - and read everything I could find that confirmed Slender Man is a hoax, but I can't get it out of my head. The images are seriously fucking with my brain. I'm losing actual sleep over this, and I'm not sure why. Slender Man is, honestly, one of the sillier spectres somebody could have thought up. A body in a MiB suit with long spidly arms, moving at molasses in January speed everywhere he goes? Shouldn't be that terrifying.

Yet, it really is. Ever since I watched the videos, knowing ahead of time it was a hoax, I've felt eyes on me everywhere I go. I live very rural and the house is ringed with large fully lengthed windows that look out into the woods on three sides, and over a tiny, sleepy ""village"" sized town on the other. I see the figure down the street out the front windows, on the second floor in the skylight, standing just out of the porch light in the woods, just fucking standing there. I have a very overactive imagination and I'll admit that readily, but I can't help feeling like I'm not imagining any of it. The sheer intensity of the fear is unprecedented. My SO finds the whole thing hilarious. I really don't.

Is it possible that if enough people believe in something, as in the Tulpa of Tibetan Buddhism, the intensity of that belief could create whatever it is that's being believed in? Does anyone else think this could be so? Or am I seriously just going totally batshit seeing this thing everywhere? I wouldn't doubt it, as again, I have a truly overactive imagination, but I'm getting the shits put right up me. 

UPDATE: Things are getting worse, rather than better. There's been a series of what I sincerely hope are coincidences that have served to really feed this whole affair. First off, I'm a smoker and I go outside to smoke. I like cigs but I hate the residual smell, so there you have it. There's a porch light on the back of the house. Maybe a week or so ago that lightbulb was changed. It didn't blow out or anything, we just changed it because it been awhile and being out there in the dark is not exactly enjoyable. Total black, woods all around. Last night I was out there having a smoke when the light started dimming. Not even flickering, just dimming. It got to the point that it was all but failing to light the area around itself, then went completely out for all of a second or two. Then, it came back on. That happened two times before I put out the cigarette and went inside. Next on the list of coincidences, I'd settled into my computer with two family members in the room with me, downstairs. The entire house shook. I don't mean a brisk wind came through and made the windows shake, I mean the entire house rumbled and shook for about three seconds, then stopped. Both family members remarked upon it before I did, so it's not my imagination. I live in Northern California, so earthquakes aren't uncommon, but I haven't seen anything about it on the news this morning. It's entirely possible that it was an earthquake, regardless. Lastly, this morning I'm wandering around with a cup of coffee trying to wake up. I walked out of the laundry room from the garage (another cig break) and in my wake, shit is falling off the walls. We have things like a drill, a step stool, etc., mounted on the walls to keep from cluttering up the garage. It's plausible that the house shaking last night unsettled some of the items, but several of them? All at the same time after being fine all night until I walked by?

56,There Is No Ghost In This Story,1295197897,"A few years ago I worked part-time at a large hotel. I mostly worked front desk but at times was asked to be the ""runner"". If I was scheduled for morning shift runner then I had to bring things up like towels to guests' room, if there weren't enough housekeepers, or shuttling guests around in the van. 

One night, I happened to be assigned the p.m. runner shift, and one of the duties was to slip envelopes under the door of the people who opted for express check-out in the morning. For some reason they didn't want you to do it while the guests were awake, so I had to go around at 2 o'clock in the morning.

At the time of the incident the hotel was not busy, but there were a number of envelopes to be delivered. In the middle of delivering the check-out slips, through silent, endless hallways, I heard footsteps running ahead of me, just around a corner. ""Great, there's going to be some dumb twin girls, in dresses, and evil smiles, staring at me when I go around the bend"" was my not-so-funny joke to myself. 

No, not little girls. It was a little boy. He was running down the hallway, but there was something a little odd about him. Even in the well-lit hallway, I couldn't make him out too well, he seemed blurry, and he was only about 20 feet from me. He was wearing a red shirt and a diaper, his chubby little legs pumping on the floor, the diaper sagging a little. Then he stopped at a door and turned, waved at me, then went through it. I stood there, wondering if I just saw someone go through a solid door, or if there was a little gap and he sneaked through. I didn't hear the door lock catch, and I would have seen the handle move but I didn't. I passed the door cautiously but it looked closed and there was no noise from within. 

When I got back to the desk, I looked up the room number, and saw that there was a family in there, with a little boy. ""Whew, just a kid running around at two in the morning. Nothing to see here folks."" Then my shift was over and I went home. 

The next night, I was working again. When I got to work there was a hubbub. Apparently, some time after breakfast, that little boy had had a seizure and died. What was it I saw? Was it just a coincidence?",nosleep,Reintarnation,/r/nosleep/comments/f3bpr/there_is_no_ghost_in_this_story/

58,This might be a bit sobering,1295190437,"I spoke to a friend of mine I had not seen in a while, she had moved away (only the next town over) with her Father once he had retired, but I had rarely seen her for about 10 years, only meeting her at mutual friends weddings and funerals, the occasional new years eve party, we didn't keep much in touch.

I had to go to town one day for a meeting in Wetherspoons, so I made the most of my time in the town and went for a haircut first before walking down to the pub.

I'd probably drink at any time of the day when in a pub that early in the day, but because I was meeting some business I ordered a coffee, who should be the bar maid but the girl I once knew as a kid.

We recognised each other and she came round the bar to give me a hug and kiss, there was really no reason why we had not spoken for a while so it was good to see her.

I asked how her father was as we used to play snooker in the local club together sometimes when they lived nearby, he was an old physics teacher who had stumbled upon a technique for doing something that had been worth some money, enough for him to retire when he sold the patents.

She told me he was in good health generally, but he was starting to lose his mind. The guy would be in his late seventies.

I thought back to the times we had played pool and he was one of the sharpest people I knew, so I was shocked by her news.

She told me he now speaks in a womans voice, or makes monkey noises sometimes when they talk. She had to sell the house he and his wife lived in to pay for the care.

It was then I remembered the story, once the house had been sold there was a piece in the paper about the new owner discovering an exquisite parquet floor under the carpet in the living room, and in the conservatory when the carpet was lifted they found satanic symbols etched into the stone, risen with human blood.

It was unlike anything that had ever occurred to me before - I had been scared, I had thought that I had had a terrifying dream and I had even crept into my mothers bed to sleep. But I was wrong. Those times were nothing compared to that night when I finally dreamt the unthinkable and lied awake in my bed, paralyzed until morning. The sheer suggestiveness of what I had seen was, above all, horrific. But the thing that bothered me most was that it was so simple and so strange.

It was a windowsill. Or was it? Hanging there in some abyss, a gateway to a realm of black. Blacker than black. A realm of nothingness. I would think that I caught glimpses of the realm and that it held other images within its boundless grasp, but I was too distracted. Far too distracted by the curtains.

They were simple, a pale blueish white, and transparent, like they were made from gas. 

They fluttered. Something made them billow and distort, but it was not wind. They moved not with purpose, but with the iron will of something that yearns to be, but cannot. Their motions instilled a terror so deep in me, it was like a hand was clasping my heart. Yet still, I did not wake. For while the curtains had my undivided attention, I simply could not focus on them. I could not make them out - yet I could at the same time. It was confusing, overwhelming.

But as I watched, I began to discern sense from the madness. There was no windowsill. They were not curtains. It was a cloak, draped around a hooded figure. Her back was to me - the infernal billowing of her gossamer cloak would never leave my gaze. And she just stood there, in nothingness. 

She would never look at me. She would never smile at me, love me or wave at me. She always stood there, with her back to me, unmoving, while her infernal nothing-cloak swayed tauntingly in front of me.

I do not know how long I was asleep, watching her back. Time has no meaning in the land of dreams. But when I woke, I was not sweating, I was not crying and I certainly wasn't screaming. No, I just lay there, frozen, staring straight up at the ceiling. I refused to move my head, so utterly terrified that I may catch a glimpse of the window in my room, that I might see the same strange vista. The ceiling was my only refuge, closing my eyes was no option. What if I closed them and beheld Her horrid visage again?

My mother never returned from her overseas business trip. My dream did not comfort me in anyway, it only instilled the fear of death in my youth for the very first time. Why did she hate me?",nosleep,totallyjawsome,/r/nosleep/comments/f39e9/my_first_nightmare_as_a_child/
61,"A true story from my past, you decide if it's coincidence or not.",1295173045,"Just to clear up to start with, I'm a huge skeptic and I still don't believe any of this is real, but it's very coincidental and some of you might enjoy the story that the rest of my family pretty much takes for granted as true.

My grandmother moved into a house in a town south of Perth in Australia called Mandurah. It's a medium sized town now. The house was on the outskirts and backed onto farmland. So it was pretty quiet out there. 

She lived there with another guy who was in his 60s who had been living there for a few years before she moved in. I used to visit the house a couple of times a year as a kid, as did my sister, mother and father. Every time we visited however, both my dad and I would get violently ill. I recall being delirious, feverish and feeling an overall sense of dread whenever I stayed there. 

Sometimes we could stay a week without getting sick, but eventually we'd come down with something. The odd part about the sickness was that my mother, sister and grandmother NEVER got sick. The guy who lived there was pretty much dosed up on medication all the time so I don't know if he ever felt as awful as we did.

I stopped visiting the house from about the point I turned 13, as did the rest of my family. The guy who lived there eventually died from a stroke, and my grandmother moved out of the house and in with another friend so she wouldn't be alone.

Now, this is the part that sort of freaks me out, even as a skeptic. A few years ago, I talked to my sister about how dad and I always used to get sick there, she told me something my grandmother had told her.

Before my grandmother or the other guy had moved into the house, a woman had died there from old age. She apparently just fell down in the kitchen and wasn't found for a while. From what my sister was told, this lady hated men. Something must've happened in her life that just made her despise the male gender, but while she was there, male neighbours were screamed at to get away if they tried to talk to her, so eventually everyone just gave up trying at all.

I have no proof, of course. But I find it spooky that only my dad and I would ever get sick at that house, and none of the women ever did. The symptoms were always the same. Hot and cold flushes, a feeling like one second my body was 1 inch tall and weighed 1000 tonnes, followed by the feeling that I was a giant who could float away. It was very disorienting and I always felt dread. My dad felt the same way.

Now here's the kicker. My sister recalls waking up in the middle of the night sometimes while staying there and seeing the silhouette of a woman standing in the doorway to her room. She said she never felt afraid, but felt peaceful and always immediately went back to sleep. Talking to my mum and grandmother after confirmed that they both had also had visits from the woman silhouetted in the doorway, and similar feelings of peace and comfort.

Even right now, I can't completely push this out of my mind as coincidence. Is it possible that the lady who died in the house was haunting the men who stayed there, making them feel sick and full of dread? Could she have been protecting the women who stayed there, making them feel comfortable and at peace?

63,I lost some sleep once...,1295165178,"About 12 years ago I had a particularly chilling experience one evening. I would like to preface by saying that I was at the time no stranger to the ""heebie-jeebies"". I had been creeped out of many a basement, had felt that odd breeze that just seemed wrong, and had seen my dog respond to things that did not seem perceivable to humans. This night was much different.

My wife and I are usually night-owls, but that night we had gone to bed around 11:30. Most nights we stay up chatting, but on this particular night my wife fell asleep right away. I lied there only a short time when my experience began. Across the room, past my footboard, I saw a light hanging in the air. The only other lights in the room were the alarm clock on the night stand, and a boombox on the floor with a tiny red light. This was on the other side of the room. I reached over to wake my wife up, but she was sound asleep. I propped up a bit to get a better look. The light hung about 5 or 6 feet in the air, and it was soft and blue. As I looked closer, it began to appear as if it was light from the window hitting a face. I nearly shot out of bed, but I could clearly see all around the light, and there was no body. But this light was beginning to clearly resemble a face. I tried again to wake my wife, quietly saying her name while shaking her shoulder. She eerily would not wake up, though it seemed like my effort should have been sufficient. I began to suspect that I had lost my mind, or was dreaming and my wife might take a demon form and attack me, but she never woke up for the duration of what occurred. 

So I stared at the light for a moment as it swayed in the air, when in my peripheral vision more lights began to appear. Soft, semi-transparent green, blue, pink, yellow and white lights. Within a matter of moments, not only had the one light appeared and begun taking the shape of a face, but the other lights had also begun to do the same. As I watched, the lights all grew slowly, and took the shape of not only faint faces, but also fainter bodies. There was no facial detail, so I could not make out any expressions. I was terrified, but more paralyzed than that. I very slowly slumped down my headboard and was almost completely prone again. I tried to close my eyes, but after just a second I saw the lights begin to fade in... through my closed eyelids. I desperately wanted to wake up from a dream, or open my eyes to see nothing, but the lights continued to swell and had begun to take the shape of faces again. My next thought was that if these lights could appear to my eyes despite the fact they were closed, I would somehow lose this battle if it took place in my subconscious. I opened my eyes, and the lights appeared just as they were. So I just stayed still and watched these apparitions that surrounded my bed for a about 20 minutes it seemed, too afraid to move, and horrified of what might happen if I close my eyes again. Slowly the lights faded away. When it was over I was exhausted, but still did not sleep for a few more hours at least, and was still too afraid to get up and walk through the room. I never counted, but at the peak there were probably over 20 figures in the room. And still, despite modest efforts my wife would not seem to wake up. I never screamed her name or shook her roughly, but I was afraid of what would happen if she did wake as well, so I didn't force the issue.

It was a completely isolated experience. I have spent many, many hours contemplating this and never come up with a sound explanation. And, for what it is worth, I swear I was awake, sober, and lucid for the whole experience, and every detail I described is true.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f36y9/i_lost_some_sleep_once/

I wonder what daddy is going to get me. Maybe it's a dollhouse. My bed is not that comfy today. I had a dream. It was such a good dream. In it I was with my mommy. I miss my mommy. We played together all day and at night she would sleep next to me, singing lullabys and telling me stories. My room smells funny. And me and mommy ate whatever we wanted whenever we wanted. Even if we wern't hungry. I even got to eat ice cream for dinner! I can't wait to tell daddy. I know he misses mommy too. He has been really sad ever since mommy went away. I can't wait to tell him about my dream! It's going to make him smile. I like it when daddy smiles. I call out for daddy. I hope he hears me. I am scared to walk to his room at night. Monsters. Daddy says monsters aren't real. It's people I need to be afraid of. Daddy says the only kind of monsters are the kind that took mommy away from us. I hear a noise. Far away. It's scary. It sounds like it's getting closer and louder. It's coming from the attic. I hold my teddy tight. I yell for my daddy again. My dream, think of my dream. I asked mommy when daddy was going to come be with us so we can be together again. She looked sad, but then she smiled and said soon. But then my dream got scary. Something pulled me away from mommy. I was screaming and screaming and mommy tried to grab me but I slipped from her and fell fell fell. Then I woke up. Now I hear a loud banging comming from the attic. DADDY! DADDY!

Malarone is a malaria med that I had to take for six weeks in order to go to Honduras for one week. It gave me plenty of nightmares, but this one stood out the most.

I am floating in space. I have no body so I can't move or speak. Rather than stars, planets, and blackness, I am surrounded by a swirling black and navy blue vortex and all around me I can hear distorted vortex sounds, as if something is sucking in air.

All of a sudden, I see a woman in front of me. She is fair with brown hair and looks to be in her early twenties. She is frowning and whispering ""help me"" as if it hurts to speak above a whisper and she is trying her hardest to speak around the pain. In front of her a baby is floating and an umbilical cord is stretching from the baby's belly to the woman's.

As I watch, the area around the umbilical cord on the woman's belly starts to swell. The skin cracks and underneath I can see a pulsing red growth. The swelling takes up her whole stomach. She starts crying. I look back to the baby. Its eyes dissolve into its head and what looks like ink starts spilling from its empty eye sockets.

Let me elaborate. I live in the Basement of an Old house on a Hill in the Middle of the Woods. All your classic stuff in one place. For the past week it's been building up; mistaking common noises for freaky new sounds, seeing my cat/dog in the dark thinking it's a demon, not being able to sleep until daylight, etc etc.

Well this morning was the breaking point. With all these stories I've started living them out in my dreams and there was one story that really got me..it was the one with the creature killing the kids parents and writing on the wall ""I know you're awake."" Well my dad came in my room this morning at 7:30 after me finally getting to bed around 5 and I was just barely conscious of the real world around me. His outline and shadow immediately became the creature and I woke up screaming. Like screaming bloody murder. I couldn't stop myself. My body froze up and I just kept screaming for about five minutes until my mind registered I was ok.

76,The Wrong Room,1295084594,"This is the reason I believe in ghosts. It happened about ten years ago. It didn't seem so upsetting at the time, but knowing what it's possible to see has certainly stained my experiences since. 

I was 17, staying with friends of my mother's in Connecticut. This couple lived in a spacious three-story house nestled on the edge of a wooded property. Some time before we knew them, the woman had brought her mother out from another country to stay, where she had developed cancer and passed away. They often talked about ""Mum"". We knew anecdotes about Mum, about her idiosyncrasies, that she was cremated and where her ashes where scattered- a lot of details. I wasn't at first told much about her illness, but I knew she died at home, in the same house I was staying in. This made me nervous, as I've always been somewhat antsy around death- the result of a childhood experience I might relate another time. I was relieved when I found out which room was hers, as I could then actively avoid that room. Luckily, it was upstairs and a bit out of the way, so it was easily ignored. 


The room I stayed in was downstairs, behind the living room and next to the bathroom. It was filled with storage boxes except for a path to and surrounding the bed, and a rocking chair between the bed and the door. It was a comfortable room to me because of all the boxes. It felt like a nest you could retreat in to, with the bed in the middle with the big heavy comforter to snuggle into, especially in the winter- it was January when this happened. 


Late one night (I was and continue to be a *serious* night owl), about two in the morning, I was snuggled halfway under these covers. I had just taken a shower, and was now sitting up in bed sketching. The door to this room would swell whenever one took a shower, as it was so close to the bathroom. It was hard enough opening the door to get into the room, then forcing it shut behind me. I heard a rustling behind the door as I sat in bed and assumed it was one of my hosts trying to come in, but struggling with the door. I called out ""Hello?"" as I watched the door. I saw the doorknob turn around and back, then again, and then it rattled urgently. I called out again ""Hello?"" The rattling stopped. 


The rocking chair next to the bed began to rock violently, very fast. I watched, stunned, for perhaps half a minute. I couldn't think of a rational thing could make the chair move like that. There was no shaking of the house, nothing that could have pushed it or for that matter continued to push it. Shakily, I put out a hand and grabbed the arm of the chair. It jerked to a stop, and when I let go it remained stopped. I don't know how or if I slept that night. 


A few nights later my hosts where preparing dinner around 7pm. I went into the bedroom to change my clothes, and was standing at the foot of the bed facing the window with a completely black night beyond. I bent down to pull up my pants and when I looked up again, there was an old woman standing, it seemed, just outside the window, looking at me. It was not just an old woman. Every detail of her face, hair, clothes- everything was lined in a white light. She appeared to be glowing. She looked straight at me with a completely blank expression, then turned and disappeared beyond the edge of the window frame. 


Much later, visiting the couple- no longer staying with them, the female host got a bit tipsy. She began to expound upon her opinion of assisted suicide laws in America. She let slip two details I had not previously known. First, that Mum had moved to the downstairs guest room toward the end of her illness so she didn't have to climb the stairs anymore, and second that she had not actually died of cancer. In fact, her daughter had administered an overdose of morphine to her, and held a pillow over her face, just to be sure. She had died in the room I stayed in, in the bed I stayed in, after all. 

I don't know what to make of the whole thing now. Was Mum not as ready to pass on as her daughter thought she was? Was Mum upset that someone was sleeping in her bed? All I do know is I saw something extraordinary, and I live dreading the thought of seeing something like it again. ",nosleep,this_isnt_happening,/r/nosleep/comments/f2qvv/the_wrong_room/
77,The Bell Witch Cave,1295078155,"This happened to me while I was in college.  I went to college in Kentucky, only about an hour away from Adams, Tennessee, where the Bell Witch Cave is located. Adams is a tiny one-stoplight town that you might miss if you blink.

If you don't know what the Bell Witch Cave is, either read the Wikipedia article on it or watch the movie ""An American Haunting.""

I had a boss in the student library where I worked that told me you couldn't pay him enough money to go back there, and the ghost was able to whisper something to his girlfriend that only she knew. He also warned me not to ""challenge"" the ghost. Anyway, me and two friends decided to jump into my old Dodge Dynasty and head down there on Halloween night for a tour. We got there just in time for the last tour of the night at midnight.

While on the tour, we went past some old ""Indian remains"" and a little deeper into the cave where some water was running. The farthest they'll usually take you is a formation called Eagle Rock. I stuck my head past the rock, and I could have sworn some greenish light flashed from the back of the cave towards me. It made me shake my head a couple of times.

We got ready to leave the cave, and of course, as a half-joke, I called out ""Kate, show yourself!"" Immediately I heard something whisper, but I couldn't make out the words. I dismissed it as hearing other tour goers talking in the distance.

My friends and I started back towards my car. It was about 50 degrees out, so a rather cool fall night. As we came up the hill we suddenly hit a spot of extremely warm air rising from the ground, at I'd estimate 75 degrees or more. It smelled strange too, like flint. We explained it away as likely some hot water from the cave running close to the surface there, but it still seemed odd.

As we got closer to the grass parking lot, we heard the family's dog barking incessantly at something. We finally saw my car, and then we saw the dog bolt from the car with its tail between its legs. I joked that it was barking at the ghost haunting my car.

We got in the car and started it up, and headed back towards the highway. Strange things started to happen. The heat was on full blast but the interior of the car would not warm up. Both my friends and I commented it felt like something was trying to make us cry, or our eyes water up. The windows all fogged up, and as we passed an exit and some lights, we noticed a backwards ""K"" and a handprint embossed in the fog--on the outside of the window! By the next exit a P had formed on the window's outside. During the tour we had been told the ghost had been known as ""Kate"" or ""Pele.""

Things didn't really quiet down until we got to the Kentucky border, and the heat finally started working, and the fog disappeared from the windows. Sometimes even now, I feel the pull of the ghost of the Bell Witch Cave, asking me to return...I don't know what would happen if I did. I'm getting chills just writing this.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f2pyp/the_bell_witch_cave/

					   INTRODUCTION:

He awoke to the alarm going off…the chief was shaking him.  “Jesus Christ, again?”  He was not happy.  “Hurry up!” the Chief said “We’ve got another emergency.”  Damn it all…it happened again.   The sixth time in four hours.  The response time was important, he knew that. Six times in four hours though?  This was quickly getting out of hand.  He rose up quickly and slid down the pole to the first floor, opening up his locker, he took the essentials.  Winchester 1300, check, fire axe, check, machete’, check. He decided to take his sidearm too, although it never did much good…45 ammo was rare nowadays, and it was hard to get a headshot at one-hundred yards anyway, but it was precautionary- after all..the leather jacket and chainmail were more important. Whatever kept you from being bitten.
The 105th Zombie Defense Squadron, or   “Headshot- Squad”   as they were affectionately known, had yet another call.  The outbreak had been bad for years, but it was getting increasingly worse. They seemed to be learning, and increasing in numbers.  They were faster and more self-aware since two years ago, and were becoming more aggressive.  They had also learned to attack in groups.  The dead mind becoming more aware, strategizing.  “What a joke.”   He thought to himself. He climbed into the AAV, still groggy from lack of sleep.  Not a good thing. With any luck they could disperse the things with the fifty cal anyway, and with even more luck, he wouldn’t even have to leave the protection of the Armored Assault Vehicle.  
As an afterthought, he grabbed the electric nail gun, and a few sonic pipe-bombs.  Nails were the easiest ammo to come by these days, and as always, a headshot was a headshot, no matter how you got it.  He put on his Kevlar helmet, and entered the AAV, ready for war. Strapped or screwed, he always said.
It all began ten years ago, April ninth, twenty twelve.  It was supposed to be the end of days, and it was, sort of.   The flu virus manifested itself in a whole new way.  It started with mad cow disease, then SARS, then swine flu, or H1-N1..which was dismissed as a “Non-Fatal world epidemic”.  That grew into the Lazarus Virus, or H2-N2. We started to see reanimation after death, and worse, the common house fly,    “Family Muscidae”  and its larvae, carried the Lazarus Virus to numerous hosts, including those already in the ground. Unfortunately, this disease was able to spread quickly, as House fly eggs are laid in almost any warm, moist material that will supply suitable food for the larvae. The female begins laying eggs a few days after hatching, laying a total of five to six batches of 75 to 100 eggs. In warm weather, eggs hatch in 12 to 24 hours. You can see the problem with a carrier like that I’m sure. It wasn’t a problem at first, but basic instinct took over, and as these reanimated dumb, slow skin-jobs, did just that, mated, the virus grew.  A new strain of the “Lazarus Virus” was born.  They weren’t slow and stupid anymore, they were self aware. With the new strain came speed, and thought processes we weren’t aware these reanimated corpses could possess.  They thought they were alive again. They wanted one thing, life.  This meant harvesting new cells.  Stem cells they could only get from the living.  Us.
It soon became a Pandemic.  At first we experienced “Cells” of these diseased living corpses.  They were isolated in certain areas.  The lower-class poor and homeless areas were infested  quickly, they had no means of hiding, or defending themselves.  Easy prey.  To be honest, this was dismissed, at first, as natural selection by our wonderful upper-class whites. It wasn’t their problem, they after all had money.  That was all good and well until the Cells started to infest the wealthy areas.  Suddenly the rich, who relied on everyone else, I.E. the poor servants they employed, had no one to rely on,  the servants saved themselves, leaving the masters unattended and helpless. NOW it was a recognized problem for all people.  Then came H3-N3.
When they were slow, H2-N2  subjects  were easy to dispatch, slow and clumsy..a shot to the head from anything would do, and you had time to do it.  The new H3-N3 strain, however, changed the game.  Now they were fast, and calculating, and strong, and that strength was in numbers.

	
	
Chapter 1: The Kill

Dante Cameron, or as his friends called him, “Inferno” was at the top of his game. A soldier in the Zed-Unit, he was one of the most decorated.  With over 150 headshots, he was nominated as a “Dead-Eye”, unfortunately  that also meant, wanted on ALL missions”.  The outbreaks were more frequent lately, and the sleepless nights were definitely getting old.  Dante was however one of the lucky few.  Most of the civilian population had died out in his area,  before the virus spread, so there were less zed to deal with in the first place.

This movie will be in 5D where the viewer is actually inside the movie watching the characters sit in the movie theatre, watching the movie. Its a ground breaking idea that I've been working on. In case you were wondering the pivotal scene in the movie is when I, the protagonist and antagonist both, climb mount Everest with no oxygen tank while on stilts. Once I get to the summit I donkey punch the deaf mute baby horse off the mountain and the movie screen explodes. THE END. 

or is it...? ITS NOT. When the audience drives home after the movie that night they will open the door to their home only to find the movie playing on every one of the tv's in their house. How is this possible? How does the earth keep turning? Nobody knows. EXACTLY. 

They will unplug all of their tv's only to find that the movie does not stop playing. Then they get a phone call saying that if they don't go back to see my movie at least 2 more times they will die in seven days. (Kind of like the Ring only I'm out for highest grossing picture of the year not revenge like that dirty skank.) 

Once my movie becomes famous and the world sees me as a threat to their freedom I'll pick a scapegoat that most people don't like, say...indian food. Notice that I didn't say Indian people. That's because scapegoating races is cliche and I'm way beyond that. Anyways...I'll blame all of the world's problems on Indian food. ""it gives you diarreah"" will be the platform of my campaign. My party name you ask? ""Nutzacks of America."" Once I gain enough followers I'll probably have a kool aid party because everyone likes koolaid. (no one will die) By this time I will have gotten major world leaders like Kim Jong ill and other douche bag commie leaders attention. I'll tell them I wana alliance and to meet me for dinner at olive garden because they have never ending breadsticks. We'll laugh and talk about how dumb all the stuff that is secretly awesome to me (see where I'm going with this?) 

After everyone finishes their salads I'll say something to the effect of...""boy what a great meal kim jong..but there is only room for one world leader in this world.""

and he will have no idea what i said until my translator says
""대단한 식사 김 영은 ..하지만이 세 Mitsubishi 하나의 세계 honda 선두 전용 공간이 소년""

and before he can even say anything back he will be face down in his salad. all the other world leaders will be dead too. they will have died of natural causes (too many breadsticks) 

At this point everyone (including america) pretty much loves me for getting rid of these douchebags and I'll prolly politely ask obama to let me be pres and he'll be like ""but I won a nobel peace prize"" and i'll be like ""i woke up this morning too, do i get one?"" in front of everyone and he'll be like shit and he'll let me be president THE END. 

oh and btw that was still the movie. ya that whole thing.

The film will be banned in every country in the world except for North Korea due to its Xyklon B rating.

80,Sketches,1295058827,"First off, I hate this story and try not to think about it.  I’ve been considering posting it for awhile because I love reading  nosleep, but since the person it’s about would know exactly who I am if they read this, I have been worried.  But now I figure what are the odds that he reads this subreddit.  I’ll use fake names, anyway.  

In high school, there was this guy, Noah.  He was one of several loner/weirdos at the school.  He mostly wore black, his wide leg pants were never long enough (kinda did the funny looking highwater thing), and his hair was always a little greasy.  He stayed out of everyone’s way, always sat in the back of class, never participated, got bad grades I think, and was constantly doodling and drawing stuff (but very secretive about it, you know blocking anyone from seeing with his forearm if they tried to look over).  I had moved to the area for highschool, but the majority of other kids there had all gone to elementary school or middle school with each other.  I was kind of pretty, not very popular, but I had my little gaggle of friends. 

One day in history class (during my junior year) I came in a little early and set my stuff down.  There were about 7 or 8 other kids in the room and Noah was in the back, sketching as usual.  I barely ever noticed him or gave him a second thought.  My history teacher handed me a stack of papers and asked if I could just pass them out or put one on each desk before class starts because we had a lot to cover that day.  I guess I was really quiet passing them out because when I got right in front of Noah to give him his, he looked up with a jolt and his arm flailed off his desk, brushing his drawing off.  Ohhhh holy shit, guys.  I went to pick it up for him since I was standing right there and felt bad for startling him, and he scrambled out of his chair sideways to intercept it.  It was a girl, slightly scantily-clad.  It was me.  I only saw it for two seconds but there was no mistaking it: my nose, my hair, my eyes, jawline, everything.  To top it off, I looked scared (or maybe supplicating is the right word?).  What the hell, I never even noticed him looking at me before, there was certainly nothing special about me.  I pretended not to see it and turned and walked away quickly, but my heart was racing.  What kind of fucked up shit is that?      

Of course, I immediately told my two closest friends after class, Shelley and Karen.   I mean, it was great gossip, they were cracking up.  When they calmed down they told me he did the exact same thing to a girl in 8th grade.  He was only slightly less secretive then and one of his few guy friends had seen them, taken some, and told the girl about it.  He had like 10 drawings of this poor girl and she flipped out when Noah’s friend showed some of them to her.  She was really upset and Noah had to go to the counselor’s office and I think her parents got involved.  I’m sure Shelley was embellishing the story a little, but other people we talked to confirmed this incident.  They said he hadn’t been drawing her naked, but whatever he’d drawn her doing really disturbed her, and she wouldn’t talk to anyone about it.   

Shelley and Karen (and me, I admit) weren’t going to let this rest, scandals are just so fun in high school.  A few days later, we find out that a guy named Bill on Karen’s boyfriend’s football team was Noah’s locker partner.  Bill didn’t like interacting with, or having his stuff near Noah, so he kept all his stuff in the gym locker, or just carried it in his backpack.  After searching a bit, he found his hall locker combination, which was basically just Noah’s locker at this point.  My heart was seriously racing the whole day.  We just had to find a time when he wouldn’t be around to look through his stuff.  It felt so incredibly wrong and exciting at the same time.  Karen had a car, so we figured we could stay at school until after most kids left, go through his locker to see if there were any more drawings of me or other girls, then she could drive us home.  After the last class of the day, we stood near the girls’ bathroom and staked out his locker.  He grabbed his jacket, slammed the locker shut, and left.  We waited until most of the buses took off.  My face was flushed and felt like it was on fire, my stomach was twitching and fluttering and felt like it was in my throat.  I had felt a huge sense of guilt mixed in with the excitement… what if that hadn’t been a drawing of me and now we’re invading this loner’s personal property?  What if someone caught us?  But Shelley and Karen were apparently less nervous and we casually walked over.  Karen spun the combo and opened the door.  

There were a bunch of textbooks and a few binders and folders stacked underneath them at the bottom of the locker.   We pulled out the text books and noticed pieces of paper sticking out of them.  There were tons of drawings crammed in between the pages.  A lot of stuff looked like it was from video games or something…lots of dragons, monsters, some were of people (no one we knew), attractive gothic-looking girls, a few anime-looking doodles, looming buildings, castles.  The sketches in the textbooks were just pencil or pen, and I couldn’t find the one of me from history class, but the ones in the binders and folders were mostly done in colored pencil.  So we started going through those.  They were generally better-drawn, some really good, some just so-so.  There was some darkly themed stuff like monsters and misshapen faces.  Then we get to this red folder near the bottom that’s tucked into one of the binders.  Karen opened it and pulled out the first picture.  Ugh, My heart skips beats just writing about it, it brings back the memory so clearly.  I’m taking deep breaths here.   

 It was unmistakably me, I could barely even look at it.  My breathing got shallow and I got tunnel vision from all the adrenaline coursing through me.  I thought I was going to pass out.  It was me in bed with a scared/paranoid expression and my eyes were looking to the side like I was ready to turn around and look behind me.  In the background was a looming window, and partially blocking the window and partially in the shadows, was the “man”…Shadow-Looker.  

A flood of emotions came back, like it suddenly sparked repressed memories.  When I was between ages 4 and 6, I had these recurring visions and feelings of being watched.  Sometimes at night, sometimes while playing during the day.  Pretty much all kids get those feelings.  My boogeyman was a dark figure, black and barely transparent, with shoulders that sloped down a little too much, and a neck that was just a little too wide to be human.  It just had two pinpoints of orange light for eyes.  I would run to my parents whenever I hallucinated Shadow-Looker.  And they weren’t really full blown hallucinations, just glimpses or impressions of him, nothing solid.  If it was the middle of the night, I’d hide trembling under my sheets until sleep got the best of me.  On a side note, I originally called him “Black man” to my parents, but they told me I couldn’t call it that and I didn’t understand why, but now I realize that it sounded racially insensitive if I ever went talking about it to anyone else.  So I started calling him Shadow-Looker, and they convinced me it was “just a mirage” and my imagination was playing tricks on me.  Eventually I stopped seeing him and didn’t have any more paranoid feelings of being watched, and of course by the time I saw Noah’s drawing I had forgotten about him almost entirely.  But there he was in Noah’s picture, watching me in bed….two pinpoints of orange pencil and those drooping shoulders. 

I didn’t say anything, all I could hear was a rushing sound in my ears with the faint “Oh my God, that’s you! That’s sooo you!  This is soooo creepy!” from Shelley and Karen in the background.  That was the only picture of me in the folder, I never found the sketch from history class (and I don’t think it was the same pic but colored in).  It’s possible Shelley kept the picture somewhere, but I wouldn’t even look at it again or touch it.  I told them to just leave it alone and to never provoke Noah.  I never told them about Shadow-Looker.  I asked my mom about my hallucinations of Shadow-Looker a few years after this incident and she said sometimes I was terrified of it, and once I drew him with the tiny orange eyes and she asked me “Shouldn’t his eyes be bigger?” and I said “They’re not for seeing.” and it really creeped her out.   

Needless to say, I avoided Noah for the rest of high school.  I couldn’t even look in his direction.  I think he still lives in the same town, but I moved away after college.

I used to live in Yellowstone park when i was a kid and my family lived in a 100 year old officer's quarters from when the park used to be a military base. ( http://www.panoramio.com/photo/25295286 ) Anyway, they did a complete restoration on the house before we moved in and they found 3 hidden rooms, all completely walled off. I guess they were built to hide from Indians if shit hit the fan. What's really creepy though is that one of the rooms had a tiny, child sized desk and chair in the middle of it and a candle on the desk (sealed away for at least 80 years). I was never able to find out any more information. Still creeps me out. ",nosleep,daversa,/r/nosleep/comments/f2l46/yellowstone_hidden_room/

86,Worse than worst,1295050599,"I was only groggy for a moment or two.  I stopped breathing and absolutely froze, every sense on overdrive as I focused on the noise that woke me.

Let me readily admit that I'm one of many among us swept up in the ""zombie craze"" of the Zombie Survival Guide, World War Z, Walking Dead, etc. etc...  I like to think (in true hipster fashion) that I was attuned to the threat of an undead rising before it became mainstream.  Preparedness would probably be the best defense against a zombie outbreak and it's an interesting topic to mull over when bored, so...  Better be ready than excoriated, right?  So paranoia encroached upon my sleep and triggered some latent instinctual impulse that jolted me from a peaceful slumber into adrenaline-pumping readiness in what seemed like an instant.  After a split second of absolute concentration, I was convinced: the low, grating moan I could but faintly discern from the nearly-silent ambient hum of my two-story rural farmhouse was just outside my bedroom.  My worst fear had been realized.

I bolted out of bed, mindful to be completely silent in my movements, and got dressed almost automatically.  I was more attuned to pinpointing the noise.  It was clearly discernible as a low moan and was almost stereotypically zombie-like.  A flash of fear ran through me to my core as I realized that a zombie might actually be roaming through my house.  Is it a family member?  Are they safe?  What would I do if a younger brother or sister had been turned?  Could I bear neutralizing them?  Could I afford allowing them to live in pursuit of me, dangerously drawing attention?  All these thoughts raced through my mind and I suddenly felt gripped by a fear like none I'd ever felt.

I was ready.  I was dressed.  I had a modest pocket-knife and a small backpack that was still packed from a recent hiking trip...  Now what?  I decided it was best to collect as much information as possible.  The moaning had been continuing nearly incessantly for the fifteen to twenty seconds it took for all of this to transpire.  I strained my hearing...  and it stopped.  It was a few seconds before I heard a faint gasp, the faint sound of sucking air and a kind of small gurgle before the moaning picked back up.  It was throatier now, deeper...  Different.  And this time I could pinpoint it as coming from on the other side of the wall directly opposite the foot of my bed.

""Oooooooh...""

It was coming from my sister's room.

""Ooooh... Oh, yes...""

87,"I want to keep writing this, maybe turn it into a book. What do you think?",1295049132,"Why couldn't it have been zombies? Zombies I can handle. One quick shot to the head and they're dead. Again. Shoot, I killed 12 this morning before breakfast. Man, the fact I was able to eat so soon afterwards is insane. This place is beginning to grow on me. I run down a dark alleyway not bothering to shoot a flare or shine a flashlight down it first. Believe me, whatever lives down here is nothing compared to what’s chasing me. How are you supposed to kill something that has probably at one point tried to take a bite out of Jesus? And not in the symbolic bread sort of way. Makes me feel kind of honored, in an ""I am about to die"" sort of way. Hearing the claws and gnashing teeth of the hell beast behind me is enough to snap me back to reality. I weigh my options, I could climb a fire escape and be in plain sight, hop into a dumpster and pray it's not one of the living kind or stand here and get eaten alive (I didn't say they were good ones) I opt for dumpster diving. I open the lid and hop in; before the lid slams shut I can already tell this was not my lucky day. The smell of rotting meat burns my nose and waters my eyes. That pre-vomital rich spit floods my mouth. Plus side, I no longer smell like me so Satan's little helper probably can’t find me. Bad news, I am waist deep in disgusting. It had to be a red dumpster, didn't it? When a department store has a damaged product, what can't be salvaged must be dumped. Well, here the same goes for their employees. I reach for my flashlight in my pocket. Something just brushed past my leg. The loud sniffing outside my hidey hole is the only thing that keeps me from jumping out right then and there. I turn my light on and squint a little, the bright light being just a bit too bright for me now. Shining around to get a look at my new surroundings I see they too are getting a look at me. Amongst the rotting severed arms and legs, a few heads blink and snap their jaws at me. Sad actually, these places are supposed to kill them before dumping them. A quick look around settles my fears of being bit by a severed head for now. I place my ear against the dumpster wall and hold my breath, listening. The sniffing stops, and suddenly I wish it hadn't. Thunder claps way off in the distance and the sound of multiple deep voices talking backwards with screams throughout soon follows. The beast lets out a loud roar and then I hear claws quickly scrapping on the floor and getting fainter and fainter. I'm sorry to say I was frozen in fear and spent an extra five minutes in the dumpster just in case. To put this into perspective, I preferred to stay in a dumpster filled with rotting body parts and zombie heads trying to bite me then to go outside. How am I not dead from the stress alone? I slowly step out into the alley, the fresh air filling my lungs. Too little too late. I slam down on my knees and cough hard, my ribs scrapping against my hip bones and I throw up the little I ate that morning. Wheezing and trying to get my head to stop spinning I sit on the ground and lean back on the dumpster. I close my eyes and breathe deep. They snap open seconds later when I hear the slurping sounds. Eyes blurred, I make out a cat, licking up my vomit, my stomach does a back flip and begins to eject round two but my eyes clear up and I swallow. Suddenly the dumpster doesn't seem so bad. For the most part I was right, it was a cat licking up my vomit, but I use the word cat loosely. Black fur dirty and tangled. Matted with blood. lick lick lick. This cat has no eyes.lick lick. Its face covered with dry blood, and coming out of each eye socket is a babies arm. These are working together to support a severed infants head. Holding it on either side of its jaw. Muscles and tendons swing from its neck. Dangling. Its eyes sewn shut. Lick lick lick. This is too much, the sight of it caused me to jump up to my feet and let out whimper. The licking stops. Its heads look in my direction. The cat mouth hisses as the infants mouth opens to the sound of gurgling as blood pools out of its mouth.

88,The faceless man,1295047065,"Through my life I have had a recurring dream that has all but faded away in the recent years. I believe the last time I had the dream was roughly 15 years ago (give or take) but the dream is still very vivid and fresh in my mind. Every time I talk about this dream every hair on my back and arms stand up and I can feel a cold icy chill going down my spine and the haunting feeling that I'm being watched. 
 
The dream is very simple and not very long, but is very profound. It starts with me as a child (no matter my current age) and I am sitting on the blue floor of my bedroom. Next to the door is my dresser and I am sitting in front of it playing with my toy trucks and cars. Suddenly I hear a scream from down the hallway. I rush down the hallway into the main living room that opens up to the right of the hallway to see a very large man standing in front of someone (usually a female or someone I love - Mother, Wife, Friend, etc.) and this person slumps down backwards apparently dead as the shriek was bone chilling. I look up at the man (as I have only seen from his chest down at this point) and he has no face. Worse than no face, his face is shifting and moving (think of the characters from ""Jacob's Ladder"" as a good example). He stands there presumably staring at me for a short amount of time before lunging at me with his hands outstretched for me and let's out a horrifically low growl akin to a wolf that has been gargling razor blades. 
 
At this point I awaken from the dream with a huge startle. I'm usually crying or sweating, but I am always sitting on the floor next to my bed slumped over forwards.

All the same people are going to be there. Including him. He comes once a year, give or take, and it’s always bad. He doesn’t look scary, just taller and older than me and my friends and he wears a dark brown coat that flows behind him wherever he walks. He has an authority about him that all of the people that should help me when he gets me in his clutches just kind of ignore my cries for help. I always try to punch him, scratch his eyes out, do anything to hurt him; it never works. He talks in a soothing voice but there is menace behind it. He only threatens me and my family and nobody ever believes that such a nice guy could say what he says. Things like “I’ll rip their stomach out while they sleep” and “Your little brother tastes real good, I bet.” Besides the attempts at physical attacks I can only cry on his day. He follows me and whispers horrible nothings into my ear. If the others can see him they can’t hear him. Then they would know that he is evil. Mostly their eyes just slide over him and they register, barely, that he is there. He follows me to my classes and sits behind me and the other kids don’t want to sit near me because they know he is there and they are afraid that he will visit them. He will, at least once, likely many times. Then the sun goes down and he does the real damage. Last year he killed my cat. My mom said that a car ran over him, but I know that it was really the evil man who did it. This year he took my turtle away and brought it back without its shell and its head. After he shows me my dead pets he walks down the street into the twilight and laughs. I cry in my bed that night and I am sad for the rest of the week.

92,My Experience with a house I believe to be haunted,1295033209,"About 3 years ago my grand parents got a new house.  I visited it frequently and spent the night there a lot because I lived at my mom's apartment which is 10 minutes away and I'd much rather stay at a nice house.

I was home alone for the first time and was in the upstairs bathroom taking a piss.  It was day time. I heard one of those [spring Door stops](http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/0/0/1/1/2/7/webimg/19831349_o.jpg)  start buzzing.  I didn't think much of it cause my grand mother has Chihuahuas so I assumed one of them ran across the door stop.  That's when I realized my grand mother brought them to the vet to get their nails clipped.


I thought that was a little weird so I went around the small upstairs apartment looking for the door stop when I realized the house doesn't have those kind of door stops.  I thought it was a little creepy but I shrugged it of and decided to go down stairs to the main floor living room.  ""It was probably just air going through the vents""  I thought to myself.

Before I go on let me explain a little how the house is situated.  The main floor has two sets of stairs which have 7 steps each. these stairs are right next to each other.  The left set goes up to the top floor.  the upstairs area isn't even a hallway, it's only got 3 walls which lead to 4 rooms which include(from left to right) the bathroom on the left wall, my grand mothers bedroom and the guest room on the wall in front of you as soon as you reach the top of the stairs, and my grand fathers room on the right wall.  The right set of stairs goes down into the den and from the top stair you can see the upstairs guest bedroom.

So I was upstairs and heading for the den, so I had to go down two sets of stairs. As soon as I put my foot down on the first step it creaked softly;  The second step, a little louder.  This pattern continued until I reached the step leading to the Den.  When I put my foot on it I I heard a sound coming from the guest bedroom.  I quickly looked up at the room and heard what sounded like a shit storm of dressers and furniture falling over.  It was REALLY loud.  Goose bumps formed on the back of my neck.  I went into the den, turned on the TV, and waited for some one to come home.  When my grandma got home I told her what happened we went up into the room and everything was in its correct spot.  Nothing looked touched.  I was thoroughly creeped out. 


Fast forward 1 year.  One morning  my grand mother claims she saw some weird white cloth like thing floating by her bedroom door the night before.  She says she screamed at the top of her lungs but no one responded


Fast forward a year and a half(about 6 months ago)

I move in with my grandparents.  My room is now what was formally the guest room.  It was a Sunday and I was taking an afternoon nap.  I woke up, stretched for a second and then closed my eyes.  As soon as I closed them I was looking in a mirror and behind the mirror  was darkness.  My reflection looked at me and started grinning maniacally at me and pulling its own hair.  I instantly opened my eyes.  I was paralyzed but I could still feel pressure on my head(Where I couldn't see) as if some one was pulling my hair. 

I looked around the room frantically for some sort of help.  I just couldn't shake out of it like I had before when in sleep paralysis,  I heard my grand mother in the hallway and tried to call out for her but just couldn't.  After about 30 seconds the paralysis stopped along with the hair pulling.  I laid there for a second then bolted out of the bed toward the door.  I went down stairs and told my grand father about it.  He reminds me every once and a while about the fear he saw in my eyes.

Now, I've had sleep paralysis before, but my eyes are usually closed and I can just shake out of it.  This just felt different.

95,Ever turn the TV on to calm your nerves?,1295020193,"Me too. Usually it helps calm my nerves really well, especially after a night of playing Amnesia. However one particular time I had, let's say an ""experience"".

It was exactly 1 year since my mom passed away from cancer. Me and my dad had been dealing with it pretty well in the recent months and we decided to have a mini memorial for her, nothing big just a nice dinner and maybe a fire in the fireplace (she loved sitting by the fire). So after dinner we were sitting I'm front of the fire place and my dad asks if I wanted to play a board game. I say sure, might as well. So he goes into the ottoman that contains them all, and is searching through. He calls out the name of each one, most of which I respond with no or maybe. Then he gets to the bottom of the pile. 

""huh, look at this, an old ouija board me and your mom used to play with"". Naturally this sparks my interest, having never used one before. I suggest we try it just for the hell of it but my dad is reluctant. I convince him after a few minutes of badgering, so he lays it out righting the coffee table. We place both our hands on the glass viewer thing, to no avail however. It doesn't move on it's own as we try to ask questions to the""spirits"" in our house, so we get bored and put it away. 

Later that night as I sat by my computer reading 4chan's /x/ board I started to get a little freaked out, so I turn on the TV next to my monitor. To my surprise the cable box was off, and actually unplugged, which meant about a 10 minute blue loading screen. So I get under my desk, plug it in, and watch the screen start to load as the display on the cable box says ""bOOt"". 

My attention drifts back to my browser window as I wait for the boot screen to clear. Maybe a minute or two passed by, when I glanced back at the TV. The traditional blue screen with the service providers logo isn't up, instead it's just a wall of gibberish text that seemingly is scrolling upwards, almost being generated at random, as if the signals it was recording were being misinterpreted as text instead of video. Although I know it is obviously just a glitch I am ingrigued by it. I stare at the wall of text as it scrolls by, looking to see what will happen next, mostly because I sure as hell didn't want to climb back under my desk. I started to notice strings of letters in succesion, starting to loom like words. It was a few at first, then more and more. The words ""son"", ""fire"", and ""mom"" stuck out in my mind at first. 

The closer I looked the more I believed that my cable box was connected to an other worldly entity. Before any truly meaningful strings of characters could be formed the cable box shut itself off with a loud CLICK. I turned it back on and it seemed to work normally. 

So what do I think it was? I have no idea, I'd like to think it was my mom trying to tell me something, but chances are it was just a really weird hardware malfunction. Needless to say I didn't sleep much that night. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f29la/ever_turn_the_tv_on_to_calm_your_nerves/
96,Cackling,1295017090,"I might have been 13 or 14 when this happened, till this day the situation lurks in my head. 

My parents left me home alone one evening in the fall to go to a dinner party. It wasn't usual that they'd leave me by myself, for I must admit I was a 'troubled' child. Last time they left me alone I'd managed to break a few things, including burning up a broom in the fireplace. (Yeah...I get bored easily.) 

So this particular night I wasn't feeling so mischievous and I just sat around watching TV and chatting on AIM with a few friends to pass the time before my parents got home. I'd like to say it was around 10 p.m when I got the phone call. 

I ran to the phone, thinking it was my parents asking if I'd like anything from the restaurant before they left. When I picked it up, all I could hear was laughing. No, more like cackling. I thought it was my friend playing a prank on me since I'd told him I was alone waiting for my family, and when I called out his name the voice continued to cackle at me. I hung up, annoyed and went back to the computer. 

Not ten minutes later the phone rang again. The thought didn't occur to me that it could have been the same person, so I answered. Cackling. I hung up immediately and paranoia swept over me. I ran to the windows, shutting the blinds and to the doors to lock them as well. We didn't have caller ID, when I *69'd the number, it gave me some long number I'd never heard of. The area code wasn't even the same as mine. 

I, being the scared little thing I was at that age, ran to my room, went under the blankets of my bed and watched TV huddled beside my cat who, at the moment, was the only thing I felt could save me if I were to be attacked. The phone rang again. 

Fuck that. 

And it kept ringing for a good 10 minutes before it finally ended and my parents came home soon after. I thrashed myself out of my bed and went downstairs to greet them. I asked if they tried calling me, they denied it. I told them what happened and they only laughed, telling me to stop watching those scary movies and getting up tight. 

I never knew who was on the phone. The cackling will never leave my head. I will forever be haunted by that noise. ",nosleep,krasyva,/r/nosleep/comments/f28ny/cackling/

 Well, my two roommates (each being in a monogamous relationship) decided it would be cool to spend the weekend with their respective girlfriends. I, however, am not involved. I stayed home. Alone. After reading /r/nosleep for a good two or three hours I decided it might just be time for bed.

 So, I turned out all the lights, climbed under the covers, and attempted to hit the hay. Not fifteen minutes later I get this feeling as though I'm being watched. I can literally see (in my head) this little girl with black hair standing in front of my mini-fridge and just SEETHING at me, and I can hear her sort of knocking against the wall. It's pretty unnerving.

 Now, I'm not one to let things disturb me when I sleep. It's MY sleep, and is not to be fucked with. I've gotten into shouting matches over people waking me up before it is time, and everybody knows that I don't take kindly to it. So I fling off my covers and stand up as fast as I can, turning on the light and rapidly searching my room for whatever is off about my night, be it a smell, something new in the apartment... I don't know what I was thinking.

 I ripped open the mini-fridge, it's empty except for a case of budweiser spread evenly throughout (classy, huh?) and checked under the bed. Next I threw open my closet door and looked blindly for anything that could be making that noise. This is where I first realised that I could still be startled like I was still a nine year old.

 ALL, literally ALL of my clothes were off of their hangers and on the floor. The hangers were all rocking back and forth wildly as though this had just happpened. The small dresser I keep in my closet was open, and all the clothes inside it were draped over the edges of the drawers. So I am now freaked out, and loudly announce to the empty apartment that ""Whoever is fucking with me, had better knock it off before shit gets violent."" In response, a solid knock comes from my living room window, just outside my bedroom. It repeats itself four to five times, rapidly, as though the fedex man had sprouted wings and decided to make a 3 AM pit stop at my second story window.

 Me, being a man, thinks it would be wise to check this out (in case of break-ins, a tree branch that needs to be moved, etcetera. I'm pretty rational.) I walk out into the living room, and that same feeling of unease comes over me. Only stronger, and more... I don't know, rage filled.

 I pull open my venetian blinds and look outside. Nothing. Then, some movement catches my attention and I see the same little girl staring directly at me, obviously she wants to destroy my soul. At this point I've been reduced from awesome cool asskicking John, to quivering little girl John, but I'm still not about to let some prepubescent twat ruin the last bastion of sanity I have. I shut the blinds, return to my room, and go to clean up my closet.

 The closet is perfect. Clothes are replaced on hangers, the drawers on the dresser are pulled to with the clothes neatly folded inside, I'd even say this entity has pressed my dress shirts and left them with the little creases that I like. Now, I'm just confused. I go check the window again, and wouldn't you know it the little girl was closer, and walking quickly through the parking lot all while looking directly at me and never faltering in her hate.

 In one last desperate attempt at manliness I ripped open my front door to confront her about it and stepped outside in my boxers, swearing loudly. Bad choice. Actually, worst choice of my life. (even taking into consideration that I once punched a 220 pound jiu jitsu dude for jokingly calling me a faggot.)  As soon as I open the door and turn to the right to head towards the stairs, I hear her footsteps go from quick to lightning fast. She's sprinting at me, and I'm armed with only my boxers and the little bit of pee left in my bladder that will probably come out shortly.

  In addition to the sprinting, there's a deep bass filled growling being issued from the base of the stairwell. After quivering on my door mat for a brief moment, I hear her (it) reach the stairs and begin taking them three at a time. I don't know about you, but I don't know many little girls that can take three stairs at a time while sprinting like Usain Bolt. My only thought is that this is no longer a little girl, but it is death incarnate come to make me its bitch.

 So I issue a small, fear filled ""Shit!"" and duck back into my apartment and lock and deadbolt it. As soon as I do that, the footsteps slow again. Now, it's just toying with my emotions. She reaches my front door and stops. I can hear her breathing. I am no longer quivering little girl John, I am worlds fastest get-back-to-your-room-hide-under-the-covers-and-pretend-it-never-happened man. I ended up sleeping in a position I call ""The cocoon"" It's much like ""the tuck"", but also involves making damn sure that blanket is over your head.

  Surprisingly, I had no trouble getting to sleep, or even staying asleep. When I woke up, I wasn't in ""the cocoon"", none of the lights were on, and my closet was still closed. The only thing I can think is that I had an extremely vivid dream.

  I just can't explain why I found a completely destroyed pair of little girls sneakers in the parking lot the next morning.

**TL;DR** Little girls suck, and this subreddit is like masochism on your subconscious.

98,"maxwell, the train engineer",1294990395,"this story was told to me by my mom, years after it happened...

a few years before i was born, both my parents and sister lived on an air-force base in oklahoma. the year was 1985 or somewhere around there. my dad was an army recruiter at the time and my mom was a homemaker; staying at home all day with the family dog, alf.

my mom was at home alone for most of the day…my dad worked a nine to five job while my sister went to school. occasionally my mom would complain to my dad that she didn't feel right or felt like something was watching her. my dad, being the military man he was, wrote this off as her just being alone for too long. my mom would continue to complain that there was something else in the house regardless of my dad's reassurance. this went on for quite some time.

the feelings then grew into actual events. she began to notice things were getting misplaced. folded clothes on beds would be thrown on the floor, keys would go missing, etc. she began to doubt herself. no one else in the house was experiencing these events, and it was frustrating to her. she thought she was losing her mind.

the severity of the encounters increased significantly after about a month of the misplacing of items and the strange feelings. one day while in my sister's room, my mom encountered a black entity. she described it as a dense black cloud. this manifestation entered the room from a wall, hovered over my sister's bed, then vanished back into the wall. my mom instantly removed herself from the room and called my dad. she was worried that this apparition was targeting her daughter. my dad calmed her down over the phone and the ordeal was no longer spoke of.

soon after, the dog family dog, alf, began sensing the presence of the entity. sometimes, alf would sit and stare for hours at a time at a particular spot and refuse to enter certain rooms. this strange behavior still did not convince my dad. most of this ghost talk was obviously sheltered from my sister. they didn't want her to get frightened. that's one of the reasons why my dad chose to not talk about it.

another day while at home, after the black entity incident, my mom was watching tv when she heard alf bark. she followed the sound and ended up in my sister's room. my sister had a small rocking crib, which she used to play with her toys. as my mom entered the room, she noticed the dog watching the rocking crib rock back and forth. the heightened her fear that whatever was in the house was targeting my sister. she reported her incident to my father, who once again shot it down with skepticism.
the final paranormal event happened on a normal day…keep in mind that these events all happened during the day in fully lit rooms, etc. as my mom was walking from the kitchen to the bathroom, she entered the hallway and froze in sheer terror…

there was a man standing at the end of the hallway: a full body apparition. the man was dressed in old engineer garb, looking like he just got off a train; oil spills here and  there, dirty as can be. he did not speak and she did not speak, but she knew his name. she told me his name was maxwell. she didn’t know how she knew, but there was something telling her without words that his name was maxwell. she said every single hair on her body rose to the very highest point they could go. after what seemed like hours, maxwell turned around and disappeared around the corner.

she immediately told my dad what had happened during the day. she no longer felt safe in the house. who knows how many entities were actually occupying the household. luckily, she got her request… they soon moved out of state to illinois, but not because of paranormal activity, but because my dad got transferred to a different air-force base. he continued to deny anything ever happening in that house, but i think he just didn’t want to believe it. 

years after my mom told me this story, i found out that my dad had paranormal experiences as a child that were severely fucked up. this explains why he didn’t want to acknowledge any of the weird happenings that were occurring at the house in oklahoma.",nosleep,johnmenchaca,/r/nosleep/comments/f23n3/maxwell_the_train_engineer/
99,another eerie tale of nosleep for stoicme,1294983831,"I have had a few eerie experiences in my life, but this is easily the scariest. Prior to moving to where I am now, I lived in a camper parked at the side of my parent's house. It gave me privacy, while not making me pay rent.

So I sitting in the main house one night watching TV, when I decide I'm sleepy (at 1:00am). I turn off the TV and head outside. As I'm walking across the yard, I suddenly get the urge to walk to the far end near the road. I stop at the wire fence my parents put up (it kept the then 3 year old in the yard) and looked out. Something seemed wrong, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. I looked around but everything seemed fine.

Then I noticed it... one of the fence posts had two shadows, and one of those shadows was going in the completely wrong direction. I thought to myself *""that's really odd""* but right at that moment I heard a noise behind me. My damn cat knocked over a flower pot. I turned back to the shadow, but it suddenly was gone. 

Okay, so that was weird. But maybe I just imagined it. I take one more look around, searching for anything out of the normal and boy did I find it. Our neighbors across the street had a garage door facing my house, and I am POSITIVE there was nothing there before. But now... now there was a mostly human shaped shadow on it. I was freaking out to say the least, but then another thought hit me... there were TWO floodlights lighting that garage door. They were pointing right on it. And this shadow had incredibly crisp edges, almost like it had been cut right out of a piece of paper. Nothing about this seemed right.

I look behind me quickly, though I'm not sure why. Perhaps it was simple paranoia, like I needed to make sure there wasn't anything behind me. But I look back, and the shadow had changed again. Suddenly it had spread out fingers, which were long and sharp, and needless to say, I was pretty terrified. I backed up as far as I could toward my camper, then I turned and ran. I got in, shut and locked the door, and turned on all my lights. 

I fell asleep with all my lights on. No way was I going to sleep in the dark. I rested pretty well for a few hours, but suddenly I was awoken by a loud bang on my door. I look at the clock and see I had only been asleep for 2 hours. I look out the window on my door, and see there's no one there. I figure I must have just dreamed it, but once I laid down again, there was another bang on my door. I immediately look at the door, but there's nothing there. I keep looking, and there's another bang. I hear the doorknob shake, then the entire door, but there's nothing there. Suddenly there is a bang on the side of my camper by my bed. I wish there had been another bang, but instead my entire camper started to shake.

The whole camper starts moving about 4 inches back and forth. Suddenly I hear an earsplitting screech, and when I looked out the window on the side that had been getting pushed on, and I see a very blurry outline on the wall of the house similar to the one I saw on the neighbor’s garage, but this one is not as crisp as the other. I watch as this shadow starts to dissolve into nothing.

I've no idea what the hell it was, but I looked out the window off the front of the camper, and I actually saw someone. It was still dark, but I could see they were wearing generic clothes, jeans and a hoodie (with the hood down). I couldn't make out the face before they turned around, hopped over the fence, and ran off down the street. I don’t know who that person was, or what they did, but I never had an issue in that camper again.
****
**EDIT** almost forgot to mention the next day. I asked my parents if they heard any weird noises that night, and while they said no, my younger sister (then about 3 and a half) had apparently over heard me asking and said something to the effect of ""the scary man screamed"". later that day I also went to the neighbors house whose garage I'd seen the shadow on, and asked about any weird things happening around here before (he'd lived there a lot longer than my family had). I gave him the short version of the night before and I watched as his eyes got huge, and he was visibly worried. when I mentioned the person I watched run off (who I don't think was too old, based on stature and what I could see of the clothing) my neighbor told me to leave it alone and he slammed the door in my face. prior to this he had been one of the friendliest guys I'd ever met, and after that day, he was still nice. I decided to heed his advice.",nosleep,stoicme,/r/nosleep/comments/f220m/another_eerie_tale_of_nosleep_for_stoicme/
0,What had they done with the leg? Where was it? Rotting somewhere in a hospital bin or incinerated? I became paralysed with the fear of seeing her again. ,1294983454,"  I had a fortunate upbringing; my parents raised me with discipline and caution and because of their guidance I was acutely aware of many of the global and economic issues occurring in the world at the time. Which also meant that I suffered a lot of mental torment over things like the potential of World War III breaking out, or contracting a terrifying but highly rare illness that I’d read about or seen on the news. I was very phobic of things and it impacted on my mental health and tormented my superego. If there was a phobia out there – I’d probably thought it up and frightened myself into a stupor over it.

  However being attuned to the world more than most of my friends at my age had its merits too. I was considered the “wise” one of the group. Even though I was only in 3rd grade at school friends and even family would turn to me for intuition or to simply listen to my empathic outlook on things. 

 My mom’s good friend Lilly was much older than I was, but she was so creative and sophisticated that I warmed to her at a very young age. We got along so well that sometimes at the end of a visit when my parents would go to bed, Lilly and I would sit up all night having lengthy debates and talking philosophy. I’d known her since I was just a tot, and she had little family of her own - so she was elected as my godmother. 

 When we moved states when I was in 4th grade we set up a guest room for friends and family at our new house. My parents were very hospitable and Lilly would often come and stay with us for a few nights at a time. She was the life of the party – we’d always look forward to her next stay.

 I loved having her with us because she was on a similar wave length to me, we understood one and other. I often had trouble sleeping at night because I’d keep myself up with my usual anguish. Lilly would wait until my parents were settled for the night, and I’d hear her open her guest room door at the end of the corridor and tip toe down the isle to my room.  She’d stand by my bedside and hum me these soothing melodies that somehow worked like a charm and often put me to sleep. She had a beautiful voice – I trusted her and it calmed me. 

 That year Lilly was in a terrible car accident back in my hometown that left her disfigured. She suffered severe burns to her throat, neck and chest, and she lost one of her legs. After the event, she stopped visiting because she spent a long time in recovery. Mom went down to stay with her a few weeks after the accident. She’d call us and inform us of Lilly’s recovery. I was busy tearing myself apart contracting my biggest and most potent phobia so far – Amputation. All I could imagine was my godmother laying in a hospital bed: a raw stump where her leg had once been; weak from the drugs and not able to navigate on her own. 

 When I learned from mom that she was out of hospital and had finally learnt to walk on her new aluminium leg, I became terrified of her. How could the lovely, lovely woman I’d known most of my life now have a quarter of her body missing; a huge metal rod shoved into her thigh where running blood and firm flesh had once stood. What had they done with the leg? Where was it? Rotting somewhere in a hospital bin or incinerated? I became paralysed with the fear of seeing her again. 

  Given the moral fibre I’d been raised with, I naturally didn’t tell the family about this morbid phobia, and Lilly eventually agreed for mom to pick her up and drive her up to our house for a visit. Mom warned me that Lilly wasn’t the same spirit that she was before and that she may need special attention. This made me wonder whether she may have been brain damaged in the accident. 

 The day she arrived with mom, we all gathered in the lounge the way we usually did when she visited. We had my uncle and aunt staying for lunch too. My heart was pounding and I was giddy with apprehension as I heard the car pull into the driveway. Dad went outside to help Lilly up the front steps and he came back in holding her around the waist and making loud banter. Everybody was cooing her presence with cacophonous and overcompensating laughter and small-talk. Lilly leaned against the doorway in silence and caught my eye. She didn’t look at me as though she recognised me – she gave me a dreamy hello with a raise of her hand and a twitch of a smile. She stood awkwardly on a frightfully skinny aluminium podium that met her thigh with a harness. Her eyes were dull, her burnt throat and neck discoloured and textured like stretched duck skin. 

 By the early evening the general mood in the house had grown ominous – for me at least. Lilly spoke very little; only mumbles and meek remarks. I tried to make an effort to mask my terror of her by sitting nearby and listening to my parents talk. Lilly often watched me, I could feel her eyes burning into me as I pretended to read. I could see the occasional glimmer of silver streaks from her prosthetic leg out of the corner of my eye. It was outstretched and protruding from under the dining table, like it was pointing right at me. I avoided looking at it as much as possible, but I couldn’t help but wonder if Lilly had picked up on my behaviour.

 That night after Lilly and my parents had gone to their rooms for the night, I lay awake in bed, gripped in total fear. I couldn’t get her image out of my head. I was too scared to use the bathroom because it was half way down the corridor to Lilly’s room. I kept imagining her sitting by the guest bed, untying the straps where the harness met the remains of what was once her thigh. Where did she put her leg while she slept? How would she navigate without it? She was now dependant of this metal contraption – her new lifelong companion. Her new footsteps in the sand.

 That’s when I heard a distant door click shut. I’d grown used to sleeping with my door ajar because it let the draft in from the rest of the house. It also amplified any external noises from my room: like the distant hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, or the occasional drip from the bathroom sink. Or the sound of a prosthetic leg being dragged down the corridor. 

 My heart jumped – I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I strained my ears and listened for any more sounds. Was I just imagining things? Holding my breath, I could hear the blood pulse through my eardrums so I exhaled slowly. Dead silence – just the usual house activity thank god. Then the noise came again. A metallic “clink” on the hardwood floor - followed by a human footfall - followed by a muffled scraping sound; like rubber being dragged along tiles. 

 I froze, listening to the slow, but very steady choreography. It sounded like it was nearing the halfway point of the corridor. I prayed that she would turn towards the bathroom. But the sounds grew stronger, closer. That unfamiliar and daunting “clink” from the base of the prosthetic leg tapping the floor.

 Cowering in my sweaty sheets I turned my body to face the door, pull the cover over my face and tightly closed my eyes. The clinking and dragging grew louder and louder, then stopped at my door. I heard the hinges creak as it was opened wide. I couldn’t control my breath, sharply drawing air into my burning nostrils and lungs. I blocked both ears and kept my eyes clamped shut, my lungs burning with the desire to let out a scream. 

 I lay shivering and pulse throbbing while the blood vessels in my tightly shut eyes painted abstract images on a blank canvas. I briefly unblocked my ears. No sounds. No clinking or dragging of metal on the floor of my room.

  Taking a bold gamble I lowered the sheet and briefly opened one eye. Then both. In the very dim light of my room, she appeared to be gone. Either that or she never actually entered my room. From where my head lay facing the door I could faintly make out the shape of my door standing open. But she was gone! 

 I was contemplating making an audacious dash to mom and dad’s room when I saw Lilly’s prosthetic leg standing up straight in the middle of my floor. Despite my mature statue I let out a shrill whimper and I froze in agonizing terror. It stood facing me, shimmering in the low light; the stench of wet leather growing stronger. 

 I was too scared to scan the room, I was too scared to call for help. Because I knew where Lilly had gone. Under my bed: her charred face planted against the cold floor, her stump protruding from under the frame like a fleshy foot-step beckoning to be used.

 I held my breath and closed my eyes, that scream fighting to burst out of my lungs at any second. Once again pulling my hands up to my ears, blocking out the reality of terror, I lay on my back in the pitch darkness wishing her away. Slowly drifting into a delirious state of calm as I blocked her out. She can’t hurt me. She can’t hurt me.

 That’s when I heard a muffled rude awakening through my blocked ears, like a distant ghost train tooting in the mist. Unblocking my ears and opening my eyes, I looked up at the head of the bed above me at Lilly. There she was, perched on the headboard like a gaunt puppet leaning over me, a gravelly tune being pushed out through her burnt lips as she hummed me her lullaby to put me to rest.

3,Have you died in your dreams? Let's share.  I'll go first...,1294981521,"I’m sure you’ve all heard the myth that if you die in your dreams, you die in real life.  Well, I can tell you it’s just a myth.  I’ve had three dreams where I’ve died; all of them very different and creepy in their own ways. 

In my first dream, I was in some sort of crowded conference building high atop a cliff.  Through a wall of windows I could see that it was pouring down rain outside.  The view looked out over the cliff toward the ocean.  It was actually very peaceful…

…Until the building started to shake.  The ground was eroding out from under us, and within moments the entire building was in freefall, headed down to the rocky shoreline.  I distinctly remember free-falling long enough that I cam to the conclusion that this was the end.  There was no way to fall for this long and survive the impact.  

Then we hit. Everything went black.  

But the dream wasn’t over.  

I woke up in a small white bed that wasn’t my own, in a room that I’d never been in before.  Everything was grey and washed out.  Almost all of the color had left the world, but I seemed to be alive.  As I stepped out of the bed, my family dog (a weinerdog) ran by my feet.  This is when I knew something was wrong.  It was our dog that had been dead for over 7 years. 

I must be dead.  I’ve got to be dead.  

The first thing I thought to do was to rush to the hospital and see if my body was there.  

As I arrive at the hospital, I get into the elevator.  There is a woman already inside.  She’s 40’s, short, kind-looking.  As the elevator starts to go up, I turn to her and ask, “Do I look dead to you?”  She casually glances at me and responds with a calm, “No, I don’t think so.” 

I then say, “No, look into my eyes.” 

I lean toward her so that our eyes are level, and as she looks into them, looking for something, her expression changes.  Her brow falls, and her voice becomes grave as she says, “Oh.  I don’t know…” 

That’s when I jerk awake, trying to shake off how real the dream felt. 

The second dream in which I died was a bit shorter, but played with my emotions a bit more.  

I was in a dark marsh.  Nothing was around me except for dark waters and reeds pricking the surface.  I don’t recall how I got there, but my legs were in the water as I floated atop a bobbing ice chest.  

Almost immediately, though, the ice chest started to sink.  I tried to use it as much as I could to stay afloat, but it wanted to leave.  As it disappeared into the murk, I could feel myself going with it.  I couldn’t stay above the water and I was alone, so I didn’t bother yelling.  

As my head dipped below the surface, I didn’t struggle nearly as much as I wanted to.  There wasn’t much of a point.  There wouldn’t be anything to hold onto had I made it back up.  And as the water distorted what little light I could see, I realized I was dying.  With that, everything went black.  

But again, the dream didn’t end there.  

Moments later, I found myself in a small wooden canoe in that marsh.  I was panicking because I knew I’d just died in those waters.  I immediately dip my hands over the side of the boat and start to franticly paddle to where I’d went under. 

By the time I get to where I think I was, it seems like too much time has passed… five minutes or so… but I start to paw around in the dark, trying to find myself.  In the same way you know you need water when you’re thirsty, I knew I needed to find my drowned body. 

Finally, I grab onto something. It’s my own limp arm.  I struggle against the weight of myself, trying to pull myself into the canoe, but the clothes are wet and heavy and the body is tangled in discarded fishing line. 

Finally, using all of my strength, I extract myself from the cold water, but I’m dead.  The eyes are glassy and the body isn’t moving. 

Now, I don’t know what compelled me, but I jammed my fingers down the throat of my lifeless body and I’m met with resistance.  There is something in there.  I grab onto it.  I can’t tell what it is because it’s coated in swamp moss, but as I pull it out of my body’s throat, my lifeless body violently jerks, rocking the boat.  
And with that, I jerk awake. 

And the third dream… I don’t tell anyone about the third dream.  ",nosleep,pzycho,/r/nosleep/comments/f21dx/have_you_died_in_your_dreams_lets_share_ill_go/
4,i'm starting to suspect my apartment is haunted?,1294977521,"okay, i'm going to list a few separate, recent incidents that have taken place in my apartment, all within the past year, and what i want you guys to do is try to figure a rational explanation for all of this.  i live with three other girls and one cat. we are all in our twenties, and we live in toronto's west end, above a store. 

* periodically (perhaps once every three months or so) my roommate will feel a cat jump on to her bed in the morning. she'll open her eyes and look, expecting to see the house cat (kitty), but nothing will be there. on one occasion, my roommate was hanging out with kitty when kitty suddenly saw something, froze, and then bolted out of the room. moments later, she felt the footsteps of a small, invisible animal jump on to the bed. 

* one night, about two weeks ago, i was lying in bed waiting to fall asleep, and someone or something started to quietly strum a balalaika that i keep on a shelf in my room. it strummed once, and then once more a couple minutes later, and i supposed it was my imagination. after about five minutes it started playing for a sustained amount of time. nothing musical, just strumming up and down, quietly, and a bit carelessly. i remember not being scared per se, but unwilling to acknowledge what was happening by turning on a light. i just lay there and listened. 

* just this morning i got out of bed, took a shower, and returned to my room to find my bed had physically moved about a foot out from the wall. i'm not sure exactly when it moved - either it happened over night while i was in bed, or when i was in the shower. it had indeed moved an entire foot, and the difference was obvious upon entering my room. my bed is fairly heavy as well - when i pushed the bed back towards the wall, i realized that it took quite a bit of energy. there is nothing behind the bedframe that i would never need, and i did not have sex last night, so *that's* out of the question. 

what do you guys think? both the ghost cat that my roommate feels and the playing of my balalaika can be explained away by hallucinations, due to the fact that we were just going into, or coming out of sleep when it happened. i can tell you though, that i listened to the balalaika, eyes open, thinking very lucidly that there is no doubt that someone or something was strumming that instrument. i tried to rationalize it by attributing the strumming to the rumble caused by a passing train. (a train passes relatively close to my apartment several times per day). but, i haven't heard it since.  

last, i, for the life of me, can't figure out how my bed moved? 


whatever has been happening in the apartment as of late hasn't filled me with any dread or negative vibes, so if it is a ghost, it seems pretty chill. i've actually asked out loud for it to please ixnay the aunting-hay. 

i don't know. i'm not joshing you guys. go ahead and hypothesize. 

edit: i just thought of another strange incident! this happened about three nights ago. it was 10pm or so, i was hanging out in my room, reading, and i heard a big bang in the apartment. i got up and investigated, and found the cat was all freaked out, tearing across the apartment. i turned on the light in the bathroom (where the litter box is) and found fresh, unburied poo in the box, as well as a piece of poo on the bathroom floor. my cat is extremely well trained, and we take care of her box. we never have problems with her. what i figure happened was kitty must have bolted *while* pooing! something must have spooked her, caused her to jump while inside the box, (this is a fully enclosed litter box with a lid), which caused the crash, and the situation i found. either it was the ghost, or something rational spooked her?

6,I had this strangely vivid dream..,1294971787,"I woke up today, remembering most of the dream events. Here is how it goes..
I was on a ferry, it was fairly crowded. The only known person with me there was one of my best friends, she was wearing a cyan hoodie, and I a dark leather jacket. We were walking to the front of the ferry when a pickpocket steals my friend's wallet (wallet not purse) and she runs after him. As I run being to run myself, i also check my own pockets to see if I had my cards with me, however in my hurry i drop one of them in to another passengers open backpack. I quickly grab it and try to catch up to her but she is no where in sight. The ferry itself has a weird design, it is in two parts running parallel, like two train carriages next to each other but with no connection in the middle. So I run to the right side (she was pickpocketed in the left half of the ferry) and still no sign of her. Seconds later there is an announcement on the speakers, ""Could Mr. Monroe please stand down"". I assumed this Monroe was the thief, still no sign of disturbance anywhere.. So i return to the other side of the ferry, and no disturbance here either, although there seems to be less people on board. Strange I thought but didn't think much more of it and ran back to the other right side of the ferry again. This side now has less people here too. Originally there must have been 100- 150 people on board now its down to about 50, and at this point I was a bit ""wtf going on, where is everybody?"" and I go to check the back of the back of the boat only find nobody here either. When I turn around I see a man that I immediately assume to be Monroe. He had scruffy hair, wearing dirty jeans and a singlet that looks like its covered in dried blood, giving me a death stare. A serial killer death stare. I should have been afraid at this point but I wasn't and I ran like hell and jumped aboard and into the sea. He followed.. My lungs are half full of air and I dive trying to get away from him. He follows. I dive deeper. But he is faster and just before he could catch me i grab the nearby rope (anchor rope), to help me climb up to the surface quickly. He grabs the rope too but due to his speed and momentum, he grabs the rope below me. I felt the tremor in the rope as he grabbed it and my instant reaction was to get out my long bladed knife from its holster in the back of my belt and cut the rope. The tension by the anchor immediately pulls him down to about 20 or 50 meters down, and i could see him desperately trying to get to the surface. I get to surface as fast as i could take a deep breath of fresh air....
and that's when I woke up.  ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f1ynk/i_had_this_strangely_vivid_dream/

",1294964696,"The Midnight Undertaking

[ezdrb](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ezdrb/lets_play_the_midnight_game_gentlemen)
and [f1lgk](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f1igk/first_and_foremost_im_alive) has my interest in the midnight game peaked. So I have a plan to create a film for my final year of high school. 3 teenage males will test not only their pride but also their minds, spirituality and understanding of reality. 

The filming will take place at my friends cottage on an island -- we will have the cottage to ourselves but not the island (we have neighbours) The 3 hours will be interrupted by 3 tasks, one at 12:30, 1:30, 2:30, that will be completed by one of us alone. We will choose at random at 12am by drawing straws.

Now any ideas on the tasks, tips on doing the game with a small group or anyone willing to talk me out of it? 

Edit. 
I'm seriously thinking that this will kill us mentally. I'm very jumpy just reading this thread and making plans.

Task One:
Only God can help you now. Alone, retrieve the pagan cross you foolishly left on the boat. Run, as fast as you can but God help you if you fall or stray from the path. Go now!

Task Two:
This ends now. Enter the bathroom and look deep into the mirror. Demand the man makes a decision by speaking the commands at the bottom of this. If your lucky he will spare you and grant you amnesty for the crimes of your life -- but if you are not he will take you to hell and the others will be have amnesty for your arrogance. 
    Man of the night I demand you make a decision or leave me be. 
    Man of the night I demand you make a decision or leave me be. 
    Man of the night I demand you make a decision or leave me be. 
Now blow out the candle and count to 15.
He's made his decision - relight the candle. 

Task Three:???

Again, any help on the technically side or experience will be awesome. 

Shit -- audio is gonna be a huge pain in the ass.

9,Monkeying around at Monkey's Uncle,1294963888,"Although I love the ""Everything is true"" rule of this subreddit, and thoroughly enjoy all of the stories, whether or not I believe them to be authentic;  I would like to state that this (as well as all of my personal accounts here) are absolutely true to the best of my recollection.

After work in a local Jacksonville Beach, Florida restaurant, two of my co-workers and I went out for a pitcher of beer at a local watering hole called ""The Monkey's Uncle"".

It was early in the afternoon, and the bar was empty, with the exception of the bartender and the three of us. Halfway through the first pitcher, I excused myself to the Ladies room. A few moments later, I returned and sat back down next to the two guys.

Not long afterwards, the guy next to me expressed that he needed to visit the Mens room. As he got up from his bar stool he lost his balance and was forced forward (to catch himself) on the bar. The other guy and myself looked at him in surprise, as none of us had drunk enough to warrant impairment.

He looked down in astonishment (and our eyes followed) to see that both of his shoes had been untied and re-tied around the the legs of his bar stool. He was wearing Vans canvas sneakers, and his feet were resting on the rung of the bar stool, with laces neatly tied in bows around the legs of the stool. He jerked his feet away, with the assumption that it was some sort of illusion and that his feet weren't really tethered to the rungs of the stool. The strangest part was that they were tied above the horizontal rung, so there was no way that he could have slipped the legs through his laces.

After a minute or two of astonishment and speculation, I untied his shoes and set him free to go relieve himself. The other guy and I then set about investigating the bar face to find the secret opening the the bartender must have used to access our friend's shoes when no one was looking. We could find no such thing. The bartender soon began to look at us askance, as though he was mistaken in serving us. 

To this day, I am unable to explain how my friend's shoes became mysteriously tied to his bar stool. He wasn't a prankster of any sort, and seemed to be as disturbed by the event as I was.

10,Phantoms in the empty parking lot.,1294959987,"This is a completely true story that happened to me back in 1998.

I'm sure some of you are familiar with the author, Dean Koonz. I was a big fan of his books during my teen year. (Still am to an extent.) So you can imagine how excited I was to hear that his book ""Phantoms"" was being made into a movie. I didn't quite mark the date on my calender or anything like that, but I knew that I would be one of the first ones in the door to see it.

Before I go on, it's important for me explain that I lived only a few blocks from the mall (Marly Station Mall, Glen Burnie MD). To be honest I always thought that it was bigger mall than one would expect to be in an area like ours. It never got really busy there, except on weekends maybe, but as a teenager I considered myself lucky to have a place to go hang out, work, eat, watch movies, even if the place was dead on some nights.

As much as I wanted to make the weekend premier of Phantoms, I ended up missing it. I was still determined to go, so I went ahead and ordered a ticket over the phone for the late night monday showing then packed a few caned cokes in my JNCO jeans and headed out the door.

 The theater ended up being almost empty. Maybe 2 or 3 people besides myself. I took a seat in the middle and watched what I thought to be one of the best and creepiest horror movies I had ever seen to that point. (Note: Besides Dawn of the Dead. Nothing can beat that.) 

The film let out, I guess it was roughly around 12:45 to 1:15 AM. Everything is closed. No one is around. I walk out the back door, the one that is for Employee's only, because it would save me a few minutes walking home.

The exit led to the back parking lot. Try to picture this. it's a decent sized mall, so the lot is pretty big, so all I see is a huge empty lot and beyond that nothing but pitch black woods. The lighting from the parking lot was fairly dim, Most of them were off, some were even flickering. No ambient light or sound from the highway around the front side of the mall bled back here.

It's also cold so I'm shivering slightly as I start walking through this empty parking lot. My goal is to make it to the tree line and then follow that around to the highway. All I can hear is my own footsteps and my own breathing.

Then I see something about 30 feet in front of me. it's sitting in the shadows between the swiss cheese shaped light pattern. It looks to be the size of a small cat. 

I stop. I look. I think it's moving. But it's dark. It's cold. I'm alone. I've just watched a pretty scary film. So it's probably nothing. Nothing but my mind fucking with me.

I think it's probably an empty fast food bag or a crumpled up black tee-shirt. I think it's anything non-living. So I keep walking, determined not to change my course over something so stupid.

I take a few more steps. Did it just move? What the fuck. I stop. I look. It did move. Fuck. Then logic kicks in again. It's windy out. What ever it is, it's not alive.

So I continue walking. And here's where my bad story telling breaks down even farther because I don't know how to describe in a logical coherent order what happened next. This thing, that I was so sure was just paper bag, or whatever, suddenly lunged at me about 4 feet in a matter of seconds. My brain processed this in a split second: The wind had died down right before it happened so I knew it wasn't the wind. At the same time I knew it wasn't a cat, a rat, a possum or anything... normal. I gasped and jumped back and wanted to run but thought it would chase me.

So what did I do? I took a step toward it. Like a boss. 

I was thinking, 'Fuck you, dark scary moving thing in the parking lot.' and 'So this is why people have gone missing around here.'

For each step I took. It seemed to take a step too. Well, not really a step, more like a ""scatter"". It entered the light as I made my way to about 5 feet of it.

No Sleep, let me tell you. What. The. Fuck. This thing... Size of a sewer rat. It was insect like. It had 6 to 8 legs. pretty long Antler-feeler things. The eyes were more like a crab. They were shiny solid black on stocks the were retracted and moved forward. It had wings like a wasp. It's body was covered in a striped black/tan fur. And there were 3 smaller ones huddled next to it!

It must of only been a few seconds that we looked at each other, but I'm telling you it felt like forever. Then suddenly it flapping it's wings and shot off towards the woods at high speed. I assume the smaller ones took off too because all that was left was like a small shiny wet trail on the ground from where it had scampered towards me.

I ran home. I never told anyone about what I saw. Who the hell would believe it? That was the last time I ever went to a late movie at the mall alone, and the last time I ever left past dark without having a ride. And I never saw it again.

I'll close by repeating this story is 100% true. It is the first time I've ever told it. I didn't pre-write this. I'm not going to edit it for grammar or spelling. And I'm never going to tell it again. Believe it or don't.

11,"""FUCK THAT.""",1294954802,"Just recently found this board and decided I could share a little incident that happened to me a couple of years ago.

I was still in what the equivalent of junior high is in my country at the time, the school is very close by to my house so when classes were over I'd be home 10 minutes later.
Classes were over really early this particular day and at the time all I could think about was getting home and playing some Counter-strike for the rest of the day. 

I get home, and my room is located the closest to the door. The living room is farthest away and is connected to the kitchen. No one is home and I make my way past the living room and into the kitchen, grab some cereal and go to my room and sit on the computer.

About 2 hours later I hear this weird scratching noise against the wooden floor in the living room(none of the other rooms have wooden flooring), and so I mute the sound from my computer and move slowly out of my room to get a peek down the living room just to make sure what I heard was right. Then it came again, really loud. It sounded like something with claws running across the floor (we have no pets). This panic sets in because I was just there earlier and the noise was getting louder and louder. All I mustered up to do was shout ""FUCK THAT."", run out the door to my house and lock it. The rest of the day was spent at my grandparents' who live a couple of minutes away. 

I called my mom and we went back to the house together. When we went in I walked straight to the living room and there was nothing there. No animal, no monster, no marks, nothing.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f1taa/fuck_that/
12,John's Obsession,1294954123,"This story was told to me by my college friend’s mother, an ex-police officer, who quit the force not long after this case (not because of this particular case, but because she had a baby on the way and Detroit is a dangerous place to be a cop).  Anyway, she was working in semi-rural Detroit outskirts in the mid 80’s-early 90s.  This happened in 1990.  

Neighbors reported hearing a gunshot coming from the house of a weird, reclusive, middle-aged guy.  He had committed suicide.  When my friend’s mom and her partner went to investigate, they noticed he had a ton of books on paranormal events…mainly ghosts and different types of hauntings and theories on how people’s souls get imprinted on a place.  Basically, a lot of the pages that were bookmarked pertained to violent deaths causing strong, “active” hauntings...where you have a chance of the ghost interacting with you as opposed to just seeing a repeated scene from history.  He also had Ouija boards, crystal balls, divining rods, and tons of other things they didn’t even recognize.   

This guy had a partially written manuscript with a lot of other cryptic stuff that they didn’t understand and some deranged ramblings.   He went off on tangents about types of people he hated, etc.  One section talked about how detailed experiments needed to be performed to see if creating hauntings was possible, and how merely documenting them was passive and unscientific.  The guy was clearly unstable.  So my friend’s mom (Officer M. from now on) and her partner are really creeped out but also completely intrigued by the level of this man’s obsession.   While going through his things they also found evidence of a huge stain that had obviously been cleaned, and maybe even bleached a few times, in the carpet.  It was a ~6 ft diameter ring in the carpet that they hadn’t noticed until they cleaned up some of the books and objects and junk laying around.  
Officer M.’s partner also noticed a VHS cassette sitting next to the VCR.  It was weird because it was the only tape he had.  No movies, no recorded TV shows…just the one VHS cassette (and a camcorder on a higher shelf).  The dead guy had no family, the neighbors didn’t even know his name (turned out it was something like John Davis but he actually had quite a few aliases and no driver’s license).   So they brought a couple of the weirder books and the tape back to the station.  Then things got fucked up.  

They popped the tape in fully anticipating it to be a recording of his manifesto or a recorded suicide note.  It wasn’t.   It was a woman sitting in a chair in the middle of his living room.  She was tied up, blindfolded, and hyperventilating.  From offscreen, he kept telling her to calm down and listen to him and that she was being a coward.  He spent several minutes trying to reason with her to stop crying and listen to him.  

Officer M. and her partner freak out and they call in the rest of the guys in the station to come watch and they rewind and start watching again.  Further in the video, she’s crying and screaming “Please…don’t” over and over again, and at one point they think they heard her say “Please, John!!!” but they couldn’t be sure.   So, “John” gets really annoyed and puts a gag in her mouth and ties it around her head and proceeds to calmly give her instructions.  “You can ring the bell when you’re here, it’s easy.”  He says it a few times then picks up this big antique-looking bell that Officer M. recognized from one of the bookshelves.   He cuts the rope tying down the lady’s arm and grabs her hand and makes her hit the bell a few times.  It has a pretty faint sound, and they could still hear her muffled crying.   “You can also turn on and off this light” he grabs her hand again, yanks it up, and makes her grab a pull string light switch that’s dangling above her head.  The light turns out and then on and off a few times as he forces her to pull the string, all the while saying “See? Like this, so easy…barely any energy.”  

The woman was still crying (understandably) inconsolably, and Officer M. and everyone in the station who watched it were so freaked out and felt so bad for this woman.  The video ended when John got annoyed that she wouldn’t stop crying and listen to him, so he turned off the tape.  At one point in the tape, the officers thought he said “Listen, Mar” as in short for Mary or Meredith.  The lieutenant at the station (or whoever ranked above them, I forget) told them they couldn’t discuss this video with the public until they conducted an investigation.  Neighbors didn’t report ever seeing John with a woman.  In the grainy video she’s blindfolded, covering most of her facial features.  She seemed to be in her mid-40’s but that was all they could really tell.  There were no missing persons reports filed matching her description (or any variance of Mary, Marie, Miranda, etc.) and the video was already several years old.  The station didn’t have the resources to devote to the case, due to a really high crime rate in the area, and no other body was found on the property.  The forensics team checked, but there were no traces of blood in the big carpet stain.  I think in the end it got chalked up to domestic abuse, even though whoever she was did not live with him.  

So, after the forensics team had checked the rest of the home and the cleanup crew was taking care of the mess John had made of himself, Officer M. and her partner went back to the home as the cleanup crew was taking off to see if there were any more possible clues as to who this lady was, and grabbed a few more books and things lying around.  One of the guys mentioned that he thought some neighborhood kids kept coming to the door and ringing the doorbell while they were in the bedroom cleaning.  He kept going to check the door but no one was there.  Then he said he felt stupid when another guy on the crew noticed it wasn’t the doorbell, it was a draft blowing the giant bell on the bookcase so it made a faint tinkling noise.  They said the guy had been letting the house fall apart and there were probably some problems with the wiring because the lights kept flickering in the living room.  Officer M. looked up and noticed the pull string of the light in the living room had been cut or broken to only an inch long, so you couldn’t reach it from the floor anymore.   Her partner said as they were leaving the house (they got another call) that he’d picked up the bell when they first been called there a few days before, and it was really heavy.  He didn’t see how a breeze could cause it to ring that easily.  

This case stayed on Officer M.’s mind for years because it was just so bizarre and there were so many unanswered questions about the woman in the video.  Even though she’d seen many other suicides, homicides, hoarders, and disturbing crimes scenes, this one just nagged at her brain and occupied her thoughts more than she wanted it to.  A few years later, she was watching her son on the playground and her mind was wandering back to the case, and she realized what had been bothering her.   John wasn’t just abusing Mar for the hell of it, not in his mind.  She remembered the line in his “manifesto” about the need to perform experiments to force hauntings.  The thought of it completely chilled her and when she got home she picked up the phone and called her partner.  Apparently, the case had been ingrained on his mind as well.  When he went on patrol he’d still occasionally drive past the house, wondering what exactly had happened there.  Officer M. told him her theory:  In the video, John had been trying to impress on Mar that she should do as much as she could to alert him to her presence in the afterlife…after he killed her.  He wanted her to ring the bell and mess with the lights, and he had recorded her before death as evidence and had probably planned to record any paranormal events in his house once she was gone.  They recalled the ringing bell from the draft and the flickering lights.   

Officer M. (or Mrs. M. now, I suppose) told me she’s always wondered if there was a second video hidden in the house, or maybe lost amongst the books and clutter.

13,so this is why I've been getting nosleep for the last few days.,1294953502,"so let me preface by saying that I've only discovered r/nosleep in the last week, but I've always loved reading/watching things that keep me up at night. thing is, while these things freak me out enough to do a flying leap into bed so nothing can grab my ankles, they've never inhibited my ability to sleep. but the other night something unusual happened, that has started screwing with me. 

It was getting late in the evening, around 9:00pm, and I was settling in for an exciting night of movies and reddit I live in a guest house on my grandparents property, but I refer to it as my house/property for simplicities sake. Suddenly, I heard a helicopter flying over head. Now this isn't anything too unusual, as I live near Navy base, and I'm used to hearing jets and planes and helicopters. But then something happened that has never happened before, my entire house started shaking. This helicopter was so low, that it was actually shaking my entire house. 

Now while this was odd, I didn't pay it any mind... that is... until it didn't go away. after around a minute and a half, this helicopter was still over my property, and I had seen a bright light flash past my window. I step outside and took a look, only to realize that this **wasn't** a Navy Helicopter. I had seen those helicopters over and over, and this was not one of them. this helicopter was looking for someone. This was almost entirely black, and was a completely different model from what the Navy uses.

Now again, I wasn't too worried, I figured it was probably just a missing person. But just to be sure, I called my boyfriend. He used to be in search and rescue for this area, and anytime someone goes missing, he gets a text message to help with the search. What he told me made my blood run cold. there were no missing persons in the area. As soon as I hung up the phone I ran and locked all my doors, including the deadbolt on my screen door, which is cast iron and heavy duty.

after about 5 minutes of being over my property, the helicopter moved far enough away that my house was no longer shaking, but I could still hear it. after another 1o minutes I couldn't even hear it. So of course, I started to relax a bit. then I started to freak out again. I could hear the door knob on my door turn. then the door started to shake violently. then it stopped... or so I thought. suddenly I heard banging on my back door, then on my windows. this really worried me as I have very dense, 4 foot wide hedges outside all of my windows whatever was hitting them didn't have normal length arms. I couldn't see what it was since my blinds were down (I have shitty windows, and keeping my blinds down really helps insulate my house), but I was too afraid to look anyway.

I called the police, and learned what was by far the most worrying part of the night. they had no idea why a helicopter would have been there. by the time someone got there, the banging had long stopped. there wasn't anything around to give them an idea of who/what had been hitting my windows and doors, so the cop simply left in the end. nothing new has happened, but I'm still freaked out.

14,A brief exploration,1294952797,"My parents lived near Vanderbilt Air Force Base about five years ago, and my dad liked to explore abandoned installations and such that he found in the desert. I came to visit them once, and while I was there, my dad took me up this long windy road to the top of a mountain. At the top was what I took to be an abandoned missile control or radar facility; it was clearly military in nature and had a copper dome type of thing at the top. When we got there, it was pretty late, and very dark. It wasn't a large installation, and we slowly drove around it, creeping each other out. If you've ever been on a military base, you know pretty much what the building looked like. Bland, angular, white paint with a tootsie roll-brown trim. Everything is concrete or steel. I tried to talk my dad into checking it out with me, but he was not willing. I told him that I wanted to check it out, and he asked me not to go in. Agreeing to this, I got out of the car and walked the twenty something yards to the front door. When I reached the metal front door, I got nervous. It was pretty fucking dark out, and we were a long ways from any other people. I started to reach for the door, when I heard my dad knock on the window from the car. I held up one finger, yelled just a minute, and pulled the door open. Well, to be anti-climatic, it was just a long corridor with paint-peeled walls and rooms off to the sides. I stepped in, but just for a few moments. I wasn't up to exploring it by myself, and I had told my dad I wouldn't even go in, so I left and went back to the car. As we were driving down the mountain, I said sorry for going in anyway, but I had to at least step inside. I admitted that I heard him knocking on the window, but I couldn't resist the temptation. My dad looked at me, and said that he hadn't knocked on the window at all. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f1sj7/a_brief_exploration/

The most I've done Ghost Hunting-wise(is that correct? it looks weird.) is setting my Dad's Sony Camera at one end of a hallway in our house and letting it run on Night Vision for an hour.

But my Mom made me stop it halfway through. :|


I have a digital camera, but it's lacking an SD card right now. I plan to get one for it soon.

Really though, It doesn't pick up any sounds at all. Just silence.
But put it near something with high EMFs and static appears out of nowhere.

But I'm not sure how I should start.
Do I just go to some abandoned place and break in?
Post an ad on craigslist asking if they want me to investigate?
Investigate my home first? (side note: My mom says it's haunted, I've never personally experienced anything. Although she says there is a prescense that trips people in said hallway.)

There is a ""Haunted"" library a few miles from where I live that I wouldn't mind doing.
I've been there a few times on Halloween when it does a ""Ghost Hunt"" tour.

16,Footsteps,1294943747,"I should preface this and mention that my boyfriend, cat, and I live in a house on a residential street. We have a sunroom in the back part of our house that we keep the door open to so our cat can go in and out of that room, but the door outside remains locked. Our grass also hasn't been mowed in quite some time.

My boyfriend and I were fast asleep in our bedroom. Suddenly, I'm woken up with my boyfriend jumping out of bed screaming, ""They're inside!"" He runs into the living room and discovers only the cat, who is meowing constantly. ""I heard footsteps out in the living room."" he muttered as he returned. I just excuse it as creaks in the house and return to sleep.
The next morning I decided to go out in the sun room. I sit down on a chair to read when I notice the sliding door. The cat sits next to it meowing as I discover that the door is ajar. I call for my boyfriend to come and see. I asked him if he had left it like this and he grimly shook his head.

18,thump thump thump,1294933593,"Just discovered this subreddit so I thought I'd share my own story.

About a year ago, I was lying in bed after having just finished reading World War Z (excellent zombie novel). It was the middle of winter, and slightly after midnight. I couldn't sleep, as my mind was still crawling with zombies, so I lay awake staring at the ceiling with the dog snoring away next to me.

Suddenly I heard three loud thumps from the glass of the window across the room. Very hard and very steady. Like someone pounding on the glass with the flat of their hand. The sound scared the piss out of me and woke the dog, who started barking. I sat there trying to reassure him (and myself) that it was OK and there was some sensible reason for it. After a few minutes we both calmed down, he went to back sleep and I followed about half an hour later.

I was woken up in the middle of the night by the same sound. THUMP THUMP THUMP. The sound came from the same window, with the same steady interval between thumps, and just as loud as before. The dog woke and started barking again. Both of us were freaking out, and I couldn't bring myself to turn on the light and go look out the window. The only thing I could think to do was run out into the living room curl up on the couch with the dog, a blanket over both out heads. 

The next morning I woke on the couch feeling exhausted, having slept only intermittently. The dog was sitting at the door to my room looking alert and looking back to me and whining. I went back into my bedroom and looked out the window. There was nothing unusual looking. No marks on the glass or anything. 

My apartment is on the top floor of our building. The fire escape was on the window nearest to the bed, not the one near the window where the sound came from. Whatever had hit the window had had a six story drop beneath it. At a loss for any other explanation, I figured it must have been a bird running into the window. I had no explanation for the fact that it seemed to do so three times in a row, on two occasions, at very steady intervals, and with a sound much louder than could be made by a lightweight creature bouncing off glass. The fact that it had happened late at night, a time when birds aren't typically flying around, I also carefully ignored in my hope for some sane explanation.

Somewhat satisfied with my rationalization, I went to work and felt much better for the rest of the day... that is until one last fact filtered into my mind. It dwelt there for the rest of the work day nagging at me and I rushed home to confirm my suspicions.

Reaching the window again, just as the sun was setting, I saw my troublesome suspicion was accurate. There was a screen on the outside of the window. The noise had very clearly be the sound of the glass being struck.

Whatever had hit the window had to have done so from inside the room.",nosleep,reticulatedspline,/r/nosleep/comments/f1lpi/thump_thump_thump/

24,Subpoena,1294911482,"Of course we all realised how important it was to get our daily dose of pain. We were trainees. We needed to get it done and over with. This is what might save our lives in the future. The designers of the pills had told the administration that the pills did not cause any physical harm; they just “pretended” to cause physical harm.

So it was, after the daily rounds of the grounds, and marksmanship practice, we were all given our 30mg dose of “subpoena” and locked up in cells.

The pill was the first of its kind. It was classified as a sentient drug. Apparently, the more the user consciously stopped the pain; it would doubly redouble its efforts and eventually crush the user’s spirit.
We were never told any of that when we lined up to receive our daily dose for the first day. We were told to swallow the drug, drink water, and proceed to our assigned cabins. They called it cabins back then. Still do, I suppose.

Our cells were all the same. It would take about five minutes for the drug to take effect, which was enough time to check if we had swallowed the drug. Then we proceeded to the sound-proof four-by-four room and quietly (or very loudly, it didn’t make any difference) assumed foetal positions. That’s what I did, so I’m generalising.

After two hours, the drug’s effect would magically vanish, and we’d all be let out of our cells, just in time for lunch.

Every weekend, a few of us would be selected for a thorough full day session, mediated by drips of subpoena. Of course, the trainees would be strapped to a chair, and constantly monitored.

Espionage was tricky business in this age of automated racks, and many of the older spies felt that the intimacy was lost.

That was what O felt too.

She told me that on the fifth day. She approached me and asked me how it went.

I told her that it was alright.

She told me that in this age of automated racks and pills that increased resilience, much of the contact between the victims and the masters was lost. She regretted that.

It was a whole four months later that I actually got to ask her out. Apparently she was a spy.

–

In her apartment, her spacious apartment, there was a hook destined for chains. It took me about ten minutes to warm up, and I started feeling like I was the sentient drug.

She was laughing through her tears as I worked her. It was quite the spectacle. I drank, I smoked and I tortured her.

–

She was broken, and she blurted it all out after my tickler had taken much of her skin and I asked her once.

I laughed and opened her mouth. I dropped four doses for the four days she missed and called HQ.

26,The Blizzard,1294899089,"    
My friend Cricket and her mom, Marie, lived in Mobile, Alabama.  Cricket was the only person who wanted to be my friend when I first moved there as a kid, so I stayed over at her home a lot on the weekends.  This was really fun during the day because she had two dogs, a big yard, and a trampoline, but at night it kind of sucked because her mom didn't have cable TV, let alone a Nintendo.  

In lieu of watching Thank God It's Friday television lineups, Marie would sometimes tell us stories before we had to go to bed.  Several of the stories stuck with me over the years.  One of the scariest ones was told to us after I'd asked Marie, innocently enough, why she lived so far in the south when she was always complaining about the hot weather.  

Marie wiped the sweat off of her face (even though she and Cricket lived in a trailer, their dinky air conditioner still wasn't enough to keep the place cool enough) and told us this story.  

Before the divorce and long before Cricket was born, Marie had moved to Maine with her new husband.  Her husband was a manager for some company that kept him working all the time, so he was almost never home.  Even though Marie had grown up with her parents and older brothers to do the driving, in her new house, she had to rely on herself to get around town.  

That winter, a few months after she'd moved to the new house, Marie noticed that they were out of eggs.  Even though it was snowing outside, the roads hadn't looked *too* bad, so she decided to brave the roads and run down to the grocery store.  About a mile away from the house, two things happened almost simultaneously.  

First, the snow, which had been coming down lightly before, began to thicken into what looked like the beginnings of a serious blizzard.

Second, a deer ran out in front of her car.  

Marie had been driving fast, too fast for this weather, and her wheels hit a patch of ice as she swerved away from the deer.  The car spun, the momentum carrying her over the side of the road, down into a ditch, into a tree.  Marie hadn't been wearing a seatbelt and so she cracked her head on the windshield.  She blacked out.  

Marie didn't know how long she'd been out of it before she awoke.  It was darker, though, but not pitch black.  Maybe it was 4 o'clock, 4:30.  The weather had gotten worse, covering the windshield and windows with snow.  Marie could only see outside through a streak, about a fingertip wide, running across the top of the driver's side window.  

Her head aching, her forehead feeling sticky with blood, Marie struggled to right herself.  The car was still on four wheels, but the car had stopped at a noticeable downward angle.  She pulled herself back into her seat and fumbled for the handle of the car door.  

Marie always told us, Cricket and I, that if she'd been a little less slow with opening the door, she probably wouldn't be alive today.  

Slam!  Before she could grasp the handle, the entire car jerked as though someone had rammed it.  The impact had felt like it had come from the driver's side, so strong that Marie thought that maybe she'd made a mistake and she was still on the road, and that a car had just hit her.  But no, that wouldn't make any sense.  She remembered striking the tree, sliding off the side of the road.  Unless someone else had just slid of the road right next to her, it couldn't have been a car.  

The car was rammed again.  Some of the snow fell of the windows at the impact, but not enough for Marie to clearly see out of them.  She peered from that weird streak at the top of her window - so odd, had someone trailed their finger along it?  That's what it looked like - but there was nothing visible outside.  Just the white of the blizzard, the vague shadows of trees behind it, the rapidly darkening grey of the sky.  

""Who's there?""  Marie called.  There wasn't any answer.  The wind was shrieking through the trees, that high pitched whistle like ghosts moaning from hell, but no voices responded to her call.  The car was struck again.  Softer this time, but the strikes didn't let up.  They were repeated, like something was headbutting the side of her vehicle.  

...Or knocking.  Marie felt the weirdest urge overtake her when the idea occurred.  Someone was knocking outside.  They were injured.  They needed her help.  She had to open up the door herself.  They couldn't just come into the car with her.  No.  She had to *let* them in.  

This was the part that Cricket and I couldn't understand.  Why would whatever, whoever was outside need her permission?  Marie never could explain it properly, no matter how many times we asked, but she never changed the story around with each retelling.  The thing outside her car needed *her* to let it inside.  If she was unwilling, it would have to stay outside forever.  

""But I wanted to,"" she'd tell us, sipping at her omnipresent cup of coffee.  ""Oh lord, I wanted to open that door.""  

The knocking continued as her hand crept closer and closer to the handle of the door.  Maybe there was someone outside who was injured.  Maybe she was right and another car had had an accident.  Sure, no one had responded to her calls, but maybe their vocal cords had been messed up in the crash.  

""Hello?""  Maried called out.  The knocking stopped.  ""I'm opening the door, okay?  I'm letting you inside.""  

There was no response.

With numb fingers, Marie slid her hand over the car handle and pulled it open the door.  Nothing happened.  Marie frowned before realizing that the locks were still pressed down.  Of course the door hadn't opened.  

""Oh, shoot.  Sorry,"" she muttered, fumbling with the little 'antenna' lock, trying to pull it up, when suddenly whatever was outside slammed into the side of the car so hard that she felt the driver's side wheels lift up from the ground a few inches before falling hard back onto the snow.

Her forehead still caked with dried blood, her car cold and rapidly growing colder, Marie sat in the front seat of her car, crying, wishing that she'd picked a better traveled road to take to the damn grocery store.  

Slam!  Again, her car jolted.  Then again.  Then nothing for a half an hour.  Then again, another jolt as something (there was no 'someone' at this point, Marie told us.  That illusion had passed.  Whatever was outside the car, it wasn't human) rammed itself into the side.  

For almost fourteen hours, this went on.  Sometimes, there'd be an interval of a few hours before the car would be attacked again.  Other times, every few minutes.  The thing never attacked the passenger side of the door, only the driver's side, but Marie kept the locks down and she wasn't tempted again to let whatever was outside in the blizzard inside of her only refuge.  She never saw what it was through the streak in the glass.  She never heard it break, or howl, or make a sound aside from the attacks on her car.  

A patrolling police officer found her in the morning, huddled in her winter coat with her fingers buried near her armpits for warmth.  She hadn't slept all night.  Her car was so cold that the trails of her tears had frozen on her cheeks.  She had frostbite and was hypothermic, but she refused to step outside of her car until the officer showed her his gun and promised to shoot anything that attacked.  

Before Marie let him help her out of the ditch and up to his patrol car, she turned and looked at the side of her vehicle that had been assaulted all night by a strange, invisible something.  

Marie would pause then, forcing Cricket and me to ask, ""What was there?  What did you see?""  

She would lean forward, her dark eyes intense as she stared at us with absolute conviction.  ""Slime.""  

There were numerous dents in the doors, but everything on the driver's side was covered with a thin coating of some slimy liquid.  It was clear, but had a vague rusty smell.  When Marie touched it with a gloved hand, it glistened on the fabric like oil and wouldn't come off the material.  When she threw the glove in the washer, the entire thing had unraveled into yarn by the time it had been through the rinse cycle, as though it had been deconstructed.  

As soon as she and her husband had divorced, Marie had moved as far south as she could without leaving the United States.  Before that time, she'd made her husband drive and she'd never, ever left the house without a gun in the glove compartment of her new vehicle.  She'd made sure to never be caught in a blizzard again.  

""That's where it lives,"" she'd told us.  ""In the blizzards, waiting in the white.""  Whenever you see a news report about an abandoned car discovered after a major snowfall, Marie told us, that was when she knew that the creature had struck again.  Those poor people had done the thing that she had not; they'd opened the door and invited it in.  

The thing in the blizzard was often hungry.  ",nosleep,Delfishie,/r/nosleep/comments/f1e5x/the_blizzard/

Panicking she ran to a neighbors  house and called 911. The police arrived, and after a thorough search of the house and surrounding area, did not find anyone. However they did have some disturbing information for the girl. The ""window"" she was looking in when she saw the man was actually a mirror, therefore, the murderer was in the house the entire time.

42,Old Hag Syndrome  (Sleep Paralysis),1294865021,"This is a re-post of a comment I made in someone's thread about alien abductions and sleep paralysis.

I have ""Old Hag Syndrome"". In my experience I wake up paralyzed in the dark, I sense a malevolent Evil presence in the room that wants to kill me and I can see an impossibly old and terrifyingly ugly woman crouching in my closet across the bed staring at me. Remember the demonic witch in Evil Dead? Yeah, that bad. I desperately try to move a finger, a toe or blink but ... nothing. My body is unresponsive.

The Old Hag then stands up and starts to walk toward the bed very slowly. The entire time I try to gain control of my body but nothing is responding. The Old Woman then climbs on the bed and sits on my chest. The witch then wraps her hands around my throat and begins to strangle me. The entire time she is choking me her face is just beyond my peripheral vision but I instinctively know she is beyond hideous.

Sometimes I then wake up from this terrifying scenario at the brink of losing consciousness because of the strangulation but I am still paralyzed. I am not fully awake. I still sense her Evil in the room and she is sitting on the floor beside my bed and I can hear her breathing,smell her foul stench and feel her stare upon my face. She then crawls back on the bed and begins choking me again. I think that she only did this to make me more scared. 

If I'm lucky I then wake up for real and check my house for this bitch with a baseball bat. This happens to me when I'm under a lot of stress and the full attack happened only after minor episodes of sleep paralysis that got worse in intensity each time.

http://paranormal.about.com/od/humanenigmas/a/Old-Hag-Syndrome.htm

I think that if this is a supernatural being that it lives off fear. The more terror I felt the more it would interact with me.  Lately Ive read that the ""Old Hag type SP usually only happens to people from the NE U.S. Ive never lived in the NE. Mostly Ive lived in the SW (New Mexico). I also read that Alien type SP only happens in the U.S. Anyone else met the old hag?

My boyfriend wants to try the game, but my concern is this: If one believes in energies both good and bad, and believes that those can manifest themselves in various ways including ""demons"", ""spirits"", whatever...is this game really a good idea? You hear the stories about people playing with Oujia boards or attempting to do ""magic"" and ""spells"" when they know nothing about it, and then ending up accidentally inviting some crap into their homes and lives that they can't easily get rid of. Even if the point of the Midnight Game is to just scare yourself and you know that if you see anything it's more than likely due to hallucinations from sleep deprivation and fear, is it worth the risk of inviting something in? Blood, candles, all that shit. I don't know. Just a thought. Right now I'm leaning toward asking him to do it when I go out of town in a couple of months, rather than participating in it myself.

It immediately brought me back to my childhood.  
Although many claim to have experienced ""night terrors"" I am led to believe that many of the claims are diagnosed into a nightmare category for they are simply very horrifying dreams, but the other physical symptoms to classify a ""terror"" are lacking.  
That being said, I make no mistake when I say that I  suffered constantly with them while I was a child.  In summation... They are the most horrifying experiences that I have ever had, let alone imagined having!  
I'll pain you a picture of my dream - 
I'm laying in bed, having a peaceful sleep.  I am never uncomfortable, never with anxiety, nothing short of relaxed and loving every minute of it.  That is until I feel something brush my leg.  Not wanting to move I assume it's in my head and simply roll over.  I quickly fall back asleep.  There it is again, only definitely more pronounced this time.  Again, too relaxed to be bothered to check so I growl my cat for being in the bed and go back to sleep.  It's then that I feel it.  I'm jolted.  That is definitely not the cat.  The cat doesn't crawl.  The cat isn't that light.  Dragging myself out of my ""sleep"".  I pull back the covers to inspect what's going on.  At first I'm in shock.  I can't believe that I'm seeing.  I must be dreaming right?  My legs are immediately swarmed with hundreds of spiders.  I pinch myself.  I try to wake up.  I can't wake up!  It's real!  OMFG it's REAL!  I immediately jump up in bed and start screaming and flailing my arms trying to brush them all off.  I think I'm successful so I jump to the floor.  Just then I catch a glimpse of something dark from the corner of my eye.  I swear I saw something black move.  I turn on the light and I see them.  Thousands of black crawlers coming from every seam in my room.  They sneak through the cracks between the ceiling panels, the baseboards, the corners of the room.  Within minutes they are everywhere.  I'm in shock.  I scream.  I cry for someone to help me.  Then I have a brilliant idea!  The door is covered in them and I dare not go near it, BUT the window is clear!  It's dark outside of course, so it looks black, but I don't see any critters on the window!  I make a mad dash for the window.  DAMNIT I can't get it open!  Quickly grabbing the chair to prop myself up to get a better grip, and I finally feel the pressure release.  The window is moving!  I'm saved!  I can't believe I'm saved!  I'm free!  I look back for one last ""is this real"" look and when I face the window again I'm literally knocked to the ground with the blast of incoming spiders covering my body.  They pour in the window as if by force and they engulf my body.  I can't breath.  They're crawling on my face, up my nightdress, everywhere.  I can't breath.  I try desperately to push them off of me.  I can't breath.........
This is all I remember.  My parents tell me that I always sat up in bed and had my eyes open during this.  I never saw them, never remember them being in my room through the night, nothing.  They were never able to fully wake me.  Some times I would simply sit there with my eyes open, then start gasping for breath, then I'd lay back down and continue sleeping as if nothing happened.  Other times I'd seem as if I was awake for I'd be standing in the corner of my bed screaming.  Sometimes just standing there, other times I'd be flailing my arms around.  Pretty scary to witness as a parent I imagine!  
I actually broke my dad's nose once while he was trying to calm me down.  I don't remember.  ",nosleep,immachicklette,/r/nosleep/comments/f0za6/sleeping_with_thousands_of_spiders/
47,Going Ghost Hunting (Mansfield Reformatory) Need Tips. ,1294844163,"To start off I hope that this is in the right sub-reddit. Any who, I've known my current girlfriend for over 2 years now and I've always joked about going ghost hunting somewhere, but this year for Christmas she surprised me with two tickets to go ghost hunting at the **Ohio State Mansfield Reformatory**. 
At first I really wasn't sure if I would like to go but now I see it as a once in a life time opportunity. I didn't know what I was getting myself into until my girlfriend forwarded me some pictures one of her coworkers took while he was there. [one](http://i.imgur.com/mM0jO.jpg) [two](http://imgur.com/fMC2u) 
Now I'm shatting bricks because that stuff looks something straight out of a Silent Hill game. I have 4 months until I'm going there so the ultimate question is what do I have to do to prepare my self for this adventure? Does anyone have any tips for what I should bring? I already started to make a mental list of stuff I'm going to bring Flashlights,water,a crappy video camera and some back up batteries. Also does anyone know of any hot spots there, or had any experiences there?  I'm already planning on posting with updates after I come back, but that is four months down the road. So I'm really just asking for some advise from you guys!",nosleep,Weft_,/r/nosleep/comments/f0ws4/going_ghost_hunting_mansfield_reformatory_need/

49,It's going on right now...,1294834197,"So I'm just laying in bed trying to sleep when I notice a strange light outside my room's door and then it just disappeared. It wasn't bright enough to be the kitchen light which is across from my room and I didn't hear any switches being switched. 

Then in full surprise, I hear the fucking cookie monster singing followed by Elmo's laughter. These are my niece's toys going on in the middle of the night and this has scared the crap out of me. The main thing is that the cookie monster toy doesn't talk unless you open it's mouth wide open until it touches the table it is placed on. Then for Elmo you have to press a button for him to speak, same for Bert which later joined the conversation of whatever the fuck was going on. The last thing heard was the cookie monster singing again and Elmo saying, ""Shut up cookie monster."" Dead Fucking Serious! 

Everything went calm when someone came out to see what was going on and when I went to join whoever was outside they were already back in their room closing their door. It was probably my brother-in-law turning the toys off but I just felt this chill standing there in the dark with these toys so I climbed back in bed as fast as I could. 

So here I am, laying in bed and noticing that the light from before is back. Sorry about this, I'm just scared shitless and just need to tell someone since everyone else is asleep and I'm too scared to even make a sound.

50,A week of sleep paralysis.,1294827389,"Decided I should share a quick story from several years ago:

During my freshman year of high school, my mother decided to buy this creepy ass house in one of the most crappiest parts of town. If I remember right, this was either the first week of our stay or one of the earlier weeks. For about a week, I had sleep paralysis. Two dreams stick out the most to me as they are the most vivid, despite happening about 7 years ago.

The first dream: I was watching some crappy movie in my sister's room, and I fell asleep. I was lying on her bed facing the open bedroom door. In my dream there was this bulky, grey entity that hovered into the room. I do not think I have ever been more terrified in my life then I was at that point in time. I could not move. I could not scream. The entity moved closer to the bed. I remember feeling as though the gravity in the room was increasing dramatically to the point where I passed out in the dream and woke up to a closed door.

The second dream: A few days later, I had a dream in my bed. In the dream, I am struggling in my bed to move. It got to the point where I could not move, and my shouting for help was completely silent. I felt nauseous in my dream. I wanted to move so badly. I wanted to be heard, but there was something holding me down. Holding my voice down. I left my body and looked down at the face of something I can only describe as demonic. It had completely taken over me. It smiled at me right before it screamed as loud as it possibly could. I woke up finishing this scream, soaked in sweat.

“What’s here?” asks she.
	
“The hollow one. The empty one.”
	
“The big male?” asks she. “Or the skinny female?”
	
“The male,” answers he. “He is telling the little one of us again.”
	
“That we wait? That we are hungry?”
	
“No, that we don’t exist. That we aren’t real. That his closet is safe, and that we can’t fit under his bed. That we are figments sister. Figments!”
	
“I’m so hungry brother. I’ve lost half my scales…”
	
“The nerve of them! We are older, stronger, and wiser, while they are weak-willed and fragile. They kill for fun and we kill only to eat, and we are called the monsters?”
	
“…my claws are brittle and I can hardly stand.”
	
“What? No my sister, you must be strong. We are the last, but we won’t be for long; just hold on a little longer. We will feed and they will be forced to believe in us.”
	
“…”
	
“Sister?”

“It’s too late brother… I’m fading. Soon they will be right. I will become a figment, an imaginary thing. I will join the dragons and the Cyclops if another world truly does exist beyond this one.”
	
“You can’t leave me sister! I need you. I’m not strong enough to exist on my own.” 
	
“I’m sorry brother, but you need to dry you tears. I was a queen once; let me go with the dignity I have left.”
	
“Don’t… wait… do you hear?”
	
“Perhaps we will be together again in the next life brother. A life where we are as regal as we deserve, but if there is nothing awaiting me I content myself to an eternal rest where the pangs of hunger are no longer felt.”
	
“Do you hear sister? The branch of the tree outside scrapes against the young one’s window. Can you hear his pulse quicken? Can you see his eyes? Wide and dilated? Can you feel the heat from his rapid breaths? I can smell the sweat sister!”
	
“Faintly brother, but he calls for the empty ones, and we can’t hurt them. With their science and their guns, they are faithless, trusting only what they see.”
	
“But look! They do not come; he is alone.”
	
“It matters not, they aren’t afraid of us anymore.”
	
“One of them is, and that’s all we need.”
	
“Perhaps…” hopes she.
	
“It will be enough,” says he. “When the older one hears his scream she will find what we leave behind.”
	
“The bones,” laughs she, “for I am awfully hungry.”
	
“And his sister will know we exist,” snarls he, “and the empty ones will be able to do nothing.”
	
“Will I be beautiful again?” asks she.
	
“You will be stunningly terrifying,” assures he. “Cleanse your pallet and sharpen you fangs, my sister, for tonight we feast on man.”

55,"Hey r/nosleep, genuinely freaked the fuck out right now.",1294806773,"Alright, here's the deal. I'm a pretty active guy and went for a two mile run roughly 3 hours ago. After I got home, I went up to my room on the 3rd floor and laid down on my computer for a while. Fast forward to just now, I decided to browse Amazon I glace at the ""you viewed"" page.

Notice the text on the packaging. Now, I was *not* shopping for a garage door monitor, I didn't even know that those things fucking *existed.*  Well, now I'm a little paranoid and go down to check the garage to see if I left it open. I go downstairs, and the garage door *and* the door into the house are wide fucking open.

Jesus. Fuck.

I'm shitting my pants right now. I searched my house (found nothing) and am locked in my room with my shotgun.

*Fuck.*

Edit: Reasonable explanation found, although it's still a damn big coincidence.

Edit; Ha, I thought I would let you guys stew in the mystery for a while. Anyway, the explanation is that I had just intsalled a Chrome extension called invisible hand that tells you if you're getting the best price available for an item online. Apparently when it checks, it puts those items in your ""recently viewed"". After figuring this out, I checked to see what else it added. I had searched the internet looking for some heavy chains for my workouts, and one of the links was a garage door mechanism. Accidentally click on the link, and the invisible hand app ""sees"" an item in the related products about the garage door monitor, and that places it in my recently viewed.

So all in all, it's just one, big, creepy coincidence.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f0ooz/hey_rnosleep_genuinely_freaked_the_fuck_out_right/
56,My old house may have been haunted?,1294805189,"I like to think of myself as a reasonable, rational person. I try to find some sort of sense behind anything superstitious that most people claim to have had happened to them.


There wasn't anything out of the ordinary at my old home. I lived with my family of seven (yikes, right?), so it was a nice, big house, and I got the privilege of having the biggest bedroom.


When we moved in, there wasn't much in the way of lighting, so I got one of those nice little lamps that you tap the base of to turn it on. It had the usual settings: one tap to have a dim light, another for slightly brighter, a third for brightest, and the final one would turn it off.


Not long after getting the lamp, it'd turn itself on and off pretty often. I figured it was faulty, or there was something leaning on it, or, you know, something reasonable. The idea of anything superstitious never really crossed my mind.


My siblings are all pretty rational when it comes to this sort of thing, too. I have four younger sisters, all of us two years apart, and we'd occasionally have ""sleep-overs"" in my room. We'd buy candy and rent movies and all that jazz. Bonding times.


The first time we did this in my new bedroom, my two youngest sisters, (they were ages 10 and 8 at the time), woke me up sobbing hysterically. When I asked what was wrong, the 10-year old would refuse to tell me, but the youngest simply said, ""We got scared!"" and took off. One other sister was awake, but hadn't said anything, and we went back to sleep.


My sisters didn’t want to sleep in my room any night after that, and I figured they were growing up. We never brought it up; never thought anything of the night they‘d gotten freaked out. The only other really ""odd"" things that would happen in that room would be my fan falling over a lot, whether it was on or not, but it wasn't a big deal. It's an old, unsteady fan.


Well, we eventually moved out and into a much nicer home, just down the street. (We went from renting to owning. The location was just convenient). While packing up, the conversation was steered to the sleep-overs we’d have. My youngest sister, now 10 years old, said, “Did you ever see the girl in your room?”
“What girl?”
“There was a girl who would be there sometimes.”
The older sister nodded. “That’s why we hated your room so much!”
Another sister, the one who’d woken up but never said anything, nodded in agreement, too. “She threw your fan over that one time. It still falls over all the time! You really never saw anything?”


Nope. I never saw anything. :| It all seemed like a random unrelated events, but put together it creeped me out.

I understand they're young and could all just be lying about it and crap, but none of us brought any of the weird stuff up to each other, because we all tried rationalizing the odd things that'd happen in that room. We all kept puzzle pieces secret until we put it together to form a creepy story.

57,Story from my childhood.  I wish I could forget it.  Time to share with others.,1294804299,"When I was young, whenever the lights when out, I would see things in my room move slightly as my eyes adjusted.  I became used to this.  I distinctly remember the flowers on the hat of one of my dolls would move, as if there were a breeze.  I knew it was just my brain.  Eventually I would block it out and fall asleep.

I would also see figured in the doorway.  It would happen when I was scared.  I would desperately want one of my parents to come in my room, and I was see their silhouette.  It would stay there until I spoke, and then it would be gone.  The last time I saw this, I was fifteen.  I was incredibly upset, in the dark, and I heard my dog's ID tag jingle, as if she were coming up the stairs.  I saw her silhouette come around the corner of my bed, and as I reached out to pet her, she was gone.  Thankfully I haven't seen anything like this since (I'm 28 now).  I don't miss it.

One night, when I was 12, I saw a figure.  This time, instead of being dark, it was very bright.  My bedroom door was open, and I saw through the hallway through to the dining room (we lived in a single-floor ranch at the time).  The figure was sitting on a small sofa in the dining room.  From a distance, it appeared almost skeletal, with an aura.  I spoke quietly, but it didn't go away.  I closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but every time I looked back, it was still there.

I decided I was brave (a brave 12-year-old) and that I would approach it.  Up close, it would certainly go away.  My alarm clock had a little flash light that was part of it, so I picked it up and started inching closer to the figure.  I still saw it when I reached the hallway.  It was definitely skeletal.  I stepped into the dining room, and it was still there.  I inched closer and stopped at about five feet from it.  It seemed to be staring at my parents' bedroom door, unmoving.  There were just eye sockets, no eyes.  It was sitting upright and was rather small, maybe a small man's skeleton.  I stared at it.  It went nowhere.

I ran as fast I could back to my room and slammed the door, jumping under the covers.  My door slowly opened - maybe, because I slammed it, it didn't close properly.  I looked out of the door, and still, the figure was there.  I covered my head and stayed under the covers, somehow falling asleep.  I was shaken the next day, to say the least.

I know everything else I saw - the black figures - were in my mind.  This figure seemed different.  I never saw anything like that again.  I still don't know what to attribute it to.  There's a part of me that's still bothered.",nosleep,joannchilada,/r/nosleep/comments/f0ny2/story_from_my_childhood_i_wish_i_could_forget_it/

59,"My families experiences in a ""haunted house"".",1294792273,"The house was in Detroit and my family lived there in the early 1980's. The only thing I personally remember from living in the house, is having frequent, recurring nightmares, even though I was only three years old at the time. I still remember the nightmares, it was always about going into the basement and everything was dark. There was an evil grandfather clock at the end of the stairs and that's all I personally remember.

I'd like to preface the rest by stating I am personally a skeptic, regarding all things supernatural. The following information was told to me by members of the family who lived there at the time: My father, mother, two brothers and an uncle who frequently came over. Even though I believe they're sincere in their stories and I'm certain they personally believe what they have said, I do not believe in ghosts, demons, etc.

So to the stories, to begin with, there are the usual stories about doors shutting by themselves, people hearing their names being called when nobody was there, knocking on doors and walls, with nobody there, footsteps being heard, etc. Sometimes an individual would experience an episode alone, sometimes multiple people would have experiences at the same time. Many people claim to have even seen presences, although I don't remember the descriptions, except one...

My parents claim one night, they were sleeping in separate rooms, for reasons I'm unaware. My father was sleeping in my room and my mother across the hall in their room. Perhaps they had a fight or something, I don't know. My mother claims that while trying to sleep, she looked above her and there, floating was a dark figure, right above the bed. It was human shaped and quite long. My mother closed her eyes and started praying (Christianity), when she opened her eyes again, the presence was gone.
She immediately arose and opened the door, only to see my father there. They soon began to explain to each other, that they had both experienced the same phenomenon, at the same exact time, in different rooms. They both saw the same dark figure, floating above their respective beds, prayed, the figure disappeared and they got up and met in the hallway. They 100% believe that they saw this and I believe they're being honest. I do NOT believe in ghosts, demons, etc, so I have no explanation for it, other than
some strange coincidence, strange lighting, strange mindset, etc.

I have never seen anything, that I am aware of. However, I have had some strange experiences, that I cannot really explain. To begin with, I have had Déjà vu type experiences, where I have seemingly seen in advance, something take place before it actually happened. One example was a time I was selling tickets to a hockey game with my, then girlfriend. We were sitting at a long table and there was a concession stand on the other side of the lobby. I saw a couple walking towards the table carrying beverages. I saw the woman set her cup on the table and I saw it spill, but they hadn't even made it to the table yet. I stood up and got out of the way and sure enough, when the lady got to the table, she set the cup down and spilled hot chocolate all over the table and the seat where I was sitting.

Another example, I was due to have a medical procedure and a painful one which I would need to be awake for. I prayed before the procedure and as they were about to begin the procedure, which was being done guided by a concurrent session of CT scans, the anomaly, which was there the day before, was gone. It was quite large and it just disappeared. The radiologist himself said to me and I quote ""you must have prayed to the right god"" ( I never told him I prayed at all).

I don't know, take it however you want. I'm skeptical myself and there are so many examples of odd things occurring. I'm just not sure what to make of it all.

61,"Hey r/NoSleep, I'd like to share what happened to me last night...",1294786756,"I actually don't know if it really happened, but I find it interesting:

So there I was minding my own business sleeping, but at a time I did not check I felt something that started walking on my bed, towards my face. So I wake up, see nothing and then suddenly something grabs me by my shirt. I couldn't see what it was but then I heard something say in a woman's voice, ""Scream for me"", and oh I tried to scream, but nothing was coming out of my mouth. I don't know if I closed my eyes or something but I couldn't see what was grabbing me...so I realized that if ""it"" could grab me I could totally punch it (silly me), and so I tried it, but to no avail since I was paralyzed by the fear.

I dunno what happened afterwards, I guess I blacked out? Then again it seemed too surreal to be true. My guess is it was a dream, since the thing I probably felt walking on my bed was my dog since I woke up in the morning and he was on the bed. If it was actually my dog then I hate my brain for playing tricks on me :(.

62,Feet,1294783115,"It was a fear I'd had since I was a small child.The thought of some unnamed horror grabbing my feet from under the bed. I think its a primal fear, something embedded in some eternal zeitgeist of humanity. It's why I always make sure my bedsheets are tucked under the mattress. That thin layer of Egyptian cotton seems to calm the terror lurking in the pit of my stomach, of cold, dead things pulling me down into the shadows. My rational mind explained this fear away. I don't really listen to it anymore.

It happened as I lay in bed on that warm June night, blankets and sheets kicked to the floor in a sleepy attempt to cool off. I awoke. Something, some thing, was touching my foot, or more specifically my big toe. My heart raced as I jerked my foot away. I sat up in bed and glanced down, expecting to see my doom. Instead, I was greeted to my schnauzer staring lazily up at me from the floor. She enjoyed sleeping under the bed. I breathed a sigh of relief. She must have jumped up and pawed my foot. That's all. I scolded her. In my embarrassment I banished her to the living room. Promising that she wouldn't do that to me again. 

The next night I scolded my dog and told her to stay in the living room. She sniffed once in disdain and settled on the couch. I went to bed, and soon fell into a restless sleep, blankets kicked to the floor once again. Then I felt it. This time I was prepared. I sat up growling in my best scolding voice, ""Listen mutt, I told you to stay.."" my reprimand cut short as my blurry vision began to focus on what stood at the edge of my bed. I choked in fear, paralyzed by what I saw. 

The thing stood around 4 feet tall. The moonlight from the window casting it in a pale light. Grayish blue skin, disheveled black hair, wrinkled face and pointy ears. One dirty, sharp nail dug into my big toe, and blood trickled onto my sheets. It spoke, an almost musical tenor, underscored by a faint sound like tires over wet gravel, ""You'll receive no revelations from me, child. Your flesh was denied once already and it shan't be denied again."" With that the creature leaped on top of me, a cruel dagger slashing my face. I was pinned to my bed as the creature licked the blood from my open wound with its purplish black tongue. The creature was icy in its touch. Even its tongue. I could not resist. There was no fighting back. I wailed inside my mind and terror overtook me.

It held my head down and I felt the creature trace its blade down my abdomen leaving a red wet line of pain as it went. ""I'll eat your appendix first. Wouldn't want that heart to stop beating yet."" Whatever power the monster held over me broke long enough for me to let out a momentary yelp as he sliced into my abdomen.  The pain became too great and I began to lose consciousness. As sound and light and began to fade out I heard a growl and a howl of rage.

I woke up some time later. Dried blood covered my sheets and the deep wound in my abdomen still leaked. In a panic I looked around and saw my dog sitting by my bed, licking my hand. A trail of black liquid lead to my now shattered window. A warm summer breeze billowing the curtains out. I rubbed my dogs head and as my hand brushed past her muzzle I encountered more of the black ooze that trailed out the window. I reached down and hugged my dog before dialing 911. ""Good girl Goblin."", I said. She licked my face, and as I passed out from the blood loss, I heard sirens faintly in the distance...",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/f0hdo/feet/

   There is no feeling like that of unadulterated fear. It’s a bittersweet kind of feeling for me. I want out of the situation ASAP, but at the same time, I can’t help but love it. The following was different. I felt no joy. I wanted out. I have some logical theories to explain away the following story, but none of them feel quite right. Possibly theories would be greatly appreciated.

   There is an abandoned house on a frontage road in my town of Darien, Illinois. It is covered by overgrown trees and bushes and is only visible in the deepest winter when all the leaves have left the trees. Unlike many ""haunted"" houses, Boar's Nest is in between two residences both of which are inhabited by regular working families. Across the street is my junior high as well as a rather affluent neighborhood. It’s definitely not in Bufu. My sophomore year of high school I did a photography project on this rotting structure. I never went inside (much too frightening), but I walked around the outside snapping shots with my long outdated Nikon. Nothing struck me as odd aside from the open shed practically spewing 1950's looking tools and the push-mower sitting in the middle of the lawn, as though someone had stopped their yard work suddenly. Only after developing these photos 2 weeks later did I get the urge to venture inside. 

   ""Boar's Nest"" is a nickname that was given to the house by the high school kids that get drunk and smash its windows. Though there is no proof, the kids swear by the rumor that Boar's Nest was once a bar that was burned down due to a crooked owner and his insurance purposes. Before that, Boar's Nest was home to a humble 1800's family. The story goes that the husband's business failed, sending him into a deep depression. Not knowing where to turn, he hung himself on the third floor. Upon finding him, the wife went mad and set fire to the house. In her final moment of clarity, she remembered her six-month-old son, and decided she didn't want that fate for him. But it was too late. The flames had risen, trapping mother and son in the house. Firemen only found burned remains of the three bodies. The house sat, half incinerated, for fifty years until a bar owner found it and thought it perfect for his new pub.

   Unfortunately, I hadn't heard about that rumor until after I took my adventure.

   The sun is going down and it’s cold, and my boyfriend practically drags me from the car after I proposed that maybe another day would be better to explore the house. Before I know it, we're standing at the back of the house with old school flame lanterns. The house is huge. Three or more stories loom above us as the groaning and creaking can barely be heard over the screaming of highway traffic behind us. Regardless of what caused the fire, the structure is definitely burned.  The first story of the house is still intact, but everything else is burnt, cracked and falling. My boyfriend wastes no time and calmly moves his way through a shattered basement window. I anxiously stand and wait like a child waiting for someone’s hand to cross the street. I bend down and look in. Shards of glass, broken wood, and singed articles of clothing cover the floor. There is a half burned, dilapidated baby’s crib in the corner. This didn’t frighten me much until I heard the supposed story of the origin of Boar’s Nest. I call out to my boyfriend, but the darkness responds with silence. I take a deep breath and step onto the cracked frame. Hunched over, I topple down the pile of stuff on the inside. There is dust and the smell of old campfire everywhere. I hear creaking on the floorboards above me and call out my boyfriend’s name again. Nothing. I look around. There’s a shit ton of mirrors and they’re just not helping my level of scared. Stacks of books and old newspaper line the walls. There are five doors to different rooms that all lead to eerie darkness. The entrance to the first floor is light enough to just barely see. I head toward it when suddenly a shadow passes above the top step. One more call out to my boyfriend. Again, nothing. Aaand that’s my cue. I quickly climb back up the pile of stuff and maneuver through the frame. Standing at least twenty feet from the house, I wait about thirty seconds until my boyfriend jumps out. To this day I have no idea what happened in the five minutes or so that he was in the house before running out, grabbing my hand, and power walking us back to the car. He only told me that he saw the words ""Boar's Nest"" painted across the ceiling in one of the basement rooms. He was in the basement? I don’t want to ask but I do anyway. 
   “Weren’t you upstairs?”
   “No” he says, “I was in the first room on the left in the basement”. 

   What the fuck? What the fucking shit fucks? As I open my mouth to repeat my thoughts out loud, we are stopped in our tracks. A high pitch, blood-curdling shriek lasts for five seconds, and ends with a whimper. As much as we don’t want to believe it, the scream came from an upper story of the house. I am frozen to the spot. My boyfriend squeezes my hand and I start hysterically laughing for God knows what reason. He looks at me and says, “What the fuck was that?” to which I hurriedly respond, “IdunnoIhavetopiss.” We ditch our lanterns and sprint back to the car, which sat in the parking lot of a church. We go inside looking for salvation and a bathroom. After the most beautiful urination of my life, my boyfriend and I sit in the pews. Unfortunately neither one of us is religious or knows a single prayer, so we head out to the car, and once again, fear stops us. Our lanterns. Our goddamn ditched lanterns are sitting on top of the car. I want absolutely none of this shit so we get in the car and lock the doors. I pull out of the parking lot and drive slowly down frontage.  To the dismay of my boyfriend, and to my own utter confusion now, I want one last look. I pull the car to the shoulder and sit in silence. What seemed to be a loud ticking was coming from the house, so I stupidly turned the car off to hear it. The sound stopped and I looked at my boyfriend who refused to look at the house. “Go” he said. I turned the key. Nothing. Given, it is a 1991 model and it was close to its expiration, but I never had a problem like this. All I could think was SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCK THIS FUCKING SHIT. I must have turned the key 50 times until it started. Without hesitation, I threw it in gear and bolted. 

   I never once went back. I look at it from time to time, still questioning that night. I have thought of a thousand different things, including kids goofing off upstairs. But did they follow us and put our lanterns back on the car? And how the hell would they prevent my car from starting? I still refuse to believe it was spirits, or anything of that nature. But it was fucking frightening. That house still stands there, serving no purpose to anyone. They have no plans to knock it down anytime soon.


TLDR; Burned down abandoned house/bar is terrifying and I will never step foot inside again. ",nosleep,HeadsOnSticks,/r/nosleep/comments/f0ej2/boars_nest/

69,Cavedweller,1294770104,"Once there was a man who lived in a cave. A dirty smelly cave, and a dirty smelly man. The man was ugly and he was hated by everyone in the near village, and was cast off into the cave. And since the man began to live in the cave, each night he would come out of his cave and walk to the stream that ran in the woods, so he can look into his dark shadow and compliment it, for he would be unable to see his own ugly face, and would not loathe himself for it. This man hated children, and beautiful women. He hated men too, because the men from the village always kicked him and spat at him. But he hated the children and the women especially, out of sheer jealousy of a carefree spirit, and of beautiful skin. And so each time he would look upon a woman or a child who were not in the presence of men, he would harass them and intimidate them, and threaten to eat them. 

This cavedweller's reputation was well known, and for a generation he became the terror in the night. Fables were told of the cavedweller who ate naughty children. These fables, however, spurned the youth of the village to prove their bravery to one another. As a test of courage, they devised The Cave Game. The rules were simple: a child would be sent into the woods outside of the village to find the cave in which the man from the fables lived, on a moonless night. When in the cave, the child would have to find its inhabitant and pull out a single hair from the man's head. In all of the stories, the man had dark red hair.

One day, a boy was challenged to play the game, and wishing not to be humilated by refusing, took up the challenge. Come the night, the boy walked with his friends on the path through town toward the woods. At the last house his friends egged him forth into the woods, while they would stay behind and wait for him until morning. The boy began walking down the path, quickly at first, to appear courageous to his friends, and then when they were out of view, more cautiously, with thought behind each step. In the night, the hissing of the wind and the rustling of the trees sounded sinister, as though the satyrs and the sprites were whispering their plans against the villagers; as though the devil himself was nearby and whistling on his hellish pipe temptations with which to trick a faithful soul. The cave was said to be near the creek which ran through the woods, and upon hitting the part of the path that turned into a small wooden bridge the boy knew to stop. He continued up the creek in search of a rocky wall in which the infamous cave should be. He heard a shuffle in the leaves, to see a shape move through the trees, and he did not know whether he saw a shade from hell or a simple creature of the woods. He heard a breathing sound, as though there was a man nearby suffering from a cold. A snore, perhaps. The boy stopped, and made himself small against the ground. He listened and he looked for shapes that were not trees nearby, and saw as the wood turned uphill, a distortion in the wood's geometry. Among the straight cylinders of trees, stood a boxlike formation. 

The boy hesitated and then he pressed on. Gripping to trees and brenches for strength he slowly and quitely, hunched, made his way to the formation of rock. He had found the cave, a crack in the rock just wide enough for the boy to fit. He squeezed himself through, into a large pocket in the rock. This was the cave. He could make out a small candle on the ground, and a blanket. It smelled like rot and garbage. But the man was not there, the crevace was empty. The boy, not knowing what else to do, hid himself under the blanket that he found, and waited for the man to come back. He waited, and waited, and soon he slipped out of consciousness and into the world of dreams. 
	
He felt a pinch. The cave was still dark when the boy awoke with a start, confused as to where he was. It took his mind a moment to come back to the world around his body. He stood up, and looked over his surroundings, and then he noticed the smell. It was even worse than before, the rot and the garbage gained a dark and heavy quality, as though it was now more consentrated. The boy was knocked back by its power and had to cover his face. He decided to leave the crevice and squeezed through the crack of the cave. There was a sound of running water coming from the stream, saw the mild silvery glow of flowing water as he made towards it. Then, a hunched figure came from behind a tree and the boy stopped in his tracks. His mind told him to run but his legs stood still. And then, for a second, he remembered that in order to win the game, he would need the man's hair, and he began to close the distance between himself and the figure as his limbs shook as if his body was being shaken like a flag in the wind. He extended his hand as the figure extended its hands, and he heard a creaking and nasally voice say an indistinct word. His hand brushed against rough  and dirty skin as he felt a sharp claw go under his cheek.",nosleep,FinSamar,/r/nosleep/comments/f0cog/cavedweller/

I don’t have many supernatural experiences of my own, and I consider myself to be a skeptic for the most part, but I have been told many compelling stories of my friend’s experiences with the unexplainable. One such story that made an impression on me was told to me by my friend Jeff and his best friend’s mother Hannah, (names changed for this story).

Now to begin with, my friend Jeff is a pretty macho guy. He’s covered in tattoos, drinks a six pack every night, gruff demeanor (despite being a teddy bear once you get to know him). All around, not someone I would fuck with if I didn’t know him. Along with these traits, he’s a pretty big skeptic, and generally doesn’t believe in superstition, or the supernatural for that matter.

The story he told me about his experience with the supernatural therefore struck me as genuine, his cadence didn’t falter. He seemed convinced that it happened just as he recounted “you had to be there in that moment,” he said. 

Jeff spent a lot of time at friends houses when he was young, as he often ran away from his strict disciplinarian parents. The story he told me takes place at the home of his friend Tim, where he had been living for a few weeks. Both Tim and his mother Hannah have corroborated the story and are also at a loss for what really happened in that house, about ten years ago.

ANYWAY, one bad night Jeff ended up at Tim’s house, shot the shit, complained about his parents for a bit before retiring to bed. In the middle of the night, Jeff woke up with thoughts racing through his head. Really horrible stuff, blood and gore, demonic red eyes, ritualistic tools, fires, and demonic figures. Jeff wanted to wake Tim but he was paralyzed in the bed, staring up at the ceiling with more and more horrible thoughts racing. Jeff told me that he was certain that if he woke Tim up, Tim’s eyes would be the very demonic eyes that he saw in his visions, and that both of them would be killed. Jeff likely by fear and Tim by whatever force had possessed him. 

That was just the beginning of the weird shit that began to happen there every night. Jeff mentioned that things would move around the house, like the slats in the living room blinds would occasionally move as if someone had walked into them across their length, or plates would sometimes crash around inside their cabinets. On multiple occasions, they could hear what sounded like tribal drums playing in the distance, with no apparent source. Jeff had racing thoughts a few more times while staying there. Visions of things like horses, Native Americans with laid down Mohawks, and on one occasion, loud knocking followed by the sounds of dogs growling and fighting.

Jeff finally said “I know it sounds made up, but seriously, you just had to be there to experience it.”

Hannah then told me an interconnected story of her brother who speaks to God. I didn’t catch his name, let’s call him Bob. Bob called Hannah one day reminiscing about their childhood. The topic of God came up, Bob now a devout Christian, and Bob told Hannah that “I talk to God.” Bob then proceeded to tell her a very spooky story from their childhood.

Bob continued, “Remember when you were little and you had your friend over and (their other brother Mike) had a friend over.. We were upstairs and we decided to have a séance, and we called the Devil…” Hannah explained to me that the séance.. Was successful. Mike ended up contorting violently and nearly seizing while they performed the ritual, which caused them to immediately stop. She didn’t say much more about this but it was implied that Mike was being possessed, attacked, or having some horrible reaction to whatever being entered the room. 

“When you did that, you opened a door and you let something attach to you. God wants me to help get rid of those things that are attached to you. Can I pray for you?” (These are word for word from Hannah, I recorded a portion of our conversation.) Hannah agreed and as Bob began to pray, Hannah started to hear these horrible, muffled screams coming from somewhere in the house. The screams continued and worsened until Bob’s prayer was finished.

Hannah, of course, felt better afterwards and even described herself as feeling lighter. Later on in the day, a young Tim got home from school and his first question was “What’s going on?” He immediately felt a change in the atmosphere of the house and said “It just feels empty..”

72,Soulrot.,1294765439,"I like waxing eloquent when I am slightly famished, so bear with me as I recall those incidents back in the day.

Trudging forward had never seemed so important before in my life. Snow clung on to my boots like a desperate, dead lover, and the frosty mist veiled my eyes from most of the blizzard-ridden lands in front of me. I trudged still, carrying the sack full of the remains of the Project. A sheaf of papers, three pen drives, a five terabyte hard disk, two one terabyte hard disks and the bloody, dead remains of one of the experiments.


A little way off, the outline of Outpost One-Eight-Charlie presented itself to me. In the mild storm, the outline hissed and frayed, coming alive and flickering off existence. It seemed ghastly; like a tall tower of an evil entity. So tall that if you stood at its crown, the world’s curvature could be discerned. However, most of the work of Outpost One-Eight-Charlie was done below the ground. The tall spire was just for the communications network.

The guard let me in with the customary, semi-friendly questions. He looked at my ID and did not ask any questions. Nobody ever did with the Project. It’d take them a minimum of six days and a maximum of three weeks before they find out that the research laboratory was destroyed, along with all the staff, research logs and the subjects.

Subjects being human, of course.

I made myself comfortable inside the room. The heater was on high and very soon I felt the comfort of 20 degrees Celsius. I removed my coats and made myself comfy. It was good to be back in the urban warmth of a Tysdask Corporation suite. The room was no different from my room at the research lab, except that this was perhaps slightly larger. The outer, apparent, layer of the room was homely. There was a large bed with white sheets. Some wooden furniture. A television set. The Ethernet cable (the company didn’t use wireless so much because of the minor security concerns) and a very cheerful looking night lamp and clock. It had some peripheral decorations as well. A painting of a boy reaching out to the sky – waiting for it to rain and some landscape photographs. The subtle, stylized DNA logo of the corporation on mostly everything formed the next layer. The third layer was the security detail and a few nondescript bugs. The fifth was the explosive layer of RDX that waited patiently for a self-destruct command from the tiny switch inside the command office.

Everything was done in an ordered fashion in Tysdask.

That was the first thing I grew to like when I was posted there. That, and the cleanliness. Parasite agents were usually sent to many dingy inescapable hells. Many of them were also research labs. Tysdask labs were very clean; not hospital-clean in the living areas, mind you. Somewhat like a four-star hotel clean. For the most part, utmost care was taken that the staff get adjusted to living a comfortable life after experiment hours.

Most of the experiments did not involve direct participation of the scientific staff, anyway. There were the technical and physical handlers and most of the time the security guards took part too. It was a combined effort. In my second week of work there, we even celebrated at the successful experimentation on a RPV-221 whose brain was connected with the composite eye of a fruit fly, and he was conscious enough to tell us what he experienced. RPV-221, a Mr. T. Pher was conscious for about four minutes and fifteen seconds before brain death occurred, possibly from alien information overload. MRIs were taken at every moment and his spoken thoughts were recorded.

All the experimental data, fundamental principles, comments and everything else was safely stored in the hard disks I carried.

There were other conscious state experiments conducted as well, everything correctly anaesthetised such that the subject woke up right at the beginning of the conscious phase. Dr. S. Campanine had a beautiful way with the syringe and scopolamine. How she worked with the subjects was nothing short of art.

This one day I saw her with another severance and reattachment experiment. When I saw her work through all that blood splattering from the vertebral and carotid arteries, well…I got attracted to her kind of work. She was quite swift, ensuring the subject’s ultimate survival even when theory dictated a good chance of failure. Her hands moved like they were rigidly focused on completing the task at hand. The way her latex-clothed fingers gripped the syringes were abnormally similar to how one holds a pen while writing a masterpiece.

Or my brain was lying to me.

This place had that quality.

There was so much to be done in that spotless white hall of mirrors that no one ever cared to look up from their experiments. All of them had work. Work and subjects. There was nothing more inspiring than seeing that dedicated bunch of scientists doing science for science’s sake. Ugly science. Hurtful science. Still science.

It was a good six month stay at the Tysdask Lab when I got my call. Somehow I felt like the folks over could read my micro expressions. I was destined for this job. This psychological punishment for doing what I did at my last job. They never expected me to normalize to it.

They didn’t even expect me to grow to like it.

I entered the laboratory as an aspiring researcher on neurotectonics. My persona’s only reason to exist was to explain personality shifts with chronic and acute levels of trauma. While the work I did was only on the victims, I knew that many of my colleagues were also wondering how their psychology would change at the end of the project. The Project made it ever so easy to grope with this question; over half of the staff were senior psychologists or psychoanalysts. They all knew that this was one of those trauma-inducing projects that would scar them for life. They all knew that the money they received at the end of it would not bring them peace. Some feared that they would be killed at the end of this, like in one of those movies. The wiser ones wished for death.

It took me a whole week to collect all the data, though. Nevertheless my position and work experience demanded most of the data, anyway. All sitting comfortably in the warmth of the electric heater in front of me now. Dumb and lifeless, like SFP-10′s brain in a jar; still bloody though.

The agency knew that the project needs to be “dismantled”, but the results would be circulated around the rogue scientific journals. Eventually. This was how it happened. This was how it always happened.

The scientists at the research lab could feel this, I would have later believed. To save me that mental horror, I was to be sent to amnesia ward soon after my debriefing. Another hall of mirrors.

I wondered, before leaving Outpost One-Eight-Charlie, if the scientists ever thought about a psychological escape plan like mine.

Yet they toiled. Somehow, they knew this would benefit humankind at some point of time. Although how, they would never be able to say. Everything dies in the end. Even the brain’s infinite capacity to hold on to life. Even the soul.

Everything dies.

And I trudged ever forward.",nosleep,pBeloBAC11,/r/nosleep/comments/f0b1e/soulrot/

75,A word on storytelling,1294760213,"I know ""Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark"" pop up on here from time to time. In the introduction to the first one Alvin Schwartz included this (edited a bit). I always remembered it when telling stories:

---
Many years ago a young prince became famous for a scary story he started to tell, but did not finish. His name was Mamillius, and he probabily was nine or ten years old. William SHakespeare told about him in The Winter's Tale.

It was a dark winter's day that his mother, the queen, asked him for a story.

""A sad tale's best for winter,"" he said. ""I have one of sprites and goblins.""

""Do your best to frighten me with your sprites,"" she said. ""You're powerful at it.""

""I shal tell it softly,"" he said. ""Yond crickets shall not hear it.""

And he began, ""There was a man dwelth by a churchyard."" But that was as far as he got. For at that moment the king came in and arrested the queen and tood her away. And soon after that, Mamillius died. No ones knows how he would have finished his story. 

Most scary stories are, of course, meant to be told. They are more scary that way. But *how* you tel them is important.

As Mamillius knew, the best way is to speak softly, so that your listeners lean forward to catch your words, and to speak slowly, so that your voice sounds scary.

And the best time to tell these stories is at night. In the dark and the gloom, it is easy for someone listening to imagine all sorts of strage and scary thing.",nosleep,Crow_T_Robot,/r/nosleep/comments/f099j/a_word_on_storytelling/
76,"First and foremost: Fuck everything about what I am planning to do.
",1294755343,"First and foremost: Fuck everything about what I am planning to do.

Earlier tonight I found [Reikk's experiences](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ezdrb/lets_play_the_midnight_game_gentlemen/c1c5a7y) with the Midnight Game. It intrigued me.

I too have the house to myself, and until thursday evening I need something to do; this is perfect. Even the moon won't be out. I read through the comments and noticed that people really wished it had been filmed, but Reikk could not because of the light rule. This is where I feel I was almost meant to stay up tonight and find this post. I just so happen to have a camera with more than enough memory to film for three hours and 33 minutes but also many many IR LEDs which I can use in conjunction with my camera to make a suitable recording device. 

With a little bit of luck I can rig up a harness tomorrow and go through with this idiotic idea tonight or wednesday night. 

You are probably asking yourself by now: Why Mr_Chris? Why are you doing this after what Reikk went through? This is unnecessary (even though a video would be amazing to watch).

To put it somewhat short: I love/hate doing stupid things like this. Ever since middle school when a friend of mine and I discovered my house was haunted, I've done stupid things like this. Over the course of investigating my house I developed a reckless urge to push the envelope. One notable occasion had me meditating in a corner in an effort to ""provoke"" a response while my friend filmed. The result of which was nearly suffocating from a gas leak that mysteriously disappeared after we left the garage. 

When I got to college, it only became worse. I had to up the ante. It just so happened that my little school, which sat in the middle of the woods, had a small abandoned medical building between it and town. In my infinite stupidity I walked there in the middle of the night (without telling a soul) with solely a flashlight, camera and knife (for comfort more than protection).  But I digress. 

I'll post updates on my progress setting up (and stories if anyone wants to hear them) and, hopefully I won't have a run in with the midnight man (either wednesday morning or thursday morning) followed by the recording sometime Thursday. 

Fuck why do I do this to myself?


Update: Several people have expressed interest in hearing some of my stories so I'm going to make another post with some good ones all today while I prep. If I finish tonight I'll start the game at midnight PST otherwise It'll be tomorrow night

Update #2: ~~I've been busy in the workshop cooking up these [babies](http://i.imgur.com/bF2oU.jpg) Nine IR LEDS ready to mount with a power source. All I need now is to rig up a mount and reflectors so you guys see more than 2 ft in front of me. As for video I will be using a small point and shoot, I've tested it and it is sensitive to the IR from the LEDs. the only downside is that it can only do 1hr at a time so the footage will be in 4 files all together.  (I would go with the live stream but my only webcam is built into my laptop so I can't go with the backpack)~~ 

~~As for the concern that IRs are breaking the rules: I don't think they do. The point of the no light rule, in my mind, was to keep your field of vision to that of the candle and to keep people from turning on house lights. The LEDS I'm using will be completely invisible to me and the screen of my camera will me covered, I will still be unable to see beyond the light of the candle. It will only be you guys that will benefit from the LEDs~~

I just did a test with the camera and the candle, I'm surprised at how much it could pick up even in the living room (the largest room in the house) I may drop the LEDs (there goes more time and burns than I'm willing to admit haha)


Update #3: Tonight's the night. Everyone as worked up as I am? Heres the plan: I'm scrapping the IR LEDs (my burnt fingers cry out in anguish) and going with just the candle and camera. I checked the weather tonight and the moon will have set by midnight so it'll be pretty dark. I may also close all the blinds in the house to really remove all light as well as leave all the doors open (except those to the outside). The camera is going to be mounted to my chest, I managed to make a little harness  and I'll be using a pocket watch set to USNO master clock for time keeping.


I know I promised posting some stories last night and I apologize. I went to a cookout at a friend's place totally expecting to be back before midnight. I did make it back on time but brought others and we started drinking. I was a little ""preoccupied"" with a girl after that. To make up for it, I'll tell some of the stories while avoiding the Midnight Man tonight.

Update #4: 11:15pm PST  It's 45 minutes until midnight, I'm going to go make sure I have everything and that my camera is charged. Man I shouldn't have read nosleep before doing this. Fuuuuuck. I'll be back by 3:34am. I hope.

77,The Abandoned High School,1294745217,"Thinking about this still gives me the chills.  Every year my friend's grandparents would throw a BBQ dinner in honor of their anniversary in a little town in the middle of nowhere called, Kenney, Illinois.  The first and only time I went was two years ago for their 50th, which turned out to be great.  It was the events after the party that shook me up.  Kenney is the epitamy of boofoo.  A small town with a Main street that last no longer than a city block, littered with the remnants of failed business and empty lots.  In fact, the only place that seemed to survive was the local tap.  Towards the end of the street, past the columns of buzzing street lights was a building, barely recognizable in the distance.  The tallest building in the area, yet only three floors it seemed to loom over everything else.  Before I could ask, my tour guide was already giving me the backstory.  ""That's the old high school,"" he stated with delight.  ""It was abandoned after the war.""  It made sense, seeing as how everything else in he town seemed to be stuck in the fifties.  Without hesitation, my friend and his brother were dragging me to end of the street.  I was worried that we'd be caught for trespassing, but they assured me that the only sheriff in town was actually at the party along with the other fifty residents.  From up close the building was a dilapidated shack.  Windows that hadn't been boarded were long smashed.  The front entrance was blocked by a rusted heap of bicycle racks, with a few rotted bikes still attached.  Our only way in was around back, thru the gymnasium.  I barely took one step in before I realized, from my view, there was no floor.  An empty pit of a gymnasium, the wood court collapsed under the weight of what looked to be hundreds of desks and chairs.  I watched as the pros demonstrated their technique to get thru, without getting tetanus.  Thru the door, each one took turns grabbing hold of a handrail from what once was a stairway, carefully shimmying across to a make shift stage.  I am neither the most active or agile person, but somehow, my clumsy ass slowly but surely made it across.  The view was like nothing I'd ever seen before.  A room that once held proms, graduations and basketball tournaments was now a graveyard.  Fifty years of dust caked the windows that barely let what little sunlight was left in and being the geniuses we were, no flashlight was ever considered.  We debated wether or not to go on but I decided that there was no way I was going to come all the way the hell out there not to, so we ventured on, making sure we stuck together.  We made our way thru a windowless stairwell each step a crunch of cracked lead paint that layered the floor.  Soon I was peering down a long hallway of classroom doors and metal lockers.  Some doors still locked, others left open and emptied.  I cautiously looked into one classroom, barely able to see in my eyes soon adjusted to the light.  In the far corner near a single desk, a pile of books lay on the ground.  I both intrigued and terrified.  I carefully took a few steps in the room before I realized they were yearbooks.  On the desk a single yearbook lay open with multiple pages torn out.  The faces in the books were worn from years of neglect.  It didn't take long before I realized I was the only one in the room, as I heard my friend calling me from outside the class. I quickly shuffled back into the hall hoping to see my friends.  The hall was empty.  I stood alone down the corridor confused.  I called their names.  No response.  I was getting nervous, walking quickly with my guard up towards the end of the hall to what looked to be the office.  I looked into the office only for a moment to call their names before a cold chill went up my spine and I decided it was time to go.  I called their names one last time, informing them that i was pussy and on my way out.  I turned back down the long hallway, retracing my steps.  I was too nervous and stopped momentarily to search for my lighter.  I slowed down fumbled with my pockets to find my pack of cigarettes and joyfully lit up.  That was all I needed.  I just needed to calm down.  As I triumphantly inhaled a calming plum of smoke I looked up quickly to find that I was in front of the class I had walked into.  Before I could exhale or realize where I was, a crackled voice I will never forget came from inside the classroom.  ""Come back inside.""  Before I could choke on fear and smoke, my legs picked me up and drove me out that hall.  My body trembled and my legs felt like jelly.  Faster than I ever knew I could run I was thru the stairwell and back onto the gymnasium stage.  There near the exit were my friends with blank expressions on their faces, wondering what the hell I was running from.  I pushed past them and climbed the handrail and out the door in record time.  Out the door and into the field I ran to safety, anywhere was safety at that point.  Anywhere but there.  I collapsed out of breath at the end of the block.  I couldn't have been happier to be out of the high school faster.  Looking back, the only thing I regret was not having a camera, in some ways it was beautiful.  In fact if I wasn't such a chickenshit I'd say I'd love to go back in there one day to get a few shots.  Unfortunately, there is no way in hell I would ever go back in there again.

80,A very interesting dream I had in high school.,1294735450,"My dream starts out at night. I'm in my home town and I had snuck out of the house to go hang out with friends. I never snuck out of my own house so that was kind of fun to do in my dream. So I'm hanging out with my friends and we are all sitting at a picnic table. There was a fight and we all went home afterwards. The next day (in my dream) I wake up to find myself in prison. I had no memory of how I got there.

The really fucked up shit starts here. I'm in prison, but the prison is my high school. All of the windows are barred and everyone is wearing orange jumpsuits and shackles. AND all the other inmates are my classmates. AND they don't know how they got there either. It was like everyone went to bed that night and woke up in a different dimension. Plus there are all these guards walking around with M16 rifles and what not. Wearing swat suits, fuckers.

So I'm in A Hall which is all the science classrooms. The prisoners are all walking in a line shackled together, myself included. All of a sudden Queen Latifah walks up as one of the guards. She's all like, ""Shut the fuck up and get back in line."" So we act like nothing is happening and keep facing forward.

THEN some kid is able to sneak into one of the labs and he starts a fire. I snuck into the classroom after him and hide under a big table. Once the flames get going and the guards take notice we make a run for it. But then it all becomes so clear how we got there. 

As I run out the front doors I head across this big field that is in front of out school, and I take FLIGHT. It was fucking crazy in this dream. I felt wind around me, vertigo as my balance was thrown off. The really fucking cool part was that I had complete control over what I was doing in my dream. I was like, I want to go higher, so I did. Then I notice that there are other kids in the air with me. That's when I remembered what happened.

It was the most epic epiphany I ever had. I suddenly remembered that the entire student body had become witches. And our parents and teachers had used the high school as our prison because that was the only place we could all fit. With this stunning realization I felt the revenge boil up inside of me and I began to burn things with my mind. Just before I woke up my entire school was ablaze, no doubt with Queen Latifah inside. 

So yeah, this dream did actually happen. It was really bizarre and I wrote everything down so I would never forget it. I hope you guys enjoyed the read, sorry if I'm not a good writer.",nosleep,thatdbeprettyawesum,/r/nosleep/comments/f043u/a_very_interesting_dream_i_had_in_high_school/

84,Small Town Oklahoma,1294713103,"About five years ago, I was visiting a college friend, Anna, for the weekend. I went with her and three of her other friends to visit [Kitchen Lake Bridge](http://www.strangeusa.com/ViewLocation.aspx?locationid=7934) a little after midnight on an unseasonably cold October night. We heard some strange noises at the bridge, and even experienced a strong smell of roses instantly turn into a powerful smell of rotting flesh.

That was unnerving enough, but that wasn't where the chills ended.

We climbed back into the car for the long journey down a gravel road out of the woods. We had only been driving for a few minutes when we noticed one of Anna's friends, Jill, in the backseat was crying quietly to herself.

Anna seemed alarmed and asked Jill what was wrong, and if she was okay.

Jill forced a laugh and wiped some tears away. She replied that she was okay, it was just that the trip to the bridge had brought back some bad memories for her.

This is the story she told us.

When Jill was 10 and her sister was 4, one of her parents' friends died of cancer. The woman, Mary Beth, was married to Jill's father's best friend, and she had been a bridesmaid in Jill's parents' wedding. Mary Beth had gotten sick rather suddenly in the fall, and died in early December. Her husband, Jill's father's friend, was grief stricken.

On Christmas Eve, Jill was riding home from her grandparents' house with her mother and sister. Her father was driving in his truck, about a quarter mile ahead of them. She couldn't remember why they were in two separate vehicles, but said it was probably because her dad had met them directly at the grandparents' house when he got off of work.

It was late and dark as they passed the cemetery where Mary Beth was buried. Jill got her mother and sister's attention and pointed out a strange light moving through the cemetery, heading towards the road. They watched as the light exited the cemetery and followed her dad's truck for several miles, before finally disappearing a few blocks from their home.

As soon as the car pulled up to the house, Jill, her sister and mother jumped out to excitedly ask her father if he too had seen the strange light following his truck. He flatly said no, he had not seen any lights, and he didn't want to hear about it again.

Starting that night, and for the next six months or so, Jill's father showed increasingly erratic and aggressive behavior. He began drinking heavily, scowling at Jill and her sister over the dinner table, screaming at their mother, walking off of several jobs, gambling, disappearing for days at a time and even attempting to physically assault his wife.

After the attempted assault, Jill's mother demanded an explanation for his sudden, dramatic change, and threatened him with divorce with no possibility of seeing his children. Jill's father broke down crying.

He explained that on Christmas Eve, as he drove past the cemetery where Jill had seen the strange light follow his truck, he had never seen the light. Instead, when he turned and looked at the passenger's seat, he saw his dead friend - Mary Beth.

He said her skin was gray and green. Her hair was matted and her teeth were rotten. Her lips were purple and they curled into a sneer. But her eyes were hollow and empty - as black as night.

He blinked several times, and she was gone.

But since then, he had seen her several more times. Sometimes he would glance out the window and see her standing in the front yard, looking in. Sometimes she was watching him from across a crowded store. A few times, she was standing at the foot of the bed.

He hadn't mentioned it to anyone for six months. He didn't know if he was dying or going insane.

The rest of Jill's story fizzled out about there. It seems, after unburdening himself of this secret, her father never saw Mary Beth again, and all of his strange, dark behavior went away. Her family hasn't spoken about it since, but something about being at Kitchen Lake Bridge brought all of those memories back to the surface.

89,Grandma's House,1294698079,"When I was six years old my parents took a holiday weekend together at a hotel about an hour away and left me in the care of my grandmother, who was 72 at the time. I absolutely hated going to my grandmother's house—there's a certain smell that a person gives off when their bodies begin to slowly die. My grandmother would also mumble to herself often, having intelligible conversations with absolutely no one, and sometimes the talking became sharp and aggressive. I kept mostly to myself in the spare room, surrounded by old portraits of family members I'd never met, and the porcelain figurines that she collected. I ate my meals quickly and kept my door shut. It was either that or spend time in the backyard; though, I didn't much like being in the backyard because she'd watch me from the kitchen window, her face looming up there in a cold darkness, those wrinkled and worn hands parting the thin lace curtains.  

I was to stay there for three days, two nights.  On the second night, I shoveled my dinner—dry chicken and soupy mashed potatoes—down my throat and made a move to get up from the table. But before I could do that she grabbed my wrist. Her hands were cold and I could feel every fold of skin on her palms as she gripped tighter. I looked down to see her thick veins sticking out like lengths of round electrical cord. I screamed.

“*Where are your manners*?” she growled at me. I looked into her eyes. They were brown and almost bloodshot. Her face was gnarled with rage and with age I'd never noticed before, as if she'd grown fifty years older in that moment. “*Little boys shouldn't excuse themselves from the table without asking*.” She hissed out the last syllables, letting a black tongue slide around behind her teeth, and I began to cry. I tried to shake my arm free, but her grip tightened still. Veins throbbed on her forehead, muscles tensed around her jawbone. She brought her face within inches of mine and let out a hollow laugh, and as she did her hot breath poured over my face. It smelled at first faintly of blood, and then as she continued to laugh, the smell of rotten meat ran into my nostrils, eyes, and mouth.

“Let go,” I screamed. She smiled and held tighter. Her grip was so tight that my arm began to tingle, and I panicked. I threw my half-finished glass of water onto her face. She recoiled in shock, let go of my hand, and gasped. I ran into my room as fast as I could, slamming the door shut behind me. 

“*Miiiichaeelllll*,” she croaked out from the kitchen. I pretended that I didn't hear her, but pushed a nightstand against the door all the same. “*Miiiichaeelll*l,” she seemed to sing now. She was coming down the hall, I heard her dragged footsteps getting closer. Then a loud BANG, as if something had fallen, and she called my name three more times. Her voice had changed, though—it was as if she were speaking through a mouthful of gravel, taking quick wheezing breaths between. She sounded like she were being choked. 

I peeked out of the doorway. I saw my grandmother laying on her back five feet down the hallway, the pale blue of the carpet tangled in her stark white hair. With one hand she gripped her chest, with the other she reached out. The way she had been laying, her head was closest to the door so she strained her neck backwards to look at me. She saw me through upside down eyes, and attempted to slide herself across the floor by pushing against the carpet with her feet. I slammed the door. 

I hummed loudly to block out her moaning. It was working—her voice was either completely drowned out by my humming, or she had stopped. Either way I was grateful, but still hummed.

Then a sound came through my humming. The sound of scratching at my bottom of my door, as if she were trying to reach her fingers underneath. I picture here there on the carpet, her wrinkled, distorted face, those reaching fingers, those terrible eyes. 

And then the scratching stopped. I waited for what seemed like hours before pulling the nightstand away from the door and peeking out again. There she was, on her back, face still stretched in agony like some wax figure in a horror movie. Her hands had fallen to the ground, those fingers still stretched out rigidly like petrified wood. Was she dead? I thought so. But her face, and those fingers...they seemed to be still groaning, still reaching. And those eyes, those big brown eyes, they had been staring right up at me as soon as I'd opened the door. There seemed to be movement behind those eyes. I slammed the door and hid behind the bed.. 

Darkness fell, I turned on the light. Then, I remembered that my mother had slipped a piece of paper into the front pocket of my pants before leaving. I pulled out both pockets, and a folded slip of paper fell onto the floor. The hotel room's phone number was written on it, along with other emergency contact numbers. As quickly and quietly as possible I grabbed the phone from the nightstand and ran back behind the bed. 

I had nightmares for 3 weeks about that face. Those fingers. To this day I cannot sleep with the door open, and I cannot look an old woman in the eyes for more than a few moments.",nosleep,campfire_stories,/r/nosleep/comments/ezt6b/grandmas_house/

93,Haven't slept in the room since.,1294652588,"About six months ago I was in my room watching a movie around four in the morning, as the movie finished I got my headphones on and chose a song while I got up to change the disc. After I put the disc in I turned around to jump back on my bed when I thought I saw a face on a pillow that was against the wall, I wasn't sure if it was just my eyes that were blurry or something so I rubbed them and looked closer (kind of like people do in movies) and sure enough there it was, a floating head above my bed moving slowly from left to right. There was a gloomy oval around it which to me looked like a portal and an extremely white light in the up right corner of the room, the whole sighting was around five seconds and as the head moved it was moving her mouth like she was talking to someone, but it wasn't me because she never looked at me directly in the eyes. After this both the light and the head vanished and I was standing there in the dark wondering if what had just happened did in fact happen. I didn't sleep the rest of night and told my mom in the morning, it sure gave her goose bumps when I told her that the head was my aunt who passed away from cancer three years ago.

94,Night terrors as a child.,1294650386,"Hey guys, thought I'd share some night terror I had when I was a lad.

When I was younger I had a recurring series of night terrors which I still vividly recall to this day. They'd occur only occasionally but every time they did happen I'd always be sleeping on the living room couch, they never happened when I'd sleep elsewhere.

I'd wake up with a deep sense of foreboding and unable to move. I'd feel that there was something at the foot of the stairs by the driveway door. (Living room is kitchen adjacent, the driveway door/stairs leading to the basement were on the opposite side of the kitchen from the living room) I'd try to get up or yell for my parents but find myself unable to so much as squeak. I'd feel whatever it was draw closer with each step and every time it would stop, pause, and then shove it's hands or whatever inside of me through the chest and I'd feel this unbelievably cold and terrible feeling and I'd ""wake up"".

Sometimes I'd have my eyes open when it'd happen, sometimes shut but no matter what I tried to do the outcome would always be the same. After a number of years though, the terrors stopped and things were fine.

Mom's house has always creeped me out but it wasn't until the other year that mom told me about the prior owners of the house which cast my night terrors in a new light. The son of the prior owners had lived in the basement and prior to committing suicide took a sledgehammer and trashed/wrecked the basement before jumping off a building in Grand Rapids.

I doubt this has anything to do with the terrors themselves but it certainly does make for some good food for thought. The basement has always been the creepiest part of the house. Cold, unfinished, bare concrete walls. An ex-girlfriend of mine at one point said she believed there was something in the house and one time went though the basement snapping picture after picture. In the corner of the basement (directly underneath what was my bedroom) in a few of the pictures there appears to be the slender figure of a man. Hard to say what it was exactly, I think it could have been a trick of the light, but it was definitely creepy at the time.

I don't think there was anything especially supernatural with my mother's house, creepy though it may be, but I try to keep an open mind with things like this. It's been fun though writing out my past experiences and I hope you guys found it somewhat interesting or a fun read.

If any of you would like to know more or have any questions, please ask and I'd be happy to answer as best I can.

99,Need help finding an old creepypasta,1294627031,"So I've been thinking about this one thing I read on the internet a very long time ago, over 5 or 6 years. It was one of the most horrifying and scary stories I've ever read. I think I may have saw it on the ebaumsworld forums (hilarious, right?).

It was a (very long) first person account about a guy recalling his childhood. He would hang out with his best friend in his basement every day and live his childhood. His father was gone and he only had his mother, who was poor and maybe alcoholic.

The story goes on for a while until the kid has to move out of his house. On the way out of town, the mother brings him to the graveyard. In the graveyard, she takes him to the grave of his brother, who died before he was born and she never told him about. On the grave was the name of his best friend.

It continued after that, but I don't remember much else. Has anyone else read this story? I'd like to read it again, but all of my time reading ""creepypasta"" (since that term came about), I've never seen it.",nosleep,LeonGrey,/r/nosleep/comments/ez9rm/need_help_finding_an_old_creepypasta/
0,Hey everyone! I haven't been around here for a while and I have a new idea...,1294622787,"I was just thinking of this fine community an hour or two ago while writing and I thought to myself that a big short story kind of competition (but not competition) would be great!

We have a lot of talented writers in here, and I would absolutely love to see what some of you could come up with!

Now I know I'm not a mod, but it would be great if the mods read this and decide to organise a little expose of peoples short stories (wink wink). Everyone would have a set amount of time to write something (like, say, 2 weeks) and then they would post them in this sub-reddit and we would all link to them under a designated post topic. 

Subject is free reign, you can write about whatever you like (as long as it's creepy, horrifying or terror inducing... no ponies!). The only rule I can give is: no slender man! not that I have anything against our finely suited ghoul, but because I want to see what some of you can come up with on your own. I want to see what you can pull up from the terrifying depths of your imagination and who knows, if this does take off, maybe we can make it a fortnightly thing!

I really look forward to hearing what you think about this!


(Absolutely anybody can submit, please don't feel you can't due to bad writing skills. This isn't about who can write better, it's about how much fun writing can be. It's about showing everyone the inner workings of your mind, your deepest fears, the things that terrify you most. If it can be read, then it can be submitted. I really want everyone to go nuts and have a bucket load of fun in the process!)

**EDIT:** This will mainly be a Fiction contest. Though if you have a real world experience that is equally as horrifying, go for it! Like I said, no strict rules (remember: Everything is true, even if it's not!)

**EDIT 2:** I'm gonna go with a word limit of between 200 and 1200 characters. It shouldn't really be longer, as stories tend to ramble a bit when they are. anything smaller than 200 tends to be a little less fleshed out than it should be.

I would say that 600 or so would be perfect.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/ez8mh/hey_everyone_i_havent_been_around_here_for_a/
1,Fourth meal,1294622026,"A couple of years ago, I was in my last semester of Grad school. I lived with my wife in a duplex we shared with the landlord. It wasn't exactly a great place, but it was secluded from all the ""college activity"" which was nice. It was actually *quite* secluded. There was a forest at the edge of town, and we lived in the middle of it, down a mile long gravel road that twisted around the side of a mountain through dense trees. The duplex was the only home on this road, so it's just as accurate to call it our driveway.

Since I was a grad student, I had the privilege of having later classes, and my wife worked part time for a chiropractor in the afternoon, so we normally stayed up very late, often until 3 or 4 in the morning.
One late night around 1:30 AM, we were both getting kind of hungry. Neither of us felt like cooking at this hour, so I decide to hop in the car and drive into town to get some Taco Bell, since it was the only thing open at the time.

 I walked out into the cold and pressed the remote on my keys to unlock the car. The car door locked. I must have forgotten to lock the car when I got home. Since we were so secluded we never bothered to lock the door to our home, but for some reason I was always adamant about locking the car.  It bothered me, but I hopped in the car after unlocking it again, cranked the engine and started up the driveway. 

It's dark outside. Real dark. This one lane gravel road was cut right through the thick of the forest so there are tall trees on either side of the road that block out all ambient light from the moon or the stars. The farther I traveled along the road, the more *aware* I got that the car had not been locked before I got in. I didn't check the back seat.
Now I was just worrying over nothing. I looked over my shoulder and didn't see anything, just darkness. But I wasn't satisfied. I was looking more at the rear view mirror than I was at the road. No problem though. It doesn't take too much concentration to stay on the road driving 15 mph. The more my eyes adjust to the darkness in the mirror, the more disturbed I became.

I could see what looked like a silhouette of head and shoulders, but it was hard to tell. It could have just been my imagination. It was just so very dark. At this point I believed that my imagination was just manipulating the shape of the back seat headrest. I consoled myself enough to keep driving, but my focus remained glued on what was behind me.
The road curved and there was a break in the trees revealing the moon. The light poured into the car, and lit up the back seat. The light only flashed through for a fraction of a second, but what I saw still causes my eyes to water when I think about it. 

Those eyes. THOSE FUCKING EYES. They were huge and terrifying. I didn't know eyes could open that wide. I could see every detail, the giant pupils, every red vein. They weren't in the corner of the reflection, they were the *entire* contents of my rear view mirror, as if someone in the back had leaned forward enough to put their head in between me and the front passenger seat. My heart sank, and I felt the blood run out of my face. My eyes froze, my gaze fixated. I was afraid to look away from where those eyes had just been.

I didn't stop driving. Why didn't I stop driving? Maybe I thought I would be safer if I jumped out of the car in town. I don't really remember. I don't know what was going through my head at this point. I just know that when I broke through the tree line a few seconds later, the light flooded back into the car, and I was staring at the empty back seat.

5,I've always loved the night.,1294590024,"My eyes shot open as I woke up from a seemingly deep sleep.  Sitting up in bed, sweat pouring down my face, I look over at my bedroom door wide open, like normal, and see some kind of shadowy figure.  ""Fucking sweatshirt,"" I say to myself.  

I moved in to this apartment about 6 months ago, and while I've been happy with it, the lack of places to hang my clothing has been a complete pain.  I wound up buying some hooks that hang over the door frame so I had a place to hang my sweatshirts.  Even though that issue is resolved, I find myself continually scaring...myself, because my bed faces the door.  Naturally, if I wake up during the night, I look towards the door and see the sweatshirts hanging there, resembling a dark figure.  

The apartment itself is your generic one-bedroom layout:  living room that has a kitchen and dining room adjacent to it, then the bedroom that has the only bathroom.  The complex is quaint, quiet.  It's been convenient because since I work swing shift, I normally don't have to deal with anyone, nor do I have to deal with the noise.  That being said, I'm a night owl. 

One night, I get home from working a 13 hour shift; barely making it up the stairs to my 3rd floor apartment because I was running on an hour of sleep.  I go in to my apartment, following my ritual of turning any light on I can, for any room that I enter.  I've always had this problem with my mind creating or recreating scary situations.  It's difficult to explain, but those of you who experience this know what I'm talking about:  you come home, lights are off, mind thinking about the worst case scenario.  Ghosts? Monsters? Burglar?  Then locking the door and rushing to turn on as many lights as possible in order to reassure your psyche.  This is my nightly routine.  

After my nightly ritual, I realize that I have about a half a pair of clean underwear left, with my dirty clothes hamper overflowing with the past week's dirties.  ""Guess I should do some laundry before I lay down,"" I thought.  I grab all of the clothes, then all of the sweatshirts and stuff hanging on the bedroom door, and lastly the sheets and pillow cases, then tossed them in to the washer.  I normally can't fall sleep until I move them in to the dryer; always hated leaving wet stuff sitting in the washer.  However, it wasn't 5 minutes after starting the wash that I passed out.  

My eyes shot open.  I was covered in sweat.  It felt like I had slept for a few hours.  I glanced at my phone to check the time and noticed it had only been 30 minutes;  the washer's end cycle noise had gone off.  I laid there looking at the ceiling, barely making out it's color because of the lack of light in my room.  I lazily sat up, knowing that I needed to move the clothes in to the dryer.  I look through the doorway and see a shadowy figure.  ""Fucking sweatshirt,"" I said aloud.  Then the sweatshirt moved.

10,"Mall of the Damned, true story",1294552325,"From a post in /AskReddit, I was recommended to x-post here. Maybe the only thing in life that truly scared me, while simultaneously filling me with awe.

When I was young, we used to go to King's Island a lot since it's only a few hours away, and it doesn't suck as much as Indiana theme parks. Usually I would sleep on the way there. The whole way, about 6 hours, leaned against the car window and only occasionally drooling on it. This particular instance, my mom and sister spotted an enormous mall on the way home. This part I've only heard from them, because I was asleep. Apparently they decided not to wake me when they first saw the immense 3-story mall that couldn't have possibly been built in the 12 hours since we'd last passed through. The parking lot was full of cars, but they didn't see the usual bustle of shoppers entering or exiting, except for a group of elderly people that followed them in.

When they first walked in they didn't see much. Most of the shops were closed; empty shelves and locked wire shutters were all they could see inside. Most of the ceiling lights were dimmed, or broken altogether. They kept walking, ignoring the choking silence and morbid sights. On the walls, they then saw the graffiti: strange, unrecognizable symbols and worse. Upside-down pentagrams, drawings of devils and goats, and a 14-foot-tall wall filled with what appeared to be latin chants, like an enormous blasphemous hymnal. Then they came to the center of the mall. It was an atrium. Reaching almost to the filthy glass arch in the middle was a ferris wheel filled with silent, blank-faced toddlers. More sat in a nearby sand box. Still more sat on a broken-down train. All of these ""attractions"" were painted in the same graffiti as the walls. And all the toddlers were being watched intently by a horde of senior citizens on benches, sporting the same empty look. That is, until one by one they craned their necks in the newcomers' direction. They smiled. They grinned until their eyes bulged and my mother and sibling could see the backs of their rotten toothless mouths. My family members slowly backed away. They nearly backed into the group behind them.

Both then realized the creepy old people were merely grinning at their freshly-joining companions. Ignoring my family completely, as if they weren't there at all. But when this group sat down, the maniacal grins stopped. The lights dimmed. And my parent and sister ran as quickly as they could out, to the safety of the parking lot and the beaming sunlight. I only half-woke up soon after. We were speeding away from that cursed place. I asked what happened. They said they stopped at the mall. Didn't find anything on sale. But I knew there was something else on their minds. Looking out the back window, before we crested the next hill it disappeared, I might have seen something. Like a mirage.

When we got home I was told the story of what happened. I wanted to see it for myself, even if it cost me my very soul. We'd go through there countless more times in my youth. The next time through, though, the lot was empty. You could tell there'd been a building there at some point, maybe even recently. It was gone. We never saw the mall again, except for one final weekend.

We were going to King's Island one last time. I was headed to college soon, and we weren't going to be able to take these family trips anymore. Soon I'd have classwork, and girlfriends, and with home being half the country away we just wouldn't have the time. So I suggested we go for one last trip to Ohio, for old times' sake. Only I knew the real reason. The mall. I had to see it. One of the downsides to teen driving, as everyone knows, is having to chauffeur the family. This was no different. Of course, I insisted on it this time. We got underway. Nothing eventful. I drove to the amusement park, a hotel, back to the park, but internally I was focused on that one thing. Knowing we were closer somehow made it worse, the ~~desire~~ *need* to find that place of death.

Then, on the way home, it was there. I knew it would be. Waiting for me. Asking me, begging me to open its secrets. I swerved onto the onramp, my sister and mother filled with terror. **""What the fuck are you doing?!""** That was the only time I ever heard my mother swear. Their faces drained of color. My sister bit her lip in terror. I told them ""We're going in. If you won't, I'll be back in an hour."" They had little choice. They couldn't let Only Son or Big Bubbie die from his own stupid, morbid obsession. But it was different from what they had told me. There were people, for one. People going about their business and packing overstuffed plastic bags into minivans packed with screaming kids. Women shoving their purses into helpful hubby's hands to hold. Consumers. We entered. The freshly-painted walls and bright lights conflicted with my childhood version of hell. Plants, smells, colors, people, the sounds of cash registers and people digging into their wallets. We only went into one store. A clothing / souvenir shop just off the central atrium. Didn't buy anything. Grudgingly I agreed to go. I believe the sights were too much for my family members as well; perhaps they were expecting someone to flick a Grimmer switch and plunge them back into the darkened chamber they remembered. I did have to use the restroom, though. On my way out I saw an evil sight: torso, hung on the back of the restroom door! But alas, it was only a shirt. A black shirt with crimson stitching. Long sleeve waffle-weave, no tags. And a shiny silver-colored devil face, complete with horns and goatee, printed on the front. Oh, and one more thing: a note.

&gt;""We regret to inform you that we cannot accept applicants right now. Thank your companions if you wish. You only get one chance in this life, and they've already taken theirs. Yours is still open, however. We hope to see you again soon! - [symbol]""

I left the restroom wearing it over my shirt. Upon seeing the new shirt my family members were immediately sickened and repulsed, so I took it off. I figured I could wear it at college. Which I did. For a while. Some people were just as repulsed as my family. Others felt an attraction to it, almost exactly like the one I'd felt about the mall. Obsession-like in its fierceness. Personally, I thought it was a great way to pick up chicks. Only sometimes would they end up going nuclear on me. I even had a friend comment on how I always tend to attract the crazy ones. ""They're all crazy, man,"" I replied, ""they just don't all tell you right away."" Never really being sure whether it was coincidence, or something darker. They usually did end up wearing that particular shirt. Holding it even when they had their own clothes on. Asking for it. Wanting the shirt. Maybe even more than they wanted me. It was as if *they* wanted to belong to the *shirt* rather than *it* belonging to *them*.

Eventually I let one keep it. ""Lila"", for reasons you might understand. We were starting to look pretty serious. She even got to fly to Indiana to meet my family for the holidays. When we got back, after a pretty long intimate session we were unpacking and she saw it again. Picked it up. Needed it. I was pretty tired by then after the flight and other ""festivities"". I said she could keep it if she just let me rest for the night. I didn't see her the next day. Not an uncommon occurrence. I supposed she needed her rest too. After a few days, though, I was worried. I told her RA. RA told me Lila probably left to visit her own family, but she'd check the room later on. Well, later on happened to be around 8PM. I heard sirens. Again not uncommon, as campus was right next to the fire house. But then I got a call. It was Lila's RA. She'd been in her room the whole time. Her bags hadn't even been unpacked. Nobody is really sure what she did that whole week, but I did find out a few weeks later what happened. Lila was last seen that evening, in the dorm wing's kitchens. She was gathering bleach, newspapers, anything she could get her hands on that would burn. These went into a little pile under her bed. She stripped naked, put that shirt on, and laid down in bed. Then dropped a match. I was questioned by the police about her death. I said we hadn't fought the last night I saw her, but I had asked her to go back to her room so I could rest. They ruled it suicide. The stress of schooling, finals, job offers, leaving friends behind. And who knows. Maybe it was. I am glad of one thing, though: thanks to Lila I will never have to worry over that damn shirt, or the damn place it came from, ever again.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/eyu0y/mall_of_the_damned_true_story/
11,Lavender and Cigarettes,1294552248,"Robert, Emily, and Tim were spending their Friday night as they often had on these mild to cool October evenings in their small Mississippi town. They were sitting on the sidewalk against the brick wall of the local gas station, reading each other spooky stories they found browsing the net on their iPhones, the phones they spent most of their weekday evenings working part time jobs to afford. They were all going to the local community college and the trio detested the normal partying that the local redneck crowd preferred. So as usual, they found themselves on that same sidewalk.

Emily had just finished a story up, revealing that the protagonist had been dead all along. The story itself was typical creepypasta faire at best, but Robert and Tim both secretly agreed that the monotone delivery Emily provided, dripping with just a hint of off-putting sensuality and an accent like Pecan Pie, was the best of the group. It left the two boys unconsciously scooting closer to the light hanging from the corner of the store.

A long shadow passed over the trio, and all three looked up to see a slim man standing in front of them. A wide brim Fedora wrapped his eyes in shadow, but the rest of his faced revealed the smirk of a man in his late forties. He wore a black long sleeve button up and pants and he exuded the cool confidence reminiscent of Harrison Ford in his prime.

""Tryin to scare the shit outta each other huh?"", the man said with a smirk and an accent the three could only identify as being North of the Mason Dixon. Emily rolled her eyes and fired back, ""You mean -I'm- scaring the shit out of -them-."" The man smirked and leaned against the wall, staring down at the trio, ""I gotta story for ya. A true one too, and if you would believe it, it happened right there on the road in front of this very store. Course, at the time it was a cow pasture. You kids up for it?"" The trio looked at one another before Robert looked up at the stranger, and said, ""Sure. But you really don't need the theatrics with trying to make us believe it's a true story."" The man laughed, ""OK kid, sure. But it's true whether you like it or not.""

This is the story he told, only pausing occasionally to stare off towards the road.

About 25 years ago, back when this was all pasture and that road there was dirt, David Godfrey died. Problem was, he didn't realize it yet. Last thing he remembered, he was barreling down the road, drunk on cheap hooch and high on the thrill of his latest con, when he lost control of his car. Last thing he remembered was veering off the road and plowing into an embankment. He remembered flying through the windshield, the shards of glass tearing his flesh, and then blackness. But now he was standing in the middle of the dirt road, not even a scratch present on his skin. This didn't sit right with David. He had an eye for details y'see, being a confidence man. This just didn't add up.

""Well of course it doesn't add up you damn fool."", a husky female voice called out. David jerked around in the pasture, spotting a blond with legs that didn't quit in a red sequined dress with a slit in it that would make the pope sport wood. Her eyes were hidden by a stylish red funeral veil, but her candy red lips smiled, and she poked David in the chest and leaned in and spoke, ""It doesn't make sense, because you're dead! Drinking and driving on a country road in the middle of the night, what a boring way to go."" David was intoxicated by the scent of lavender that emanated from her breath. A heavenly aroma that clouded his mind and made his toes curl. He almost didn't register what she said. Almost. ""Dead? Lady what do you take me for?"", he snorted. ""I take you for a conman. I'm not here to mince words. You're dead. You know it. Now, you didn't live a good life. Don't pretend you did. You'd sell your own mother for fifty bucks and a fifth of jack. The only reason your ass isn't burning in hell already is because you have just enough of a soul to deserve a chance to redeem yourself.""

""So what do I have to do? Save a hundred lost souls? Hunt down escaped demons?"", David laughed, his ego failing to register the seriousness of his situation. The woman pursed her lips. ""No, you dip shit. You don't get off that easy. You have to walk."" David raised and eyebrow, ""Walk? Walk where?"" ""Everywhere. Your sins are miles and you knocked em down like dominoes. When you walk off the burden of every person you bankrupt, every couple you split apart, every child you cheated out of lunch money, and the man you killed, oh yes, I know about Eddie, maybe, MAYBE you’ll get to see what’s next. And listen you piece of shit, don't think because you're dead that it will be easy. You'll get out of breath. You'll feel pain. You'll bleed. But you won't fucking die. Not this time. No body's gonna come to your aid either because nothing living can see you. Nothing -living-. Things you only saw in your nightmares can though, and if they catch you, they can make you suffer. Forever. And if I were you, buddy boy, I'd get moving because the local imp population already smells you."", she said with an increasing smirk on her face.

At that a cacophony of whoops and howls issued forth from the dark, and tiny points of lights appeared off in the distance. David went pale. They were eyes. If he were capable he would have shit his pants. He took one last look at his female tormentor and ran off in the night, cursing her.

A male voice bellowed from the dark behind the woman, who was now laughing gleefully to herself as a storm of dark leathery wings passed by overhead, ""DAMN IT LILY, It is NOT a reaper's job to alert the infernals to the location of a wanderer! You are NOT a judge yet. The woman lifted the veil from her eyes, revealing black orbs that shone with the light of otherworldly constellations and said, ""And what would you have done to that sack of shit, your HONOR?"" ""That's not the point Lily. Get to your next appointment.""

With that, the strange woman vanished into the night, leaving the corpse of David Godfrey hanging from the wreckage of his car. And the side of the embankment. And a little on the other side of the road.

""Anyway, that's my story, kids. Just remember, that your misdeeds catch up with you."", the man said. Emily looked at her two friends, they too look bewildered by the man's strange tale. ""That was creepy mister, but the afterlife doesn't exist, and I doubt death looks like a hot blond."" ""Oh yeah kid?"" The man leaned over into Emily's face, taking his hat off as he did, ""Death can look however the hell we want."" Emily smelled lavender, and as she looked up only stars reflected in the man's black eyes. With that, the man vanished, and Robert, Emily, and Tim ran inside the store, screaming for the clerk.

Lily stepped out of the shadows and lit a cigarette, her veil covered most of her face as she took a puff with a smirk, ""You know Amos, scaring kids is against Judge's rules I'm pretty sure."" The man's voice rang out in the night, ""Stuff it Lily.""",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/eyu0e/lavender_and_cigarettes/

15,True story of my middle school.,1294513559,"I never really talked to anyone about this, so I thought I might post it on Reddit somewhere.

Anyway, years ago I went to a small private school outside of Boulder Colorado. I'll leave the name out for privacy purposes. Anyhow, when I first decided to attend this school, I learned various things about it, it's small size, the teachers. Most important out of what I learned was that the schools campus was formerly a convent. I thought nothing of this at the time, or throughout the time that I went there, for the most part.

The first time it crossed my mind again was when my art class decided to go downstairs from one of the classrooms. No one I knew who went there had ever gone down there, and frankly I was rather excited. The door at the bottom of the stairs was old, the wood was chipped away at in various places, and a general sense of decay was present. The door was locked somehow, but it was old enough that the hinges were askew, and the lock didn't meet the door frame, rendering any closing of the door useless. We made our way inside one by one. The basement was a very spacious area, lots of things on the walls and floors, most or all of which was uninteresting and commonplace for an old building. And indeed an old building it was, for the entire basement was covered with cobwebs and looked as if it hadn't been cleaned for a very long time. The trip was for the most part uneventful, but on the way back out there was something different than before, that I couldn't have seen on the way in. It looked to be the bones of some sort of animal, completely clean and arranged in a pile. Before I could get a closer look however, my teacher beckoned me upstairs, as my class was already back in the art room.

After this I began to think more about the origins of my school, how no one had told me why it was no longer a convent, or how the school had gotten a hold of it. I had little to no information about the place, and without much reason. This bothered me, but I didn't dare ask any of the teachers. I knew few of them had been there for long, and the ones that had were often busy.

I carried out my school days as normal for the remainder of the year, until about a week before graduation from the 8th grade. I was walking down one of the hallways to the locker room, about to leave. I casually glanced to my left and outside of the window that was around 3 feet off the ground, and suddenly saw a small girl in it, staring at me with wide brown eyes, expressionless and wistful. She had a cross around her neck. I can't remember what else she was wearing. I looked away and then immediately looked back, realizing what I had seen. She was no longer there, and when I went outside to investigate, no one was there either.


To this day I have told but one person about this experience, and still know little to nothing about the school.",nosleep,Gloomcircuit,/r/nosleep/comments/eykmn/true_story_of_my_middle_school/
16,The Mysterious Calico Cat.,1294502421,"I was up most of the night and part of the morning. It seems that staying up late has been a daily routine for me for quite some time now. I was starting to get tired as I often do before I ""try"" to go to sleep.

I have been a little bit OCD most of my life and do things a certain way before I got to sleep. 

* I never sleep in the dark.
* I always have the door closed
* I most certainly never sleep with my cat Wicket.

The last part which is ""not"" sleeping with my cat Wicket is a new thing I recently added.

We received Wicket from my brothers friend Mandy. Wicket was a gift. You see my brothers cat Midnight had recently died only a few days prior. It was a trade of old life for new life.

Wicket received her name because she was quite vicious growing up. She was not the nicest of cats. It didn't help that she was fed a slew of drugs from which my brother gave her on an almost nightly basis.

Trapped in a bag while people blow smoke into it is one form of torture that was commonplace.

Since then, at night she wildly runs about the house. Its as if she is being chased.

So as you can imagine as I'm playing World of Warcraft in the depths of the night, a cat running around the house can sometimes be a distraction.

On this particular night Wicket was acting strange. I didn't really keep it in the forefront of my mind, as I was just finishing a 4 hour bout of heroic 5 man's in Wrath of the Lich King.

I finally decide to pull myself from the laptop which I call home and drag myself up the stairs.  I notice that Wicket is not running around and that she is just lying down on the landing at the top of the stairs.

Perhaps she is just tired. What I missed and that I recall now is that she was shaking her eyes were wide and just staring at nothing in particular.

I'm finally in my room and I decided to break one of my rules. I leave the door open.

I'm not lying down but 5 minutes and Wicket comes ferociously flying into my room. She leaps onto my bead and puts me between her and the door.

I barely have a chance to look up at the doorway and I see a mist. It looks like a person. No not a person a small child.

I stare at the moving yet not moving mist as it swirls as if to look at me. Heartbeats pass between myself and the non corporeal being.

Before I have a chance to say anything it simply rushes me. It passes through me paralyzing me on impact. Cold chills flow through my body as if I've been stung by a thousand bees.

After what seems like an hour of not being able to move I finally come to. Wicket is shivering next to me.

I'm too scared to do anything. So I sit there trying to comprehend what just happened.

I finally came to the decision that this was my fault. I then proceed to remove the cat from my room and close the door.

To this day Wicket still runs around the house scared of something. I now ignore her almost completely and always close my door.",nosleep,MsReclusivity,/r/nosleep/comments/eyhxe/the_mysterious_calico_cat/
17,My true (but not scary) paranormal experience,1294490004,"This experience happened about 10 years ago when I was around the age of 13/14, but I still think about it all the time.

It was night time and my best friend at the time and his older brother (probably about 16/17)  decided to go play stickball (baseball but with a stick as a bat and tennis balls) in front of our grammar school that is right up the road from where we live.

We are playing stickball in front of the school where there is a grassy area that is on a very slight incline and at the top of the incline is the sidewalk / street. Not a very big area. We play til about 9:30 PM and decide to call it quits. At this point all 3 of us are standing together chatting in front of the school. We haven't collected the tennis balls yet so they are still scattered in the grass, across the street, etc.

My friends older brother is holding one tennis ball in his hand, turns to us and says Hey I will bet you that I can roll this ball into the grass and it will stop exactly between those two tennis ball in the grass. (There were two tennis balls about 15-20 feet in front of us, they were 1 foot apart from each other and were they directly across from each other).

Now the ""paranormal"" part. He rolls the ball, and all 3 of us are watching it intently, it goes up the slight incline and the ball pretty much makes it very close to stopping directly in between the 2 other balls however as his ball comes to a complete stop it completely vanished into thin air. We stood there, looked at each other in silence, we all saw what happened.

We looked all over the grass and could not find that ball or where it went. We tried to collect all the balls that were scattered about to see if we had as many as we came with, but we couldnt remember how many we came with.

Anyway, this is definitely a lame story to tell (it's even worse when I try to tell it in person) but that really happened. We rarely talked about it afterwards, I'm not sure why, maybe because we just had no explanation what so ever. Sometimes I wonder if all 3 of us staring at this ball made it disappear, or if it was some sort of glitch in the world we live in, or if it was paranormal.

Feel free to ask questions, but there isn't much else to the story, except a tennis ball disappeared right in front of my eyes. ",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/eyfwq/my_true_but_not_scary_paranormal_experience/
18,Please leave the room,1294486168,"The university I went to is almost a 100 yrs old but the most creepy history is when our country was occupied by the Japanese. Back in WW2 the Japanese took over Philippines from America and had a mass execution in our capital (not too different from the Nanjing massacre) Our university is run by Catholic brothers and have this small chapel inside the campus, at that time it was just an elementary/high school. When the Japanese came, they were all cornered in the chapel and the Japanese shot them all there and they said the floor was red and wet from blood after they were done. 

One of my favorite ghost stories in the university was that one professor was conducting a class. one of his students was coughing badly.

21,Two Columns,1294467467,"Loneliness is strange. It can get to a point so deep that the feeling itself can feel like someone is right there with you, even when you're totally alone. 


I find it doubly strange that one of the most profound questions one can ask is ""Are we alone in this universe?"" It's a question I still can't answer, but feel like I should. I had always liked thinking about aliens when I was young; the prospect of being from somewhere else flying around in space ships made me quite happy. But when you're a kid there is a lot you don't understand and a lot of it doesn't scare you. Unfortunately this does not hold up as much when you get older, at least for me.


When I was about eight we drove down the highway to my grandpas one night, and I stared out the window at all the halogen orange bulbs lighting the road, watching them all blur together into one soft line. After dinner I went running through the woods looking for toads with my three cousins (Michael, Andy and Kevin) and my younger brother Erich. The forest was beside my grandpa's house in New Jersey and under the cover of night it was quiet and still except for our feet shuffling leaves as we ran around the trees, laughing and slapping at the damp bark with our hands while making frog noises. Michael and I were the oldest and faster so we were up in front without flashlights, running along the patches of scant moonlight that were cupped silver by the upturned leaves. And seemingly as natural as a gust of wind, something stepped out from behind a tree that was in front of us. We stopped dead, not even skidding on the leaves until my brother and cousins ran into the back of us, dropping their flashlights in the process. We all screamed and turned to run. As my body turned my head stayed still as long as it could; it was skinny and the same color of that liquid silver the leaves contained, with two pale legs and thinner arms, one of which dangled by its side, the other wrapped around the tree. It's face was completely blank. No eyes, no mouth--just a horrifying texture of bumpy white stretched over a balloon shaped head.

We ran back to the front porch panting, but none of us were afraid, just startled. We thought that it was awesome; we had seen an alien and would live to tell about it. We debated going back out but our parents didn't like the idea of us running around at night and my brother got scolded for losing the flashlight. 

Now, both before and after this I watched shows about UFO's and aliens. And every time, after about thirty minutes of staring at the screen alone, I would find both my hands around my neck. I would find it hard to breathe and realize I was choking myself. Before the incident in the woods it had never hurt and I even thought it was kind of cool, but afterwards it would leave scratches and bruises around my neck and the terror I'd feel when I look into the mirror and see it would make me lie in bed awake all night with the lights on.

As I got older I didn't think much of it. I could watch Independence Day and scream ""Hell yeah!"" whenever Will Smith punches the alien in the face and says ""Welcome to Earth"" (even though I kind of related to the guy who kamikaze'd into the laser thing). I even would talk about what I'd seen from time to time when people talked about the weird and paranormal things they'd seen. I told myself it didn't matter if what we saw was real or not; it simply was and I'd never see anything like it ever again, so who cared? It just didn't make sense for something like that to travel billions of miles to come scare a bunch of kids in the woods (although Douglas Adams gives  some good ideas in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy). 

Junior year of college showed up and my roommate and I spent more time on the internet than we should have. One day we had the door open to let summer air sweep through the apartment when Sean sits down beside me on the couch with his laptop to show me a video. I drank my orange juice and he played a video showing different pictures of aliens. We both laughed at most of them, occasionally whispering ""What the fuck?"" at an autopsy photo. Then a photo came up, and the sensation of nausea hit me so hard I doubled over and threw up on the coffee table. The picture was of a completely white figure in the woods, partially obscured by a think branch of pine needles, but it had one arm wrapped around the tree with the other dangling by its side. And, of course, it's face was completely blank.

I didn't know what to think. Was some asshole running around New Jersey in their freakishly altered tights to scare kids? I didn't like it at all. I had told Sean about it and he stared at the picture while I clutched my chest, and then he stood up and cleaned up the orange spilling off the sides of the table. He's a nice guy (and owed me a vomit cleanup anyway).

25,My time in a university literally built on a Taino indian burial ground.,1294447930,"**If you don't feel like reading the long-ish back-story then skip to the stories in the comments.**

I recently graduated from Altos de Chavón School of Design in Dominican Republic last year. I spent the 2 most interesting years of my life there. The small school (125 students) is hidden inside a very popular tourist site in La Romana, Dominican Republic, if any of you have ever taken a trip down to the DR, you may have heard of it or even visited Chavón. The school was built in the 80's by an Italian architect to resemble a 17th century italian village. [Here's an aerial view of the plateau it's built on.](http://i.imgur.com/zghRW.jpg) It's common knowledge down on the island that Chavón was built on the remains of Taino villages (sickeningly stereotypical kind of place for paranormal activity, I know), there's even a museum in the center of the grounds that displays the artifacts and several skeletons of natives that were discovered in and around the area while the place was being constructed. It's also common knowledge to the students and staff that Chavón is a hotbed for paranormal activity.

Anyways, on to the interesting parts. I've got a couple things to share, so I'll probably be writing some down in the comments later tonight or right after I finish writing this one.

The first thing I wanna share doesn't even have to do with the history behind Chavón (at least I don't think so), but more with a well covered up event that happened a couple years prior to my enrollment at the school. Unlike living here in the states, it's very easy for things to be covered up from the media, especially in a place like Chavón run by filthy rich people with quite a bit of influence. There had always been rumors about a few suicides that happened in the school within the last few years. It wasn't till my second and last year studying there that the rumors were confirmed. The residence we lived in always had a supervisor (sorry if thats not the right word for it, I'm using the direct translation of the word). The lady was in charge of keeping order and also being the resident nurse. Anyways, the current librarian used to be the old supervisor a few years back, she was a really quiet lady and usually kept to herself. After spending a lot of time in the library researching for projects I decided to ask her if the suicide rumors were true, she told me they were, and that it really pained her to remember those days. I apologized for bringing it up, and went to go ask one of my teachers about it, she was younger and we had become good friends during my time at the school. She told me the same that the librarian did, and in more detail. Apparently one suicide had been a girl, a really quiet, depressed girl who had come to the school from the states. She apparently hung herself from the support beams of the wooden ceiling of her room. The second suicide was a guy, who turns out lived in room #8, which was my room. He went up to the third floor and jumped head first onto the stones in front of what was my room. [Here's a visual aid.](http://i.imgur.com/wlf5O.jpg)

27,Online shopping,1294443642,"I have a sort of addiction when it comes to online auction sites. I typically buy things cheap whether I need them or not; a broken camera, antique picture frames, a vinyl of a classic album. Things that no other human being would have any rhyme or reason for, but me.

A few days ago I found myself stumbling upon a rather peculiar auction, something from an estate that I found odd in itself as you never see something like that online, it was something that definitely caught my interests. It was nothing more than a simple figurine of a young man sitting in a chair looking at himself in a mirror. The man had a grimace of sorts across his face, and the surface of the mirror looked so worn down it barely shown a reflection.

As the minutes passed I studied this auction like no other, there were no bids on it even though it was priced dirt cheap, and it was the only thing posted by the seller. I simply had to have it.
Later that week my package arrived. To my own dismay I let the package lay there in the front foyer. I couldn’t bring myself to open it as even the sight of the package brought to me a sense of dread, as if I shouldn’t be owning it, or for that matter if anyone should be.

After several days of the package lying in my doorway I finally decided to open it. As I opened the last flap of the packaging I felt a sense of relief come over myself. I removed the figurine and set it on my dresser in the upstairs. I felt as if it needed a shine. The thing itself was extremely old; probably something crafted in the 1930’s or around that era and probably was never cleaned after it was stuffed away as some sort of forgotten heirloom.

I sat in my chair at my work desk, turned on the TV, as I always do, and slowly wiping away the dust and years of silver tarnish on the figure. While cleaning it the same sense of dread I felt from the package suddenly fell over me, like once again I shouldn’t be doing what I’m doing. I continued polishing the mirror, and as strange as it was I felt as if my own mirror was becoming tarnished. I ignored it and kept polishing it, I was determined to make it look as good as it did the day it was manufactured, that is until I felt uneasy.

I don’t think anyone ever realized what truly happened, just another case of a mad man gone missing reported on the news, a shut in with no family, no kids, nothing, gone forever with a body never to be recovered, and all of his things to be sold to random strangers looking for a good deal. I don’t think anyone will ever realize the grimace I have is from my final moment. That brief stretch of time when I realized that this is it. This is my fate…that is until the next buyer comes along.

EDIT: re-wrote the final sentence. thanks Timoboll!

30,My love is shimmering green,1294424117,"If anyone is reading this, you either have direct access to my computer or it finally reconnected to the internet and my macro program posted this online. I hope to God for your sake its the latter.

My name is Peter, and I live in an apartment above a country store about 10 miles outside of town. I won't reveal the exact location as I must prevent anyone else from meeting my fate. Suffice it to say it is in the southern portion of the United States where you can go from city to farmland in a matter of minutes.

I stumbled upon this place while driving through the countryside a couple of weeks ago. A sign on the door alerted me to the fact that the apartment above was for rent. I inquired with the store owner, a quiet old man who spoke in a thick Eastern European accent. I'm not sure where from I was afraid to ask and I admit I'm ignorant to that area of the world. One of my many regrets now. Anyway, the rent was cheap and it would give me a much needed break from life in the city at the end of a long day, so I took it. My lease was coming up on my apartment in the city and the time seemed right.

There's nothing interesting at all about the store itself or the apartment at all. The building sits just off the road in front of a dense copse of trees, The storefront itself is white with peeling paint, and the apartment is a simple 2 bedroom affair with a kitchen and bathroom. A staircase in the back room of the store leads directly up to the door of the apartment. 

Things were uneventful save for the occasional rustling of a tree branch against the window next to my bed up until two days ago. It was Friday. I had the day off and was looking forward to a long 3 day weekend. Unfortunately, my Landlord seemed to have become obsessed with clearing the trees around the property and had been muttering about green fire and spending these last couple of days mowing down trees with a chainsaw. I found it odd because when he first showed me around the property he was proud to tell me that he bought this spot because the trees reminded him of his homeland.

I didn't think much of it, figuring it was his property, he could cut down all the trees he wanted. I'm not captain planet after all. However, when dusk fell on Saturday, as I was typing away on my computer, I noticed a green glow flash briefly by my bedroom window. Then I noticed the silence. The Landlord's chainsaw had stopped. I had gotten so used to the noise that its sudden absence left me feeling unnerved.

I walked to the window and looked out into the trees behind the store. Sitting on a low branch was a pale woman with long, mossy green hair, singing a song that she's singing even now as I type this. I didn't understand the words, but they promised fulfillment. They promised ecstasy, pleasure, and warmth. I stood mesmerized before I noticed the object in her hands she seemed to be singing to. It was the bloody, disfigured head of my Landlord, his spinal column hanging by a thread from it..swinging lazily off the branch of the tree. I turned away and vomited.

Panicking I ran out of my apartment and down the stairs towards the store's awaiting door. 

But she was there now. Blood on her chin. Her eyes were empty pools of emerald green light. She smiled and began singing her song again. I froze. I wanted her. Emotionally, Sexually, Greedily. I wanted her more than anything. But as my landlord's blood dripped from her jaw...I regained my composure and ran back up the stairs, barricading myself inside my apartment. I've tried calling for help. The phone is dead. I've tried getting online. It won't work. She demands my full attention.

She's right outside my door now. Singing that song. Sometimes she stops and laughs. A laugh that breaks my heart with desire.

But it's different isn't it? She desires me.

I can be happy with her. In the trees. In the moss.

The landlord was cutting the trees down. Not me. 

Tell my family not to worry. 

I can be happy with her.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/ey0qi/my_love_is_shimmering_green/

32,A strange experience that really stuck with me.,1294395233,"   When I was around 4 to 5 years old I used to live in this really quiet neighborhood in Jersey. The house we used to live in was 1 floor with the attic converted into 2 other bedrooms, one mine and the other my sisters. We spent a lot of time moving around when I was younger (I grew up a diplo-brat) so my room never had much stuff in it, all I had was my bed on the far side of the room, directly under the only window in the room, in the corner near that was my toy box up against the wall. As a side note, me and my mom have always been very sensitive to the ""paranormal"".

   Anyways, there was one night where I was having a bit of trouble sleeping, and was kinda just laying there listening to the silence. A minute later I nearly crap my pants when my toy box lid slams shut, the box was one of those big plastic playskool ones, the lids not very heavy, but it closed so loud it gave the impression it was being slammed shut. I sat upright and stared at it for a while, terrified (I wasn't the bravest kid). I forgot to mention the attic that was my room had storage panels in the walls, little wooden doors all along the wall that you could slide open to store stuff inside the walls. Anyways, a couple seconds after I sit up to look at the toy box I hear a faint scratching coming from the other side of the panels, the hairs on my arms are standing on end remembering the sound. Just as I'm about to freak out and sprint out of the room to my parents, the scratching sound starts to move very quickly along the wall, and is if that wasn't horrifying enough at the time, the sound quickly reaches the opposite side of the room, travels the opposite wall, passes my door somehow, and comes down the other wall. At this point I am screaming for my mom and dad, and just as I jump out of my bed, the screen from my window unhinges and falls onto my bed. I didn't sleep in that room for at least a week.

 My parents tried to convince me I was just hearing mice inside the walls, but the scratching was too loud and it doesn't explain how it traveled to the opposite wall, not to mention the toy box slamming and screen falling. I'm 22 years old and just had to get up and turn on all the lights to type this. This is my first post on this sub, and I have a few other experiences to share, none that scared me as much as this one, but I had a really interesting conversation with my mom that explains a lot about one of the houses I used to live in, but I'll get around to posting that on here soon, maybe tomorrow.

**Edit:** *Changed quiet town to quiet neighborhood, I don't remember so much about the entire town as much as I remember about the immediate surroundings of my street.

So my mom is in the kitchen, and my dad is in the dining room reading a new paper. my sister (I don't have a sister in real life) asks me wanna try a scary seance? I say 'sure' being a skeptic of that stuff i doubt anything is going to happen. My sister tells me to repeat 'What is happening' 5 times without stopping, each time I say that she has to laugh really loudly each time I say it i have to be louder than her every time. I'm like ""Sure whatever."" We go into a room and shut all the lights (for the seance to work).
I start 'Whats happening?'
She laughs
I say it again 'Whats happening?'
She laughs louder
by the 3rd time my parents can start hearing it
She laughs harder
by the 4th time I'm almost yelling 'What happening?!'
she laughs harder
My mom yells at the same time I'm about to say the phrase the last time,'IS EVERYTHING OK?'
I get cut off and tell my mom ""WHAT'S HA- nothing mom!'
Just as I say that my sister's laugh just stops all of a sudden.
No scream or anything. I get freaked out and run to the door and turn on the light. I look back at my sister and she's fixed in this pose where her hands are on her back (kinda like when people are shy are posed) but her eyes are looking all over the place (like as if shes not in control of her body)
My mom runs into the room and looks at my sister whose frozen now and she grabs my sister and picks her up ( ike the way people pick up babies to burp them). My mom's turned away and I look at my sister and we make eye contact
and then she smiles and her eyes rolled up. Thats when I woke up.

38,I just wanted to watch TV.,1294364177,"So heres how it goes. This is my only experience with anything of the paranormal or anything that I couldn't explain through logical means. That being said I'm an avid believer of the paranormal. That however does not stop me from trying to explain things that are out of the ordinary.

Whatever, heres how this goes down:

Over the past summer I would hang out with my girlfriend at her house at nights since a) she was my girlfriend and b) she gets uneasy when shes home alone because she believes her house in haunted out the ass. Now I knew this girl for quite a while, she believes a lot of outrageous things that I always dismiss as her being herself. She was always however very serious about her fear of the paranormal, most other things shes skeptical about are mostly to joke around. 

Anyway, I stay with her for multiple nights since her mom has a night job and she has to stay in her rather large house by herself. We mostly just watch TV or play the wii. One night we stumble across a show called ""ghost adventures"". We watch it out of curiosity. Me because I love ghost related things, true or not,  and her out of that weird curiosity you get when you're scared. Like trying to take a closer look at a terrible car accident.

Anyway the program ended and I was disappointed but my girlfriend was scared out of her mind. She didn't want to leave the bed to turn on the lights so I got up to do it. As soon as I turned on the lights I heard a very audible *sigh*. I looked straight at my girlfriend and she looked straight at me. I didn't want to scare her so I didn't say anything. But before I could nonchalantly walk back to the bed she said ""please tell me you heard that, you looked straight at me when it happened"". I said ""was it a sigh?"". She nodded, still with a look of shock on her face. I stood next to the bed for a while and really thought about what the hell I just heard.

I had to change the atmosphere quick for her and myself, so I asked her if she wanted to go watch TV in the living room. Her cat jogged into the room and jumped on her bed. She usually calmed down when he was around. She agreed since there was a lot more lights in the living room than the bedroom. She went to pick him up to carry him with us but he was reluctant to move off the bed, it actually hissed when she tried to take him out of the room. This was extremely odd since hes always been a passive cat that does nothing but let people pick him up and bother him without retaliating.

We decided to leave him and walk down the hallway to the living room. The problem with this was the light switch for the hallway is all the way at the end of the hallway, opposite from the bedroom. We were in no mood for darkness so we just stayed real close as we left the bedroom.

We inched out of the room and started down the hallway. Then I heard a whisper, this time not faint, and not at all indistinguishable say ""stop"". It wasn't loud but it was clear as day and sounded like it came from right in front of us. We both ran the fuck back in the bedroom and locked the door. I didn't need to ask her if she heard it because she reacted before I could even turn back around.

We were quiet for a good 5 minutes after that. Then we tried to go to sleep with no avail. We ended up just watching courage the cowardly dog all night.

I have never been so damn scared in my life. Nothing has happened to me in her house since but she still tells me some of the stuff that happens when I'm not around. I really wanted to believe she was just being her old superstitious self when she told me her house was haunted, but I mean I was there when that event happened. I can't make fun of her anymore :(.",nosleep,KJakal,/r/nosleep/comments/exm4w/i_just_wanted_to_watch_tv/
39,"So, I found an interesting building near my house the other day...",1294360384,"A few weeks ago, on a peculiarly warm winter day, my girlfriend and I took an afternoon stroll through our neighborhood.  Our home is located in a small section of a big city and most of it was constructed late in the 19th century, including our house, which was built in 1880.  Although the neighborhood is relatively small, it was designed during an industrial boom, and homes, businesses, and roads were pretty much jammed in wherever the designer could find a space for them.  Because of that, there are many amazing nooks and crannies that you can explore by walking or riding a bike around.  On this particular day, we stumbled across an older church on a dead end road.  Although there must have been 30 churches built in the area, this one stood out because it included a rectory, convent, school, and some actual green space.  I still can’t believe we had never seen it before.  We crossed the over street and walked up to read the Historical Landmark plaque that was posted beside the church door.  Then, after testing the door and finding it unlocked, we went in.

It only took me two steps inside to realize we had found something special; it was the type of church that was built when these places were the center of the community and a staple of everyday life.  The high ceilings were painted with pastels, towering monolithic pillars were spaced evenly throughout the room, and the alter was glowing with gold and bright whites.  Each step I took would echo throughout the entire space.  In awe, I walked around a bit before my girlfriend felt a little odd about being in the place uninvited and unannounced, and suggested we get going.  She too was struck however, and though we are not religious and don’t attend church, she asked if we could come back for mass.  Interested in coming back to the building myself, I agreed.  We took at look at the mass times on the way out and saw there was only one each Sunday at 9 am.  

We had football tickets for the next Sunday so we couldn’t go, but the following week, we remembered the church and put on our Sunday finest and walked the few streets to the dead end.  There was no parking lot nearby, and the church was one of many in the area, so I wasn’t too surprised to not see anyone else heading in with us, but I was surprised to not hear church bells ringing as we opened the door right around 9 am.  We walked into the building and through the entryway.  This is where it started to get strange.  Almost every seat was full of people.  I thought that in itself was only partially odd, but the unnerving part was that absolute silence that enveloped the place.  There was no whispering, no coughing, no babies crying.  In this huge church inside of this huge city, 200 people sat in absolute silence.  We walked forward, feeling a bit odd while trying to find a seat.  There were apparently no ushers at this church, and we struggled a bit to find seating, finally locating two empty seats in one of the pews on the right side.  Oh, how I had hoped they would be the end seats so we didn’t have to be the ones to break the silence, but of course, they were not.  I walked up to the pew, and in a hushed tone announced my pardons.  No reaction.  None.  It was a family we needed to pass, a father on the end, his wife next to him, and two younger girls beside their mother, all of who were dressed rather strangely in droll but very formal and classic wear. I again said “Excuse me, sir” and again was completely ignored.  I was starting to feel weird at this point and even a little frustrated, and I decided I was going to end this awkward stand-off and just kind of nudge my way past them.  Looking back, this decision scares the shit out of me.  But then I only wanted to get to the seats so we could get out of the uncomfortable aisle.  I bumped my way through, as did my girlfriend.  The family just sat there, staring at the alter.  A few minutes later, mass began and I forgot all about the silence and the family.  It was a good service, albeit a long one, and it ended around ten after ten.  We joined the herd leaving the church with no signs of the earlier awkwardness.  There was general conversation, laughing, and pleasantries being exchanged.  My girlfriend and I walked abreast down the side aisle, and everything was fine until just before we reached the entryway.  The little girl who had sat next to us was walking directly in front of us on the way out, holding onto her mother’s hand.  She seemed happy that the service was over, almost skipping even.  She suddenly stopped prancing and turned to look me directly in the eyes, her curly blond hair spilling out of the white hat atop her head.  She only said four words.

“You shouldn’t be here.”

For a moment, I was fixated on the girl; it was like everything was on pause except for the feeling of my stomach dropping out of my ass.  My breath was caught and labored.  Then just as suddenly as the moment had begun, it started back up again.  I heard the laughter, the hellos and how are yous, and the girl turned back around and started skipping again.  Maybe it wasn’t a big deal, but we were outside and around the corner before I could start feeling almost normal again.  I looked at my girlfriend to ask her if she had heard the little girl, but she opened her mouth first.  

“Why the fuck was that?” she shrieked.  I had never seen her so panicked, and I thought, very much overreacting.

“I don’t know!  Why would she say that?” I asked.

My girlfriend looked confused.  “Why would who say what?”

I said “The little girl!”  Now I was confused so I asked her what she was talking about.

She said “Right at the end there.  When we were walking out.  I was looking at the paintings above the choir loft when it got perfectly quiet.  I don’t think I realized it at first, but once I did, I started drifting my eyes downward, and every single person in the loft had stopped filing out and was just staring at us.  Then I looked in front of us and around us, and everyone there was doing the same thing!  Even the priest stood at the door just staring!  What the fuck!  How did you not see that?”

I told her about the little girl and what she had said and we both just about freaked out right then and there on a busy sidewalk with cars rushing by on the road beside us.  We decided it was best that we never, ever go back to that church.  We went home, made some lame jokes about it and told the story several times over the next few days to our friends.  I thought that would be the end of it all, but I was wrong.

My next door neighbor is 92 years old and extremely proud of that fact, as she is sure to remind me at least once a week.  This week was no exception.  She called out to me from her front door as I walk walking to my car yesterday.

“Adam!  Could you please help me open this jar of sauerkraut?  It seems stuck.  I don’t know how they expect a 92 year old woman to be able to open these damn jars.”

I walked inside and helped her open the jar (which seriously was a pain in the ass, I’m not embarrassed to admit).  We started talking a bit about the holidays, her family, and some other small talk.  After a few minutes, I told her we had finally gone to church (she is always bugging us for not going), and decided to go ahead and tell her the whole story.  She didn’t say anything throughout the short tale, but seemed to be listening closely.  I went into a bit more detail about the place and the people within it than I did here as she seemed strangely interested in the experience.  When I had finished, she said slowly “You sure it was Atenade Church?  On 14th Street right over here?”  I confirmed that it was.  Then she dropped a bombshell.

“Adam, that church has been closed for over 30 years.  It’s a historical landmark, so it’s been in limbo until the city gets the money aside to restore it.”

I was flabbergasted.  I assumed she was just mistaken.  She was, after all, 92 years old.

She continued quietly “I used to attend that very church with my family every Sunday when I was a youngster.  It is a beautiful place.  I don’t think you should go back.”

I could feel the confused look spreading across my face, but wasn’t quite sure what to say.

She said “The descriptions you gave of the people in the church and the family…”  She paused for a second, then said “I’m not sure what happened to you, and maybe I am just being hopeful or crazy, but maybe you could look at something for me.”

She left the room for a second, and I hesitated, not sure if she wanted me to follow or wait.  After a few seconds, I started after her, but she returned, holding onto a picture frame.

She seemed a bit reluctant but went ahead and began speaking.  She said “In 1926, my parents and my two sisters died along with many from the neighborhood when a fire caused by a glass plant explosion swept through the row homes quickly and caught many asleep in their beds.  The wind was so strong that night, and it just dragged the fire right along with it.  I had fallen asleep on the couch with the dog, and I made it out of the front door while the second story burst into flames.  I had to wait outside for my parents to make it out the door.  They never did.  I felt guilty about it, and still do…I was only 8 years old…”

She held up the frame in front of her and said “This is the last picture my family took together.”

I gasped and put my hand over my mouth.  I couldn’t believe it.  There they were, gathered in front of a glowing fireplace, with warm smiles on each of their faces.  The father I had forced my way by in church was standing in the back with his arm around his wife, and three little girls in white dresses were sitting in front of them.  And there, on the right side, smiling to beat the band, was the girl with the curly blond hair.

40,Paralyzed,1294348298,"This isn't my story, just something I picked up along the way:

My son Jeremy died several years ago of cardiac arrest. He spent the last two and a half years of his life paralyzed from the neck down. When he was 22, he attended a fairly prestigious university, he got good grades and was even on the baseball team. It was his senior year and he was out partying with his friends one night, celebrating after a game, they were just...stupid kids. 

Drinking and driving, smoking drugs, there was an accident. The car went off the side of the road, down a deep ravine, my son was the only one who survived. He was lucky to be alive, but he had twisted his spine, the doctors told us he would never again feel anything below his neck. I quit my job to stay home and take care of him. His father had left us when Jeremy turned three, and he required constant care. 

Almost immediately after I brought him home, he began suffering from a deep depression that continued until he died, his last years were Hell for him. He suffered from paranoid delusions. The doctors said they were brought on by his lack of control, going from a young, aspiring athlete, to being stuck in a bed...not to mention his friends passing the way they did that night. 

Jeremy would often tell me that he wished he had died too. He had horrible nightmares, and developed a deep fear dark, he slept with a lamp on every night, and if the bulb ever burnt out, he would start screaming. He spent his days watching old movies on television or listening to books on tape, the kind he used to enjoy so much, but it always felt like he was just going through the motions, waiting for something, passing the time. 

About six months after I brought him home he began to tell me about a woman. When I would be away, in the kitchen, or outside gardening, he would see her. Just out of sight. Sometimes he would yell for me in  the night, claiming he heard scratching outside of his room, or whispers. I never found anyone in the house. After a time this evolved into more severe auditory and visual hallucinations, he began to hear laughing in the night, a scratching high pitched cackle.

 He would claim to see her outside his window, in the woods behind our house. He described her as “A tall old woman, in a long dress, with her neck twisted down.” We tried several kinds of medication, but nothing would lessen his delusions that this woman was haunting him. 

Six months before he died, with medical bills and monthly expenses piling up, I went back to my old job, and hired a nurse to look after Jeremy during the day. She was a very patient older woman named Alice, she got along well with Jeremy, she would read poetry to him, and was incredibly patient with his problems, she had a lot of experience with Alzheimer's patients and things were starting to look up. Jeremy still complained of the woman, but the nurse was helping, and we were working on getting him into a wheelchair, the kind he could control with his mouth. 
	
One evening I came home from work late, around 11:00, I had called that morning and told Alice I might be, and I knew something was wrong as I walked up to the house. All of the lights were off. All of them. Jeremy's light was never supposed to be off, he was deathly afraid of the dark. 

I ran into the house and heard a whimpering from the hall. Alice was lying at the bottom of the stairs, tears on her face, whimpering in a puddle of milk, it looked like she had fallen  down the stairs, I tried to help her up, but she stopped me, and said one word, “Jeremy...”, I ran into his room and turned on the lights, he was just looking out the window, into the darkness. I asked him if he was okay, and he didn't respond. I went back to Alice and helped her onto the couch, and called an ambulance. 

She had fallen down that morning, almost right after I left the house. She heard Jeremy yelling from his room and was running down to see what was wrong. He had been alone in his room all day and into the night. At first he wouldn't talk about it, then he told me what he had seen. The Old Woman had come to his window after Alice fell, she smiled at him, an awful grin, and laughed her raspy laugh. He described her as “freakishly tall”, seven or eight feet, with a crooked nose. 

Her dress was grey and covered in filth. By the afternoon she was in his room, standing over his bead, just staring at him, with her large black eyes, her neck craned impossible down. He said that, once it got dark, she whispered things in his ear. He never told me what, but it changed him. He stopped calling for me, and stopped talking, he said that he “accepted it now”. 

About a week after the incident, he died, sometime in the night. A heart attack. I miss my son, but his pain is over now. I think a lot about his nightmares, his hallucinations, and about the woman in grey. Sometimes, I find myself scanning the trees outside for any sign of her...but I never do. For that, I'm grateful.

41,My grandmothers spirit.,1294347784,"This story is true and it happened to me.

When I was a kid my parents and I lived on the outer edge of the suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio almost the country.  However, where we lived really has nothing do with it.  I just said that since most stories start that way.


My grandmother had ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease) and she passed away when I was 10.  It was spring time when she passed away and had the funeral.  The night after we buried her I had the strangest experience.


Our house had an intercom system and all the rooms had an intercom box.  I woke up in the middle of the night because there was loud clicking.  Since it was the middle of the night and my room was pitch black I could not see a thing.  I figured out that it was coming from the intercom in my room.  The clicking sound that it was making could only be made by pushing down the “talk” button.


Now where the intercom was located in my room was right next to the closet in my room.  My closet was not a walk in closet but was deeper than your average closet and had the only access (in the ceiling) to the attic.  Speaking of my closet it always freaked me out in there.  There was one time we had rearranged my room to have the head of my bed in the closet.  It only lasted one night; I end up sleeping on the floor outside of my closet that night.


So back to the clicking I was staring into the blackness of my closet try to see if there was an arm or something coming from the closet pushing the talk button.  I tried to stay as still as possible.  Finally my eyes just got to tired and I fell asleep.


When I woke up I told my parents about the clicking and they said that they heard nothing from the intercom in their room.  My dad said that sometimes the intercom outside when it got wet would cause the other one to act funny.  I agreed that it must have rained last night.  However, when I went outside to get the bus for school everything was bone dry.  Even in the future when it rained, the intercom never did the same thing.",nosleep,mostsleek,/r/nosleep/comments/exgwg/my_grandmothers_spirit/
42,My bizarre life thus far....,1294335587,"All my life have I seen the weird.  Though, in my current years it has calmed down slightly.

I have shared some of these hear in no sleep but I will now put all I can recall into one post for your displeasure.

Lets start at the start then shall we?

When I was a child, before memory really permits me to directly recall this particular story, my mother told me this.  I was in the bathtub, playing around, like a kid does.  Then she heard me start to converse with someone, rather than the goofy ramblings of a child at play.  I don’t remember what I was saying.  So she came back into the bathroom and asked me,

“Who are you talking to?”

“That man over there in the corner.” I said.

“What man?” replied my mother.

“The all black one, with the hat on!” obviously.

“Don’t talk to strangers.” my mother said.

Like I said I don’t directly have any memory of that, I was too young, and apparently I didn’t give a shit that I was talking to something from another world.

--------

A few years later, I recall this next event.  My mother was getting ready for something in the bathroom and I was in the hall chatting with her.  I was probably 5 or something just to give you a frame of time to reference.

So, everything was perfectly normal, just hanging out, getting ready and then it happened.  We both heard this crazy buzzing noise.  Had no idea, either of us, what it was.  We both went out into the hall and towards the living room to see if we could find out where it was coming from, whatever was making the noise.

When we got to the living room, we saw the whole room was bathed in some orange light.  My mom thought the house was on fire at this point, but it was something very different.  

We looked out the kitchen window, where the light and noise was strongest.  Outside near our telephone pole there were lights.  A few different colors, I believe red, green, blue and white?  But they were out there, casting a weird glow and buzzing, circling around in the air.  No clue what they were.

So my mom grabbed me and we hid in the back room till we were sure they had left.  Which they did not long after we hid.

46,The Middle of the Bedroom,1294318520,"So, I shared a really huge bedroom with my two brothers.  It was cool, I often wondered how people who had their own rooms could feel safe at night. You know, if you hear something freaky, you can always find out if someone else is scared.

Everything was sweet.  I was working on an awesome model car ( I was 12) and I always kept the parts in the box they came in. I left the box near the middle of the room.  I don't know why.  Seems a stupid place now.  It could have gotten stepped on.  But that's where I left it.  I was a kid.  

The rest of my model was on the desk.  

It's nearly time to go to bed and one of our cats starts hissing at the box.

I look at my older brother.  He looks at me and says there must be an animal in the box. I pick the lid off the box to see what's in it.  Carefully, so I don't get eaten by whatever is freaking out the cat.

Nothing.

The cat (her name was Minus) is still freaking out.  Hissing and growling.

So I pick up the box.  I move it to the top of a cupboard.  

The cat doesn't give  a fuck.  She just hisses at the middle of the fucking room.  Empty space.

I figure the cat is just retarded.  I pick her up and I move toward the centre of the room.

She goes FUCKING MENTAL.  She scratches and bites and before I know it i'm bleeding like a really depressed emo kid.

I don't know how we kept sleeping in that room and let that pass.  But we did.

Nothing else happened aside from my younger brother having one of those sleep paralysis dreams about seeing some ugly rotting fucker next to his bed.

But that was just a stupid dream.

I'll see if he'll sign up and share that story with you.

EDIT:  As an atheist and a skeptic I appreciate people trying to find reasons for the abnormal behaviour.  But nothing suggested so far can really explain it.  I've been over all of them myself.  My personal guess was that maybe she didn't like the smell of the model glue.  Or maybe it was the plastic that the little bits of model I hadn't used were wrapped in.  I did move it though and she still freaked out.

In fact I remember taking the model box down and putting it near her and she didn't care.  It was all about the middle of the room.

Who knows what it was. Maybe another cat snuck into the house and pissed there.   

Pretty spooky though.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/ex7s5/the_middle_of_the_bedroom/
47,This just happened... easily debunked as nothing but still freaked me out.,1294308879,"It close to 3am. My roommate and I were taking our per usual once an hour smoke break on our back deck. Our dog always follows us out and loves the chance to be outside no matter how tired she is. She had just woken up and is normally pretty lazy outside this late at night. She typically just does her business, mozies around a little, and comes back up on the deck to wait for us to finish smoking.

We live in a pretty big town, but out where we live it gets very, very dark at night. We can see to the edge of the yard, but not much further. The house backs up to a neighborhood park which is essentially just a huge field.

The dog starts to go ballistic. Her hair is raised all the way from her neck to her tail. She's barking at seemingly nothing. Then I see them. Eyes. Two eyes are staring right at me. I mumble, ""What the fuck..."" under my breath and my roommate asks me what it is. I point out what I see. I set my cigarette down and tell my roommate to keep an eye on that thing while I go to grab a flashlight. I want to know what's staring at me.

Of course I couldn't find the flashlight. I come back outside to the dog still flipping out and my roommate telling me he lost track of it. We can't figure out what was staring at us. The position of the eyes were too close together to be a deer, and the height of the eyes made this creature seem very tall. What did we see? As far as I thought human eyes didn't glow from light reflecting off of them.

When we go back out for our final smoke of the night, the dog freaks out again, but this time we don't see a thing.

I won't be going outside to smoke alone at night for a while.

Joe was well-liked among everyone in his neighborhood, particularly one younger boy who saw him as a brother-figure. As you can imagine, the boy's parents didn't know how to explain to their son what had happened to Joe, so they told him he was still over in Iraq.


A couple weeks later, the boy got up from the dinner table, wandered outside, and several minutes later returned. When his parents asked where he had been, he replied ""I was talking to Joe."" Shocked, his parents asked him what Joe had said. ""He said he was sorry and he didn't mean to pull the trigger.""

50,It was a beautiful morning...,1294298806,"It was a Saturday morning. I opened my eyes: 9:34AM. The sun was streaming in through the window. Finally a chance to sleep in. I rolled out of bed and went to the bathroom. Climbed back under the covers to doze off again...

Suddenly, something came into my room. It did not walk, or run. It thundered toward me, footsteps coming quickly. I couldn't move. I thought I was having a seizure at first. My eyelids began to flicker but could not open, and the red light of flames was right before my face.

Two strong hands grasped my wrists and held me down. I was petrified.

""GUESS WHO THIS MIGHT BE"" growled a demonic voice into my ear. I was shaking, shuddering, I could not move or break from it's grip on my arms. Flames scalded my eyelids, and in desperation I called out, but only in my mind: help me. I could not move.

Suddenly it was gone. I was lying in bed, sunlight streaming through the window. I looked down at my wrists and could feel where the hands had moments before been crushing me. 9:39AM.

52,in two different worlds.,1294293125,"about 3 years ago when i was 19 i had gotten home from gym and flopped on the bed exhausted. i was laying on my back looking up at the ceiling just day dreaming and i finally drifted off. id say it was about 7 p.m. well i was having a dream that i was running through a field.
   
The field was somewhat like the elephant bone yard from lion king mixed with a field of somewhat tall thorny stalks but not of corn. pretty much just the stalks without corn, anyway. i was running through this field being chased by something, the moon was full and quite big if i remember correctly a little to big almost like i was 10x closer than usual. to this day all i remember from what was chasing me when i looked back was that it was on all fours running after me, eyes burning red almost like flares but with a hint of flames, it was jet black very scruffy looking, and its breath showed perfectly in the moonlight.
  
 i was running through this field i could hear the creature breathing hard and panting. i eventually tripped over what i think was a root and when i hit the floor it was like i hit it with such an impact i broke some type of barrier between that world and reality. i could see the posters on my wall along with the ceiling then a fine line, and then the bone yard i was in. i wasn't able to look back but i could feel the creature behind me growling and breathing right next to my ear, my body went stiff i couldn't move. i tried turning around but all i could move were my eyes back and forth. i remember seeing a light on in the hall way and yelling mom very loudly then yelling my brothers name.
   
i got no answer from anyone. i tried so hard to move but couldn't getting very frustrated laying their i could feel my heart pounding very hard and i started breathing very heavily. the creature stutter stepped a little backward and then lunged forward and right as it opened its mouth and bit right between my neck and right shoulder i broke out and shot up out of my bed grabbed my neck turned the lights on and tried to calm down. the only thing i noticed was that my neck area was a little red and burned slightly.
   
i walked into the other room where my mom and brother was hoping they would say why were u calling us, but they didnt. i eventually asked them didnt you hear me calling u guys and they said ""no u never said one word"".

then a few months later i got my hands on some salvia, did it pretty much all night with my friends and went home. finally got home and ready for bed and fell asleep. i was back in the same bone yard, the same creature chasing me i fell in almost the exact same way but i woke up and swear to this day i saw the creature jump from one side of my room to the other and through the wall almost like i had tripped as it had jumped toward me and right over me. im 22 now and i have never had that dream since.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/ex2zw/in_two_different_worlds/

story sum up: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moll_Dyer &lt; haunts my house maybe?

my home sits on top of a hill in the middle of 15 acres of woods (really nice in the spring and winter :D) 

burnt down ""ruins"" in the middle of the woods, no vegetation there grows

 but this is the story that tied with that one for ones that creeped me out the most! (there's a close second if you realllllyyy want more?:

so i'm in my basement playing the original red faction on ps2 (&lt;3) with not a light on in the house and i'm home alone. i'm younger in this story, about 12/13 and my brother is out being around 19/20 at this age and it being around 8PM. My mom was walking our german shepard at the time so she was out of the house, not on the property. And once again in this story my father is at work because of his night shifts with dubya. (secret service, see first story)  So i hear what sounds like boots slowly decending from the top floor (the location of story one) and down in front of the front door. This freaks me the fuck out cause i'm alone so i do the only sensible thing at that age. Go in the toy chest and grab my blue lightsaber and attempt to confront what's making the noise.

""hello?"" i said, hoping not to get an answer although i always wonder what it would be if i did. Nothing happened. I went down stairs thinking ""oooookay ghosts, gtfo. i'm playing red faction."" so then i go back down stairs with no lights on still. playing for MAYBE two minutes when i hear the same heavy boots slowly pace across the linoleum hallway leading from the bottom of the first stairs and front door to the top of the stairs to the basement. so i'm thinking holy fuck, there's no ghosts at all, this is tooooo clear. someone broke the fuck in.

so then, of course having played too many video games, i say fuck the lightsaber and i legit grab my compact bow and string an arrow and draw it ready to fire thinking we were getting robbed. so i search the whole house, only relaxing the bow string to use a hand to turn on lights. i searched the whole house (even closets) and turned on every light (even closets' lights) and there was nothing. i put the bow back, left the lights on, and continued playing despite having that cold feeling of being watched.

i turned the volume on the game down so low i could barely hear anything so that should anything come towards me i'd hear it. a couple times i could've sworn i felt breathe on the back of my neck but when i turned around nothing was there. I was already regretting leaving only the basement light off because it glared on the tv. but then i heard the boots coming down the stairs to the basement, and the sound of a hand sliding along the wooden hand rail in rythm with the heavy thuds of the footsteps. i turned around and i saw a silhouette cast from the light coming from at the top of the stairs. i felt cold and sat dead still as i saw it come closer and closer to the bottom of the stairs i sprang up and looked away only to hit the light switch. as soon as i did i looked back and it was gone completely. sound and shadow alike.

I searched the whole house and no one was there. i spent the remaining 30 minutes with my back against the wall staring at the stairs waiting to hear my mom and our dog to come back from their walk.

54,A recurring ghost,1294283450,"After I moved out of my house for college, my dad told me that he always thought our house was haunted, or was at least weird, for one reason:


We had [this kind of cable box](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3375/3298454963_068a3b8b20.jpg). If you had it, you know the *ZZZZZ^ZZZIP* sound it made when you ran the dial from one side of the box to the other.


He said that on many nights, he'd wake up in the middle of the night and hear the zipping noise, faintly, coming from the downstairs living room. He never thought much of it; maybe he was dreaming the first several times, maybe he was just hearing things, never had a reason to bring it up to the kids, etc.


I remember a time when the people we bought the house from came by, years after we moved in, to see how their old house looked like while they were near the area. One of the women pointed to the corner of the living room, saying to her sister/cousin/whomever ""That's where grandpa died.""

55,This is why I fear the dark. And I will never again challenge the notion that other... things exist.,1294281113,"I was originally going to type this out at work, as I don't usually explore the paranormal from home. Well, not anymore anyway. Not after last time. I feel like I was taunting them, and I got what I deserved. 

Ever since childhood I can recall pondering and questioning things. I was suspicious of the Santa Claus lie, so much that I actively worked to catch my parents setting the presents. I did. I was five. God was never a firmly-held belief, it was always more of a guilty feeling, something to fear. I am now an atheist and very scientifically inclined.

When I was in first grade my parents moved from Ottawa to El Salvador, my dad's birth country. We moved into this 3-bedroom two story house owned by my aunt. It had been build about five years previously, and the only occupier before that was my aunt. Before that, the land was a coffee grow. So, no real history, no one died there, as far as I'm aware.

I was young, so I was always afraid of going upstairs by myself. Once I would get to the top of the stairs, I would run towards the wall about 10 feet in front of me to flick the light switch. I always made sure I didn't look into the rooms before I did so. Once the light was on, I was safe. It took some work, but I finally got over my fear. This occurred by the time I was around 11, or 12.

It didn't last long. I am 21 years old now. I fear the dark. 

THE SPIRAL AND THE LADY

First, sorry, but some background (as if there's not enough yet): As you enter my home, you will be in the living room. To your left is a bathroom, and some steps, which make a U-turn and go upstairs. To your right is the living room, ahead is the dining room, yard. As you get upstairs, ahead of you is a wall with the light switch, next to the bathroom door. To the right of you are two doors: The first is my sister's, the second mine and my brother's. To your left, and in front of my shared room, is my parent's room. Above you, about twelve feet high, is the ceiling. So from the spot where the stairs turn to go up, to the ceiling above, there is an 18 feet or so high gap. (clarification can be provided if requested)

The upstairs is the setting for the following story.

My first unusual experience in that house was very low-key. It would have gone unregistered and forgotten if it weren't for the fact that someone else saw it too. I was lying in bed, wide awake, listening to everyone in the house snoring in their deep slumber. I was looking at my parent's bedroom door, since my bed was facing it at the time. About four feet from the floor, on the door, was this faint, almost not there... Spiral. It would slowly wind into itself, disappear, then pop back into existence. Rinse and repeat. The entire process would take about five seconds. I remember thinking it was ""gathering"". I don't know what that means, but I do remember thinking that. I stared at it for a few minutes until I finally just shrugged it off and eventually found my sleep. You see, it was so damned faint that I could have believed it wasn't there. Plus, I didn't believe in ghosts and shit.

In the morning, while having cereal, I spoke of this weird faint spiral I saw. My sister immediately looks up and says ""Hey I saw it too!"". She's just my stupid little sister, I thought, seeking my attention. So I didn't give her any more clues: I told her to tell me what she saw, exactly. I vividly remember her tracing the pattern of the spiral in the air, while she was telling where it was, and how it faded into itself before popping back to existence.

But after she confirmed my sighting, I recall finding it strange but not scary. I now have this theory that, had I stayed up, I would have lost my mind that night. I don't know why, but I feel like that was the lady, gathering energy or something. I don't fucking know. But this is where the mildness ends.

Fast forward to about a year later.

For some reason I kept waking up every night for about two weeks now. It was always at a time when everyone was asleep. I would just wake up, and be wide awake for like felt like hours before falling back to sleep. It was one of these nights, and I was wide awake. We had rearranged our room, so that my bed was against the wall next to the bathroom, so I had a diagonal view of the hallway and the top of the stairs. I turned left while lying down, and when I did, I caught something white on the corner of my eye. I turned to look at it and saw a white, long shape floating about two feet below the ceiling, high up above the steps. My first reaction was to look away, to face the wall. Then my mind immediately got to work: What the fuck was that? I remember trying to figure out what it could be. But I could not find a reasonable explanation. I knew my house well. And I knew there was nothing that looked remotely like it anywhere around. There was a window nearby, but it was facing the wrong way. And anyway, it doesn't fucking matter, because my inquisitive (stupid) little mind told me I had to find out what it was. So I sat up, leaned forward and stared.

It was a fucking lady.

As my mind processed the details my body tightened and my brain attempted to jump out of my skull. My eyes burned every fucking horrible detail into the back of my skull, so I can handily keep it with me until my death. She was facing the wall. Her hair was long, almost down to her waist.

I am being 100% honest. I don't want to keep writing about it. I almost had a panic attack. It's been a while. I think you got the idea. Nothing much happened after anyway, just the details... I don't like the details.

EDIT: Wow 40+ votes already! Thanks guys. I seriously thought I was boring you all to death. Gimme like eight hours, and I'll see if I can fire up another thread full of stories that people told me. No guarantees. Might have to wait till tomorrow, since I'll be home alone later tonight, and I'm not fucking around here when that happens.

**A REQUEST**

But wait, there's more! I don't have any video proof or anything, but if you wish to look at something very similar to the lady (but without the horrible details), try searching for ""Junkyard ghost"". It's a video I saw on the news a few months after which made me SCREAM when I saw it. It's just surveillance footage of this white figure floating around this car... The car was wrecked earlier that day and some lady died. Look at it at your own discretion, because I will admit that I think that video is real. Let me know if you find it, I'll put the link up here.

56,"I've read lots of stories here. This one is my personal story. This is why I am an adult and I fear the dark. Also, some words of advice to my fellow nosleepers.",1294278147,"I was originally going to type this out at work, as I don't usually explore the paranormal from home. Well, not anymore anyway. Not after last time. I feel like I was taunting them, and I got what I deserved. 

Ever since childhood I can recall pondering and questioning things. I was suspicious of the Santa Claus lie, so much that I actively worked to catch my parents setting the presents. I did. I was five. God was never a firmly-held belief, it was always more of a guilty feeling, something to fear. I am now an atheist and very scientifically inclined.

When I was in first grade my parents moved from Ottawa to El Salvador, my dad's birth country. We moved into this 3-bedroom two story house owned by my aunt. It had been build about five years previously, and the only occupier before that was my aunt. Before that, the land was a coffee grow. So, no real history, no one died there, as far as I'm aware.

I was young, so I was always afraid of going upstairs by myself. Once I would get to the top of the stairs, I would run towards the wall about 10 feet in front of me to flick the light switch. I always made sure I didn't look into the rooms before I did so. Once the light was on, I was safe. It took some work, but I finally got over my fear. This occurred by the time I was around 11, or 12.

It didn't last long. I am 21 years old now. I fear the dark. 

THE SPIRAL AND THE LADY

First, sorry, but some background (as if there's not enough yet): As you enter my home, you will be in the living room. To your left is a bathroom, and some steps, which make a U-turn and go upstairs. To your right is the living room, ahead is the dining room, yard. As you get upstairs, ahead of you is a wall with the light switch, next to the bathroom door. To the right of you are two doors: The first is my sister's, the second mine and my brother's. To your left, and in front of my shared room, is my parent's room. Above you, about twelve feet high, is the ceiling. So from the spot where the stairs turn to go up, to the ceiling above, there is an 18 feet or so high gap. (clarification can be provided if requested)

The upstairs is the setting for the following story.

My first unusual experience in that house was very low-key. It would have gone unregistered and forgotten if it weren't for the fact that someone else saw it too. I was lying in bed, wide awake, listening to everyone in the house snoring in their deep slumber. I was looking at my parent's bedroom door, since my bed was facing it at the time. About four feet from the floor, on the door, was this faint, almost not there... Spiral. It would slowly wind into itself, disappear, then pop back into existence. Rinse and repeat. The entire process would take about five seconds. I remember thinking it was ""gathering"". I don't know what that means, but I do remember thinking that. I stared at it for a few minutes until I finally just shrugged it off and eventually found my sleep. You see, it was so damned faint that I could have believed it wasn't there. Plus, I didn't believe in ghosts and shit.

In the morning, while having cereal, I spoke of this weird faint spiral I saw. My sister immediately looks up and says ""Hey I saw it too!"". She's just my stupid little sister, I thought, seeking my attention. So I didn't give her any more clues: I told her to tell me what she saw, exactly. I vividly remember her tracing the pattern of the spiral in the air, while she was telling where it was, and how it faded into itself before popping back to existence.

But after she confirmed my sighting, I recall finding it strange but not scary. I now have this theory that, had I stayed up, I would have lost my mind that night. I don't know why, but I feel like that was the lady, gathering energy or something. I don't fucking know. But this is where the mildness ends.

Fast forward to about a year later.

For some reason I kept waking up every night for about two weeks now. It was always at a time when everyone was asleep. I would just wake up, and be wide awake for like felt like hours before falling back to sleep. It was one of these nights, and I was wide awake. We had rearranged our room, so that my bed was against the wall next to the bathroom, so I had a diagonal view of the hallway and the top of the stairs. I turned left while lying down, and when I did, I caught something white on the corner of my eye. I turned to look at it and saw a white, long shape floating about two feet below the ceiling, high up above the steps. My first reaction was to look away, to face the wall. Then my mind immediately got to work: What the fuck was that? I remember trying to figure out what it could be. But I could not find a reasonable explanation. I knew my house well. And I knew there was nothing that looked remotely like it anywhere around. There was a window nearby, but it was facing the wrong way. And anyway, it doesn't fucking matter, because my inquisitive (stupid) little mind told me I had to find out what it was. So I sat up, leaned forward and stared.

It was a fucking lady.

As my mind processed the details my body tightened and my brain attempted to jump out of my skull. My eyes burned every fucking horrible detail into the back of my skull, so I can handily keep it with me until my death. She was facing the wall. Her hair was long, almost down to her waist. Her dress was gown-like. Her feet were floating... angled downwards, with slipper-like shoes. 

I am being 100% honest. I don't want to keep writing about it. I almost had a panic attack. It's been a while. I think you got the idea. Nothing much happened after anyway, just the details... I don't like the details.

58,My ghost story,1294263885,"This happened a good few years ago.  I was driving through Arizona on I-10 W between Tucson and Phoenix.  It was about 1 AM and the freeway was pitch black and I don't remember seeing another soul for some time.

I glanced at my rear view mirror and a speck of light was in the distance behind me, but it was closing fast.  I assumed it was highway patrol so I brought my speed down to the limit.  Before I knew it, the headlights of the vehicle behind over took me.  Whoever it was, was on my tail.  I adjusted my rear view mirror and could make out a truck, older model, maybe a 1960's Chevy.  In the cab were three people: The driver was a male with a horseshoe type mustache (aka the Hogan), in the middle was a younger woman who seemed rather emotionless, and in the passenger seat was another male, but non-descript.  They all seemed typical working class.

It was just them and me on the desolate freeway and they rode my tail for a bit.  Finally, the light shifted in my car as they went to pass.  However, they didn't move any further than the 8 o'clock position.  Here's where I thought they were just screwing with me.  Finally I looked over my shoulder and light vanished.  There was nothing there.

I don't know if it changed but at the time, this stretch of I-10 was separated by a ditch between the East and West sides.  This kept people from doing U-turns if they decided to haphazardly change direction.  There was no way it turned around at the 75 speed limit without causing an accident.

""Bullshit."" I said.

Bullshit. Boy was I wrong. Never before have I become so addicted to a subreddit than this one. I usually browse a sub for a few minutes and move onto the next one. Even the few that REALLY grab my interests. Not this one, no. I have been here for almost three straight days, about 6 or 7 hours a day, reading every submission. I am currently about 4 months deep. I haven't had a good nights sleep since I started, but I can't stop. 

I have had paranormal things in my life since I was a child (some truly scary events), so I have always been drawn to figuring out what it was. The ""truth"" behind them. I know that the rule here is **Everything is True**(Even if it's not). I know that there are a large number of fabricated things here, but there are some true ones. There. Are. Some. True. Ones. 

I am not alone in the shit that has happened to me, and there are things that my feeble mind cannot explain. There are things in the dark, and scarier than that, there are things in the light. 

This subreddit reminds me of them. Informs me. Let's me know I am connected to others who know these things, and reminds me of how defenseless I actually am against things which are not ""every day"".

* All lights must be off: computer speakers, cell phone flipped over. I always prefer to sleep in a PITCH BLACK room. I have my small basement window covered with books so no street light gets in. I can sleep well in bright light or pitch black. I hate the in between when little lights are dimly illuminating the room.
* Door to my bedroom must ALWAYS be closed. I can't sleep with it open. I like to imagine a magic shield goes up when the door clicks closed to protect me from the paranormal :)
* I leave the closet door open, always. Although it doesn't bother me as much as it used to when I was younger.

62,A lesson on what not to do...,1294246749,"I just wanted to share a little story about one of the dumbest things I did back in high school. 

Like a lot of us, I experimented with drugs when I was younger. On this fateful evening, I had three hits of blotter acid left. I was at my parents house and had just gotten some great horror movies from a friend of mine earlier in the week, so I decided to drop the acid and watch the first movie I pulled out of my backpack. 

Now, hindsight is 20/20, but I still can't believe I decided to watch a horror movie in the dark, by myself, triping balls. Well, I pulled my computer chair up close to the t.v., reached my hand into the gaping maw of doom, and pulled out The Descent. 

Now, I was supprised, because I didn't remember my friend mentioning this movie, and at this piont, I had never heard of it before. So I popped it in, wondering what I was about to put myself through. 

Two hours later I was still glued to my chair, too terrified to move. I just knew the bat people had some how sensed my fear and were digging their way into the crawl space under the house. The only thing I could think to do was watch another movie. I reached my hand down, and to my left, to where the backpack was still agape. The only light in the room was coming from the t.v., and my vision was shot from staring at the blue DVD screen for the last 20 minutes. As my hand withdrew from the bag, something brushed against my arm.

I froze. ohmygodohmygodohmygod they got in the room theyre gonna eat me I don't have a weapon noone will ever know what hapened to me I'm not ready to die!! And with that I stood up and turned around to face my attacker. Nothing was there. I checked the ceiling and the walls. Nothing. Suddenly, motion from behind my chair. It was too dark for me to see what, but then I heard it.

64,My house is haunted. For sure.,1294215227,"So i've known this since i moved into my new house (which was like 7 or 8) but i'll be 20 in march so i've had quite a while to get used to it and research it (as have my friends since we frequently tape certain parts of the house while we sleep). I have like 20 some stories but i think this is a tie for first so i'll tell this one.

So this happened when i was like 17 (still in high school) and to really get how fucking weird and creepy this was you have to understand the layout of my top floor. (top down view) Imagine a square, and up the middle from the bottom is stairs. then to the bottom left is a guest room with two twin beds (usually grandparents when they visited). to the left is a bathroom, the the top left is my brother's room (who has moved out being 24 at the time) and to the top right is my room and to the bottom right is my parents room. other than that there is about a 4x4 landing at the top of the stairs that lets you navigate to which ever door you're up there for with a light at the top.

ok so on with the fucking story!

so i had just finished brushing my teeth which i hate doing up there alone cause it's an electric tooth brush and i always feel like it makes my presence known while preventing me from hearing things i usually try and ignore, such as footsteps, thumps, passing-inaudible whispers, etc. Well i'm up there doing it anyway and my mom is downstairs asleep on the couch in front of the news and my brother is in the basement below her, out like a light in front of robot chicken (lol) and my dad works nights at the white house (secret service) so he was at work till 6:30 AM and this was about 1:15AM. and as i finish brushing my teeth i notice that as i'm about to turn off the light of the bathroom the only light on is at the top of the stairs, but i reason telling myself that's enough to get me the three feet to my door. 

So as soon as i take two steps out of the dark bathroom a hear a faint whisper almost as if the chin of the woman speaking it is resting on my right shoulder (making her origin the guest room) barely, hoarsely, whispering, ""who's there?"" I audibly shout ""HOLY SHIT!"" and turn around to see nothing so i flip the light on in the bathroom, then guest room, then my brother's room, then my room and finally i'm about to do to the ""lean in"" to wipe my hand up the wall to hit the light that's in the dark doorway to my parents room because it's always the darkest in their room.

as i do the lean in i hear the same voice, same hear, right at my shoulder, almost feeling the breath on my ear's peach fuzz say, ""Help me."" So naturally i hit that light and slammed my back against the nearest wall so it would stop being behind me and i could see it. of course, nothing there, so i go downstairs and see my mom is still out like a light and i wake her up and tell her.  After she tells me ""yeah, the ghosts have been active lately, but they're leaving me alone so do the same and let me sleep."" 

&lt;_&lt; thanks

go downstairs, do the same thing to my brother and accuse him of fucking with me. ""Nah, i didn't but if i had i would take credit for it because you sound like you about shit your pants haha!""

&lt;_&lt; so supportive guys

slept awfully, and get chills everytime i tell this story! if you want more let me know! i picked this for first out of everything else because voices and ""help me"" scare the fuck out of me. the other first is a shadow one but let me know! oh and the file size is monstrous... but the tapes mentioned at the beginning have voices and thumps and footsteps on them all the time so i know i'm not just hearing things! haha

71,I thought about closing my eyes and going back to sleep but,1294141050,"I awoke to a pitch black room, which is surprising because there's usually some trickle of light through my windows.

The strangest sensation came over me as I struggled to make sense of what was happening. I felt as if I was being watched from the corner of my room. A tall dark figure appeared as lights from a passing car broke the cover of darkness and illuminated the room. 

What I saw made my stomach twist and the hair on my arms to shoot up with fear.
It was a young woman with her back turn towards me. Her long black hair was in contrasted to the white gown she was wearing. 

The passing car light slowly weaken as the darkness began to take over once more.  

The urge to remain completely still was overwhelming and I felt the need to disregard all logic and agree with my fear. I was to remain motionless until she disappear, a plan that was quite frankly my only option.

I thought about closing my eyes and going back to sleep but I couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that she was still there, watching me. 

Another car passes by but this time the lights barely breaks through the darkness. 
I see her again, walking backwards towards my bed, her steps are inhuman, almost mechanic in a way.

Both car and light disappear and I am once more in the depths of darkness.
A cold hand is placed on top of mine, I remain still. I feel a weight on the bed crawling closer towards me. She is now no doubt beside me as I can hear her breathing. Short shallow breathes, in and out, in and out, she reeks of death. 

The smell fills the room and I gasp for air. As I jumped out of bed, the room slowly fills up with the familiar light from the streets. I flick on the bed room lights and notice a thick cloud of smoke in the room. I cover my mouth with my sleeves and open up my bed room window. 

I stick my head out and take in a deep breathe of air. I couldn't help but notice that the smell was even stronger outside. There, in the middle of the road, were two police officers and a medic, all of which were working franticly on the burnt body of the woman I saw. Her entire body shot out mist of steam that seem to gracefully dance in the street light. Her eyes seemed to be fixed on me and I couldn't do anything but return the gesture.

72,Just had the most horrifying (possibly paranormal) night of my life.,1294139362,"It is 4am as I write the story of a night that I will probably never forget for as long as I live. About three hours ago, three friends of mine were looking out of the living room window of the house where we usually hang out. Before two of the three were there, the resident of the house and I decided that we needed to make tonight count, since we were heading back to our on campus residence within the next day. Our night truly began as one of the three spotted something very peculiar in the night sky. The combination of our adventurous attitudes and our desire to have a memorable night lead us to the conclusion that this abnormality needed to be investigated from a better vantage point. 

We drove to a somewhat popular location in town that we felt had the best view. At this hour of night, there was not a single person around where we were. All that could be seen were the lights of the houses occupying the bank of the river below our outlook and a lighthouse NONE OF US have ever seen in our 15+ years of living in this particular city. Our curiosity was roused as the oddity in the sky slipped from our minds and from our sight. Our destination changed… to the lighthouse.

We migrated across the river and traveled down the road to where we believed the lighthouse was supposed to be. A small rest stop on a back road caught our attention as we tried to regain our bearings. We walked out of the car and looked around as our eyes adjusted to the pitch black night. I don’t think I have ever had a better view of the clusters of stars and constellations as I have had tonight. We sat in awe for about 5 minutes or so, until all four of us heard a very low, repetitive growl that evolved into a medium pitched shriek. Our group immediately sprinted to the car, and at that moment, I saw three white, almost fluorescent, perfectly upright bodies, standing about 5 feet equidistant from each other on the plateau of a hill that stretched out into a forest that faced us and the back road that lead us here. My impulse and instinctual disbelief that these were just trees and not anything out of the ordinary was soon turned to terror as my pupils dilated and the rightmost 7-foot figure began to move to its right. All of us scrambled into the car, and got THE FUCK out of there. I looked over at the rest of them and asked if they saw what I saw. The driver and my campus roommate said no, but the other just stared at me as he soon augmented my brief description of the pale trio. It was at that second that the probability that my mind was just playing tricks on me had significantly decreased.

After much discussion, we decided to go back. I didn’t see the three again. However, everyone but the driver kept seeing very brief flashes of light that littered our view of the forest. To my left, I noticed a smaller concentrated flash of light that to me most closely resembled a flash light oscillating between its on and off states. This lasted for about 10 seconds before I felt the need to alert the others. Nobody else had seen it for the duration of its oscillations.

I suppose the majority of these observations could be debunked. The growling turned screech could have very well been an animal… although, to everyone there, it was very reminiscent of a human. The three figures might have been trees, but all of the trees in the forest were brown and there were two confirmations with identical stories. It was very dark, though. However, the thing that gets me is the small flashing light. This was the most distinct abnormality. Nothing in nature or in the dark could have tricked my mind into thinking it was something that it wasn’t. The others didn’t see it, but they were not looking in the direction I was… and I know what I saw.

73,Footsteps.,1294136345,"This is the first story I've ever posted on reddit and I think it belongs in here. It is all true, but it happened when I was much younger so some of the details may be missing.

I grew up in a very small town in the foothills of North Carolina. It was the kind of town that was always a few decades behind the times, but it made for a rather happy upbringing for me. My days were spent throwing rocks into the old Mill Pond down my street, camping out in the back yard, and just walking around downtown causing tolerable trouble with one of my best childhood friends, Graham.

Graham and I would spend a lot of time together during the week, and on the weekends we normally alternated houses for sleep overs. I always loved going to his house because it was big and it had a lot of rooms to play and hide in. Also, his house stood right in the middle of the downtown neighborhood which I loved because I lived a few miles outside of downtown.

Now Graham and I really enjoyed creeping each other out either by telling ghost stories or daring each other to go to the darker recesses of his old house. Nothing creeped me out more than when Grahams mom told us the history of their house. Apparently it used to be a funeral home. Back in the old days, in my small town and others like it, funeral homes were not businesses, but rather community places ran by families out of their homes. The bodies of the deceased would be brought to the home where they were embalmed, dressed, and put on display for the various families. In Grahams 3-story house, the basement was where the bodies were prepped, the 1st floor was were the body (in coffin) was displayed, and the 2nd floor was where the family that ran the funeral home lived. Needless to say, this was unsettling to hear as a child of 9 or 10.

Since its days as a funeral home, Grahams house had not changed much except for the basement, which did not exist anymore because it was filled in. A few weeks after hearing the history of the house, I was sleeping over at Grahams. With our new knowledge, we were really pulling out the stops trying to creep each other out. Graham told me he had heard someone walking up the stairs to his room when everyone was asleep. I told him I could smell flowers in his living room on the first floor in which no flowers were present. We swapped stories well into the night until we both just fell asleep.

It was about 2:45am when I woke up. I was lying in Grahams bed (because we were so young, sharing a bed was not out of the ordinary). I don't remember why I woke up, but I do remember what I heard while I was awake. Footsteps. Little footsteps that creaked the wooden stairs that were right outside of Grahams bedroom. I turned around and woke Graham up to see if he could hear them too. He did and that's when he told me that he wasn't lying earlier that night when he said he had heard footsteps on the stairs. As we sat there in his bed, we heard the footsteps for another few minutes. They moved up and down the stairs as if someone was pacing them. When they stopped, we went to investigate to find that Grahams mom and little sister were both sound asleep. We went back to his room and stayed awake for a little longer, but eventually our eyelids got heavy again and we drifted back to sleep.

It was around 3:30am when I woke up again. This time, my eyes were fixated on something from the side of the bed. A little boy, no older than I was, standing beside the bed looking at me. He was wearing overalls and a white shirt. He had piercing blue eyes (that I will never forget). Everything about him seemed so real except for the fact that I could see Grahams dresser through him.

77,Something on the wall,1294120707,"My friend told me this happened back when we were nine.  Still freaks him right the fuck out, apparently.

He was getting over something, flu or a really bad cold, and had been waking himself up a few times a night with coughing fits for a few nights.  On this night he woke up with a bit of a chill, which wasn't too odd considering he was still a little sick.  He rolled over and that's when he saw it.

Something was standing outside of his second-story window, scrabbling to open it.  It had managed to wedge the window up an inch or two and worked its fingers in, but wasn't able to do much more from the wood swelling from moisture.

He screamed and his father came running, but whatever was outside was able to pull its hand out and get away before his dad came in.  My friend ended up spending the rest of that night in his parents' room.

The worst part was, as he was huddled there on the floor, he could swear he heard footsteps coming from the roof.",nosleep,octagonProfessor,/r/nosleep/comments/evujk/something_on_the_wall/

One I had that was soo soooo scarey I was 21. I went to bed as usual, but I always kept my laptop on so there is some light in my room. I woke up to something.. a demon? holding me up in my bed. I couldn't see his face but I could see the glow from the laptop shining off the features of the side of his face. For some reason this demon was trying to kiss me! I was so scared and could not move. I looked at the wall beside me and there was a hole in the wall with smoke coming out. I looked over at it and I started to pray to god... (im not religious) calling the angles names and what not.. I could feel the demon getting pissed off. He lifted his hand to slap me in the face (his hand was all boney and spidery fingers) and just before his hand hit my face, I snapped out of it and woke up.. I ran and turn the lights on... but I could still feel it's presence in the room. the feeling went away eventually..

81,Tell me how Mommy died.,1294094191,"This isn't my story, just something I picked up along the way:

So I got Netflix a couple of years ago, like everyone, and I stopped going out to the video rental place downtown, they didn't have a very good selection and the prices had kept going up. I'm all for local businesses, but it's just so convenient to get movies in the mail. I was driving by a few months ago and saw that the store was selling it's inventory, hundreds of used movies, the sign said, cheap. Cheap. Cheap. So I decided to stop by on my way home from work, hoping to get a deal. 

The girl at the desk told me that this was their last day open and that most of the movies had been picked over, but I was welcome to look. They were selling all their DVDs for five bucks and all the VHS tapes for just one dollar. I found a few things, the first season of Twin Peaks, and an old copy of Princess Mononoke were the prizes. I also picked up some older movies on tape, some foreign films, movies that hadn't been released on DVD to my knowledge. 

At the bottom of the bin, was a VHS that was in a blank box, it was just black, the tape wasn't marked, and wasn't rewound all the way. Curious, I threw it in and went to check out. The store was almost closed and the girl was eager to see me out the door. 

I got home and watched one of the french movies I picked up, it wasn't until about a week later that I remembered the blank tape. I put it in my old VCR. It was in the middle of some movie, it looked as if it had been filmed on a home video camera. 

There were three people onscreen, an old man, maybe in his sixties, a younger man, who I took to be his son, and a young girl, maybe six or seven. They were all seated at a dinner table, the father and son were eating but the girl didn't even have a plate in front of her, she just sat quietly, looking at the table, while the two men talked, about the weather, traffic, some vague political talk, nothing specific. I fast forwarded and the men talked for several minutes, the girl didn't move, then it cut away to a new scene, it was just the girl this time in front of the camera, looking down, sadly. There was a voice from off screen. 

“Tell me what happened to mommy.” The girl just shook her head. 

“Come on tell me what happened.” She looked up past the camera. The voice of the older man spoke sternly:
“Tell us what happened.” 

The girl waited a moment, and looking down she said, “She died.” 

“That's right, mommy died. How? Huh? Tell me how mommy died.” The voice was calm, like he was asking her what she learned in school that day. The girl looked like she was about to cry, she said something I couldn't understand. “What's that? Come on, how did mommy die? Did she have an accident?” The girl shook her head. 

“No, that's right. Tell me what happened.”

“I killed her...”

“That's right. How'd that happen? Come on how'd you kill mommy?” 

The girl closed her eyes, tears pouring out, and shook her head violently. The older man, came into frame and blocked the view of the girl for a moment, there was a loud clap, and then the man moved offscreen, the girl had a red mark on her cheek. “Tell us how you killed mommy.” 

She was sobbing now and I could barely make out her words. “I-I...m-made her k-k-k-kill herself...” 

“And you can never tell anyone what happened, right? Right?” He was still as calm as ever. The girl nodded. “Tell me why.”

“B-Because they'll t-t-take me away.” 

“Yeah, that's right.  They'll take you away and hurt you.”

“So what do you say if someone asks about mommy?”

“T-That she left.”

“Yeah, that's right!” He sounded almost gleeful. “Hey, it's okay. Alright now, you wanna go to bed?” She nodded slowly, her tears subsiding. “Okay, you go kiss mommy goodnight and you can go to bed.” 
	
The girl looked up at him, with deep fear in her eyes, she said, “No.” 
	
“No? What you don't want to kiss mommy? Go kiss mommy or I'm going to call the police and tell them what you did, and they'll take you away. Do you want that, huh? Do you want them to hurt you?” She shook her head slowly. 

“Okay, go kiss mommy goodnight.” The girl's lips trembled, and she slid out of the chair and walked off screen, you could hear her footsteps leaving the room. The two men talked off camera for a few minutes, then the tape went blank. 

I rewound it to the start, shaken, but I couldn't help myself. The first half of the tape up to the dinner scene was home videos, of a mother and father and two small children, a girl and a boy. I took the tape to the police, and more or less left it in their hands. I've called them a couple of times, the first time they told me that they hadn't found any leads, and the second they weren't able to tell me anything, something about it being an ongoing investigation and confidentiality. 

The footage must have been fifteen years old or more, and I think a lot sometimes about that family, especially the little girl, and what I stumbled onto. The conversation above is taken from my memory, and some notes I took before I gave it to the police. I only watched it once, but a lot of what they said has stuck with me, and apologize if some of this is inaccurate. ",nosleep,mwmani,/r/nosleep/comments/evnht/tell_me_how_mommy_died/

87,"As a kid, I guess I never thought of the skeleton on my dresser as particularly unusual.",1294034178,"It was there as long as I lived in my first house, up until I was seven years old. I would wake up in the middle of the night, hearing the same noise every time: something between a loud heartbeat and a shaking washing machine, throbbing, pulsating, churning rapidly, seemingly coming from both within myself and all around me simultaneously, ingraining itself into my consciousness. I still can conjure up memories of that noise today. 

I could never make the sound go away, and I knew when I heard that noise that I would see its source as soon as I looked toward the dresser. I could try not to look, but I couldn't keep it from looking at me. I could feel its gaze, palpable, boring into my skin, and the only way to make it leave was to confront it. I would turn my head toward the dresser, open my eyes, and see it: a life-sized human skeleton, lying calmly on its side on the dresser, grinning, looking straight at me, taunting me, glowing softly in the pitch blackness of my bedroom.

Sometimes I could blink and make it disappear. These were the easier nights; I would be able to get some sleep because the skeleton would be willing to leave me in peace, the overwhelming noise vanishing just as abruptly as it did. But other nights, no matter how hard I tried to squeeze my eyes closed, I couldn't make it leave. I would close my eyes for long periods - two, three, five minutes - and every time I opened them again, it was still there.

I could never bring myself to stand up and face the thing head-on. As long as the skeleton lay there, no matter how hard I tried to move, I remained fixed. I couldn't scream or make any sort of noise - my vocal chords were paralyzed by the churning sound. The only way out was to remain in silent fear as long as I slept alone in that bedroom. I again closed my eyes tightly, as tightly as I possibly could, trying to tune out the deafening throb, hoping and praying that I would wake up the next day.",nosleep,boshj,/r/nosleep/comments/ev9x1/as_a_kid_i_guess_i_never_thought_of_the_skeleton/
88,Sleeping in the basement. ,1294032942,"How many horror movies/novels/stories have you seen/read/heard that involve a basement? We've heard it all multiple times before: a character goes into a darkened basement...**but they're not alone**. Quite frankly, there's something downright creepy about most basements. I'm sure all of us, on at least one occaison, have sprinted out of a basement as fast as we could after turning out the lights. Most kids would balk at the idea of sleeping in a basement.  

Not me. Not because I was trying to be *super hardcore* or anything like that; rather, it was because my basement isn't all that creepy to begin with. Actually, it's  pretty cool. My parents renovated it when I was 6 or so, so it looks much more like a normal room than the traditional ""creepy basement"". It has everything a budding movie nerd such as myself could ask for: a fairly large TV with ~400 channels, a DVD player, and a sizable stack of DVDs from the weekly library run. Naturally, during last summer, when there was no school to worry about, I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning watching TV and movies and browsing Reddit.  My cat and rabbit kept me company.  

One night, at around 3 AM, while sleepily watching The Daily Show, I suddenly heard a noise from around 30 feet away.  

*crunchcrunchCRUNCHCRUNCHCRUNCH*  

I momentarily froze in panic. Then, I realized it was just the sound of my cat crunching its dry food. Still somewhat shaken, I resumed watching TV. The program cut to a commercial several seconds later, as luck would have it. I picked up the remote to change the channel, only to drop it on the ground. As I bent over to pick it up, I noticed that my cat was on the floor next to the couch. The implications of this observation didn't quite sink in until the sound of cat food being crunch resumed.  

My fight-or-flight response kicked in almost immediately. I ran upstairs to my room, slamming the basement door in the process. Even though no more suspicious sounds were heard for the rest of the night, I could not fall asleep until the sun rose, flooding my room with light.  

I don't sleep in the basement anymore.       ",nosleep,AwkwardSegue,/r/nosleep/comments/ev9m4/sleeping_in_the_basement/

92,A Creepy Start to 2011,1294011895,"I spent New Years Eve with my younger brother and his fiance, eating pizza and watching ""scary"" youtube videos.  For my part, I spent the night trying not to betray my manliness and yelp every time we stumbled on a screamer.  

My brother's fiance is not incredibly difficult to creep out.  On Christmas Eve, at my father's house, I accidentally ended our hunt in the dark for kittens by remarking that if we were in a movie, *this* was when the werewolf would jump out from behind the tree at the corner of the house and eat us. 

On NYE, one of the youtube vids we watched was by a guy whose dog was getting freaked out at night and so he set up a video camera aimed at the door the dog was whining at and let it record one night.  As far as I can remember, the motion sensor lights out on the deck come on a couple times, the blinds on the door go up and down a couple times, and there's some knocking.   The dog does seem to be a little anxious, but I don't remember that he was all that freaked out, so I wasn't all that convinced that the video was real.  

I remarked to my brother's dog, Charlie, that if he saw a ghost, he should actually bark.  My brother's fiance stated that now she'd be freaked out every time he barked.  So I revised my request and told Charlie he should make a specific bark - barky bark bark or something.  

That night my brother's fiance gave me a late Christmas gift - a stuffed Skelenimal, Jack, the rabbit.  (see: 
http://images.entertainmentearth.com/AUTOIMAGES/TN1952lg.jpg)  His face and arms glow in the dark.  I made him sleep under the covers with me on their couch that night.  I half expected to wake up to the dog barking.  Instead, my brother tried to scare me when he went out to smoke, but I enacted my plan for dealing with anything horrifying at night - I pretended not to notice.   

New Year's Day, in the evening, Jack and I returned home.  I sat him on the bed and was checking my email when I heard a *thump*.  I immediately knew the source - my rabbit, Clara. (See: http://i.imgur.com/Dcezh.png)  She thumped again and I went to investigate the problem.  Clara will thump for a couple different reasons - she's instinctively warning of something or she's angry.  If she's angry, she either wants more food, treats or attention.  She had plenty of food and water.  I gave her a quick scritch on the nose and returned to my email, randomly talking to her so she'd feel like she had my attention.  She thumped a couple more times and I got up to 
offer her a treat.  She refused it.  That narrowed it down.  She either wanted out or there was something in her line of sight that seemed dangerous. I laughed to myself, ""oh, ha!  She sees something under the bed!  I bet it's a monster!""

When she continued thumping, I retrieved her from her pen and put her on the bed with me.  She immediately ran to her favorite corner and resumed thumping.  A lot.  I reached over to rub her and she calmed down.  I removed my hand, a couple seconds later, thumping.  Her thumps are surprisingly loud on the carpeted floor of my bedroom, but on the bed they seem thunderous and can be heard throughout the apartment.  I moved her closer to me, hoping I'd be able to continue catching up on stuff I read on the 'net for a while longer.  She ran away.  I moved her back.  She ran away.  Rinse.  Repeat. Maybe I still smell like my brother's dog, I thought.  I moved one of my favorite sweatshirts over for her to sit on, hoping that would help calm her down.  Didn't work.  Maybe Jack smells like the dog, I thought.  I put him down beside the bed.

Everything was fine.  She hated Jack.  I tested the hypothesis a couple times.  Jack on the bed == thump.  Ok.  She really does hate Jack.  I can deal with that.  I put him back on the floor and continued scritching and generally loving on Clara until I was ready to go to sleep.  I returned her to her pen and went into the bathroom to get ready for bed.  

*Thump*
*Thump*

""Cut it out,"" I hollered at her.  

*Thump*
*Thump*
*Thump*
*Thump*

""Oh man,"" I thought, ""know what would make a good story for /r/creepy?  If Jack was back up on the bed.""

I peeked around the doorframe. 

He wasn't.  I offered Clara another treat and this time she took it. I got into bed, picked up Jack and put him under the covers and went to sleep.  

Clara's thumping woke me up twice.  I groggily told her to go back to sleep and searched for Jack under the covers.  Both times I'd managed to knock him off the same side of the bed that her pen was on.  I picked him up, resecured him under the blankets and went back to sleep.

I woke up this morning and it was a bright, bright sunshiney day.  Well, not so sunshiney, but, everything was good.  2010 was a hellish year for me, but my life's headed in a new direction in 2011 and I'm more optimistic about this year than I've ever been about anything before.  

I remembered to put Jack next to the bed and wandered out to the kitchen for breakfast.  Half way through my Cheerios, I could hear Clara start thumping again.  WTF?  

She's thumped more in the last 12 hours probably than she had cumulatively in the rest of her previous life.  She had plenty of food and water.  I scritched her nose and bent down to hand her a treat.  Out of the corner of my eye I caught sight of a faint glow from under the bed.  I bent down and looked under there.  Jack?  Jack was half-way across the carpet under the bed.  THAT'S weird, I thought, but not physically impossible.  Maybe I kicked him under there on my way out to the kitchen.  I'm not the smoothest person when I've just woken up.   

My mom called then to see if I could ride with her to the office and help move some heavy stuff around.  I said sure, tossed Jack on the bed, but threw my sweatshirt on top of him so that Clara wouldn't see him, showered and took off.  

I came home to the biggest WTF moment of my life.  I could hear Clara even before I made it to the bedroom.  I opened the door to find her sitting on my bed, thumping furiously. And Jack, now inhabiting her pen.",nosleep,chmod_me,/r/nosleep/comments/ev4s8/a_creepy_start_to_2011/

95,the noise,1293965572,"I was probably about 4 or 5 years old when this happened.... I was asleep in the first house in which I remember living with my mom after my parents relocated from my birth city (the worst part about sleeping in that house was that the safe haven that was my mother's room was upstairs and I had a room downstairs). Anyways, I remember waking up to a clinging sound that seemed to be resonating from the kitchen. I just tried to ignore it and fall asleep, being the small and scared little boy that I was. Nevertheless, the terrible noise continued, not getting any louder, but still being just as nerve-racking. I looked at my clock, and the time was 2:00 AM on the dot. I thought that was strange, and that I must be dreaming. I tried shaking my head to wake up to no avail (this usually worked for me and still does if I am having a nightmare). I knew I didn't want to see what the noise was, but rather wanted to dart upstairs to my mother as quickly as possible..... unfortunately, there was no way of doing that without passing the hallway to the kitchen. I mustered up some strength and forced myself out of bed and ran as fast as my little legs could carry me through my doorway, across the hall, and up the steps to my mom's room, all the while feeling as though something was right at my heels. I reached the door to her room, which was shut, and began yelling and banging on her door..... there was no answer. I started twisting and pulling the doorknob, but the door was locked and I started to panic. I swear I could've broken down the door even with my tiny little fists, just because of the adrenaline pumping through my veins. However, before I could do any more damage to the door, I felt myself losing my sense of vision and balance... I began to blackout from fear and started falling to the floor. I woke up in my bed in a cold sweat, still just as scared as ever. I felt a sense of relief for a brief moment until I heard a noise and looked at the clock. It read 2:00 AM.

0,Sites like the SCP Foundation?,1293943345,"So I've gone through the SCP Fundation site over the past few weeks.  A lot of the articles are brilliant.  I was thinking about trying my hand at submitting a thought or two, but two things have stopped me.

1. There is already a huge library.  So much so that I've forgotten more than 50% of the SCPs I've read.  This is daunting but not impossible to overcome.

2. The real kicker.  After lurking around the forums and chat room for a few weeks it seems like there has been a push to create a more coherent 'voice' among the articles.  The direction they seem to be taking is towards being more of an encyclopedic straight-up scientific logging of the SCP.  While coherence is a great thing, they're moving away from the parts that I found most alluring: the black humor, the occasional funny O5 memos, the back and forth reports, and the overall 'alive' feel to the world.  I don't think this direction is at all negative in any way, simply not what I am interested in.

With that in mind, are there any places like the Foundation that you guys know about?  I figured advice would be easier to come by here than submitting to something like r/askreddit.

3,"My Haunted Bungalow, part 1 of 2.",1293932932,"When I was in my early 20s I got married to the wrong man. We had been living together and decided to buy a house instead of continuing to pay rent.

I've lived a somewhat haunted life, but didn't really understand the concept of sharing your home and communicating with spirits.

The house was an early 20th century Craftsman Style Bungalow, replete with rich mahogany trim, wainscoting, ceiling beams, fireplace and built-ins with leaded glass. The structure was beautiful and solid and seemed to have a distinct personality of its own.

While we worked to secure financing, we leased the home from the previous owners' nephew. His aunt and uncle's parents had built the home as a wedding present to the couple, and they lived there for their entire marriage. The home was 72 years old when we got it, and the aunt had only passed a few years prior.

I chalked it up to an over-active imagination, but instantly felt a strong sense of being watched (almost supervised) when we first moved in. I felt as though a grandmother-figure was observing and instructing me on a daily basis. I even found myself talking aloud to her and explaining how much I loved the house and wanted to maintain and improve it.

As my wedding approached, I sensed a slight current of matronly disapproval. My fiance and I both worked; yet when 5:00 rolled around, he took to plopping on the couch and expected me to cook dinner and clean up afterward. His mother had catered to his every need, and he assumed that it was my job to pick up where she had left off.

He had always stated that things would be different when we got our own place; but my resentment steadily grew as I realized this was not the case. The first experience happened when I was washing dishes after dinner as he watched TV. From my post at the sink I could see directly through the dining room and into the living room where he sat, slack-jawed, gazing the TV. At that moment someone came up behind me and placed a comforting hand upon my shoulder. As there were only the two of us in the house, this gave me a start. We weren't in the best of neighborhoods, and the idea of someone breaking in wasn't an irrational fear. I jumped around to see no one behind me. The kitchen was quite large, and there was no way for someone to have gotten out of sight in the time it took me to turn around. We were both intrigued by this happening, but didn't think a whole lot of it.

Nothing else happened for a while, and the incident soon faded from my mind. We continued to live our lives and plan the upcoming wedding. Despite his lack of teamwork in the domestic department, we really were great friends; and did lots of things together. I was learning to speak up for myself; and when he got on my nerves by eating my takeout leftovers, I made it clear that this was to stop. He was somewhat inconsiderate, but not a complete jerk. 

Then, one day, we ate out for lunch, and I brought home half a sandwich. I placed the takeout box in the refrigerator and gave him specific instructions not to touch it. He acknowledged this request and everything seemed fine. The next day, he went to work and I unwrapped the leftovers for lunch. I was infuriated to find a huge bite missing from the sandwich. I ate what was left and contemplated whether or not I really wanted to marry such a dishonest man. 

When he got home I told him what I thought about the situation. He was completely dumbstruck and swore that he hadn't touched my sandwich. Although he wasn't a good liar, he did attempt it once in a while. I had grown adept at detecting his lies, and truly believe that he was telling the truth when he said he didn't touch my sandwich. We both became somewhat paranoid as we began to wonder if a homeless person was breaking into our house and raiding the refrigerator. It didn't make sense, though to open the takeout box, unwrap the sandwich, take a bite, wrap it up and leave it there. If you are that hungry, why not just take the whole thing? Mostly, I was disgusted by the idea of having eaten after a stranger. We always kept the doors locked; but I became vigilant about checking and rechecking all doors and windows after that incident.

Strange little things would happen every now and then. I never felt alone, and hated to be in that looming house by myself. Our cat seemed to go insane and began defecating all over the place. But things didn't really get freaky until the wedding drew near.

As I look back, I almost wonder if the old lady knew about the future tragedy that was to be my marriage, and was trying to sabotage it before it could take place.

7,My family is being watched by a ghost dog,1293912398,"It was late summer a few years ago when my wife and I were talking about getting a dog. We had been married a few years but we weren't ready for children yet and we thought a dog might be a nice addition to our little family. The temperature outside our second story apartment was very nice for late August, so we had our windows open let in the soft summer breeze as we sat on the couch and talked. 

Suddenly from outside the window we heard the sound of a dog barking. It was clear as day and sounded as though the animal was right outside our window, which of course was impossible since it was 15 feet off the ground. Thinking maybe a dog had gotten up into the outdoor stair well that connected the apartments, I went outside to check and found nothing. Confused, I searched all around the building and checked the windows across the street to see if maybe some trick of acoustics had carried a dog bark into my window from afar. But there were no dogs near and I knew no one in our building had one. 

After I returned bewildered, we joked about there being a ""ghost dog"" outside our window, hoping to be the dog we adopted. We speculated, just for fun, that he had been unloved in a past life and upon hearing us discuss bringing a dog into our house to love, he was asking to be let in. We stopped joking short of actually inviting him inside, which I think now may have been the best decision I have ever made. 

We eventually did get a dog, a beagle puppy who was full of energy and loved to play. He was an especially great companion for me, since I worked from home and needed an excuse to get outside and see the sun during the day. Despite all his playfulness he did have one peculiar habit: He occasionally paused to stare out the window, the one we had heard the dog bark through, and let out a long, low growl, as if to warn something he found threatening to back away from his house. The first couple of times I chided him, saying he should leave the poor ghost dog alone. Eventually though, I gave up and just chalked it up to a peculiarity of the dog. We all have our quirks, right? 

Fast forward a year and my wife and I have moved into a single family home about 20 miles away from our apartment and got a second dog. I had moved into an office job now and our beagle needed a friend to keep him company during the day. On almost the same night as the first occurrence, I had the windows open and from the back yard we all heard the bark of a dog, just like the first. Both dogs leapt into action and almost smashed into each other going through the doggie door to find out what intruder had invaded their back yard. I grabbed a flashlight and followed, only to find my back yard, my fenced-in back yard with a locked gate, completely empty. There was no dog back there at all. In fact, there weren't even any crickets making noise back there. None of my immediate neighbors have dogs and the nearest dog, four houses down, is a big German Shepherd with a distinct bark, who, I might add, barks his head off if any animals come near any of our houses. The dogs across the street do the same and I know their barks as well. This time I began thinking that Ghost Dog was not a hallucination. 

While the first two occurrences came about a year apart, things have picked up since then. Shortly after our second visit, I began hearing scratching noises on the roof at night. I thought maybe mice in the attic or critters on the roof, but an inspection of the attic revealed no traces of mice and there are no trees near enough my house to let a raccoon or possum get on top of the house. I also began to find dead animals in our back yard; mice, snakes, sometimes birds. At first I chalked it up to our new dog, a rat terrier mix, who had a proclivity for hunting crickets and frogs in the backyard, but after a while I noticed that she stayed well clear of the dead bodies, something dogs like her usually love to at least sniff. She also began to occasionally run into the house scared, leaping into my arms and shivering with fear, but only when she was alone in the yard and only at night. 

However, just this winter I moved from concerned to full on scared about the possibility of a ghost dog. We visited my parents over Christmas and my daughter, another new addition to the family, was napping in an upstairs bedroom. When she woke up I grabbed her from the crib and turned off the baby monitor, but forgot to turn off the receiver in my parents kitchen. After a few minutes of sitting in their living room, my dad suddenly said ""Everyone quiet! ...Do you hear a dog barking?"" 

My heartbeat began to race. We went into the kitchen and found the noise was coming from the receiver. A ghostly static was playing and behind it, the constant barking of a dog. I asked my dad about the neighbors, but he explained that it couldn't be anyone within range of the baby monitor. None of the immediate neighbors had kids and the only family on the block with a dog had taken it with them on their family vacation. This bark was coming from someplace far beyond the normal range of a baby monitor. I turned off the receiver and turned it back on quickly. The barking was gone. 

Unnerved, I explained the entire story of Ghost Dog to my father, hoping he would be the voice of reason and explain everything away as coincidence. Instead, he told us things that made my wife clutch our daughter in fear. As it turns out, right near where I grew up in Southern Maryland, there is a legend of a ghostly dog who guarded the treasure of his master. This is not a lie. It's a true story. You can even read about it here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Tobacco_Village,_Maryland

or do a search on google if you don't believe me. But more terrifying was that a few months before we had come to Maryland for my brother's wedding and stayed at my parent's other house, a little cottage on a inlet of the Chesapeake Bay. The day after we left one of my father's neighbors asked him if he had seen the dog ""on the water"" the night before. My dad thought she meant the neighbors dog had gone swimming, but she explained that she had seen a large spectral dog literally walking ON the water the last night me and my family had been in the house. She told him that their inlet had once been a creek that ran through a cemetery for soldiers killed during the Civil War and that a hurricane had washed the soft ground away, disrupting the men ""at rest"" there and turned the area into an inlet, rather than a creek. She believed that the sacred nature of the ground under the inlet allowed specters to become visible there and asked if our family had any dogs that had died recently. At the time, my dad shrugged it off as crazy talk from the rural locals... but now he wasn't so sure. 

We returned home after Christmas and didn't speak about Ghost Dog at all on our journey home. We had left our real dogs with my in-laws while we were traveling and we got home too late to go get them. So we went to bed with the block still in the doggy door, left there to keep the house from getting too cold while we were gone. A little after 2am that night my wife and I were woken by scratching at the doggy door. I grabbed the baseball bat I keep under the bed and raced into the backyard... but all I found was a dead raven, clearly mauled to death and left in the middle of the yard. I yelled into the night ""YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE"" and then hurried back into the warmth of the house. 

I don't know what to do or if I should even be afraid. Maybe Ghost Dog just wants us to let him in. Maybe he just wants to be loved. But if he mauls animals to death in my yard and terrifies my real dogs, I can't risk him getting near my daughter. I believe he can't get in unless I invite him, but I don't want to be terrorized for the rest of our lives by this apparition. What should I do?

8,The Little People,1293908135,"I'm Irish, so any mention of leprechauns instantly bores me; but reading about people's personal experiences of duendes, little people and such on nosleep has got me thinking...

I used to live with a hacker. He was not Irish, he turned up one day in my town, started hanging out in similar circles, and soon found his way to the spare room in my house. I lived with a load of people in this house, and visitors were always blowing through. He sub-let the room and all was well. He was a really nice guy and never really displayed any signs of mental illness or instability. He kept strange hours because of his work on his computer and didn't leave the house (pretty much ever) but this was his deal and didn't bother anyone else.

While we were living together in the city, I was in the process of buying a house in a rural area in the North West of Ireland. Once the sale had gone through, the house was available to live in, but I still had stuff to wind up in the city, so Mr. Hacker moved to the house in the country. He could work from there, have cheap rent and he could take care of my animals while I wasn't around. Perfect.

However, I went to Spain for a couple of months before moving to this house. I wanted to get the city out of my system and adjust in a neutral place before making my commitment to rural life. I was gone for 3 months, and in total Mr. Hacker lived in the rural house for around 6 months before I moved there. 

When I arrived home we had visitors and I didn't see Hacker, til late one night when I arrived back after being out with the guests. I was smoking a cigarette in the long driveway up to the house with a friend, when Hacker stumbles in off the tiny country road and greets me. He gives me a hug, says welcome home, and it's then I spot the bottle of whiskey in his pocket. He's out of his mind drunk, wandering around the country roads at 2.30 am with no lights or anything. He then took the bottle out and offered it to my friend and I. We drank with him, and he began to tell me about ""the little people"". 

He told me there were little people in the hedgerows at the sides of the road watching him as he walked. They came to him at night and scratched at his door. He saw one looking in his window late one night (his room was on the second floor of the house). He would hear them amid the scratching, saying ""......... leave the house"", ""get out of here"".

At first I got angry, because it was my first night in the house and I thought he was trolling me, but as he spoke, I could hear the sincerity and a sense of desperation in his voice. After all, here he was getting drunk alone and wandering around late at night. I asked what they looked like and he told me they were small, about two feet tall. They had long arms and short stumpy legs, and he said they were ""gnomes"". At this point I started laughing, cos I was imagining David the Gnome stalking my housemate, and it was just about the least scary thing I could imagine. I changed the subject and left it there. 

The following day I spoke to my other housemates about it. They had been there with him for the duration of time that I was in Spain. They said the talk of ""gnomes"" and ""little people"" had been going on for a few months and that his disposition had changed. He was antisocial, non-communicative and surly. Out of the blue one day, about a month after my gnome conversation with him, he said he was leaving. Two days later he was gone. He left at 6am, on foot and never said goodbye. I never heard from him again.

Honestly, at the time I thought he was having a breakdown.

However, during the time I lived in that house, I can't say i ever really felt happy. It was surrounded by forests and when I would go outside to the back of the house, I always felt like there were eyes on me as I moved around. There was something in the attic. We thought it was mice, but it would bump and thump around at night. I had nightmares and sleep paralysis a lot. Two close friends who visited me there often, say they didn't like the place. They found it made them feel heavy and depressed, and it was always freezing cold. A couple came to stay in a yurt on the land surrounding the house, and they soon left. They were having nightmares and felt ""uncomfortable"" in the shadow of the trees. I later found out from a guy who had known the daughter of the previous owners; that they had believed the place to be haunted. He told me that one day the old owner was upstairs in the house working. When she walked downstairs, she found all the doors of the house wide open, although she was the only one home. 

I had never heard of duendes, just as I said before Leprechauns, which to me were a load of rubbish. But as I sit here on nosleep reading, I can't help but wonder if these creatures that my housemate ""saw"" were actually real.",nosleep,witchknot,/r/nosleep/comments/eum39/the_little_people/

The dream starts with my mom,my aunt and me on a little wooden boat going across what looks like a swamp.

After going through the swamp we stop on an island with some scary looking trees;nothing bad is happening so far...right?. Well out of nowhere i see some tiny looking things popping out of the ground,the trees and the water.
I take a closer look just to see that they are dolls,porcelain dolls,plastic dolls,etc .
They start chasing us across the island; i start to panic and scream(i don't know if i actually screamed in real life).Then the dolls catch us and i wake up in sweat and scared the hell out of myself.

We weren't scared, we just thought it was our sister playing tricks on us.. but she was still asleep in her room.

Another time, I was at home and my twin was at school. My mom was in the kitchen cooking some lunch and I was in my room brushing my hair when I heard loud heavy breathing in my right ear! Scared the crap out of me and I ran and told my mom but she said I was just hearing things.

17,"I got pretty much NoSleep last night, so I figured I might as well tell the tale here.  I'm still spooked.",1293744211,"Last night, my girlfriend and I returned home from my parent’s house around 11:30 pm.  It was garbage night, so while she went inside, I began unlocking the side gate to reach the bags and start pulling them down to the curb.  We live next to a small beer distributor, and while I was in the process of unlocking, the owner came out and asked me to help her pull her lighted sign inside.  We took about 3 or 4 minutes to carry it inside (where she thanked me with two awesome Stella goblets!), then we talked outside on the sidewalk for a few more minutes.  Afterwards, I went inside to drop the glasses off before proceeding with the chore outside.  As I walked in, I smelled the distinct smell of cigarette smoke, very similar to what you smell in a seedy bar around 2 am.  I smelled my jacket, thinking I had somehow picked it up in the beer distributor, as neither my girlfriend nor I smoke.  Although I wasn’t sure it was the jacket, I shrugged it off, celebrated my new beer glasses for a moment, then walked out the backdoor.  At this point, both the front and back doors were unlocked.  I yanked a couple bags out of the pile next to the house, and walked down the pathway between the buildings.  The garbage pile contained a metric shit ton of stuff, as we had Christmas packaging, etc, so it probably took me 5-10 minutes to get everything the necessary 20 feet.  Once I had migrated the stack, I locked the gate up from the inside, carried the cans back up to the top of the short incline into the backyard, and walked back in through the back door.  There my girlfriend stood with a frightened look on her face.

“Someone said ‘hey’ to me upstairs.”

I hesitated at first, unsure of how to respond.  I figured if she was absolutely sure she had heard someone, she would have run out of the house and grabbed me.  I said so, and she told me that she had in fact gone out both the front and back doors and yelled for me but that I had not responded for some reason.  I asked her to explain what had happened.

She said “I was putting my boots away in the second bedroom, and someone said ‘heeeey’ in a soft, distinct whisper from across the room.”  Across the room meant the doorway leading up the steps into the attic.  I immediately thought of all the damn stories I had read on here about people living in others attics and coming down for food.  Our attic however, is not a small crawl or storage space; it is a finished, carpeted, Nintendo-containing usable space.  I call it the “hackshack”, as it is mostly a computer cemetery in addition to the space for my desktop and what I suppose I could refer to as an “office space”.  

Well, I figured that even though she may have heard something, perhaps it was an echo from my discussion with the distributor owner, a dog bark, air being pushed out of a creaking heating duct…anything but a person.  But I felt my adrenaline begin to pump as I unsheathed a knife from its wooden casing and headed upstairs.  It grabbed the biggest knife I could find, thinking that its size and the frequent use of its type in movies for murderous rampages would give me the best opportunity if I needed to shank somebody.  My heart started pumping pretty good as I walked through the second bedroom and towards the door.  I opened the initial door into the small anteroom before a door to the stairs.  I looked behind this door and around the small space before opening the next one.  I called up “I have a gun and I’m coming up!”  No response.

I rushed up, figuring, *fuck it, hesitation will only make it worse and there isn’t anything up here anyways but I’m still ready to swing this fucking knife if I need to*.  The stairs are on a steep incline and the room opens to the right, but there is a solid railing between the steps and the room, preventing any vision into the room until the climb has been fully completed.  I flew up and whipped around the corner, only to find, what I had hoped for, a room empty of unwelcome individuals or any signs of them.  We are in the process of completing the setup up there, so there is an overturned couch, some piles of clothes, and a few things stacked against the wall.  I checked behind them all, giving myself a mental ‘whew’ when complete.  Then I saw the small 1.5 foot tall doors leading into the crawlspace in the sloped ceiling.  There are 3 of them, spread around the room.  I had carried my flashlight upstairs as well for some reason, and it would come in handy now.  I went to the first little door, my heart really pumping now, and pulled it open.  The circle of light from the flashlight was swept around the small area, illuminating the damn knob and tube wiring I need to replace and the wood walking planks over the insulation.  Nothing else.  I tried the second with the same results.  Next was the final crawlspace, the largest one, waiting for me on the other side of the room.  I crossed over and noticed the latch was not fully closed, just like someone had crawled in and not been able to turn it from the inside to relatch it.  Fuck.  I fiddled with it for a second then yanked it open, thrusting the knife and flashlight in before my head.  I whipped the light around the space, rapidly exposing all of the hidden corners and hiding spots.  Again, nothing but cobwebs and wood.  I pulled my head out and took a deep breath.  I followed this up by running downstairs and throughout the remaining rooms of the entire house, pulling open closets and bathrooms, being sure no one could possibly change rooms or hiding spots while I was moving ahead.  The house was empty, save for its standard inhabitants.

I dropped the knife on the mantle over our bedroom fireplace and we crawled into bed.  My girlfriend had seemingly written this off as ghostly activity, not too unreasonable in our 130 year old house, and after some talk, had started drifting off to sleep.  I stared at the ceiling for awhile, trying to figure out a plausible explanation when I thought of some things that made it worse.

We have a basement in our house, but you need to go outside to get to it.  You open a large wooden shutter door and descend some steep steps to reach it.  I have a Master lock for it, but rarely actually use it, and it hasn’t been on the door for at least the last month.  I had been down there for 45 minutes or so yesterday while leaving the regular backdoor open and the house empty (girlfriend was out).  I had heard noises above me, but the house is old so that wasn’t atypical, and I had disregarded them.  Next, I had smelled smoke when I had walked in last night, but it hadn’t been direct like someone was smoking in the room, but more of that lingering stank smell.  Kind of like I would expect if someone had been smoking in the basement below that room, as they were only separated by a plank of wood.  Finally, when my girlfriend had heard the voice call out to her, she was next to a heating duct.  Because my house is relatively small, sounds and voices carry well through the ducts, and I thought, could perceivably carry two floors.  It all made sense.  There were multiple people in the basement.  They had smoked cigarettes, hung out, probably drank my fermented homebrew out of the carboy like assholes, and one had called out to the other when they heard us upstairs.

After thinking about it, I actually felt a little better, as there were people here but they weren’t able to access the main living space.  It all lined up so I woke up my girlfriend and presented my findings to her, but she immediately destroyed the theory, saying the voice *definitely* came from her right, not her left, where the duct was located.  I tried to convince her she was alone and not expecting a voice, but she insisted, even saying the voice sounded just like mine, except it was only a few feet away.  We went back and forth on that idea and a few others, but she would not relent.  The voice was not from people downstairs, it was not an echo from me talking outside, it was not the dog barking or the neighbors yelling.  It was someone, or something, in the room.

I stayed up for a long time alternating between reading and thinking about the whole incident while avoiding sleep, finally allowing myself to drift off around 5 am.  I awoke around 9 am and my girlfriend and I talked about how it all seemed so silly in the daylight.  We decided to go get up for the day and go grocery shopping.  She went to open the closed door the second bedroom to get her shoes when she heard a **THUMP** from behind the door and sprinted back into our room. Suddenly it wasn’t so silly, even in the daylight.  I whipped the door open.  Again, nothing.  What the fuck.  We turned and went back into our bedroom, trying to not get worked in a dither again.  It was nothing, just an old house.  That’s when I saw it.  Slightly subtle but simultaneously horrifying.  It was the gleam of sunlight bouncing off of the knife blade that was no longer sitting safely on the fireplace mantle where I had left it, but was instead now sitting on my nightstand, a mere foot from where I had laid my head last night.

20,Creepy VHS cassette tape found in mothers storage box.,1293718235,"This event that occurred is 100% completely true, I'm not here to share a BS fairy tale, and this subreddit seems to be the only one I can find to share this experience.

Eleven years ago ( I was around 7), I was helping my mother clean out the storage room where we kept all unused items in boxes. We used to own a very old stereo system that played old VHS cassette tapes, (I'm sure your parents and grandparents owned one). When I finished cleaning out the storage room, I found a box filled with old cassette tapes my mother listens to. My mom walked back in the room and found the tapes, in joy she took a handful of the tapes and played it on the stereo system. Yet there was this one tape...this one distinct tape that caught my eye. All other tapes had plastic covers on, except this one. All other tapes were named ""Indian Bollywood classics"", songs named from movies and other artists. This tape however, is blank, the color was pitch black and seemed lighter than the other ones. My mom put in a whole bunch of tapes in the stereo, listening to old indian tunes while she did the laundry. When most of the tapes finished, I decided to pop this black one in. My mom was in the other room doing the laundry, I stood on top of the chair to reach a table in the kitchen where the stereo system was placed. For the first minute, the tape played nothing..you could hear light screeches and scratches but that was it. Thinking it was broken, I left the kitchen to do something else. I listened attentively but nothing occurred. As I was about to take out the tape, my mom called my name to put away clothes, a couple of minutes later, a song started playing. The song was like any other, old traditional exotic indian beats with a male and female singing melodiously on cue. Nothing seemed strange, however the song played for nearly 10 minutes while the average song on the tape was 4 to 5. What turned to 10 minutes turned 16 as I kept looking at the clock. the same melody was playing over and over again, nothing seemed to change. 16 minutes went to 24, and while I was occupied with other things, my mom and I never seemed to notice the song or the time much. 

I asked her in Hindi, ""Mami, why does the song keep playing over and over again"", ""I don't know son, here put these away"". My mom seemed too occupied with her own chores to notice any difference. 30 minutes into the song, I thought I was going to go insane, it was driving me nuts, yet for some reason, I was too fearful to enter the empty lifeless kitchen where the song was playing, something about the atmosphere just did not seem right. I could feel something dark, but just couldn't explain the feeling. Suddenly the tape stopped, light screeches and scratches started playing again, but you had to listen up close to actually hear it. I was about 10 feet away in the corridor from the kitchen staring at the stereo as I listened attentively again. Since putting in the tape the whole event occurred for about 40 minutes. 

Suddenly, the scratches turned into a voice, a very scratchy and out of tune voice. Multiple voices started penetrating and interacting with one another, it was impossible to understand any of it. The voices just kept yelling and screaming. 

""BRAARAWWWRAWWBRAHHHRAWWWBRAAARAAHHHHHHHRAARAAARAHHRAAAAHRAWWW"". That was the best I could explain the sound, it literally pierced your ear, penetrating through the sound holes of the stereo system, I was too frightened to turn it off, I ran to my mother crying whom still did not seem to notice any sounds. When she turned it off, her response to the tape: ""Well it must be broken, don't be scared, its nothing"". Still weeping, my mother placed the tape on the table, as I kept staring at it, I decided to look inside the tape....It was completely empty, there was no black tape inside the cassette tape, how could music play without the black tape inside it?...impossible, I thought. The tape was just a plastic hollow rectangular device.Days went by when my mom used the stereo system again, however this time, every tape we played came out broken, the black tape inside the cassette tape would come out drooping down like fallen spaghetti. The stereo itself would not work. We threw away the stereo, but that black unnamed cassette tape......, to this day I do not know where we placed it, maybe it is still lying somewhere on the floor in our old apartment, hoping no one discovers it, or it could still be lying inside a box we took to our new home, the same box where I first found the tape. To this day I still stare at that box with the tapes inside, hoping that black tape is not in there, yet my curiosity still wants that tape to be inside that box, much to my sanity, that I could listen to it..over and over again.

21,The Doctor,1293696167,"I've heard him called the Doctor, The Bird-man, sometimes the Plague, and I hear he also goes by Dr. Death, but that sounds a little over dramatic. He wears a black robe, and a bird mask. With a long beak, the kind the “plague doctors” used to wear. He likes to kill, maim, torture. But that's not what he loves. He loves the hunt. When you see him, and you will, he marks you somehow. He gets your scent, some say, but again that's pretty melodramatic. From then on he makes every attempt to ruin you. 

He used to be seen as simply a bad omen, most likely in association with the disease. But recently more direct connections have been made. After you discover him, and he's onto you, he'll seem to follow you. You'll see him out of the corner of your eye, deep in the reflections of mirrors. Then, soon after, he begins his work. There's no specific set of action for him, it's different every time but he's been known to cause accidents, appearing in front of your car, in the middle of the road at night. He's been seen over the beds of infants while they sleep, looking down, through his mask. Within a few days the child is dead. He can lead you astray, into danger, chasing you into dark alleys to be beaten and raped in the case of a young woman from New York. 

To some he comes directly, knocking on your door late at night, or wandering around the dark corners of your home, you might wake up without a finger, or with cuts all over your body. You see him everywhere, he haunts you and those you love until you think it will drive you mad, and then...it stops. Relieved you settle back into routine, maybe see a psychologist, who I'm sure will tell you very comforting things. This calm period lasts for different lengths of time, usually no shorter than a year, but once as long as six years. Then the nightmares begin. At first he will simply appear in the backdrop of your dreams, looking up at you as you fly, sitting in the pews of your dream wedding. Soon he is all you dream about. 

The nightmares usually consist of elaborate and lengthy sessions of torture, with instruments either ancient or unknown, and the pain is immense. You'll find yourself sleeping longer, despite the terrors, nodding off while in class or at work, it becomes harder to wake you up, you'll be slipping into his world. And he begins to slip into yours once more, stalking you while you're awake. Victims report waking from the nightmares to find themselves strapped to their beds or sometimes to a tree in a nearby forest, with the Doctor peering down at them, instruments of torture in hand to begin the pain anew. And after a time you won't know what is real and what is not, all you will know is the pain. After that, it's anyone's guess. Many victims who report or record being hunted, commit suicide when the nightmares begin, well at least they are found dead, seemingly by their own hand. Others disappear, as if they simply fell through the cracks. And some, of course, are found, brutally murdered.

However it ends, it always starts the same way, with you finding him. And now, after reading this, you won't be able to help seeing or hearing about him. On the edge of your vision, in old movies and pictures, anywhere. Maybe talk of “Plague Doctors” will come up in one of your classes, or in a casual conversation, or you'll see a beak mask in the window of that corner shop, he could be...anywhere.

26,Just to think what would've happened if I stepped outside the car...,1293673264,"I was driving a shortcut from Twentynine Palms, CA to Albuquerque, NM. Twentynine Palms is located in the desolate high desert east of LA. The shortcut was all two lane road through total nothingness, except for passing through Amboy, CA. Amboy is a nearly abandoned town nearly as far below sea level as Death Valley, with a dormant volcano and lava field on one side and a salt flat on the other. It was also, at the time, a hotspot for satanic group activity.

So I was driving by myself in the afternoon. I stopped in Amboy and snapped a picture of the city sign, just to prove I was there to friends who dared me to take that route to I-40. I got back in my car and proceeded to drive up into the mountain range between Amboy and I-40.

Once I reach the top I am driving north through a canyon with high grass on both sides of the road. Up ahead I see some stuff in the middle of the road. As I approach I slow down to see a red Pontiac Fiero stopped sideways across both lanes, a suitcase open with clothes scattered everywhere and two bodies laying face down in the road, a man and a woman.

I stop a hundred feet or so away and the hair on the back of my neck is standing up. Being a Marine, I reach under the seat and pull out a 9mm pistol and chamber a round. Something seemed very wrong, it looked too perfect as if it were staged. An ambush? Was I being paranoid? Something was just wrong. Getting out of the car seemed unthinkable, it was the horror movie move.

As I scanned the road I saw a line I could drive. Pass the guy in the road on his left, swerve to the right side of the woman, behind the Fiero and I'd be on the other side. I dropped it into first gear, punched it and drove the line I planned.

I passed the back of the Fierro without hitting it or either of the bodies in the road. I continued forward a couple hundred feet and slowed down so I could breathe and let my heart slow down. As I looked up into the rearview mirror I saw that the two bodies had gotten up to their knees and twenty or so people emerged from the tall grass on either side of the road by the car and bodies.

At that moment my right foot smashed the gas pedal to the floor and did not let up until I had to slowdown for the I-40 east onramp.
I will never know what would have happened to me had I gotten out of the car to check on the bodies or stopped my car closer to them. 
Somehow I do not think it would have been good.

46,"My house is haunted, or worse.",1293379056,"I bought my house about a year ago. The neighborhood is quiet, and my neighbors get up early like I do to head off to work. The house is a bi-level with an attic accessable from the garage and one of the upstairs bedrooms. 

I had roommates living with me until about three months ago, so I never really felt unsafe in my house. My area of the house is the lower level, split between my bedroom and my man-cave.

So here is what has been going on:

The first occurance that something was wrong was when I had a friend come over to pick up a computer I sold to him. I had taken a shower prior to him coming over. I gave him a tour of my house when he arrived and he noticed hand prints on my shower glass. He said ""Niiiice man"" in reference to me showering with someone. I played along by giving two thumbs up, but I knew I had never showered with anyone in that shower, nor have I ever placed my hands on the glass. 

Another occurance happened when I went on vacation to NY and had my mom house-sit for me. When I got back home, she said my house was freaky and that she had heard footsteps in the room above mine (the bedroom with access to the attic). I've heard the same footsteps since then, but my dog doesn't react to them at all. They seriously leave me paralyzed with fear.

Since most of my time is spent downstairs playing games or on reddit, I only go upstairs for food or to let the dog outside. I took a break one time to get a snack and upon entering the kitchen, I could not help but notice my pantry door wide open, with some of my food missing. 

If I leave for an extended period of time (work) my stuff is always either moved slightly, or placed in drawers.

I've thought about investigating the attic, but I can't bring myself to do it.

47,Ghost Grandma?,1293378245,"I've been browsing /nosleep for a while and it reminded me of a few encounters that I had about 3 years ago.

It was 2007, and my mom just got engaged to a man, and she moved in with him. When I would visit she told me that sometimes they heard things moving around in the upstairs (empty) apartment. My mom also told me that her fiance's mother died upstairs and they thought it was her making noises. A few months passed and I actually moved into the upstairs apartment. I never heard any noises or anything weird, and  I wasn't even scared to be up there: it was no big deal to me. Sometimes I would be on the computer or watching TV and my mom would come up and ask why I was moving things around so much. She would always ask me during a time I was not doing anything at all which was weird. A few months passed and I was downstairs hanging out with mom. It was really late and I decided to go upstairs and sleep. It was pitch black, and I walked up the stairs. Once I get to the top of the stairs I have to walk into the middle off the hallway and pull on a light switch to give me light. I was in the dark feeling around for the light and I touched something. It felt like I had touched a person. It was warm and soft. I finally found the light switch and looked around for something I could have possibly bumped into. There was nothing. It was blank hallway. Nothing to accidentally touch and mistake for a person. It was very creepy and I got such a bad feeling in my stomach. I ran downstairs to tell my mom and she was freaked out too. Nothing happened after that, but I will always remember it.",nosleep,MyPinkElephants,/r/nosleep/comments/ernfp/ghost_grandma/

49,Mr. Widemouth,1293157627,"During my childhood my family was like a drop of water in a vast river, never remaining in one location for long. We settled in Rhode Island when I was eight, and there we remained until I went to college in Colorado Springs. Most of my memories are rooted in Rhode Island, but there are fragments in the attic of my brain which belong to the various homes we had lived in when I was much younger.

Most of these memories are unclear and pointless– chasing after another boy in the back yard of a house in North Carolina, trying to build a raft to float on the creek behind the apartment we rented in Pennsylvania, and so on. But there is one set of memories which remains as clear as glass, as though they were just made yesterday. I often wonder whether these memories are simply lucid dreams produced by the long sickness I experienced that Spring, but in my heart, I know they are real.

We were living in a house just outside the bustling metropolis of New Vineyard, Maine, population 643. It was a large structure, especially for a family of three. There were a number of rooms that I didn’t see in the five months we resided there. In some ways it was a waste of space, but it was the only house on the market at the time, at least within an hour’s commute to my father’s place of work.

The day after my fifth birthday (attended by my parents alone), I came down with a fever. The doctor said I had mononucleosis, which meant no rough play and more fever for at least another three weeks. It was horrible timing to be bed-ridden– we were in the process of packing our things to move to Pennsylvania, and most of my things were already packed away in boxes, leaving my room barren. My mother brought me ginger ale and books several times a day, and these served the function of being my primary from of entertainment for the next few weeks. Boredom always loomed just around the corner, waiting to rear its ugly head and compound my misery.

I don’t exactly recall how I met Mr. Widemouth. I think it was about a week after I was diagnosed with mono. My first memory of the small creature was asking him if he had a name. He told me to call him Mr. Widemouth, because his mouth was large. In fact, everything about him was large in comparison to his body– his head, his eyes, his crooked ears– but his mouth was by far the largest.

“You look kind of like a Furby,” I said as he flipped through one of my books.

Mr. Widemouth stopped and gave me a puzzled look. “Furby? What’s a Furby?” he asked.

I shrugged. “You know… the toy. The little robot with the big ears. You can pet and feed them, almost like a real pet.”

“Oh.” Mr. Widemouth resumed his activity. “You don’t need one of those. They aren’t the same as having a real friend.”

I remember Mr. Widemouth disappearing every time my mother stopped by to check in on me. “I lay under your bed,” he later explained. “I don’t want your parents to see me because I’m afraid they won’t let us play anymore.”

We didn’t do much during those first few days. Mr. Widemouth just looked at my books, fascinated by the stories and pictures they contained. The third or fourth morning after I met him, he greeted me with a large smile on his face. “I have a new game we can play,” he said. “We have to wait until after your mother comes to check on you, because she can’t see us play it. It’s a secret game.”

After my mother delivered more books and soda at the usual time, Mr. Widemouth slipped out from under the bed and tugged my hand. “We have to go the the room at the end of this hallway,” he said. I objected at first, as my parents had forbidden me to leave my bed without their permission, but Mr. Widemouth persisted until I gave in.

The room in question had no furniture or wallpaper. Its only distinguishing feature was a window opposite the doorway. Mr. Widemouth darted across the room and gave the window a firm push, flinging it open. He then beckoned me to look out at the ground below.

We were on the second story of the house, but it was on a hill, and from this angle the drop was farther than two stories due to the incline. “I like to play pretend up here,” Mr. Widemouth explained. “I pretend that there is a big, soft trampoline below this window, and I jump. If you pretend hard enough you bounce back up like a feather. I want you to try.”

I was a five-year-old with a fever, so only a hint of skepticism darted through my thoughts as I looked down and considered the possibility. “It’s a long drop,” I said.

“But that’s all a part of the fun. It wouldn’t be fun if it was only a short drop. If it were that way you may as well just bounce on a real trampoline.”

I toyed with the idea, picturing myself falling through thin air only to bounce back to the window on something unseen by human eyes. But the realist in me prevailed. “Maybe some other time,” I said. “I don’t know if I have enough imagination. I could get hurt.”

Mr. Widemouth’s face contorted into a snarl, but only for a moment. Anger gave way to disappointment. “If you say so,” he said. He spent the rest of the day under my bed, quiet as a mouse.

The following morning Mr. Widemouth arrived holding a small box. “I want to teach you how to juggle,” he said. “Here are some things you can use to practice, before I start giving you lessons.”

I looked in the box. It was full of knives. “My parents will kill me!” I shouted, horrified that Mr. Widemouth had brought knives into my room– objects that my parents would never allow me to touch. “I’ll be spanked and grounded for a year!”

Mr. Widemouth frowned. “It’s fun to juggle with these. I want you to try it.”

I pushed the box away. “I can’t. I’ll get in trouble. Knives aren’t safe to just throw in the air.”

Mr. Widemouth’s frown deepend into a scowl. He took the box of knives and slid under my bed, remaining there the rest of the day. I began to wonder how often he was under me.

I started having trouble sleeping after that. Mr. Widemouth often woke me up at night, saying he put a real trampoline under the window, a big one, one that I couldn’t see in the dark. I always declined and tried to go back to sleep, but Mr. Widemouth persisted. Sometimes he stayed by my side until early in the morning, encouraging me to jump.

He wasn’t so fun to play with anymore.

My mother came to me one morning and told me I had her permission to walk around outside. She thought the fresh air would be good for me, especially after being confined to my room for so long. Exstatic, I put on my sneakers and trotted out to the back porch, yearning for the feeling of sun on my face.

Mr. Widemouth was waiting for me. “I have something I want you to see,” he said. I must have given him a weird look, because he then said, “It’s safe, I promise.”

I followed him to the beginning of a deer trail which ran through the woods behind the house. “This is an important path,” he explained. “I’ve had a lot of friends about your age. When they were ready, I took them down this path, to a special place. You aren’t ready yet, but one day, I hope to take you there.”

I returned to the house, wondering what kind of place lay beyond that trail.

Two weeks after I met Mr. Widemouth, the last load of our things had been packed into a moving truck. I would be in the cab of that truck, sitting next to my father for the long drive to Pennsylvania. I considered telling Mr. Widemouth that I would be leaving, but even at five years old, I was beginning to suspect that perhaps the creature’s intentions were not to my benefit, despite what he said otherwise. For this reason, I decided to keep my departure a secret.

My father and I were in the truck at 4 a.m. He was hoping to make it to Pennyslvania by lunch time tomorrow with the help of an endless supply of coffee and a six-pack of energy drinks. He seemed more like a man who was about to run a marathon rather than one who was about to spend two days sitting still.

“Early enough for you?” he asked.

I nodded and placed my head against the window, hoping for some sleep before the sun came up. I felt my father’s hand on my shoulder. “This is the last move, son, I promise. I know it’s hard for you, as sick as you’ve been. Once daddy gets promoted we can settle down and you can make friends.”

I opened my eyes as we backed out of the driveway. I saw Mr. Widemouth’s silouhette in my bedroom window. He stood motionless until the truck was about to turn onto the main road. He gave a pitiful little wave good-bye, steak knife in hand. I didn’t wave back.

Years later, I returned to New Vineyard. The piece of land our house stood upon was empty except for the foundation, as the house burned down a few years after my family left. Out of curiosity, I followed the deer trail that Mr. Widemouth had shown me. Part of me expected him to jump out from behind a tree and scare the living bejeesus out of me, but I felt that Mr. Widemouth was gone, somehow tied to the house that no longer existed.

The trail ended at the New Vineyard Memorial Cemetery.

I noticed that many of the tombstones belonged to children.

50,The house by the river - Photos,1293156227,"From this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/epis1/the_house_by_the_river/  
  
My Mom had a drinking glass in her room one night, on her dresser, she forgot about it and it had a little bit of milk left in it. In the middle of the night she heard a pop sound, then a clank, so she turned on her light and looked around, her eyes focused on the drinking glass and she noticed that there was something dripping from the dresser, she got up and noticed that the glass was cut perfectly in half, one half had fell to the floor and the other half was still standing on the dresser. It happened another time, too, and if I recall correctly, she kept the glasses. My Mom texted me these photos after she found them and told me the story about the second time it happened. While she was drinking water from this glass it started to feel odd, like the glass was getting soggy, so she examined it and it was actually melting right down the middle, but still intact. You can see the warping in that photo and I can edit this thread later when I take more photos on Christmas.

Eyeballing the “out of service” sign, I sighed, at having to take the stairs. Four flights up and out of breath; opening door to an office I am greeted by a woman in white handing me a glass of water.
“Not quite the athlete are you?” she says sarcastically. “Come in and have a seat, I’ll let the doctor know you’re here”.
I watch her leave the room. “Cute, I think to myself, but the red lipstick was too much” Wiping the sweat from my forehead, I sit down and drink 
Sipping my water. It’s bitter, but cold , room temperature, refreshing nonetheless. Studying my surroundings, I’m sitting in a normal psychiatrist office, magazines litter the coffee table and just as I was about to grab “Dream Analysis” the receptionist calls, “The doctor is ready for you”. She escorts me into his office and I sit down. The doctor closes the door behind me,  surprising me, I hear it click and then lock.
The “get-to-know-you” process starts; same old questions, 
“tell me what you don’t like about yourself?” “Tell me…what do you think is wrong with YOUR life?” Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until he said, faintly, “I can take you away from this reality you live in” My eyes scanned the room, I just heard him say that right? I’ve heard voices before, but…I was sure he said that out loud. 
Recap: I was sitting at my 5th psychiatrist appointment. I had already gone through 4 that I couldn’t stand, doctors giving me the same advice “get some exercise, take these pills”. I was bitter, only because I was convinced these people didn’t care about my problems, they were just pretending to care so they could get paid without spending a lot of time “talking”. A corrupt system, yet I had nowhere else to go.
I found Dr. Connors through his online ad. One late night, I randomly typed into the search box “doctors who actually give a fuck” and pressed enter.
He had the only ad when the results appeared.
“Yes, I give an F…
“Problems exist because of YOU! 
“Certified Neurological Dr. – FREE Appts. Limited”
It caught my eye because of the “FREE”. I figured why not? What do I have to lose? It’s free for Christ sake! 
He did say “…take me away from reality” right?
Wondering to myself “what have I gotten myself into…?” 
Anyways, I brushed aside his comment and asked him about his online ad,
“So,” I say. “Problems exist because of YOU!”
“Yes, that is correct” he says.
“…then why do I feel like I just wasted an hour of my life?” I say sharply.
Responded sternly, he says
“Would you rather have that hour back so you can dwell on how pathetic you think your life is?”
I wasn’t expecting him to say that, usually psychiatrists diplomatic.
Pleasantly surprised by his bluntness, I looked at him waiting for him to speak more. “June.” he says.
“I am conducting an experiment, and I need a participant. We are both looking for something that we have yet to find, that’s why I choose you or perhaps you choose me, subconsciously,”
I leaned forward, my eyes fixated on his. My heart pounded faster, I wiped my drenched hands on my pants.
“What’s the catch?” I ask.
“No catch, if you don’t want to participate that’s fine, we’ll just continue and pretend I never asked, but I’m telling you, you won’t regret it. 
I’ll give you five minutes…”
He gets up, walks over to a bookshelf and places a small timer on the desk; he sets it to five minutes and walks out the door.
4:59…4:58…
I had spent the past 5 years of my life trying to leave my world, my reality so to speak by using substances like alcohol, marijuana and amphetamines, nothing worked. I hated my job; I was alone in this city, broken hearted and hurting. I was a lost soul, looking to heal, to move on, a way to forget the past, to forget her. 
4 minutes.
Looking out the window at the city, I sit pensively. Cigarettes and coffee sounded nice.
3 minutes.
A toilet flushes in the other room. A bead of sweat rolls into my eyes, it stings.
2 minutes.
Dr. Connors steps out, goes over to a refrigerator and pours a glass of orange juice, places the glass on the desk and sits down and eyeballs me. I stare back at him waiting for him to say something. He looks at the timer,
1 minute.
Empty beer bottles, old pipes and memories, my last thoughts.
“…Tell me more”.
My head starts to hurt and my vision becomes blurry, panicking I grab the arm of the chair for balance and slowly watch the desk turn sideways; I never see the timer hit zero. Going in and out of consciousness I hear voices, Dr. Connors, the receptionist, but can’t make out any words.
And then it goes black…
I wake up.
I don’t know where I am, its cold and the hairs on my arms rise, I shudder. Water drips off in the distance sounding like a leaky faucet, I cant see anything, it smells wet, like rain fall. I hear flapping off in the distance… bats maybe? A light catches my eye, its dim, twinkling off in the distance. I get up off the cold rocky floor and walk until the light becomes brighter. I trip and my balance gives way, crashing down, I fall onto sharp rocks, and in pain grabbing my leg in discomfort; I sit and wait for my eyes to adjust to the darkness.
I cant remember what/where I was doing before; my clothes give no clues, they look normal, white tee and jeans. Standing up in pain, I cautiously walk towards the light down the rocky hall and watch as the mouth widens and my heart pounds as I see what lies before me. The ground has come to an end and carefully I look down and up and take a step back, I throw up. 
Controlling myself I run my hand on the wall looking for a smooth area and bump into a hook cemented firmly in the wall. I move my foot and hit something bending down, I look at it, its rope. Understanding my surroundings I realize I’m in a cave perched high on a mountainside miles from the ground. The moon, the only source of light, dimmed across a valley of fog-hidden trees swimming for miles and miles. I take a step back from the ledge and my head starts to hurt, like a piercing migraine; running my hands against the cave-like wall, I sit down and close my eyes.
I wake up.
I see Dr. Connors standing over me, his big head taking up my vision.
“That was just the beginning…” he says with a smirk on this face.
I pass out again.
Opening my eyes I see someone staring back at me. Looking to my right, left, up and down, eyes follow my every movement. I’m sitting Indian style and have awoken in a room of mirrors, everywhere. I get up, he gets up too. I try to remember what I was doing before… but… I cant. I start to feel claustrophobic and look for a way out, I run my hands along the glass walls looking for an escape, he follows me everywhere. I look for something, anything to use to break the glass, I see nothing. “Stop looking at me!” I scream.
I need to get out, throwing myself against the mirror wall, nothing breaks. I start pounding, punching with my fists as hard as I can and hear a crack. My hand breaks.“AGHHHHH!!!” I scream in rage. “What this is!?!?” I yell.
He screams back at me. “Get me out of here!”
I can’t take it anymore, screaming, pounding and crying in pain, I feel sick, nauseous, I look at him and he looks back at me with bloodshot eyes, tears stream down his cheeks. I turn around and run until I see myself getting bigger and bigger and SLAM full speed into the other side, falling backwards I pass out.I wake up. I’m lying on a couch., the Dr. Connors office. Looking at the clock, it reads 9:32 a.m., I sit upright; a glass of water is next to me, I sip it slowly. Confused I stand up and stumble towards door. It opens and Dr. Connors steps in. “Have a seat June” he says.
Motioning towards the chair in front of his desk, I sit down as he tells me,
“Don’t worry, this is real you’re back, do you know what just happened?”
Stumbling for words, “I remember coming to your office…oh…the ad…online…my head throbbing.
“Of course, anything else?”
I think, hard. Miles off the ground, a valley of trees littered my view and bloodshot eyes. I forget as soon as I remember it.
“June, today when you came in I had my colleague drug you”,
I remembered the bitter water.
“ I have been working on a new drug. I apologize for not telling you ahead time and was ready if you had said no, remember the orange juice? It’s a citric acid, it would have negated the effects of the drug”
I didn’t say anything.
He continued, “What you experienced today only you will know, although I wish you could have remembered more…a chemical flaw on my part” 
“You see, as people we are always looking to blame others for our problems, your car breaks down, it’s the mechanics fault, your late to a meeting, too much traffic, what you experienced today was that in reality its what’s inside” - he points to his head, is really where the problem lies. June, if you can conquer your fears in your mind then you can conquer anything…What I’m trying to do is help people who cannot conquer their fears in the real world, but maybe they can conquer them in the dream world. I hope wherever you were you got see what your problems or fears are but, more importantly what you’re afraid of.
I remembered the mirrors. I didn’t know what to say. “I’d like you to come back for another trial”
Feeling like I had no other choice I agreed.
“Same time next week” and showed me the door. And as quickly as it had come, it was over and done with.
I felt confused walking out.
“Is he going to be ok doctor? The receptionist asked.
“The dosage was too small, he didn’t get the full experience, but it’s a step, I just hope he learned something from it”
“Prep for the 10am, ill use a higher dosage”
“Yes doctor.”
The receptionist goes over to her desk, adjusts herself and pours a glass of water and waits. The door opens; a man stumbles in, panting,
“Not quite the athlete are you?” she says handing him the glass.

56,God's Mouth,1293071899,"I huffed and puffed under my breath as I stared into God’s Mouth. I felt like the Big Bad Wolf ready to interrupt the innocent little pigs as they hurriedly fortified their makeshift homes. I grinned at this thought and then turned my head to look for Margaret. She was a couple of feet down the hill from the entrance of the cave, holding a walking stick close to her petite breasts. “Hurry up!” I called down to her. I turned back to the cave, still grinning. An old, rotted sign outside read ‘God’s Mouth Cave: Keep Out!’ What a tired cliché.

Margaret finally made it to the entrance and stood beside me, almost doubled over and out of breath. I looked down and smiled. “Check it out!” I laughed. “God’s mouth. Wonder where Jesus’ anus is?” I chuckled to myself. Margaret was less amused.

“Give me the damn water bottle,” she said, exasperated. The open bottle met her lips, and for a moment I felt peaceful in a way, watching her drink the water. Actually I take that back. The ‘peaceful’ comment, I mean. It was more of a feeling that was sort of hard to put my finger on or give a name, but I could settle for a nice ‘content’. Content seemed to be one of those words that manifest itself when natural, human words seemed to fail. Again, an utter cliché, but it felt good to feel a strange, mixed-up sort of happy for once.

I sighed and turned my flashlight on. I pointed it into the cave. Black. God’s Mouth. This seemed like the antithesis of a Holy Spirit. I turned again to Margaret. “You ready?” I asked. She was finally standing straight up. She nodded. I clapped a friendly hand to her back and we walked into God’s Mouth.

The inside was not unlike the preview I had glimpsed outside with my flashlight. Dark, dismal, and endlessly black. It seemed to stretch endlessly, no matter how I positioned my flashlight. The rocky terrain was damp and imposing. The last natural light slowly disappeared behind Margaret and I as we made our way deeper and deeper. I found it strange how soft and compelling the world around me now appeared, despite the stalactites, stalagmites, and other various rocky formations being so jagged. It seemed that even amongst the pointed teeth of God I could lay down and rest there forever. It was comfortable.

Apparently Margaret didn’t agree. She shivered uncomfortably under my arm. I raised my eyebrows. “Need your coat?” I asked. I tried to look at her and make non-verbal communication as explicit as possible until I realized that we were lost inky blackness of the Mouth. I bit my lip and waited, but she didn’t respond. For a couple minutes we walked in silence. She stopped and stood motionless. I stopped, too.

“Why the hell are we even in here?” she said. She sounded irritated. I shrugged – more to appease myself than her – and shoved my flashlight under my face. Bladed shadows obscured half my face, the other half illuminated in a wretched mask. “Spooky!” I cried, chuckling. She didn’t move.

I sighed. “I thought you wanted to go,” I said. I noticed how my voice echoed against the cave walls at any volume. “I mean,” I began again, scratching at my chin, “You did say you wanted to go see some nature for our vacation. And you did sound impressed when I told you about my visit to Mammoth Caves a couple years back. So…” My voice trailed off. I could still sense her irritation.

“No,” she said. I frowned. “No, you wanted to go here. I wanted to go to a beach or something. But no, a cave. A cave, Nathan!” She sounded more like the Big Bad Wolf now. “I know that you have this weird fetish for spelunking or something, but I don’t really want to be dragged in to it. Don’t get me wrong, I’d love to go on a trip and get into nature and fresh air, but this,” I could hear her arms flail and gesture about in the thick air. “This is cave air, not fresh air. This air is practically fermenting! Plus, isn’t this illegal? Can we please just leave?”

We both stood there. The only sound that could be heard was the electricity in the air being stifled and smothered by the damp atmosphere. Finally, I began to walk. I didn’t hear Margaret follow me, but I kept moving forward. Then, “Nathan,” she said, “Stop. Please stop.” So I stopped.

“I’m sorry,” she said. I could hear her moving closer to me. “I’m tired and I’m not used to running and climbing around and the like. I’m just tired.”

“It’s okay,” I said. She gripped my arm. “Really. It’s fine.” I shook my head. “Which way is out? I don’t remember.” I could feel Margaret physically pause. Neither of us could remember. Somehow, in the confusion of our argument, I’d forgotten which way we had been moving. Idiot, I thought to myself, I should have brought a goddamn rope or something to trail from the entrance of the cave. I had to take action, so without much thought, I turned 180 degrees and said, “This way.”

We walked for what seemed to be hours. My feet were tired and sore, and I could hear Margaret’s groans from behind me. She held my hand tightly. I felt terrible. This was my fault.

Then, I froze. “Hey. Hey,” I said, “Put your hand out. Feel this rock.” I could hear Margaret’s bare palm press against the stone. “Isn’t this, like…abnormally warm?” I said. She didn’t say anything. I began to work my way along the wall, feeling it as I went, shining the flashlight in front of me. Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain on my head as the ceiling of God’s Mouth met with my scalp.

“Ow! Shit!” I shouted.

“Oh, Nick, are you okay?” Margaret asked. She seemed on the verge of panic now.

“I’m fine,” I said. “Please, calm down. We’ll get out of here soon, I promise.”

I started again, pointing my flashlight upwards now to see the ceiling above me. It seemed to be getting narrower. That was strange. “Listen, uh, Margaret, babe,” I said through clenched teeth, “I think we gotta turn around.” Margaret sighed next to me.

Again, we walked for a decent length. I kept my flashlight pointed upwards this time. Sure enough, the space in the cave seemed to become smaller and smaller. If there was any resonating light left in God’s Mouth aside from my flashlight, I’m sure Margaret would have been able to see the whites of my eyes, spreading in panic. We were completely lost.

I let go of Margaret’s hand and began to feverishly feel my way along the walls. “No, Nathan!” I heard her shout. I kept going. We had to get out. If we were lost, nobody would be able to find us.

I kept feeling along the wall until I abruptly hit a corner. “Fuck,” I said aloud. “Margaret, this seems to be a dead end.” I spun around on my heel. “Margaret?” No answer. Shit.

I began to repeat my process again, almost running as I felt the wall run past my fingertips. Cool, damp rocks and jagged spears. Suddenly, I found myself at a corner again. “Fuck fuck fuck,” I shouted. “Margaret!” I was belting her name out now. In the corner of the cave’s maw where I had been thwarted so many times already, I heard a noise. It sounded like muffled static from a television. I pressed my ear against the rock. It seemed to be getting even warmer now. I heard the faint sounds of Margaret on the other side of the rock. She was screaming.

“No no no,” I said. “No no no no no.” I began running haphazardly into the walls around me. With dawning realization came a wave of sheer horror. There was no entrance. There was no exit. Only these four corners and me.

I could feel blood begin to trickle from the cut I managed to get by bashing my body into the cave’s walls. They were closing in on me. They were coming in for the kill, and soon they would be pressing in on my skull and crushing my rib cage.

I sat there for hours, waiting for death. My flashlight was becoming dim and blinking. Finally, I felt the soft touch of these rocky walls press against my back. I began to cry as I lay down on the ground. I let my flashlight roll on the small hills of stone. As I quietly stayed prone, tears dripping down my face, I turned and looked at the flashlight. Its last, fading beams of light pointed at something not far away from my face. I squinted in the darkness. My eyes widened and I felt tears fall even harder from my face. The rocks were piercing my skin now and blood dripped from all sides.

There, in the last light of my flashlight, was the appetizer. The spotlight shone on a hand whose nails were painted red, and I screamed in agony as I watched God’s Mouth chew its latest meal.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/eq7s4/gods_mouth/

59,Freaky twins.,1293011596,"I watched a documentary ages ago about twins and how a lot of them either have psychic abilities or secret twin languages that are completely impossible for anyone to figure out. I mentioned this to a guy I was having beers with last week because I knew he was a twin (we went to primary school together, along with two other sets of twins in the same grade) and asked if he'd had any weird stuff happen between him and his brother. He told me that he had actually been one of three babies but one had died in the womb 6 months into the pregnancy. 
He's completely convinced that he has part of one of the triplets personalities in him that occasionally pops out as if he's been desperate to say something for a couple of years. He often doesn't understand why he's blurted these odd things out but really feels as if it's not him that had this desire to say whatever it was.

He gave me an example of another strange thing his brother and him had experienced that involved two other twins that we went to school with. They were identical twins named Anna and Sarah and they had met before the age of 1 in one of those mothers playground things. Anyway when both sets of twins were learning to talk, the mothers would often hear all four of them speaking quite fluently to each other (around 3 years old) but in words that none of the parents or other children could understand. Around the age of 5 the boys stopped talking in this language and neither of them can really remember anything from it. The girls apparently kept speaking to each other in the same way but only ever when they were having their own private conversations, either in a room with other people or being over heard from their shared bedroom.

Does anyone know of or have any stories about twin languages or telepathy they could share? I'd be really interested in knowing.",nosleep,betty_corp,/r/nosleep/comments/eptgs/freaky_twins/

64,Goose Flesh,1292978774,"It happened quietly and calmly so that I could never have noticed. With only my thoughts and frozen emotion, I began to accept that I'm trapped here now.


It's far too cold to venture outside, the Freezing temperature of my house a welcome jump in relative warmth. That first morning when I had lost sight of the stars, I tried moving beyond the icy containment of my house for a brief moment before the chill struck me immediately. Pain shot through my fingertips and I cried out, pulling back inside, clutching my hand within my coat. Slamming the door and withdrawing my hand to examine the damage, I saw the first signs of it, my algid fingers suddenly darkened with the tiny flares of burst blood vessels. Every further attempt I have made to leave, wrapped in the supposed comfort of every piece of expensive cold-resistant clothing I own, the various chemical warming aids I gathered, to absolutely anything I could still hold in my dead, marred hands to set ablaze seemed to do nothing against holding me captive within my own house.


I thought at first it wasn't something to see or hear at all. I marveled at it, extolling it's pretense, despite my ignorance and fear. I didn't understand why it can come upon me, what I can done to deserve its artifice. As I peered out between the cracks of windows black with ice I strained my eyes for movement, praying for a visage on which I could place my fears and apprehension. And as the harsh wisps of the aberrant winds clawed at my eyes, blurring my vision from force of blood, I would have swore to make out a muddy shade set apart from the colors of the wood. I wish to God I could say it looked familiar in anyway, even as dream or from a forgotten story. My inclement imagination desperately pieced it together, giving it scattered human qualities and trying to make peace with what I had seen. It faded, gangly and nebulous, through the long dead trees and blanket of torrential snows. Before recoiling from the cutting cold and wind in that one excruciating moment, rubbing the pain and blurriness from my eyes, I fooled myself into thinking the crisp sound from beyond my house of fragile, frozen skin stretched and snapping was something distant and natural.


I am almost completely blind now, and the coldest rooms in the house are no longer passable. Little by little, the air slowed and chilled in the outermost rooms, trapping me further and further inside. There is no light left, and I have already burned all the furniture in the room, failing to bring air above freezing. The temperature is dropping quicker now, even as I write this I can feel my brain failing to register the state of my gnarled extremities. I feel blessed that I no longer possess the sight to futilely examine my body for new signs of it's dying tissues. I can hear the strain and snap of the walls around me. I struggle to keep awake, listening in the frozen blackness for that sound of moving shadows.


But I'm fooling myself. I can hear it clearly, the sound of brittle skin cracking, the cold taking my feet and legs, and the endless mass hanging above me feeding on the broken flesh of my face.",nosleep,gmale9000,/r/nosleep/comments/epmf9/goose_flesh/
65,The house by the river.,1292964838,"I am home sick today and thought I would type up what happened to me when I was younger. I'm trying to think of it as I type, so I'm sorry if it's messy and I'm not a great writer and it may not be very frightening, but it is all true.  
  
It was probably 1992 the summer that we moved into the house by the river. After we had lived in a shady apartment complex for what seemed like forever, my mom found this nice place for rent after coming out of a divorce. It was gorgeous; huge yard, little brook to the right, a bit of forest to the left, a little beach type of area just beyond a set of train tracks. My bedroom was the size of a walk-in closet, but it was all the room I needed; I had a bed, a small dresser, and even a trunk at the foot of my bed. My older brother (For the sake of the story I will call him Billy) got the larger room; it had a narrow closet, two windows, and the crawl space into the attic. My mom had the only bedroom that faced the train tracks and river.  We settled in easily and enjoyed the rest of our summer.  
  
When school started I began sleepwalking, every night I would go into my mothers room and push her so she would let me under the covers, my mom thought it was funny and would remark to people about it. Well, one night my Aunt was babysitting Billy and me while my mom was attending nursing school. I was told the next day that I had scared my Aunt, apparently, about 2 hours after we were put to bed I had gotten up, my aunt was downstairs so I don’t know if I did anything beforehand, but I started walking down the stairs, I sat down around the middle step and just started bawling my eyes out. My aunt told me that she asked me repeatedly what was wrong and I was non-responsive so she decided I was sleepwalking, as my mom told her would probably happen, she picked me up and put me in bed, I didn’t remember any of it.  
  
I don’t know when my mom decided to get us a babysitter, she certainly had enough sisters who were willing to watch us for free, but she must have been tired of asking for favors. The babysitter hated me, though I typically minded my own business and entertained myself, she would sometimes lock me out… I’ll call her Cori. Well Cori brought a Ouija board over one day, it must have been Spring or Summer of 1993 because the back door was open to let a breeze in through the screen door. I was doodling and watching cartoons, trying to ignore Billy and Cori so I wouldn’t get locked out. They were playing with the Ouija board in the hallway right next to me, but I wasn’t paying attention. My brother tells me to come over, that the Ouija board is spelling things out, so I go to look and an argument erupts about who is moving the planchette, the babysitter wasn’t much older than my brother, so arguments happened often. Suddenly, there was a knock at the back door, all three of us can see it, the edge of the hallway was right next to the door, and nobody was there. Cori slowly got up, shut the door, and locked it as we all shared a nervous giggle. Then, began the rapid pounding on the side of the house next to the door. It came from the ceiling, too as we huddled together. 20 long seconds passed, the noise getting louder and louder, my mom’s mirror crashed to the floor and it stopped. We all ran out the front door and sat in the gravel driveway, Cori looked around the house, returning to us with no evidence of intruders or vandals. This house wasn’t in the suburbs, we didn’t have neighbors, we didn’t live anywhere near our school friends who could play pranks on us. Not to mention that the house was on a steep hill and that side of the house was on stilts, far too high for anyone to be knocking on so rapidly. We all played with the Ouija board a few more times, Billy would spend that Fall trying to destroy it; leaving it on the train tracks to be run over, finding it intact, throwing it into the river, finding it washed up; it went on, but he finally got rid of it somehow. Soon after, for unrelated reasons, the babysitter was fired. I can’t recollect anything that it spelled out that day, but now I can only remember one thing that it ever spelled out, a name, George Bess. The Ouija board said that George cooked for and boarded people who worked on the trains that passed by, that he was a good person who was trying to keep evil away.  
  
Since there was no babysitter anymore, I got to stay home alone for the first time when I was maybe 8-9 years old. I was doodling in a coloring book with the TV on for some ambience and I broke my crayon, stupid me for pressing down too hard. No problem, though, I would go upstairs to get my tub of crayons, might as well get some more colors anyway. I headed on up to my room, but as soon as my foot hit the third step dogs started barking; big, loud, vicious sounding dogs, at least two of them. The barking came from every direction. I dashed up the stairs, the barking continued until I whipped around to face down the steps again. I looked around me, grabbed my bearings and ran straight down the steps (jumping over the third), out the back door and onto the porch. I walked around a little bit, looking for some dogs, seeing if maybe they had gotten into the basement, but the door outside to the basement was locked. So I sat on the porch and waited for Billy and Mom to get home…   
My mom was very understanding when I told her the story, there was no doubt in her eyes and it was comforting to know that she believed everything that happened to me, to my brother, and that house. When we moved out, she told me everything that happened to her in that house, too. The reason she knew Billy and I were telling the truth about the Ouija board, the dogs barking, Billy’s claims of hearing pigs squealing and seeing disembodied hands. She went on to tell me about one of the first weekends she spent alone in that house while Billy and I had visitation with our father. She was tidying up and unpacking, she said it sounded like a plane crashed into the house, the bang was so loud, so she went outside, as far away into the yard that she could go to try to see some of the roof, of course there was nothing there. Another time while Billy and I were away, my mom heard a baby crying. As I mentioned, we had no neighbors, it was rare to hear much noise. My mom thought someone had gotten into a car accident and had a baby with them, so she peered out the window, put on a jacket, and as soon as she opened the door the crying stopped. My mom sill looked, though, she walked down the road a bit, searched the yard, searched the train tracks… No baby… Nothing. We moved out in 1996, there are some more stories from that house that I’m trying to remember. The house we moved into wasn’t any better, though I did stop sleepwalking as soon as we moved.

72,Mirrors,1292901694," One of my FB friends had it on their profile, but they never mentioned where it came from, if it was a personal story, or w/e. However, this story/concept always terrifies me to the point that I cannot read it due to not being able to look in mirrors for about a week after reading. Someone should try the holding up the hair thing and let me know how it goes, I'm too wimpy to do it myself XD 

(I also sent this to creepypasta once, and they took and butchered it, but here's the original) 

""The images we see in the mirror are the incarnations of pure evil. They are only allowed to exist in the area reflected in the glass. To them, life is a never ending hell. Rotting away in the same room day after day. The only refuge from this purgatory is death, and the only way for them to die, sad to say, is if YOU die.
Fortunately, they are bound by a code. You are their master, and they must mimic your every movement and expression. To do otherwise would break an unbreakable law, unraveling space and time. However, there is a loophole, and it can only be triggered by you, the master.
To force them into error is to free them from their contract; after you let them out of your view, you're on your own, very vulnerable to revenge for years of captivity. Know this: When you watch them, they're watching you back. They're watching. And they're thinking.

A NOTE TO THE DARING:
The next time you're alone in your room, turn down the lights. Think of something on your body that varies in length, such as hair. It must be clearly viewable from your perspective. Grab a ruler and, looking in the mirror, quickly grab a hair at random; you must confuse it. Hold it in position as best you can and note the length. Look down. Yours will be different.
DO NOT LOOK BACK UP. No matter what, don't turn your back to that mirror ever again.

The next time you wake up groggy and tired, don't move. Take a glance at your mirror; if you're lucky, you might catch a smile.

There's a tale from when I was young, although I never held much stock in it. I mean it was just a spooky story that was told to scare kids right? Thing is, one day I used google to find it, turns out that it's a common belief in Chinese tradition. From it I've taken one thing, never ever sleep with a mirror facing your bed. That's when they like to watch you. Those envious ones trapped on the other side. Some people say that they are dopplegangers other stories say that they are people who have disappeared over the centuries, never found without a trace, dragged into their own reflection never to be seen again. They're envious of us, our world of life and light, they're trapped in their little windowed world looking for ways through, hiding and reflecting so that they are seen to be innocent reflections, things that can't possibly hurt you. It's a lie, a common thing that has been forgotten over the years. Ever woken up in the evening and one of your limbs has been hanging out the bed and it's deathly cold... you've just encountered one of them. They'd seen you were asleep and tried to drag you away. If you'd have stayed asleep you'd have awoken and found yourself to be in a terrible place, although that's speculation. They can't survive outside the mirror world very long, after being trapped there they get dependent on the energies that sustain it and it's out of spite and malice they drag you there too, away from your loved ones and real people, trapped with the lonely and spiteful for the rest of time.

All mirrors are actually windows to another world.
This world cannot be reached, and shouldn't be reached, as all our mirror-selves are extremely malicious.
Try watching the edge of the mirror after sneaking into a room.
If you're good enough, you can see your reflection, pressing against the glass.""

Anyway, after I submitted the story I turned off my laptop and went to the kitchen to get some orange juice, as I am quite sick right now. As I'm walking into the kitchen, I notice some movement in my peripheral vision. I turn to look and I see my iPod, which has been missing for a couple of days. I had been tearing up the house for the past couple of days looking for the damn thing as I like to listen to music when I drive, so I was quite happy to see it. But then it slowly started to dawn on me that something was strange about this. First of all, 1) what the hell did I see moving and 2) my iPod was standing straight up on it's bottom in the center of the table, which seems like a very deliberate way to put an iPod down on a table. 

Now let it be known that there was NOTHING on my table earlier in the day, and that includes objects besides the iPod, so there wasn't any clutter that it could have been hiding behind. I wasn't really freaked out or anything, but it was at this moment that I decided I needed to just go to bed and forget the orange juice, as I was pretty uncomfortable at this point. There have been a couple more incidents that I know of of this not-really-scary-but-pretty-damn-weird stuff happening here, but I think I'll save those for another day.

77,It was a cloudless summer day...,1292840223,"...which makes this story all the more surreal. 

I was on a road trip with my then girlfriend Julia, we were headed for my families beach house in a place called 'Cook's Beach' about two hours drive from where I lived. We had a cassette playing (I would like to think it was Pink Floyd) and I was driving a little over the speed limit to try and promote the circulation of cooler air (no AC) through the open windows.

It seemed like an ordinary drive until we passed the sign: 'Welcome to Cook's Beach,' that's when things got weird...

The tape playing suddenly didn't sound right, it was discordant, like an orchestra tuning for a concert but far worse, the vocals washed out and a darker sounding white noise filled the car. I felt very sick and had to turn the tape off. I looked over at Julia and her expression was a sort of unhappy I had never seen before. It was passing though, it was a moment and I might have imagined it but I never wanted to see anyone look like that again. I asked her if she was okay, she said she was fine and not seeing the fear behind her eyes we carried on. 

We arrived at the house but I stayed parked at the letterbox for at least a minute, we were both silent. I decided I would reverse into the driveway and I did so whilst refusing to look in the rear view mirror, using only the fence to my right as a guide. When I finally parked close enough to the door, we both got out and moved as quickly as we could into the house... I still refused to look behind me.

Once I was through the door I closed the blinds so I couldn't see behind the house and this is why:

It's an image that came into my mind. A creature: gaunt, cat like, hairless, grey, winged (maybe, I'm not to sure anymore) and white eyed. Behind that a tall figure, black, hooded and thin. This is what I was convinced I would see if I dared look outside.

I looked at Julia, I suggested we have something to eat, neither of us wanted to go outside though so we inquired as to whether there was anything in the freezer, there was. We put the two frozen meals into the microwave and sat down on the couch waiting for them to heat up.

I held her in my arms, but it didn't feel like her. It felt like an empty shell. I was horrified with myself, how could I think this of the girl I loved? I looked into her eyes and there I saw it... that fear...

'We should leave' I said
'Yes' said Julia in a relieved whimper.

We both ran to the car and got inside, still I dared not look behind me. I turned the key and it wouldn't start. I cried... briefly yes but nonetheless I couldn't remember the last time I had cried and I don't think I have since. I turned the key again and the car started, I floored it. 

I could feel the creatures eyes on me, watching, and until we had passed the sign: 'You are now leaving Cook's Beach' my heart was filled with an unbearable dread.

Julia and I drove silently for at least ten minutes before we both simultaneously let out a sigh of relief that came with a warmth that filled my whole body. We just looked at each other with a sort of 'what the hell was that' kind of look. I suggested we stop somewhere to eat, remembering that we had left behind the microwave dinners.

Over lunch we discussed what had just happened, how we had both felt a profound uneasiness and we had both seen a creature in our minds that we feared would be realized when we looked behind the house. I asked her to describe the creature... Gaunt, cat like, hairless, grey, winged and white eyed. Behind that a tall figure, black, hooded and thin...

A month later, after some family politics and the death of my uncle, the beach house was sold. I have never and will never return to that place.

81,"Why I get ""no sleep"" during the holiday season.",1292776146,"   It's taken me a long time to be able to talk about this incident with anyone, let alone complete strangers, so if you could spare me your trolling, it would be greatly appreciated.

   At the time of the incident, and many years after, I thought the word the old man spoke was ""Grumpus"" or ""Grampis"", it wasn't until years later that I stumbled upon an article online about Krampus. You can imagine my shock at the discovery that the most horrific experience of my life, an experience I had convinced myself was a hallucination, had ties to an ancient myth. Such a discovery has lead me to believe perhaps I'm not as I previously thought. Perhaps it's the world we live in, the very existense we're taking part in, that is insane.






   I don't have the best memory. Over the years, most of my life has become a gray-colored blur, pieced together by photographs from my mom's family albums. But I have one memory that I have stored in vivid detail, and can't shake, no matter how hard I try.
   
   It was sometime in December, before Christmas. I was about 8 years old. Me and my older brother Michael had just gotten out of school and were walking home with a few of my brother's friends. We lived a good distance from the school that we went to, so our parents arranged it so that after school we could walk to my brother's friend Harry's house until one of our parents got off of work and could come pick us up. My brother and his friends were all about 12 years old and were at that strange age where kids try really hard to be cool, often saying and doing things without really thinking about what they were doing, hoping that out of these various desperate actions, one of them would impress those around them.
   
   It snowed a lot where we lived, so every day on the way home they would hide behind a snow bank and pelt the cars passing by with snowballs. I was always a nervous child, so their hobby always involved me imploring them to stop so we can go home, which almost always earned me an onslaught of snowballs thrown in my direction.
   
   On this particular day, my brother and his friends decided to try throwing snowballs at the pedestrians walking down a fairly popular street. It wasn't called ""main street"", but it might as well have been. At one point in the road, the shops stopped and at the other end of the block, there was a suburb. People in this suburb would often walk from their houses to the shops, since it wasn't unusal for the roads to be covered in ice.
   
   The spot they chose for their sniper's nest was in a vacant lot next to one of the last shops on the street, which sort of marked where the shops ended. They figured this spot would provide a good flow of pedestrians and an adequit amount of snow. They built a half circle wall of snow that went almost up to their chests that they were very proud of. They hit a few adults, most of them taking it well and often returning fire. A few of them threatened that they knew who our parents were and that our parents would be hearing about this.
   
   Michael and his friends decided that they should wrap it up and head home, but not before they had one more victim. They waited and watched the edge of the building, anxious for their next prey. An elderly man slowly made his way down the street. He had a black wooden cane which shook as he walked, as though the weight of the world was being supported by it. One of my brother's friends decided that given the fragility of the old man, they should let him pass and wait for another target. My brother wasn't having it. Eager to prove how rebelious he was, my brother threw a snowball and hit the old man with a solid shot to the side of his head, knocking off his hat and exposing underneath a shiney bald head. The old man had been startled by the attack, and looked frightened for a moment. After seeing us his fear melted into a smile and a laugh. The man bent slowly and painfully to pick up his hat, wiping it off and placing it back on his head. He spoke in an accent I had yet to hear at that age, ""Be careful, young ones. Der Krampus is watching!"" and continued walking with a smile.
   
   My brother and his friends looked at each other with confusion on their faces. My brother, still caught up in his annoying need to prove himself, decided he needed to bring the prank to a new level. He ran up alongside the man, snatching the cane from his arthritic hand as he passed. The old man went down face first, instinct making the hand opposite to the cane try to break his fall to no avail. He landed hard and helplessly. A pain-filled cry came from the old man. My brother realized instantly that he had gone too far. He walked slowly toward the old man, his eyes wide. ""Mister? Are you okay?"", he said as he crouched down next to the old man, who now appeared to have passed out or died. ""Is he alive?"" One of my brother's friends asked. They we're standing around the old man's body. My brother put his ear up to the old man's mouth trying to find a sign of life. Everyone held their breath, wide-eyed with fear. My brother leaned in closer, desparation in his face. The old man's hand grabbed my brother's jacket by the collar and pulled his ear up to his mouth. He spit a blood-curdling growl of angry foreign words into my brother's ear. I don't think I've ever seen a face display such anger. Once he had finished the string of what I assumed were foreign curse words, he released my brother from his grip.
   
   We immediately ran to Harry's house, not stopping or talking all the way. We didn't speak of what happened with the old man, other than to agree on an alibi for where we were in case we got in trouble.
   
   The night went on as any night typically did. We ate dinner, after which my brother and I went to do homework in the room we shared while our parents went to the living room to drink. We weren't allowed to listen to the radio while we did homework, as dad said it would be too distracting, so we worked in mind-numbing silence. Silence, until, a few quiet scrapes on the window. The kind of scraping sound that catches the glass at just the right angle and makes that ""eee"" sound. ""Eee eee eee"". We both turned and looked at the window. The upper corner of the window had been cleared of frost and snow, leaving a strange pattern on the window, as if cleared away with a crude brush made of fine twigs and grass. Nothing could be seen through the clearing, just darkness. Both scared, we ran to our parents and told them that someone was in the yard and that they were looking through our window. Our father went outside to investigate. He came back, laughing a little. ""You boys had a visiter, alright. A deer. There are hoof prints all along the side of the house. Probably scraped his antlers on the window.""
   
   By the time we finished our homework, it was time for bed. We changed and got in our beds. All was quiet as I slowly fell asleep.
   
   The sound of a door opening. The front door. I could hear it swing open and hit the wall, something I had been scolded for doing several times. I remember thinking that it was strange that my dad would open the front door and not close it behind him. The footsteps coming in sounded strange. Too heavy, as though there was a very large man wearing heavy boots walking through our living room. The sounds of the two feet were accompanied by a third sound, this one less heavy with a wooden tone to it. My eyes were fixed on the door. At this point, all I could see was the wall of the hallway, which was dimly illuminated by a street light shining through the living room window. The deep thuds continued deeper into the house. I could tell it was getting closer to the hallway with each step. It was at that point that the thing walked past the light being projected on the hallway wall. I couldn't believe the shape I had seen. This must be a nightmare. I clenched my eyes shut, hoping that when I opened them again, I'd be back in the waking world, in my bed, doors closed, everyone sleeping. I kept my eyes shut, the footsteps continued. They slowed in pace as they reached the doorway to our room. Then, a grunt. This person didn't grunt like most people. Their grunt was accompanied by a quick, deep exhale. I could hear slow, steady breathing at the doorway. Maybe it was just my dad, I thought. I decided to open my eyes. It stood still in the doorway, taking up most of the opening. It stood there for what seemed like minutes before it lowered and tilted its head to the side moving through the door. It had to do this manuver to get its head through. On either side of the head were two curved sticks pointing toward its back. Horns. This person had horns. As it came into the room, I could make out more of the creature. It's body was strange and big and appeared to be covered in matted fur. It carried a large dead branch as a walking stick. Its back was big and miss-shapen. It ws too round. The creature smelled of mould and dirt, as if it had been rotting underground. It made its way over to Michael's bed. I noticed at this point that my brother had been awake this whole time too, also paralysed by fear. The beast was almost to his bed when he began screaming ""NO! NOOO!"" He tried to jump out of bed, but was stopped by the thing's black claw. The thing grabbed Michael by his arm and pulled him closer, grabbing him by the neck. It lifted him up until he was eye level with the beast. My brother wriggled and screamed, trying his best to escape the creature's grasp, but his attempts were futile, as the beast had incredible strength and my brother's struggle didn't move him in the slightest. My brother eventually gave up and hung there crying. The beast brought my brother's face closer to his. A long, red tongue exited the beast's mouth, licking the tears from my brother's face. It savored each tear as though nothing could taste better.

[This is a picture of my sister and I Christmas 08](http://imgur.com/IYWbE)

About a week before Christmas in 08, I received a call saying my Grandpa passed away at the ripe age of 85. I was upset since he was the closed Grandfather I had alive. I was in Phoenix and he was in Anaheim, luckily it was my last day of school before Christmas, so after class I jumped on a flight and went to Cali (My mom works for Delta and flies stand by all the time (flies free if there are seats available). Upon getting there we started going through my Grandparents things since they were both gone now. I found some really cool things, such as a picture of Reagan and Elvis, a badge that looks like something from the Pony Express (haven't figured out what it is from), as well as a TV guide from like the late 50s or 60s. Upon leaving Cali and making my way back to Ohio with my parents, we tried to get a flight out, the day before Christmas Eve.  Long story short, we couldn't find a flight and had to drive from Cali to Ohio, straight. This is a 36 hour drive, so we had plenty of time to think about everything. We got home and my mom wanted to take pictures with the tree since it was Christmas Eve. The first picture that was taken was the one posted above. When my mom looked at it she bursted into tears and said she knew it was my Grandpa. We all shared a tear and a smile. He always said that he suggested everyone at least once drive across country and really get to enjoy the natural beauty in this world.

I've never been superstitious, religious or illogical about the world we live in but I still have not been able to explain the following. I may be preaching to the choir but I feel you guys may be able to help explain what has happened.

My house is surrounded by prairie and after a few hundred feet, woods but I've never seen anything out of the ordinary outside of deer and occasionally coyotes. Nothing odd has ever happened that has caused me to question my sanity.
A year or so ago I was arriving home after having ridden the bus home from school. (no car at this point in time) My house is up on a very tall hill so I began to walk up it as usual. Nothing strange happened here. Then, as I was getting up to the house and walking around to the back door, I saw something in the prairie. It was a black..thing, it had four legs and was medium sized. Bigger than a large dog, but smaller than anything I could relate to. I rounded the corner of my house and ran after it, and it disappeared around a bend in a path that had been mown in the prairie. I ran up to the head of the path and looked down it, and in the prairie but nothing was there. What makes it even scarier is that the prairie in this area was fairly sparse, and could not hide something of the size that I saw. Nothing can explain what it was as my neighbors don't own dogs and are extremely few and far between in my area, so it couldn't have been something else.

Okay, second story. I was laying in bed one night, in my bedroom that has large bay windows that faced the moon. This was in the middle of summer so the windows were open, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary until I tried to fall asleep. Typically it takes me anywhere from 10-30 minutes to fall asleep. Just as I was about to fall asleep, or about 10 minutes after attempting to I heard a noise. First, it sounded like two animals were fighting outside my second story window and oddly my mind dismissed this as normal even if I'd never heard it before then. The animals were shrieking, growling and rustling around in the prairie outside and I was still keeping my eyes closed, trying to ignore it. Then, as if it were a final call into the night, I heard a very loud and ear-splitting shriek that to this day I don't understand. It's almost like the sound of a very large, insect-like alien dying in movies or video games. A cross between a bird and a very large animal that curdles the blood. I froze, not sure what to do except close my eyes and mentally freak out. I didn't move until I somehow fell asleep and woke up the next day, unsure of what happened.",nosleep,cfoust,/r/nosleep/comments/enzr7/first_unexplainable_experiences_came_to_rnosleep/

sorry to those who were wanting an all inclusive thread in regards to my bigfoot encounter(s), but this is more convenient for the sake of length.

these stories, you see, might not be entirely connected...because my second encounter with bigfoot was hard to tell. this time around it was 2006...and this time around it was in the pitch blackness of the woods.

three of us daringly set out to experience the presence of bigfoot once again. this was not our first time back in the woods since the first meeting nor was it the first time looking for the creature again.

our group started out as five, but as soon as we hit the woods, two cowardly bowed out. we entered the woods with a flashlight and nothing more. it was the middle of the summer and very dark inside the woods due to the thickness of the brush.

walking rather cautiously for about 20 minutes, we reached deeper and deeper into the woods. once we came upon a small stream within the woods, we heard something ELSE among us.

a loud crash sounded directly in front of us...terrified that we had been spotted by whatever was with us in the woods, we all immediately whispered to turn the flashlight off. standing there in the dark, we heard the noise again. a very loud crash. the sound of something metal hitting something else metal. a very odd sound for it being heard in the middle of the woods.

after about a minute of these loud crashes, the worst thing happened...it got quiet. it was so horrifying standing there in the middle of the woods in the dark; silent; standing so very close to this beast. the dead give away that it wasn't a human was the piercing low growl it emitted after another minute of silence. we could feel the breath of this creature as it snarled at us. we were that close.

to say that we ran would be an understatement. totally disregarding the trail, we all split up escaping to the outside. once we were out of the woods we did not look back. we continued to run all the way home.

this was my last encounter with the fiend, whatever it may have been. for the sake of classification, it matched very well with other bigfoot descriptions, so i decided to call it bigfoot. as i've said before, the beast in the first encounter could have been entirely different, but the events were so similar...in my mind it was the same. 

i have been back to those woods many, many times after this encounter, and still have yet to experience anything else. occasionally we hear noises, but nothing significant enough to call an ""encounter."" thank you and goodnight.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/enqxt/bigfoot_encounter_2/
0,I had to get the hell out of there.,1292634579,"My apartment is separated into two adjoining rooms with an upstairs 'loft area' above the kitchen/dining room. My bedroom = my office and I heat it with a space heater. It's been fucking cold, so I keep the door to the kitchen area closed mainly and only heat my room. I live above a restaurant that is supposedly haunted, and over the past few months, I'm becoming increasingly convinced that it may be (or, at the very least, the idea of it being so is messing with my head).

I have a number of stories that I'm willing to share, but first I just wanted to post this and hopefully get some feedback from the fine folks here at /r/nosleep. 

Synopsis: The door between the two rooms has been opening itself lately (i don't latch it, but it's relatively heavy and with a lack of a significant breeze, i can't see how it would open). 

The other night i was working late (timestamp on the audio says 3:33am). My back faces the door when i sit at my desk. Door opens, hits my chair, i swivel, go 'wtf.' and close it. i hear some noises in the other room so i stop for a tediously long 10 seconds and listen. it sounds like someone is rummaging through my cabinets. brilliant idea occurs: voice memo app on my iphone. so i open the door like 1/2"" and place the phone in the space and record the following:

(you can hear the rummaging i mentioned in the very beginning of the recording)

then i got the fuck outta there.

sound analyzers, do your thing and tell me this is, i don't know, something other than paranormal. 

Edit: by ""live above a restaurant"" I mean my apartment is adjacent to the outer courtyard in back of the restaurant. 

Edit 2: I've received a few requests from people to share more, so...I've got quite a few stories from over the years. For now though I'll post some tales pertinent to what I think that sound was and go backwards from there to the first moment I started to agree that this restaurant may be haunted. 

Edit 3: after about ten cigarettes and a failed attempt to wake my downstairs neighbor, I went back up and surveyed with a light and a recorder. There was nothing. No drawers open, nothing out of place. no sign that anything had been present to disturb the residence. ",nosleep,Operahat,/r/nosleep/comments/enpb9/i_had_to_get_the_hell_out_of_there/

7,bigfoot encounter #1,1292566417,"what i am about to tell all of you is very real. it happened in the fall of 2003 and has left a mark on me ever since.

it was a friday, and the only reason i remember it was a friday is because i used to have friends over during that particular time on friday evenings. we used to play video games and other things normal typical teenage boys used to do, but that's neither here nor there.

my friends and i were immensely interested in the paranormal...and during times of boredom or times of spontaneous adventure, we liked to wonder around the woods behind my mom's house, which is still standing to this very day.

these woods were typical woods. dark, forbidden, and creepy at night. nothing was ever expected to be seen or heard in these woods...we just liked to scare ourselves. it was...""fun.""

fun, until after exiting the woods on that particular friday night in the fall of 2003. as we were walking away from the woods, we saw a dark figure walking in the darkness of a shadow casted by a telephone poll. not until the figure moved out of the shadow did we see that it wasn't just a random man walking around at midnight on a friday  night. it was something else.

this creature was walking as fast as any human could run. it's giant step span was a dead give away. this was not a human. once we noticed that it was something other than a fellow man or any animal that we've ever seen we SPRINTED all the way back to my mom's house. 

that was the first and last time i ever seen this creature, but it was not my last encounter with it...that is for another time though. thank you and goodnight.

A week or so before Halloween I decided I wanted it and started tracking down someone who could claim ownership over the studio, and by extension the picture.  I looked up the business on google and tried to call the listed number, but it was disconnected.  So I called the city and tried to find out who owned the building.  It turns out the man who owned the studio and took the picture had died recently.  I was given the number to someone who owned a business in the building next door to the studio.  I spoke to them a few times and got the number to the current owner of the property.  I called that number several times, and no one ever picked up no matter how long it rang.  After a month I decided to try the guy next door and see if there was another way I could contact the owner or get into the building.  It's been a few weeks and he hasn't answered his phone either, and his voicemail box is full.

11,Haunted Suburbia,1292546739,"We moved into our house in 1981. I was 5, and have been described as a ""spooky"" little kid. I had ESP, like a lot of little kids, before they grow up, and lose that special sight. Our house was nothing special...a split foyer home on a nondescript street, in a nondescript suburb of DC. It was built in the 60's, on what was once farmland.

I was bubbling with joy on moving day, and walked through the front door for my first view of the new home. First I went upstairs... I didn't notice the details my folks did in that empty house. While I was doing cartwheels in the living room, they were puzzling over the odd things the previous owners had left. Namely the bottle of holy water in the closet, and a crucifix in each room. ""jesus Freaks,"" my mom told me years later. That was their original verdict.

Then, I went downstairs to explore. It was a finished basement, with two bedrooms, a bathroom, a den...and a really friggin creepy shadowy cold spot right to the left of the stairs, in front of the storage closet. I bolted upstairs and announced to my amused parents, ""The downstairs is  haunted and I am never ever going back down there."" I don't remember what made me say that, other than that...that....FEELING. It was dark and sinister, and I felt something was going to reach out of the shadow and grab me with long raspy green fingers.

The odd thing was, I was 5. I was sheltered. My knowledge of ghosts came from Scooby Doo. My parents didn't watch horror movies, and this was before the advent of VCRs and cable tv.  I just KNEW. I KNEW something was going to get me if I went back.
 
Eventually, I relented to going back down there. After all, they put the TV there, and my playroom. Ah, my playroom. I had to cross the shadow to get in there. It was ok once i got in there, besides feeling like something was watching me sometimes. I started noticing that it wasn't just me that bolted up the stairs. My mom quickened her pace, until she reached the foyer. So would Dad. And our dog would tuck her tail between her legs and run, staying to the far side of the steps (away from the shadow).

Once I reached my teens, I still ran up the steps, but by then it was just habit. The playroom turned into my bedroom, but most nights I slept upstairs on the couch, telling myself it was because the basement was so chilly. I thought of my youthful fear, and wondered why all the dread? The shadowy spot was still creepy, but I hadn't felt the sheer terror of knowing I was about to be snatched by the evilness. In fact, I hadn't felt that vibe since I was kid.

I mentioned it to my mom, talking about how silly I was growing up. She told me I hadn't been silly, and I hadn't been imagining things. It was then, that I first heard about the holy water and crucifixes. Mom had decided they were left on purpose. She explained that I hadn't felt the evil in years because she told it to leave. A good friend with an interest in supernatural things had explained how to ""exorcise"" any bad spirits. She tried it late one night, feeling like a total dumb-ass...but she said there was an immediate change in the air. The oppressiveness of that hallway lifted.

Although, the real fun started after that spirit/demon/whatever the hell it was left the house. Apparently, when confronting the supernatural, you explain that you mean no harm. And that the being is welcome to stay if IT means no harm. Unbeknownst to us, there was something else in that house that decided to stick around and abide by our rules.

Want me to tell you about it?

14,What a horrible way to wake up...,1292536644,"After waking from quite a deep slumber, I continued to lay in bed, eyes closed, expecting silence and the sound of water running in my fish tank. Things that would put me back to sleep. But instead I heard footsteps in the bathroom. While the sound of naked feet on the cold tile typically doesn't startle me, I mentally guaged that it was far too early for my girlfriend to be home.

I opened my eyes and stared nervously at the closed bathroom door, not sure what to expect. Next came the flushing of the toilet, and then running water in the sink. But to my shock, the door did not open. Only the footsteps continued. Off of the cold tile, they moved at a normal pace out of the bathroom. Paralyzed by my fear of this unknown entity, I could do nothing but continue staring at the bathroom door. The footsteps dragged slightly on the carpet, as if someone had trouble lifting their feet. It became louder as it dragged closer to my bed. Closer, closer...

And to my shock, I could feel whatever it was climb into bed with me! The corner of the bed sagged, and I felt it move on its hands and knees towards the empty space next to me. Still paralyzed, I closed my eyes with no expectations of salvation. Only the sounds of the springs in the mattress shifting for this... whatever it was... crawling into bed.

It plopped down in the space next to me, and for a few moments, there was a sense of frozen time and space. The hairs on my neck lifted, and I felt very cold. Very, very cold. Nothing shifted or moved, and I could hear only the fishtank bubbling and spitting water from its filter.  

Nervously, I slowly cracked open my eyes and saw that nothing was around. The bed felt empty again. But the whole room still felt different. Like something wasn't right. Shifting my gaze to the bathroom door again, I noticed a dragging sound on the carpet. Soft at first, but then the sound became louder, like whatever was being dragged became heavier as it traveled around the room. Round and round it went, stopping long enough to change direction and then continue on its path. In my fear, I attempted to shout stop. I tried and tried to push it out, but my mouth wouldn't shape the words and my lungs wouldn't push. I was trapped.

As one last test of sanity, I slowly shifted my hands up from my chest to my face to cover my eyes. I closed them and felt my palms rest on my skin, expecting the darkness of my hands to shade my eyes and crowd out the noise. But the phantom dragging continued, and the world did not become any darker.

Shocked, I opened my eyes, and realized that my hands were not there. Nor my wrists. Only two empty jacket sleeves staring back at me.",nosleep,FloatingBloated,/r/nosleep/comments/en1x6/what_a_horrible_way_to_wake_up/

This is for all the Australians out there, who watched ABC's ""For the Juniors"" during the 80's (possibly early 90's).

Does anyone remember the episode where a kid was staying a his grandparent's house and at the end of the hallway stood an old grandfather clock? Each night at the strike of midnight the a tiger would appear and walk (dance) down the hall, towards his bedroom.
The thing that made this really creepy was that the clock and tiger were luminescent and could be split into parts, each part controlled by unseen puppeteers, so you had this scary dancing clock with an even scarier dancing tiger that could disassemble and reassemble themselves at will.

Does anyone know the name or production date of that episode?

17,Men In Black...,1292495743,"Alright, so this is less of a scary story as it is unexplained and just eerie.

My brother was in his early twenties and had a child with this girl that lived about 15 minutes out of town from where we lived. Due to visitation, my brother got to see him every other weekend. At this same time, I was 14 and just had gotten my learner's permit (this is in South Dakota btw, which has a really young driving age). Well one of the times, my mother and brother thought it would be alright to let me drive them to get my nephew, so that is what we did. 

Now note that this evening fell at the end of Fall and just before winter. There was no snow on the ground but the temperature was extremely low and the wind was extremely strong, I mean this was the type of weather that would take the breath from you because its so cold. One would be crazy to stand out in it even if they were dressed for it.

Though there was an interstate that we could have used, my mother thought it would be best to drive on this older highway that runs parallel to the interstate. On our way back, just before we got to our hometown, we noticed something strange. There had seemed to be this black car, fairly new for the time and of decent make (Mercedes perhaps), that was pulled off to the right side of the road, its trunk was open and this odd figure was standing behind it. This would seem like a normal situation except the figure was just standing there as if locked in this position, nothing moving on its body except for this bright white hair covering its face and blowing violently in the strong winds. It was facing towards a field across the road from its car. This person or whatever it was looked so odd... it wasn't holding itself to block from the cold and wind, instead it just stood there, like a mannequin with its hands held out in front of it and curled up like it were a dead body with rigor mortis or something. 

Shocked, confused, and really curious, my mother and brother tell me to slow down the car so we can get a good look and see if this...thing...needed help. So I slow down and we conspicuously look at this thing, like a family looking at wild animals on a trail or something, and we notice that it's really short, skinny, and frail, like an old woman...and its extremely white hair just seemed so peculiar. We tried to get a good look at its face, but the wind was blowing its hair and covering it like I mentioned...and it didn't even acknowledge us... it just stood there completely still aside from the wind blowing its black clothes and white hair.

Well anyways, we agreed that it was bizarre and decided to drive around and see if we could get another look. This time we happened to look at the field it was facing across the street. I don't know how we could have missed it, but what we saw were these two, quite tall, figures dressed in black trench coats a little way into the field standing about 20 yards away from each other. They too were just standing there, in this blustering cold! But the oddest part of it all was that one of them was flying a black kite. We couldn't make anything out of it.

After driving by this scene a couple times, car pulled over, trunk open, strange elderly-looking white-haired thing standing by the trunk, and two tall trench-coat donned people flying a black kite. All of this in some of the most unbearable weather that I can remember, and this is South Dakota mind you... We decided it was best to just let it be and go home, we did have a baby with us and he was getting fussy. I now wish we had gotten out, though, because I will never be able to figure out the mystery that was this situation.

So if you've read this far, does anyone have a clue of what this could have been? After reading the Mothman Prophecies by John Keel, there was a mention of the fabled men in black, and the way it was mentioned made me think of this event. In the book the Men in Black (not the Will Smith kind, but the kind they are based after, and way more creepy) are described as travelling in threes and a short, white-haired person is usually the one leading it...pretty close to what we saw that night.

Bear with me if you have the time to spare.	

   I was always that kid in school who read books instead of socializing and doing my work, so when I had to find a job to make ends meet while getting my first degree, the natural place to look was one of the university libraries. In retrospect, it seems like all of my friends who had jobs at the time worked for the university through the ""career center"". We all lived in dorms and it was the most convenient way to work and study without overextending yourself. Your commute was always limited to a building on campus, so you had a good chance of finding a job near the buildings where your classes were held. 

   I was lucky enough to get such a job. As a second semester pre-med student, I spent a good bit of my time in the chemistry and biology departments, so I worked in the chem library. It was a small library, with just enough shelf space to hold the scientific journals and periodicals we kept, twelve or so windows computers, and five wooden tables that looked like they were salvaged from the seventies. 
   
   It was pretty much the ideal job for someone who had to study organic chemistry all day. In fact, my semester went really well, academically. The only catch was what happened at the end of the semester.

   About three weeks before finals, the librarian asked me if I could fill in at another one of the school's libraries. People who work in libraries are by definition pretty reliable workers, but this particular library, at the nearby ""University of Maryland University College"" (how redundant) was short on staff because it employed a number of grad students who were running out of time to finish their thesis papers, or something like that. 

   It was a hike from my dorm to the other library, but I agreed to do it because I could use the extra hours, and it would be nice to have more time to study for finals. So I was working at two libraries, completing seventeen credit-hours, and trying to lead a normal college social life, all at the same time, the latter of which was my biggest challenge. That's what I thought at the time at least.

   It is worth noting a couple of things about this place:

   This library was older, so there were considerably more books, volumes of medical texts, and REALLY old journals. It is unlike academics and archivists to get rid of anything, so the shelves were filled with these huge green and red hardcover books that looked as though no one had cracked them recently. 

   Everything was furnished for the eighties, because this library wasn't the most popular, and didn't get much love whenever the school found a little bit of slack in their budget. There was cheap blue carpet on every floor and uninviting gray painted steel shelves contributing to the dusty smell in the place, almost as much as the ancient anatomy and psychology books.

   The medical volumes were all kept in four basement floors of ""stacks""; 3 long hallways divided the shelves. There was one hall along each wall, and one that cut through the center of the floor and connected to the stairwell. Combine this with the fact that the building maintenance people had an environmental streak a year before, deciding that all of the flickery fluorescent lights should be rigged to turn on with motion sensors, and you get a pretty eerie place.

   Unlike in the chem library, people actually checked out books, so I had to reshelve a few books everyday. Don't ask me why some kids were using these books as sources in their papers. 

   You may be detecting that I was a little scornful of the place. It wasn't really the study haven I had hoped for, despite the lack of traffic (it was almost abandoned). I didn't know it at the time; I only wanted asylum from the Nirvana that my two roommates insisted on playing during designated quiet hours in our triple. 

   So I spent most of my time reading at the main desk, usually with another librarian working nearby. Two people were scheduled to work at a time, in case one of us had to help find a book, the other could cover the desk.

   One day I was reshelving books in the stacks when I dropped one, and it fell open to the back cover page after tumbling a bit. I picked it up and almost closed it before I did a double take. On the little sleeve in the back, where people wrote their names upon checking the book out, there was a  dark brown spot about a centimeter in diameter. I may have just been a paranoid kid looking at a coffee stain, but my imagination got the better of me. It looked like it could have been blood. I looked at the checkout card. Scanning it, I saw that most people wrote their first and last name. There were about eight names there, one was 'Jesus Christ'. The last name on the card was simply 'Charlie'. I had no idea how old the spot was; the book had yellowing pages and a cracking spine, so it could have been from ages ago. I couldn't implicate whoever Charlie was for ruining this book.

   On two non-consecutive days and always at the same time, I noticed (there wasn't much else to pay attention to in the place) this guy who came in to look at the stacks for a while, check out a book, and leave. There wasn't anything remarkable that I can remember about him. He looked like the kind of guy you might see in the physics building. Like the kids with unkempt long curly hair, sweatpants, and a t-shirt that looks like it has been worn for too long without being washed. Pretty soon traffic in the library slowed down even more, and it was only the books that he checked out that I had to return to the shelves. 

   I began to take an interest in this guy, just as a train wreck case, and I wanted to know what his research was about. I looked at the books he was checking out. They were gems. All of them were at least 50 years old. Some were encyclopedic, so he could have been studying any article, but others were more specific, like about circulation and surgical techniques.

   He went through about five books over the course of a week. Some days he wouldn't show, but on the days when he returned from a hiatus, he appeared particularly hurried (and nervous?). 

   About a week before finals, I was eagerly reshelving his latest book. I studied it as I left the staircase to the second basement floor stacks. At first I couldn't really comprehend what I was looking at. This book read like a manual for amputations. The grainy pictures it contained are what really struck me. It looked like the techniques it described could not be safe by modern standards. There was no note in the text about properly sterilizing tools or any sort of antibiotics. I checked the date: published in 1913. 

   I had reached the spot where the book was kept and stood there for a minute looking at this anomaly, when I was roused by a sound. It was someone walking, but it didn't come from the central aisle. It came from the aisle closest to the wall. Another strange thing was that the walker wasn't coming from the direction of the stairway, which was the only way to reach that floor. They were coming from the far wall of the floor. After what felt like 2 minutes, the source of the footsteps revealed itself. It was the student who had checked out the book I was reshelving. He walked toward me and stood literally a foot away from me. I was about to melt from apprehension, when he turned, still seeming not to notice me and began to examine the books on the shelf near me. I slunk away and nearly flew up the stairs. 

   When I was able to gather myself, I realized that when I had left the stairwell and started examining the book, I had to wait for the motion sensors to pick me up and turn the lights on. That means that the strange student had either snuck all the way around all of the stacks in order to approach me from that direction (unlikely) or he had already been on the second basement floor when I arrived (even less likely). Needless to say, I spent very little time at the medical library after that. 

   After finals were over, I was celebrating in a friend's dorm room when, out of boredom, I glanced through the school newspaper that she had in her recycling bin. It was a few weeks old. On page 4 there was a report about a missing person. His name was Charles Emerson.",nosleep,jwhite927,/r/nosleep/comments/emmid/in_the_stacks/

24,Guardian Spirit - not scary but weird,1292463186,"A few years ago I was laying on the couch at my mom's boyfriend's house watching TV.  I had been reading ""Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark"" for most of the afternoon and evening and I was sufficiently uneasy and nervous due to being alone with large windows.  The only light in the room came from the dining room and the television.  

I heard a shuffling coming from the hallway and thought it might be the dog, a black lab.  I either turned off or muted the tv, I can't remember which.  Suddenly, the room dimmed and the colors became muted, the room was slightly gray.  A large, silver/white wolf-dog appeared in the hallway.  She (the wolf-dog) and I stared at each other for what seemed like a minute or two.  She looked at the ground and disappeared.  The light and color came back to the room.

I spoke to my mom's friend, a psychic, about this and she told me it sounded like my spirit guide/guardian spirit.  I was more than happy to accept that explanation, and am even more so now due to a few more experiences I've had with her.

A couple years ago I had a job at a floral shop about a mile away from my house.  I often got put on the last shift and when I left around 9 PM it would be sufficiently dark since it was fall/winter.  One night I was walking home, something I didn't do very often.  I was maybe 1/3 of the way home when I felt a strong tap on my shoulder.  I looked around and saw nothing.  I kept walking but said out loud ""If that was you tap my shoulder again,"" (or something like that.)  As I began to say the word ""again"" I felt another, lighter tap on my shoulder.  This time I said something along the lines of ""I know you're there, please leave me alone, I'm just going home.""

It was then that I felt a comforting presence at my side.  The unease from the taps went away and I felt at peace again.  This feeling stayed with me until I was almost at my house once more.  What's more, as I was walking I would often feel the sensation of a large animal bumping against my side, usually if I got close to the road (despite living in a rural area and no cars being on the road). A few times it switched sides and each time it did I felt myself being pushed aside to make room.  It was the same sense of peace I got from first seeing the wolf-dog a year or two earlier.

Just a few nights ago I awoke in the middle of the night, something I've been doing a lot of lately since I'm sick.  As it's finals week I've been spending a lot of time unwinding by reading Reddit and /r/nosleep is one of my new favorites.  For some reason I was extremely nervous and kept imagining pictures that have been on here recently - from The Crawler in the 'childhood boogeyman' thread to the 'a hunter got this picture while looking for deer'.  I was having trouble falling back asleep when suddenly I felt that same presence again.  I calmed down substantially and had the urge to rub my hand in a petting motion across a certain spot on my bed.  I 'petted' the spot and the calmness only grew stronger.

I've also seen the wolf-dog in a dream in which I was in substantial danger.  It's still amazing to me.

EDIT: She came back earlier tonight too.  I'm feeling slightly off, not nervous or scared of anything in particular, just depressed I guess is the best way to put it.  I was walking across campus and suddenly felt the urge to pet the air beside me.  I did but the feeling then switched to my other side and I got a little weirded out as she usually stays in one spot.  Sometimes I wonder if these times when she's invisible are really her, or if it's something pretending to be her...",nosleep,axel_val,/r/nosleep/comments/emjsf/guardian_spirit_not_scary_but_weird/

Anyway, here's my story and I swear it's all true.  A couple of years ago I was watching TV waiting for my wife to call me and ask me why I was missing marriage counseling (I had a horrible headache which isn't uncommon for me).  I was midway through a show when the tv started to flash on and off.  I looked down at the cable box and saw that the time wasn't displaying there anymore.  It was outputting gibberish and my headache was getting much worse the more the tv flashed.

I walked outside and experienced one of the strangest sensations of my adult life.  Everything was silent.  I could hear my feet on the sidewalk but there was no wind, no birds singing, no neighborhood kids screaming and running up and down the street and no sounds from the major street that runs right along my street.  It was like everything else in the world had vanished for a short time.  I walked back into my house and sat on the couch and tried to make a phone call.  The signal on my phone would show full bars and then drop all signal four seconds later.

Then, all at once, the tv clicked back on, the cable unscrambled and I heard people outside again.  I went along my day and waited for my wife to call.  She didn't, not that day at least.  She showed up, livid that I'd missed the appointment and that I had been sending her straight to voicemail after some really weird beeps and clicks.  My phone never worked again after that day.  It would hold signal for about 30 seconds at a time and then drop it.  I ended up having to get a new phone.  The phone wasn't the only fatality that day.  My corn snake (who I'd had for years) had chosen that day to commit snake suicide.  I walked in to make sure that he had water and he'd rammed his head into the glass of his tank until he died.  There was a smear of blood on the glass right above where he finally died.  I lost a really good pet (if you can call a snake a pet) that day.

I will never forget the feeling of otherness that went with the experience.  It felt like I'd been bubbled off from the rest of the world for just a few minutes and it felt really really wrong.

33,"The White Robed thing, My first experience beyond rational explanation.",1292417747,"This story takes place in the mid 90s, I must have been seven or eight at the time.  I know it was in late October.  My older brother's bedroom had these two large windows that faced they started only a few inches off the ground and reached almost to the ceiling.  Anyway, we were sitting on the floor of his bedroom, talking about something.  Exactly what, I don't remember, except that it had something to do with masks.

Quite suddenly, I notice something walk across the front yard.  I say something, because I am quite sure now, as sure as I was then, that it probably wasn't a person.  Though we had floodlights, this things glowed, not like something illuminated by floodlights, but like some kind of light, itself.  As soon as it passed out of view, I ran out into the front yard to look where it had gone.  Nothing was there.

In the direction that it had come from, however, my parents were talking to a neighbor of ours.  I tried to get my parents attention, but they insisted I wait until they were finished.  I waited.  and while waiting I noticed how quiet it was outside.  Perhaps it was always this quiet in our neighborhood, or perhaps it was unusually quiet.  I wouldn't know, I didn't make it a habit to walk around at night.  Still, the quietness seemed noteworthy.

I got my mom to walk across the front yard, walking where I had seen the thing walk.  To my astonishment she was at least a full head shorter than the thing was, and not nearly as bright.  This revealed to me, as well, that the thing had appeared to have been robed, and had been very indistinct, or blurry.  I have not seen it since.

34,Weird things that have happened in my life. ,1292412500,"Sorry in advance if this turns out to be lengthy. I'm not entirely sure where to post this, but this place seems like a good start. 

All of my life I've sort of felt like I could ""feel"" things. Unnatural things. It varies; sometimes I feel like ""something"" is there that I can't see; other times I've had very odd premonitions. I also sometimes have extremely vivid dreams.  

Premonitions: They are usually mundane and ordinary- for example, a few years ago, I was going to deposit my paycheck at an outside ATM at my bank (was after 5 and bank was closed). As I got out of my car, I had a sudden vision in my head of opening the metal box that contains the deposit envelopes, and seeing that it was empty. When I got up to the ATM machine, I opened the box to get an envelope, and it was indeed empty. These kinds of occurrences don't happen often, but they do occur. 

""Feeling"" a presence: In my last apartment, I lived by myself. It should be noted that I had gotten out of an abusive relationship and was pretty emotionally messed up, so this probably affected my judgment in some way. Anyway. My apartment was small- when you walked in, the living room and dining room were right there, and then the kitchen, and a hallway. Attached to the left side of the hallway was my bedroom. At the end of the hallway was a closet with a stackable washer and dryer in it, and to the right of that was the bathroom. 

At night, whenever I went to the bathroom, I got a very cold feeling when walking by the closet with the washer and dryer. If I stood in that little area between the bathroom and the closet, it felt like someone else was there. It got to the point where I was literally afraid to go down the hallway without the hallway light on. It chilled my soul, so to speak. 

The creepiest night there was when I went to the bathroom and discovered that the toilet seat was up, like a man had just used it and forgotten to put it back down. No one but me had been at my apartment all day. I didn't sleep the entire night, nor did I turn any of the lights off in my apartment. 

Dreams: The past year or so my dreams have been particularly dark. They all seem to have a recurring theme- someone is trying to get me. The dreams themselves are always different. 

Dream 1: I dreamt that I was at a party in what appeared to be a large mansion with several floors. I was on the top floor. This thing that looked like a witch was in front of me and told me she was going to control me. Somehow she entered my body and I no longer had control over my actions. She forced me to go around killing various people at this party. Every time I went down a floor, I had to kill more people. Finally I got tired of this. Somehow I managed to get back under my own control and forced her out of my body/mind. She was pissed. She screamed at me that she was going to kill me, that she would haunt my dreams until she had taken my soul. Then she proceeded to possess another party goer, who promptly started to come towards me with a knife in his hand. That was when I woke up. 

Dream 2: In this dream, I, along with several other people, was kidnapped by an old lady. She looked like the pigeon lady from Home Alone 2 if you remember her. Anyway, apparently this lady had lost her entire family and gone bat shit crazy, and had kidnapped us to make us into her new family or something. She had an assistant, a girl of about 20 or so who was very pretty, but seemed very evil. We were all sitting around the table one evening having dinner. A man who had been kidnapped was reading Sports Illustrated at the table, and the old woman got upset that he was reading instead of interacting with her. She ordered her assistant to kill him. The evil assistant girl walked over to him, stuck her hand with a knife down his throat, and cut his heart out from the inside (yes, I know this obviously isn't possible, but hey it was a dream). I remember feeling absolutely terrified in my dream and deciding that it was time to leave. For some reason, even though she had kidnapped us, there was physically nothing to prevent us from leaving. I ran out the front door of the house, and my dream ended with the old lady and evil girl running after me, laughing maniacally at me and saying there was no way out. 

Dream 3: This was very recent, just a few nights ago. 
The first part of my dream was not about me, but rather about a little girl of maybe 10 or so. A group of Asian men who appeared to be military personnel lured this girl into what looked like some sort of military base. The girl was subsequently forced to be a slave- nothing icky, like sex or anything, just forced to work and work endlessly and never being allowed to go. The next part of my dream was about me- suddenly I was in this military base and these guys were trying to convince me to stay and ""party"" with them. Having seen what happened to the little girl, I knew what their ulterior motives were, and that I had to escape somehow. The worst part of my dream- at some point I was left alone with just one guy. I guess I saw that as my opportunity for escape, so I got into a physical fight with him that ended up with him on the ground, on his back, and me straddling him, holding him down. I grabbed a plastic bag and put it over his head, intent on killing him. I suffocated him several times but every time I thought he was dead, he would wake up and I would have to suffocate him again. My dream ended like this, just me going crazy trying to kill this guy, and when I woke up I felt terrified. 


I am not sure what all of this means. I was raised in a very conservative, Christian home and so growing up I had no problem believing in all of the things that I felt. Since becoming an adult, I have gradually etched out my own belief system, and I don't believe in God and all of that religious stuff anymore. But ghosts, premonitions, basically ""supernatural"" things- I don't want to believe this stuff, but the difference between this and religion is that I can really feel this stuff in some sort of deep, indescribable way. But then it makes me wonder- if these things that I feel and think are possible, then isn't anything possible? How can I believe in one thing and not the other? I'm so confused, ha ha. 

Also, unrelated, but scared the crap out of me when I was a kid: When I was 10 my mom married this guy who turned out to be a con artist. When everything fell apart very suddenly and unexpectedly three years later, my mom had a lot of trouble dealing with it. She woke me up in the middle of the night one night to tell me that she'd just seen a demon and asked me to pray with her. She said that she'd been in bed and suddenly there was a wolf on top of her, growling at her just inches away from her face, and that it had red eyes and she could feel the weight of it on her chest. 

Scared the ever living shit out of me because of course, back then, I believed in demons and angels and all things religious. 

Of course now when I think about it I wonder what type of mom would do that to their kid, but my mom is generally a good and level headed person, so I know she must have genuinely felt in fear of her life to put that sort of burden on me at that age.

35,The Grey Lady,1292394955,"Have you guys ever heard of the Grey Lady? I remember hearing some campfire stories about her when I was a kid, but I haven't been able to find much about her. Here's what I remember: Supposedly people see her in remote places, mountain tops, deep forests, out in the country. She appears to be an old, very tall, thin woman. And she wears this long grey dress. People report seeing her during times great physical duress, usually when the witness believes themselves to be close to death and almost exclusively when the witness is alone in the situation. They say she always has this big smile.


I found this story online a few years ago about a hiker who got lost in British Columbia and saw her. Everything is true here, but I kind of hope this isn't:


I'd already been out there for about four days, doing some off trail hiking, and I had a great time, I used to love going out in the woods by myself, I liked the solitude. I must have gotten turned around, I didn't end up back where I wanted to be at what was supposed to be the end of my trip. I later found out that I had been going in the almost complete opposite direction of my car. 


It was about three days after I was supposed to be home, I was just trying to get out of there, when started with seeing things. Just on the edge of my vision, shadows. I'd look, but then there'd be nothing there. At night, I would hear noises outside my tent, at first I thought it was just animals, and I'm sure some of the sounds were, but others...I heard scratching, and sometimes late at night, I'd wake up and hear  breathing, not like any animal, I'd call out, thinking maybe someone was there, but I'd never get an answer.


This went on for a few days, I thought maybe it was just the woods getting to me. You hear horror stories about hunters who get lost and start hallucinating, or who die of thirst with water in their packs. The forest can mess with you. But about a week after I got lost, I saw her off in the distance, maybe 200 ft. away, hands at her sides, and she was tall. Six or seven feet, with her head craned downward, like she was deformed or something. But she was still looking at me. She wore this dirty dress, that hung down to the ground. 

I called out but she didn't do or say anything. I started running towards her. I was scared, but by then I was worried that I wasn't going to make it out of those woods.  I got within maybe 100 ft, But she stepped behind a tree, and when I got up there, I was just alone, I don't know where she could have gone. 


The next couple days I didn't see anything, and the nights were quiet. I just kept following this creek, hoping I'd find something, anything. I ran out of food on the tenth day, and that night I woke up, not sure what time it was, to this laughing from outside, a low giggling, it lasted for a few seconds. Had I dreamt it? I opened the flap of my tent and called out, but all I could hear was the sound of running water, which was strange, there should have been bugs, deer, wind, something, but it was just so quiet. 

Then a loud snap from about twenty feet away, I shined my flashlight and I saw her there, half hidden, poking out from behind a tree, grinning at me. I got a better look at her than before. She was old, her hair done up in a bun. And her face was...distorted. Her nose was too long, crooked. Her eyes were too close together, too big. Black. We stared at each other for a long time, and when I called out to her her grin just got wider. I just sat there frozen looking at her. I yelled again, I asked her what she wanted. And she just laughed, this scratchy, painful laugh. Then, she stepped out of the light and I couldn't find her again. 


The rest of the night, I heard...things outside. Even the constant bubbling of the creek scared me. I wanted out, I was hungry, exhausted, and scared for my life. I truly believed that I was going to die in those woods. At first light I set out, walking as fast as I could away from my campsite. Sometime in the late afternoon, I came across an old logging road. It didn't look like it had been used in years, and I knew that it didn't mean that I was safe yet, but still, seeing that sign of humanity, it was happiest moment of life. 

It was getting dark and I felt like I was going to pass out, but I didn't want to stop, I don't think that I could have slept anyway. Somehow I found the energy to keep going. About two hours after I started following the road, it was pitch black out, and it started to rain. I'd been lucky enough to have good enough weather for my trip, but within a few minutes it was pouring. I was plodding along as fast as I could, when I heard the footsteps behind me. I'd stop and listen, and they would stop too. I'd start walking and I'd hear them again. A few times I thought that I could see her, stopped not too far behind me. And more than once I heard her laughing, that disgusting laugh. 


It was almost dawn when I came to the top of a hill and saw lights. Lights! Mankind, civilization. I practically fell down the hill, stumbling to the door of the small house, I must have looked like some kind of monster, dirty, wet, exhausted, but they took me in, it was an old couple, they gave me some food and a bed to sleep in. I woke up and they told me that I slept for 15 hours. I told them about the woman I saw, and nice as they were, I could tell that I was making them uncomfortable. They told me it was just the hunger, but I know what I saw. Out there, deep in the woods. And I'll never forget the laughing.

The TV show ran in my country in the early 2000s, I think it was 2000-2003. I don't live in a western country, though, so it was probably an older TV series from the 90s.

The show always start with a host, I think it was a muscular/tall man wearing a suit or black shirt. Each episode has two or three shorts. I remember the ""background"" for the host or the montage is a closeup shot of human eye.

There are 2 memorable shorts from the show:

* The first is about a group of teenager who had an accident. The car they were driving drowned in a lake and no one knows about their death. Because of this, they are able to return to the world of the living as if nothing happened. They go on their daily lives, meet their friends, etc. I don't remember what happens then, I think something bad starts to happen and to end it, they make their deaths known. Their car gets taken out of the lake and they disappear.

* Another story is about a house which lights must never be turned off. A man lives there and somehow gets some of the lights off and ends up attacked by a monster/ghost.

Back, oh i dont know, about 5 years ago, i was at work and decided to take my lunch break a little later than usual as to avoid the ""lunch crowd"". Usually I would bring my lunch, but it was a gorgeous day outside, so i decided to grab a bite to eat somewhere nearby. Since I worked in retail, they usually have people go 1 at a time (cant have too many people gone from the registers at once), so i went to lunch alone. Anyway, i decide to go to this place around my work, grab a taco, and sit down and enjoy my meal. Not a lot of people were out eating, so I kind of took a moment to ""people watch"" at the other eating around me. What I saw, i couldnt believe, and still creeps me out to this day when i think about it. Across  from me, probably no more than 20 feet away, was a guy who looked exactly like me. I dont mean a little like me, but EXACTLY like me. Just sitting there eating. My jaw dropped. THe more I looked at him, the more I realized that this guy is my twin. I was sitting there staring at him for about two minutes completely baffled, and then, he starts looking at me. We kind of give each other this ""WTF"" look.

2 years ago or so my buddy and I went out to Lovells Island for a night of exploration and camping. At that time we were both really into old/strange places and would spend most of our time traveling throughout New England to explore places with old cellar holes, abandoned villages, etc. Despite Lovells Island not being our typical M.O. (we enjoyed places that were at least 2 hundred years old) we were psyched! 
	
*Lovells Island is an island in the Boston harbor that’s loaded with WW1 and WW2 relics. 

Anyways, we got there early and spent the day exploring. Most of the day the island seemed packed with fellow explorers; mostly fathers and sons, and boy scout troops. This place was amazing! Everything from huge concrete forts to secret paths, it was our best exploration at that point.  
	
We decided that we wanted to set up camp in a place we thought no one had ever set up camp before, which I might note is against the islands rules. After about 4 hours of walking around we found a path behind the old medical facility which lead to some sort of water well with a ladder. We walked down the decrepit, almost completely rotten ladder and followed the underground tunnel for about 200 yards. At the end, to our surprise, was an opening to a part of the beach which was not on the free island maps. This beach was beautiful and the coolest part was once we walked out of the tunnel, there was a large archway which seemed to be made of concrete. Past the archway was a building which was half in the water and have on the beach. We put together that after years and years the foundation of the building gave out and it began to move slowly toward the water. Anyways, we didn’t see anyone on this beach, no footsteps or anything (there are tons of footsteps throughout the beaches due to the visitors). I also noticed that we must have been on the farthest away part of the island because it was only ocean past the beach. We spent a few hours here and decided it was time to find a campsite and we figured why not set up shop right on this beach. 
	
We sure did, and it was a mistake. I woke up in the middle of the night to take a piss, I opened the tent and there were literally at least 1,000 rabbits surrounding our tent just looking at me. I thought it was kind of cool and woke up my buddy. We tried to scare them away but they just sat there and stared. Anyways, after about 15 minutes of trying to freak the bunnies out, we retired to bed again. 
	
I woke up again to my buddy taping me on the shoulders, he told me could hear a little girl crying. I listened and listened but couldn’t hear anything and eventually fell back asleep. 
At about dawn, we both woke up at the same time, gasping for air. This time I could hear the crying and it seemed like it was right outside our tent. We were literally frozen in fear. I remember being so horrified, differently than I have ever been, to the point where I almost blacked out. It was a strange, life changing experience. We both heard it, we both couldn’t move. We could hear all the rabbits run away at one point during the crying and at that point the crying stopped and for a brief moment all was silent. 

Then we heard a loud scream, I mean this scream was something different, picture a typical horror movie demon scream mixed with a fox howl. This scream was coming from the exact place we were hearing the crying. (Side note; we have discussed this numerous times and it definitely was not an animal whimper or cry) 
Moving on, the scream stopped and we waited there until the sun was fully up. We quickly packed up, never looking at where the noises were coming from and left. 

Last summer we went back. We couldn’t find the well, nor the path. We even asked on of the guides and he had no idea. No recollection of any building on any of the beaches. 
I can’t sleep, haven’t been able to. Same with my friend.

51,Creepy Text Message,1292284684,"I have a large extended family that all gets along well and loves spending time together. Not too long ago, one of my aunts passed away from a terminal illness. Her name was Laura, and the illness had caused her to be unable to speak. Since she couldn't speak, many of us kept in contact with her by text messaging. She was especially close to another of my aunts, Susan. 

When she passed away, it was a very emotional time for my family. We knew it had been coming, but Laura was so loving and so important to all of us. Her funeral was around 5 days after she had passed away, and everyone that could was planning on attending. After the funeral we would all go back to Laura and her husband's house for a meal together and to remember her. My family is known for laughing together even when things are difficult.

My aunt Susan received a text message on her phone on the day of the funeral. It said ""Are you guys having fun without me?"" Susan didn't really text with anyone, and didn't recognize the number so she sent replied with ""Who is this?""

The message she got back nearly gave her a heart attack. It said ""This is Laura - did you forget me already?""",nosleep,samurailynn,/r/nosleep/comments/elaz6/creepy_text_message/

54,"Strange Happenings in Empire, MI",1292229242,"Well, I will try and make this brief, but the story starts with me and my girlfriend going camping this summer.

On a whim I took about a week off of work this summer, grabbed my girlfriend and headed North. I really had no plans of where to go, and packed nothing (seriously, I really should have packed, but ended up raiding the Wal-mart). The first two nights were great, my girlfriend had never went camping before but handled it great.

The third night though, it got wierd. It took us about 3 hours to find the Empire campground, and once we did we realized that NO ONE ELSE was there. Strange, but it seemed to be a positive for us (we didn't have to worry about waking up the neighbors). When we went into the main office, we were greeted by a middle-aged man that screamed creepy (we didn't think anything at the time). He explained to us that if we needed anything to just come down to the main office and ask, that he was leaving at about 10 o'clock. He then proceeded to assign us the most remote campsite in the entire area.

After we got settled at our campsite we went into town and grabbed a bite to eat at the bar, walked around the town and returned. When we got back to our campsite, something didn't seem right though. You know that feeling when you can tell someone has been in your stuff? Yeah, it was that feeling. I brushed it off again though, because no one else was in the entire campground.

We made a fire and enjoyed each others company until about midnight when we decided to call it a night. As soon as we got into the tent, my girlfriend kept saying that she heard weird noises. Now I grew up in the woods and have had a farm my whole life, so naturally I assured her that there were many animals in the forest, and they all make noise.

Then came my tipping point. After about 20 minutes in the tent I hear the distinct sounds of my car handles being ""popped"" (when you try to open the door, but its locked). That really freaked me out, but of course, I said nothing in order to remain masculine (haha, yea right). About 2 or 3 minutes after I heard my car door handles I started to hear breathing. The only animal I knew of to breathe that heavy was a deer, and I know what deer sound like.

I was really freaking out at this point and was trying to devise a strategy to defend my girlfriend and I should an intruder come into the tent, but I could think of nothing. I sat in silence for about 5 minutes (all the while very strange, human like noises are still coming from outside) then decided to say something to my girlfriend.

I told her I heard the noises too, which thoroughly freaked her out, and then in the back of my head I remembered by main frustration with horror movies; that the main characters never leave when things get creepy. After that thought, we were packed and in the car within 5 minutes. Where it gets weirder though is the creepy guy's car was at the main office, the main offices lights were on, but he was no where to be found.

To this day I am skeptical whether or not we actually were in physical danger, but that had to have been one of the creepiest things I have ever experienced.",nosleep,MMMpatient,/r/nosleep/comments/ekx2n/strange_happenings_in_empire_mi/
55,"Shadows around me, anyone else see these things?",1292222895,"Please forgive me if this seems disjointed, but I've lurked here for a few days and it seems like the kind of thing you'd be interested in, if only I can remember it all properly.

I once lived in a small country town, in a flat above one of the local stores. Not long after moving in (I was roughly 8 or 9 years old at the time) I remember feeling uncomfortable at night, in particular down the hallway which led to the only exit down a flight of stairs. Only once in the few years I lived there did I actually see anything down that hallway. It was a shadow of a man, standing perfectly still, leaning ever so slightly on a cane and wearing a 19th century bowler hat. He did nothing, but I knew he was the one that caused me to feel so on edge.

Although that was the only time I saw him there, I continued to feel uneasy until we moved out of there. My family moved into a small house further out of town, on a farm, and the feelings disappeared, I completely forgot about them until I moved out of home at 16.

A friend of mine took me in and we got along great, her mother was more than accepting of me and encouraged me to do whatever I needed to succeed. After about a month of moving in I was walking out of the bathroom one night and I saw a small black shadow, no taller than a cat, run out of the kitchen, and stopped in full view for a split second before turning and bolting down the hallway. It's speed surpassed anything I've seen before of a creature that size and the way it almost seemed to glide convinced me enough that it wasn't anything physical.

Anyway, as far as I know the only reason it stopped is because I stopped as I was walking out, it **knew** that I saw it, and it was just as surprised as I was. Although it had no visible eyes it was definitely watching me. These sort of sighting became an increasingly common occurrence, I'll only go into more detail if someone asks as I feel this is already becoming a bit tl;dr, but there was more than one of them, and they began playing with me, testing my reactions, I should have never let them know I could see them.

The man came back only once, while I was in this same house. He stood at the end of the hall again, this time right in the way of the front door. Thankfully this house was only single storey and there was more than one exit, but I know for sure that he is following me now.

As for those smaller... *things*... I see them everywhere now, although not as often. I'm not sure if they've always been everywhere, or if they're just following me, but I do know that I've grown accustomed to them, and I have a feeling they've grown rather attached to me. I don't feel as threatened any more though, almost as if they enjoy having someone who can see them, and try to guide me along the right path. I don't want to say they'd protect me, but I get the impression sometimes.

sorry for tl;dr, if you want any more info just ask me in the comments, I'm more than happy to answer most questions you have. (I may choose not to answer some personal questions if there are any)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: Wow, I'm surprised this is getting the interest that it is, you guys want some more info/stuff that's happened, so here it is.

So after the first sighting of the smaller thing (from here on in I'll call them imps, although they're like no imps I've ever seen depicted before) I talked to the friend I was living with about them as she was into this sort of thing (from here on in known as Tracy for simplifying this, obviously not her real name). We started looking things up and there have been numerous accounts of similar beings, but nothing that I could honestly say for sure were these exact things.

I'll try to describe them as best as I can. They're no taller than a foot from the ground, and have no discernible features other than what appear to be legs, but they move far too fast for these to actually be used. Although they apparently have no eyes, they can without doubt see, at the very least, basic surroundings and living creatures (I've actually seen one pass straight through wire mesh before, so whether it saw it and didn't care or didn't see it because it didn't affect it, I'll never know). They don't fear light, they appear at any time of day (although in the afternoon is the only time I've seen more than one at a time) but what disturbed me the most when I first saw it was the aura about it.

These imps look as though they've been submersed in darkness beyond anything we could fathom for centuries, to the point where it's so thick and impenetrable that no amount of light could possibly pierce it. It seems heavy and viscous, almost dripping straight off of them so long as they're not moving. As they move it whips around them, engulfing them in what can only be described as flames (although it doesn't act quite the same, it's the closest comparison). I hope I find someone here who's seen these so we can figure out a proper description, but from the research done I doubt this will happen.

My most recent encounter with anything larger than these (the imps are more common and tend not to bother me too much) was just a few months ago. Just outside of the study is the lounge, and I frequently leave the t.v on with the Xbox running (I chat on live to my friends while I'm on the pc, it's cheaper than a phone call). One night I was on here, jumping between sites trying to find something to do and I heard the menu flick through on the Xbox. I was a little bit freaked out as I was certain that I hadn't accidentally knocked the controller, but didn't bother giving it a second thought other than to move the controller away from me. about 2 minutes later the menu began to flick through again (those of you who own an Xbox will know the clicking sort of noise it makes when you move up or down) but this time it just kept doing it and I was alone in the house, it definitely wasn't me and the only other controller was out in the lounge room.

Later that night I went to bed and just as I was about to fall asleep I felt *something* at the foot of my bed. It wasn't the imps, and I'm 90% sure it wasn't the man in the bowler hat. It wanted me to acknowledge it was there, like it wanted to do something to me, and knew I knew it was there, but until I turned to look at it or spoke to it it couldn't. Needless to stay I slowed my breathing almost to the point where I wasn't breathing at all, and remained perfectly still. I wasn't going to risk anything. After trying for a while I finally fell asleep.

I'm not sure how long it stayed there after that, but it wasn't there in the morning.

57,Brushy Fork,1292212326,"Just learned about r/nosleep this week, very interesting reads.  Guess I can make my contribution as well.

This is two stories in one, first the back ground then the personal experience.  

So back in the mid 1800's there was a lady by the name of Annie Moats who lived in West Virginia, her family lived across the Appalachian Mt. range in Virginia.  Story has it that Annie Moats would always be beaten by her husband in WV so one day she got fed up with it and decided she was going to walk across the mountain to seek refuge with her family in VA, this is not a short hike, this is 30 plus miles over a huge mountain.  As she neared the top of the mountain on that night she was met by a huge snow storm and froze to death.  Her body was not found until the proceeding spring by hunters and now there is a stone marking the place she was found on the mountain.  

Ive heard countless stories of bear hunters lost in the wood and they spot a lantern off in the hollow and it will lead them back to their truck.  Many say its the ghost of Annie Moats trying to help those lost on Brushy Fork, the mountain where she froze to death.  

Heres where my story begins.  I was with my mother and little sister enjoying a nice jeep ride through the mountain one night looking for deer and enjoying the view.  We drive off the back side of the VA side and down into WV and turn onto Brushy Fork Road, this road is mostly a fire trail, only traveled by hunters and jeepers.  Its about 8:30 well after dark and we are driving down the road slowly when a deer steps slowly out in front of my jeep.  I stop waiting for it to pass and my mom and sis enjoy the close encounter.  This is where the strangeness begins.  The deer faces my jeep and kneels down on its front legs as if its bowing towards us, it then gets up and walks off.  Very strange to say the least but we continue on.  Shortly after heading down towards a pasture I begin to smell a funny burning smell so I stop and get out.  To my surprise my brakes are on fire!  I am franticly trying to put my brakes out and I find it odd because I wasnt even using them hard.  Then from inside the jeep my sister starts screaming bloody murder saying ""get it off me get it off me""  she is physically being thrown around and trying to fight off some unseen attacker in the back seat.  It stops.  The fires go out.  I get in the jeep lock the doors and ask what is going on to my sobbing mother and sister.  She said something was scratching her and her arms were physically scratched up and red.  Needless to say we proceeded to get the fuck out of there in a hurry, but as I was turning around on the road I noticed off to the right under a big tree was the marker of Annie Moats which I had seen on a previous hike so I was aware that thats what this marker was.

The next day, everyone still shaken I took my jeep to the shop to figure out why my brakes caught on fire, the mechanic said there was no evidence that my brakes had ever caught fire and they were working just fine.  As for the other incident my mother and sister went to a psychic who said that they she was attacked by a poltergeist who inhabits Brushy Fork Mtn, whether it was Annie Moats or not I cant tell because I have always heard that she was a helpful spirit.

58,Series of Events,1292207389,"After reading /r/nosleep I figured I might as well sign up and post some of my own experiences.

Until I was about 6 or 7, whenever I happened to leave the door to my bedroom open just a crack, a man with a cowboy hat would watch me while I was playing.  It was such a common occurrence that, at the time, I thought nothing of it. He was older and would just watch me playing. Never said anything, never appeared if the door was open more than a third of the way. I never tried to talk to him, I don't really remember why. It stopped after I moved to a new state. Years later, in high school, I mentioned the man to my dad. My dad looked at me and said he had a story for me.  When my dad and his siblings were younger, the youngest brothers , R &amp; M, would see their dead father watching them from the end of their room at night. Multiple times my uncles would run out of their room to sleep with one of the other siblings because they didn't want their father's ghost watching him. I described the man to my dad, and he confirmed it as my grandpa and said he must be watching over me.

Another time when I was younger, I was left alone in my parents bedroom after they had finished doing whatever in there. I had my feet hanging off the bed and was playing with some toy. Randomly, something yanked me off of the bed. My stupid self thought it was somehow our cat, and I looked under the bed and around the room for it, but it wasn't there. I went out into the living room to see if it was a relative that had somehow done it, but they were all watching tv. To this day I won't leave my feet hanging off of the bed. I have never heard of this happening to anyone else, and the only stories I get close to of anything happening when your feet hang off the bed, are stories about Duendes.

Finally, in my freshman year of college, I participated in a summer program to start college early. I was happy to get away, because the apartment my family had just moved into gave me the creeps with things disappearing and randomly reappearing days later in the spot it had gone missing from. The summer went by really quickly and I had a couple weeks to stay with my family before starting fall courses. My older sister and I shared a room in this apartment, and slept in a bunk bed. I slept on the top bunk that night, her on the bottom. In the middle of the night I woke up randomly. The room was pretty dark, with only a small night light to cast light. I didn't know why I was awake but I looked to my left to see a shadow man staring at me in the middle of my room. I stared at him for a second, I couldn't make out any real features and was scared out of my mind. I looked away quick and closed my eyes hoping I was just imagining things. The next few times I looked back, he was still there staring. Eventually I figured if I stopped looking and went back to sleep he would go away. It was difficult, but I managed.  In the morning I made myself breakfast and was watching tv. My sister came out of the room, and said to me: ""Don't be scared, but someone was watching us while we were sleeping last night."" I had not said a word to her about it at all. From that moment I never slept in the room again and would only sleep on the couch in the living room.",nosleep,nfuentes,/r/nosleep/comments/ekrs4/series_of_events/
59,Ophthalmology,1292172803,"I'll start by saying I have a very skeptical viewpoint of the supernatural. My parents are both fiercely religious as well as superstitious (perhaps you'll say that's redundant, ha) but I'm almost always an agnostic and I don't think I believe in ghosts.

That said, I'd like to tell you about an unsettling experience of mine.

My sophomore year at university I applied and was accepted as an intern in an ophthalmology lab. The position was unpaid, 15 hrs a week, performing cell counts. It was hardly interesting work, but necessary for a premed student to get lab experience.

The lab was in a converted hospital. That sounds ominous I know, but actually the section where I spent my time was a maternity ward, so it should have been filled with happy thoughts, right? The actual work we did, however, was a little creepy. We were testing compounds to try and find a way to decrease cell death and increase cell regeneration after crush of the optic nerve. We did this by surgically crushing the nerve of adult beagles, treating them, then putting them down and harvesting the retinas. My job was to take pictures of the retina, and quite literally count the cells under a microscope.

I had an almost immediate negative predisposition to my coworkers. They were irritable, impatient, and disrespectful even towards each other. They also seemed almost bafflingly incompetent. Equipment and samples were often lost, refrigerators would be left open or unplugged spoiling compounds, even data would occasionally get deleted. In hindsight, considering the frequency of these events, I should have thought it odd that no one had proposed the possibility of a poltergeist in the lab, but that would have required a modicum of humor between us, which I can assure you there was none.

As a result of these tensions, and the fact that my work was solitary, it wasn't long before I started keeping odd hours to avoid my colleagues. I'd come in around 6:00pm and work for 8 hours, twice a week. Since I was alone I'd play a book on tape or a netflix instant movie, and the experience would be largely more pleasurable without the bickering and conflict that defined the lab's daylight hours.

At least it was at first. I can only imagine it was the movies and books that kept me unaware for so long, but a few weeks before the holiday interim I let payment on my netflix account lapse. That night while I worked in silence I experienced a few sensations that I consider to be truly unexplainable.

It started fairly early in the evening. The dogs had already been fed, and I could hear them shuffling about and occasionally yipping from the kennel. It was already dark out, and the wind was whipping like it only really does in the winter, rattling the old glass panes of the windows. I left my desk to refill a water bottle. Upon stepping into the long hallway of the wing I was immediately hit with a nervousness. At first I didn't know to what to attribute it, when it struck me I almost called the lab supervisor. First, there was not a sound in the whole lab. No vibrations of washers, no spinning centrifuges, not even the gentle hum of computers. Secondly, every single door, dozens, was unlocked, and flung wide open on its hinges.

Instead, I quickened my pace. As I walked past room after room I noticed their interiors sickeningly dark, as if they could not be penetrated by the light from the hall. As I neared the fountain even the dogs had fallen silent, the hall's only sounds my footsteps. I began filling my bottle, only to drop it, startled, as I heard from the kennel a single impossibly simultaneous bark, from each dog. Not a bark, or really a growl, it sounded wet and I don't know how else to explain it.

At this point I was scared, and I was alone, so I dropped my bottle where I stood and ran. There's something about running down a hallway, try sometime at night, the hallway stretches and the running makes you afraid.

I spent the rest of the night rigidly at my desk. I don't know if it was in my head, or reality, but I felt at the time quite certain that there was a single shadow in the room that didn't belong, flitting outside my vision. Anyone who's worked in a lab like me, or perhaps a library, knows how you can feel after hours of silence, under a flickering fluorescent light. I stood up only once, to spin around and catch it, and immediately sat back down, knocked back by the screech of the autoclave's steam relief. I swear, I almost died at that moment.

I came into the lab again the next day. No one mentioned the unlocked doors. I can only imagine tests left to run over night were re-prepared, and run again during the day. People were irritable as usual, but there was no mention of things out of the ordinary. We did have one visit, a grad student who worked further down the wing walked by the labroom I was working in, no doubt to speak with my supervising professor. When passing by the room she stopped dead in her tracks, mouth agape, and stared first past me, then looking me straight in the eyes, before continuing.

A half an hour later the fire alarm went off. Grumbling, the lab workers shuffled out, we stood in the cold, then started to funnel back into the staircase to the ophthalmology wing. Thats when I saw her again, the staring grad student. She was standing at the mouth of the stairway, scanning the crowd. Her eyes finally landed on me, and she motioned me into a side hallway. Curious, I followed.

When we had moved a sufficient distance away from the grumpy crowd to talk I gave her a smile and asked how I could help her. She seemed not to hear me, gazing over my right shoulder she asked ""Have you lost an relatives lately? An older man? Or anyone close to you?"" I responded no and she quickly followed up with ""Has anyone you know of passed away that may have a special interest in you?"" I was mostly amused, a little spooked by her questions. ""No, why?""

What she told me next was stated with such matter of fact confidence, and followed by her immediate departure, I was left accepting it on default for moments before my skeptical brain could kick in. ""There's a dead man behind you, he's a ghost. One arm outstretched he's been pointing at you all morning.""

I've never believed in psychics, although I had before this point had one odd encounter. On a elementary school field trip a chaperone had turned to a friend of mine, eyes glassy, and abruptly said ""your dog is dead"". Afterwards she denied saying this, but sure enough... The dog had been struck by a car. When it didn't come to the door when called, even into the night, he was terrified. It was found the next day by the cloud of flies, it had dragged itself under the porch and died.

After returning to the crowd of people unevacuating the building, I purposefully pushed my way in to avoid standing next to the girl I had dubbed crazy. I returned to my lab room, and sat at my computer. Behind me two grad students were fighting. The argument, over another missing sample, grew louder than average. In fact, one girl turned to the other and actually rose her voice to a shout, and at the exact moment a glass cabinet shattered, pouring beakers and cylinders to the floor. Both grads students immediately stood quietly. One whispered ""Fuck this place"" and then walked out without making any attempt at cleaning.

It was that statement that pushed me over the edge. It was as if they knew, they knew there was something completely insane about the lab, and were resigned to it. I never came back to the lab at night. I worked two more weeks, frequently peering over my shoulder, and scampering quickly past the kennel on my trips to the bathroom, and then I left. I've not had any contact with the people I left behind, and for all I know they are continuing their business.

Whether anything I experienced represents a haunting, or a disturbance, or just paranoia and crappy employees, I have no idea. I tell people I quit because my coworkers were lousy. But there's definitely more to it than that, and I wont step in that building again.",nosleep,[deleted],/r/nosleep/comments/ekjgu/ophthalmology/
60,"My collection of odd experiences, oh how I wish I were joking.",1292167195,"* First. I was lying in bed one night and I heard a light rustling. But it was just my foot-twitching so I closed my eyes again. I then awoke, in horror to my right hand, floating about 1 1/2 feet in the air. Totally still, it felt like it was being held up by a thin-hard strip, like a handcuff or bony fingers. I didn't open my eyes. But, after about 5 seconds (longest 5 seconds of my life) my hand drops, and it didn't just drop, it felt like it was pushed. I was freaked out for weeks.
* Second. I was getting gas at about 2 in the morning and as I pulled out of the gas station I saw a man in a real-estate building. He was very near to the window, and his face was very...real. He was staring at the car as I pulled out. He was very vivid, but totally forgettable looking, he was wearing a top hat. As I drove home, I was driving up a hill and past some trees when I saw a shadowy figure, again, wearing a top-hat walk in front of a few of the trees. What stood out this time was the ""realness"" of his movements. Rattled me for a few days.
* Last. A long time ago my friends and I were staying at their house. (the friends were 2 brothers.). So, anywho, we were watching a movie, no biggie. Then we go to the tent we set up in the backyard (small fenced in backyard) and go to sleep. Well, I get up a while later with the older of the two brothers and we go inside to watch tv (girls gone wild commercials lol) but when we turn the TV on it just kinda does that ""shutting off"" thing that old tvs do where they shrink to a dot first. But the TV was already off so it was especially odd. There was that white dot in the middle of the screen for about 5 seconds, it flashed once, looking like it BLINKED, stayed for 2 or 3 more seconds, then disappeared. I remember waking up right after that, in the tent. Scared shitless about the dream I just had with the blinking TV screen. At breakfast that morning I tell the younger brother what happened, and he/we kinda laugh it off. He calls me later and tells me with a cracking voice that his brother told him that he had a dream that was exactly the same. I never went over to their house again, but we remained friends.",nosleep,OddCrow,/r/nosleep/comments/ekiew/my_collection_of_odd_experiences_oh_how_i_wish_i/

67,Scary Dream I Had Recently:,1292119898,"Recently, I've been having odd dreams that involve someone trying to take me away, or me following a group of people to some unknown destination. Here's some quick background on my dreams:

I know there's a lot of talk about Slenderman and whatnot, but ever since I was a child, I would have a reoccurring nightmare about a man with a hat who could stretch his body and would watch me from the window. He always walked past my window (We lived on the 4th floor in an apartment) and when he'd feel my stare, he would turn to face me with a hateful and livid expression.

That said, he disappeared one night after I spent about a month of staying in my parents' room (haha). 

In recent months, I had a dream with three figures in black. They chose one who then tried to lead me away to ""die."" I remember my mother's voice calling out, begging for him to let me go. I kept breaking free from his loose grasp and I begged for my life. He eventually let go of my hand and told me never to follow. He said: ""I followed and now I'm here.""

It always freaked me out, since I've had similar dreams before. Never with the hatted people, though. 

I've had other dreams with people leading me away. But two weeks ago, I had a dream where I entered a train on the subway. It was a regular 7 train (I'm from NY), and when I stepped on, I felt apprehensive and nervous. There were only about 6 people on it and I knew all of them. Three girls, three guys. Some were good friends of mine and the rest were acquaintances. 

I just sat by myself and kept quiet. The ride was taking forever and I got more and more nervous as time passed by. Eventually, the other passengers started talking to me. Sam seemed like she was the center of everyone. It's hard to explain but it seemed like she knew everyone the most, or that she was the ""leader"" in the train car.

I chatted with them lightly and when I relaxed, I mentioned to them, ""I can't wait to get off this train.""

The girls looked at me and started to laugh hysterically. When I gave them a look, one of them said ""You know what you are, right?""

""Dead?"" I answered.

They all nodded and I started screaming and trying to reason with them. I kept telling them that they were wrong and that I was still alive. Sam tried to calm me down and she told me that everyone on the train is dead. She told me that it would come slowly, colors would fade, sensations and feelings would numb until I forget about everything. 

(For those who are unfamiliar with the 7 train, the seats are pretty obnoxiously colored. Here's a link to the train seats: http://imgur.com/oJqAU.jpg)

And sure enough, the colors on the seats began to fade away. When I noticed this, I felt this intense fear crawl up my throat and I shook my head, trying to remember each color and shade until the seats miraculously turned back to their normal colors. It took a lot of mental power, I remember being exhausted and scared. 

Soon, the sky turned dark and the train had yet to stop. I could tell by the blurs that we were moving really quickly. We would pass familiar stops, like Citi Field (formerly known as Shea stadium). There were always people on the stops, waiting for the train and none were looking at the one I was on. No matter how much I pounded on the glass, no one even glanced at the passing train.

I tried to talk to everyone, but they were all oddly quiet. I tried to reason with them. My mother in real life isn't super healthy, but she isn't sick or mentally unstable. I don't know why but in my dream, I was crying in disbelief. I couldn't believe I was dead. I told everyone ""I can't die now, my mother is just getting better. She's taking medicine, she's getting better."" All I could say was ""She's getting better.""

A friend that I know and see almost everyday quietly says ""That's very good...""

Eventually, I crumbled on the floor, completely exhausted. It was then that an acquaintance came up to me. He whispered to me, ""You can still make it. Just don't talk to Sam. She's the reason we're all dead.""

I stared at him and he morosely stared back. I nodded and thanked him, getting up to sit on a seat. It was then that Sam looked at me and the guy. He went back to his original spot and by my stare, she knew that something was wrong. I guess she knew that I knew the truth?

She came up to me with another friend. Seating themselves next to me, with me in the middle, they pressed very close to me and started talking. I don't recall what they said. I knew it was about me being dead or how I should just relax and let go. I know this because every time the colors faded, I would recall them back and they would try to stop or discourage me.

Eventually I started getting scared since they were so close. It was getting unbearably hot and both of them sat next to me, pressing themselves to my side. So I got angry and I told them to sit far away from me. They both were visibly saddened by my words and I apologized, saying it was too hot and I was stressed out.

My friend (not Sam) leads me under the air conditioner. Sam calls out, ""It's no use, you're going to forget how the cold wind feels.""

Sure enough, I didn't feel a thing. I felt the air blowing, my skin reacting with goosebumps, but nothing else. It didn't feel cold. It just felt warm. Like the air in the train was circulating quickly, rather than some sort of cooling device. Like I did with the colors, I tried to remember how the cold felt. I was only partially successful but I realized that the seats faded whenever I took my attention off of them. I curled into a ball, my friend comforting me as Sam sat far away, and I tried my best to concentrate on all of them.

Eventually, it is pitch black in the train and outside. Illuminated only by the moonlight, I think I somehow dozed off and ended up on the floor. Shuffling soon breaks the silence. I look towards the direction of the sound and there, in the moonlight, was Sam, crawling towards me. Her skin was milky white and she used only her arms and hands to come to me. She was dragging her legs behind her and crawled up my legs. 

Terrified, I screamed at her to get off of me. Light instantly flooded the train. I yelled and cursed at her. I must have said ""Get the fuck away from me"" about ten times. 

For the rest of the ride, I sat by two guys. The one who warned me and another friend from elementary, James. We chatted about our lives and we all said ""Let's hope this train ride ends soon.""

After some time, the train stopped. I looked outside and there were people outside of the windows, waiting for their rides. I called out to everyone, ""The train stopped! We can get out of here!""

But no one responded. Everyone was sitting on their seats rigidly, their backs straight and eyes completely forward. I figured ""Fuck it"" and decided to just save my own skin. If they wanted, they can just leave. (Trust me, some of the people were good friends so I feel awful that I did that.)

I pried open the door and jumped onto the train platform. I turn to grab my bag and I see the two guys I was speaking to walk off with me. They come towards me and slowly, as they come closer, I realized something was off.

As we were face-to-face, I realized that I did not know these guys at all. On the train, they were friends or acquaintances. People I knew. Off the train, I realized that they looked extremely similar, but very different. They were not my friends.

What was even more spooky was that they too looked confused. I said ""You're not my friends..""

And they responded, ""We don't know you either.""

And that is when I woke up, my lungs gasping for breath.


I know it's just a strange dream and parts don't make sense. (Like the guy saying Sam killed everyone and him getting off the train?) But it was such a terrifyingly long dream and I have never woken  up so light-headed and out of breath.

I'm sure it's just a scary set of events, but it felt too incredibly real. I wonder if that means that the people on the train were not my friends, but like the two who got off the train, only people who looked incredibly similar to my friends. What if I looked like their friend? I don't know.

70,A strange story from my childhood.,1292081037,"
Been lurking on reddit for awhile, found this board and decided I had something worth posting for it.  This happened at least 13 years ago, I was about eight or nine years old at the time

The first half of my life I lived in a relatively small, rural town.  At the time our only neighbors were a family that lived down the road from us who we remained good friends with the whole time we lived there.  There was the father, Mr. Caudell, his wife, and their son Alex.  Mr. Caudell and and Mrs. Caudell were both respiratory therapists who worked at the county hospital.  It's been awhile and I can't say I remember their first names.  I was a kid so of course I addressed them on a Mr. and Mrs. basis.

To give you an image of where we lived, imagine a gravel road with no streetlights stretching across a field, and two houses separated by about 200 yards.

Since we lived a bit out of the way from town, when my parents decided to have a date night and go out for a movie or something, instead of hiring a babysitter they would usually just leave me and my brother in the care of the Caudell's, and the Caudell's would usually leave Alex in our care whenever they were working late, or decided they wanted to go out.

One particular night my parents were out and my brother and I were at the Caudell's house.  Usually when we were there we watched movies or played Sega and this night Mr. Caudell suggested I pick out a movie from the shelf for us to watch.  The Caudell's had an extensive VHS collection, consisting of both bought movies and those bootlegged ones with the name of the film written in sharpie on the side of the VHC cassette.  The movie I picked out was some John Goodman movie that had a picture him sitting on a throne on the cover.  I looked this up earlier today and found it was called ""King Ralph"".

We start up the movie and that's where things started to seem a bit off.  The movie was completely rewound but started with the opening credits.  No FBI warning, no previews.  The credits looked normal enough, white lettering on a black background with the text fading in and out when naming the members of the cast.  I recall it seeming normal enough, it starting with something like a ""Paramount Pictures Presents"" and naming off the cast members.

It never got to the name of the movie.  About thirty seconds in there was an abrupt buzzing noise and the film cut to what appeared to be an extremely dark room being filmed on a home video camera.  About this time a few confused remarks come from those of us watching it.  And this is where it got weird.

Where we lived, there was no light pollution at all.  So when it got dark, you usually could not see anything because it gets pitch black.  But when there's a full moon, it completely illuminates the night.  I'm also going to go ahead and add that because we lived in the middle of nowhere, in a very crime free county, we had a tendency to not bother locking our doors.

The only noise coming from the video was the shuffling sound that's seems to always be heard when someone's handling a camera.  When the camera finally re-adjusted, you could make out two windows and the moonlight shining through them, illuminating what looked like the inside of the Caudell's garage.  This lasted about thirty seconds when the camera then cut to the Caudell's living room, where we were right now.  The camera panned around the shelves, over the books and family photos.  At one point, the 'camerman' reached out and picked up one of the photos, revealing a slightly wrinkled, Caucasian hand.  It might be important to add that Mr. Caudell was black and his wife was white.  The hand in the video looked to large to be a woman's.

This is the eeriest part of the whole video.  The screen goes blue for a second, and when the video comes back, it's filming Alex's room from the hallway.  Alex's door is open, and from the moonlight you can barely make out him in his bed asleep.  The cameraman filmed Alex, for at least two minutes, before emitting what sounded like a short, guttural squeaking noise.  Alex was obviously woken from his slumber, and a silhouette of him could be seen sort of shifting up from his bed, looking around for a moment, and then laying back down.  The hand reappeared and slowly waved at the now asleep Alex.

The video then cuts to what appears to be the dining room, and from the way the camera was positioned, it looked as if the cameraman was sitting down in one of the chairs.  This was the last part of the video and it lasted about four seconds as the cameraman whispered something.  Mr. Caudell would rewind it twice to hear what he had said.  It was hard to hear, but we think we heard him say ""What is to be done?"".

The video also had one of those date markers on the bottom left of the screen.  The date of the filming was about 15 months previous to the day we watched it.  The VHS tape was definitely one of those home video ones.  Someone had put a white sticker on it and then ripped it off, leaving a strip of white sticker to make it look more like a movie.

This video was later shown to our small town police department who told them that there was nothing they could do seeing as it was filmed over a year ago and that there was no real way to identify the person behind the camera.

Needless to say, we began locking our doors from then on. 

tl;dr: Guy sneaks into neighbors house at night, films their son sleeping.

EDIT: Let's do this thread without a single ""Bed Intruder"" reference. 

UPDATE: I recently got a call from Mr. Caudell, apparently my father told him that I brought up the subject of the videotape.  Caudell says he still has the original copy on VHS, and would be willing to mail it to me so I could upload it to a computer.  Anyone know how to get VHS video onto a PC?

- I remember seeing an animated tv show or movie in which there were sludge monsters under a sewer grate, if they touched you you would turn into one of them and slide down into the sewer with them.  They were gray-green and gave me nightmares, I couldn't sleep unless I was dead center of the bed, terrified they were somehow under my bed.  Someone I know once confirmed that they were real, she even told me what show/movie it was, but now I can't remember again..

- Another animation I saw recently but can't remember the name of.  It was ""____ Hospital"" with an adjective along the lines of ""Wondrous"" or ""Miraculous.""  The short starts with a kid in the snow looking at funhouse mirrors, then he enters a really whacked out hospital and apparently gets plastic surgery.  His head gets pulled out of shape, he looks normal in the mirror however.  Anyone know what this is?  It was a really weird claymation and there was a vending machine which gave out tickets to ""After"" and there was a ""Wizard of Oz"" reference in a pair of striped-stocking-ed feet protruding from under it.

80,I won't be getting any sleep tonight. (True story),1291954455,"   Today I've come across a series of creepy events that I decided to write about and share with you nosleepers. I'm not much of a writer, so I apologize if this isn't exactly an enticing read. 
   
   Anyways, a few hours ago is when it started. I was sitting alone watching TV when I looked out the window and saw a dark figure walking towards my house. It wasn't exactly weird that it was dark, as the sun had already fallen and there was a streetlight just on the other side of the road behind the figure. Also, it looked like a friend of mine who lives just a block or two away, so I figured he'd come for a visit. I walk down the stairs to open the door, but there was no one there. This still wasn't weird because on occasion he brings his dog, so I figured he just went to put her in my back yard. I go to open my back door and there was no one there. I check my front door and, again, no one. I'm a little freaked out, but what ever. 
   
   So I go down on my computer and put on my headphones. I hear what sounds like my dads Blackberry ringing, but it sounded off. It seemed like a  distant noise, but like it was whispering right beside my ear. I only heard the sound once, so I thought to myself I as just hearing things. 
 
   Later, me and a buddy of mine recently started running regularly together. We usually run through a wooded park with lots of trails as we both cannot stand running on straight roads. As I'm stretching, my dogs start to act really rowdy, which they tend to do sometimes, but only when provoked like when I say 'walk time' or something. This time though, they were going crazy over nothing. Once I leave my house, I'm just about at the end of my street about to go meet my friend, when a car pulls over behind me and honks. I look back to see if it were somehow for me, but the car was just sitting there. I had my headphones in, but I could have sworn I heard my name coming from where the car had been. I looked back again, but the car was gone.

   Once I got the the top of the hill that leads to the entrance of the park where I as going to meet my friend. I saw movement there, so I figured he'd beaten me there. As I was going down the hill though, I start seeing less movement. It was dark out, so I convinced myself again that I was just seeing things.

   When I finally met up with my friend and we started out run, I began telling him about the weird things that I'd been experiencing. We're both a little freaked out when we start hearing bangs in the distance. They didn't sound like any firecracker we'd ever heard, nor did it sound like any gun shot. We heard three separate bangs, each sounded different. We're both full out freaked by this point, and we gunned it out of the park and onto the safety of a sidewalk.

   We're turning back now and laughing at how silly we were acting, but also how scary and intense it felt. We came across another entrance to the park, and decided to go back through it. We begin walking through the park to come out where we started. Since it was nighttime and we were walking through a part where we were a little unfamiliar with, we couldn't exactly find out how to get back onto the trail we were on. We eventually got back on the trail and began our return. As we walked through the dark, we began to feel the fear that we were feeling before. We were a few minutes away from exiting the park, when we heard a howl in the distance. I'd managed to ask my friend ""Did you hea-"" before I looked back and saw that he'd taken off in a full on sprint. I cached up to him and after a little bit we slowed down. We exchanged the usual 'wtfs' before we heard the howl again. This time, I was the one who took off. Once we finally bust out of the park, we were shaken pretty good. We walked back up the hill and parted.

   Now, as I finish up writing this, I'm thinking a little more clearly and realizing that there are probably a dozen explanations to what had happened. Still though, I can hear my dogs half-growling at nothing and it's making me a little uneasy. Anyways, I decided I'd share my experiences with you.

82,Walking the Dogs,1291905379,"So over in London, England, quite a long time ago, my dad told me some of the things that used to happen when he would take the dogs for a walk. 

The local park was huge; most of it is untamed grassland and oak forest with no streetlights. In the winter, when the sun begins to go down around 4pm, you end up having to walk the dogs in the pitch black through the woods. It used to scare the shit out of me when I did it alone, as a teenager.  

Alot of scary shit happened during my walks. Sometimes you'd be walking the dogs along a path and one of them would stop and stare off the path and into the darkness, ears perked, fur up and growling slightly, obviously perturbed. Sometimes the dogs would stop in front of you, hesitating, and refuse to go any further, spooked by something that you didn't hear or see but had obviously spooked them. There was one particular spot in the park that looked perfectly normal, but no matter what time of day, our golden lab would refuse to go near at all costs, whimpering and barking at it. 

One particular story sticks in my mind above all the others. My father told me that, once, as he was making the approach back to the park's big iron gates, he heard heavy footsteps walking slowly but steadily towards him on the gravel path. In the pitch black he couldn't make out anything but the small window of light coming from the gate. He called out, asked who was there, but got no response. 

Suddenly, the footsteps stopped.

He told me later that every hair on his body was standing straight on edge as he carefully walked with the dogs over to the gate. He never did see anything from whatever it was, but after that he carried a heavy flashlight with him when he went out.

83,My tour at Auschwitz (somewhat lengthy),1291901940,"Back in 2008, some of my relatives and I went on a 17day tour in Eastern Europe. Needless to say it was amazing and one of the highlights was obviously the notorious concentration camp in Poland. When you first go in, you are greeted by the gate with the infamous phrase ""arbeit macht frei"" which ironically meant ""work to be free"". 

the buildings to be honest looked unimposing, it looked like college housings but with a lot of electric fences. it was rumored that a lot of prisoners committed suicide by holding on to them. though my memory is quite foggy with a lot of facts to take in.

the rooms look like ordinary rooms, with bunk beds pushed together, and the tour guide would say that on one bunk bed, there would be four or five persons sharing it.

the pictures were horrible, the people were painfully thin and sickly and you can see them slaving away or ridiculed or tortured. We even skipped some rooms and exhibits, because I think the tour guide worries that we might be too disturbed by it, so i took a peek (which i deeply regret) and it was about the horrible experimentations.

so next on the tour was the pillaging sort of. the prisoners were required to give all their material possessions except the clothes on their back. even the shoes, warm coats were collected. there was a room with a glass wall and in it were a mountain of shoes, crutches, books/belongings. but nothing was more freaky than that mountain of women's hair.. (my tour agent warned me about it but i didnt get it at first) the hair looks so well preserved, and it was a big room, probably 10 or 20 meters lengthwise and 5 to 10 meters crosswise room with just a mountain of hair of different shades, some in pony tails, some braided. i think the nazis were experimenting on harvesting hair to use it as a substitute for wool and such.. but there it is.. behind that glass pane, amassed like a crowd of people without, well, the person themselves.

of the whole camp, the most dreaded place was block 11. the ""prison within the prison"". there lies the political prisoners, activists, those who were punished and those who were experimented. as if the place cannot get any creepier.. we downstairs to its basement. there were doors with peepholes and you can see that there is a bed to the side, a chair and maybe a small table with a wash basin. at the end of the hall was the standing room (im not quite sure) but basically, it is a one square meter brick room, dark  with just one opening and you can't even lie down in it. that is where the punished prisoners are being held. yes, you read right, *prisoners*.. they would keep 4 persons at maximum in one of those rooms and imagine the claustrophobia and tiredness by staying there all night long just standing with nothing but a wall to lean on to rest.. and the next day, return to work and be fed sludge. i think the longest a prisoner got to stay there before they died was a week. 

we then went outside, thinking the tour was over, but we went over to some small hill with a lone chimney on it (no house or anything but a short chimney sticking out from the ground) as we went around the mound of grassy hill, there was an entrance. the tour guide told the group that those who are too afraid can just stay outside the entrance and wait. it was the entrance to the gas chamber (the first experimental one). when we went it, there was a small lobby sort of and then a door to a very very dark room. we went into that room (i was screaming in my head at that point along the lines of WTF AM I DOING HERE?!!! WTF WTF OMG OMG) the room was pitch black except for the candles with flowers offered probably by relatives and such, and of course, the chimney from the top had sunlight coming in from it. it was said that it was where the poison gas (used for fleas) was lowered to gas the prisoners. there was a small thin rail leading us to the left where another opening was.

we went to the other room, where i was hoping the nightmare would end, but no, it was the crematorium. very convenient of them. once they gassed the prisoners they would just drag them to the other room and then cremate, pretty straightforward and mechanical, which makes it all the more disturbing.

i could hardly sleep that night.. everytime i close my eyes.. i could just imagine being in that dark room with the chimney being the only source of light.. and death. needless to say, couldnt sleep easily for weeks and maybe months.

*BONUS*: while we were at block 11, one of the members of our tour group was rumored to have a third eye. as he was peeping through one of those prison rooms, he saw a figure sitting on the chair..

also, when we went to tour one of the castles in Germany, (where there was reported to have had some witch problems before) the guy with a third eye said that he saw a witch (of course only he can see it) following around one of our tour group member.. FOR FUCKS SAKE I HOPE IT WASNT ME!

(some details may vary.. remembering historical information hasnt been my strong suit, add to that the fact that i was shitting my panties did not help)

84,The St. Augustine Florida Lighthouse,1291864222,"As promised in an earlier post, I have more stories from my time in St. Augustine, Florida, where I lived for approximately 5 years.

During the second half of my time there, I worked in business to business sales. This meant that I spent my days visiting the various stores and tourist attractions. Every once in a while a perfectly rational and seemingly non-superstitious person would break out with an unexpected ghost story. One of my favorites was told my a man (We'll call him ""John"") who used to run a convenience store near the St. Augustine Lighthouse (which is notorious for its paranormal activity).

The current lighthouse tower and keeper's house were badly neglected before being restored by the Junior Service League. During the restoration, workers would stop at John's store for lunch. One day they came in spooked because a huge beam had ""exploded"" from the wall, as though fired by a canon. They could not explain how it happened, and were quite shaken, because the force of the shooting plank of wood would have killed anyone in its path. 

**Edit:** I guess my memory fails me on this point. According to an account I found online, this really did happen, but actually hit a worker and sent him to the hospital. It is fun to find these stories validated online, because the internet was still in its infancy when they were told to me.

The next time the men came in they shared an even more remarkable story. One of the workers walked into a large room to find a man hanging from a rope, tied to a large beam. The worker scrambled to get the man down, but was unable to get the right leverage to remove him from the noose. He ran outside and called for help.

When his co-workers raced in to assist him, they all arrived in the room to find nothing but the worker staring up at the empty air in complete shock. The man walked out and refused to return to the job site.

**Edit:** John went on to tell me that there was a story of a man who committed suicide in the exact location that the hanging apparition was spotted. A quick check on the internet shows that others have reported seeing this same thing.",nosleep,bugmonsters,/r/nosleep/comments/eioux/the_st_augustine_florida_lighthouse/
85,I knew you would get to me one day...,1291783522,"To start this story, let's get some information on my town. I live in a smallish town in Northern Alabama. It is one that everyone has heard of (and likely been through), but it isn't a major city. We still are small enough that you couldn't get away with anything in high school, because someone always saw your mother at Wal-Mart or somewhere and snitched. Being one of those towns, most of the crime around here is petty theft, and maybe some domestic disturbances. Though there is still the occasional crazy that does kill someone...

A couple months back, our neighbors said they were in their kitchen getting a drink late one night and saw someone walking between our houses. He had never seen him before or since, but gave us a heads up. We always lock our doors at night, just out of habit from my parents who grew up in worse areas. Normally, when I see people out at night, it doesn't bother me, because I have went on walks at midnight. I have even cut through peoples yards, just to save myself some time. The thing that I didn't like about this is the fact that there is no where to go once you are in my back yard. There are thick woods that are filled with vines and bushes that make passage impossible. Both neighbors have high fences around their property. So, this guy had to be looking for something...

I have spent many months on NoSleep since I first discovered it. I found it back in late August, when I would lay outside in my hammock reading Reddit near midnight. I thought being surrounded by thick darkness made the stories even better. Now it is too cold, so I lay in my bed reading it on my iPod. I don't enjoy the house being as warm as the other occupants, so I leave my window open. Last night, I was skimming through some stories when I heard footsteps coming through the leaves to my window. I turned my iPod off so there would be no light. As I waited, trying to make no sound at all, I listened. I could hear nothing, but I knew that just because they are making no sound doesn't mean they are not there. I waited what felt like ten minutes trying to be as quiet as possible, but I knew whoever was there could hear my heart beating. That was about the only thing I could hear. I made myself shrug it off to being the wind or something, and tried to go to sleep (without moving to make any noise, just in case). I was almost asleep when I heard him/it readjust their stance in the leaves. Again I was awake, fully aware of every little sound, but there was still no sound outside my window. I tried to stay awake, but eventually was overcome by exhaustion. Fortunately, I woke up this morning in one piece. I guess it was all just illusions, but you never know...",nosleep,box951,/r/nosleep/comments/ei36r/i_knew_you_would_get_to_me_one_day/

87,A Horrific Tale in which Dogs Have Awful Names and Clogs are Worn,1291778209,"First off, it has to be said that I'm the sort of person that frightens easily. Er, well. Okay, not 'easily' in that a wayward creaking door is going to set my skin to crawling every time or that I can't enjoy a good horror story without leaving the lights on for the next few nights, but I dislike visuals immensely. I can't watch gore flicks without crying like a baby. I can't read frightening comics and I avoid every picture link on r/nosleep for a reason. I like text on a page and I've always thought I did well with auditory terror—creepy kids singing 'Ring Around the Rosy?' No sweat off my back.

So, since this story begins with a sound, this story begins with me feeling barely bothered.

I was in my bedroom, scrolling through some newly linked webcomic my friend had suggested over a week ago, but I hadn't had the time to check out. It was late, I was home alone, and no one was on any instant messenger so I figured it was time for something trivial and amusing.

At first, the sound wasn't so bad. Just a sort of chattering like cicadas, but louder than I'd ever heard them with my window firmly shut. Irritating, but that's all. Fifteen minutes went by and the volume increased, but who was I to judge the habits of crawly things? I turned up my music and bravely ventured on into the thick of some convoluted plot the webcomic was attempting to drag me into (but I was tired and I can't remember any of it now—other things ended up taking precedence).

The sound changed. I didn't notice at first, probably because of the thick hum of one of my favorite playlists blasting from my computer speakers, but it was as if the cicadas had all suddenly fallen dead in the wake of a single man—or deep-throated woman—attempting to replicate their song. It was an intense *gargling* mixed with the constant clicking of teeth.

Or something else.

I shut my laptop so even the whir of its fan wouldn't serve as a distraction and listened carefully.

Yeah, that sound wasn't natural.

My room isn't very large, so it wasn't hard for me to venture close to my window. It wasn't quite pitch black outside—I could see the street lamp off by the sidewalk—but the glare from my lamp made it pretty impossible to see the area right outside of my room. I could have turned it off. I could have turned every light off, but I had the eerie feeling that I didn't want to.

Again, I'm a scaredy-cat. Besides, it was probably nothing more sinister than a squirrel and I just wanted it to shut the hell up and surely I was making a mountain out of a molehill.

Another voice joined the first (if you could call them voices). A third. I slammed my hands against either side of the window frame, hoping to startle off the family of surely harmless chipmunks who meant me no personal trauma. Silence. Blessed silence.

It only lasted ten seconds if that.

And it came back worse than before. More than three now—a full chorus of men or women or raccoons or *something* right beyond that wall and I couldn't see a damn thing no matter which way I approached it. With the lamp on or off, it seemed just as bad and I was never going to be ready to turn off the overhead light.

""Hey,"" I said as firmly as I could. ""HEY.""

Quiet again. Couldn't have been more than two seconds before they were back.

I was somewhat unnerved at this point while still rattling off a mental list of all the animals I'd encountered in the area since I'd moved in and how likely it was one of them. In fact, I was so thoroughly convinced of my own idiocy that I was ready to turn back and return to bed or perhaps retire to the couch in the living room if I was going to be such a whiny baby about it all.

The window cracked. My hands were still rather close and I leapt back, sure that I must have caused it with my hit from before, but it was spiderwebbing outwards—little fissures. Small scratches forming a demented snowflake in the glass.

""Hey…?"" I wasn't so sure of myself now. A second point of impact appeared in another section of the window. I couldn't scream which I now believe says nothing good about my survival instinct. My gaze was transfixed on the little craters of damage. And I still wasn't seeing a thing but dark and dark and—that's right—a whole lot of nothing.

The not-people were still speaking to me. I guess they were speaking to me.

""Look, I'm sorry."" I'd seen enough of those horror movies I hate to know that an apology never hurt. Or worked. But maybe I'd be the exception to the rule and this was all explainable. There was a scientific reason for it. No doubt. I just had to keep calm. Mock my fear with my own words. ""I'm going to get a bite to eat and leave you to your…""

One voice now. I didn't have enough time to wonder about where the rest had gone because there was a *thunk* right above me and my heart sank into my stomach. Had to be the neighbors in the apartment above mine, right? It had to be them, only—oh. Right. They were out for the weekend and I had been kindly asked to feed and walk their dog. I was not fond of that dog. Its name was Allie McBeagle which I found to be a very stupid name, but I kind of wish I'd been nicer to it, looking back.

More *thunks*—a staccato of *thunks*. No more damage appeared to be being done to the window—I'd worry about that expense and scientific phenomenon later. I figured it would be best to go check on the dumb mutt and ignore the wild anteater sloppily gurgling at me from outside. I was safe indoors and it was outdoors and my neighbors returning to unmentionable furniture damage because their dog was having a wild 'I am a dog' party somehow seemed a more pressing issue.

Priorities? What are those?

I am not a classy person, so I slipped on my roommate's clogs she never uses but always left by the door and headed upstairs in my pajamas. Like I said, it was late. I had no one to impress. Once I was up the next flight, I walked straight to my neighbor's door and unlocked it with the spare key they'd given me and flipped on the conveniently placed light switch. Surprisingly? The light turned on and that front room looked perfectly docile. I was about ready to leave without comforting the precious pooch when I realized at least one thing was off.

Have you ever had a beagle, readers? They're hunting dogs and lightning fast and they love doors and running out through them at breakneck speed. Normally, Allie would be all over me, covering my knees in slobber as she attempted to evade them and race out into the hall. She was nowhere to be seen.

""Allie! Here, Allie! Look—hallway!"" I swung the door wide open. Nothing.

""Hallway,"" I repeated, pointedly. Still nothing.

I was prepared to rearticulate that access to the hallway was within her pawed grasp when I heard a soft wheezing and thought it best to close the door and at least check into the kitchenette. You know, just in case.

Allie McBeagle was dead. I'm not talking 'mysteriously dead' or 'close to dead' but dead with its—her assailant standing over the cadaver. Corpse. I don't know how to word these things and I never will. There was a lot of blood. A lot of guts. I've don't do well with visuals. Let's all be proud of me for not vomiting on the spot.

""Oh,"" I said.

*I will probably kill you if you don't move right now*, the not-person didn't so much say as it implied by the fact it shifted its gaze from Allie to me.

What's weird is that I can't remember the webcomic at all—which I'd been reading for at least an hour—but I remember the not-person perfectly and I saw it for under ten minutes. It wasn't Slenderman. It wasn't some white, grotesque, faceless creature. Not a lumbering mass or a tree made out of decaying bodies. It was a person. But not. It had eyes—hair. Two arms and a couple of legs. Everything in the right place, but it wasn't the visual there that terrified me. It was that I looked at it and I knew in a way I know I like rice krispie treats and I hate water chestnuts that it wasn't human and it liked me enough to sing outside my window but probably not enough that it wouldn't mind scraping off every bit of flesh from my bones with its not-tongue and not-fingers and not.

""Oh."" I've since vowed never to mock a cliché hero for failing to run the Hell out of dodge ever again. Some sights root you to the spot. Some things make all the parts of your brain that control motor functions shut down. Shock sets in. You end up saying stupid shit like, ""I was supposed to watch that.""

You indicate the dog. You want to punch yourself in the face.

The not-person blinked like a not-not-person and picked up poor Allie by one ear. I suspect this was its way of suggesting I was not a very bright person. Or maybe it wanted to share.

""What are you?"" That urge to punch your own skull in? It doesn't disappear. ""How did you get in—oh. God.""

There were more of them. There was one less than a foot away from me and what bothered me the most was that I *couldn't* feel its breath ghosting across the side of my neck when it breathed out. I don't think it breathed out. If I tilted my head ever so slightly, I could see another four lurking about the previously empty living room. One was opening up the window.

""There's something out there.""

It stopped.

""Do you want it in here?""

They nodded. Altogether like the most frightening synchronized not-swimming team you've ever not-wanted to watch perform while fighting down the largest chunk of bile you've ever had creep-crawling up your throat.

""Okay. All right.""

No movement besides my own nervous vibrations. I always did love being the elephant in the room. The human elephant. The one they knew should probably be killed to preserve the sanctity of their not-secret cult or who the hell knows.

""More of you?""

90, There Is A Ghost Named After Me. ,1291735252,"Last summer, one of my good friends was moving into off-campus housing with his roommates. I didn't go to the school, but I wanted to take summer classes there. The landlord seemed like a fairly decent guy, the house was in good shape, and I got along real well with all of the other guys moving in.
   A few months later, I had decided that I was joining the Army, and would be at basic training halfway through the lease. They were able to find another roommate pretty quickly, however, my name was still in the first draft of the lease. Since my friends apartment was an upstairs one, the downstairs neighbors got the lease with my name on it. They were understandably confused when they met their upstairs neighbors, and there was no SlimJim89.
   
   Cue the weird shit.

   Two of the downstairs neighbors, we'll call them Emma and Claire, took summer classes and stayed in the apartment during the summer. They began hearing noises at night; it sounded like someone was moving furniture around in the attic, scratching on the walls, and dropping heavy things on the floor. They freaked the fuck out, and by the time everyone else moved in, the consensus was the house was haunted. All the ghost seemed to do, though, was make a lot of loud noises, so they didn't call in the Ghost Hunters or anything.  A little while later, they started calling the ghost 'SlimJim89,' after the guy who was on the lease but mysteriously never showed up.

   This Halloween I went to a party thrown by the downstairs neighbors, and finally heard about this ghost. I went up to the attic, where the dancing was, to get my drink on when I ran into Emma. So we're standing around, talking about how there's this poltergeist with my name, when the music just shuts off. There's no one by the computer that was playing the music, no one near the speakers, and all the wires are still plugged in. A minute or two later, the music comes back on blasting, then quiets down, then stops. It comes on full-force again, then goes to the normal volume. Emma flips *the fuck* out (she was pretty intoxicated at this point) and leaves pretty much about to cry. I stay upstairs with this guy who was dressed as the cookie monster (except he was the weed monster,) talking about this mischievous spirit, when the lights just turn off, and when they turn back on, the computer playing the music is lying on the ground. I decided that, fuck that, I was not sticking around with this shit going on, and went downstairs and subsequently got wasted and made out with this completely gorgeous 10 who was dressed as this sexy cop. But that's neither here nor there.
