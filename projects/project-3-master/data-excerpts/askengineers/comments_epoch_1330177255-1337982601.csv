8,"Questions About Offsets With Regards to Machining, or; Product Designer Seeks Engineers Input!",1337873271,"I have some quick questions about offsets and fits with regards to axle/bearing applications. Some material questions as well.

To begin, I want to use a piece of hot rolled steel round bar with a stock size of 1"" OD as a shaft through a tapered roller bearing with an inside OD of 1"". I know enough about materials and real-world applications to understand that HR does not have a tight enough tolerance for this anyway, and that, bluntly, they won't fit. So I need to have the HR milled down; and therein lies question 1. What size OD do I need to have the HR milled down to to fit said bearing? The bearing is an SKF and has very tight tolerances, so I believe the diagrammed 1"" ID even though I have not seen the bearing or taken a caliper to it. It comes today UPS. I have heard to give a .03"" tolerance to allow a flush fit like that, but am not 100% sure and need input.

The second question involves the same SKF bearing and its cones' OD. The OD on the cone is diagrammed at 1.98"". I have two choices in regards to making a ""cup"" for this bearing to fit into. The first choice is using stock tubing with a 2.5"" OD, .25"" wall thickness and 2.0"" ID (weld eliminated) and welding a water-jet-cut sort of washer to it to create a cup. I'm wondering if the 2.0"" ID will hold (with moderate accuracy) the 1.98"" cone, or is not the right size? Or is the variance of size in the tubing enough to make this not real-world applicable?

The second option is to have milled a cup for this cone and bearing. If I go this route, I need to draw it (AutoCAD or RHINO) to give to the CNC guys... So what's my ideal offset? I'd like the bearing to sort of press in, either with hand pressure or maybe a little more.

18,Oil bath air filters.,1337801890,"Has anyone heard of or used an oil bath air filter for personal air? I had one in my old VW and thought it was an ingenious design. After doing some more research I guess they clean much better than standard paper elements and are still used in very harsh environments such as the desert.

After getting addicted to /r/BuyItForLife I'm not unconvinced that this can't be used in a home/shop environment. There is one company that makes a water bath air purifier and there is a vacuum company with very high reviews of output air quality that has a water wash as one of the last stages of air purification. I'm just surprised that I haven't seen something like this for a 'bad' environment.

[Drawing](http://i.imm.io/qgsg.jpeg) and logic behind the design.

1) Forced air squirrel fan. Squirrel fans can move a ton of air for their size. Forced because fans (fluid pumps in general) really don't like being run in a vacuum so it'd be pushing air through the system. Think of the fans that they use to dry off carpets. Those things blow a ton of air. Something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Squirrel-Cage-Shaded-Pole-Blower/dp/B0037SGJH0/ref=pd_sim_sbs_k_2) could cycle the air in a 10x10x9' room every 2 minutes. You could run it on lower speeds for noise but when your roommate burns the popcorn and you need clean air NOW it'll go to 11.

2) Mesh screens on the other side of the oil so that when you do take it to 11 any oil droplets that get blown out the back side hit the wire mesh and drop back down.

3) More twisty-turvy air flow because something with momentum (oil) doesn't like to change directions and will get stuck at one point. The second stage could also be a water bath with some nice smelling fragrances added to make it smell nice in the room.

4) A final air filter. Doesn't need to be HEPA but something that will catch any remaining oil (doubtful). 

Not sure how much fluid of each type would be necessary and I was going to swap out the 10w40 for vegetable/peanut oil for obvious reasons. (or maybe just water would be plenty)",AskEngineers,darkscout,/r/AskEngineers/comments/u1h63/oil_bath_air_filters/

The general question goes to how they are able to paint/coat the entire surface of the part, while still having the part attached to the assembly line.

[figure 1, Dimensions](http://i.imgur.com/VpuAi.png) (in cm)

Conservative estimations:

I am no aero expert so please correct me if I am wrong, consider only the effective wing area on either side of EDF and negligible tail stabiliser, this would place CG 8.66cm from wing root LE (figure 1). Comparing this with the calculated centre of mass labelled CG in figure 1, it would appear they are in close proximity. (I assume this would be the point?)

Without considering any fuselage lift, the wings alone provides 85.352 sq.in (5.5 sq.dm) of area coupled with 2.5kg estimated total weight, I calculated the wing loading to be 455 g/sq.dm and a stall speed of 97.2 km/h (within reasonable range to my understanding.)

I am not sure about lift and drag calculations but I will give it a shot, ρ = 1.08 at 1000ft@15C and V = 100km/h = 27.78 m/s (is this reasonable for true air speed?) coef of lift = 1.5 , coef of drag = 0.15 at 15 degree angle of attack. area of wings = 0.01596 m^2 , area of wings + fuselage = 0.04429m^2

[figure 2, 15 degree angle of attack](http://i.imgur.com/YXjDB.png)

lift force = ½ρV^2 × coefficient of lift × area
            = 0.5x1.08x27.78sq2 x 1.5 x 0.01596
            = 9.98N

37,Why is WiFi so picky about signal strength?,1337656061,"I have a pretty nice WiFi setup, two high gain omnidirectional antennas (one is 15dBi the other 8dBi), two wifi amplifiers (1 Watt), and yet I can't even get a good VOIP conversation inside my house (the WiFi antennas are outside, so there is only one or two walls between my phone and the antennas). The house is made out of wood.

Sometimes in my yard, about 50 meters away from my antennas, the signal is also pretty crappy (about 80 dBi, as reported by my phone).

Now, what really annoys me is that there is this Edge tower 23 KM away(!), and if I have good line of sight with it, I can actually have a good quality VOIP or GSM conversation with someone. The frequency of that tower is 1.9 GHZ, so not much lower than the 2.4 GHZ of the WiFi. The Edge signal is about 90 dBi (lower than the WiFi signal).

39,Fan powered lifting device for senior high school assignment,1337647433,"G'day guys,
Question about creating a lifting device (like a crane):

We have a 5kg load that must be lifted 1 metre from the ground. The only way to power the device is via a 400mm household pedestal fan.

One of the leading students has created a device with gears and cogs attached to a fan but it seems to be slipping as it can't pull the 5kg load, [here](http://i.imgur.com/f1Qvh.jpg?1)

I think the load may be set too high, but wanted to ask the Engineers if they could, with readily available items for high school students, and access to school workshops (lathes, saws, drills etc.) build such a lifting device?

It has been done but with 1 kg loads. These devices have gears attached to a fan which turn the drum.

I like a specific style of mouse, but I've found I don't really like the manufacturers and I've found there are... *things* about the mouse I'd like to change.  Plus, I just think it'd be a really fun project to work on.

So, I thought well shoot, why don't I just build my own mouse?  However, I'm not quite sure where to start.  I think I should be able to write the drivers in C or C++, and I plan on using Sugru to build the body of it.  I also own a mouse similar to the specifications I have in mind that I plan on pulling apart, but I'd need to get a new logic board and other components (keys, etc.)

Basically, my questions are as follows:

* I have my specifications, where do I go from here?
* Are there any recommended guides for building a USB device?  This specific one will function like an optical mouse, and I'll probably salvage parts from my old one (to cut costs, mostly, and cos... well, I can.  The old one basically functions, but is otherwise beaten all to hell.  That, and it's not EXACTLY what I had in mind - I want a mouse with the numpad on the side, similar to Razer's Naga, but I really don't like the styling on that mouse as far as some of the setup of the buttons.)

47,"Civil and Mechanical Engineers, can you give me some insight to help me decide between the two?",1337616929,"I'm starting my sophomore year of college this fall, currently in civil engineering. I could switch to mechanical engineering right now and still graduate in four year, but if I wait any longer, there is a good chance that I will not.


I understand what each major does, but I'm having trouble between the two. Here is my perspective/views/opinions on each...


**Civil**

* I will have good job security since we will be rebuilding infrastructure by the time a graduate

* Opportunities to work abroad and help improve life in developing countries

* Not really engineering in the sense of innovation and designing *new* things

* Making profile drawings and drainage basins in CAD bores the living fuck out of me

* Close to Architecture (Structural, what I want to go into), which is what I wanted to do since I was 10 before I found engineering


**Mechanical**

* An engineer in the true sense of the word - you get to innovate and optimize designs constantly

* I like modeling individual parts rather than large survey point drawings

* Chance to work for cool project at companies like Boeing, Apple, Raytheon, etc.

* Seems like a bit of a ""dead end"" job if you want to be creative (its hard to word this like I mean it) If you want to have big involvement in a project, you work in a smaller company doing low-profile work. If you want higher pay and a big name company, you only get to design one aspect over and over. And I'd imagine there's less opportunity to travel like in civil

* Mech strays far from what I originally planned on doing (Architecture or Structural Engineering) so I don't know if its just a phase I'm going through wanting to switch, but atm I feel like it would be a more constantly-changing fun type of work that would be actually worth talking about.


So I'm asking any students, current engineers, or retired engineers if could give me as much insight as possible on anything that would help me be more confident in deciding to choose one of the majors. Give me as much info as possible on literally anything - why you pick civil/mech, what you do on a day-to-day, if your job is fun/rewarding, how the industry is, confirm or deny some of my bullet points, ANYTHING. I would appreciate it so much since I have to make a decision in the next few days.


**TL;DR** In civil, maybe want to switch to mech. Civil = job security, impressive projects that can leave impact, but boring as fuck. Mech = seems fun and diverse, *real* engineering work, but companies either small scale &amp; high involvement or high profile &amp; low involement on projects. Advise me please.

Dear Manager:


RE: Company position X


I am a second-year electrical engineering student interested in your coop position. Since I was 7 years old, I was fascinated in informatics. I am interested at using my knowledge to develop simulation software for XXX. I am amazed at how vast the possibilities of programming are. For instance, we can create websites or program microcontrollers by the knowledge of programming. I would be thrilled to use my computer skills to work for a company who has sold over 900 simulators and training devices.

I started personal projects using C language such as an automated watering system and I am learning on my own HTML and CSS in order to create a website that will help students in their learning. My curiosity in informatics helped me to manipulate multiple programs and OSs quickly.  I am also learning C++, MATLAB and PSPICE at University. I have developed a great sense of leadership, teamwork and discipline from my 4 years in the Army cadets. My work experience at the grocery store Metro and my volunteering at a cystic fibrosis lab taught me how to adapt quickly to different sorts of work. I am enthusiastic at tackling new challenges with XXX.


I have enclosed a copy of my resume for your review. Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to meeting you in an interview and discussing my qualifications. 


Sincerely, 


Micheal Jackson

78,Could a hydraulic sound amplifier be made?,1337353793,"I began by posting to /r/askscience but nobody seemed to notice so I thought I'd ask you guys:

I've been reading about transistors and electrodynamics and the analogies to fluid systems got me thinking:

Could one make a system, completely driven by fluid pressure (optimally water, but potentially some more convenient fluid), with no electronic parts, that is responsive enough to audible sound waves that it would work by the basic design below?

A membrane or some other surface would pick up air fluctuations that would spur a minute flux in a fluid on the other side of the surface. The pressure would be concentrated to control a valve of some sort -- this would be analogous to a transistor -- that controls a much larger flow of water.

The biggest problem I see so far is to make a mechanical valve shift its position several hundred times per second within substantial fluid pressure. A possible solution, I think, would be that there are more than one step of this sort so that the movement expected from a valve is no more than the associated input can support.

The way I see it from there would be that the fluid would be lead to a tank with a wide, responsive surface on one side and perhaps open on top so that the fluid can escape without taking too much energy with it.

I'm not very experienced in fluid mechanics so there may well be several fatal flaws in the design but I've been thinking about this a lot for the past day or so. (I also don't expect it would be practical, if only because electricity is much more convenient to transport -- and because if it was practical, someone would have done it by now).",AskEngineers,TheSaddestGrape,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ttcfz/could_a_hydraulic_sound_amplifier_be_made/

At first it killed a starlet and I (I felt awful) made immediate fixes such as a low wire with no electricity so it became a physical barrier instead of shocking small creatures. And then last year somehow a squirrel tried to jump the fence and its tail snagged a high wire while its front feet touched the ground. It died unfortunately. I cried a bit and put that one up as a fluke due to the way it died. But tonight I hear a scream and I went out immediately to investigate and saw that there was a fox snagged on the wire. I believe it initially touched and got zapped (it screamed) but then bit the wire and was stuck due to the ac current. Luckily I ran out and disconnected the power asap and it ran away. 

The reason I brought that unit was well I knew nothing about electrical fences and did not do my homework on that unit being continuous shocking versus some that pulse. The company claims it does not kill any animal with a properly made fence...... But doing more research and customer reviews lead me to believe the pulse versions are either not strong enough to work on animals with fur (such as the raccoons I want to dissuade) or they work on batteries which I do not want to keep purchasing due to cost and disposing of said batteries. Also my stupid ass brought this unit because it was the cheapest model on amazon.

I want to ask you engineers if there is a way I can modify the box to make it a pulse version so if an animal bites down on it that it has a chance to release? But it still needs to keep the same dissuading power, as the raccoon tended to try to find weaknesses in the fence last year. It actually ripped the wire down once. Please help.

17,"How much is critical thinking and problem solving stressed in the engineering field, or is that ""reinventing the wheel""?",1337157813,"Hi r/AskEngineers,

I was having a discussion with one of my friends who is an engineering major. I tutor him in his vector (ie multivariable) calculus class, and he has an unappealing propensity to only want to know the steps, out of context, required to solve a problem.

For example: Doing multiple integrals? In that case, multiply this by that. Take an integral of that. Plug this into here. Why? ""I don't know, but it's I need to do next, and it works on every problem like this.""

Whenever I try to get him to have a more solid and broad understanding of whatever subject we're going over, it always falls back on the fact that engineers don't need to know the ""why""'s behind things. Somebody else has already figured that out, and it's not the engineer's job to ""reinvent the wheel.""

He believes memorization of which formulas to use when given a certain subset of information is most important, and has basically that critical thinking is not really required of an engineer.

Really? How true is this?

Ideally I would like something to counter his position and give him something to think about regarding how he is choosing to learn the material, but then again I am not majoring in engineering, so I do not know how much the problem-solving applies to engineers; according to him, not much.

35,Successful (chemical) engineers: How did you get your foot in the door?,1337033588,"Hello everyone,

I just finished my junior year in chemical engineering at an ABET-accredited, mid-ranked university and I can't help but think I made a bad career choice. I have a 3.7 GPA, and I've been doing research as an undergraduate for over a year. I love what I do both academically in classes and what I do in my research. Unfortunately, I can't stay in academia forever, and I will need to get a real job someday.  


This is where I'm worried. I applied for well over 100 summer internship positions (I live in an area known for high employment in chemical engineering), and this netted me a grand total of 2 interviews. The interviews I got both went very well, the hiring managers seemed impressed with my experience, and they both rejected me. They did, however, invite me to inquire about permanent positions when I graduate. It seems competition for internships is just incredibly fierce. 


I'm very worried I won't be able to find a job when I graduate. Of the five people I know who graduated from my program, none of them have been able to find a related job. One is working as a telemarketer, another went to graduate school, and the rest are working retail. I see myself heading down the same path. I'm no better qualified than they are.


I have no family working in engineering to use for connections (this is how most of my friends who found an internship found one), but I do have quite a few professional connections from doing undergraduate research. Ironically, the interviews I DID get were from random ads I found on the internet.


It's my junior year and it certainly looks like I'm going to be graduating without an internship. I'll have another year of undergraduate research when I graduate, but I imagine I'll be at a huge disadvantage without any industry experience.  It's really going to be sad if I spent four years of my life studying a field I'll never be able to enter. I honestly think I should have gone to a trade school sometimes.

37,Looking for some esoteric information to settle a dispute with my boss about fillet/corner/bend radii.,1337018453,"My boss says that a fillet radius only has to be tangent to both surfaces if the drawing says it is a full radius. I say that I have never seen a radius value given with a full radius because full radii are used in places where they want a radius around the entire material thickness. So a radius value is not needed since it is controlled by the material thickness (tangent to three surfaces). 

The question is when a radius value is given, is the expectation that the radius is tangent to the two surfaces or is the expectation that you only need to put n as much of the radius as you feel is needed, leaving sharp corners that would then be smoothed out a bit, but resulting in a a much tighter radius at the end of the larger radius?

If doing this is allowed, then I need to see a spec that shows how much of the larger radius needs to be put on, and how much of the small unspecified radius is allowed to get it to work.

This image shows the two methods I am talking about.

http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9307/fillets.png

The .50 radius on the right is tangent to both surfaces, while the .50 radius on the left is not. If the radius on the left is allowed, I need to see the spec that tells me how I'm allowed to do that.

The following is a description of the actual issue. In this case whats going on is that I am modeling an angle (a long narrow piece of sheet metal bent at a 90 degree angle.) There is also another bend in it that makes this part trickier to form, but that's besides the point for this question. At one end of the angle, a tongue sticks out, but the way the flat pattern is laid out with the radius that is specified, that tongue, which should be flat, gets partially bent by the radius.

My boss is like, just don't make the radius ""full"" or tangent and I'm like, the spec for forming this type of sheet metal says that the minimum radius is the one on the drawing, if I don't make the radius ""full"" then I'll have a tighter radii on there, and that would seem to go against the forming spec. He's like that doesn't matter, and I'm asking him to show me a spec that explains that. He says it's just understood.

I took a thermodynamics course this semester and I really don't like it. As a result, I'm considering switching to mechanical and materials - but I will have to take another course (electrical) to satisfy the prerequisites. Even more complicated is my inclination to do an optional research course (10 hours placement with a PhD student, write a peer reviewed paper, present it). So there are four compulsory courses, 1 electrical course, and 1 research course. If I switch to mech, I will need to do MINIMUM four courses next semester and 1 course over summer semester - and also the optional research course if I choose to. So if I switch to mech, it will be at significant work, time and financial expense. But I am willing to do so if it is worth it - if it's the right choice.

So what I would like is your experience. Please. This decision would be very simple if I actually knew exactly what was involved in chemical, and what was involved in mechanical.

* I'm trying to find internships around my city (Atlanta, GA), but I'm having very little luck so far. I tried through my school's job finder network, but none of the positions appeal to me. Does anyone know of a good internship search portal for engineering related jobs? Or is your company currently hiring interns? I'm not picky about pay, I'm mainly in this for the experience.

* My cumulative GPA is abysmally low (2.2), thanks to screwing around in my freshman year. Is it possible to just put my Engineering GPA on my resume as that's much higher? If so, what subjects should I include when calculating my GPA? Should I include Physics I,II, Chemistry etc. or just Engineering and Math classes?

* I would rather try for an internship instate, but if I get one out of state, is it common for companies to reimburse me for room and board, food etc.?

* Most companies I've looked at require cumulative GPA's of 3.5+. Should I just apply anyway to these companies? These are big companies though.

Can you guys help me find something that will still suit me? (didn't get a ton of help in /r/engineering...)",1336926696,"Engineering student rounding off my Freshman year, and hoping to pick a major before it finally concludes.  

What I've come to realize is that I might not be as suited for engineering as I thought.  The application of math and science just isn't nearly as interesting to me as the theory.  I don't want to switch out of my school as I've already sunk a lot of time into the course load and being an engineer will probably help me more in the long run, so I've narrowed it down to two options really.  I'll try to briefly explain why I think they might work for me.  

* **EE:**  This seemed appealing to me because it felt like the math was much more forefront in this field than in others.  More work with differential equations and whatnot, and things tended to behave more closely to how we modeled them to.  Please correct me if I'm wrong here.  Also, if there's anything I'm interested in the application have, it's definitely more in the direction of building computers than building bridges. 

* **CS:** This is a bit of risk for me.  I really don't have a ton of programming experience, I've never taken a formal class in programming, though we were required to learn some MATLAB and write some scripts for some of my courses.  What I've done, I've definitely enjoyed.  I'm also under the impression that depending on the field you get into, there can be a huge potential for mathematical thinking in the CS.  Also, even outside of math, you can build some freaking cool things with this type of skill set, it can't hurt to be a part of it.

That's my quick synopsis on the situation.  I'm also considering computer engineering as a major, as it's offered at my school as well.  It feels more logic-y,, and I've heard it's a bit like a joining of EE and CS.  Anyway, let me know what you guys think, and thanks a ton.

60,what is the effect of a more stretchy brake cable on a bicycle brake's effectiveness?,1336838126,"Bicycle mechanic here.  It is a widely held truth in the bicycle mechanic community that the more a brake cable (or other components of the braking system) stretches the less effective the brake is.  

I have observed this to be true, at least it seems to be.  At the same time it doesn't make sense to me.  If the coefficient of friction between the pads and the braking surface remains constant, and the input force is equivalent wouldn't the force of the pads contacting the rim be the same, and therefore the friction between the pads and rim be the same?  Regardless of if parts stretched.

An example is when the [bowden cable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowden_cable)'s outer casing (the housing) is more compressible, and replacing the housing with a less compressible one has a noticeable effect on braking performance.  

A more complicated example (more variables) is that [between cantilevers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_brakes#The_cantilever_brake_design) vs [v-brakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_brakes#V-brakes).  Cantilevers have more mechanical advantage in the lever and less in the brake itself, v-brakes have less in the lever and more in the brake.  It is commonly held that this results in cantilevers producing more cable stretch and less effectiveness.

I did my Bachelor's in Electronics and Master's in Electrical Engineering. I have 3 months before I start work and am wondering about how best I can spend this vacation.

My plan is to hook up the manomter to a T and attach a syringe at one end and leave the other open to the atmosphere. Now the syringe is the mask and I want to push the syringe at a rate that sets the manometer equal to the pressure i recorded from the mask directly. This shoudl give me the flow rate if I do it for 60sec or however long before my arms give out or I run out of syringe volume. 

This seems easier on paper than IRL however, because I dont have a motor and cannot hold steady the syringe (it has considerable friction) at such a low pressure.

The approximate dimensions of the water to be contained are:

The rim of the pool can be no more than 200mm wide.

The rim cannot be higher than 460mm, and the water level must be 100mm below this.

The pool must either be constructed in pieces, and carried in through a set of double doors (the exact size of which shall be determined some time in the next 14 hours).

Obviously if constructed in pieces, joining methods must be considered.

",1336429877,"I've been missing smoked foods ever since I moved out to Baltimore (from STL). Well, I was at the store today and saw a flat cut brisket for $1.29/lb and had to pick it up.  So now I've decided I'm going to have to build myself a little smoker for the balcony. I'm thinking of building something similar to [Alton Browns smoker](http://www.naffziger.net/blog/2008/07/05/the-alton-brown-flower-pot-smoker/) though probably a lot  different. 

I'm not sure if I should a [butane burner](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/1-burner-butane-countertop-range-portable-stove-with-brass-burner/472BR1800.html) or an [electric burner](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/avantco-eb100-single-burner-countertop-range-120v/177EB100.html). I think the butane will give me a little more control over temperature, but I also have to have fuel on hand.  I'm also considering using pellets for fuel, but i think it might require more electronics (which, I lack much knowledge on) and more cost. Is that right?

I would like to force air through the smoker, to keep the temperature where I want it. I have a [minilab 1008](http://www.mccdaq.com/usb-data-acquisition/miniLAB-1008.aspx), a breadboard, a notebook, and [this fan](http://www.outletpc.com/ns2336.html?gclid=CLCUr8SZ768CFYje4Aodhm6kzQ). I am not sure of the best way to make this happen. I know I can connect matlab  to the board. Can I put a thermistor right under the meat, read that and run/stop the fan based on that? How would I set all of that to run?  Can I automate more than the fan, as in a four bar linkage to control the knob on the butane grill, would  that be easy to do/reliable? 

I assume ducting fresh air in would be the way to go to, but perhaps having the heating/smoking in one and forcing it into the other would be better. 

Are there options besides the pottery for the smoker? Metal is a possibility, but could I use wood for the walls/top and some variety of clay/concrete/sand for the floor?  The smoker shouldn't ever be above 250F, so I don't think there is a large risk of it all going up in flames, is this correct? Would a wood box hold bad odors/mold/anything harmful? 

 
For the grates, I currently have an abundance of pizza screens (12"") that would probably work, but I very well might get an actual grill grate.  Any suggestions on this matter?

I understood roughly the idea behind extrusion: you push a material, perhaps heat it a bit to increase its plasticity, out of a hole and hey presto! A rod or prism in the shape of the aperture.

But how are hollow items with a solid boundary extruded? For example, a simple copper or plastic pipe. As I understand it, the hollow part is created by blocking part of the aperture (with something called a mandrel?).

That mandrel must be held in place, but surely anything holding it in place will have to be attached to the aperture or beyond it, causing a piece of machinery to be in the way of the hole. That in turn would mean the solid tube has at least one cut in it from that piece of machinery holding the mandrel.

But today we have advantages of far better tools to work faster: a backhoe can dig a hole faster than any crew of men, we have complete surveys available at command, and we have computers to test designs without building them.

But today it takes 10 years to build 15 miles of heavy rail near a city (subway but above ground).

So my question is what makes it take so much longer? Is there one dominate reason or are there several that are about equal?

It seems like a decent job.  I would like the opinion of some professional engineers on whether this would be a poor career decision to take a position in sales instead of engineering.

Additional details about the job: I would build potential client list, do some cold calling (have an outside guy who will do some as well), but mostly talk with engineers and decide whether they are a potential sale.  I would be the ""account manager"" for a new software being marketed by the company.  The pay would be alright, decent base and likely comparable to engineering offers with mid-end commission.

33,I need help determining the differential force created by a vacuum table,1336244314,"**Edit: Solved, thank you**

Here's the scenario:

I have a compact vacuum table with 73 holes in it, connected to [this vacuum pump](http://sculpturesupply.com/detail.php?id=252416&amp;sf=subcategory&amp;vl=Vacuum+Pump+%26+Accessories&amp;cat=Casting+Equipment).

I need to calculate the amount of force that is created on an object placed on top of the table. 

I figured I could use the formula F = pA where p is the absolute pressure and A is the surface area. 
I calculated the total surface area of all the holes to be 3.02e-3 m^2.
Now, when I place something like a wooden plaque (the tables intended use) on top of the table, I get a relative pressure reading of approximately 25000 Pa. That gives me an absolute pressure of 76325 Pa, correct? If I plug those values into the formula above I get a force of about 230 N. That seems fairly reasonable.

Now, when I place something like a piece paper on top of the table, a better seal is formed and I get a relative pressure of 101325 Pa. Which makes sense; the absolute pressure should be 0! However, how do I calculate force from this? If I were to use the formula above I would get a force of 0 N? This is what's confusing me. 

Can anybody share some knowledge on the subject? Thank you!

",1336069538,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub-reddit, but my group at McGill University studies ultrasonic vocalizations made by laboratory rats. We recently discovered that rats make at least a dozen different subtypes of vocalization in the ultrasonic range. A spectrogram of their calls can be seen here http://www.avisoft.com/sounds/fit3.gif. Preliminary evidence suggests that at least some of these calls reflect the animal's emotional state.
 
At present, we have no automated method for categorizing the various call subtypes, so we have to do this ""manually"" from spectrograms - a laborious process to say the least. Automated categorization is complicated by the acoustic variety found within individual call subtypes. On the other hand, we don't think that laboratory rats have an extensive vocabulary, and we have collected tens of thousands of calls but we could use as a training set.
 
My question is: do you think any commercially available voice recognition software could be trained to categorize call subtypes?

Let's just say that I've got a product that's roughly 24""x20""x20"". The product has an expected life of no more than 15k units, and we're trying to keep tooling cost as low as possible while also maintaining the lowest possible part cost. Annual unit sales would be 500-1000 units.

The current concept calls for a single large rotomold integrating a large (5gal) fluidic mixing reservoir into the geometry. The single rotomolded part would contain nearly all visible/cosmetic surfaces, as well as mounting/lead-in geometry for other components and a rigid base plate. The part would also have the bottom trimmed off (straight cuts) and ~16 holes drilled through the walls. Based on our sizing, I'm guesstimating a $12k-ish tool cost (direct draw) with a $40-60 part cost after post-op trimming/drilling.

I'm curious what other manufacturing methods could be used for such a part. Because of the depth of the part, it seems that thermoforming or injection molding would require multiple parts attached (somehow) together. Sheetmetal also would probably be prohibitively expensive. I'm not sure of RIM would be applicable because we'd like the component to be chemically compatible (like HDPE for roto), and it also needs to be structurally strong enough to hold a large/heavy fluidic volume.

My brother is currently in university in his fifth year finishing up his Aerospace Engineering degree (along with a minor in computer science).  Since his 3rd year of University he has been trying every year to apply for internships and part-time jobs, but every year he gets nothing and no replies.  Now, I myself am no Engineer so I do not understand the whole process and the criteria's that are involved, but what I do know is how to be socially interactive and how to strive through the resume and interviewing process to get the positions that I want.  My brother though has Asperger's Syndrome...his syndrome (from what I understand from the psych report) is all towards the ""Social Interaction"" side.  Since about freshman year of high school he has had problems understanding and interacting socially with people.  The basic day to day social interactions, empathy, understanding and catching gestures, facial expressions and eye contact he very often does not comprehend or catch.  

I have tried a lot of times to have him practice the whole interview and discussion process, but I failed at teaching because I too often get frustrated with him not seeing/catching those social gestures, expressions and comments...  I wish I was good at this but I am not.

My brother I think still does not realize his syndrome, what he has, and what he lacks in being able to comprehend like someone else would.  I wanted to know if there are any other Engineers out there that have gone through difficulties in the resume and hiring process that have Aspergers.  If so, could you could share with me your experience, any information, tools or tips, anything that can help me better understand and try to work through this with my brother.

One last thing: although he has this issue, he has lots of friends and people he hangs out with.  He isn't shy and he is very smart (not just being biased, he is actually very smart) and very kind and caring.

Please Inform me and Discuss the logistics of such a design.",1335453848,"So basically I would like to have a basement that goes down 2 floors deep into the ground. The idea behind this is that both basements would be finished off, possibly incorporating one of the rooms as a theater room/man cave/game room. 

**My thinking behind the Appeal of such a design:**

- Cool temperatures in summer
- ""wow"" factor of showing people that you have not one, but two basements down below your house.
- Sound muffling, so we can have loud parties/watch movies at excessive volume without disturbing the neighborhood/people sleeping upstairs on floor 2.


**My Thinking behind the possible difficulties of such a design:**

- Digging a hole twice as deep = Twice the cost?
- Ground Water table- if the basement is deeper than the water table, will we need a massive sump pump?
- Structural Integrity: I'm assuming we would need reinforced, double or triple thick concrete foundation for keeping the pressure of the dirt around the walls on the second basement floor from caving in. 
- Airflow: Will we need enhanced ventilation to not only heat the basements in the winter, but also get good airflow and oxygen down to the second basement level?
- Safety, as the only exits would be up...I'm assuming you would need an extensive fire detection and sprinkler system set up in case of a fire down there.

**Bonus Ideas:** 

- Having a secret door/bookshelf that leads down to the second basement. So people wouldn't know about the second basement if i didn't want them to.
- Possibly build the basements out wider than the house even is, enabling for the basements to be massive, far more square footage than the house itself, with possible alternate entrances or secret exits out to a work shed or something... tunnels, all guys like tunnels i think.

The Wrangler is not without its faults, however.  It handles poorly, brakes slowly, accelerates slowly over 60mph, and gets poor fuel economy.  In an effort to combat the fuel economy issue, Chrysler recently installed the Pentastar V6 which is considered a fuel efficient engine.

What could be done to improve fuel efficiency while still allowing the Jeep to look like a Jeep and perform like a Jeep off road.  I understand the principles, you can either (1) make the vehicle more aerodynamic; (2) make the vehicle's drivetrain more efficient; and (3) summon the spirit of Colin Chapman and ""add lightness.""

I can't imagine that there is an rational reason for the current to pass through them. I mean, even if it was grounded the water shouldn't even conduct electricity well (that is unless they are taking a bath with epsom salts). Even in the case of a toaster, why would the current take an uneccesarily long route through the persons skin and into the nervous system on the way to the other side of the toasting bits. 

I doubt that the tub gets hot enough to cause irreparable damage before the person gets out (lets face it, a full bathtub of water requries a huge amount of energy to heat to the point of being dangerous).

16,General Questions about Systems Engineering,1335410841,"Hi Engineers!

I am considering returning to school to study systems engineering.  The school I'm looking at offers a concurrent Systems undergrad/MBA program that looks interesting.  Can any current systems engineers explain what the discipline is like to study?  What kind of jobs do you do, and is it a practical decision in the current economy to pursue systems?

Quick background: I graduated recently with a B.A. in Econ and German lit form a fairly prestigious liberal arts school.  I haven't been having a lot of luck in the current job market, so I'm looking to get a practical (engineering) and advanced (MBA) degree as well as have opportunities to do internships in industry, which I wasn't able to do through my last school.  I have credits for Calc I and Physics I, and with a degree, I don't think I'll have to worry about gen-eds.

17,How does a computer controlled rice cooker operate?,1335405480,"I recently bought a computer controlled rice cooker.  This is the type with some 10 buttons and a clock on it.  I found that compared to the older style basic rice cookers, it takes roughly 1.5-2 times as long to cook a pot of brown rice.  My question is why does it take so much longer compared to the basic models.

There is a description of the [operation of a basic rice cooker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_cooker#Basic_principle_of_operation_.28basic_rice_cooker_models.29) on Wikipedia, but I'm curious how the newer computer controlled models operate.  One thing I do notice during the cooking process is that there is a clicking noise maybe once every 20-30s which I think is a possibly a relay.  

My guess is that by switching it on and off, it could be used to promote more even heat distribution inside the vessel and its contents.  One thing I notice and like about this rice cooker compared to the basic models is that rice doesn't scorch so it is certainly possible.  However, by switching the power repeatedly and allowing the heat to distribute inside, it also prolongs the cook time longer since there are intervals where power is not applied and thus the temperature does not continuously increase until the final temperature is reached.",AskEngineers,jsdavis,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ssuid/how_does_a_computer_controlled_rice_cooker_operate/
18,Questions from a High Schooler,1335387244,"I am sorry if this is long or silly sounding, I am just unsure of a career path and could use some guidance.

Background info: I am a high school junior trying to find out what to major in and what is right for me. I am a honors student at my high school with a 3.7gpa and some Advanced Placement classes. I enjoy programming and am on the robotics team. I like solving problems and am terrible at writing, and okay at math. 

I am not financially gifted so my choice of colleges are limited. The best schools I could go to are Pennstate University Park or University of Pittsburgh - main campus. This is as a result of being a resident of PA, and the total expenses before scholarship and aid for everything would be ~$30,000 a year (compared to ~$50,000 for most schools). Both these schools offer a ton of majors so that will not be a problem.

My question is am I suited to be an engineer? I love science, and typically get As in science related classes, and physics is my favorite class. Math on the other hand... I never had a good foundation in math and only recently have been playing catch up to get to where I should be. Being honest with myself though I am not nearly as fluent in it as I should be and only pull B+s in honors math classes (currently in Trigonometry). 

The majors I have been throwing around in my head are: Electrical Engineer, Computer Engineer, Computer Science, or a business degree.

 The business degree is only there for if I am totally unsuitable for anything else and need to pursue something that is... something. I would probably pick up a foreign language and a Finance degree. I feel though, that the money is not there and neither would be any passion. 

I  enjoy programming , but I am unsure that I want to be doing that for the rest of my life either. Not only does it sound sort of dull, I also have nothing tangible that I have created. Also, I have heard lots of horror stories about CS and the jobs related in it. This is my qualm with a computer science degree. 

Regarding EE, I feel I am unsuited for it, Mathematically. The content I would find enthralling and actually seeing something tangible would be awesome. Being an engineer would be prestigious and it would be interesting to maybe work with power systems.

Regarding Computer Engineering, I would find it enthralling but once again be beaten by math. Also, I have fears of getting stuck with a programming job. Computers have been my life since I was around 8, and learning them from top to bottom would be awesome.

I do have a passion for science, but I am intimidated by the math. Engineering seems awesome, intelligent, and I would have passion for it... I just feel like I am too inadequate for it. I am unsure I can do it, and have some other questions too...

1. is there really a demand for CS, CE, and EE?
2. Is the big ""stem push"" going to be a problem (flooding the field/lowering the bar)?
3. Am I suited for it?/What can I do to be suited for it?
4. Do EEs or CEs sit at a cubicle all day?
5. Would UPitt or Pennstate be best to go to for any of my listed majors?
6. Are CS jobs as bad as I hear? (working as a software engineer)
7. Will engineering degrees open up more doors then other majors?
8. How easy is it to move to management or owning your own firm? (this would be a long term goal, after working in the field for a while)

Basically, I do not know enough about the demand for these careers and also do no think I am suited for them mathematically. Is it possible to be a good engineer with ""okay"" math skills, but a passion for what I am working on and for science?

I'm not from California, so I don't know more detailed cost of living estimates, but I generally know it is higher.

25,Fluid mechanics: what determines the direction of flow when two paths are possible? (x/post askscience),1335321304,"http://imgur.com/5V71U

http://imgur.com/pBmGL

The first image is the flow path of a ""Reverse Circulating Junk Basket"" used to remove debris from oil and gas wells. Below the tool there will be some length of pipe with a one-way valve such that debris circulated into the pipe is not allowed to settle and fall back into the wellbore once the flow is stopped (shown in the second image).

To keep things simple, let's say the well in perfectly vertical and the tool is 10,000 ft deep. The length of the pipe below the tool is 200 ft. It's is perfectly centralized in the hole (tool diameter = 4.5 in, hole diameter = 6 in). The fluid is water.

My question is this: what controls the amount of fluid that flows back to the surface vs. the amount that is circulated towards the bottom of the well? (refer back to image 1)

In the second image you can see that the fluid that goes downwards and circulates through the debris chamber eventually re-enters the main flow stream just above where it exited the nozzles. This leads me to believe that the vast majority of flow would go towards the surface after exiting the nozzles since the frictional pressure loss for the two flow paths should be equal (since they begin and end in the same place).

Can anyone shed light on this?

Note: I'm 100% sure that the tool works, which tells me at least part of the flow must be going downwards after it exits the nozzles. I just can't figure out why that is.

26,Lets get down to brass tacks:  Does a career change make fiscal sense?,1335313195,"My apologies if this is the incorrect engineering subreddit &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

I am almost 30, been in my non-engineering but technical field (RF/Circuit) for almost 10 years now where I work out doors with my hands all day and this year after my recent promotion I will be bringing home at least $60k. This includes bonuses, mandatory on-call, and overtime as I am hourly.  I have a guaranteed promotion in January 2013 that will provide a base yearly increase of $4k a year which will obviously bump up my bonus and overtime earnings.  Let's assume after this point that I will have an average wage increase of 4-5% year over year if I stay until retirement.

I looked into engineering because the technical parts of my job are what interest me.  My current job is bleak (in my opinion) because I don't want to be old and physically broken from my current duties.

I am currently going to JC to knock out my pre-reqs for a transfer to a good local engineering UC.  I am still torn between electrical/computer/mechanical engineering but that's where I am leaning. Without boring you with the details, 2018-2019 will be the soonest I will transfer, unless it gets to the point to where I can't work and do the classes I need because they aren't available during non-work hours/days.  Then I might finish JC sooner but also leave my job sooner, a cut in my lifetime earnings.

For the UC I will most likely have to go full time which means leaving my job for those 2 years plus any time finding employment.  I am hopeful though that I can find some paid internships.

So basically looking at 3-5 years or so with cut wages and no growth and starting in a new career in ~10 years at the age of ~40.

I hope to retire no later than 63, so I have 23 years to work as a engineer.

So finally the point to all of this.  My life earnings between now and then between the two jobs, does a move make sense financially (also factoring in school loans for UC potentially) over the rest of my work career based on observable salaries?

If it makes a difference, I would prefer to design/build/test things where I can still work with my hands.  I hear these jobs can pay potentially less because there are more candidates interested in the same or because startups are great for this.

My background is in mechanical engineering and industrial energy efficiency engineering, which I did for five years.  I liked the topic, but there was no design.

In my manufacturing internship, someone found out that I had this energy experience and grabbed me for 4 hours a week helping with energy projects.  There is no dedicated energy person on-site and I'm the most experienced energy person on-site.  There's no comprehensive energy plan.

I love the energy work far more than my manufacturing engineering.  My boss has only hinted at me being hired full time at some point in the future, and has explicitly said that I won't be doing my energy work anymore.  I have no commitments from them beyond that despite me asking about a job offer several times over the past four months.  Once I was even told to keep it on the ""down-low"" as if it was some kind of secret.  The only explanation given was that ""the division head is working on it.""  What does that mean??

I don't know if my ego is just too large, but it feels like opportunity is being pulled away from me.  With the energy work, I am in contact with the highest managers on-site and trying to bridge the gap between PM, capital shortages, and energy savings plant-wide.  With manufacturing, I'm working on a very small footprint of a small building, in contact with middle management, and will be spending a considerable amount of time as process support; doing the same job that non-engineers do, and not using any of my math or engineering skills.  I'm also afraid they'll use that as an excuse to low-ball any offer they give me.

Does manufacturing engineering have good prospects for advancement?  Will I be wasting my ME skill set and putting myself at risk of stagnation?  I don't understand non-desk jobs and it has me freaked out, clearly.

Thank you to anyone who reads all of this and replies.  I really appreciate your advice because this has kept me stressed out much more than I need in my final semester.

58,Why hydraulic forces don't cause buckling?,1335161643,"Let's say we have a steel rod with length of 10,000' and a cross sectional area of 0.25 sqin. This rod is submerged to a depth of 10,000 ft under the sea. The force acting at the bottom of the rod is about 1000 lbs; however, when we pull the rod out of the water it will not be deformed. On the other hand, if we were to apply a 1000-lb mechanical force that rod is prone to buckling. Why is that? I tried to think about this thoroughly but have no clue!

**EDIT: I know the question was a bit ambiguous and for that I apologize.
The hydraulic force is the hydrostatic pressure perpendicular to the area meaning that the only force acting on the rod would be at the bottom. So why doesn't the rod get deformed (i.e. buckled) when the hydrostatic pressure in water acts on its bottom surface? I think the [FBD](http://i.imgur.com/eadIu.png) is irrelevant but here you go.**

Ecological engineering combines basic and applied science from engineering, ecology, economics, and natural sciences for the restoration and construction of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The field is increasing in breadth and depth as more opportunities to design and use ecosystems as interfaces between technology and environment are explored.""

70,A few questions about coursework and job prospects....,1335062975,"But before my questions, here's a bit of background on my situation. It's a bit long, but it will help with the questions I have!

I've recently returned to school for a second Bachelor's in  biomolecular engineering. I know it will be very hard work, especially because I've never been a math genius, but I can do it if I put in work and go to tutors etc. I'm very excited and I *want* to do this.

The hardest part so far has actually been my mother's attitude towards the whole thing. (For financial reasons I'm living at home while I'm back in school). I'm too old to pay her any mind really, but what she says does plant a seed of fear in my mind. 

Here are some of her usual comments on the subject :

 ""You know those courses are brutal"" 

""The kids doing this (engineering) are the ones who were already doing science/engineering activities in high school"". 

 ""There aren't any jobs"" 

 ""Those are the fields where they hire you and drop you after a few years to make room for the new blood"".

Other comments seem to be intimating that she believes I'm not smart enough. I might not have been the best student in my science and math classes in high school but I *liked* them, anything to do with physics and biology in particular. Similarly while getting my first degree, I might not have been the best student in my chem or microbiology classes but the material was some of my favorite. I was sad that my major (nutrition/dietetics) didn't have more science classes! (I went to school out of state before and I don't think mom was able to see my personal growth and is now just too old and set to form a new picture of me).

Maybe part of it too is because her dream career path for me is nursing. (That's something I *could* do but I don't really have great desire to).

Anyway, after all of that here's what I would like you real-world engineers to tell me:

1. How important is the intelligence vs. hard work? I'm willing to work at the harder things and I *want* to. Isn't that enough if I'm not a ""genius""?

2. How true is it that all engineers were so actively involved in science/math activities in high school. I was interested but didn't have the confidence and therefore never tried to participate.

3.Jobs? I *know* there must be jobs.

4. Hired and then fired a few years later to make way for new people? This sounds suspicious but I suppose in some specializations could be true, such as some research type positions.

In a nutshell I think my mom's waaaayyy out of her jug on how she thinks about all of this. I have the desire and decent enough confidence now to pursue engineering. I'm tired of listening to her say these things and would like some assurance that she is wrong or at least some good material for a comeback so I can shut her down. I don't like the mental noise her comments create in my head. I want to stay focused and not constantly worry about failure or if I'm wasting time on another degree that will not get me anywhere.

74,Will forced convection heat transfer always exceed natural convection?,1335042434,"Here's a long and very specific question, but I think it's a very interesting one. I'd very much appreciate some discussion:

I'm reading [this paper](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8611664/thatcher.pdf) on ancient Roman baths, which discusses using solar radiation to heat a room via an enormous south-facing opening (a glassless window). The author claims that with a [hypocaust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocaust) (floor/wall heating), you could keep the floor and the walls at around 100F, providing radiant heating which would keep bathers comfortable, even when the outside temperature dropped to 30F.

I'm not convinced, and neither is [this author](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8611664/ring), who wrote a response saying ""You botched the convection calculations, it would be horribly cold without glass in those windows."" [Here's a diagram](http://imgur.com/BxCWV) of the room. The window is facing south(east). The first author claims that the ""stack effect"" (the natural convection shown in the diagram) would only occur in conditions of little or no wind. Higher wind pressure would instead cause a slower flow of air through the room, either through the doors or through the [oculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus) in the ceiling.

This seems absurd to me. I don't see how any amount of wind could *reduce* heat transfer. The author of the response paper agrees, saying:

&gt;The net result would be to set the 52.5 x 105 BTU/hr heat loss calculated above as a minimum value and in windy situations to expect this loss to be even greater with the concomitant effect of an even faster lowering of the bath temperature, more
quickly chilling the nude bather.

Is this the whole story? Could the first author have gotten his facts so wrong? His paper is much longer and more thoroughly researched than the response, so I have a hard time believing that he botched the analysis in such a crucial way.

80,Math or Mechatronics?,1335031949,"Hey guys,
I am currently a Sophomore EE going to be a Junior at the start of next semester. Class signups just happened for me but I have a dilemma. Being an EE, both a Math minor and Mechatronics minor are easy to get (3 extra classes for math, 2 for Mech).

These courses can easily be completed thanks to electives senior year obviously. Next semester, however, is the hardest for EEs at my school and our hardest class, as noted by several teachers, is Signal Processing. Now, if I do a Mech minor I will have to take a Prof I currently have for Prob&amp;Stat who I do not learn well from at all for Signal Processing. If I do Math, I can likely transfer due to scheduling conflicts and take the other SP Professor, who has taught the class for many years (It will be the 1st time the other guy teaches SP, and its his first time teaching Prob&amp;Stat). I think I will want to go into nanotech in the future (not definite but most likely if possible), so I guess Mech would be more beneficial for me, but I fear my SP class will suffer greatly, as I REALLY don't learn well from this guy and I'm not sure if a textbook would be sufficient enough for me to learn it myself. I'm also not sure how beneficial a math minor would be in general, practically at least. Obviously the more math I know the better.

Can anyone give me advice on what to do? What do you think would be the best move for my future? I'm going to talk to my advisor next week as well.

EDIT: Thanks for the comments so far guys. Regarding the teacher issue, though, do you think it would be significantly problematic if I took the guy I don't like?

Datasheet -&gt; http://elcodis.com/parts/5709201/ADC0834CCN_p10.html. The circuit is set up correctly, I'm simulating the clock on the STAMP BS2p microcontroller. My code isn't working and I only have a week left to get results or we have to cancel the launch. Thanks!
  
  
Hey there, my university started this new program where they bring in the smartest high school students in the state and set us up with projects and internships starting our Freshman year. The problem with that is we don't know what we're doing, and it's becoming a very big obstacle to overcome as we get closer to the end of the project.

Our first project is to design and successfully launch a balloon 100,000 ft into space with a payload carrying sensors and a microcontroller to retrieve and store the data. It doesn't seem so hard, but I'm the only computer engineer in the group and I've never worked with the BASIC Stamp language (We're using the STAMP BS2p microcontroller) and I've definitely never worked with integrated circuits on this scale before.

So after completing the circuit board (we're using the BalloonSAT board) and doing the initial tests we were all stoked because it seemed like the project was going to be a breeze. Jump forward a week and a half and I'm still stuck with no results despite looking up and reading everything thing I could find on this darn chip (the ADC0834CCN). I've never seen and much less worked with a chip that takes a code to start so I was lost in the water until I found the waveform diagram. At that point I was pretty sure I could figure it out, but after testing my code and getting a serial output of only HIGH values no matter what we did with our solar power sensor I brought the board down to the electronics lab and used a logic analyzer. Unfortunately for me my code seemed to produce the exact waveform diagram as the example showed, but I didn't not get any values back from the chip.

Any tips or tricks, or even a step-by-step howto would be lovely. I can provide my code if it would help, but it's quite lengthy so I won't post it unless it is necessary.",AskEngineers,Braanium,/r/AskEngineers/comments/skqdk/can_someone_help_me_use_this_adc_chip/

89,Undergrad engineer questioning future- advice?,1334949915,"So I just have some questions to engineers about my future in 'engineering'. 

I'm currently a freshman studying Civil and Environmental Engineering. I have a high GPA, however I'm completely uninterested in mechanics or 'how things work' (bear with me). 

I don't really like math that much...although I really enjoy logic problems and I have found computer programming somewhat interesting, and I do like learning new things. I'm basically passing math because of work ethic rather than any interest whatsoever. I'm more of a 'left-brained' person- I'm good at art, love literature, learning about different cultures, etc. I'm also very passionate about the environment, which is why I chose a double in Civil and Environmental Engineering. While I don't like mechanics or anything like that much, I would enjoy being creative and designing things.

Long story short, my passions are the environment, art, and international relations. I'm minoring in Spanish and Political Science (with a focus on international relations). I basically just want to get an engineering degree to show that I'm disciplined and hard working. I have engineering friends who are VERY mechanically inclined, and are continuously building things and wonder 'how things work'. I feel ridiculous saying that I'm engineering around them, because its obvious that I'm not interested in those things. 

Also, I always hear people saying how Civil Engineering is the 'lowest-paying with a poor career outlook', and it makes me even more nervous.

Is it a bad idea for me to study engineering? I would love to do something in environmental policy or international relations, and I just feel like an engineering degree with minors in the 'liberal arts' that are specfic to my job is much stronger than a major in Political Science or Environmental Science.

94,Graduation... What's next?,1334900851,"Hi /r/AskEngineers,

This is almost more of a life planning question, but I figure this is as good a place as any.

I'm graduating in about seven weeks with a BS in Materials Engineering. My grades are good (around 3.5), the school is fairly well-known, and I had an internship with a major semiconductor capital equipment company over the past summer. I had a pretty good time and decided I'd be happy to go back.

My emphasis over my Junior and Senior years has been overwhelmingly semiconductor materials: processing (litho/etch/dep), MEMS, packaging... I had anticipated I'd be headed for the the semiconductor industry when I eventually got out of (grad) school.

Due to a variety of factors (including personal interest and the advisement of my co-workers), I chose to apply directly to a handful of PhD programs. In so doing, I declined the guaranteed admit to the MS program at my own college. A director at the company where I did my internship implied that if the search for grad schools didn't work out for me, I'd be welcome to come back and work there.

I didn't get in anywhere, but the schools took *forever* to get back to me (about 4 months). So, shit, I think, I'd better try to get that implicit job offer on paper, because I'm graduating with a BS, and I need to have somewhere to go for a year or two while I figure stuff out.

By this point, the company I worked at is in the middle of a merger with another major semiconductor capital equipment company. They're in the middle of ""eliminating redundancies"" - translating to ""we're firing people now, so there's no job for you"".

So, now I'm graduating from school with just a BS in an engineering field most people don't recognize, searching frantically for a job in an industry that usually demands advanced degrees, with a long-term goal of actually getting one.

Any advice? Anyone been in a similar spot before?

95,"Please help me decide between Mechatronics, Mech Eng or EE!",1334896186,"Hello, Engineers!

I have a big problem. I finally sieved through all my interests and options and reduced them to the aforementioned three university courses (two other candidates where Maths and Physics, but I want something that gives me hands-on skills). But now, I can't decide between them.

Mechatronics sounds really good in theory. Enough of each discipline to build cool things (my main motivation, as naive as it might be). However, I'm afraid that it's one of those ""jack of all trades, master of none"" kind of deals, which might bite me in the ass in the future, especially when it comes to potential jobs.

What I'm asking you for is any information that could help me. If you're a student in Mechatronics, how do you like it? If you know of any cool potential jobs after a Bachelor/Master, please do tell. Is one of the three courses more likely not to end in a paper-work-only-job, or one with lots of field work? Please tell me which, because that'd be ideal. Which parts of EE/MechEng are left out of the Mechatronics degree, because it obviously can't cover them all?

My favourite work would probably be to build prototypes of machines/robots/products, work in special effects, or something with lots of field work. I know that these are probably pipe dreams and I'll end up working in a cubicle (that's what people tell me, at least), but I still want to try. Based on that, which Engineering branch would you recommend? Aero-/Space-/Environmental-Engineering would be fine too, as long as I get to actually be in a plane, death star, or outside, while building, testing, measuring, or whatever. tl;dr I want to get my hands dirty, too.

I guess another benefit of a Mechatronics bachelor , as generalist degree, is that I could just take a more specialized Masters afterwards. However I'm not sure if you learn enough Mech Eng in Mechatronics to do a Masters in it afterwards. Input, again, appreciated.

If I had to guess, with the main factors being the amount of thermal mass being heated (therefore, the size of the sample and the hot press mold) and the resistivity of your sample, there would be quite a bit of difference between the two methods.

Under normal operation, the ""Control"" line is disabled (meaning the MAX chip is operational), the ""Drive"" line is also disabled.  Thus the customer can drive RS232 traffic at point A.  Point B is used only as reference Ground.  

In this ""buggy"" mode, we enable ""Control"" to set the mode, and it stays this way until the user makes the switch.  In this mode, RS232 is NOT going to be used at all, so we want it to be disabled.  No big deal.  Just before the reset of the device starts to operate, we enable the ""Drive"" signal and will stay enabled until the device is done.  In short, in this specific mode, we are trying to hard pull A to ground.

The customers device (the circuit is based on the specification, not on their actual hardware, we don't have it) is supposed to read the ""Sample"" line and verify that the signal is ground.  What does happen, is it sees it as ground and everything starts running alone without an issue.  Then suddenly, it will stop working because it saw the ""Sample"" point as high.  We have verified that the ""Drive"" signal stays driven the whole time, that isn't the issue.  

Point ""C"" is the issue.  Something with the MAX3227E chip is causing the customer device to see the ""Sample"" point has high instead of low.  If we cut the trace on the PCB at point C; everything works perfectly every time.  Something about the MAX chip is getting us messed up.

The real problem is we have hundreds of these boards already manufactured and we can't afford to turn the boards.  We could put another FET at point C and use the ""Control"" line to disable the MAX chip, but that would be expensive.  :(  

So, question time, any one have any idea on what we could do or any suggestions for us?

The nature of the device requires that switches are low action, and as far as design goes, I'd like them to be low profile too. Second to that, visual feedback is important, and I'd prefer to illuminate the relevant button rather than have individual corresponding LEDs poking through the panel.

I have a basic idea that I'll need a PCB with a [tactile SPST](http://img.alibaba.com/img/pb/177/789/332/332789177_760.jpg) and most likely some sort of laser cut acrylic button which will sit through a hole on the panel and rest on the button.

My question is: are there better ways to do this? The 2 panel method seems to be the easiest. There are some drawbacks (eg. if I screw up/want to ugprade the design, that's 2x panels to be cut; added weight; added cost) but in comparison to the assembly method, it seems like the simpler way given my lack of experience.

12,Why are certain industries granted Industrial Exemptions when it comes to PE's,1334779833,"   I have read that certain industries (such as Aerospace) are granted industry exemptions when it comes to requiring professional engineers. I know part of it comes to the Commerce Clause (specifically the interstate commerce clause), and how products are not confined to the state in which they are made. But licensure for engineers is required any time their products interface with the public like those in  the Civil discipline. 


   This begs the question, what gives? I don't understand why airplanes and cars don't require PEs yet roads and buildings due.
I am a little lost. I know if a 747 fails Boeing is held liable, but who approves the drawings for them?How is this different than if a company approves designs for a building and it fails (Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse) It would seem aerospace should require PEs.

I also recognize there is a lot of political mumbo-jumbo associated with lobbies and what not, but I don't care about that. I would like a thorough explanation, because it doesn't make sense and it feels like I'm missing a key point.

My responsibilities have evolved over time, but here is what I have been involved in (relatively chronological order):

-Quality Control: Inspected products for conformity to customer requirements, generated inspection reports, investigated processes if problems arose. The main purpose of this was so I could learn about the manufacturing process in the company and move on to other roles. I no longer do this.

-Job expediting: walked around with a chart of all the active jobs we had and made sure everything was running on schedule (this doesn't seem like engineering, so I don't go into any detail talking about this in my resume or cover letter - just mention it). I no longer do this.

-Quality system overhaul: our company is trying to get ISO 9001 certification. I am responsible for coordinating all of this. Drafting documents, manuals, instructions, creating processes, setting up meetings, communicating with employees, scheduling audits, and probably more I can't think of right now. I like to emphasize this because I went into this with zero ISO experience and I think it shows how I can handle large tasks and adapt quickly. This is my current priority.

-Purchasing: I purchase materials, tools, and hardware for the company. Honestly this doesn't feel like engineering, but I'm told it's an important role. I have to make sure things get here on time and meet requirements. 

-Customer communication: sometimes I talk to customers if we run into problems with making parts or if there are things we can't purchase. This is generally not that common though.



So, my biggest gripe with all this is that I feel like these are ALL things that anyone with general competency can do. I really feel like I could have done all this with just my high school degree and I don't know if this job is giving me any useful engineering experience. I want to find a job at a company that offers me more room for growth. I failed to get an internship while I was in university and now that I'm graduated, most companies aren't interested in hiring me as an intern. I don't know how to build my experience at this early point in my career!

To preface, 

I certainly do not doubt that the program could be challenging, I doubt in its practicality. 

My intent was never to compare the discipline of engineering with that of photography, but rather to highlight photography as a program that while being almost completely impractical, generates a mass amount of interest and is generally well spoken of, and then ask if their may be other programs of this sort offered at York. (how do I fix this sentence?)

I am aware that Canada has a space program, but not so sure that it has a space industry.

I should also add that I find it some what concerning that in outer-space there is no longer any need to specialize in a specific field of engineering. 

TLDR: Is it practical to offer Space Engineering as an undergraduate study rather than reserving it as a minor or graduate study offered to engineering students?

43,"Ok Engineers: A dual source, steam powered tesla turbo-prop. How crazy of an idea is this?",1334577517,"Okay, so here is the idea. A small closed loop steam powered tesla turbine connected to a prop for propulsion. By small I mean, ultralight aircraft like powered paragliders, powered parachutes, powered handgliders (aka trikes), etc... Hell, I guess even ultralight airplanes would work too.

The design would be this, the boiler would be ""dual source"" as in it would be either electric induction, or gas (propane, CNG, LNG, atomized gasoline or diesel, whatever) fired. 

The boiler itself would be a non-magnetic material that could withstand the pressure, maybe carbon fibre? Then put a bunch of steel wool or plates or something on the inside, which would maximize surface area for induction. There would also be a silver tube running along the bottom of the boiler where the gas burning/heating would take place. Wrap the boiler in some insulation. 

The entire system would be closed, and I would like to put it under vacuum so the required energy for heating is much lower, but I don't know how that would effect the turbine. Also, the return path, from the turbine to the boiler would have built in condenser properties, like cooling fins or what not.

The heating would be controlled by a microcontroller, the induction heating would be PWM'd, and I don't know how to control the gas version, maybe turning it on/off sorta like a PWM but the ""pulses"" would be much longer, I could also use both an electronic regulator and an electronic valve as well.

I don't know if you can picture it from this description, but I am wondering if this would even be possible, or if it would explode in my face, or just not provide the needed thrust. I am thinking temperatures below 70C and I am not sure about the pressures, again, because I don't know how it would effect a tesla turbine.

The only thing I am completely in the dark about is how to control the speed of the prop, would it be better to control the speed of the turbine by using a 2 way variable valve to route steam around the turbine, or would it be better to use a CVT like system?

Bonus: Maybe adding the ability to bypass the steam part of the system and use a tank of compressed air, a true ""tri-fuel"" system.

49,Am I wasting my time?,1334547260,"Okay, so I'm at a University in the UK studying Mechanical Engineering and I'm in my second year.

Over the past couple of months I've been trying to land an intership at a company to try to get some professional experience that will help me with my final year and perhaps give me a small edge when applying for graduate jobs.  During this time, I've had a chance to really think about the course I'm taking and how I've developed as a student and a person within the last two years.  Now I'm worried.

First off, the course I'm taking isn't accredited by IMechE which is a huge worry to me because I could just be getting taught anything and have some bullshit degree at the end of it that doesn't really mean anything in terms of knowledge I've gained or the ability to implement that knowledge in a working environment.  I spoke to one of my lecturers about this a while ago and, although I can't really remember his response, he basically just told me not to worry about it.

Secondly, everything I learn seems to be just for the sake of learning how to do that one thing.  Nothing is ever said of how the theory is demonstrated in industry or how to design something in accordance with that theory.  We usually are given an assignment and the relevant theory or software is taught in order to complete that assignment, rather than to build a comprehensive, applicable knowledge of the theory/software so it could be used in different scenarios.  For example, we had to use ANSYS CFD to examine the boundary layer of a fluid flowing over a flat plate of a certain length at a certain speed.  Now if I ever have to do that same again, amazing!  Piece of piss.  But if I need to use CFD for anything else, I'm fucked.

I hope I'm not coming off as a complete arsehole with a bad attitude; I'm just hoping that someone will tell me that what I'm doing is completely normal and that it's when you actually get into a graduate job that your learning curve is at its steepest.

52,How to read phase margin on +180..-180 bode plots?,1334538477,"Hello guys

Normally, the definition of phase margin is 180+phase_at_unity. However, i have recently worked with some machines that plots the bode plot from +180 to -180 degrees. The phase at unity gain is then e.g. 87 degrees. Does this mean that the phase margin is 87 degrees? If i were to use the normal definition, the phase margin would be 180+87=267 degrees. But that doesn't sound right?

What do you guys think?

Edit: Here is an example of my measurements. http://i.imgur.com/K5QPY.png

Edit 2: I sort of found the answer. If the machine can be trusted, then [this video](http://www.newtons4th.com/products/frequency-response-analyzers/psm1700-frequency-response-analyzer/control-loop-frequency-response-testing) shows that the phase margin is just the phase at 0dB.

94,"When I simply stop pressing the gas pedal, why does my CVT seem to slow down my car at a higher rate than my older car with a regular transmission? It feels as if I'm slightly hitting the brakes.",1334182337,"**Edit:** There's a chance I found the problem, as described in a few of my comments that were posted a few hours ago. It seems that the manufacturer has programmed the car to brake its engine after releasing the gas pedal. A few people in various forums have mentioned that if you take the car back to the manufacturer, they can disable this automatic 'engine brake' option. This isn't the most reliable source, I'm still looking for more, but to describe it better: [here](http://www.savedpennies.com/?p=151), if you scroll down to view Problem 2. There have also been some other comments in this thread that say it might be something different. The 'engine brake' idea is just something I found myself through searching.
___________________________________________________________________________________
Most people have probably experienced the feeling of slipping the car into neutral and letting your car coast for a bit. For example, if I'm on a downward hill in my *old* car (90s Bonneville) and I let go of the gas pedal while keeping in gear, I can still feel a little bit of resistance depending on the RPMs. But it's a relatively small amount of resistance. If I put the car in neutral mid-coast, you'd feel that resistance go away and you'd be coasting with only the friction of the tires/axles and a small amount of wind resistance (more or less). I could argue the same if I was driving on flat ground, only the feelings might not be as pronounced. On flat ground in my old car, if I kept the car in gear but just let off the gas, the car would continue to travel quite a long ways with only a small amount of resistance from the transmission.

However, now I drive a continuous variable transmission, and I don't think it's coincidental that when I let off the gas there is definitely an extra source of resistance that my other cars didn't experience. Now when I let off the gas, the car slows down at a much more rapid rate. I assume it's the transmission.

Here's the kicker: I noticed today that as I let off the gas at something like 50 km/h, there's that extra resistance and I start slowing down at a higher rate than my old car just as I described above. However, when I get to 30 km/h, that resistance goes away and it once again feels like my old car. I'm not sure what is special at 30 km/h, but I assume my transmission is ...transitioning... into a new state. It's a very sharp, discontinuous transition between two different amounts of resistance. Due to the CVT, the RPMs aren't changing a whole lot going from 50 km/h to 30 km/h, and it's hard to notice a significant change in RPMs once I cross that 30 km/h mark into the 'low resistance' zone. I'm not sure if that makes things more complicated to figure out or not, but it's what I observed.

Am I noticing something that's unique to CVTs, or am I going cuckoo and this is normal in all transmissions?

I'm working at a smaller company who is quickly exploding. Currently we manage all our job specific information on a network drive. That was fine when there was a few engineers but it's becoming very evident that this will not work as volume increases.

I could really use your collective wisdom. I got my bachelors degree in studio art (with a math minor)  in 2008, short story is that I discovered that making any money doing art involves being a serious schmoozer, which I am not. I started back in school last summer at UMD taking undergrad engineering courses, which are going great. I applied to a few masters programs for next fall, and ended up getting in to Carnegie Mellon, which I was really excited about, since what I would really like to do is robotics (if possible, hazardous environment research-oriented (if possible, in outer space)). The issue is that it will cost about 40K per year (just in tuition) for 2 years. I do not yet know if I'm up for a PhD, and in any case wasn't qualified to get into one this year - my thought was that research experience in a masters program would help me decide, and if I got along well with the professor, I could switch up for the second year. Then though I'd have to pretty much carry the debt from the first year, which doesn't seem like a good option either. Should I wait it out with another year of excellent grades in undergrad engineering classes and working in a lab on-campus here (about 9K for a year's tuition here) and try to get into a funded program next year, or should I go for it? Should I be worried about getting a job on the other side to pay all that student loan debt? 

tldr - Go to $80,000 Carnegie Mellon two-year masters program or spend $9,000 and another year in UMD undergrad and try for something funded next year?

They are offering me 60k a year plus health insurance. I will have to deal directly with clients from all over the world, specially in Latin America. I will have to test and debug software from the company, and develop custom made projects for certain clients. I will have to travel a lot around the world, and I speak fluently 3 languages (Spanish, Portuguese and English). I have 3 years of experience, 2 working for the company. I'm an Electronics Engineer but I have been working with much success on software development and support since I graduated.

In my ""research"" I have found that the average salary for this kind of position in Chicago is between 70k and 90k a year. I think I should get more because of the fact that they want me to move out of my country and far from my family and the job involves dealing with clients and a lot of time traveling, plus languages.

Am I correct? What should I ask for? or should I be happy with the 60k? What kind of lifestyle can I have in Chicago with that salary?

EDIT2: Thanks for all the advice, as usual Reddit delivers with the help needed :D you guys are great.

The consensus is that 60k is too low, so I will ask for 85k hoping to get at least 75k, any less than that and I will not move.

19,Brushless DC (BLDC) motor as a generator? Many questions.,1334045861,"Here are some questions that my usual google-fu doesn't seem to turn up. Maybe I'm asking something absurd.

* If I get a regular old BLDC and run it as a generator (a kinetic energy source hooked up to the spindle, and the motor's terminals hooked up to a load), what kind of electrical output do I get? AC, three phase, or DC?

* If the motor is rated for (for example) 40V with motor constant 1000rpm/V, does that mean that I would get a 40V output if I spin the spindle at 40000 RPM?

* How does the amperage rating come into play? Say the motor is rated for 50A input when running normally. Does that mean it as a generator can provide 50A at 40V (minus some efficiency factor)? 

* What if I spin it at 10000 RPM to get only 10V; does that mean I can draw 200A from it (because the power output is the same; 2000W).",AskEngineers,qkoexz,/r/AskEngineers/comments/s2a22/brushless_dc_bldc_motor_as_a_generator_many/

My question is this: 

What's from stopping the RO reject water from being conserved by rerouting it back into a building's main water system for further use (assuming it would not re-feed the RO machine itself.) ? 

If the reject water is deemed safe to drink under health standards, and it would only be further diluted by the main water upon mixing,  what reasons can you think of that would prevent such a system from being implemented??

66,Transmission main? Anode well? Journalist who really needs help breaking engineering terms down into simple copy,1333684234,"Hello, I'm a journalist who's writing an article about a city making improvements to its water distribution system. I spoke with an engineer yesterday about the improvements. He was very helpful and clarified quite a few things. But even after repeated questioning (and some Wikipedia searches), I still don't understand anode wells (a key part of the project), or really much of the below paragraph. What hope do my readers have? Unfortunately said engineer just started his vacation and I don't want to bug him. I was pointed to the company's website for further clarification. I'm still confused: 

""The Water District is removing and replacing three anode wells to increase cathodic protection of District water mains. Cathodic protection is a technique used to control the corrosion of metal surfaces. The District’s system connects steel water transmission mains (the cathode) to a sacrificial anode well. The sacrificial anode well corrodes and is reduced over time rather than the transmission main, which extends the life of the main. The wells are continually monitored to determine the effectiveness of the remaining sacrificial anodes. The newly replaced anode beds have a design life of 20 years. "" 

Cathodic protection? Sacrificial anode? How can I explain that (among other terms) simply?

Especially if they're cooled. In the past we used air cooling to run 500w motors at 3kw continuous. Now we've discovered that by partially filling them with ATF, we can push them even harder. 

The problem is when they get hot, the air and fluid inside expands and will push through the wiring harness if the hub motor is sealed. So we drill a little hole in them so the expanding air can escape. But every now and then a bit of oil will come out too.

I'm currently studying architecture and, while allowed to dream a little, have to base some of my work in the real world so I would really appreciate your input on my idea for greenhouse design.

My project is based in a high latitude environment so, in order to increase sunlight, the greenhouses will rotate in a heliotropic fashion. By floating the greenhouses, I believe this will require a fraction of the energy than if the greenhouses were on a bearing type of system.

The idea isn't totally far-fetched. A company in the Netherlands is already starting to develop [a commercial greenhouse](http://www.rebeccapasternack.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Koen-Olthuis_20090721-7.jpg) that is floating. . I know New York has an educational greenhouse on a boat as well.

My main question is regarding the amount of energy to turn a large greenhouse if it only needs rotational momentum. In the old days, barges could be dragged with ponies through canals so I intuitively feel that if a hull design was sufficiently streamlined, the task could be possible.

I'm currently trying to work up a scheme with correctly proportioned greenhouses, which is proving impossible without understanding the underlying mechanics involved!

Any pointers are greatly appreciated.

What I need is an equation that will let me know when person A will meet person B. The variables that will change:

* Person A speed.

* Person A angle/bearing.

* Distance between person A and person B.

* Person B Speed, which is always faster than Person A.

Also, person B will take the quickest route (straight line) to meet Person A as quickly as possible.

See [image](http://i.imgur.com/PjIY6.png) as a crude example of situations that may occur.

Hopefully this kind of makes sense... Can ayone work out an equation where I just need to change the 4 variables around?

So the answer needed, is how far Person A will move before meeting peson B.

I've been given an asymmetric c-shape cross-section, where the top flange is a different thickness and length than the bottom flange and I was wondering what the best way to find the stresses are.  Up until now, I have only been presented with symmetrical cross-sections.

So far, I have drawn the shear diagram, I have found the centroid of the beam and, therefore, the natural axis.  I have also found the second moment of area, using the parallel axis theorem. 

Tau = V/bI x (integral) y Da

I already have V, b and I so that's fine.

Using symmetrical sections, I could analyse the beam above the Natural Axis and just reflect the stress distribution to complete the analysis.

What I was going to do was use the distances from the natural axis as the limits for the integration and for anything below the natural axis use minuses, with the furthest distances as the top limits.  I have a feeling that this isn't the right way to go about it though.

13,Statics Question.  Need help modeling a load on a gooseneck trailer.,1333416401,"My ultimate goal is to create an Excel spreadsheet that will simulate load placement on my trailer.  (Link provided below for my exact trailer.)  I want to be able to input the weights and location of my vehicles/cargo on the trailer and output the reaction at the kingpin to see how much force will be on my tow vehicle.  I've been out of engineering school for a couple years now, so my ""use it or lose it"" factor is approaching stall speed.  

So here are my questions.  Currently I'm trying to model the trailer as a simply supported beam.  I made the trailer's tandem axles into one point and the kingpin as the other.  Do I need to model the 2 axles as 2 separate points?  If I'm hauling vehicles, do they need to be modeled as separate systems first to find the independent weights for each axle?  eg: I have a jeep and a dune buggy.  2 vehicles, 4 axles.  So would that be 2 total downward forces on the trailer or 4?  The reason I think this isn't so simple is because the jeep will be straddling the trailer's axles.  So some of the jeep will add to the weight at the kingpin while the rest will be behind the axles and lessen the weight at the kingpin.  Ow...my brain hurts now.

That should be good for now.  I may have more questions if we get into a good discussion.  Thanks in advance!

14,Aluminum vs. steel. Weight vs. strength. Make this structure both strong and lightweight. Is it always a simple problem to solve?,1333414406,"Consider this structure:

http://www.webstertelescopes.com/mirror_cell.htm

It is a mirror cell for telescopes. The frame on the outside is connected to the mirror box. The swiveling triangles are the actual support for the mirror, and ensure its weight is equally distributed across all those 9 or 18 or 27 points.

The finished instrument may look like this, the mirror box containing the cell and the mirror is at the bottom:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dobson_truss.jpg

The cell also provides a bit of structural integrity to the mirror box, which is otherwise a simple plywood box. Flexure within the cell should be kept pretty darn small while the scope is moving down to the horizon or up to zenith, otherwise the optics become misaligned and the scope's collimation is lost.

A mirror may weigh from a few kg to dozens of kg, maybe more, depending on its size.

My question is: When trying to make a mirror cell that provides the greatest strength for its weight, is it a simple problem to decide the material that will be used? In other words, could you make up your mind quickly that, yeah, you're gonna use aluminum, or steel?

Let's confine the discussion to materials that are relatively easy to procure, not expensive, and don't require exotic tools and procedures in fabrication.

(The reason I'm asking is that the mirror cell in the link above is made of steel, which is presented as such a better choice over aluminum, but I thought aluminum may actually be stronger at the same weight. Am I wrong?)

EDIT: Believe it or not, thermal expansion is not that big of a deal. You adjust the focus all the time anyway, so temperature changes are taken care of.

Mechanical engineer (4 years + 2 years intern exp)

I currently have a good job and pretty much guaranteed work for at least 5 years and i am about to the get the responsibility of overseeing lower level engineers and technicians in order to support my project(s), not necessarily a manager persay, but they will be ""under me"".

My line is of work is pretty niche (automotive, EV, PHEV, HEVs etc..).

Also my yearly review just came up (I rated myself good to very good overall), but i wont know the results of it until late April.

New job:
Same area-ish. Prototype engine design systems, cutting edge stuff, privately funded. The type of work seems extremely interesting. Possibly have my name on patents, etc...Interview this week.

Now, how do i handle this. 

* Do i tell my boss (they like me and need me quite a bit) i am going to interview (**EDIT**they are trying to job snatch me) for another company to ""check it out"" just as a JFYI. **EDIT in order to have him take this in consideration for my perf review and possibly speed up the process/offer**

* Do i wait and see if i get a job offer from the other company, and if i decide its not for me,  say ""hey boss, this company offered me X amount of dollars JFYI""(note, this will be before my review) this is the tricky part**EDIT2** (maybe my current job was going to offer me more than X for my perf review, but now they say, yes we can match X, and im like ok cool, not knowing they were potentially going to offer me more.)

* If i do like the job, do i take the risk of not having gauranteed work, and/or not being needed as much?

I think i *mostly* want to stay at my current job (haven't interviewed with new company yet, but with my niche market, i'm pretty sure they will offer me something), but i want to use this as a leverage tool for a good salary increase, but how? It is tricky because i wont know the results of my current performance review until late april, but im sure ill have a job offer of X amt of money by the end of this week or early next week.

**Edit 3 - Based on the advice i have received here (thanks guys!):**

* At minimum, i am not letting my current employer (which i dig) know about this and will not factor it in to my performance review

* The more i think about it, the more i want to stay at my company. Guaranteed work for 5 years, possibly being promoted, been there a while, good people, and very good at what i do.

* I will try and talk to the guy trying to hire me on the phone, so essentially a phone interview-ish (they want me to do a half-day on-site full ""interview""), so I don't waste either of each others time. 

* I will most likely deny the on-site full on ""interview"" if they push it and say ""I am happy with my current job at the moment, and I feel an on-site interview may waste time for both of us, but please feel free to contact me again in 6 months for a revaluation"".

I am currently trying to decide which career path best suits me, and I would like the input of any mechanical engineers. My questions: what is your day to day job like, what really gets you excited about your job, what do you hate the most, what problems/puzzles do you solve in your line of work, how did you know that you wanted to be a mechanical engineer, and were your expectations met?


I am currently in a chemistry Ph.D. program, but I have recently realized that this is not a good path for me. I am very practically minded (I don't get excited about science just for science's sake), and I like working on physical puzzles (space requirements, structural needs, mechanical movements...). I think I am best suited for mechanical engineering, although this would require a significant amount of extra schooling. 


Mechanical engineering appeals to me because (from what I believe it to be) it is the kind of work I can really get lost in. I could spend hours on end designing my own lego creations, building something in woodshop, building my own computer, or rebuilding a lawn mower engine. I think the same sort of puzzles and motivations that applied to those activities apply to mechanical engineering. I would like to be very certain of my choice since pursuing mechanical engineering would involve dropping out of a great Chemistry Ph.D. program, and starting over at the undergrad level at the  age of 25 or 26.

What we we are working with is a glass fiber optic cable 50 um in diameter to be mounted to an LED (I don't have the specs offhand, but they're really irrelevant for this problem), and we want to attach them.  

My solution is to take a very narrow steel cannula and modify one end so that the LED can be snugly attached and fill the other end with a reflective epoxy.  Then, I can push the fiber optic cable oh-so-gently through the epoxy before it sets and let it seal up around the cable.  After it sets, the cannula should reflect the light from the LED down to the other open end with no loss, where it will either be reflected back by the epoxy or enter the fiber optic cable.  Ideally, we could do this before the LED was attached so I can notch and remove the segment of the cable the is coated with the epoxy so it doesn't also reflect light.

If any off you guys know what airsoft is, you know that [more than] occasionally the guns break. I was wondering how you guys would build the best airsoft gun. 

* [Here](http://superdoo.net/airsoft1/aeganatomy.jpg) is a basic mock-up of the internals. This is what the electric guns look like internally. 

* [Here](http://aresairsoft.com/for%20web%20only/accessories/Gearbox/l85gearbox.jpg) is a more-detailed version, for those who don't know what a complete airsoft gearbox looks like. 

* And [finally](http://www.iedoutdoor.co.uk/Images/Corte_replica.jpg), this is the whole thing together. 

Common points of failure are:

* The seal between cylinder head and the cylinder leak. My idea was make the cylinder and cylinder head one part, so it is impossible to leak. 

* The piston head loses compression over time. My idea was to use metal rings like in car engines to minimize leakage. 

* The teeth on the sector gear (top-most gear that touches the piston) always break. I was thinking make all the gears wider, and out of better material. 

* The teeth on the piston, even when made out of metal, break. This is because the back tooth that the sector gear grabs is always under the most strain. No clue how to re-design that. 

The most-common guns, known as AEG's (automatic electric guns) use the gearbox that I have been referencing. They are light, portable and easy to keep going. Battery dies, and you just switch it out and your back in the game. New gas guns use a computer to control a solenoid, releasing HPA and propelling the BB forwards. This eliminates the gears, piston, etc. but now you need a remote tank and a line running into the gun, which easily gets caught on sticks and branches when playing in the woods. Using either electricity or gas, how would you improve it?


This is really just a fun project, probably never going to build it, but want to see what you guys think. Thanks guys, and prospective mechanical engineer here!

70,A question about Biomedical Engineering,1332928496,"Not sure where to post this, so sorry if this shouldn't go here.

I'm currently combining Biomedical Engineering with Mechanical Engineering. My uni requires us to combine biomedical with another school of engineering. Now, I wasn't sure what to pick at first so i just picked mechanical because it seemed like what I imagined engineering to be. 

But now i'm wondering, is it a good choice to combine it with Biomed? Chemical and Material science seems like much better choices for a Biomedical engineer. Does it matter? I'm only in 2nd year, but so far i can't think of how mechanical engineering can link with biomedical besides maybe some thermodynamics? 


I'm also doing a material science subject right now and it seems a bit more interesting to me than the mechanical subjects and i feel like it would be more useful for biomed as well.

I was thinking of making a multi touch table (not screen or monitor!!) So this would just function as an input, there would be no display on the table, the touch input would be taken and run through a computer or micro controller which would then control output. 

I've been researching different ways to do this, and there seems to be a lot of options, but most are for a multi touch table screen, with the output displayed using a back lit screen from a projector inside the table. 

So my question is should I just follow these and not use the projector and screen? I'm also not an EE, so this is a little outside my realm of studies, but I do have some experience with wiring, micro controllers, and programming.

I am currently setting up software to control a PID controller (MKS 146C)  but I am a bit confused by the available options. Instead of allowing the user to set the proportional, integral, and derivative gain individually, it only has one gain variable and a lead variable. 

What is the difference between this system and the standard PID controller? How can I tune this system?

16,Wireless Power Transmission,1332557724,"**Premise:** I have a little robot helicopter that I want to run autonomously for as long as possible. What are some realistic ways to keep it powered?


Here are my thoughts so far:

* Solar panels are too slow. They might be a good battery life extender, but not a primary source.
* Maybe I can use a base station to beam some kind of RF at the chopper, which recovers the power in the signal? This would probably get the FCC beating down my door. Besides, I think most RF is too low wattage to get any real power to the chopper even after I add in a directional Yagi or something.
* Get a loop of copper wire, a rectifier and charging circuit, then program the chopper to hover near high-voltage power lines. Inductive coupling would transfer power into the copper wire, but would it be enough to keep the chopper in the air?


It would be *incredibly* badass to have a few autonomous helicopters which only need to find high-voltage lines every few hours to recharge. Who knows, if the inductor puts out enough it might even work on the 220 lines along roads!


Thoughts? Some kind of plastic hook might allow the chopper to recharge without hovering, but the logistics of attaching to a power line (and detaching again) are even worse than the logistics of *finding* their power sources without hitting them!

18,Engineering Ethics Protocol Question,1332529515,"Howdy, 
I'm in engineering school and have an instructor who is adamant about a certain protocol for dealing with potential dangers. His philosophy is that if you can imagine a potentially dangerous misuse or accident that involves your design, you should bring it up verbally, but you absolutely should not put it in writing, be it in an email, in your workbook, on a paper napkin, not anywhere.

While I understand legally where this comes from, it runs contrary to my personal ethics, where I see an engineer's job to fix problems, or at least put a warning sticker on them, but not sweep them under the carpet. By addressing potential dangers in writing you not only put these things down for the rest of your team to address or not address, but also for the engineers to come to improve upon or to ignore.

How does this plays out in the real world? Do individual companies have different policies about how to deal with potential design failures, or would my instructor be viewed as universally negligent? ",AskEngineers,lamoix,/r/AskEngineers/comments/rad1h/engineering_ethics_protocol_question/

I am looking for an ~~internship~~ a job (doesn't have to be engineering related but I figured this would be easiest method to get something like this) somewhere outside of North America that will pay for all my expenses (or that my salary will fully cover all of my expenses), in other words...my goal is to work somewhere outside of North America and return with 0 or more dollars in my pocket. I can make pretty good money working in North America for my internship but I have enough money saved up to do something like this.

Most international co-op programs set up with my school, I end up spending more money than what I will make...which to me..makes no sense.

I am also fully fluent in 3 different languages, and learning another one (at least gaining an understanding good enough to live in the place) will take 2-3 months. I am pretty confident in my learning abilities.

How do I do this?

I've gotten my hands on a nice battery analyzer and I have a nice 'octopus' cable with a single set of banana plugs on one end and myriad plugs for different connectors on the other.

TL;DR:  I'm  going back to school (at a relatively old age) to pursue an engineering degree and am wondering if there are any of you who have taken a similar path and what your thoughts are about where you are now.

I'm turning 29 soon, and feel as though I'm at a point in my life where I need to change things up.

I didn't take school seriously and only have 2 years at a community college. I never really studied, took exams hungover, stopped attending classes that I didn't find interesting or worthwhile, failed a keyboarding class, etc. Essentially, my priorities between 16 and 18 years old were... different, and as a result my GPA is shit (I don't even know what it was when I stopped, but definitely towards the lower end of a 2.). Plus I was working and paying for it myself, so I didn't feel a sense of financial obligation towards anyone.

When I was 18, I landed a decent paying IT job and quit all together. After a few years of tech/network/systems positions, I was offered a job as a programmer. In the beginning, it was new and exciting and interesting, and since I've always enjoyed technology and have been playing with code since my father bought me my first computer, I figured I'd run on that path for awhile.

Fast forward 4-5 years, and I've grown disinterested in being a code monkey. I find myself trying to find creative ways to be creative in an corporate environment where creativity is limited and feel as though I've reached the limit of where I can go.

As I have no attachments (wife or kids), I've dusted off my Art of Electronics book, and have decided to get back into the classroom. It's definitely going to take some work, but it I believe it'll be worth the effort, and I'm  looking forward to it. To be honest, I'm more interested in learning new things, but having a recognized piece of paper will be nice too.

So I know the centroid of a right angle triangle to be 1/3 of the way along both edges. However I was just doing a problem with a linearly decreasing distributed load and when I tried to prove this concept to myself it didn't seem to work.

[Here's](http://imgur.com/OmwTZ) the problem and my bit of solution that doesn't make sense.

What I'm saying is -

1. Decrease in loading is 30N/m/m
2. The load at C is 180N
3. Average load in segment AC is 225N/m
4. This gives a point load of 675N
5. Average load in segment CB is 90N/m
6. This gives a point load of 540N

If 1/3 of the way along the load is the centroid then shouldn't the loading on segment AC = loading on segment CB?

I might be confusing myself because the point load in CB is further away from C than the point load in AC is but other than that I really don't know where I'm going wrong.

So a few questions, what sort of set-up does it take to get a hydraulic test bed to think like this...is there some common machine controller that can be programmed with a simple interface via a laptop or is more complicated than that?

What sort of valving and accumulators and such does it take to move something like this a given distance making sure that the speed does not vary as resistance changes as it progresses through the stroke?

Simple..or complex?

90,Need help constructing a calculation,1332037459,"Hey guys....have a question. 

I have a cylinder with a piston. The diameter of each is 38mm, (well, of course there is a slight difference). 

The piston will move a distance of 30mm.

Before the piston moves, the cylinder is charged with 150PSI. 

How do I calculate what the concluding pressure will be after the piston moves the 30mm? So 150PIS + the difference that the 30mm movement makes. 

Of course, I'll need to determine what the volume of the cylinder is for starts...but I'm just basically looking for how the calculation is made. I can punch in all the numbers and do the work.

91,Motion Time-lapse Rig. Engineer noob looking for a nudge in the right direction.,1332036706,"Hey Reddit, first off I really hope this is the right place to be posting this. If it isn't please let me know where I should be asking this.

So I've been trying to build a motion time-lapse rig for this project I want to work on this summer. Problem is, I have no idea what I'm doing.

[Here is an example of what a motion time-lapse is.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7b24qcIus#t=00m05s)  Basically you're taking a photo every couple of seconds to get the time-lapse effect, but at the same time you're moving the camera incredibly slowly to get the smooth camera move and that sweet sweet parallax.
I've looked up motion time-lapse rigs online and they are sold, but are rather expensive. [Like this one.](http://dynamicperception.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=16&amp;products_id=3)  I'm looking to build a cheaper, but still fairly reliable/sturdy rig of my own.

So the route that I was attempting to take is this:  I make/buy a [camera slider, such as this.](http://www.photomartuniversity.com/2010/07/19/how-to-make-your-own-pro-grade-camera-slider/) And then I need to find a solution to move the camera.  What does reddit think would work? I was looking into servos, but I know almost nothing about them. Is there a way that I could control the speed of them? How would I go about doing this? How could I attach it to the slider in an efficient manner that wouldn't be hard on the rig?

If someone has a better solution of how I could go about something like this cheaply, I would appreciate it very much.

2,Personal Re-Entry Rocket - IMPOSSIBRU?,1331961207,"Astronaut Buzz Lightyear (70 kg) EVA's from the International Space Station in Low Earth Orbit (say 350 km up).

If Buzz falls to Earth at orbital velocity, he will burn up in the atmosphere as discussed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/qylhb/oh_ya_knowjust_someone_skydiving_from_space/c41l12x). The horizontal velocity (ISS orbits at 28,000 km/h relative to Earth) will cause him to burst into flame.

So, Buzz turns on his trusty jetpack and retro-burns until he is travelling 0 m/s relative to the ground.

This burn has to be gentle enough not to kill Buzz, but it can't be too slow because then he will just deorbit before he finishes the burn. That would be fatal because he would still be travelling several km/s sideways as he enters the atmosphere.

Once Buzz has retro-burned all his horizontal velocity, he jettisons the rocket and falls STRAIGHT DOWN to Earth as a spacediver. The gradually thickening atmosphere safely slows him to terminal velocity. Once he is close to the ground, he opens his parachute and lands, none the worse for wear.

IMPOSSIBRU?

* Can it be done?
* How much fuel mass? 
* How cool would it be to dive to Earth from 350 km?

**(Irrelevant bull shit that lead to my current status, only on here in case someone may inquire about it.  Keep moving for my question)**
I have always been a heavily computer oriented person (ie built my first computer in third grade, fixed computers to resell/fee in high school for money) and have known I wanted to be an engineer since middle school, and a computer hardware engineer since high school.  I face a dilemma because I went to college and found myself unmotivated to try. I couldn't stand two more years of general education, and any classes I took in the fields of computers were basic concepts that I had already learned, nothing was challenging.  I ended up becoming incredibly withdrawn, and would avoid leaving my room; not eating for days.  I didn't go back to school the next semester due to being diagnosed for depression (Made a post on reddit at the time, and a few said I had the book definition. I went to a therapist and was diagnosed, but refused to take treatment because a piece of advice that was given on that same question: ""Your happiness is your responsibility"" completely changed how I looked at life, and how it's up to me, and only me, to chisel my life into what I want it to be.)

**Relevant stuff**
So I have turned to Network engineering (I know a moderate amount) which I heard I can get a job without a degree.  I was reading many articles through out the internet and felt very little of what I was reading was written by an actual network engineer.  I am here to inquire about the best route I can pursue in order to land a job of 2-3 years, which I will then go back to college.  I figured getting certifications is the ideal course of action in my situation (with no other qualifications on my resume) but I have seen more articles saying it's not as valuable as it's made out to be.

Additionally, would my job obligations be limited to the construction, maintenance, and moderation of networks? Would there be any opportunities for me to either consult or work directly with teams that are trying to innovate the technology?  And as a jr. network engineer would I be investigating malfunctions in order to come up with a resolution, or would I simply be a grunt that took commands?  I only ask because it's my favorite part about fixing computers, and have a bad habit of losing sleep over something until its fixed/resolved.  

TL;DR  How do network engineer?

**DISCLAIMER**
It may sound facetious, and I welcome criticism from engineers/engineers in school, but I feel that I just need some time in the industry; just to get a taste of the ""promised land"" per se.

We have a clamp on ammeter but that changes depending on how we hold it with respect to the wire, often giving us values that vary upwards of 30% which is unacceptable for our experimental uncertainty.

31,Are power lines next to data lines always bad?,1331740946,"I'm building a project that will use sensors. I'm considering bundling power lines in the same connector as the data lines. Now this immediately strikes me as a rule-of-thumb no-no. But I want to understand *why*, and when that rule doesn't matter.

I've done plenty of concert/music work, and experienced the noise induced by A/C power lines near or across unbalanced TRS cables. But what about DC power? What about low DC power?

Could you give me some insight, or point me to some reading? 

My specific case uses low power (5-volt) and high impedience digital lines from a microcontroller (ala arduino), using a 4-pin MOLEX connector. The idea is one connector with 2-pins for power and common, and the other unused pins would be used for communication lines.

Suppose you have a cylindrical rod with a given cross-sectional area and length. Now suppose you fix one end perpendicularly to a wall. Knowing the material that the rod is made out of (wood, steel, etc.), how could I determine (theoretically - not empirically) the maximum mass of an object that could be attached to the other end of the rod without causing irreversible structural deformation?

In other words, for a given material, how can I determine the maximum torque that the rod can handle?

Also, how would I adjust my calculations if I were to change the cross-sectional area of the rod (for instance use an I-beam instead)?

However, I'm wondering what to look at in regards to beam shape--square tubes, t-beams, or h-beams. I'd like to maximize the strength to weight ratio, but in a nutshell, what are the advantages/disadvantages of each beam type? Additionally, what are the typical uses for each? And in the case of the T-beams, how does its asymmetry help?

I could probably use any one of the three and be okay, but I was hoping for a more detailed background of each one. As a biomedical engineer, I only learned the most elementary of beam theory, and searching around didn't really net the results I was looking for.",AskEngineers,ZanshinJ,/r/AskEngineers/comments/qo0l1/tbeam_vs_hbeam_vs_square_tube/

90,Question on drag coefficient versus angle of attack curve (xpost from r/aerospace),1331144562,"Hi r/askengineers!

I just performed a wind tunnel experiment on a Clark Y-14 airfoil and have created a drag coefficient versus angle of attack curve. I did the experiment by using a wake rake (if that helps at all). My curve has the same parabolic trend as found in a NACA report on the same airfoil. However, my curve is shifted to the right by approximately 9 degrees. The minimum of the NACA Cd curve is about -5 degrees, while mine is about 4 degrees.

I was just wondering if anyone could shed some light as to why this is. My experiment was performed at a Re of 100,000 and the NACA experiment was at 600,000 and according to the Cd curve of a cylinder the Cd should decrease as Re increases. My Cd values turn out to be smaller than the NACA values due to the shift, so I don't think this is the reason.

Do you think that it is just because of bad experimentation on my part, or is it something else? Thanks for the help.

Project premise: design make and test a transmission system for a bicycle that has a motor attached to it, essentially transforming the bicycle into a motorcycle (only a lot cheaper because this design has to be sent and used in Africa). The transmission unit has been bought in from China and now I have to test its performance to see if it matches the specs.

Anyways, after a lot of research, and speaking to some of my lecturers, here's the design I am going for. 

I am using a 1.6 kW DC brushed motor set in a generator configuration and mounted in a gimbal. The output of my transmission system is connected to the motor via chains using a 1:1 ratio. The idea is that as the motor is set in generator configuration, it will generate a voltage. To determine the torque that the transmission unit is transmitting, I will be loading the generator with a resistor bank. The torque applied to the transmission (and therefore the torque that the transmission can transmit) unit will be measured by the rotational displacement of the motor casing mounted in the gimbal (using a moment arm and a force gauge). Data acquisition is done with a load cell, processing unit and a data acquisition software to obtain continuous data as the resistance is increased incrementally.

I plugged it directly into AC, and POW the diode to ground explodes. I figured with so much capacitance, too much power flows through the diode and pops it, no big deal.

5 minutes later we get a call, ""All of the radio stations are off the air."" I run to the back, wtf! All of the transmitters are offline!!! So I run to the main breaker. Eureka, it's been tripped... a 400 amp breaker.

So now I'm curious, did I cause this? Because my bench has a 15amp in-line breaker, didn't trip. It's on a 15amp breaker. Didn't trip. Going through a 400 amp panel, didn't trip. Which is connected to a 400 amp breaker on a voltage regulator, which also - didn't trip!

Well the timing matches up, so obviously! But how did I cause this??? The transmitters are connected to a different 400A breaker than the one I was on, yet it tripped! Mind you, the 400A breaker that tripped was the most heavily loaded breaker. And all of these breakers are coming from a common 3-phase voltage regulator.

One thing to note, that rather than have my voltage multiplier connected to ground, it was connected to neutral.

So my question to you reddit: Did my voltage multiplier spike the voltage for the entire phase causing the most loaded breaker to surge and trip? Or was it some sort of feedback through neutral that maybe caused it? I'm not sure at all :-/

EDIT: Also one more thing to note, I was using polarized electrolytic capacitors... I wasn't even sure if it was going to work in the first place - just kind of fucking around cause it's fun. But if you want me to draw schematics of my contraption, plus even a drawing of the breaker panel wiring overview, I can do that. But if you got a good idea of what I did, I'd rather not draw all that stuff out :P",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/qja9s/spiking_the_voltage_on_a_phase/

18,Shrouded wind turbines - genius or garbage?,1330904244,"I'm a mechanical engineering student in the UK.

This semester as a group project we have to design a bunch of miniature wind turbine blades that attach to a small hub/generator set (max blade disc diameter is ~1m) and create the highest power output. I'm in the camp of wanting to follow conventional design of the kind you see in windfarms. Some of the other members of my group are determined to do a shrouded turbine on the basis that it produces more power.

I am skeptical, to say the least.

As a proof Ive had this:

http://arpa-e.energy.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=1VE21P6jgbE%3D&amp;tabid=221

cited to me, but as far as I can see this company received a grant and a lot of publicity in 2008 and then were never heard from again.

Unfortunately the promotional literature theyve created sounds convincing and I'm not sure how much is accurate or not:

http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/21737/
http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9945005-54.html

By my understanding there are a lot of things being glossed over here, and more googling of ""shrouded wind turbines"" reveals a fairly split camp on whether theyre worth it or not. Ive noticed that most people making the case for shrouds make a lot of assumptions and they tend to work in CFD simulations but not so much in real life.

Because the frequency response is important for both antennas and speakers, I've kind of assumed that the two devices were similar.


Some questions I have been pondering:

- What kind of parameters are important to measure for audio speakers?

- What equipment is used for the test bench? I imagine an anechoic chamber, signal generator, and microphone would be helpful...

- How is the testbench calibrated? (In RF engineering you have standard 50 ohm loads as well as short and open circuits).

- Is the test setup similar for testing microphones?

I'm a bit out of my element with this, but I'm wondering if somebody can help me with what I think is a relatively simple problem I've been having with signal processing.  

I have a simple set of data, collected at 120Hz for about a minute. It is a periodic waveform, with about 40 cycles in total (in a vector of about 7200 data points). 

I wish to model this data in the form:

Y = a0 + a1*cos(wt) + b1*sin(wt) + a2*cos(2wt) + b2*sin(2wt) ..

 and so forth.  Perhaps up to a3 and b3, or however many as required to have a decent depiction of the original data set. 

With MATLAB, I believe I need to use FFt (or DFT?), and then do a trigonometric interpolation.. but I just have no idea how to go about doing this.. 

Ultimately I would like a vector with fewer than ten elements that can sufficiently describe the set of data. Is this possible?

Since I don't need the freezer part anyway I figured I have 2 options for fixing this problem.

1. completely remove the door to the freezer unit, making it part of the fridge.

1. remove all the ice and seal the door with silicone/tape 

and

2b. additionally fill up the freezer unit with full water bottles/cooler packs before sealing it.

62,[HELP NEEDED] [Mechanics] Vibrating mass on a steel beam problem,1330484338,"Dear wise men, I have a problem on rational mechanics, pretty simple for many, buy my knowledge is a little bit rusty.
****
The problem:
&gt;An hydraulic pump (mass *m = 80 [kg]*) is placed in the center of a *L = 1,2 [m]* long steel beam (I assumed an I-beam), Young mod: *E = 210 [GPa]*.

&gt;Said pump works at *n = 250 [rpm]* and vibrates on the beam.
****
So with this info I should be able to **recommend a suspension** (e.g. spring mount) **and a tuned mass damper (TMD)**.

I know most of the math, but I'm in a brain blockade after many calculations with different results.

I'll resume what I have so you can guide me pointing mistakes and/or suggesting the proper ways to solve this.
****
The frequency on the vibration is (natural freq?): *fe = rpm/60 = 4,17 [Hz]*

The weight *W=80x9,81= 784,8 [N]* applied as a force on the center of the beam.

The moment of inertia *I = (m x L^2 )/12 = 9,6 [m^4 ]*

From this on I get different results:

The max delfection on the beam: *defl = ( W x L^3 )/( 48 x E x I) = 1,4 x 10^-11 [m] *

The constant : k = W/defl = 56 x 10^12

the frecuency of vibration when the pump is working would be: *ω0 = (k/m) =  836 [rad/seg] = 133 [Hz]*

So then I'm stuck. I know the simple practical approach would be:

- assume 1 in of delection on the load (assumed stiffness) (defl = load  P / spring constant K)

- natural freq ""fn"" = 188 x sqrt(1/spring defl) [rpm]

- equipment freq or disturbing freq ""fd"" and look for *fd/fn = 3* for minimum isolation and *fd/fn=6* for the max.

and so on...

So tell me what you think, correct me if I'm wrong.

I'd be really thankful if you can guide me into (or out off) this problem.

72,Question involving an axial loaded thin rectangular plate with a circular hole in the center,1330453434,"I am an undergraduate in ME taking a Graduate course as an elective so I am looking for a little direction as to how I should go about obtaining results from a lab we just completed.

The lab involves a thin rectangular plate with a circular hole in the center.  Let's say that the y-axis runs along the length of the plate in the direction of the load with the origin located at the center of the hole.  A strain gage with known gage factor is placed as close as possible to the hole on the x-axis and another strain gage is placed on the y axis halfway between the hole and the bottom edge of the plate.  40 readings were taken, 20 with increasing loads and 20 decreasing loads (readings were taken at static loadings to increase accuracy).  

The material of the plate is known, however we are to find Young's modulus as well as the stress concentration at the hole.  Linear optimization is to be used for the results.

My question is, to find Young's Modulus, we would need to transform the strain readings into stress.  I'm having some trouble locating a formula to do this.  Also, from the people I have asked about it, with only one strain gage near the hole, a function has to be developed in order to figure out the stress concentration at the hole.  I'm not sure where to start on this.

I'm not looking for a finite answer, only a direction because I do want to do this and understand the backing theories involved.  Any help would be appreciated.

so heres the question. a bicycle surely has less resistance than skis, rolling vs. sliding. is it the extra resistance of the skis that makes the treadmill possible? is there an intersection of slope and belt speed which would allow you to stay in place? and if so, would it be possible to include a launch and landing ramp? i know that for a television show, ramps have been driven at basically stationary bike riders, it seems the principle would be the same...?

Logically, the benefits were all there, highlighted in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChfT9cdUiyY). Three burn cycles per revolution? No knocking? Minimal vibrations? It all sounds too good to be true.

My three years of engineering classes tells me it is most likely because of all the contact points (all three tips of the triangle within the epitrochoid) and the force with which they are smashed against the sides.

Does anyone have any experience in the area? Insight?",AskEngineers,HawkingEta,/r/AskEngineers/comments/q7ecg/what_happened_to_the_rotary_engine/

92,Getting started with the Automotive Industry,1330303265,"Hey all, I just accepted an offer to intern as an engineer at the technology center in the headquarters of a major automobile company. I am confident in my abilities as an engineer, and I'm really excited to go and learn and work on the great projects they have there, but I am not as knowledgeable as I would like to be about cars in general. 

I've taken enough classes to know how transmissions work, or how the shapes of the body affects the aerodynamics of the vehicle, etc. Basic individual aspects of the whole. 

What I'm asking is if any of you know any good, go-to websites or books to read up on with more information, be it general or specific (I'm just interested in getting really accustomed before I head over there later this year).

I've tried searching the internet myself, but there's just a lot of information out there to choose from, hopefully one of you has something more central or condensed! Thanks so much.",AskEngineers,danielbriggs,/r/AskEngineers/comments/q7dh0/getting_started_with_the_automotive_industry/

96,Can't remove motor from blower wheel...any suggestions?,1330192463,"Quick background...my heater quit a few nights ago after making some terrible metallic scraping noises.  I went into the attic to check out the furnace and found that the blower wheel was totally out of round and scraping against the housing - I could barely move it at all by hand.

Of course the manufacturer went out of business a long time ago, but I was finally able to find a place that had the matching blower wheel and motor, and I just got both in the mail yesterday.  However, in order to replace both I need to remove the old ones from the shroud, which I need to reuse.  Unfortunately, I can't get the motor to disengage from the blower wheel.

Here is a gallery of some quick pics I took:  http://imgur.com/a/W003W

I've tried a ton of WD-40 and banging against a metal rod flush against of the end of the motor arm - no luck.  Any thoughts or suggestions on what to try next?  I've tried finding a replacement shroud but haven't gotten anywhere, so I'm afraid I need to reuse this one.

I am not at all an engineer, so my apologies if any of my description is no good.  I'm happy to answer any questions for clarity.  Thanks guys.

**EDIT:  Hey guys, thanks a ton for the input.  I was finally able to get it out by sanding it down and hitting it with a torch for a bit, then banging it out.  Took some doing but I finally got the new blower wheel and motor in place and my heater is working again.**",AskEngineers,Woosh29,/r/AskEngineers/comments/q5msq/cant_remove_motor_from_blower_wheelany_suggestions/

Whether for additional downforce or drag reduction, could you use air as fake/virtual bodywork?

Some rough Mental Fluid Dynamics makes me think it could work, but has it ever been done?

Also, I am aware that real bodywork could probably do the same thing.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/q5f6k/aero_question_could_the_fduct_system_used_in/
