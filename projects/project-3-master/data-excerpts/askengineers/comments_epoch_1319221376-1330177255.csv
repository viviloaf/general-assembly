0,College student here. Can you recommend careers I should consider?,1330172243,"I'm about to enter my final two years of undergraduate schooling (studying mechanical engineering). Since I've only got two summers to intern with and find an employer, it seems that it's about that time to choose what field I'll be working in for the foreseeable future. 

I'd like to choose a career path that **eventually** leads to the management of some kind of repeatable construction project. Let me specify by saying that I have no desire to work on the design or maintenance of *a subsystem of a subsystem*; I'd like to eventually work my way up to big-picture oversight.

Some examples of careers that (afaik) fit this discription:

1. Mining Engineer - Manage projects to extract subterranean resources 
2. Petroleum Engineer - Manage the design, placement, and construction of oil wells.

Are there any other engineering career paths that are similar in nature to these, that fit my previously mentioned criteria? They don't have to involve the acquisition of resources. I'd just like to eventually have a career managing some kind of repeatable construction project (""big picture"" engineering). How would you recommend getting into those fields? Just scrounge the career fair? 

I'm honestly sitting at a fork in the road here. I'd appreciate any specific, tangible advice you can give me (tangible as in, not ""take your time"", or ""do what you like"").

Thanks for reading.

1,Some concrete  questions,1330160204,"I've got a couple of questions about curing/ breaking concrete beams. 

1) for a two or three day break, does putting the beam in a caltank really matter? Is there actual strength difference between that and one just kept wet in the mold?

2)  is the cure uniform, or does the outside/inside cure faster? 

3) why is testing some concrete for flex strength more important than its compressive strength? The concrete we're testing is for the airport, if tensile strength is so important, why wouldn't they use fiber reinforced concrete?

We went to be able to have 3 sine wave generators that can change offset, frequency, and amplitude. These will be converted into mechanical vibrations.

frequency ranges would be about 10Hz - 1Khz

force very small. Imagine a radio antennae that would attach to an old fashion radio being bent rapidly. That would be about the level of force required.

A proposal:
I thought about a pipe with the one end closed and the other end attached to a speaker. I worry the vibrations will be too small.

What careers have you seen co-workers or classmates move into other than engineering?",1330113385,"Around my junior year of college, I had a sinking feeling that civil engineering wasn't for me. I worked my ass off anyways, graduated with a 3.7 GPA, multiple internships, the whole deal. I figured that I've come this far, I have $20,000 in student loans -- there's no turning back now. Unfortunately, that sinking feeling has only gotten stronger. I don't hate engineering, I just don't have any sort of passion for it.

6 months ago I took a structural engineering job. It's difficult to pay attention when every day I want to scream and run away, never turning back. I am just an EIT now, but I don't *want* to become a PE. I don't *want* a promotion. The work is just so... boring. Every single day is the exactly same. My biggest fear is that this is just life after college and isn't specific to engineering. Alas, I want to know my options.

All throughout college, my professors would talk about how diverse civil engineering is, and how many opportunities there are even outside of the field of engineering. I'm just wondering if anyone here has any first-hand experience outside of engineering, or knows someone who does. Maybe hearing the experiences of others will spark something in me.

TL;DR: I'm a naive little child who wants life to be exciting, but I'm finding more and more that it is just kind of boring.

12,Can we destroy ourselves? Mind Exercise,1330111273,"I hear a lot that there is a fear that if the world entered another World War it would be the end for humanity. That we have enough nuclear weapons to completely destroy the Earth, not once but many times over.

I played with this website, [NukeMap](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/), and noticed that although powerful, the biggest nukes don't cover as large an area I had originally thought.

Here is what I came up with:

As of 2009, there were 23,375 nuclear weapons reported.^[1] If each one was as large as the biggest nuke ever designed (Tsar Bomba @ 100MT) it would have a destructive blast radius of 33km-35km.^[2] If each bomb was detonated 70km apart to maximize destruction, the total destruction would cover 89,957,542km^2. If you want to add the little nooks between circles of destruction it becomes ~99,192.395km^2

The Earth has a total land area of 148,940,000km^2, thus 49747605km^2 would be untouched by the destructive blast wave, This is the biggest destruction currently possible. Also, all of the Earth's land isn't in one big chunk, so even more land would be untouched. Island countries and nations would seem to luck out (Madagascar, Bering Strait islands, a lot of Pacific Islands).

Another thought is that most nukes would be fired from and at other 1st world nations. Large portions of Asia and Africa would go untouched.

So by my calculations, a significant portion of humanity would survive the initial destruction. How much fallout would exist and how bad could a Nuclear Winter get? I haven't been able to find much information on that besides sensational sources. Yea it would be bad for those who lived and humanity would be crippled, probably fall back to the bronze/iron age. But completely gone? I don't think so.

What are your thoughts? Would we survive?

When I am given a difficult project at work I can't to go to my boss to clear ambiguities. He addresses issues other than my question and doesn't point me in ANY direction. I feel he doesn't focus enough on the initial steps. I think our company lacks reproducibility because of this. We half ass a design through the initial stages, then a customer orders it and we are rushed to complete their order. We end up putting ""bandaids"" all over the product, never solving the problems for future production. Then we move on to some other product that a customer ordered... Wash, rinse, repeat. I am becoming frustrated with our design/production process. 

My boss is a smart guy, I just feel like he is trying to juggle too much at once. He has 7 years experience but doesn't have time to fully help with my projects. My coworkers only has 2 years experience, so he isn't that knowledgable either. It is just hard to learn quickly in that environment. 

We have another facility that is about a 2 hour plane ride away that has 2 engineers and they both have 20+ years experience. When I spent a few weeks with them I picked up a lot. Very bright guys.

My questions are these:
1. If I were to leave because I am unhappy would I find these same issue somewhere else?
2. Should I start looking for another career, still EE, but in a different field?
3. Should I consider asking for a transfer to the other facility where I will learn more?

(x-post from r/engineering),1330033289,"My girlfriend works at a US engineering firm that only allows her to charge time to a particular project or to overhead. However, she feels she is under pressure to keep her utilization down (something like the ratio of hours charged to overhead:hours charged to projects), so she will work many hours without reporting them at all. She is salaried, but I think this is unfair because she is only ""supposed"" to work 40 hours a week, but this results in her having to work many hours at home after work and on weekends because she can't make it to 40 hours for particular projects because she's doing work (for her boss or whatever) that doesn't necessarily fall into one particular project that she can charge it to, so she has to make up that time some other time. She says that her colleagues also do this, but I'm not convinced that's true.

Do you work in a situation like this? Is this actually common or are they taking advantage of her? Even if this is common do you agree that it seems unfair?

I have some Java programming homework that I'm having problems with and was wondering if you guys could help me out.
The first problem:

Using the DrawingPanel class, write a complete Java program that produces the following figure:
 
This figure is 600 pixels wide by 200 pixels high.  Its background is yellow and the various lines are drawn in blue.  The lines are spaced 10 pixels apart vertically.  There is no line at the very top or the very bottom of the panel (the top line is 10 pixels below the top of the panel, the bottom line is 10 pixels above the bottom of the panel).  Notice that the diagonal lines intersect at the midpoint of the bottom of the panel.

//This is what I have so far:

import java.awt.*;

public class YellowBox {
 
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    DrawingPanel panel = new DrawingPanel(600, 200);
    panel.setBackground(Color.YELLOW);
    Graphics g = panel.getGraphics();
    
    g.setColor(Color.BLUE);
    g.drawLine(0, 0, 300, 200);
    g.drawLine(600, 0, 300, 200);

This is the second problem:

Using the DrawingPanel class, write a complete Java program that produces the following figure.  If you complete the exercise, you might consider making the size, number of spirals, and/or the position changeable using parameters.

//This is what I have so far. Basically just a black box.

    int y = 10;
    int length = 190;
    
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) {
      g.drawLine (x, y, x + length, y);
        x = x + length; 
      g.drawLine (x, y, x, y + length);
        y = y + length;

29,Anyone help me repair this fairly simple circuit board?  Not my area of expertise.,1330014084,"So, this is a Rotel power conditioner, about 10 years old or so.  It served a couple of functions: a line frequency filter for audio equipment, a surge protector/powerstrip, and a staged power cycling for different outlets so that you can have a master control that doesn't pop your speakers.

Anyway, it seemed to be working, but one relay on the board was buzzing up a storm, (as if it were cycling rapidly?).  I got a replacement relay of the same type, just put it in.  Still buzzes, and now the power amp light won't come on, either.  One of the diodes immediately before the relay looked strange, as if it had been damaged.  I took it out and tested it (not sure if I tested it right), but it still seemed to have some directionality.  Did get turned on once w/o diode.  That might have been dumb, but it happened, and didn't seem to change the behavior.  Haven't yet put the diode back in.  

This isn't a hugely expensive piece of gear, but I'd like to get it working now that I've put some time in it.  Anyone think they might be able to help me diagnose it?  

Here's the service manual with a schematic:

I have a few ideas, but so far nothing that I think would really impress an employer.  I want to show initiative, self-motivation, and ability to conduct independent research and experimentation.

I am a chemical engineering major, so my area of expertise is in thermodynamics, process design, mass transport, separation processes, and chemistry.  I don't mind researching and learning new things though, especially if I'm working towards solving or making something.

As of right now, I plan on making a [CMoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMoy) amplifier to show my competance in building elementary circuits.

I have another plan to strip down an old saxophone and maybe plate it with some metal. Haven't thought this through yet, though, and now that I'm mulling the idea over it doesn't sound plausible.

I am skilled with my hands, have access to glassware and possibly a lab to work in, and I'm interested in most everything.  I have access to and familiarity with Matlab and ChemCad.  I probably have access to any necessary software though, and wouldn't mind learning how to use something else.  

I'm currently thinking about projects I want to undertake and I'm sure I could find something to apply myself that interests me, but I wanted to reach out and see what other people would suggest.  If possible, I would like to kill two birds with one stone and bolster my unimpressive resume with an independent project, so what do you think would interest potential employers/post-grad schools?

53,"Is the engineering start-ups/business ""culture"" replacing real engineers with charlatans?",1329853422,"When I finished college a few years ago, my professors really pushed us to form start-ups, and a few of them being successful entrepeneurs themselves, showed us some of the ropes.  It pretty much went as follows:

1)  Get a group together, assign roles (CEO,CTO, etc)

2)  Develop some technology, give it a fancy name or acronym

3)  Create a company, give it a crafty name

4)  Pitch and sell your work

After a few months of developing our technology (which in my case was a computer vision system), we went through a whole mock presentation where we presented our work, our company's business plan, financials, etc.

I liked learning the business side, and from reading articles written by scientists/entrepeneurs, developing business skills and understandings is a necessity to bringing inventions to market.  AKA if you want to get rich starting a tech company, you better learn the hustle.

But the technology was always crap.  Well maybe not crap, the system that I built worked to a nice degree, but it was still sub-par.  

Even where I work now, I notice a lot of engineers are more concerned with the ""pitch"" or the ""sale"" of their technology to upper managenment, whether or not it actually works.  I feel like these people are running a scam.  Yet they get funding...

So what's going on here reddit?  Is the ""forming a start-up after college/learn the business side of engineering"" culture replacing a generation of real engineers, who can build things that work, with fake engineers, who care more that the pitch of their tech will sell?

Is this not unlike quack medicine in the early 20th century?

64,Hypothetical scenario on large displacement beam deflection,1329758418,"Let's suppose I have a long, thin rod made of a highly elastic material such as NiTi (thus no plastic deformation). I can load the rod at the tip with any direction of force (Fx, Fy, Fz) and two direction of moment (Mx, My), so I'm ignoring twist. So presumably I can produce a solution of the shape of the beam and the location of the tip using FEA or some other numerical method. Since the the displacement is likely non-linear I will avoid trying to solve the problem analytically.

My question is, is it possible to go the other direction? Meaning that if I was given a tip location, somehow figure out what tip loading produced the location.

My thoughts on this are:

1) Given a tip location, I could possibly model the beam shape using a spline equation and determine the most likely beam shape by picking the solution with the lowest strain energy. However, I think that this would only give me stress and strain information for the beam and not necessarily a unique solution for the loading since it is possible that more than one loading scenario results in the same tip location.

2) I would produce a solution array by modeling Load -&gt; tip location and then use it as a look-up table in the reverse direction. However, again the solution is likely not unique and I would need some sort of criteria for choosing the most likely solution. Possibly strain energy again but I'm not sure that this would work very well or have any accuracy.

I guess im not sure if the screw can act as ground because there's enough metal around it and the ESD wouldnt be a lot of coloumbs due to low current, or more because the screw in between sockets is wired to the ground for that function.

**EDIT:** thank you all for the excellent explanations involving the assumptions I should NOT make! I will carefully inspect the outlet before assuming anything about the ground.",AskEngineers,m_0g,/r/AskEngineers/comments/pwkej/is_the_screw_in_an_outlet_always_a_ground/

But I am reposting it b/c I didn't get much response from engineers in unions.  This is likely due to the poor timing of my original post.  So if you've already responded, feel free to do again, or simply ignore.*


So I work at a factory that employs about 30% union hourly labor and 70% salaried non-union engineering, engineering technicians, PM, managers, HR, etc. Why so this ratio? Without getting into who I work for, we utilize many highly technical fabrication processes that need a lot of support staff behind those processes.


Over the past few years, our relationship with cooperate and other influencing agencies has caused great frustration and disillusionment among the non-union employees. These changes we have seen include: multi-year pay freezes (including cost of living), reductions in pension, increases in heath care plan costs, decreases in health care plan coverage, reductions in 401k contributions, no attempt to deal with salary compression, new limitations work time flexibility, and most importantly: no sign of any positive change.


If the company were done poorly, or not meeting customer standards, I would understand some of this. But the company's stock price has gone up to a new all-time high, and we continue to produce to our customers demands while winning awards for quality. New hired assemblers for the union at my workplace now make more than I did when I started as an Engineer I less than 2 years ago, and I won't see my first raise till 2013, and possibly 2014. And they haven't seen most of the negative changes we have to our benefits.


All of that being said, the union is now making a move to add the salaried employees (including engineering) to it's union. This will obviously give the more bargaining power, but I don't know what the risks are, and what I could benefit from joining or signing with them.

We're currently experiencing a 'feast or famine' condition within our heat treat (for stress relief) operation.  One of the (many) avenues we're taking to approach this project is to optimize the cycle time of our oven.

Currently, the oven runs 3-3.5 hours for a cycle of brass-substrate parts, and about 7-7.5 hours for steel.  The first part of these cycles 19-35 minutes is ramp up, 45 minute dwell, then cool down.  So, as you can see, our longest segment of the profile is waiting for the oven to cool.  We've discussed any potential constraints regarding scaling and concerns regarding cooling too quickly.  However, since we're only coming down to ambient temperatures, our materials experts advise that there is no risk to the parts if we cool ""too quickly.""  Though with the size of the oven, I doubt that would be an issue.

Some quick background: the oven is sealed, pumped full of nitrogen (to prevent any ignition within the chamber), heated using natural gas, and cooled passively over time.

We're hoping to cool actively (either closed loop liquid or work in some type of active ventilation).  However, we need to prevent any internal ignition (some of the parts heat treated/stress relieved are done so on cardboard reels, so we have to avoid a flash point), and there is concern with scaling of the steel if the air + heat allows for oxidation above a certain temperature.

To further our efforts and justify costs of retrofitting the oven, we're hoping to re-purpose the heat.  That is: if we can build in some type of heat exchanger, either into the oven itself, or into the ventilation system, we want to try to recycle to heat into our plant water heaters and heating system for other operations, including heating the plant itself during the winter months.

21,About Engineering Unions?,1329264518,"So I work at a factory that employs about 30% union hourly labor and 70% salaried non-union engineering, engineering technicians, PM, managers, HR, etc. Why so this ratio? Without getting into who I work for, we utilize many highly technical fabrication processes that need a lot of support staff behind those processes.


Over the past few years, our relationship with cooperate and other influencing agencies has caused great frustration and disillusionment among the non-union employees. These changes we have seen include: multi-year pay freezes (including cost of living), reductions in pension, increases in heath care plan costs, decreases in health care plan coverage, reductions in 401k contributions, no attempt to deal with salary compression, new limitations work time flexibility, and most importantly: no sign of any positive change.


If the company were done poorly, or not meeting customer standards, I would understand some of this. But the company's stock price has gone up to a new all-time high, and we continue to produce to our customers demands while winning awards for quality. New hired assemblers for the union at my workplace now make more than I did when I started as an Engineer I less than 2 years ago, and I won't see my first raise till 2013, and possibly 2014. And they haven't seen most of the negative changes we have to our benefits.


All of that being said, the union is now making a move to add the salaried employees (including engineering) to it's union. This will obviously give the more bargaining power, but I don't know what the risks are, and what I could benefit from joining or signing with them.

23,I need a glue that's remains viable when exposed to temperatures of 60 Kelvin (~ -350 Fahrenheit),1329254771,"Bit of background:

I'm trying to take a resistance vs. temperature curve for a high temperature superconductor (specifically, a YBCO high Tc).  We sputter gold contacts onto the superconductor and then use indium to attach wires to the gold contacts.  The problem is that the indium and gold connections don't stick particularly well together.  We can get the wires to attach, just not strongly. We then have to connect the SC to a contact plate and solder the wires to our micro resistance measuring device; we typically end up knocking at least 2 of the gold indium connections loose before we can solder them all (I think we've probably tried to make this work for about 10 hours now).

It looks like the successful past attempts often glued the wires to the SC *itself* so that there wasn't any stress on the indium/gold contacts themselves; that way we could solder the connections we need without having to worry about breaking the indium/gold contact points.  Unfortunately, this is the first time the prof is leading the lab and no one knows a glue that's viable at the temperatures we need.  Does anyone know of anything?

**TL;DR** Title.

**Edit:** Tried to clarify things a bit.  Here's some pics that should give a much better clearer idea of what's going on.  Basically, I want to glue the purple ""wires"" to the SC itself in order to alleviate stress on the gold/indium connections (where purple meets orange).

26,"Did I inadvertently ruin my life, by settling on college and a job?",1329194326,"So here's my deal.  9 years ago I graduated high school, with 5 APs finished (scored 5s on all of them), and several near-perfect scores in my science SAT2s, and a 1330 on my SATs (back in the day before they changed the exam)  I liked science, however, I didn't want to be ""specialized into oblivion"", so I applied to colleges as a liberal arts major.

I didn't get into any of the Ivys I applied to.  I looked into MIT, but after seeing how you need to declare you major freshman year, I decided not to apply.

I ended up going to a state school.  For the most part, I was miserable.  The student body was incredibly ignorant.  The professors were uninspiring and didn't give a damn about me.  I had very little camaraderie with students into my classes.  I hated the place.

Nevertheless,  I graduated ECE, with an Economics Minor, with a 3.4 GPA.  I chose ECE because I thought electronics were neat.  A lot of that in-major GPA was due to grade inflation I'll admit (I barely showed up to a lot of classes), however, I finished 2 senior design projects where I worked incredibly hard and earned my grades.  

So I toughed it out, and 2 weeks after graduating, I got a job.  This was back in 2008, a month before the big housing bubble collapse and rising unemployment.  I settled on the first job that gave me an offer.  The pay is great, benefits are excellent, and I get to go to graduate school for free.  But its a government job, and 80% of the people there are lazy slobs.

From the work I've accomplished, I have two patents pending, and one award.  But it makes me angry that there are people there who make a lot more than me, who sit in their cubicles and watch CNN all day.  

So here I am now, and I feel like I'm settling.  And I also feel I'm being lumped with low caliber people; that I'm too smart for where I am.

I'd like to do more with my life.

What now?  What kind of course corrections can I perform?  I've thought about switching jobs, but I don't want to lose my salary and benefits since I didn't have much growing up.",AskEngineers,rangerrick5,/r/AskEngineers/comments/pon0d/did_i_inadvertently_ruin_my_life_by_settling_on/

30,EE advice: designing a System to control a relay using a thermocouple and op amp,1329157403,"Background: I am trying to design a system to control another circuit based on temperature. My idea to do this was to use a thermocouple to measure the temperature in the area of interest, then based on the voltage that is generated (which will correspond to a certain temperature), have a relay be triggered to open when it was otherwise closed. I was thinking I would use an op amp to amplify the TC voltage and control a relay.  Also, power source for the entire system is 2 14500 AA size batteries.

FYI: my electrical knowledge is most theoretical electromagnet and information I have found on wiki or other online resources.

So I have been working out how I can make sure op-amp output would consistently have my NC relay on and off at the correct times, because looking on digikey, it is appearing that most relays (was not too familiar with them before) have max turn on voltages at whatever, lets say 4V, and then min turn off voltage around 0.5V or 0.15V.  now since my thermocouple and therefore op-amp will be outputting relatively similar voltages, ex not 0V to 4V, but a range from possibly 3.5V to 4V, it seemed JUST a relay wouldn't do the trick.

so what I'm thinking is, I saw [this op-amp](http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/TSM102AIDT/497-4081-1-ND/721000) on digikey, and it appears to have a reference output of 2.5V +- only 10mV, as well as 2 opamps.  I will use negative feedback in the first opamp to amplify my thermocouple voltage at 190C, the temperature of interest, (voltage is 7.739mV for k-type thermocouple) to be 2.5V, then have this hooked up to the second opamp in the chip with the reference voltage as my inverting input, and the output from my other opamp as the non-inverting input, then the output with a diode such that if my thermocouple is above 190C, and so above 7.739mV thermocouple voltage, and so above 2.5V first opamp output, then the output of the second opamp will be driven to supply input positive (could be controlled via negative feedback too if I desired, but I dont see a real reason for that), whereas if the temp is below 190, thermocouple voltage will be below 7.739mV, and so first opamp output will be below 2.5V, and so 2nd opamp output will be driven to negative, but due to diode no output current would flow.

this second output would be attached to a NC relay, and so would open when temp is &gt;190C

I have 3 questions about this: 

first, does the general idea of the system seem logical? makes sense to me based on my mostly theoretical knowledge, so I am wondering if in practice this still should work as I intend?

Second, is that according to [the wiki page on op amps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op_amp#Operation), and specifically operation, using negative feedback like that allows me to provide an expected output which also scales proportional to the input. now looking at [this](http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~rayfrey/431/notes9.pdf) and further down the wiki page, I think an inverting amplifier is what I need since it appears to have an output which is relative to the input (ex Vout = Vin*(some multiplying factor)) in contrast to the non-inverting amplifier, which appears to output constantly Vout=1+(fixed factor).  

This all leads me to believe I will want to have my two resistors in a negative feedback, inverting, setup.  since 2.5V/7.739mV ~= 323, I will want my resistors to have my ""Rf"" with a resistance in a 323:1 ratio with ""Rin"" (using wiki's terminology, as in [this picture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Op-Amp_Inverting_Amplifier.svg)).  so (if that is all correct?), is there a certain resistance range that would be best to use for practical reasons, since theoretically, to my knowledge, all that matters is the ratio?  otherwise, I am thinking I will get Rin as 1ohm, and then I can very the ratio very easily if I need to by changing Rf, which I can start at as 323 (or 324 likely, since that's the closest I see initially looking on digikey).

third and lastly, Im thinking ill use a relay with max turn on voltage at a bit under the minimum the batteries should be outputting, so about 2.5V or 3V, since they will be outputting between 4.2 volts and about 3V I'm told.  this make sense?  I am also thinking it may make sense to have my relay NO and have the circuit be closed while heating and open otherwise (which would be an easy enough change to make by switching a few wires around).  idea on weather NC or NO relay would be a better choice?  Im thinking it will probably depend on how much I expect the circuit to be switching, and may be something I just try both configurations and see which allows the battery to last longer.

also, just thinking, is it possible a transistor could accomplish the goal of my relay and use less power? I dont know much about transistors except that they are frequently used as switches. are there any other alternatives to relays that may be lower power consumption? I will be investigating relay minimum current for activation, since I do not know if that exists even or not.

now, before you start saying ""well so it counter acts the weight of whatever is being held up by the crane obviously"" or something like that, I realize that is probably the intention, however, if they put a counter weight on one end of the top, then when they are NOT lifting anything, the situation is the exact same as if they just had no counter weight and were trying to lift something.

So what is the point? why do they do it? is there something I'm missing or are crane builders just dumb?

58,Help me understand the thermodynamics (and physical cause) of pressure drops across valves?,1328886460,"I've been teaching myself a little thermo, and came to the concept of using throttling valves (assumed isenthalpic) to create a pressure drop. My book goes into no detail explaining WHY there is a pressure drop across valves, so I need some help.

Here's my thinking so far: 

Say we have a liquid water flowing horizontally through a throttled valve, with the inlet and outlet piping both being the same diameter. The flowrate is constant through the valve. I understand, via Bernoulli principle, that as the cross sectional area of the flow decreases in the valve, the velocity must increase and the pressure must therefore decrease. I get that there is a pressure drop ""in"" (and immediately after) the valve. 

What I need help understanding is, what happens AFTER the valve? Why is the liquid on the outlet side at a lower pressure? Why is the pressure loss in the valve not recovered when the fluid returns to the original cross-sectional area and its velocity returns upon exiting the valve if the process is isenthalpic? Where does the energy go? How could one possibly use a valve to throttle a stream from say 100 bar to 1 bar without all that energy going somewhere? 

Any light you guys could shed on the matter would be appreciated.

**Edit:** I understand that some types of valves are specifically designed to control pressure via specialized internal mechanisms (springs, diaphragms etc.). I'm talking about something like a common globe valve which is simply half way closed for example. In the words of my textbook: *""when a fluid flows through a restriction such as an orifice, a partly closed valve, or a porous plug, without any appreciable change in kinetic or potential energy, the primary result of the process is a pressure drop in the fluid""*",AskEngineers,Hubes,/r/AskEngineers/comments/pjev6/help_me_understand_the_thermodynamics_and/

62,"All the cliche questions you are probably tired of hearing, but asked much worse than normal [building a resume and why go to grad school]",1328836636,"OK, I'm bored and anxious, so I'm going to throw out a broad, stupid array of questions, that I will probably look back on with embarrassment sooner than I normally do:

So I am 25, am a HS dropout, I just got my GED, and want to be an engineer. I know doing this at all is going to be really tough, and I'm sure a few semesters at community college will answer a lot of these questions, and change my ambitions, but if you guys could humor my ridiculousness, I would appreciate it.

First, I plan to go to a two-year school, and transfer in to high-ranked program, most likely for mechanical. I have never really worked before, and clearly look like a tremendous loser to employers. So:

1) With no real resume or connections, and at my age, will I find it impossible to find co-ops and internships? 

2) Would joining things like robotics teams and FSAE teams help me with that? 

3) And also, how hard would it be to join those sorts of clubs at most schools? Do they have some sort of merit-based acceptance system, where I would find joining difficult? Especially coming into a better school from a community college, would I be shut out of participating at a better school with a lot of promising engineering students?

3a) Same questions for research positions.

Next, let's say I don't wash out. I pull my shit together, keep my grades up, get a couple internships and do some research (I know nothing about ""research,"" I just read some other people mention it, and it sounds potentially important and interesting), and end up earning a a mechanical engineering degree with a great GPA (not even sure what is considered great tbh. &gt;3.5? Depend on the school?). My next fantasy is to get an MS in either mechanical or Aerospace from MIT. My questions here are: 

4) I know this is probably a hard question to guess at, but from your understanding, could I plausibly get in like that? How much would I have to stand out, other than just good grades?

5) If so, is there much chance I would not have to pay the $40K/year, which I would rather not go into debt for? I've heard a lot of grad students get TA-type jobs and pay little, but I would assume to get that sort of thing at a school like MIT, you have to be fairly special?

6) This is an absolutely absurd question to come in this order, I know, but why would I get an MS? I read that people who go into ""research and development"" tend to need an MS, and while that sounds cool to me, I don't even know what that means. Like, how would that differ from most mechanical or aerospace jobs? (Again, sorry, I know these are different fields and my post only gets stupider. I just don't know how better to ask. To shine more light on this, I want to get my BS in MechE because I think it's probably a better thing to major in, but then I would consider Aerospace for the MS, because once I have crossed over to fantasy land, I might as well start to dream the rocketeering dream.)

My route to work has a couple paths that I can take, each to be described below. Each route has its pros and cons, so I will attempt to incorporate as much data as possible on my routes so as to create an effective idea of the length and speeds travelled. I have driven all of these routes multiple times so I know the flow of traffic, the timing of the lights, etc. so I will be putting realistic numbers and altering the traffic light count to be only lights I get actually stuck at. The total distances are not the same because the roads here do not like make sense and curve a lot. Traffic volume is compensated for in the average speed over length of travel.

**Vehicle Desciption:**

* 5 cyl, 3.5 L, Automatic 4-spd, Regular Gasoline

* 16 mpg city

* 21 mpg highway

* 18 mpg combined


**Path 1 (Freeway)**
* City: ~50mph speeds for 5 miles

* Hwy: ~70mph speeds for 8 miles

* Lights: 3, 2 minutes per light

**Path 3 (City)**

* Lights: 5, 2 minutes per light


In attempting to deduce which path is the best I have hit a wall because of the numerous other variables in the overal scheme.

84,Compressed air system questions (xpost from r/engineering),1328639235,"Hello,

I was wondering if anyone could help me out. Im designing a small compressed air system for strictly pneumatic tools. This is designed only for a shop application. The air compressor is similar to [this](http://compare.ebay.com/like/140358088001?var=lv&amp;ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&amp;var=sbar&amp;_lwgsi=y&amp;cbt=y). Rated Psi is 175 with flow at 17.5 CFM.  The main compressor feeds a main distribution line which branches out into three terminals. I apologize if this is an obivous or stupid question but I want to be absolutely sure.

1. Do i need an aftercooler/condensate seperator combo for this system? Most aftercoolers are rated at max flow @ 100 PSI. I if i got a 30 CFM @ 100 PSI would that be able to handle 17.5 CFM @ 175 PSI? Would air cooled suffice?

2. Is it ok to use a 3/4"" NPT to 1/2"" NPT adaptor for the drip drain leg?

3. [Does my Drip drain leg have to be rated high enough for my curren CFM rating?](http://www.grainger.com/Grainger/wwg/search.shtml?searchQuery=drip+drain&amp;withinSearch.x=0&amp;withinSearch.y=0&amp;op=search&amp;Ntt=drip+drain&amp;sst=All&amp;N=14927)

4. If i do not need an aftercooler, will a main line air filter suffice along with filter/regulator combos at each station?

Any help is appreciated. If this is not the correct sub reddit to post this in, please let me know. Thanks!

Obviously there is some friction in the mechanism but the exact value is not (yet) known -- I can calculate this later when testing.  I'd like my code to have enough precision that if I tell it to move the wheel, say 30 degrees left, it will move it exactly 30 degrees (say +/- 0.1 degree) -- but either as much *smoothness* as possible or in the the shortest time possible.

Is it plausible that copper pipes are prone to bursting when the warming ice inside them expands or is this just a rare occurrence or even a myth? I could imagine that many of the sudden leaks during thaws can be explained by ice plugs giving away and exposing bursts in the pipes created during the initial freezing up. Could these bursts during warming up also be cases of amateurs spot heating a weakened pipe?

Apparently all the plumbing experts in my country parrot the same fact that when frozen water pipes start thawing with the warming weather that's when most of the pipe bursts happen. They openly caution people to never try to thaw pipes themselves and the risk of a ice pressure change created bursts is given as the explanation. I've recently been wondering about the plausibility of this and searching for stuff online about frozen plumbing. There seems to be very few mentions in English of how the temperature expansion coefficient of ice is related to bursting pipes.

I've been trying to drive some steppers with control boards from SOC Robotics and I've hit a bit of a snag.  Nobody - including SOC - seems to know what I'm doing wrong.  Please: Would you recognize this mistake?

I have an Arduino sending step &amp; dir signals to an [MM160](http://www.soc-robotics.com/pdfs/MM160%20Technical%20Reference%20Manual%20R1.0.pdf) controller that drives a [NEMA23](http://www.soc-robotics.com/pdfs/SM3006%20Stepper%20Datasheet.pdf) stepper.  I am sending step commands once a second.  Every two seconds the stepper moves.  (lt seems to be ignoring every other step command.)  Every time the stepper moves it changes direction.

[Pictures of the setup](http://imgur.com/a/G4ckf)

I have used an oscilloscope and I see nothing out of the ordinary.  I am NOT changing the voltage to the direction pin.  I have tried reversing the red/blue coil to see if that helped (it didn't).

Frankly, I've run out of ideas.  Any suggestions you have to diagnose/fix would be a great help.

But just in case I have a few questions that I can't seem to answer that well.

* When Uranium is ""enriched"" what exactly is taking place? Is some of the U-238 being converted over to U-235? Or is it just the isotopic separation of the two?

* What exactly is ""critical mass""? Is this just the mass of fissile material required to sustain fission based on how many neutrons your fissile material emits? Or is it more complex than that.

* Specifically for LFTRs. If the cooling on the ""freeze plug"" fails and the fluid fuel is dumped into the drain tank and is ""passively cooled"", what exactly is doing the cooling?

23,"Microphones, speakers, and frequency response - is my understanding correct?",1328167588,"My understanding is that laptop speakers are relatively small given how loud they need to be.  As a result, they have difficulty correctly reproducing the low-frequency sound, so they are often treble-heavy and ""tinny.""

Earbuds, though, are smaller than laptop speakers.  But in comparison, they don't need to be nearly as loud.  So therefore, they recreate a more balanced sound, representing the low and high frequencies well.  

Is that right?

Now, onto microphones: all the microphones I've seen are about the same size - the size of your fist, or smaller.  Do they have any frequency response issues?  Are there certain mics that you would use preferentially depending on what type of sound you're trying to record?

If I had to mix both coffees into one larger cup, and wanted to have the highest temperature at work for a mixed drink, should I mix at Starbucks or work?""

It was claimed radiation played the largest role (due to T^3 term), so it was best to mix before. I thought forced convection (on the mug) and conduction through it would be the largest driving force. Given the 40°C would cool less rapidly than the 80°C, I thought it would be best to mix them later...

i have been assigned a project that explores the effects of extra unsprung mass for a passive car suspension system system using analytical/mathematical techniques. i will be using matlab/simulink to model the system. the quarter car model will be used because i am only studying the vertical motion of the system. i will be looking at two different passive systems. one that uses a linear stiffness coil spring w/ hydraulic damper, the other uses a non linear air spring w/ hydraulic damper. 

i have extracted the mathematical model using newtons second law of motion and will now have to model the system using matlab. i know it is possible to model the linear spring stiffness system using simulink alone but it does not facilitate the use of non linear coefficients. which  is what i need to be able to do for the system that uses the non linear air spring.

the simulation model for the system will be run for 3 different roughness profiles (,still to be provided by my supervisor) at a range of different speeds. i have to analyse the dynamics of the system, and tune the damping coefficient and spring stiffness's until a desirable response is achieved. 

i know that i just have to derive a simulation model from the mathematical model, but i do not know how to model the system using matlab so this is where i need help.

In this case, we have an external pump with filters both before and after, followed by a pressure regulator.

Does it make any difference if the filters and pumps are directly connected or not? One way to connect them is with lengths of hosing running between each component. Another way is to have the filters directly screwed into the pump inlet and outlet so that your whole assembly is a bit like one big long pumping and filtering assembly.

Is either configuration preferable? The direct connections requires fewer parts and takes up less space, but I wonder if having the parts directly connected would impede the fuel flow in any way.

 * Worked for 3 years after bachelor's
 * Went back to school to get a master's
 * Interned at a company, did well
 * Now they offer to fund my Ph.D if I work for them during my studies, would imply that I transfer to being a Ph.D student **without getting my master's**
 * --&gt; 50% I work on their stuff, 50% I get to spend on my research
 * --&gt; They would pay me ~45k/year, taxable
 * --&gt; I expect it will take me 3-4 years more to get the Ph.D compared to MS

With my master's and a few years experience, I would start with at least 65k$/yr, and that would go up quickly. I don't mind much earning less in order to get a Ph.D, but I heard that it can seriously hinder your job prospects -- that I could end up with a Ph.D and be less employable than with a master's and years of sleepless sweat and money sacrifices to get the Ph.D.

I feel I am pretty lucky to get this offer, but still I have apprehension to get a Ph.D. Everyone I know that went to get one had at least a major depressive episode and were mostly depressed during their studies. Also, when I go to a job fair, the employers are all asking for bachelor or master's -- they don't think much of Ph.Ds.

Also, I go to a decent state college, so it is not like a Harvard/Stanford/Princeton Ph.D that would open a lot of doors for jobs on Wall-Street on in business consulting.

One way I look at this is ""they pay me good money to study -- just do it -- you will get good experience during your Ph.D as well because as a fancy degree"". The other way is ""I don't expect to become a college professor, so getting the Ph.D, although it sounds cool, is not worth it -- just graduate and start working already -- you are 27"".

80,A way of joining hardened steel wires to an end of steel wire rope?,1327622373,"First let me say this is for a theater stage effect, so its mechanical application doesn't concern load bearing ratings etc, it is for artificial flowers that appear to bloom on stage.

Problem: create a flexible, collapsible set of flower petals that can retract into a tube and be pushed back out repeatedly without losing shape.

Solution: Use a Bowden cable concept into a sculpted PVC ""stem""... use music wire (thin, strong, springs back, aka spring wire) for the petal sculpture, covered with panty hoes for appearance.

Problem: How to attach flower petal sculpture to the cable?

So far I've tried solder, which doesn't want to flow onto all the surfaces (hard to get long steel wires that hot.. maybe I'll try a blow torch..) Maybe I should paint them with some kind of substance? is it acid? flux?  .. I have also tried clamping it all together with [wire rope ferrules](http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1087&amp;q=wire+rope+ferrule&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=wire+rope+ferrule&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1g-S4g-mS1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=1418l5233l0l5793l21l21l2l2l1l0l182l1700l7.10l17l0) but that is proving to be very difficult with out a machine to compress the ferrule around the assembly (all I have is vise grips, pliers, hammer etc)

Is there a type of fastener that is easier to use and can wrap everything together with a significant tightness, like some kind of clip or wrap? ... This joint needs to be thin so it can slide through the PVC tube.

Wondering if my best bet is solder.

edit: [here's a pic of the messy mockup in question](http://i.imgur.com/8Vsbb.jpg)

**update** so I tried windyplace's suggestion of zip ties and JB weld. The joining worked awesomely. Now my problem is that the structure has too much resistance to slide through the pipe. My DIY made bowden-cable style assembly has too much play causing the drive wire to ripple and push against the outer pipe wall creating friction (is there such thing as teflon tubing?), and the wire sculpture just gets crammed in there and presses against the PVC really hard.

I’ve been having one hell of a time trying to find a device, or a series of devices that I can rig together to solve a pretty basic problem at my work. I was wondering if you guys had any ideas for the device I’m envisioning for the solution, or whether you think I am approaching this problem from the wrong direction.

I am trying to find some sort of device that can hold a flat piece or anything that would be able to be traced and create a straight line (doesn't even need to hold anything if you can trace a straight line off the device). This holder and/or device (or a combination where the device moves up/down, forward/back and side to side and the holder can rotate and tilt) needs to move with 6 degrees of freedom (though I could settle for five, forward and backwards movement isn’t required, but would make the work easier). The device should be able to be finely adjusted (maybe thumbscrews or dials?) or be somewhat resistant to movement. The device could be freestanding or clampable (can’t use any sort of magnetic component because the material being worked on is titanium and thusly won’t stick to it.)   Currently the solution to the problem involves using some sticky puddy and a flat piece of metal (as seen here: http://i.imgur.com/MXiyq.jpg ), but as you can imagine, it is very hard to finely adjust the position/tilt of the metal piece to ensure its levelness.

I can provide more detail about the process if needed. I figured that if the device I described above exists, one of you fine folk would know the name of it and/or may be able to point me in the right direction.

I'm in my research stage, but wanted to have a unique project. The purpose of this post is to get a few ideas and maybe some good material to research in preparation for this project.

Basically, we have to build a small wind turbine (roughly 40cmx40cmx40cm). It will be tested inside a small wind tunnel roughly half a cubic meter large. The speed isn't outrageously high - maybe 60km/h. We can use any materials and any design, but we are not allowed to manipulate the signal out of the motor. Basically, gears are allowed, but transformers are not.

**The purpose is to get the highest voltage in class.**

This bothered me a bit because I thought that building a turbine that produces the most work would better demonstrate a student's ability to design a turbine. Anyway, my questions are as follows:

* What kind of blade design would you guys go with at that size? Anybody have some good sources to research blade designs?

* I heard somebody mention that 3 blades is the most efficient. Is this bullshit, or does it have some merit?

* Are there better options than blades to generate electricity from the wind? (ex. paddles attached to piezoelectric crystals)

* Would maximizing surface area along the blade benefit the efficiency of the turbine, or hinder it?

* Is there a commonly accepted design for wind turbines that would work efficiently on a small or large scale?

44,Negotiating an Engineer's Salary,1327016136,"Engineers of Reddit,

I'm looking for some solid advice on how to accept an offer from a company for which I've been ""interning"" for the last year and a half.  Although the offer they extended is a raise from my current pay rate, I feel it is far below average salaries for entry level BSMEs in my area (San Jose, Silicon Valley).  

I've been doing research on websites like Salary.com, Indeed.com, EngineeringSalary.com, and PayScale.com.  What I have found is that there are wildly different predictions on what I should make, here is a summary of this data:

All sites were supplied with the same information:

* Mechanical Engineer I
* 1 year experience (actually been interning at this company 2.5 years)
* 100-250 employees
* San Jose, CA
* Degree from Santa Clara University (top 20)



* Salary.com: **72k**
* Indeed.com: **101k** &lt;--- WTF? Sounds unreasonable
* EngineeringSalary: **75k** 
* Payscale: **54k**
* Homefair.com **72k**
* JobSearchIntelligence.com **68k** &lt;--bottom 10th percentile, 90k median

My current offer is for 63k which is 5k more than I make as an hourly intern.  The benefit package is just about the best you can get (profit sharing, stock purchase, even education and veterinarian)

My question is this:  How do I present this information to attempt a massive renegotiation of the offer?  I myself do not trust the accuracy of these websites and wonder if there is a better data set I can present.  Is it unreasonable to ask for at least 70k?  What do other low level experience MEs make (if you feel like divulging that info)

Any advice, experiences, data etc. is greatly appreciated, I really don't want to get screwed on my 1st offer. 

Thanks!

**edit:**  Wow, thanks for all the advice everyone.  To fill you all in, I did compile all the information from my research and presented it to my manager.

Basically the gist of the argument was that our company does not fully compensate salaries based on the cost of living adjustment in the area.  There is a small bonus for employees in San Jose ~6%, far below the COLA of about 50%.  He took my argument upwards and I ended up with an offer for 65k.  
I think the take away here is that **it never hurts to do your research and learn more about what your company will and will not do for you**  Had I just accepted I would've left money on the table and not had the experience of learning how they came up with my offer.  I'm happy with how this turned out and grateful to all you reddit engineers for giving me the courage to just go for it.

46,An optical/electrical question regarding ballistics. ,1326961968,"Last weekend I was bored, and so wandered through my local Fry's Electronics. I wound up at home with a $20 [Arduino knockoff](http://www.amazon.com/OSEPP-NAN-01-Nano-Arduino-Compatible/dp/B005SV1RC6), staring at it and wondering what the hell I was going to do with it. Then... Inspiration. 

I'm going to build, or at least attempt to build, a chronograph. The basic idea is pretty simple - two sensors - when sensor 1 is tripped start time, when sensor two is tripped stop time. Divide time by distance, spit results onto LCD. The quickest way to construct those sensors would seem to be a laser/photo resistor. 

The slightly more complicated part... I'd like to use this with my firearms, to get a better idea of how consistent my handloads are. I can't guarantee precise enough placement to hit, say, two laser beams 1 meter apart. Herein lies the problem: How do I build a sensor array capable of generating a change in voltage based on an object passing anywhere in a... let's say 3"" wide path?

Thanks!

I am a civil engineering (geotechnical focus) graduate student. Proficient at simple 2-D drawing in AutoCAD: I used it routinely as a staff engineer when I worked full-time before grad school. I routinely find myself needing to accomplish simple drawing and tasks that I resort to AutoCAD for, but I would love a better solution.

AutoCAD is bloated, expensive, and complex. It takes too long to load on my machine, and does too many things for me to take advantage of. What I'd love is a much simpler solution to gain proficiency in for my limited needs.

I know there are plenty of freeware/shareware/open-source alternatives out there, but hoped perhaps one of you could give me a recommendation. Below is a (incomplete, but representative) list of the types of tasks I use AutoCAD for. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

* Simple line drawing tools: lines, polylines, arcs, circles, extend, offset, cut, etc. Defining circles and arcs by various geometries (e.g. ""passes through this, tangent to that;"" ""3 points;"" ""1 point and center"" and so on.)

* simple fill tools: hashes and solid fills

* dimensioning tools.

* measurement tools: length, angle, polygon area, etc.

* a solid set of keyboard shortcuts is a must!

* exporting to vector graphics files would be very nice for including good-quality diagrams in PDF documents by e.g. LaTeX

* The ability to import a raster image in the background. I routinely scan maps and site plans and then draw over them. Useful for producing new engineering drawings and also measuring areas, distances etc. on scale drawings.

That's it! That's all I ever use AutoCAD for. Can anyone suggest a simpler program that has all of the above features and few others?

I have a few ideas I'd like to test out on laser gun packs like the ones used in Lasertron arenas, but the things are nigh impossible to find up for sale unless you're replacing one for an arena you work at or are buying in bulk from a surplus vendor, so the next best thing I could think of was to rely on the vast stores of knowledge locked up in the internets.

1) A more general question about lasers, meant to create a ""shotgun spread"" effect, I was wondering if a curved lens could be used to diffract a laser beam, and if so, would it create multiple distinct beams or simply spread the original laser into a conic shape?
2) Would it be feasible to attach a peripheral to a laser gun pack that allowed the wearer to switch between several preset fire rates and damage output settings? I know some user information must be tied to the individual laser gun vests, but I don't know the exact way all that information is tracked and dealt with by the main system that tracks score, hit locations, etc.
3) Most laser tag arenas I've been to offer reports at the end of the match and can tell you who you hit and where you hit them. I take this to mean that when a laser hits a vest sensor, there is some transfer of information taking place between the two vests via the laser - is this correct? Also, referencing the first question, if the laser were diffracted, would each resulting laser carry the same information as the original?

This is where a second, inverted aquarium is placed inside the other and raised up.  Air is sucked out, and atmospheric pressure pushes the bottom tank's water up into the open-bottom tank.  It's cool, because the fish can swim up in there and have extra room, and because it surprises people that the water would actually stay in there without running out.  

I understand that in the top tank, the weight of the water causes a sucking on the aquarium glass, and if there were a leak, air would rush in.  But I don't understand where the weight goes.  

If I suspend an open-bottom tank from the ceiling, would the ceiling bear the weight of the top tank's glass, or glass and water?  Alternately, if the open-bottom tank is resting on the bottom of the lower tank, is the bottom tank taking the weight of the glass in the open-bottom tank, or the glass and water?  

Secondly, I use this [aquarium calculator](http://www.theaquatools.com/building-your-aquarium) to figure out glass thicknesses for various sized tanks.

But if one could get ahold of enough hobby servos to build something of that size, would it work?  Would it be able to lift its own weight?  

Or, as I suspect, would each servo in the chain have to be capable of supporting the weight of the entire unsupported chain from that point on?  I'm sure it would be no problem for a servo to lift itself, but you'd need some pretty heavy lifting servos to lift the entire arm from the base, right?  I've seen some servos which can lift a hundred pounds, but I suspect such an arm would weigh far more than that.

On a related note, if said tentacle were something more along the lines of a snake, do you think it would be able to lift itself off the ground much like a python might to reach a low hanging branch?   I think this would be more feasible because the more vertical the chain of servos is, the less rotational force would be applied to each servo in the chain.  One servo on the end of the snake could raise itself easily to vertical, and the next servo would have to raise itself and that one, but at some point the curvature would put the center of gravity over the next servo in the chain and at that point I think things change and some of the weight would now be supported... or would it?",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/oju8x/lets_say_i_wanted_to_make_one_of_doc_ocks/

Another thing then is, like in spectrometers, they use a light source that produces a broad spectrum of wavelengths and then they select the right colour (or wavelength) with a prism (or other optical tricks). Does this also work with LEDs or do they only produce one wavelength? And what with white LEDs? They must produce a range of wavelengths? or just a couple to create the illusion of white?

Mechanical Engineer here, and I have a question about keeping tension in a chain. 

The system I'm working has a chain that does not complete a full loop. It only goes back and forth. It is required to keep the chain in the proper tension.

I'm exhausting a gas that is nearly air at about 60C and exiting a small (1/2"" diameter) orifice at around 50CFM to ambient conditions. I will have an open end duct at the orifice that plumbs about 10ft to some sort of blower, and will have a duct on the exhaust end of the blower that carries the exhaust about 150ft to ambient conditions. I'm trying to select a blower that has sufficient capacity to carry the exhaust. I'm overdesigning in the place of precision.

If I remember correctly, I should find the head loss through the length of the pipe, and select a blower based on required volum. air flow (which would be at least 50CFM?) and head loss. I've been using online Darcy-Weisbach and Bernoulli calculators in lieu of the equations that I don't have. 

Does my method seem right? Does it matter that the blower is inline? Can I assume that the pressure at the inlet is atm? I'm required to use something like corrugated plastic pipe (eg, something rough) of diameter around 3"", will have a couple of elbows.

All the other major companies making the same product line as we do have their own proprietary software to do this, and we want to join the club. 

We have found that using spreadsheets, CAD, and sticky notes are just not going to fit our needs. There are a lot of calculations we are doing in excel right now, in a giant spreadsheet. We have design templates in our solid modeling software. It's just getting out of hand. I've been asked to fix this problem.

Well, I started writing a program that handles all the design criteria, the design changes, dco/eco's, performs all the calculations we do by hand/excel. I realized I was just replacing the spreadsheet, and nothing more. I have no time limit on this project, so even if it takes 2 years to complete, so be it.

Every API, engine, SDK I've looked at so far seems to be goaled toward game development. That or it is intended to be used with native C++.

I'm going to be attending school in in the near future working towards an engineering degree. I'm going to be a post-bac with a BA in Economics working towards one of two degrees that I've been debating. I know the question above is fairly loaded and ""better"" is completely subjective, but for purposes of this discussion let's essentially define better as marketability and job availability to an oil company against financial benefit vs cost. I know looking at it financially to some may not be the best idea but they way I've been looking at it, going to school is extremely expensive (I already have a good amount of student debt) and considering the costs, it's something I have to think about. I've already done the liberal arts major that I truly found interesting, but obviously having to go back to school says something about job availability for economics degrees so payoff vs the costs in this situation is something that is important to me and a motivating enough factor to do well in either major. I've read a lot about the upstream vs downstream aspect of petro jobs, and honestly wouldn't mind working upstream (no kids/family now or planned in the near future) but the main thing I guess I'm worried about is the potential to be out of a job sometime in the future with a petro degree and no petro jobs (think about completing an eco degree immediately prior to the financial collapse). If it helps as well, going for a graduate degree at this point isn't an option for me due to my GPA from my prior BA being too low (I was an idiot when I was in school getting my first bachelors. Too much indecision, irresponsibility, and no sense of time management) although I do have a significant number of credit hours (Calc I II &amp; III, Chem I &amp; II, OChemI &amp; II and some more) so that helps either major.

I am seeking a graduate degree in Civil Engineering in Sustainable infrastructure; I come to this degree as a GIS analyst with a BS in Landuse GIS and a minor in Geology.  Because I live and love where I live in Colorado I would really like to work towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly State (more so than we already are, as every state can do better), in transportation, urban/residential/metropolitan area, etc.

I am working on trying to start my first semester of graduate classes this semester, as I have been able to finish all but one of my prerequisites, but due to this being the spring semester I find that I am a bit like two cogs that incorrectly aligned.  With this I mean that most of the courses that I would like to take this Spring are offered in the Fall, or the classes that I would like to take require a class I need to take that is again offered in Fall.  Along with my classes being a bit out of whack, I have noticed that the adviser that I have is somewhat not the best (for a lack of better words, or to be more politically correct).  I have a terrible time getting a hold of him even before he left for India before the Fall semester was complete and to the extent of talking to him he didn’t remember that he was my adviser and I am a graduate student.  

My questions are these:

1. Is the experience that I am having with my adviser normal?

2. Is my thinking and research correct that I will be able to work on planning, design, and redesign for water, energy, urban/metropolitan infrastructures with the Masters program I am seeking?

2-a. If these are not correct any suggestions?

3 . What would you do if you were in my situation?

4 . Is it possible for me to still achieve an FE and eventually a PE?

5 . What type of engineering field do you work or study?

On the software for the UPS it fluctuates between 200-240V and keeps switching off and back on continually. Is there some way I can smooth the power before it gets to the UPS? If I plug all the equipment into the generator directly bypassing the UPS it works fine, but I was hoping to keep the UPS in the loop, so there is no interruption in service in the event of a power failure. If there was some way to smooth the power before it got to the UPS that would be great, or any suggestions on what I can do would be helpful.

32,Questions on Engineering schools! ,1326063834,"Hello /r/askengineers!

I will preface by giving some detail about myself, I am a High School junior, with a cumulative gpa of around 3.70 and this year so far have a 4.0. I take all honor level classes and this year took some Advanced Placement classes. I have not taken the SATs yet, but my ""realistic goal"" is to score 1900 - 2000. I am very involved with multiple clubs, robotics in particular. I am fascinated by Electronics, sensors, electricity, programming, and robots. My fascination with these things is what makes me want to be an engineer. I also enjoy science and have been very good at it. Math has been a thing I been working on and been growing to like also. 

Now, that I gave a little detail about myself I will go into my questions. My main questions are
what major and what college. To be more specific, I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia and have very little money and my parents will not be helping with tuition as a result. This leads to me needing an inexpensive college. So, my question is where is a cheap, but good engineering college? Preferably, one were I can also live at, to get the ""college experience"" and learn to be very independent. I took a tour of Drexel which I liked and heard it has a good reputation, but it is quite expensive (25k tuition and 13k room and board) and would not be able to live there and get a college experience as a result of the price, and be a little to close to home for my liking. I heard good things about University of Pittsburgh, which would satisfy most of my criteria, but I am not sure of how renowned it is engineering wise, what engineering programs it is good with, and also if a school in the city will be the same as one that is not. The answer to this question may rely on the second question which is about majors.

My second question is about majors. The challenge, subject matter, and what engineers can do, make me know that I want to be an engineer. Yet, I am not sure what type. Computer and Electrical are mainly what I am thinking about. Software with a CS minor or double major is possible also because of how I enjoy programming and program often (in java at the moment). 

My concerns though are:

1. Aren't Computer engineers very limited and can not work on as broad of an amount of things as an EE?

2. I also heard many things about why not to be an EE, mostly because it is a flooded field, and Computer Engineering is better because it is newer and less people and more jobs.

3. With software engineering, I feel like I will not be appreciated/valued as much, will not get to work on a broad amount of things, and possibly not be needed.

I want to design and create things, think, and problem solve. I enjoy what I said earlier which lead me to narrow down to these engineering majors. I think I would be passionate about any of them if these questions were dispelled. I want to do good things and be successful like most, but I also want to be happy with my job.

Keep in mind I am a junior in High School with a limited amount of Knowledge and some-what bad writing style. I would love if people could point me in the right directions to find out the information I want to find out and possibly even answer some of the questions I posed with your knowledge/experience. I am asking for anything really to help guide me and refine my decisions on what I want to do. Thank you so much for reading, and I greatly appreciate responses.

40,What can I expect going into a Civil/Environmental Engineering college major?,1325936741,"-I'm quite new here, so please forgive my ignorance.-

Currently, I'm a senior in high school, so figuring out exactly what I want to get a degree in is still under speculation.. 

I'm wondering what I could expect in the ""average day"" in terms of work and studying, as well as what is expected of me academically (i.e. do I really have to *love* math in order to survive). I am quite good at math- right now I'm taking advanced placement calculus- but at times I do dread showing up. As far as standardized tests go, I score around the 90th percentile in math or science (whereas in English, that number is raised to 97th - go figure).

I suppose a big concern of mine is whether I'll be able to enjoy the things I love outside of school. I've heard some scary stories, mostly from my father- an engineer, about how his day went something along the lines of: ""eat, study, and perhaps sleep"".

While I do think this path would be interesting and rewarding, I'm worried that my intellectual capacity and time management does not reach the apparent demand (what the general population makes it out to be, at least).

I'd appreciate any input.

At the beginning of the competition, the four vehicles are set up at 3 meter intervals, and you start the first car. The difficult trick here is that the first car, after traveling the 3 meters has to trigger the second car and the second car has to trigger the third car and so on.

How can I build a little vehicle that will go as fast as possible in a straight line? What are some good power sources to use and what are good ways to implement them?

So, when I was a kid my dad kept bees and the most exciting part of the whole thing (apart from trying not to get stung) was the extraction process. We had a big steel extractor which is basically a big tub with an interior rotating spindle where you would place the frames of honeycomb.  There was a crank attached to the spindle and the goal as kids was obviously to see how fast you could get it spinning.  Ours was considerably more substantial, but it [looked a lot like this one.](http://i.imgur.com/33aAs.jpg)

In my daydream outside I started to wonder how difficult it would be to turn something like that into an emergency electrical generator (say to charge 12v batteries).  It seems to me you could mount a bunch of magnets, perhaps from one of those [magnetic floor sweepers](http://i.imgur.com/a6SnC.jpg) although I don't know how strong those really are.  Then attach and line the barrel with wiring.

From my (very limited) knowledge of electricity isn't this basically what you need?  So that spinning the magnets (at quite a high speed when you really get it going) would generate electricity?  I understand you need a regulator or something to smooth out the voltages..but would this work?  If so it seems like a pretty easy thing to build.

Edit:  Ok, based on the first replies:  I wasn't planning on using this to charge a cellphone, that was just how I came to think of this.   The real question is how hard would it be to build a 12v battery charger out of an old fashioned honey extractor which comes pre-built with this simple mechanical way to build rotational energy...again....I'm NOT an engineer , just a hypothetical thought I had...",AskEngineers,FirstDivision,/r/AskEngineers/comments/o6a0b/electrical_generation_idea/

My dilemma is that I still don't really know much about each focus.

I've been exposed to companies such as Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Meggitt Defense, Raytheon, and Southern California Edison. Because of what I've been exposed to, I feel like I'd be more comfortable working for a defense-related company.

Comm/Signals: I was never good at this subject but I have no problem in putting more than all the effort I can into understanding it as much as possible.

Computer Engineering: The only experience I've had with this is working with MCU's/learning embedded systems. (I enjoy this the most but I'm sure there's more to this, can anyone clarify this for me please?)

61,Searching for (industrial quality) range imaging / Kinect-like solution to detect movement above water surface.,1325775579,"Hey Engineers,

I hope someone here can help me with this one. Also, please let me know if you know a better suited subreddit or an external website to post this question at. 

As part of a Media Art collective, I am currently looking into ways to get a stable and reliable live 3D model of (human) **movements above / along a large water surface / pool**. With 3D I mean we want to know, besides the X/Y information also the height of a person, and being able to detect when someone's Z-position changes (ie. person jumping etc.). 

We're talking about a professional application here, with low-maintenance and long-lifespan requirements. 
 
I already have some experience with (hacking with) Kinects, so I first looked into those. Compared to industrial range imaging camera's (for instance the [Fotonic C40](http://www.fotonic.com/assets/documents/fotonic_c40_highres.pdf)) Kinects seem to have a very high output resolution, though this could just be a matter of up-scaling inside the Kinect. 

Also they are cheap and easy to come by, and tests above a small pool of water indicate that water movement does not really interfere with the Kinect's structured light field (which is a good thing for us). But.. I am very unsure about their stability and endurance on the long run. 
 
So I guess I am looking for an industrial quality Kinect-like range imaging camera. Though I am not sure which technique would be best to use (structured light such as Kinect uses, or Time-Of-Flight such as the [SoftKinetic DepthSense](http://www.softkinetic.com/Solutions/DepthSensecameras.aspx), or maybe even something else?). Does anybody know more about these systems? Any go-to's, do's, and don'ts? Maybe the lifespan of Kinects is awesome and I should'nt worry about that?
 
Any ideas, comments, questions are most welcome! 
Thanks so much in advance.

**some practical information**
 
- Our software will be written in openFrameworks / C++. 
- The water surface has a minimum size of 9m * 4.5m, camera range should be somewhere around 6-7m. It would be okay to use multiple camera's, as long as they don't interfere with eachother. 
- As minor waves and water splashes might interfere with measurements we have no problem with limiting our range to ± 10cm above water level.

I currently have a BS and MS in a very specific field of engineering, one where I can't really get a job doing anything else and... I don't really like my job (too much bureaucracy, yes... it's gov't).  It pays well enough, but it's very frustrating.

However... I really like programming and if I were to go back to school I'd try and get a BS in Comp Sci.  I've taken a c++ class in undergrad, some Matlab classes (and my Masters thesis used this heavily, to write a genetic algorithm for designing vehicles).  I also have used web-codes (PHP/javascript), objective c (for iphone development in my free time) and some other stuff... but that I picked up on my own.

Also: I'm in a branch of the military reserves and would continue that as supplemental income.  I could consider going full-time (student) for a shorter (academic) program.

* Are there programs out there where I could get a BS in Comp Sci part-time?
* Would I have to re-take all the core classes?
* Can I skip the BS and just get a Masters (possibly taking some BS coursework to fill gaps?)

16,Stop a pool from falling down a hill?,1324990655,"Hi Guys :) My girlfriend and I were discussing how to fix a problem we have in a house in Spain. 

The house was built on a hill about 10/15 years ago, and there's a pool out the back of the house. We can see that the pool is no longer level/horizontal, and is tilting in the direction of the downward slope of the hill. On the 'higher' side it has separated itself from the patio, and on the 'lower' side it's starting to leak a little.

I took some photos of it here: https://picasaweb.google.com/104453357431313003652/Site?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCJOz7_bul8ufvwE&amp;feat=directlink

I (who am not an engineer by the way :)) thought we could possibly dig under the lower side of the pool, jack it up until the water is level, fill the gap with concrete and let it set.

Then to prevent this happening again I thought we could fill in the area completely where that side of the pool is exposed (the small fruit trees would be removed). To accomplish this I would build a wall (which would presumably have to have very deep supports such that it can bear load laterally) joining the two 'patio' areas on either side of the pool.
Thus, this area would be filled in:
https://picasaweb.google.com/104453357431313003652/Site?authkey=Gv1sRgCJOz7_bul8ufvwE#5690787281834452050

At the furthest point from the pool to this new proposed wall, the hill drops down about 3-4m. So that's a lot of muck/soil/whatever I would need to put in there. I picture then having a patio entirely encircling the pool (which should help keep it still?), with grass or patio stones atop the new area.

22,What is the difference between Software Architecture and Systems Architecture (xpost from r/engineering),1324825900,"So I was recently presented with an interesting question... What is the difference between Software Architecture and System Architecture?

It seems to me that, even though most of the methods and techniques were developed by software architects, System Architecture is really a higher-level basis for all the same concepts.  Software architecture is simply a ""software-intensive system"", and therefore is treated differently only in the specifics.

So for example, imagine a system for a tidal power station.  
* This system is very hardware-intensive 
* You have lots of structure, moving components, maintenance concerns, etc...
* However, there is a large software subsystem dealing with telemetrics of the hardware and maintenance, and a SEPARATE software subsystem dealing with the distribution of power

For each of the two software subsystems, a Software Architect treats those systems in the same way he/she would if it were a software-intensive system (dealing with external interfaces and communication is the same).

So that being said, I know there are a lot of differences in the details.  For example, dealing with the internal interfaces of a software system has more to do with data-integrity and variable passing.  The internal interfaces of a hardware system are analyzed quite differently (structural loads, electrical loads, etc...)

However, in my opinion, the differences between a Software System and a generic ""system"" are really the same as the differences between a Structural System and an Electrical System.  Each of them differ in the details of how you analyze the interfaces, but the abstraction of functionality is really the same.

Does anyone else have anything else which might help to differentiate Software Architecture from Systems Architecture?

Edit: Found this quote from ""Evaluating Software Architectures"" from Clements, et al.

&gt; Finally we should say a word about software versus system architecture--that is, the architecture of software-intensive systems. This is a book about the evaluation of software architectures, but we often hear the question, 'Well what about the architecture of the syste, not just the software? it's just as vital.' We couldn't agree more. System architectures embody the same kinds of structuring and decomposition decisions that drive software architectures. Moreover, they include hardware/software tradeoffs as well as the selection of computing and communication dquipment, al of which are completely beyond the realm of software architecture. System architectures hold the key to success or failure of a system every bit as much as the software architecture does for the software. Hence, they deserve to be evaluated every bit as much and for exactly the same reasons.

&gt; The methods presented in this book will, we believe, apply equally well to system architectures as to software architectures. if modifiability is a concern, the methods can be used to guage the expense of making changes over the system' ofifetime; if performance is a concern, the methods can be used to spot bottlenecks and problem areas in the system as well as the software; and so forth.

&gt; Why, then, do we call it a book about software architecture evaluation? Because that is the realm in which the methods were invented, developed, tested, and matured. In the remainder of this book when we speak of architecture, you can always safely prefix it with software. You can prefix it with system depending on how applicable you feel the methods are to system architectures and how confident you are about our intuition in the matter.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/nq6u3/what_is_the_difference_between_software/

29,Rolls Faster? Cylinder of Solid or liquid Water and Why?,1324663439,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DFevwfcPE&amp;feature=watch_response_rev

TL;DR Why does the air system roll slower?

If you saw the video you see that the water rolls faster. This is due to the ice system converting more Potential Energy into rotational inertia than the liquid system. The fastest possible system would be a﻿ system that converts all the PE into linear inertia. And the slowest system would be the one that converts all the PE into Rotational inertia. However he inadvertently injects air into the system making it roll slower than the ice. His explanation for this is due to the flow of the water becoming turbulent. 

I disagree, I'm almost positive it is due to the change in the center of gravity of the system. With the air acting as a pseudo-brake. Note that it appears to travels at a constant speed.

Here is my response to his video...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvVVlB7R9CU&amp;feature=watch_response

Note: this is not a statics problem - its a physics problem complicated by hydrodynamics.

My final question is what happens if the air system velocity is increased to the point where the air is ~uniformly dispersed - Making the center of gravity the center of rotation. Would it then roll faster than the ice system that was initially at the same velocity?

34,Seeking advice on finding work,1324604271,"I graduated back in June with a degree in electrical engineering (control/robotics) in Southern California, I had been applying for work through my school website and various other sites before and after graduation but I was unable to find any job. I have over 4 years of previous work experience, but none related to my field.

After running into some argument with my dad because he thought I wasn't working hard enough since I hadn't found a real job (career-wise) yet, I left on my own to the east coast (New York) to try to find work over there late August, within about a week, I found a job with a law firm to pay my bills and I've been working there since. I have still been applying through sites, sending out my resume, and sending emails/writing cover letters but I have yet to get any calls for a job interview. I got called 3 times by headhunters/recruiters but they have yet to offer me anything, and I applied for jobs I did not qualify for and I got 2 calls from those but like I said, I didn't qualify (I only applied because people were telling me I should, but I stopped doing that because I think it's a waste of time and very misleading).  

I'm not even applying for jobs in my focus, at this point, I want ANYTHING that will pay me and give me relevant experience just so I can get my foot in the door, but still nothing. 

I am getting extremely frustrated and people are telling me I am not being aggressive enough, I need to be more proactive and call people directly, but I don't know who to call and I have no connections since I'm a first generation college student and I don't know anyone in a technical field, I just feel very lost and I never received any advice or guidance on this while I was in school. If any new graduates are on here who are in a similar situation (Have no previous related working experience) and you landed a job with no personal connection, I'd like to know how you did it because I have been following the same routine for the past 4 months and I feel like I'm getting nowhere.

35,Designed failure points: Introductory sources?,1324595181,"I'm designing an ""arm"" that is fixed at one end and has a cantilevered load at the other.  I need the arm to hold a minimum load, but fail and cleanly break away past a specified maximum load.  The idea is, if the max is exceeded, the arm will cleanly split away from the base rather than the whole thing kind of bending and warping into a twisted mess.

Does anyone have any good sources for simulating something completely failing?  I have SolidWorks 2011 Simulation and have tried nonlinear static analysis, but that only gets me up to the point where it begins yielding.  I need to see how it strains past yield to fracture, and see how the crack propagates to make sure it breaks through on the other side in approximately the right location (I don't want the crack to start at the base, then sharply turn upwards and end up leaving most of the structure still attached while dumping the load).  Should I be looking for a multiphysics simulator (Like COMSOL) to see how this thing will start tearing, and follow that tear all the way through to completion?  Does anyone have any experience with designing and simulating engineered failure points in a structure and care to offer me advice?

53,I want to make a HUD for my car.,1324390254,"Long story short, I want to make a HUD for my car.  I've been doing some research on this, but I'm not confident in my ability to actually make one of these yet.

First step was to view the wikipedia article for a heads up display: [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heads_up_display).  This makes it seem like HUD is relatively simple.  You take a source and project it onto a piece of glass and make sure it's focused to whatever distance you want it to appear in front of you.

The next step was to do some reddit searching.  I located [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/mxy83/question_about_hud_on_motorcycle_helmets/) post which discusses why no company is developing them commercially, not a lot of good information in terms of the engineering involved though.
[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/lelsh/i_want_to_create_a_helmet_with_a_hud/) post has even less information.  It's some high school students who want to make an HMD (helmet mounted display) and have no idea what they're doing.

Then it was off to Google.  I located one commercial product called ""night driver"" which apparently projects an infrared camera view onto the bottom of your windshield.  It appears to require professional installation, the product website is broken (multiple images do not load), and there's no mention of focusing distance.  This was not helpful, at all.

There's a lot of people that take their GPS unit, place it on the dash facing towards the windshield, and call it a HUD.  This is ridiculous for several reasons:  
1) The distance from windshield to apparent image is the same as the distance from windshield to GPS unit.  This places the image about 6 inches in front of the windshield, not helpful at all.  
2) Even light to moderate sun glare destroys the image completely.  
3) Hard to operate the GPS when it's lying upside down over the steering wheel.  

There was someone online making a HMD with beam splitters and ""pico projectors"", but he was none to specific as to his design.  He had some drawings (in MS paint, not technical drawings), but absent was any mention of how to focus the display properly.  His blog has not been updated in some years, I have no idea if his idea went anywhere.


Now, specifications:  
- Ideally, I'd like to project the display onto either my windshield or a flip-down or fold-up combiner.  I have access to the machine shop at my university, so I can manufacture any brackets, mounts, etc.  
- Eventually I'd like to project GPS instructions onto the display, but initially projecting anything (even some stock text) is acceptable.  Projecting my current speed would be a good first/second step, if possible.  
- Must be tolerant of moderate sun glare.  I don't necessarily need to drive straight into a sunset, but the quality of my display must not be dependent on the exact position of the sun during the afternoon.  
- Must be capable of focusing the image to approx. 50-100 feet in front of the car. *(reasoning below)  I'd like to be able to adjust the focus on the fly (with some kind of knob), but this is not required.  However, I must be able to adjust the focus without a huge amount of effort (i.e. no removing the unit, drilling new mounting holes, remounting, etc.).  
- Color projection is nice, but not necessary.  Monochrome is fine.  (Besides, the green text lets you pretend you're flying a fighter jet, and that's cool)  
- Must not cost a huge amount of money.  I have (essentially) free access to spare materials like wood, metal, and a piece of standard house window glass (I can't damage/cut it), various tools, a machine shop for prototyping purposes.  


My current idea:
Mount a ""pico-projector"" (""handheld"" projector) above my head and project it onto a flip-down piece of glass.  (Perhaps special glass. e.g. beam splitter, coated to reflect a specific wavelength, etc).  The projector will be driven by an old laptop.
However, I'm not certain at all as to how this is focused.  Can I simply adjust the focus on the lens to adjust the apparent distance to the image or is there more to it than that?  Will I need additional lenses?  I'm a mech-E student, but have a severely limited knowledge regarding optics.

Any advice or other ideas would be much appreciated.  Has anyone done anything like this previously?  In the spirit of maker culture and for the benefit of everyone I will report all progress on this idea.  All designs will be released to the public.




* My reasoning for this is that a HUD should prevent you from having to refocus your eyes to read information.  In an aircraft this is pretty straight forward, just focus the image to infinity because that's where you're looking almost the entire time.  In a car this is more difficult because you're looking at signs, the car in front of you, the car next to you, etc. all at different distances.  In traffic, above 30 MPH or so, you're going to be looking about 50-100 feet to the next car.  I probably won't use the HUD below about 20 MPH.  (If I had a budget and resources I'd incorporate an eye-tracker to focus the image onto whatever you're looking at, but this is way outside the scope of a DIY project)",AskEngineers,Rhakan,/r/AskEngineers/comments/njuhl/i_want_to_make_a_hud_for_my_car/

I have a degree in mechanical engineering, and I'm good at computers. I want to fuse these into a career I love.

Why I got a degree in mechanical engineering:

- I love the application of science
- I love problem solving and designing solutions
- I felt it was the most general engineering discipline 
- I want to be involved with something physical and ""meaningful"" as I internally define it.

I would find nearly anything related to space meaningful, though I'm not too picky at this stage.

I did some mechatronics stuff in the last year of my degree, and happily excelled at it.

Why I think I am good at computers:

* I've been programming for 10 years (I was 14 then, admittedly), and am proficient in several languages
* I understand how the Internet works and I can troubleshoot tricky networking problems
* I can write complicated software from scratch that works
* I have mastery of Linux and Windows, which probably doesn't impress anyone
* In conclusion, I am comfortably awesome at any layer of the OSI model

I fear most of my computer skill is useless in an engineering career. I could be an expert system admin, but I wouldn't be fulfilled by the position. 

I'm currently working as an HVAC technician. I am very good at it (the computer skills help a lot here), but I am not fulfilled by it. I want to design things, not fix them. Also, commercial HVAC is uninteresting to me.

First off, if you have a job in the field, can you please give a general description of what you do and (very important to me) your education level. 


Now, real questions: Why have there been few (to my knowledge) major breakthroughs in helicopter technology in the last ~50-60 years?Also, I have a semi-basic understanding of helicopter dynamics, but I am still curious why there is the need for the tail rotor on most craft. Furthermore, if there is a need for a tail rotor on most helicopters, why is there not one on double rotor vehicles like the [Ka-50](http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/row/ka-52-1.jpg) and the ever famous [CH-47 Chinook](http://www.enemyforces.net/helicopters/ch47_chinook_2.jpg)?


To get slightly more indepth, a few more questions. I'm slightly aware of the different velocities of the blades of the rotors. Why does this happen, and why does it make it so hard to design effective, fast helicopters? I've heard something about the blades coming near the speed of sound and possibly shattering, but I don't fully grasp why. Also, how does the force of the downstream of the rotors affect the flight aerodynamics of the body itself?

http://i.imgur.com/8ztNq.gif
We have a x=5mm thin aluminium wall used for dividing two air flows. T1=308 K and T2=283 K. Aluminium has a thermal conductivity of k=220 W/m,K. Assuming the wall areas are 1 m^2 we can use the equation:

1/U=(1/h1)+(x/k)+(1/h2)

to determine the overall heat transfer coefficient U [W/m^(2)K]

What are some reasonable values for the heat transfer coefficients h1 and h2? If we have these values we can calculate the heat flow Q [W] through the wall. For instance, using h1=60 W/m^(2)K and h2=40 W/m^(2)K, we get Q=U*dT=600 W.

Now say we want to put a thermal barrier coating on the hot side of the wall so that the wall temperature, Tw1, goes up by 10 K. The coating has a very low thermal conductivity of k=0.02 W/m,K. Is there a way to estimate how thick the coating needs to be to achieve this? Is there enough info to solve this, or do we need more numbers?

Say there are three features along the width of an object. Suppose someone would want to check these drawings for one of these features. Wouldn't the person reading the drawings want the feature to be dimensioned even though the length could be inferred by subtracting the length of the two known features from the width of the object? I know if I was given a drawing where I was constantly having to subtract to find the length of something I would be annoyed.

I'm 24 and currently working as a structural engineer. I currently work in Houston in the offshore oil industry. I graduated with my BS in '09 and my ME in December '10 in civil engineering, structural emphasis. I started working here in January. 

Everything is going fine job-wise, but I'm facing a rather unique predicament. I'm trans and currently in the process of gender transition. While my company is working with me and I should be able to keep working here, like many companies, the health insurance explicitly excludes trans-related health care. Because the insurance denies these medical costs, I'm looking at $30k or so in medical bills over the course of two years.

My best option would to be to find an employer that offers non-discriminatory insurance. There are a fair number. Typically they're large, self-insuring companies. A good list can be found in Appendix A (page 43) of this document (big pdf warning):

http://sites.hrc.org/documents/CorporateEqualityIndex_2012.pdf

I have the skills to do structural, general civil, facilities, and other general engineering, and overall I'm fairly flexible. I've done a lot of procurement, document control, and working with vendors in the first year I've been here, so I'm not limited to pure structural analysis.

My father was trying to troubleshoot and grain dump system using a couple load sensors and relays to automate the entire thing.

There were 2 dump pits that would feed into one main auger to lift grain up to the bins.  When the system was started pit 1's motor would run until the load sensor dropped below a certain threshold signifying that pit was empty and would switch on pit 2's motor.  After pit 2's load sensor dropped the entire system would shut down.

We were trying to troubleshoot why intermittently the relays would not switch on pit 2's motor.  The reason why this was difficult is because in the 240V configuration both sides of the relay is hot at all times as my father described it to me.  This made it difficult to determine whether the fault was the load sensor failing intermittently or a defective relay.  It was completely over my head and I just chilled for a while and watched while dad probed with a volt meter to try and figure it out.

7,Legal question re: PE exam and previous experience,1323658462,"I know I've asked questions about the PE exam before, but I have another one.

So reviewing the requirements prior to taking the exam, it seems straightforward.  Pay some money, take a law &amp; ethics exam, get some professional references, and hopefully determine a date to take the PE.

However, of my past 4-ish years of experience, I have a hunch that my previous employer of 26 months might not give the most glowing review of my experience and character.  It was my first job out of college, and I didn't take it as professionally as I should have.  None of my projects suffered for it, but my previous boss wasn't exactly the most popular person in the world, mostly because he was a bit of a dick and has no good opinion of **anyone**.

So my question is ...

Can a previous employer personally (and legally) shoot down your chances of getting approval for the PE exam by defaming your character?  That is, stating that you are unprofessional, that you didn't actually do engineering work, that sort of thing - things on the PE referral forms that would shut down your chances of taking the PE until enough time has passed to build up more experience and good references.

I am a snowmaker and I am having some difficulty with a set up I am running.

For those unacquainted we use a variety of guns, fed with water and air, or just water with a big fan.

This particular snow gun (Polecat semi-auto) is sat approx 250 vertical metres above its water hydrant. The run is approx 800m in length. It has only a water line running to it.

The set up we have is very basic, about 25 2"" hoses connected in series running up the mountain.

Obviously there is a great deal of back pressure in the system, this seems to be slowing the flow of water enough for it to freeze in places, also it blows the lines apart.

Is there any way that I could improve this set up? Can I remove some of the back pressure without losing a significant amount of water pressure at the gun.

One idea put forward has been to run relief valves off the set up in the higher portions. I am having trouble figuring how this would not cause me to lose water pressure at the gun.

Anyone know of good articles or posts online that discuss these details:

Are all old patents granted beforethe new law now untouchable since they are filed or can prior invention or prior art still be used to overide them?

What if inventor invented something before the law was passed but hasn't patented it yet. Can someone else patent it first because that would be an ex post facto law written after the first inventor already committed the action being legislated.

furthermore the new law says you can openly disclose and have one year to patent it yourself. 

Does this mean no one else can patent after you disclose because there is evidence by your open disclosure that you patented it it first.
But what happens if they write a patent between the time you openly disclose and you write a a patent if they invented independently after you openly disclosed?

What if they invented before you openly disclosed but they did not disclose but they filed patent before your year was up and before you filed? Who has presidence?

I'm exploring the algorithms I could use, and I have some ideas but I can never find the answers I want when I google the related terms. I need some layman answers from an engineer: I provide you with a (two dimensional) geometric shape, like a 5 pointed star or a square, or maybe a shape like a capital letter L. Then suppose I apply a force to a point on the boundary of this geometry. Is there a way to determine the internal regions which are stressed the most as a consequence of this force? For example with the L, if the force is applied at the top, in a westerly direction (left), then there would be tensile stress applied at the inside corner of the L, a little bit of compression at the outside corner, and some amount of shear stress throughout that general area.

I arrived at those conclusions by intuition but is there an algorithm I can use to calculate this numerically or analytically without generating a mesh and *deforming* it first? I'm okay with having to produce a mesh, but requiring me to simulate deformation before I can produce values for the stress tensor is just not feasible for a real-time solution.

I grew up at a bad high school and I don't feel like I performed my best there. I just have a passion for what I am doing that I can't ignore. So the idea of realizing one time that I may just not be capable of doing engineering is tough for me. The questions I want help with are, how can I tell if I'm smart; and what do you believe it takes to be an engineer?

62,I lack the necessary skills to make this. I'd love to get some help on this if possible. Involves CAD and machining. ,1323063635,"Hello everyone. First off, I apologize if this isn't the place for such a thing. I'm really not sure how to go about this, but here goes. 

Basically, I've been building these adjustable air valves for the last few years. I know the materials I use to build them aren't pretty- they are brass NPT parts - but they get the job done for now. However, I believe there is a much better way to design this, I just don't know how to go about doing so.

I'd like to take my idea up a notch and get these manufactured by some sort of machining company if possible. 

Here's a picture of the valve I currently offer: 
http://i.imgur.com/5nl96.png

These work by restricting the air flow until the desired pressure is reached. A ball bearing and a spring are in charge of that. After the desired pressure is reached, the ball lifts, allowing the excess air to flow past it, and then out the other port, which leads to a device called a wastegate. 

They're commonly known as manual boost controllers.

There are a few design flaws that are inherent to using prefab NPT parts. 

For one thing, I have to use a tap to change the pitch of the thread in one of the three holes.

Another issue that needs to be resolved is the length of the ""channel"" that the ball and spring fill. I'd prefer that to be longer as this would allow a wider range of control over the design.

In addition, the adjustment screw that threads into the block... it would be great if there were a way to keep that from falling out. Perhaps I could incorperate some sort of ""safety net"" that would do this.

Here is a mock up that shows the inner channel better:
http://i.imgur.com/pq5xl.png

It would be great to get some people to help me brainstorm on how I could improve the design. I do realize that peoples' time is valuable, so please don't think I expect anything for free. If you're interested in turning the intensity up on this project, just PM me and we can figure something out. I am by no means wealthy. I'm currently attending college to get my masters in management information systems so I haven't made it to the 1% just yet ; )

If I worked out a design and got it into a CAD program, what would be the next step? Can anyone recommend a company or place where I could get an actual physical prototype ordered or built?

I do appreciate any and all comments, help, and suggestions. This is something I've been wanting to do forever, but I just didn't know how to start. I hope someone can at least point me in the right direction.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and I look forward to seeing how this turns out. Take care!

I also need a little help with modeling the circuit in B2 spice. Here are my problems:

1) This is a schematic of the circuit:

http://i.imgur.com/4Oe56.png

Using a theoretical sine wave as a test input for Vi (at 1 kHz) I am supposed to determine the theoretical output for Vo1, Vo2, and Vo3 and to be honest I have completely forgotten all the relevant equations and don't have my book anymore. 

To start I calculated the gain (for a non-inverting configuration, is this correct?) using (Rf)/(R)+1 = (10k/100)+1=101.

From there I am confused if I can get Vo1 by simply multiplying Vi by the gain, or do I have to multiply the gain by the voltage at the + Node of the opamp to get Vo1? If the latter can someone please point me to where I can get the proper equations to carry out these calculations?

Then I can just do the same thing to get Vo2, correct? except this time multiply Vo1 by the gain?

Then I am also totally confused as to how to get Vo3 as I have forgotten what little I learned about transformers so any help here would be greatly appreciated.

2) B2 spice help:

I am pretty sure I got the circuit correct however I cannot for the life of me find the proper transformer, as seen here if I go to Passive components-&gt;Transformers-&gt;All Transformers--&gt;, there is nothing there, however there are a bunch of step up and step down transformers, but they are part numbers and we got ours from the stockroom with no markings on it, anyone know if this is a step up/step down? The lab manual says that there should be an option for Passive components-&gt;Transformers-&gt;All Transformers--&gt; iTransformers however I dont see that anywhere. Here is what it looks like:

http://i.imgur.com/0tsQX.png

Finally in the lab when we tested the built circuit on a breadboard we used a signal generator to make a sine wave for Vi and calculated that it should be around 60mV pp so that the output signals would not saturate. I am trying to do this for my spice results, however I do not see a signal generator anywhere, instead I modeled the voltage source as a sine wave , can someone verify if I did this right, here is a screen grab:

At the moment I use a couple of bathroom scales under the keg and just add the readings, but doing that every week is doing my back in!

Its all kept in 11gallon kegs that weigh about 60kgs when full.  In total I've got 8 different lines, so the ideal solution would be 8 pressure plates for the kegs to sit on, with a digital read out of weight on a display somewhere just above the keg.  If these read outs could be read and logged by a computer that would be amazing!

The best product I've tracked down so far is [this](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/PROSHIP-LARGE-Digital-181Kg-x-50g-400lb-Heavy-Duty-Postal-Parcel-Platform-Scales-/250891618152?pt=UK_Packaging_Materials&amp;hash=item3a6a4e4768#ht_3288wt_1102) which would do the job pretty well, although it would be really hard to get the reading from the display into a computer.  Also ideally I'd like to find a cheaper solution although this is already pretty cheap!

Is there any way of doing this using strain gauges though? The product I found uses a platform sitting on 4 load cells, but I was thinking of having a platform whose weight is transferred onto some steel bars with strain gauges on.  I'm not sure though if the readings would be linear based on weight or not?  And would they need recalibrating all the time?

72,"I'm a young engineer, a little lost on my next professional move. (MBA?)",1322980736,"xpost from r/advice

So to give a quick rundown, I graduated in spring 2010 with a Mechanical Engineering bachelors. After that I worked for about a year in two different locations (a summer internship, then starting that fall a full-time employment at an unrelated company) in construction. The job I was working was in NYC and had some ups but more downs (particularly the owner/boss), so ultimately I gave my two weeks notice and left on very good terms.

I decided to take some time off since I never really took a break during college and started working a week after graduation. In that time I basically decided I want to get a masters and now is the best time to do it (no serious financial issues, no wife/kids to take care of).

My biggest problem is I don't know what I want to study. I wanted to work a bit after undergrad to try and narrow that search down and I did but only so much. I'm afraid of picking something that is too specific and then not wanting to work in that field forever. That leads me to a recent thought I've had which is to look into applying for an MBA program, as I think it might leave me with something more universal for whatever field I decide to get into.

Basically to summarize myself, I naturally seek leadership positions (president of fraterntiy, president of university student government, now on my national fraternity's eboard) but I also have a great passion for creating. Because of the latter, I've always said I wasn't interested in learning econ/business type stuff because I don't want to get stuck with a complete desk job. I ended up with one anyway in my construction engineering job so I have come to some realization that what is more important is work that is interesting. I still though view it in a sense that I want to feel directly responsible for the design of the company's output (whether it be a building, a manufactured product, etc)

So I guess I'm wondering what doors an MBA could lead me to and what it could not. Would going for an MBA along with my BS in Mechanical Engineering leave me with a diverse combination that I could pursue any number of fields with? Or would it set me up for a specific type of work? Are there other options I should consider?

Any advice / past experiences is appreciated, thank you!

74,Assistance with button cell vs. AAA battery power for a school project.,1322971773,"I'm currently working on an autonomous car project for an intro to design course that requires us to build a wheeled vehicle that follows a specific path that at the end of the path will fire a payload at a target. Part of the perimeters of the project is that we can't use lithium power sources and nothing beyond 3V.

I'm to the end of the project (I've essentially adapted our required gearbox/motor to using Lego's as my construction material) and I'm trying to maximize the part of the formula our teacher gave us that will be used to grade the performance of our vehicle for the efficiency of our vehicle is a mass ratio of weight of the vehicle to the weight of the energy (battery) source. Instead of using 2 AAA batteries I'm trying to use two Alkaline button cell batteries (hooked up in serial configuration by stacking one on top of the other) of equal voltage, but yet not getting anything near the necessary power to turn the motor to drive the car. My skillset doesn't really extend to electronics as much as I would like and was hoping someone could help me with why these button cells aren't working. I've tested my battery holder and observed a voltage of 3.02V for the button cells.

I'm planning on installing baffle channels inside the box. The fan is on the inside pulling the air into the room. Paint? is flat black BBQ paint the best? What is the best barrier?

Edit1; From my research I've come upon a low iron tempered float glass that's 3mm thick with a transmissive rate of 91% compared to a rate of standard tempered float glass with a rating of 83%. So the low iron will be the best BUT I'm waiting on a cost quote to see if the increased efficiency is worth the increased cost. For a 3'x5' panel regular tempered is $180 US approx. I'm waiting on the quote.  If it's more than 10-15% more it's not worth it, as the added efficiency isn't worth the 20 years to recoup the cost.

8,Nozzle Problem for you Aero Guys,1322672519,"I don't know if it's just been too long since compressible flow classes or not, but I seem to be stuck.
I've got a problem where I have two restrictions in a 2"" diameter pipe.
Flow flowing in 1 end at .816 kg/s, Po=930 kPa, To=680K. First restriction is of variable area, then it's back to the 2"" diameter.Second restriction is a fixed diameter of 1.296"" , and then venting to infinite area/ambient pressure of 53 kPa. 

If we're looking at it as adiabatic/isentropic flow just for simplicity sake, it's easy enough to calculate A*, if the nozzle were perfectly designed for that mass flow, and the resulting mach number (2.82) in the downstream section before the second restriction. 

My question is - what is that first restriction never goes down to A*. Would the shock not develop then, and the flow wouldn't go supersonic? Just accelerate slightly through the restriction and then decelerate once it's back to the 2"" pipe?  

edit: OK, finally getting straight answers out of the ""engineers"" in charge of the program. How people who have never worked outside of hydraulics think they can handle bleed air is beyond me, but that's a different problem.

First of all, the mass flow isn't fixed, it's an available range. In most cases the first restriction is actually reducing the mass flow through the entire pipe, with the excess continuing on through the turbine. 
At the full-go position, I've got 930 kPa air @ 683K. (Stagnation Conditions both). I'm supposed to find the first restriction area that causes a static pressure of 218 kPa upstream of the second restriction of given area = .000851m^2, in the 2"" diameter section. The way I'm going to view the problem is as if I've only got the one restriction. Basically a 2"" pipe being reduced to 1.28"" diameter, being fed air at the given pressure and temperature. I know the goal P/P0, which will give me a corresponding A/A*. A* gives me a mass flow. That mass flow will then define the opening at the upstream restriction. At least at the moment, that makes sense. And it sounds like a damn exam problem from Aero 561 - Compressible Flow.

[The cool COM based thermo](http://www.riccibitti.com/pc_therm.htm)

[On that page is referrenced to a USB powered thermo](http://www.riccibitti.com/pc_therm/usb_pc_therm.htm)



But I would like to completely use the USB and get rit of the COM, how would I change the schematic? I asume i will have to make use of the D+ and D- datawires from the USB. Should I connect those to the DS1621 with 2x 4700 ohm resistors in between? I asume i would still need the nFcapacitors and the zener diodes, because of the USB power.




That would mean my parts list turns out to be:

* 2 x 5.1 volt 1/4W zener diodes (1/2W and 1W diodes are OK)
* 2 x 4700 ohm resistors
* 1 x 100 nFcapacitors
* 1 x DS1621 or DS1631 digital temperature sensors
* 1 x TYPE-A USB plug (from a USB cable)

22,"I need help, any ideas?",1322583445,"So this is going to sound... well stupid and most of you will just say suck it up but please try to understand.

I'm in first year, and since I can remember I have had problems waking up in the morning. In high school it was not really a problem because I always had my mom to rely on. In grade 12 my parents split so I would miss first period because my dad had more of the ""kid has to learn"" mindset and so for second semester I took first spare. Even with the extra hour or so of sleep I could not wake up so I started to literally blast an alarm from my 5.1 surround computer speakers, and although my dad got pissed I told him it was this or he could wake me up. This helped as long as I got a reasonable amount of sleep (8 hours or so which is hard for me).

I could even sleep through this super loud alarm that probably woke my neighbors up (no exaggeration), but the fact that I went to my computer to turn it off meant facebook and reddit were right there, so this worked for a while.

Before I knew it, I was somehow sleeping through this alarm, and most mornings I would wake up 2 hours late, realizing I must have turned it off while not being fully awake enough to realize I need to stay awake.

Now I'm in uni, with a room-mate. Unfortunately he gets pissed just from my quite phone alarm, and even though every night I tell myself tuition isn't worth a happy room-mate, I still for some reason rush to turn the alarm off in the morning before I'm really awake because I guess I feel really guilty.

I have tried alarm clocks that roll around in the morning but I started to turn them off before they got too far away from my bed, and if I started them far away, it wouldn't be loud enough to wake me up.

I cant use my 5.1 surround and blast anymore because room-mate/neighbors in residence.

The one answer I always here : ""go to bed earlier!"" well.. I have tried! I have tried sleeping for intervals of 1.5 hours (REM sleep cycles), and tried getting 9 hours of sleep, but being in engineering, the 12 hours of sleep I need (what I usually wake up after without an alarm on weekends) just isn't reasonable. 

I have considered completely switching my sleeping schedule so that school is at the end of my day instead of the beginning, but I can't because of a night class at 7-9:30 on Tuesdays. Also I would literally have no social life then since I'm asleep when everyone else is awake.

I have missed way to many classes and my marks are really starting to show it! 

Please help me lol

Tl;dr: Cant wake up in the mornings tried almost everything, marks are starting to drop, class attendance is almost at 50% as of last week and since I have missed so much class, I wont be getting much sleep before finals since I still have to learn everything.

Edit* I guess I posted in ask eng because i wanted to ask if many people skip a lot of classes? Or if anyone else has any clever ideas to wake up, and finally because engineers are problem solvers and maybe you can think of something.. One idea I had was to build a sound proof box around my head when I sleep with my alarm speakers inside or something.. aha idk! I'm seriously desperate.

We've currently got two potentiometers connected, and there seems to be a problem with the daisy-chaining (the behaviour is quite erratic). So there were a few things I'm not very clear about:

- What form should the data be sent in? We're currently trying to send an address byte followed by a data byte for each of the four channels on each chip, by sending the data for the second chip first and then the first one. Finally the chip select input is pulled high to load the data. I'm not sure if we are perhaps supposed to concatenate the bits together or something, and maybe if the data for each channel should be loaded separately?

- I'm a bit unsure about whether perhaps the problem is likely to be with the clock signal - if so, could anyone please explain briefly how does one change the clock period in arduino coding?

My brother and I like to come up with impossible ideas, and then ridicule the other for how silly the idea is. I liked this one, probably not possible, but maybe... It is also possibly a really old idea but maybe this could be a novel variation.

Background:

* The closer you get to the sun, the more ""photons"" travel though each 1 m2 surface section (with normal towards the sun), mostly (?) because of the inverse square law.

* The idea of putting solar mirrors in space to reflect sunlight to solar power plants is  probably old, the benefit is dubious, it will have to pass through the atmosphere anyway.

The idea/variation:

* Given the inverse square law if you put a solar mirror close to the sun you may actually catch a lot of (how much?) sunlight. By converting the diverging light of the sun to a focused beam of parallel light (""giant lazer"") you may be able to transport it back to earth with little loss.

Relevant questions:

- How much light is lost from sun to earth due to divergence and how much is lost due to obstruction or other phenomena?

- How much energy can be acquired per surface area close to the sun? How much can known reflective materials take? Will it be possible to focus and manage a useful amount of light or will the materials brake down? 

Known objections and response(s):

* The solar wind will blow the sail/mirror away. -&gt; It should be possible to adjust position primarily by speed of orbit and secondarily by adjusting the size of the sail.

50,The most ridiculous first-year engineering project ever. Any ideas or help is greatly appreciated. ,1322098597,"This will be a slightly long read, but any advice or ideas from you guys would be great.

The general idea of this project is to move items (wooden block, dice, dime, and a 2 dollar coin) from one side of the table to the other.

Simple concept, but a ridiculous amount of constraints are required that make this project seem impossible. Nobody from our lab knows what they're doing, and this project has **never** been done before - not by our professor, our TAs, or students from the past. We're basically the guinea pigs for this project, yet the professor is making this worth 25% of our grade.

The link for the project explanation/requirements is [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3b3sZmmb6FGODRiODc4ZmQtMDYyNy00MjY4LWJiY2MtMjUwMTVkOTBhYzky) (you only need to read pages **2** and **3**)


-----------

TL; DR
If you're too lazy to read through the two pages or click the link, I will summarize some of the basic constraints here:

* The items start in a randomized order on top of a cup. 
* There is a barrier about 8 inches high near the middle of the table which cannot be touched. 
* The items must end on top of another cup which is on the other side of the table, but this time they must be on top of the cup in a specific order- wooden block on the bottom, then dice, then two dollar coin, then dime)
* The wooden block must touch both sides of the table before it ends on top of the cup.
* The dice only needs to touch the second half of the table, but must do so for 5 seconds before it ends on top of the ending cup.
* Entire system must be **wind powered**. We are allowed to use a wind turbine that we built from a previous project. I think battery powered systems may be allowed. But seeing as how our budget is $40, we're not expecting anything fancy. 
* No human intervention except at the very beginning. The human intervention is to essentially start the system. Once the system goes, no more human intervention is allowed.
* System  must complete objectives within 90 seconds. 25% grade reduction if system takes longer than 120 seconds.

We are to design a ""smart linkage"" employing inflatable kevlar bags to lift heavy rubble after a natural disaster or such.
Our group has found a LOT of research on Urban Search and Rescue  (USAR) techniques and other related uses for these rescue bags, however, we are a bit ""stumped"" when trying to justify using the bag other than for it's intended use; stick bag under heavy shit, then prop said heavy thing up with wood. 

We designed a sort of scissor lift with a tapered near-pointed end that could be rammed underneath the rubble then inflated and presented it to him, however, it did not seem to be that he wanted. He suggested that we try to design a linkage that would be placed on top of the rubble and then could be attached with cables, inflated, and would lift the rubble (pretty much impossible unless it is attached to another, more steady piece of concrete... pretty bad idea to me).

So we are back to the drawing board and are looking for suggestions on possible linkages or ideas on how to go about this.

however, we are having some trouble analyzing the transfer of heat from the combustor to the coolant. When examining the flame + the heat given off, is it as radiative or conductive? Or is there another branch of heat transfer dealing with flames that we don't know about?

86,Welded Joint Analysis,1321753987,"Hi reddit!

I'm a Mech. E. student. I need your help for a semester project in one of my classes.

We are to design a bike, preferably with welded joints. The professor said he would go over Welded Joint Analysis in one of the next few lectures. But I have a pretty free weekend right now, so it would be great to learn the material now.

How are forces and moments resolved in Welded Joints? 

I know how this works with Pin Joints and Collar Joints. Intuitively, it seems that Welded Joints should transfer x, y, and z forces, and moments. Am I right in assuming this?

If this is not the case, can anyone guide me to a book or online resource that explains force/moment resolution in Welded Joints?
Or, can anyone just explain it here?

Here's my question: What would be -really- cool would be to somehow bias the output so that when any audio came from the radio, it would squelch the audio from the ipod so you could clearly hear the radio.

3,would it be feasable to use the sea to cool coastal cities? (more inside..),1321533363,"take a developing city like dubai for instance.

would it be feasable to send  pipes into the deeper water off the coast (at 500 metres it would be 8 degrees celcius), and and draw the cold seawater into onshore heat-transfer stations (basically big radiators). these would be linked to a grid of freshwater(or oil) pipes that run below the surface of buildings,streets,...etc. and through centralized AC systems.

this would cool the urban environment AND draw the moisture out of the air to be collected (imagine a buildings surface like a cold coke can on a foggy morning).

i'm sure it would be incredibly expensive to set up, but it would (somewhat) offset the initial costs of building energy/desalination plants that would power all the AC's and provide enough water for the city.

also, for a city like dubai where the temprature averages 110F for most of the year, wouldn't the drop the ambient temperature be noticable?

In the past my boss has given bonuses around Christmas time, and they have been quite substantial. I believe he gave the past project engineers $1,000 to $5,000. My question to you is, would it be ethical to accept this bonus and quit shortly afterward? Personally I am lost in this matter. I think that I shouldn't accept the bonus however others have told me that I've earned it. This could make up for the low pay that I receive. ($45,000 salary)

TL/DR: I've worked hard for the last 5 months and if I were to stay with the company then I would take this bonus, but because I plan to leave I don't know what to do. Also being in Hawaii is different because everyone knows each other and that also is significant.

Also I would like to have variable speed, any ideas on what my best option for this would be? Maybe a cheap motor controller or a potentiometer? I am an ELE student right now and I would love to try and design a motor controller maybe, would this be feasible? (financially and technically)

TL:DR What would be a faster more efficient or less energy straining way of heating the water in a tabletop dishwasher.

Edit:The heater is only 70% efficient due what I can only assume is heat loss through conduction to other surfaces. Not all the heat produced is entering the water it is also conducting to a metal plate at the base of the element into other parts of the dishwasher.

1. Simple - why is omega measured in 1/T? Wolfram says it's radians/sec. 2pi radians = pi(D/2 - d), so shouldn't the dimensions be L/T?

2. What does non-repeating variables mean? I thought it meant you choose the minimum number of variables that satisfy n number of dimensions you have in your answer. But both pressure and d have length in them so why would it say ""Choose d, Q, dP and mu as non-repeating variables""?

I am an undergraduate doing a masters. The course at my uni is quirky in the fact you apply to do ""engineering"", and do completely general engineering for two years and then in the third and fourth year you pick modules.

Basically the modules you pick determine the title of the engineering course on your degree when you graduate. You have to pick ten modules a year, of which six must be in your chosen field (so its pretty flexible).

I have a pretty good idea of the modules I want to take. The dilemma I have is that these modules overlap (ie module A is acceptable for both title B and title C), and therefore qualify for multiple degree titles.

I can only select one title obviously and this is what appears next to my MEng. My question is, what is the best one to choose and why? Or is it superficial?

Titles:

* Information and Computer Engineering

* Instrumentation and Control

All are accredited by the IET and the Institute of Measurement and Control. (UK accreditation)

To give you some more personal information, I am interested in control/systems/computer engineering and possibly merchant banking.

Things I am concerned about:

* How difficult it sounds
* Words with bad connotations (for some reason I don't like the word ""information engineering"", it sounds a bit script kiddy, although I assure you the classes are very involved / I also don't like the word ""instrumentation"" but do like ""control"")
* Easily recognised and appreciated by recruiters (electrical / civil / mechanical etc are recognised well. Would I get tired of explaining what is actually in my degree with for of the titles?)
* Is one field growing more rapidly / more sought after? And another overflowing?

RE-EMPHASISE: I AM NOT ASKING YOU WHAT CLASSES TO TAKE, JUST YOUR OPINION ON WHAT YOU THINK IS THE SHARPEST DEGREE TITLE

5,A question about thin airfoil theory,1320301357,"I have degrees in physics and pure mathematics, and have been reading John D. Anderson Jr.'s ""Fundamentals of Aerodynamics"" to learn a bit more about one of my favourite activities: flight.

In particular, right now I'm interested in the velocity distributions on the surface of a thin symmetric airfoil. Anderson gives the vortex strength for such an airfoil as:

    \gamma(\theta)=2\alpha V_\infty\frac{(1+\cos(\theta)))}{\sin(\theta))}

Further, he shows elsewhere that:

    \gamma=u_1-u_2

i.e., that the vortex strength equals the difference in tangential velocity between the top and bottom surfaces at that point.

If I understand correctly, going from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the airfoil, `\theta` varies between `0` and `\pi`. For `\theta` equal to `\pi`, Anderson shows that `\gamma(\theta)` is equal to zero--thus, the solution satisfies the Kutta condition. However, as `\theta` goes to zero, it appears that `\gamma(\theta)` goes to infinity. This would seem to imply that the velocity difference at the leading edge of the airfoil is infinite, which it clearly cannot be.

So here is my dilemma. I had an interview today that I thought went decently well and I think there's a decent chance I may get the job. Problem is, I'm not really interested in the work. At all.

Its just intimidating to think that my first job will be an actual engineering job and I'm afraid of how I would perform there because of that and my general lack of experience in the work environment. 

That's option A and here is option B. I could decide not to co-op, take a slightly lighter load next semester (I would have to, not really my choosing) and work some crap job at somewhere like Kroger. This does a couple of things. For one it, it allows me to still graduate in 4 years, which is definite plus in my book. And it also simplifies my class schedule quite a bit (things will get hairy if I co-op).

Currently I am highly proficient in Solidworks, and Matlab, and learning new software is rarely a difficult task for me. 



If its relevant, I have had both professors previously, and I enjoyed both of their classes despite them being polar opposites. Currently I am leaning towards wanting to do Pro-E purely because I know the work load will be at least an order of magnitude less than the Ansys class and my schedule next semester is already going to be hell (from what I understand the Ansys professor requires any equations and results to be checked by hand in order to get any credit). The flipside, is that I know Solidworks, so Ansys would probably be better use of my time in college because going from Solidworks to Pro-E shouldn't be too difficult.

However, I am concerned that since the organization is related to ending the prohibition of cannabis that I may be potentially shooting myself in the foot since I am aware that DuPont is a rather conservative company.  

If I keep it on my resume, I have a relevant leadership example that I am proud of; however I will potentially red flag my self.

If I do not put it on my resume, I don't get to bring up my experience, even from an administrative perspective independent of the actual political aim.

I am trying to determine the required coefficient of damping for the constraint scenario of a 3ft free fall and a maximum suspension travel of 4 inches. This will allow me to determine the require maximum aperture size for my design. 

The differential equation of motion for the mass-spring-damper system[(picture)](http://i.imgur.com/HsooV.jpg)
 at impact is..
     
     M(d2x/dy2) - k(x) - c(dx/dy) = 0.............................(1)

However for fluid flow through an aperture, the damping actually follows a V-squared relationship. So eq(1) becomes..

     M(d2x/dy2) - k(x) - c(dx/dy)^2 = 0.........................(2)

I know that...        x-initial= 0     v-initial= v0 (impact velocity)
                          x-final= 4in      v-final= 0

&gt; According to [this manual](http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/roadside/jumpstart.pdf), one should ""Locate an unpainted metal part of the dead car's engine, away from the battery and connect the unused end of the black (negative) cable to this location.""  
I understand it should be unpainted because the sparking could discolor it a bit when attaching it, but why do you attach it to a metal bit instead of just attaching it to the negative terminal on the battery. What negative outcomes could occur if you did attach it to the negative terminal?

What seems to be the [best answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lsjyf/when_jump_starting_a_car_why_do_you_attach_the/c2vjjb4): 

&gt; It's because lead acid batteries produce hydrogen gas when they charge. If the hydrogen contained in the battery case ignites, the battery will explode and spray acid on you. When the last connection is made with the jumper cables and the circuit is complete it will usually produce a small spark. This also happens when you break the first connection when removing cables. You want to make that last connection away from the battery so the spark doesn't ignite the hydrogen.

I'm currently working for a firm that, while international, has few opportunities for advancement for engineers.

The job is easy and I like it for the most part.


Yesterday I got a job offer from a chemical behemoth.  I would have to relocate about 2 hours away, but I don't really have anything keeping me where I'm at now except for a few friends and a job.  There wouldn't be any relocation assistance provided though, since this is not a management position.  The pay would be $52k + a yearly bonus guaranteed to be at least 10% (so I'd be making $57,200), 2 weeks vacation, and an automatic 5% contribution to my retirement fund plus matching up to 10% if I contribute 10% as well.

70,Electrolysis of water: need help in removing water vapor from the resultant gas stream,1319600799,"So I am doing some tinkering with a hydrogen and oxygen generation cell that uses the electrolysis of water to produce the two gases.  

This is not a homework problem.  IAmA retired ME who has been out of touch with the latest technologies for at least 23 years.

I am using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the electrolyte and am putting ~15 Amps via a 12 Volt DC line to produce the two gases at about 2 PSI with a flow-rate of about 1 liter/min of the H2/O2 mixture.  I am also doing this inside of a closed and sealed/insulated generating ""cell"" and it is getting hot enough (125-150 F) to produce water vapor that is being sent out along with the H2 and O2 gases.  Unfortunately, this water vapor also contains traces of the sodium hydroxide which then exposes down-line equipment to corrosion.  Yes, I know, NaOH is not an ideal electrolyte.  NaCl produces chlorine gas, which is not good, so I am also trying out sodium bicarbonate and potassium carbonate as alternative electrolytes.

What is the best way to remove the water vapor from the stream and do it in such a way as to make the water removal and disposal automatic?  All I care about is getting clean and dry H2 and O2 from the unit and don't care if the water vapor is lost.

I've tried dessicants, filters, etc. and I can't seem to find a fool-proof solution to rid this stream of the water vapor.

Money is a motivating factor in this decision.  It's not the biggest but I still can't ignore it.

But a part of me feels stupid for quitting a perfectly good salaried job during a huge recession. 

And about what to major in, I have a BS and MS in chemistry and I checked with a school I'm looking at.  I'd have pretty much all of their lower division and a good chunk of the upper electives taken care of for a materials degree.  So pretty much just the core classes to take.

I'm a lowly computer scientist, but in an area that shares a lot in common with what engineers would call signal processing (namely, machine learning). I figure that what I'm looking for must exist but I'm ignorant of the terminology, making Google search futile.

Basically, in order to find the least squares solution to Ax = b, you solve the normal equations x = (A^T A)^-1 A^T b, using a Cholesky decomposition or an SVD to solve the system, etc.

Suppose we replace matrix multiplication by A with a (discrete) convolution by a filter G. Is there a similarly simple form for the least squares solution for x to G * x = b? Since convolution is a linear operator, I figure there ought to be (since you could just write out the thing as a matrix-vector product with a particularly bizarro matrix).
