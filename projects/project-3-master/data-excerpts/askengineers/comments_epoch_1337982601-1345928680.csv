I am looking for the literary value of Uniform Elongation for Aluminium to compare with the value I yielded being 0.0422 (units?). I am not really sure how to go about finding this, I have tried google but have gotten nothing. This was put into the report to help in finding the value but I don't understand how they relate:

*Note: You are unlikely to find values of uniform elongation for specific materials, but should rather look for strain hardening exponent from which the uniform elongation can be calculated.*

Furthermore, I can't find the exponent either. Additionally, using CES2011 I have the %UE for Aluminium as 1 - 44%, is there a way to figure it out from this?

10,Optics: Using a Microscope to focus light,1345836729,"I would like to use a set of lenses to focus light from a bulb down to a fine point.  I know in principle a simple magnifying glass will work but I would like to have the light focused to a very small spot.  To that end I think I could focus the light into the eyepiece of a microscope and have the optics of the scope focus it even further to a fine point.  Before I go buy a simple microscope and test it out I would like to run it past someone else.  Does this seem like a feasible idea?  Thank you for your time.

*Edit*

I think I need to focus the light down to about 1/4 mm in diameter.  The purpose I am thinking of is using the focused light to heat solder up on a small (~2 mm square) microchip.  I am trying to help a friend out with a micro-controller art project that would require using a single uC to control an RGB led.  The hitch is that it needs to be absolutely as small as possible.  To do this I am thinking of using surface mount devices soldered directly to the uC, sans any PCB.  My first inclination would be to use a reflow method if I was using a circuit board.  So the idea would be to use reflow solder to stick the components together, align them under the microscope, then shine a light through the eyepiece to focus the light on to the solder to melt it.  My thought would be to use a halogen bulb focused to the eyepiece with a magnifying glass or some other lens.  I might be able to do this with a super fine tipped soldering iron, but I don't think I have steady enough hands.  As for power I would be happy if it could focus down to 30W per .25 mm^2.

11,Drive &amp; Driven Gear,1345814335,"(full disclosure, this is for RC car hobby... not any kind of educational or otherwise important engineering thing)

So I read this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_ratio

The RC cars that I race have two gears.  A pinon and a live axle ""Spur"" gear.... or really final gear.  

Anyway, there are SO many gearing options out there, you can achieve the same gear ratio by adding teeth to either gear.  

My question is what is the impact (torque or load or otherwise) to changing the tooth count to the drive gear vs. the driven gear?

Thanks.  


EDIT: Updated with a real-world example.  
everything I run is 64 pitch, yes the shafts can be moved closer or further apart.

for example 84 Driven, 31 Drive is = 2.71  
and 76 driven, 28 drive  = 2.71

I rounded.

12,Applied physics: Wear on Motorbike brakes,1345796686,"Hi Ask Engineers, ask science told me to try with you guys :)

Something that I have been wondering about for quite some time and was hoping i could finally get an answer.

So motorbikes havetwo different brakes on them: The front brake and the back brake. When braking on a motorbike, the preasure on the front axis is increased while the back of the motorbike is lifted up. Meaning if you would brake fully with both brakes, the back wheel would lock up and slide over the asphalt. If you have a light enough motorbike and brake enough with the front brake, you might be doing a wheely on the front wheel.

Due to the increased presure on the front wheel, the front brake is usually considered ""more effective"" and is the primary brake.

What I have been wondering:

If I would be braking from, 50kph to 0 in 200 meters, and do that 1000(10000) times, and one time only use the front brake, the other time only use the rear brake, whould they have different wear on them? Ultimately the movement energy that is reduced is the same in either case.

The second part of the question:

If I have to stop at a red traffic light in 200 meters, does starting to slowly brake immediately or doesl fully braking at 50 meters left wear the brakes more? As above, the energy reduction is the same. (Obviously not taking into consideration downshift-braking or slowing down due to the normal friction and so on)

And obviously this is not for real world use. I will not start only braking with x because it would wear 1% less, saving 2 cents / year in the process.",AskEngineers,Gandzilla,/r/AskEngineers/comments/yqtyh/applied_physics_wear_on_motorbike_brakes/

15,"Trouble with resonance equations, finding resonant frequency and Q but without capacitance",1345780768," I'm studying electronics as part of upgrading for work and I thought the chapter on resonance was going to be a breeze, reading through it was fine, as was the previous chapter on reactance. The equations or more to the point the lack of equations and values is what's stumping me.

 Can someone give me a clue how to determine resonant frequency but without knowing capacitance?

 For example here is one problem I need to solve, a series circuit:

    Resistor = 640 kOhm

    Inductor = 35H

    e = 550V

    Find the bandwidth (BW) = resonant frequency fr / Q factor

 To find the resonant frequency fr=1 / 2pi sqr root LC but I don't have capacitance.

 To get capacitance C = 4pi^2 fr^2 L but again missing one value this time frequency

 Q = 1/R * square root L/C but I don't have Capacitance  

 I'm going in circles.

 Any help or a nudge in the right direction would be appreciated. It's probably so stupidly simple it's in front of my nose.

 Thanks.

**EDIT:** Apparently it was a parallel circuit too, not series.

 The instructor responded:

 *The last relationship solves for Bandwidth using only inductance and resistance values. It is based on the relationship relating bandwidth to the ratio of resonant frequency to the Q factor of the circuit.*

 *When Q is greater than about 2 or 3, for a parallel resonant circuit, or less than 1/2 or 1/3 for a series circuit, certain simplifying assumptions can be made. The bandwidth can then be given in terms of resonant frequency and quality factor using the following formula:*

BW = fr / Q                                    

The half- power frequencies are approximately given by:
f1,2 = fr +/- R / 4pi L

More precisely,
f1,2 = [ square root (R/2L)2 + (2 pi fr )2 +/- R / 2L ] / 2 pi

and the bandwidth is:
BW = R / 2 pi L

This is definitely a question that has been asked before, and it's a subject of my ongoing research before going back to school. Right now, my main target is a degree from a nearby top ~10 school in Civil, with a specialization in Environmental. However, I've seen that people can approach the Environmental Engineering discipline from two chief backgrounds, Civil and Chemical.

My main question to you all is: do you have any experience, whether from school, workplace, or in the field, that would be useful in differentiating the kind of things someone would *actually* do with their career based on the foundation they started with (Civil/Chemical)?

Ultimately, I think I'd like to become an ecological engineer, which is barely even a field yet. I want to optimize the ""built"" environment (Civil?), whether a city, landscape, or region, for the benefit of people and the planet. Things like utilizing cascading effects - plant a tree, the tree cools the area, sequesters water and carbon, improves air quality, provides habitat for other plants and animals, and depending on the tree, it could maybe even provide food or medicine itself. I am hugely inspired by the *Dune* series, especially the ""planetary ecologist"" Liet-Kynes.  

My main concern with the Civil-based approach stems from worries from the common oversimplification, ""Civvies build bridges."" The work I want to do is, at best, metaphorically a bridge, though!

Also I've been looking back at the three motnhs I've worked here and I am a bit worried if I do ask for a reference if they will have anything good or bad. I'll point out the reasons why I think they might make a bad reference or not.

The reason for this is because I wasn't allowed to do any calculations or math. My primary duties were to draw/modify existing schematics and blueprints, write out final reports, and random little things like organizing files and renaming files. So I had a problem, I was getting really bored at work waiting for someone to give me a job. I should also mention that everyday in the morning I'd ask my mentor and manager if he has work for me, but they'll say they don't at the moment.

At this point I discovered reddit from friends and that's pretty much all i do at work if I don't have anything better. This and also just surfing on my phone on average will take up about 75% of my day. my workspace is in a big room where there is a team of three other engineers working, so my mentor plus whoever comes into the room (a lot of people) can see my computer screen. At first i try to be ""Sneaky"" and minimize my internet explorer whenever someone comes by but i'm pretty sure they know I'm browsing on Reddit (or i guess the internet in general). Keep in mind that the odd times i do get some work i'd shut everything down and complete it asap. 

No one seems to notice me ""slacking off"" and no one ever called me out on it. There this one time where my Mentor caught me nodding off because its a monday morning, he just told me to not let the manager catch me doing it. Ever since then i've been drinking coffee lol. I'm not sure how they will think about me like this. A week ago my Mentor have told me to go into the Fabrication Shop more often and I told him I didn't want to bother people working and I was afraid I might be a safety hazard if i'd be standing and watching someone weld or something or hours. I've talked to my other engineering friends and it seems like its fairly common for coop student to be doing nothing productive when they don't have work given to them. 

I guess my question to anyone who has experience with coop students is if students get looked down upon because they are seen or caught browsing the web all the time, even when there is no work to be done, and may result in a reference for future employment? I'm sure a lot of students are wondering this too.

TL;DR concerned about being on reddit too much resulting in a bad reference for future employment. I'm only on reddit when there is no work given to me, and i've asked my Mentor/Manager if he has any work for me. Also, should I like, shuffle through blueprints everynow and then so it looks like i'm working??",AskEngineers,Djl0gic,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ynz6l/engineering_coopinternship_students_and_reference/

43,"Thinking about grad school, and have some basic questions...",1345573758,"Hey reddit. I'm going to be entering my third year as a mechanical engineering undergraduate, and am thinking about grad school. There seems to be so much to think about, and I have just a tad over a year to prepare. Yikes! 

I realize it's program-specific depending on the university, but possible grad school routes I'm thinking of are:

1) Applying straight to phd programs after I finish undergrad (Is this common?).

2) Thesis-based masters -&gt; phd program.

2) Going for a curriculum-based masters, then applying to phd programs (for universities that don't offer thesis-based masters).

Jumping into the questions:


* **How does choosing a phd/masters advisor work?**

I've seen people talk about contacting potential PIs before they are admitted into the program? How does that work? Is this simply about establishing connections to the university early on? If the PI is interested in taking you on, does this increase your chances of being accepted into the program? I've also seen people talking about looking for opportunities/doing lab rotations during the first year *after* being accepted into a program.

* **How are recommendation letters ""broken up""?**

When applying for colleges from high school, I remember there were general guidelines about who to ask for recommendation letters. Something like 1 science-related and 1 humanities-related (to show well-roundedness). My med-school-bound friends also say that for them, theres a recommended ""break down"" of who you should ask to write your rec letters. Does such a guideline exist for my situation?

* **Grad school life and vacations/time off?**

Do days off in grad school work like they do in the traditional working-world sense? I.e. Do you need to request days off from anyone, or do you just take off by your own decision?

69,Questions about 2 and 3-pronged outlets,1345473958,"I just moved into a college house with some of my buddies. I built my own desk and bedframe using the measurements I was given by the landlord. The way I planned everything, there's really only one good way everything will fit. My problem is that where I have my desk, there is only a 2-pronged outlet (without dedicated ground) so I can't plug in a surge protector. Without a surge protector there I can't plug in my computer and things, which I obviously need.

However, on the opposite wall about 11 feet away is a 3-pronged outlet at about waist level (this seems like a really stupid spot for an outlet to me). My question is, what's the easiest way for me to get power to my computer and things at my desk? I've read that extension cords are not meant to be used with power strips and could become very dangerous. One of my friends suggested I cut off the ground on the power strip to plug into the 2-pronged outlet, but I feel like this could be dangerous as well.

78,Former software developer going back to school mechanical and computer engineering. Questions about importance of school rankings (particularly URI),1345392435,"I'm looking at University of Rhode Island for two primary reasons: cost (instate) and proximity. I studied computer science at RPI but left to work and never returned. Now in my late twenties I'm ready to go back to school again (ironically I had originally intended to study Mech E at RPI but changed it after I became interested in programming and software in my last year of high school).

So I guess my question is two fold:
1) What is your opinion of program rankings? I've always considered them to be just one of many factors to consider. And my experience at RPI was that no matter how great the program is you only take out what you put in (which in my case was a lot!). And while I left school I never stopped studying on my own (whether through books, work experience, or online free lectures from MIT, Stanford, etc). 

2) Any URI grads or current students out there? I've been comparing the curriculum to other schools around new england at they all seem pretty consistent. As much as I would love to go someplace like MIT or perhaps even back to RPI I simply could never afford it. What shortcomings in the program should I be on the lookout for as compared to other programs? 

I hadn't really considered the ranking so much previously because I've met so many talented engineers in the industry from relatively unknown/unranked schools over the years and equally as many incompetent engineers from highly ranked universities. 

Thanks for any advice you may be able to offer /r/AskEngineers !

EDIT: I forgot to add that the money saved by attending a less expensive university will possibly be put towards a master's degree from a different university should I choose to take that route in a few years.

I pulled a 370 lb wagon over the same 50"" feet using a constant 15lbs of force from a weight dropped off of a 7 story building using a pulley system.

I only changed 1 variable and did 30 runs per scenario.

Scenario 1:  Completed the run in 14.8 seconds (on average)
Scenario 2:  Completed the run in 17.2 seconds
Scenario 3:  Completed the run in 17.8 seconds

96,Fresh grad just started and I hate my job already.  Dream job is available in same division...What to do?,1345124955,"Hello All,

2 months back I started as a project engineer in material handling. The project engineering role is not as much scheduling and coordinating designing and planning as I figured, but a whole lot more paper pushing. I do zero drafting because ""we’ve got guys for that"", so really my job just ends up being reviewing list after list of valves and instruments, and piping.  I spent a brief stint of my training in the R&amp;D lab and loved it, but I soon made my way back to the office where every day I spend half of my time discreetly browsing reddit, and the other half hoping a meteor might crash into my cubicle. 

So I know it may seem like I'm a bit lazy, but let me just say that my nobody in my department ever has time for me. My supervisor is too busy to teach me anything and when he assigns me something I get it done and get it back to him ASAP…and then nothing happens. I get feedback on documents about a week after I complete them, at best. So my supervisor will say ""let's go ask ____ , our mutual boss, if he's got anything you can work on."" Our mutual boss literally looks me in the eye and will say ""I don't have time to give you anything."" Once he even called my supervisor out for not keeping me busy. So I'll try going to another person or two around the office and they either don't have time to teach me to do anything or it's on a completely unrelated project that they don't want to bring me in on.

My bosses/supervisors are both great guys but I feel like: 

1) I'm wasting my time sitting at my cube every day. I've perused the entire department hard drive, spent a considerable amount of time researching investing, created a budget and a workout plan…

2) My supervisor is kind of resigned to this job because it pays the bills. He doesn't really hope to get higher up in the company and is content to settle/do a half ass job…And I feel like I might get associated with that. Which is very very bad because I consider myself pretty ambitious.

3) I'm not getting prepared to do my job properly. 1 year down the road I don't know that I'll have that much experience because I literally do nothing for such a large portion of my time.

4) I don't enjoy the paperwork and list making that I'm assigned but I get it done and I get it done quickly as well as correctly.

5) I know that the section of project engineering comes in waves. I deal primarily with power projects, and I know that my company hired a lot of people in anticipation of power projects, but a lot of them had been laid off from the company a few years back. I don't know that I want to be in the kind of position where they can ship me off when there's a down turn in business. The development engineers work with all of our equipment lines so they get to work in every business sector.

So in light of some past events around the office, I need some more advice…Here's the scoop: 

I never applied for this project engineering job but was offered it since they had filled the two I had applied for. They're all different departments…sales/project/ technology&amp;development 

One of the two positions that I applied for, development engineer, has opened up after one of our engineers packed up shop and moved across the country. 

The director of development in our division asked me at point blank if I wanted to come over to development because they are absolutely swamped.  I don't know for sure if he was serious about me specifically, but I do know they need someone and quickly I told him I would be willing to help and learn the product line sizing in my free time and he said they need someone full time, and just posted a job to the website a few days back...So wouldn't it make sense for the guy with nothing to do to move to the department where they're absolutely swamped?

**TL;DR Questions**

Is it too early (employed here for 2 months+) for me to consider changing from project to eng/tech even if it's in the same division?

Have you changed jobs internally and how was it received by your coworkers? I will see the people I'm leaving every single day and still work with them.

How should I go about pursuing an internal change of position at work…and do you think I should?

I'm sorry if this reads more like a stream of consciousness, but I needed to get my thoughts out before my head explodes. And anyways, I just killed 30 more minutes of my day. Thanks guys…",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/ybiqx/fresh_grad_just_started_and_i_hate_my_job_already/

4,"PhD student here, about to finish up my masters and in need of advice.",1345045612,"Here's my situation:

**Program Status** - I obtained my ME BS in 2011 and immediately enrolled in a PhD program focused on structural dynamics.  However, to ensure I wouldn't leave empty-handed if I decided against the PhD, my advisor recommended I complete the MS/PhD sequentially.  I recently finished the coursework for my masters and plan to defend my thesis in December.  I am scheduled to take PhD Candidacy exams in December as well.

**Funding** - First year was funded via university PhD fellowship.  This past spring I wrote a proposal for a government-funded grant and was selected to receive the award.  I have guaranteed support for two years that begins next week, and it includes tuition, stipend, and a travel/expense budget.

**Background** - Although I'm an excellent student (GPA: BS 3.9, MS 4.0; GRE 760/650), these skills haven't translated well to the research for my masters thesis.  I'm completely solo since my advisor has no other full-time students, so my limited success has left me discouraged and without direction since I haven't managed to find a system that keeps me moving forward.  

Although I crave more structure, I doubt I would be happy on a mfg floor somewhere.  I am not one who pursued an engineering career because I had a knack for taking things apart and putting them back together, but rather for the love of math and science and the chance to apply them to real problems.  I prefer CAE over getting my hands dirty, though I do also enjoy running experiments in the lab for validation.  

To compound matters, I'm a ""non-traditional"" student.  This basically means I spent a good portion of my post-secondary youth exploring what the world had to offer and didn't get started on my BS until my late 20's.  As I'm now married and contemplating kids, it's critical that I make solid decisions regarding my career.

The bottom line - I think I may enjoy research as a career, and I don't want to disqualify it simply because I have a frustrating topic that has caused me to flounder.  I always assumed this required a PhD, though after a little research it seems that a masters may be just as good (if not better).  So without clear incentives, it's difficult to see the value in continuing the PhD, especially if it forces me to put other goals on hold.

**Questions**

I realize there is only so much help to be found on the internet by way of posing generic questions.  However, any insight you can provide will be immensely appreciated.

* Is a career in research (industry, not academic) feasible without a PhD?  Will I be more limited in terms of compensation, advancement, general success, or will these largely depend on my intelligence and how hard I work regardless of whether I get a PhD?

* If I'm unsure which course I want to pursue, is it typically better to turn down a grant before it starts, or to back out of it later if I decide not to continue the PhD?

* For those researchers with a PhD, was it worth it?  Would you do it all over again?  If you didn't have your PhD in your 30's, would you still have chosen to get one?

* For those researchers without a PhD, how are you faring?  Have you experienced any drawbacks to only having a masters?  Have you had any experiences that made you thankful you didn't have a PhD?  Do you plan to get a PhD in the future?

* For those in product design, do you find that former researchers can make the transition to product design well?  Are their skills valuable in such a setting?  I've considered this as an alternate path, so I'm interested to hear whether I'll need to start from scratch or if my experience will at all helpful.

* Since I have guaranteed (though meager) funding for two years, I am hesitant to enter the workforce considering possible federal sequestration which may cut numerous federal contracts leading to mass layoffs in the future.  Any thoughts on how this should impact my decision?

5,Electrical Engineers- Dollar Cost per Ohm to Ground,1345045280,"I'm a very junior engineer at an industrial firm. I recently worked on a grounding plan- nothing special, just a bunch of ovens. When talking with a senior engineer, discussing a particular note on the grounding plan concerning measured ohms to ground, we got into a more general discussion about the requirements for various applications (sensitive equipment requiring fewer ohms, NEC requirements, etc) as well as parameters involved (number of ground rods, soil conditions, etc). The discussion ended with a general statement that reducing ohms to ground below 5ohms starts to get more and more expensive. I was wondering if anyone had any kind of rule of thumb percentage increase per ohm to ground reduced.

I understand that there are entire software suites for this kind of thing, that one can make an entire career just doing grounding, conditions will vary wildly, etc. Just looking for a rule of thumb.

7,Building a Vactrain underground - does geographical location latter?,1345007537,"Vactrain technology is nowhere near economic feasibility at the moment, but let's pretend that this project is undertaken.  Where do we build them?  Robert Salter suggested underground tunnels, but the costs of blasting rocks in order to make space would surely be one of the most expensive expenditures of the whole project, no? 

Where would be the best geographic location for building this tunnel? 
Let's also say that it doesn't matter where in the world we want the tunnel.  Could be DC, could be Tokyo, could be Saudi Arabia, wherever, we just want a Vactrain running somewhere in the world.  Considering things such as soil and weather, where would be the best place to create such a project?

My other question is: What would the advantages/disadvantages of building a Vactrain in a desert location such as parts of Saudi Arabia or the Gobi desert?  Would the sand clear much more easily than other soils?  Would be there less manpower involved?  Any difference at all?  Or would the Vactrain be buried much deeper underground where most of the ""soil"" is rock?

1. When the grain size of a metal is decreased, which of the following is **TRUE?**

         a. the yield stress increases and the elastic modulus decreases	
	 b. the yield stress decreases and the elastic modulus decreases	
	 c. the yield stress decreases and the elastic modulus increases	
	 d. the yield stress increases and the elastic modulus is unchanged	
	 e. the yield stress is unchanged and the elastic modulus increases

*For this I was personally thinking 'c.'*

2.  An aluminium rod of cross-section 10 mm x 10 mm is stretched along its axis, changing length from 2.000 m to 2.001 m. The deformation is elastic, or fully recoverable. Given that the modulus of the aluminium is 70 GPa, the stress on the rod is approximately (choose the closest answer):

 a. 35kPa	
	 b. 35MPa	
	 c. 35GPa	
	 d. 350MPa	
	 e. 350GPa

*My answer came to be 7.0035x10^(10). Which isn't an option ):*

3.  The elastic strain, εEL of a metal sample of modulus E1, uniaxially stretched to a total strain of ε1 and stress σ1 is -

 a. σ1/E1	
	 b. σ1 - ε1/E1	
	 c. E1-σ1/ε1	
	 d. E1 - ε1/σ1	
	 e. ε1-E1/σ1

*I really had no idea for this.*

4. During elastic deformation of a material in compression:

a. the bonds are stretched as the atoms are displaced from their equilibrium positions	
	 b. the atoms slide past one another into new equilibrium positions	
	 c. the material is plastically deformed	
	 d. the volume of the material decreases	
	 e. the atoms are forced closer together as they are displaced from their equilibrium positions

*I thought 'e' as it was the only one that made sense for compression. Not entirely sure though.*

5. Work Hardening is a measure of stored elastic energy.

true
false

*I think it's true but again, not entirely sure.*

6. Which of the following is true:

a. yield strength of a metal can't be changed by increasing or decreasing the dislocation density	
	 b. dislocation movement is affected by grain boundaries	
	 c. dislocations are related to the material's elastic modulus	
	 d. dislocation density decreases during deformation	
	 e. dislocation movement is the mechanism of elastic deformation in metals

*I'm thinking 'c' but maybe *

7. As Chief Materials Engineer for an electronics company, you have been asked to investigate problems with a single crystal cantilever beam used in a switch. Some of the switches have been found to be faulty, and this has been traced to low stiffness of some of the single crystals. What is the most likely explanation and appropriate solution for this behaviour?

a. Modulus varies with bond strength; the crystal has an inappropriate bond strength. The switch should be used at a higher temperature.
	
b. Modulus varies with grain size; the crystal has been used with an inappropriate grain size. A larger grain size should be used instead.	

c. Modulus varies with atom packing; the crystal has been used in an inappropriate orientation. A polycrystalline material should be used instead.	

*Really have no idea.*

d. Modulus varies with chemical composition; an inappropriate composition has been used. A stronger alloy should be used instead.

8. The elastic modulus of a material is most dependent on:

a. the concentration of dislocations	
	 b. the size of the grains	
	 c. the purity of the material	
	 d. the arrangement of atoms	
	 e. the type of bonding between the atoms and/or molecules

*I'm leaning towards 'b' or 'e', but don't know which.*

Hi


Brief info about myself.

I live in Perth, Australia. 

I'm about to turn 20 years old.

My highest level of education is year 11. 

Going through high school all my subjects were filled with sport. I was ahead of most my class for most my school years, but I chose sport and friends first. 

After I injured my knees and ankle and was finished with sport, my school (kwinana) didn't allow me to change into the engineering course, so I left.

Between the years of leaving school and now, I've had a couple jobs here and there. 
I've been too scared to commit to studying again because of the environment I was in and the people that were around me.

Now I feel is the best time for me to start studying, but I don't know how to go about things. 
I'm going to get in contact with some Schools and our College/education and training provider TAFE. 
But in the mean time would just like some information.

I have done other great work for them too, enough to know that I can and will be a great engineer regardless of my low gpa I just needed a chance to prove myself. Anyways...

He then came back with 46k and a 10k bonus that seems pretty easy to achieve, 1k signing bonus, 3 weeks vacation, 50% health/dental paid, 401k no matching yet but they will start soon, and he also said he would be more than willing to pay for me to go back to school for additional classes or even a masters. Also said I will get a performance review and raise in 6 months then again 6 months after. Other perks include getting to travel a lot from various expos year round to also China/HK twice a year to oversee manufacturing (and I love to travel!)

On top of all this I really do love and enjoy the job and the people working there, it hits nearly all of my dream job criteria: mechanical research/design engineering job close to where i live in the city so i don't need a car, left to do as i please with hardly any over site, no dress code (wear jeans and a t-shirt everyday), aren't strict at all about when I come in or leave, get to make clear contributions to the company and work directly with CEO/lead engr., get to wear many hats so to speak, so far I have automated tests with circuits i built myself, automated data analysis with matlab programs, did a bunch of heat transfer/thermal analysis for new product line (I've gotten to apply a lot of different things I learned in school which I think is pretty cool lol), built a bunch of difference prototypes in the machine shop after modeling them in CAD, which brings me to another thing I love as a DIYer who lives in a small apartment in SF is that they have a full machine shop getting better every day that I will have full access too, and finally the travel.

The only thing I feel bad about is the pay as I was honestly expecting something close to 70-75k being in the bay area. I don't know how much my raise will be for in 6 months but I think even if it brings me up to even 55k I should be happy, I am just worried that I'll still be living pay check to pay check since I gotta support my GF, pay all the bills, pay back student loans, etc. Oh also another thing is that there arent really any senior experienced engineers there that could mentor me and teach me new things, most of the learning as far as engineering goes I have done has been on my own. The main things I am learning from them is all the manufacturing/business stuff as the other engr. I work for has the same degree as me, no EIT or MS.

So what should I do? Are all those perks I mentioned common at many other engr. jobs? Should I be looking for a better paying job right now or should I keep working here for a year or two, see what happens and then look for another job when I have a full year of experience? I guess I am still used to living like a poor bastard and still could for another year, but fuck, I feel like if I wanted to make 46k I coulda just become a teacher, cop, or something else that wouldnt have nearly killed me with stress and work through school (not that I don't love because I do).

39,I'm getting ready for my engineering Co-op this fall. What advice can you offer me?,1344725914,"I've been offered an mechanical engineering co-op job at a plant that makes lightbulbs, and I should be starting around the 27th (never touched any drug beyond aspirin, cough syrup, or caffeine, and I've never had anything illegal outside of a speeding ticket, so the tests/checks shouldn't keep me out at the last minute).

What general advice can you offer me?

What are some not-obvious-beforehand things to avoid?

What are some good practices that will make it less likely for me to screw something up, and more likely to be an actual asset instead of dead weight?

One of the guys was nice enough to explain to me how every different thing in the plant is named after the guy who either made it wrong the first time, broke it, or can't keep it running. How do I make sure I don't have anything named after me?

What are some of the key things I should be trying to pick up from the engineers who I'm going to be working with?

How can I be more awesome in the job, and make myself more awesome through the job?

A professor (who had worked there when he was a student) said I should be prepared to sweat as many of the things I'd probably be working on would be in 130 degree Fahrenheit areas near or above furnaces (he's not the type to ever joke about or exaggerate those sorts of things). So I know I'm going to need steel-toe shoes (wide feet so I hate them, but they are mandatory), and short sleeves that won't get caught in machinery (lots of open assembly lines everywhere), but beyond that are there any personal clothing or equipment choices that help deal with heat, provide extra protection, or have some other logical benefit proven by experience? I saw some of the guys wearing what looked like custom ear protection (I had to use the little dispensed foam things in my ears when the engineers gave me a tour at my interview, and the little buggers kept popping out), so is there an ideal trade-off point between ear safety and being able to hear people talking to you?

I have been reading on how EE's, except for power engineers who work for the utilities, mostly carry out mundane tasks and sit behind a computer most of the day.

First off, I want to find a job. Second, I want to be able to work on something important, and see a result. Third, and most importantly, I want to work hands on (not hands on a computer).
I got accepted to Florida Atlantic University's graduate school for electrical engineering. I'm now thinking about going for a different engineering field.

Using this site: http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/home.htm

I have found that environmental, civil, and bioengineering are on the rise in terms of job markets.
As for bioengineering, they have the highest estimated job growth, but all of the anecdotes I've read have indicated that it is almost impossible to find a job after graduation.

I know almost nothing about what environmental engineers do, but it sounds like it could be worthwhile.

I'm probably most interested in civil engineering at this point, if they accept me to the program as an EE graduate. I would be problem solving on a work site actually solving problems, and it would be more hands on from what I understand.

For the past 2 years, I have been doing my PhD in analytical chemistry at McGill in Canada. In June, however, my research supervisor accepted a position at another university as VP research. I basically had 3 options: 

* Move with him and finish my PhD in 3 more years 
* Transfer to another supervisor and start over on another project
* Finish this summer with a Masters instead of a PhD

After much thought, I decided that my career goals have changed since being admitted into my PhD program, so I've decided to take the Masters and run. This has allowed me to rethink my career goals and I've decided to pursue engineering. Ultimately, I would like to work in an R&amp;D setting, or possibly take on some kind of entrepreneurial business project. My interests specifically lie in the field of robotics and electronics, with applications to prosthesis and related fields. I feel with my chemical background, this would give me an edge in what I understand to be a very interdisciplinary field. As well, my PhD thesis was focused on designing instrumentation for point of care analysis, so I guess I'm already on the right track (this work showed me what I'm really interested in). 

Now that the story is out of the way... My question basically boils down to which degree I should pursue. The ""obvious"" choice is the Masters degree, but it doesn't seem to me like it's going to be enough.  I feel like having the broad background provided by a bachelors will set me up better for a job in industry. If I chose a masters, will I be missing out on a lot of background that makes engineers so useful? What will future employers think if they see B.Sc. M.Sc. B.eng?

I'm a sophomore and currently declared Civil Engineer. I chose Civil/Environmental Engineering because I am very interested in all environmental issues, and really want to work on sustainability and green design when I graduate. 

However, I'm scared because I'm constantly hearing how the market is going down for Civil Engineers, and that Mechanical Engineers can do the same stuff as Civils, plus some. I'm going to be seriously in debt after college, and don't want to have any regrets. 

I know Mechanical isn't as focused on Environmental issues as Civil is in school, but I feel like it has equal potential to do so after graduation. However, I feel like I'm not very inclined toward robotics, cars, etc., but have thus far really enjoyed design of static structures (I just have no experience with mechanics, basically). Also, I'm female and not sure that jumping into this with no previous interest in basic mechanics is a good idea.

Specifically pertinent to 5L-0511?,1344364407,"I'm working on a threading issue for one of our customers who's been trying to mate NPT threaded pipe into API 5L-0511 couplings. They've been breaking a lot of tools because they're cutting super deep to account for the difference in tapers. The issues I'm having are their fittings. We have tools to thread several different API specs but their fittings seem to be bizzarre.

When we first encountered the problem they were using NPT tooling on sizes of 3"" and 4"" tubing and putting API couplings on them. We thought this was their primary issue and had them send us fittings for which we could try our API tooling and see if they fit. It appears the have standard 2-3/8 8RD and 2-7/8 8RD. It seems to provide a tight smooth fit and my only question is that when viewed from a profile(we cut a fitting in half) it appears the threads are v shaped on the fitting. This could just be the difference between internal and external threads for API though, my knowledge is limited to external threads only.

They also have a 2"" fitting with the API logo stamped into it and the 5L-0511 certificate as well. This is an API fitting, but it's different than a basic API 2"" 10RD thread. It appears to have the 11.5TPI of normal NPT threads and the fitting appears to have a v shape internally. I know that other designations of API threads exist outside of the standard 10RD and 8RD of certain sizes. I'm at a loss as to what type of threading they're trying to do and unfortunately they seem less knowledgeable than I about their own products.

Hopefully some of you can answer some questions I had about subsea production trees. I've been doing some research on them out of pure curiosity, but have compiled a list of questions that I could not find the answer to online. If you can answer any of these questions, it would be great.

-How does guideline installation work? Just generally, not the specific parts.

-What is guidelineless installation?

-How does the choke fit into the flow process? Is it right before the jumper interface?

-Why is workover (supposed to be) easier with the horizontal tree? 

-Why is the cap internal for horizontal trees, and is it an advantage for workover?

-Is the tree cap removed for workover?

-Kill wing purpose other than acting as an injection point for kill fluid (cement)? Are there other chemical injectors in the kill wing?

-Purpose of swab valve?

-Why does the location of the hanger matter? Meaning in vertical vs horizontal trees.

-What is the purpose of the annulus, besides just being an area between casings?

-Do both vertical and horizontal trees allow vertical access to the annulus? Why is access to the annulus needed?

-Why are vertical trees (supposedly) better for high pressure wells/large well count projects?

-Why are the number of required valves higher in vertical trees? I would think they would be the same as horizontal trees.

-Is an installation riser required for horizontal trees? Or is there a special tool used?

I guess mathcad automatically multiplied it by gravity so I did not see that and was accounting for it twice. The units work out to just inches now. Thanks everyone!


Hey everyone,

I'm trying to calculate a wall thickness based on a specific formula. Unfortunately, I can't share what exactly is going into the formula, but I can share the units that will go in the denominator and numerator and maybe one of you can help me figure out where things are going wrong.

Essentially, I have:

UF will stand for unitless factor to simplify things.

It's complex, so here's how I'll break it down. I'll have 4 equations, A, B,C,D and then throw those into a final equation at the end.

A = (UF* (PSI/UF)* (inches/inches)^ 3 * (psi* (inches/inches))  

I believe this comes out to psi^ 2


B = SQRT(((PSI/UF)* (inches/inches)^ 3)^ 2+(psi* (inches/inches))^ 2)

I believe this comes out to psi

C = (inches/s^ 2) * (lb/inch^ 3)

I believe this comes out to (lb)/(s* inch)^ 2

D = (UF - ((UF* UF)/(inches/inches))

I believe this comes out to UF.

Now the final equation will be:
(A/B/C) * D 
or
((A* C)/B) * D  

NOTE: In the equation, it is listed as [A/B/C]*D, with A,B,C divided vertically all inside a bracket. I've tried multiple approaches to this part of the equation but still don't end up with inches.



Anyway, for some reason I get the following:

( ((psi* psi)* (inch/s^ 2)* (lb/inch^ 3)) / (psi) )  *  UF

or

psi^ 2 / psi / (lb/(inch^ 2* s^ 2)

This equals psi / (lb/(inch^ 2* s^ 2)
or
(lb/inch^ 2)* ((inch^ 2* s^ 2)/lb)

That would mean my units are **seconds^ 2**

I don't know why that is, the formula seems right, but that definitely does not seem like a thickness unit, haha.

11,could use some help with a utility trailer frame please.,1344186942,"Looking to build a utility trailer. Please help with the frame design, not looking for a complete blueprints, just some hints of what metal to use, some tips, whatever. 
Considered a store bought trailer but they look and feel cheap and this would make a good family project. 
 I have an old popup camper frame to start with, or can completely build a new frame.(see pics) http://imgur.com/a/r4iFd/all#0
The original goal was to move the axles outside the frame of the popup trailer but the frame does not look so hot, does not line up with the axle mounts and currently has a broken 2000lb axle

The trailer will be used for hauling furniture, appliances, golf cart, lawnmower, yard waste,  dirt, sometimes construction materials and rarely a motorcycle. 

Parts I have:
separate torsion axles 3500lb (1 rt and 1 lt not connected by a tube)
http://www.ebay.com/itm/3500-Torsion-Axle-Stub-RV-Trailer-Camper-1750-ea-/350192458071?pt=Motors_RV_Trailer_Camper_Parts_Accessories&amp;hash=item518918d957&amp;vxp=mtr
15inch  LRC wheels/tires.
 Tailgate from the old trailer (76 inches wide)
Used popup frame (1970's, tube rusted at back, frame cracked between tongue, old. Tongue  repaired once already. Currently less than 4ft between fenders)
Arch fenders without backs 
Plastic storage box

Goals:  
Primary:  Wheels outside the frame so deck is useable. 
Secondary: construct or reconstruct a strong, overbuilt single axle frame that will last decades and use the axle/ tires/ tailgate I already bought.
other:
low as possible to the ground
76"" (wide to use current tailgate can cut apart and re-weld) 
10 Ft long
wood deck
short metal sides made from angle like the trailers sold at Lowe's and TSC. (easy to add later)
useable tie downs. 
 
Current plan: (can be changed).
2x3rectangle 14ga steel perimeter and cross supports at 2ft intervals. V tongue with 2 inch ball coupler welded to the front and 2nd frame members.
Axles welded to the frame. 
Axle at 60% length but this will cause the hub to be farther back than 60% (is this a problem?)

Ideas:
Reddit alien stickers on the sides and fenders.
Hidden deck fasteners. (maybe not needed but neat idea)
Deck flush with the frame ( not needed but looks nice)
Tie down points? I'd like at least 4 down each side. (bolted to gussets? Metal rod bent in u shape? d rings?)
Under mount or curbside mount for spare tire.
Mount plastic storage box on tongue.
Build new ramps and use them as part of the sides.

Problems:
What do I make the frame from? Tube, rectangle, square, I, H, angle?
I have a supplier  close to me but they only have up to 8ft pieces.
Should I use deck boards or 2x for the deck? (not a fan of ply)
What size / gauge steel? 
What about the tongue, type of steel and gauge?
How far apart to place floor supports?
Wood deck mounted length or width of frame?
Screws from top or bottom?
Bolt or weld the axles on?
Fix up the old frame or start new?
How many gussets, what gauge and where to place them?

I'm pretty much done with the overall design of the support structure and such and the only places open are:

turbine/engine.

in regards to the pressure vessel -  i had an idea of digging a hole in the ground, inserting a used fuel carriage vessel(about 5-6 cubic meters)there and covering the whole thing with some high strength concrete. Considering that the input and output areas have to be strenghtened to make sure that nothing happens to them(if they break then i'll have a really expensive paperweight).
Is this a feasible idea or would the concrete start cracking under the pressure in a short while?

As for the turbine, i've decided to experiment with a single/double stage Tesla turbine. If it is very inefficient, then the other option is to take a small 2-4 cylinder engine and convert it to usage with compressed air.

32,Hydraulics/pump question about suction lines,1343979835,"Hello engineers of Reddit. I work for a company who makes chemical injection systems for water tanks, pools, spas ponds ect. Our system uses a simple solenoid with a rubber seal which opens when a chemical is required (liquid chemicals used) and uses the pumps suction to draw them chemicals through. The injection point for these chemicals is on the suction side of the pump. The seal wears out over time as it is used and it closes against the suction. One of our service staff advised a client today that he should not run his pool cleaner as often because it increases the amount of suction on the seals and can cause them to wear through sooner than expected. Also that not running the cleaner as often will save wear on the cleaner. It was just a general tip to try and help save the guy money. Long story short he went off at the service guy saying that the pool cleaner would make no difference to the amount of suction and he was lying and was generally unpleasant. 

He has since phoned me saying it is bullshit. I explained to him that the suction line is under vacuum and that adding the extra 10 meters of hose which is smaller in diameter increases the strain on the pump thus the injection point right before the pump has more vacuum put on it, wearing the seals faster. Once again he lost the plot and started going on about how he is a hydraulics engineer (along with a whole heap of other engineering disciplines) and he has built various mines and equipment plants. I asked him what he thinks happens when the pump is put under more load to which he said the only change would be the water speed and that is it and that he has an IQ over 200 and that mine was probably about 70. Staying calm with him i told him to test it with a vacuum gauge with and without the extra hose and test it for himself.

Okay so my question is, why was he saying it would make no change? I have seen many equipment installs and have shown customers the vacuum at the injection point with and without the cleaner a clear difference can be seen on the gauge just about every time. The set-ups in question are a pump drawing from above water level through a regular pool pump. I would like to have what is actually happening here explained so if this bizarre scenario ever comes up again i am better equipped for it.

Does it mean that a chemical engineer learns the fundamentals of each? They can design products that help advance each of those fields? Each of those fields are used to advance chemical engineering? A chemical engineer learns as much about the human body, computers, electricity, quantum physics, etc as each of those fields because of the work they do when they become professional engineers?

I was going to start on the Computer/Electrical Engineering program on that site, but part of what I want to do is learn about the smallest units of matter and energy and apply that knowledge to enhancing/healing the human body and brain, and develop new materials, such as something that's both lightweight and can block armor piercing rounds, develop new materials, algorithms, etc for better and faster and more heat resistant computers.

Would chemical engineering be a better choice? Or what if I got into the Physics program? 

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/

Would that basically cover the biggest and smallest things in the universe and how they interact? Would that give me a better understanding of how chemicals, living cells, atoms, subatomic particles, energy, anti/dark matter and energy work better than any engineering course? I don't fully understand the difference between, for example, chemistry and chemical engineering and physics and electrical engineering. Is it just learning to apply scientific knowledge to designing machines and computers to do stuff with it?

Whichever one I ""enroll"" (studying the free material on my own and to supplement my future college classes) in, at the same time I'll be taking their mathematics courses. I understand and get along with math better than anything, so whichever science I get stuck on, I expect to be more consistent and steady with mathematics.

And this is not something I expect to learn in a few years. I'm aware of the wide range of things I want to learn.

-More specifically a project that I am interested in is to create a usb controlled and powered device that would alert me when something such as an e-mail was received. I have done a bit of research for this and found [this](http://www.instructables.com/id/Email-notification-bell/) and [this](http://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/article/a-usb-email-indicator) but they both require a quite expensive ($45-70) micro controller that would make the project not worth it for me. I think a better option would be to make the device un-powered when there are no new e-mails present and power it only when a new email is received(controlled via a program on the computer). Hopefully this will eliminate the need for one of those chips but I could be wrong.

41,A question regarding reversible and irreversible cycles and entropy,1343933082,"I've been preparing myself for a final test, and i got stuck trying to understand how entropy works in a cyclic process. I thought you guy might be able to help me grasp the idea.

Right now I have this (seemingly) simple question:

I know that, in a closed path, AS (A beeing delta, variation) equals 0 if the process is reversible. If the cycle (or at least part of it) is irreversible, then AS &lt; 0.

Let's say i have a cycle of evolutions of a gas. A-B a reversible evolution. B-C Irreversible. C-A reversible.

Now, i also know that, if i want to get the AS of an irreversible process, i just need to get a reversible evolution that links the inicial and final point of the evolution (for example, and isothermic evolution, if the inicial and final temperatures are equal) , and take its entropy variation. It gives me the entropy variation of the irreversible process too, because entropy variation does not depend on the path.

Now, the question itself:

If i can do what i stated above, then i'm treating B-C as a reversible process. But that's not true, and AS of the entire cycle will be 0. But the cycle is a irreversible process, so it's AS should be less than 0.

Could you help me?

I start off with converting to rad/s and get 16.8

then link AB i get 

Vb = 16.8k x (1.5i + 2.6j)
Vb = -25.2i +43.68j

going to link BD

I make a new triangle by using the sin and cos of the 60
10 in hypotenous
9.4 horizontally
3.4 vertically

using Vd = Vb + Vd/b 

making new reference point at Vb

i get Vd = -25.2i + 43.68j +WDBk(9.4i+3.4j)
vd= -25.2i + 43.68j +9.4WDBj - 3.4WDBi

knowing Vd is in the i direction, i split up the i's and j's

VDi= -25.2 - 3.4WDB

I know that I want to make robots. I'm already skilled on the programming / computer side of it. I think my weakest side would be the mechanical side of it. E.g, how to design a machine that can move its arms the way you program it to, etc. I think that the electrical side would probably be simple enough that it could be learnt on my own, from a book or a friend, and if I knew the mechanical side and the programming side, I wouldn't have too much trouble with the electrical side.

Whereas if I knew the electrical side and computer side, but not the mechanical side, then I would have more trouble since to me, it seems like mechanics is far more involved and complex that it can't be learnt as easily as the electrical side.

However, I'm not sure, and I'd like some advice. So the options are:

a) Doing bachelors and masters in mechanical.

b) Doing bachelors and masters in electrical.

c) Doing bachelors in mech, masters in elec.

d) Doing bachelors in elec, masters in mech.

e) Doing bachelors in mechatronics engineering, then masters in mech.

f)  Doing bachelors in mechatronics engineering, then masters in electrical.

a) The velocity just before touching the bracket in C, if the force acts throughout the movement.

I've noted that if there are a series of traffic lights in a line and they are all green the first one will turn red followed by the second and so on. My understanding is that this pattern allows for a few cars to stop at each red light so that there aren't so many cars stopped at the red light that congestion moves to the intersection of the previous traffic light. I would think (though I can't be sure) that a square lattice of traffic lights such as in a city with square blocks would yield a diagonal pattern of red lights going one way followed by a diagonal pattern of red lights going orthogonal. [Note: I am assuming that traffic is just as heavy in all directions.]

My question revolves around other lattices and how the traffic patterns would change. Say you had triangular city blocks and so the city was arranged in a [hexagonal lattice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_lattice) so each intersection had six streets. How then would the greens/reds of traffic lights go? I would guess they'd go along one direction followed by another and then through the third. Does the direction (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) matter? Continuing about hexagonal lattices, what if each street block was a hexagon and so you had a honeycomb pattern of street blocks. Each intersection would then lead to three streets. How would the traffic light pattern go throughout the system? I really can't see how this one would operate so if there is some sort of answer to this scenario I am very interested.

Finally, and I admit that this is just a bizarre hypothetical, what if the street blocks were arranged in a [quasicrystalline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal) pattern? Does the traffic light algorithm break down when there is no periodicity?

The obvious solution is relocate the sewer line, that's going to be performed by the country within the next year or two. What we are looking for is a method to protect the line from the increased load of this wall until the line has been relocated. We are trying to avoid further delay of our project which is also a County building project.
The wall contractor suggested digging a 2'x2' trench on either side of the line with about 7"" of clearance from each side of the 9"" line, edge of trench to edge of trench would be 6'.
Fill trench's with 57 stone, cover pipe with 57 stone. Then use 500 Strength GeoGrid across the entire 6', then 8"" layer of 57 stone, layer of GeoGrid, stone, etc, (3) total layers of stone &amp; grid. This protection would extend 5' beyond his wall grid and 5' past the other side of the wall.

The number 1 limitation right now is power. The suit, as shown in the movie, would require so much power, and any way we have of producing such power would be so large, it is no longer a suit. Notice in the movie, it relies on an ""arc reactor."" For the power we're talking about here you'd either have to have mastered the mythical cold fusion or perhaps extremely high density batteries. Both of these technologies are being researched, although I'm not sure either of them are being thought about in an Iron Man way.

Secondly- an extremely hard shell is not actually great for protection. What hurts (and kills) a man is extreme acceleration. Putting a man in a very hard suit doesn't really protect him from such accelerations. Helmets always have a hard shell and then a soft interior. The hard shell is to protect the helmet, and let it keep its shape, the soft part is what protects your head. The research for this is being done by NASA. One of the hardest things about putting people into space (and moving them around up there) is that all the best fuels for doing cause too much acceleration, and would crush a person. Designing suits which reduce the g-forces on a person would allow us to use much higher-impulse fuels, which would greatly reduce the cost of space travel.

I'm sure there are many other things which would have to be worked out, like making a human form stable in flight. However, I'd say the biggest thing is powering the suit, and to really make it ""Iron Man-ish"" you're going to have to have a huge uptick in g-force protection.

Speaking from a ""philosophy of war"" perspective: the government really is moving towards a ""precision"" based weapons systems. There is no army which can stand up to the U.S in an all out war scenario (think WWII), but the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan showed we have a lack of ability to fight in close combat, no collateral damage warfare. Such a suit would be useful in such a scenario.

I'm not sure if I answered what exactly you were asking, but feel free to ask anything else specifically you have.



***Here are my questions regarding the previous context (Expand on anything you want including the initial question or what he said):***

* What would be the most realistic material for doing this then? 

* Would the person wearing this have to wear a special G force suit and then overlay it with the armor and maybe another overlay of protection (Kevlar maybe)? (In the movies, it is all together I think.) 

* It would obviously have to be cooled, would this be a problem? 

* After getting the power source would arming it be the easy part?

* What kind of research would it require to get the power source to be sort of jet pack size or like on the back of NASA suits?

* What UI would be the most realistic one and would that feasible?

71,Civil or Mechanical Engineering,1343764213,"I've just finished my freshman year of Civil Engineering and I'm on the fence about switching to Mechanical Engineering for the coming fall, which I could transfer to easily with no difference in curriculum or graduation time. The one thing that bothers me is while it seems like a great major and interesting career, I have never considered it up to this point and have never considered myself mechanically inclined, so I have no clue where I would want to land career-wise and if I would enjoy or be good at it which leads me to think this may be a fad decision or one brought on by seeing friends in Mechanical enjoying themselves.

The reason I picked Civil Engineering in the first place was because I originally wanted to do Architecture, but decided it wasn't for me, and I was in carpentry at my vocational high school. Though we haven't done any in depth courses or anything like that, Civil Engineering is striking me as being boring, repetitive, and hardly engineering to be honest. As a career, while you do get to work on some impressive projects, you're not involved in designing a building or building it, so you end up as the middle man that gets either no credit or all the blame based on a projects success or failure respectively. Also all of the design is based on rehashing designs and following city guidelines, which is hardly design at all as far as I'm concerned.

In Mechanical, you can work for a plethora of companies doing energy, national defense, micro-mechanics, and a bunch of other fields at big names companies in so many industries. Plus it is a stronger background to have I feel, in the sense that it can be used to branch off into Aerospace Engineering or Patent Law with another degree, and the work seems more fun, but I have no real calling to say ""I've always wanted to work on cars"" that would make me want to instantly make this change. You could say I also don't have that with Civil Engineering, but it seems closer to what I originally planned to do albeit seemingly boring while Mechanical is a jump from that and I don't know what goal I gave by being in it.

**TL;DR** Freshman in Civil, it seems boring and thankless. Want to switch to Mechanical, but I have never considered it before and don't know if I would enjoy it or just considering it because my friends in the major seem to enjoy it.

P.S. These are the only two engineering fields I am considering. Not to mention all of my Civil courses are transferrable which makes things easier since freshman years classes are so similar.

4,Help me build a linear motor,1343580862,"Magnets!

So I'm installing a sliding door to my bathroom and I want it to move all on its own. I've looked at various options and currently I'm considering bulding a simple linear motor. If I could get it to work, it would be a (probably) cheap and completely silent solution. It might also be more reliable with fewer moving parts than a rotary motor and a pulley system or whatever else I could use.

So, I'm considering [this design](http://imgur.com/idkR5.png) right now. It has no permanent magnets but instead a number of electromagnets (e.g. 4 as in the drawing) activating in sequence to pull on iron stubs in a bar attached to the door. It can't not work! Two little things, though:

First, I'm a little lost on the physics of electromagnetism. What factors do I need to consider to determine the pulling force of each magnet (number of windings, current, voltage?) and how does this force change with the distance to each stub?

I need the door, weighing about 15 kg all in all, to accelerate to 2 m/s in about 1/2 s, then decelerate at the same rate. So since only one magnet will be on at any given time, each needs to be able to exert a net horizontal force of 60 N on the bar, on average. At the beginning of each phase, the setup would look something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/gpyYs.png) (although dimensions could change if they should). So how do I proportion the magnet and the iron stubs to ensure that the horizontal component of Fa+Fb is around 60 N. 

Ideally I would drive it at 0-20 V with one or more laptop PSUs, at a maximum current of maybe 5 A, and I can of course control the voltage ramps precisely with a microcontroller and some suitable amplifier/stepper motor driver. I expect to fine-tune everything by trial-and-error once the thing is built and mounted, but I'd rather have everything sort-of in the right ballpark to begin with.

I'm also prepared to do a lot more reading, but I can't find any good resources.

The second thing I need is a sensor of some sort to determine the current position of the door (to control phases etc.).

(I'm aware of the need for a battery and a way to incorporate physical buttons but that's about it. Also the actual watch itself.)


Also, a more pragmatic question: As engineering professionals, do you think I should pursue this? I'm starting with almost zero knowledge of engineering with regards to hardware and very little software experience. Any suggestions?

I am currently working as a nuclear engineer (handling electrical components) for the government (that is the US government). I've been here about a year. I don't use anything I learned in school, apart from my technical writing course. Although I like this job for now, I feel in 3-5 years I'm going to want a change. I know I am fortunate to even have a job, but I feel like I am not applying my skills at all and I could be making more elsewhere. Its not just about money, its also about feeling fulfilled. My job is very slow and there will be weeks I go with no work. I feel like I am just wasting my potential. Some of the stuff I have begun to think about: How important is the stuff we learned in school for working in the private industry?

How rigorous (not sure if thats the right word) is the private industry? My job is very laid back. Supervisors have the attitude 'as long as you get your shit done we wont bother you'.

48,Designing an Air Vortex Cannon,1343305032,"Hi Guys,

This might be more of a physics question but I figure I'll try you guys first as you have yet to fail me!

I am designing an air vortex cannon similar to the [Airzooka](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/60b6/).  Mine will also have a slightly tapered cylinder body but will be designed for 3D printing, I will upload the design to [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/) when complete.

My question is: Is there an optimal diameter of the hole that the air is pushed through with respect to the size of the cylinder?  Seems like every other DIY air cannon I've seen online just eye-balls it but as an engineer I have a strong need to optimize.  My intuition tells me it just has to be small enough to block out the turbulent air at the boundary letting through forward moving laminar-ish air.  Nice thing about 3D printing is that I can do pretty much any geometry I want.

Any fluids whizzes out there with an insight?

I got a 34 on my most recent ACT so that really opened my doors to out of state schools. I currently get in state tuition for Indiana and Kentucky (maybe Ohio). I also may be able to get in state at LSU since no school in Kentucky offers petroleum engineering.

I don't really have any specific questions, just maybe some general viewpoints on any colleges or fields of engineering would be great. I am meeting up with my college counselor next Tuesday and would like to have a better idea of the colleges I want to shoot for.

In work, I'm supposed to be predicting the fatigue life of a certain steel component (grade S 275 JR). The component is just a restrained plate, with a hole in it. There is a pin going through the hole which is pulled sideways causing a contact stress of 290MPa, the plate has already been checked for bearing strength, that's fine.

The plate will be loaded upto similar loads each time it is used, then unloaded 290MPa is expected to be the maximum stress in the piece near the point of contact.

I've trawled the internet for S-N curves for S275JR Steel, even the endurance limit for this steel, so I can't read off an S-N curve the number of cycles this material will take, nor can I use Goodmans method of estimating life

**Background:**

Co-worker modified a window air conditioner to chill methanol. Needed a way of being able to control the compressor in the chiller.

With the help here I was able to pinpoint the relay that activates the compressor. I connected a by-pass for the relay so now I control the relay from my daq. I confirmed the relay does still work with my override, now I need to work out the coding required. 

**Problem**

Need to figure out the coding to achieve the requirements below

**Requirements**

I'm going for pretty basic functionality here, just needs to do two basic tasks.

When the coolant temperature is greater than offset plus the setpoint, turn on the chiller. 

When the coolant temperature is less than the offset minus the setpoint, turn off the chiller. 

Wait until first requirement is true. 

**So far**

I'm pretty stumped on the coding of this. I just don't fully understand how to have it wait until it heats back above the setpoint+offset without using a delay function. Not that I can't use a delay but I'd prefer not to. 

Edit: 

Edit again:

I got it working using this code!

       read(Mean(Coolant_In[0,10]))

My issue is splicing the Dell cord onto the Mac cord coming out of the Mac psu. The Mac cord simply has a red wire and a black wire, as seen here:
http://i.imgur.com/xpNpuh.jpg

The Dell cord has the outer layer of black rubber, then a layer of wire mesh, surrounding a layer of white rubber, then another layer of wire mesh, then another layer of white rubber, and lastly a thin wire in the middle. Here's a picture. The two wire mesh layers are twisted up.

My question is which is negative and which is positive? Here's a picture of the Dell connector:
http://i.imgur.com/HOCiCh.jpg

Thanks  
  
  
  
**Update:**  The cord diagram on the Dell psu shows (-) as being the outside braid, and (+) as the inside braid, and an unlabeled terminal as the center pin. I've gathered that the center pin is used by some controller on the motherboard to determine the type of psu.  The Mac psu also has a third terminal that I hadn't noticed before (you can see in the first pic above a thin grey wire perpendicular to the red wire).

So, knowing the correct polarity of the Dell wires and confident it wouldn't blow anything up, I connected all three and plugged it in.

Now, I've used the google machine, and came up with nothing useful. Closest was a [360 rotating surge protector](http://www.amazon.com/360-Electrical-36035-W-4-Outlet-Protector/dp/B001O4BN48/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343073249&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=360+receptacle). It's possible that I am not using the proper terminology when searching...

Ideally it would be a free spinning device, i.e. the receptacle would be set into a ball bearing or similar design.

* Am I using the wrong terminology? If so, what could I use to make my search experience more successful?
* Perhaps there is such a device that one of you know of, or where I can bastardize some such device. Links maybe?

92,[Fluid Dynamics problem] Hey engineers. I have an enigma that I hope you can help with.,1343018543,"Hello, fellow engineers. I have a fluid dynamics question for you. I have a project where I need to generate anaerobic conditions for some biodegradation. However, I am having trouble controlling the water head level while keeping the system devoid of oxygen. The soil media we are using has a higher hydraulic conductivity than the system’s set flow rate and consequently the tank drains rather than floods. Therefore, to flood the system and prevent any air from remaining in the media pore space, a very basic sump system was created. 

The existing sump system works well in controlling the water table level in the tank, but is unfortunately introducing air into the effluent line. It seems that the water flowing through the “T” connection is sucking in air through the open port. The open port can’t be eliminated entirely as plugging the open port seems to create a vacuum and drains the tank simply as before. The effluent line leads to another anaerobic tank, and therefore any oxygen in the system is undesirable.

So my question to you smart engineers is how I can introduce atmospheric pressure to flood the tank without re-introducing air into the system? Is there any existing system already out there that accomplishes what I am trying to do that I can look at? And also, what is happening to cause air to get sucked into the “T” connection. Is it a difference in pressures?

An illustration of the current system is below. Any help is greatly, greatly appreciated.

8,Want to calculate time lag in pressure sensing line,1342827646,"So here's my problem:

One of the engineering packages I'm working on involves relocating some pressure switches. To spare the details, I have a pressure switch which will be monitoring the hydraulic pressure of a valve. When a signal comes in, the valve's hydraulic pressure will dump, and the valve will start to close. My pressure switch needs to sense the drop in pressure no later than 20ms AFTER the valve begins to move. We have a manufacturer given setpoint, but no detailed analysis showing how they correlated time and pressure, which is ok because we somewhat regularly hook up an astro-med and verify we meet our response time requirement.

I'm putting together a package to move the switches from their current location (mounted to the valve), to a different structural support, and I'm going to be installing 20"" of 1/4"" SS316 flexible tubing between the switch and the pressure tap, and I'd really like to have an idea of how that tubing will affect the length time time it takes for my pressure switch to sense the drop in fluid pressure. 

It's not critical that I have an analysis, as we are going to perform a response time test at rated fluid temp/pressure before we accept the changes, and I already know two other organizations who did something very similar w/no issues, but I'm recognizing that I don't know how to calculate the time lag involved, and I'd like to have some rough calculation showing I'm good before installation testing (it's really just good practice).

I enjoyed doing aerodynamics, and would like to shift to a career where that is a large portion of what I do. My question is how do I get there from here, and here's the options I can come up with:

1) Look for entry positions doing what I want, hopefully I'll eventually get one.    - I still do this every now and then, but it gets quite depressing to spend 30 minutes on an application and then hear nothing back (even a rejection letter would be nice). 


2) Go back to school and get my Masters. - This option is hard because I don't want more loans. School costs money, and undergrad loan takes about half my paycheck. 


3) Try to use the QC job in civil to get to a QC job in Aero and hope to move up into where I want to be.   - I've also tried this, but have heard nothing. I'm not entirely sure what jobs would be the best to apply or the best way to switch fields. Any advice?


4) Keep working/saving and try to start my own doing something. Wind turbines interest me, perhaps starting a company dealing with that would be profitable. I might also do this ""on paper"", having designs and give the appearance of work to get experience in the field.  -Thinking more and more of doing this just because it lets me do what I want, and I think the worst outcome would be that I end up with a failed company and work experience in the field. Hopefully that would translate into a job.

18,Help with hacking a window A/C unit for controls,1342738102,"A few months ago my co-worker decided he could convert a window A/C unit to super chill methanol. Well it works, exceptionally well (-40C). 

Now that I've been using it for a while I decided it would be really nice to be able to control it so I could have a set point. 

So here's the issue:

**Problem**
Need to control power to compressor. The current thermostat works by measuring air temperature. It has a limit to 60. Would need to hack it to go to any setpoint and modify the thermocouple to accept a voltage input

**Known**
We have a wire diagram taken from a similar A/C unit they're working on:

[Link to Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/kpYnc.jpg?2755)

So we can see in the bottom right corner is the block for the compressor. It appears to be running on single phase 120v using a split phase capacitor for startup

It looks like the relay is the best point of modification

**Solution Ideas**

Looking at the red wire I see a N.O. (normally open) switch. I followed this on the board and it is indeed a relay. I measured a 120v drop across the relay while open, and when closed measured 0v as expected. 

I'm fairly positive this is the A/C units method of controlling temperature. When the Temp is higher than the setpoint it activates the relay, turning on the compressor.

The idea now is to hack into the existing relay providing my own 12v excitation source

**Questions**
Does this all make sense? Am I overlooking something obvious in the sake of simplicity? 


**Update**

With your help I've decided to use the existing relay an provide my own 12v source to power it. This keeps the majority of the system in tack. 




I've gathered some information, the most important being the part number of the relay

The yellow line and the pink line I'm assuming are the switching line. I'm thinking the yellow line is 12v from the transformer and the pink line is the ground switch on the transistor chip.

Basically it is to stop the weather from affecting the saxophone during my marching band sessions but there is one problem with it.

I have thought of putting flaps that will go across the hole but still let me put my hands in there. I want more input though. So If you can think of a solution for this, I would love to hear it.

20,Graduated with a mechanical engineering degree. Feeling rather lost about where to go from here.,1342733738,"First off, I'm not sure if this is the right place to find job related advice, but I figured I'd start here.

I attended University of Michigan and got my degree in 4 years. My grades are pretty good (GPA is about a 3.3) but I don't have much experience to go along with it. Schoolwork was dominating my free time and the thought of joining an engineering student group wasn't very attractive to me, even if it would have been smart to do in hindsight. Also don't have any relevant work experience. I didn't exactly flip burgers during the summer. I had a couple IT / computer related jobs, but they don't exactly apply to engineering.

When graduation came (April 2011, so over a year ago), I had a couple interviews but they didn't lead to much. I was slightly paralyzed by not knowing what exactly I wanted to do nor where I wanted to end up. I coasted through the summer and ended up spending a winter being a snowboard instructor. I had the time of my life, but now I'm finding it hasn't made the job search any easier. It just delayed everything, and now I'm getting paranoid because I haven't done any actual engineering-related work in over a year. 

And I just don't know where to turn to even begin looking for jobs. I've got a general idea of stuff that interests me (environmental / energy related stuff but design also interests me greatly), but short of browsing the internet for companies to apply to, I'm lost. I had a friend find an engineering job through Monster.com, but I just browsed around and it seems like a complete crapshoot for ever finding a relevant job. 

I don't know. I'm not asking for a step by step guide to finding a job or anything, but does anyone have any words of wisdom? It's all just very overwhelming and I don't know where to go from here.

I do have a friend at a company that's currently hiring, and he offered to help me out. The problem is that it's in an industry I'm not very interested in and I'd have to move to a place that I'm not crazy about either.

A strong understanding of physics and math is something I feel every real engineer should have as I feel engineering is applying scientific principals to solve problems and/or create new things. I do not see this at all with most software programmers, and feel like all programming is is memorizing a couple (or many) different sets of completely arbitrary ""logic"" that was written by someone else. I would say that people who are designing/writing analysis, CAD, calculation software, etc. such as Matlab, Solidworks, FEHT, etc. are engineers, however people who simply make websites, flash games, etc. aren't.

Surprisingly, when it comes to building a rocket launcher, the thing that has me stumped is how to make fins that can fold into and pop out of the rocket. The thing making this hard is that they have to be connected to servos, and the servos have to remain stationary. I've thought up a couple concepts, but none of them seem very reliable.

After explaining the basics of electricity and circuit schematics, he came to me with the pieces of a [shake flashlight](http://bryankollar.com/shopping/images/shakelight.jpg). He wants to turn it into a cell phone charger.


I'm super proud of him and want to keep encouraging this creative desire while trying to gently tell him that the coil will probably not bring in much for wattage. His reponse? He goes to Radioshack and comes back with [magnet wire](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2036277) and a neodymium magnet half the size of my pinky finger. This little dude kicks ass!


Anyway, we're about to wrap the coil and I realized I'm not quite so sure of myself as I thought. I haven't got a clue the best way to wrap this wire, and I have no idea how to best test this coil once we get it working!


I have only basic tools available to me. Most of what I have I've stripped out of household electronics. I have capacitors, diodes, motors, LEDs, resistors and all those goodies but *no oscilloscope* and only a janky little multimeter to work with. (Yeah I know, my tools suck. I lost a lot of stuff to chlorine gas recently and I'm rebuilding my tool set)


To determine the maximum power output of the coil, I was thinking of building [this circuit](http://i.imgur.com/Xs7BT.jpg) and measuring at the three marked points as the bro shakes the coil - pretty standard, but I'm worried about diode losses and capacitive losses as unknown factors. Depending on how much voltage/amperage we can get out of this coil, I will buy the necessary components from DigiKey (if the voltage is high, we go with a 7805. If the voltage is low, we build a simple boost converter) and go from there.

38,Thermo question - Is it a good idea to calculate the power requirements of an AC based on how *fast* you want the temperature dropped?,1342619443,"Quick thermodynamics question... when calculating the power requirement of an AC system for a house when the rate of heat loss is unknown, is it sufficient to base the calculations on how fast you want the house to be cooled from temp A to temp B (I'll use 100 F and 60 F as my example temperatures) assuming no heat loss?  Or perhaps assuming a typical value?

Also, does it make more sense to make calculations this way in general?  It seems to me that if you calculate the required power based on what's required to *maintain* the desired temperature given a known heat loss, I would think that would yield an underpowered system that would take a long time to actually drop the temperature from 100 F to 60 F.  This would be further magnified once you factor in the loss of performance that always occurs after a few years of ownership.

I wonder if it would be better to calculate the required power based on the time you think it should take to cool the house from, let's say, 100 F to 60 F.  If we say we want this process to take no more than 30-45 minutes, I would think that would leave you with a nicely powered system that can easily handle the expected performance drop over time.  

But would doing this yield an overly expensive overpowered system?  Or is this a good way to do the calculations?

I graduated from a prestigious engineering school in May and applied to this company seeking an entry level position. They wanted to hire me to grow a new branch in the next state over and I was the only candidate they were interviewing for the position. 

Initially I was hesitant to move but after visiting the out of state office I realized how nice it was there and told the head of the out of state office that I would like to take the job, he called the main office and told them the good news and I set up a meeting with the president of the company (who handles all the hiring) to discuss the job terms.

When I went in I was offered a 10th percentile hourly pay rate, over $8,000 less than what the average hiring rate was for my graduating class. Even taking benefits into account the offer was extremely low. I was told a different (higher) yearly salary total than what the hourly actually comes out to. 

The president said secretary would send me the job offer, I said that be would great, and that all I had to do was sign it and start next week. The president proceeded to introduce me to everyone in the office and even tells the IT guy to make me an email account, double checking the spelling of my name.

When I get the written offer by email I crunch the numbers and realize the year end total is nearly $2000 less than what was discussed in the meeting. 

I sent a respectful email after talking to my adviser and career services restating my reasons as to why I deserve a higher hourly rate including higher cost of living in other state, the fact that they claimed my peers at higher rates are salaried (they mostly aren't) and what I was asking for was still low (40th percentile, roughly $5000 more, still extremely low for the area I'd be moving to).

I'm a grad student working in a lab and I need a few steel blocks to use as rough spacers on a piece of equipment I'm working with.

Dimensions needed are ~5/8"" by ~.75"" by ~2"" and no need for high precision. Say something like +/- 1/16"" would be just fine for my needs, and honestly the length (2"") isn't even that important; something like +/- 3/8"" would be OK there.

I have access to a machine shop but would have to wait a few days for my turn in line, and it would probably cost more than necessary - I figure there ought to be someplace online that I can order rough-cut steel blocks for cheap.

I could make an engine that runs, but I wouldn't know how to maximize output except by guess and test.



I want to order some parts from a machine shop in order to make a sealed piston and cylinder, with a moving rod in the center as well. There will be large temperature swings and pressures might be 100's of PSI.


I discovered that many cylinder seals are already available online, and they aren't that expenseive. What I want to know, is how do I make/specify a cylinder and piston that will be usable with standard piston/cylinder seals? Would it be easier to buy pre-made cylinders and pistons? I'm not sure where to start.


Is there some sort of online parts resource that makes this easy?





Second question:


If I have a 1m in diameter and 2m tall cylinder that I can compress to 1000 PSI, and I have water flowing over it to remove the heat and or cold as it compresses and decompresses, how much energy can I store in and reasonably get out of that cylinder?



On a side note I plan on using the energy stored in the cold water that is a byproduct of this to cooling action to cool the water for the cold side of the stirling engine. The hot water may also be used as a heat source at night for the hot side of the engine.

-Vital power lines with no access panels/tiny access panels, so if you need to check or repair them, you have to practically dismantle the wing

Here are some of my thoughts on this and what I think should happen.

I am about to graduate with an undergraduate degree in civil engineering. I am also really into electronic music production and have dabbled with programming. I have always found engineering calculations on mathcad or matlab to be dry and I don't think it should be that way. I don't think it makes sense for me to be in a cubicle all day just focusing on using some of my senses (vision) to get my work done. I sort of envision an integrated calculation environment where there is an AI running in the background that aids with calculations(something like what you see with debugging in visual studio), points out connections, and at least makes different sound for different parts of the spread sheet. This would make it more experiential and leave more of a presence in my mind. I think it would only help the engineer making the calculations as it would keep their attention and give them more senses to work with. I also think this would help engineering students as it would bring the calculations to life. Also, I am a human being and i want there to be some color to what i am designing and at least feel engaged and not numb. 

I also want to point something else out. I think engineering projects could benefit from taking user interfaces seen in strategy games (like command and conquer) and actually showing spread sheets of work on a map like that. It makes use of peoples intuitive spacial sense and would be the most natural way to organize such files. When ever i work on projects i find that placing everything in file locations and accessing them with a file browser is just an eye sore and is terribly inefficient. 
Another idea would be like using the xbox connect controller to manage files and interface with the computer. I will be honest, I hate the mouse.
The reason i have thought about this is because when i started paying attention to how i worked in a virtual environment, my grades went up. A lot. I realized that syncing calenders, getting dropbox, and getting an iphone really put you ahead and save time. Since I work in the field of engineering, I naturally still want all of this to be better and I think that this is the direction that the engineering profession is going to take.

tl;dr can we make engineering design  faster, better, more communicable, and more fun with better computer aided environments?

liquid to gas, it much easier to combust gas in an internal combustion engine rather than having to mix air and liquid together.

In a month I will have a master's degree in psychology (that's right), but I reconsidered my path and decided to change (or broaden) qualifications. I always loved\was pretty good at physics so I decided to go to a Technical University in Poznań (I'm from Poland). 

I wanted to study Power Engineering to get some sort of job in ecological energy (preferably solar power or wind turbines). That was my plan, but my candidacy wasn't accepted. I was also rejected from Mechanical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Mechatronics, however, I was accepted to Technical Physics, which is on the same university, and I'd also get an engineering degree there. BUT! This faculty is more theoretical and scientific than others, and for some reason it's not very popular among students and candidates.

There are 3 specializations to choose from on Technical Physics:

* Nanotechnology and functional materials (like LCD etc)
* Computer Simulations
* Laser Technologies and measurment instruments

The university claims that graduates can find jobs in:

* laboratories using nanomaterials, high-tech micro-electronics, optoelectronics, quantum engineering
* high-tech research facilities
* medical and scientific measurments
* computer systems management, general industry, trade, production, banking.
 
Can you verify this? What do graduates do, where do they get jobs, DO they get good/interesting jobs? In fact, can you tell me ANYTHING about Technical Physics?

And the main question here is: should I stay on Technical Physics OR should I try to apply to paid studies in Power or Mechanical Engineering? (in Poland tertiary education is for free, but if there are too many candidates and you are rejected you can try to apply to the paid version of the studies. It's easier to get accepted there)

16,Locate the fault in a partially parallel transmission lines [Electrical Engineering],1342081712,"Here is the example of a partially parallel transmission line. The main task here is to find the ""m"", where fault occur.

3phase:
V= 3X1 matrix
I= 3X1 matrix
Z= 3X3 matrix

By using the same method I've used in a normal parallel transmission line. I'm stuck at this stage, as there is unknown ""Vr1 and Vr2"" in my equation.

Concerning the phase component only, Z11 &amp; Z22, Z12 &amp; Z21(mutual coupling), I1 &amp; I2, Vs , l are known.

But the Vr1, Vr2, Vf, m here are unknown.

So, the second image here is some derivation that I've done. However, I am stuck at the ""green"" highlighted part.
I do not know what are the Vr1 and Vr2 [as there is ""If"" containing inside the equation]. If I can get the Vr1 and Vr2 value, then I can simply get the ""If"" value and then multiply the complex conjugate of ""If"" into the Vs equation. By comparing the imaginary part only, then I can straight away get the ""m"" value.

this way works when it's a normal parallel line, but it won't work here as there are unknown Vr1 and Vr2 in my final equation. maybe my method is wrong or I'm totally out of the correct path in getting it.

I'm hoping to get some guides and help from you guys here.

17,"I'm a senior EE and I have an extremely low GPA (2.13), but I've also got 2 years of engineering experience and a Sob Story. Do I even have a chance at getting a decent job?",1342061511,"Reddit, 

I have a horribly low GPA (2.13).  I have struggled through all of my classes and had to retake a good deal of them.  

I've also worked 25+ hours/week throughout my entire college career. By the time I graduate (May 2013) I will have worked at a HVAC engineering company for two years as a Line Engineer and Electrical Engineer in training (I have been trained, but not yet promoted but they are hinting at a promotion soon).  I got the job as a summer internship, but since it is located in the same town as my univeristy I managed to make myself indespensible and they allowed me to work there on night shift while i finish my degree.  I currently work directly under the vice president of the company and have a good working relationship with him.

I don't want to stay at the company I'm at because they have a complete lack of fucks to give to any and all of their employees. Because a large portion of their manufacturing employees are unskilled workers or worse (many are ex-convicts) they treat everyone like drugged up teenagers who have to be babysat non-stop.  I see huge issues in their business practices and engineering practices, but I've also seen people point out those issues and find themselves fired. 

I come from a family who has no technically capable people in it other than me and my younger brother and from a high school that barely taught the basics, so I found that many of the things that came naturally to my classmates were a struggle to me. Combine that with a complete lack of time due to having to work so much just to stay in school and I have my shitty GPA.  Every job I have ever been at I have been bored out of my skull (including my current job as a line engineer) due to lack of challenging things to work on.  I have always excelled at work and try very hard to be the best at my job (whether it was carhopping at sonic or designing a wire mapping system for large HVAC systems).  I was taught that the way to ensure that you are never fired is to make yourself indespensible.  

I'm overwhelmingly afraid that companies will look at my GPA and pass me over for jobs that I would be awesome at!

Our university is rather small, so there won't be as many companies there that I'd like, but I have a game plan for the career fair coming in October:
1. Have my resume primed and ready. Know it inside and out. It will be unique, but readable.  I will have it printed on a nifty folder and hand it out as swag for the recruiters to use to hold all of the resumes they collect for the day.  On the outside will a diagram outlining why I would be a good employee. On the inside will be lists of my skills and job experiences.
2.  Apply ahead of time for every electrical or software related job I can find on the job sites for all engineering companies on the list for the career fair.
3. Create and have on hand a portfolio of past work and experiences to show at the career fair if necessary (I'd like to save it for the interview, but hell if I have to whip it out at the fair I'll do it to get an interview).  
4.  Firm Handshake (I've been complimented for mine).
5.  Have questions ready ahead of time for each and every company that might be interested in me. I will overlook no company and, if possible, will know what each company's future goals are. (Many companies post press releases with such information).  
If I am not offered an interview by the time the career fair recruiter is wrapping up our conversation I will ask outright.  

Do I even have a chance at a decent job with my GPA, though, or should I be lucky that I got the job I have?

EDIT: Thanks so much for the responses! I have never actually gotten this many people to respond to anything on reddit before.  Its really encouraging that I still have a shot. Without trying to be egotistical, I can say that I know that I am a very good employee and all of my project experience points to me also being a good engineer.

20,"Co-op time! Where might a ""non-standard"" guy like myself look for employment beyond the obvious contacts that the coop office maintains?",1342053615," I'm looking to co-op starting any time after the end of this summer. I'm flexible and can make any time work. I can go anywhere as long as some sort of lodging can be worked out. I would ideally like to work for a full year with one awesome company, or work for two 6-month stretches with two very different awesome companies (in that case, ideally one of them would be R&amp;D and the other would be more practical work, so I can get a better perspective of the engineering field as a whole). I would love to meet a lot of new friends (I'm a very social individual who will converse with anyone about any subject) and make connections with incredible people that I could enjoy working with after uni. If I don't end up working at the same place, then I want to have at least picked up some usefull skills, made some good friends, and been more beneficial than detrimental in my contribution to their cause. I need to work for a full year in order to have enough money to finish school. However, money is not nearly as important to me as learning, meeting new people, and doing the best I possibly can at whatever I happen to be doing.

I'm a second year senior in mechanical engineering bachelor studies. I'm two years into the four, but did some extra work and played tetris with my schedule so I could theoretically graduate in one more year (assuming I can find out what's going on with a chemistry placement test that no one informed me would be required when I entered the program). If I don't get out in three years then I'll stretch it to four and try to fill in the blanks with masters classes offered through our university's biomedical engineering 4+1 masters program.

My primary long term goal is to be the best at me. If I know who I am, who I want to be, and am achieving my potential in every possible way, then I'll excel no matter what I'm doing.
My secondary long term goal is to facilitate awesomeness. I want to either own or direct a company or organization that creates new ideas or brings together existing ideas in innovative ways to shape the future of humanity. I want to learn how to say ""this is the next big technological breakthrough"" and know how to get the right people, resources, and infrastructure together to make it happen.
My view is that world exists solely as a medium for me to do incredible things and make something of lasting value out of myself, those around me, and my environment.

My true passion is bringing together ideas, tools, techniques, and technologies that, at first glance, seem unrelated to solve problems, or create something entirely bizarre and elegantly effective. I love keeping a wide view of a situation, and using perspectives of other fields to find a novel approach to a situation. I enjoy searching through an infinite number of possibilities in order to find something that gives me an edge to leverage the effectiveness of my current project.
I'm not the best eidetic test-eating number-crunching honors student, but I've always worked well with them as I can find solutions outside their focus and spend the rest of the time picking up slack anywhere possible so as to not be a burden.


My interests are pretty much everything. One of my main annoyances in life is that I don't have enough bodies to keep up with all the things my consciousness wants to do. I had a bit of trouble choosing a major for engineering because I wanted to do everything and avoid getting ""stuck"" in something. I chose mechanical engineering for my studies, not because I just wanted to work on mechanical things, but because I wanted to be able to explain any dynamic system in a manner that is practical and tangible. I'm not in it for a ""license to work""; I want to build a knowledge base and a set of analytical tools that will be useful no matter what I'm doing. Mechanical engineering has just always seemed the most tangible in my experience. People in many fields default to physical dynamic analogies to explain a concept (e.g. circuits explained through fluid dynamics), and I want to be able to work in a medium that is present and easily communicable.
As far as jobs/tech, I'd like to work in anything that can hold my interest and actually make an impact on humanity: Human Augmentation (artificial organs, reliable and inexpensive prostheses for humanitarian programs), Human-Machine Interface (sensory bypass, various neural scanning techniques to produce useful outputs, developing a system of protocols for neural I/O and Intercranial communication. I want to be the first person to bring the iPsy to market), Energy Production/Management/etc. (I would love to work on a prototype for a free-market SMART Grid that allows individuals to participate in the energy market on their own terms), Defense (either by improving weapons deployment and control to minimize cases of collateral damage to civilians and nearby civilian infrastructure, or by improving the ability of the military to rapidly deploy medical aid to disaster areas), Home Utility Cogeneration (I want to develop compact and efficient units that can use stirling engines and other versatile technologies to perform water heating, air conditioning, emergency power generation, and basically anything else that could be crammed into a single compartment while being easy to maintain), Open Source Vehicles (I want to develop and sell a barebones vehicle that is safe, economical, and efficient, but is designed to be very cheap and easy to fix while maintaining standardized modular format that will allow any third-party to produce specialized components in a manner inspired by modern personal computer design), Educational Advancement (I want to combine and contribute to many of the recent advances in utilizing technology to improve education, and develop a more streamlined and efficient way of educating university students, especially engineers, while making classes more mobile and accessible. I would very much like to test some of my concepts for non-time-dependent education), and far too many others. If it's interesting and something that will break new ground then I want to do it.

I want to do something that is the antithesis of boring and recursive. I don't want to make the same thing slightly better for 20 years, I want to create something that will make those 20 years nothing like the years before it.

I want to face a lot of new challenges and work with a group that handles a wide variety of projects with something new to explore every day.

I want to be immersed in a creative community from whom I can absorb knowledge, perspective, and good engineering practice. I can work pretty much anywhere and get something out of it, but I really want to work with people who think the way I do or at least are complementary to and complemented by the way I think. Does anyone know of any smaller outfits who do incredibly awesome or obscure-because-no-one-else-is-awesome-enough-to-comprehend-it work? I absolutely must work with someone who is creative, imaginative, and doesn't afraid of anything.


Where can an oddball like me fit in? Are there places where screwballs like me congregate, and somehow actually manage to accomplish things?

28,Venturi Vacuum Help,1342017151,"So we currently mix two liquids (one is water, and the other is basically dish soap) by weight (1% soap by weight).  Currently, we have the operators fill a large tub (lets say a 55 gallon drum) with the desired amount of water, they then go to a chart and add the correct amount of soap.  We use large enough quantities that these are pumped into the drum.  This is both time consuming, and not all the operators are as careful following the chart.


My idea to eliminate the error is to use a venturi vacuum.  I want to just be able to fill the drum to the desired amount, but the flowing in water is using a venturi to form a vacuum and automatically suck in the soap.  Is this a consistent way of doing this?  I can regulate the velocity/pressure of the water with a simple regulator, so that shouldn't be an issue.  


Any way I can be pointed in the right direction for even the initial venturi I can do a trial with, that will give me a ""close-enough"" mix ratio to test?


And just a side question.  Say the pressure/velocity is unable to be kept constant.  Will the venturi provide a vacuum that is proportional to the velocity of the water going through it?  Ex. if I'm pumping at 10 gallons/min, and that allows for 1 gallon/min of soap, does that mean if I'm pumping at 50 gallons/min, do I get 5 gallons/min of soap?",AskEngineers,SpecialTest,/r/AskEngineers/comments/wdwnw/venturi_vacuum_help/

43,Thoughts on a UAV design and learning.,1341882427,"I've been meaning to get into electronics for a long time and more often than not the ubiquitous UAV comes up as an ideal first project to learn many of the basics. The fact that I'm an aviation and space nut is just a bonus!

I know that putting together pre-made kits is one way of learning some of the basics, but personally I've always felt that I learn more by designing and building something from scratch. Unfortunately, I also always seem to make things difficult for myself by (unintentionally) over complicating things because of a lack of knowledge. Just the other night I was thinking about how to use magnetic bearings to get higher performance out of propeller systems, and after several hours of research, I realised that I had ended up re-inventing the brushless motor :D

Anyway, I've been looking into UAVs and noticed that most, if not all, rely on the direct thrust provided by the propellers to maneuver. This obviously works well and since there is a lot of information already available, is probably the way I'll end up going.

However, all that being said, I've been thinking of a potential UAV design which uses EDFs, or a similar ducted system to drive a centrifugal impeller (I'm really showing how little I know about these systems! I assume that the thrust produced by the EDF would turn the impeller? Possibly it would be more practical to skip the EDF and just directly drive the impeller itself?). Either way, the goal of this would be to then take the pressurized thrust produced and channel it into a manifold system which would then redistribute the total available thrust to various thrust reaction ""nozzles"" (for want of a better word) according to the needs required to fly and perform manuevers.

Someone on another forum raised the very valid point of an overall net loss of thrust, so I wondered if it would be feasible to have some sort of pressure container between the impeller and the manifold to act as a thrust ""buffer"", which could also act as a reservoir / bleed off system when not needed for thrust. Potentially any excess stored pneumatic energy could drive other components, like a mini air driven turbine (don't know if this exists!) to generate and feedback extra current to the batteries, or other onboard electronics?

As for actual physical design, I've considered a central saucer shape with multiple intakes, or a more simple central single intake, a la the [Avrocar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_VZ-9_Avrocar). I think the single intake would be a lot easier (assuming it would provide the required airflow).

I have to have a disclaimer that I am *not* an engineer, or even a terribly technically capable person, and I know this idea might be a bit odd, and probably isn't viable, or practical, but I enjoy challenges and the learning that comes with them, plus I think designing and building something a little bit different from scratch will help me to learn more than just copying existing designs.

I'm just wondering if anybody has any good suggestions for position sensors to measure the distance (max distance in the order of 1mm) between two flowtubes.  It should be able to survive and measure vibrations at 100 - 1000 Hz.  I'm hoping to be able to detect phase differences that are a fraction of a degree, so it has to be fast.

I'm only a year in so far, so I'd like to pin down as much as possible while I'm stuck at CC finishing off the transfer requirements to UCI.

I've told my supervisor (a different person than the team lead) about working with other groups, but he's just pointed me back to stick with the same group.  I think several people have left the group in the past.

I've spent about a few months researching a new line of research, and not too long ago I presented it to my team lead (got to go through chain of command right?).  Since then, I've been writing proposals and powerpoint presentations for it, and he's been putting his name on it and presenting the work with me, with his name first and my name second.  It was a practice that I didn't really like, but I went along with it anyway in hopes I could get funding from management.

So is there a scientific engineering reason for this, or at least a practical reason?

The interview process was very difficult and competitive (Multiple interviews on campus as well as on location which pitted you directly against other students).  I had heard from friends and other students that if you were lucky enough to get the job, you would love it and learn tons. During the interview process they had shown presentations of past intern's work and various projects (all of which seemed interesting, engaging, and a good test of skill for a newly developing engineer). I was excited to say the least when I learned I was one of approx. 35 kids who were chosen out of thousands for the internship.

When I got the job all I knew was that I was going to be relocating from the far North-East to the South-West and would be working on improving some of their manufacturing processes; great I thought!  In between my time of hire and actually starting work I had steady flow of how great Company X's internship program was from their Corporate HR people and am still contacted by them fairly often.

On my first day of work I learned that at my specific location had no engineers on site, no engineering techs, no engineering anything, not even a maintenance department.  It was just a small manufacturing facility with a few supervisors and a small workforce of skilled &amp; unskilled laborers. If anything went wrong, they called in outside help.  Not anything like what I had be sold on, but I thought to myself, ""I could work with this; just more room for improvement to make myself look good.""

This is where my problem starts, when I met my boss he had said I would be doing time studies my entire summer.  ""Eh, not the best job,"" I thought, ""I guess I am just one of the interns doing grunt work."" The time studies I am required to do could literally be done by a 3rd grader, no real analysis is done other than the average time it takes a laborer to build a part. After a month+ doing solely time studies I contacted some other interns (none are in my area most are at Corporate many hours away) and asked about their summer assignments. I found out that they all have similar assignments to what was advertised during the interview process. Some are going on site to learn how a product is installed/used, and are actually working to improve the product, manufacture of said product, or installation of it. Others are learning actual lean manufacturing methods and applying that knowledge. They are even leading teams working to improve a product or research new technologies. This isn't sitting well with me, and is making me feel like I am getting taken advantage of. It's not that their jobs are ""cooler"" than mine, it's that mine involves zero amount of engineering; literally nothing. I met with my boss and asked if I could work to try and improve some of their manufacturing processes (I have two previous internships as a Process Engineer for other manufacturing companies) and he simply directed me to the suggestion box. I also found out that I am required to give an end-of-assignment presentation in front of the ""higher ups"" and other interns at corporate and fear I will look like a fool because of my mundane assignment compared to everyone else's assignment.

What should I do? I am currently sticking it out and trying my best with this brainless assignment and am not learning anything let alone contributing to the extent of the other interns. Should I go behind my bosses back and contact the HR people from Corporate and bring this to their attention? Should I meet with my boss again? I don't want to be seen as a person who complains *or* a slacker/moron/ect.

15,Question about RF-TX/RX system with multiple transeivers,1341339981,"Edited: Title might be a bit confusing and bad spelling, using multiple transmitter/receiver modules, no transceivers. Sorry

I'm trying to setup a system that has a main controller which sends commands to multiple satellites.  I would like to transmit signals from the controller to the satellite and then relay state data from the satellites back to the controller.  I would like to do this with an RF system due to cost.  I was thinking of using 434MHz RF modules for the controller to satellite and 315MHz modules for satellite to controller.  Each satellite would have an ID and when I wanted to change the state of an individual satellite I would transmit that command with an ID tag. All satellites would receive the transmission but only the satellite that was programmed to respond with such an ID tag would change state.  I would also like to setup a system that ping'd the satellites for state information.  My thought is that since they all have specific ID's, the protocol would be to send out a ping from the controller to all satellites and then have them respond in a sequence, this sequence could be time based or based on inter-satellite transmission (after one satellite transmits it pings the next satellite in order). 

I'm still researching these possibilities but my question to you is more hardware based. Is it possible to have multiple transceivers in a setup like this or would I suffer from to much noise? If not noise, what would be the main inhibitors?

22,"Truss structure. Titanium vs aluminum vs stainless steel. Stiffness, weight, corrosion, price. Discuss pros and cons.",1341275350,"Take a look at this telescope, namely the ""truss"" structure (the 8 long diagonal tubes, I don't know if it's properly called ""truss"") used to hold that little round cage with the secondary mirror way above the primary mirror at the bottom.

The traditional material for the tubes is aluminum. The main requirement is stiffness - the cage must maintain its position relative to the primary box when under lateral force by the user (also under gravity), and do so at various angles between horizon and zenith. Other requirements are total weight (less is better), corrosion resistance (main factor is humidity at night), and price. Thermal dilation is NOT a factor (visual astronomy, you're adjusting things manually all the time anyway, a little dilation is lost in the noise).

I've heard that stainless steel would actually provide better stiffness at the same total weight. That would make sense if you assume that steel is a lot more stiff than aluminum, but not much more heavy. But I don't know if it's true or not.

How about titanium? I assume it's pretty expensive, but beyond that, would it provide better stiffness at the same total weight?

31,How would you go about converting the force/pressure/velocity of a hammer to a microcontroller?,1341236714,"I have 3 options I am currently considering:


1 - Force Sensor

So the force sensor would be straight forward, basically you hit the sensor with the hammer, the sensor produces a voltage and the microcontroller reads that input.


2 - Pressure Sensor

The pressure sensor would be attached to a hose of some sort, and that hose is hit by the hammer. Then the sensor produces a voltage, yada yada.


3 - Velocity Sensor

For the velocity sensor, I was thinking of borrowing the idea from electronic keyboards. How it works is you have 2 sensors that only complete a circuit, space them out so when the hammer hits a lever, there is a time difference between when the 2 contact sensors trigger. Measuring that difference, you compute a velocity, then I suppose I would translate that into the program on the microcontroller as I would do with the voltage.

If any of you have those Orion 7 Hybrid buses in your city you might know what I am talking about.

The glass for those buses are glued onto the metal frame, and have no side support. It is purely the urethane (or something else holding it on).

The company that produces the bus, refuses to sell only the glass, when the glass is broken and forces us to buy the frame along with the glass, which adds up, and adds a lot of waste.

At this point, I am considering finding some AS2 or AS3 glass getting it cut to the correct size, and attaching it. But I want to setup some tests to make sure it is strong enough.

So what should I do? Glue the glass to the frame, leave the frame upside down with some weights on the glass and see how long it holds? Spray the assembly with water and see how long it holds? Heat and cold tests? What kind of tests should I do to make sure the glass is strongly secured.

In other words: I need a mechanism that fulfills the following truth table when the inputs are gear directions (speed matched) and the output is a gear (speed matched to the inputs) that only rotates in 1 direction:

72,Understanding the Vortex Flowmeter,1340830441,"I have a vortex flowmeter from omega engineering, model FV-510C-F-D.  I am using it to measure the flowrate of dry air.

76,How to make the most of a production job (Recent ME grad),1340813418,"Hi all,

I'm a recent mechanical engineering graduate with no prior internship experience and I haven't been able to find a job since graduating in May. Through my network I was offered a production position where I will be assembling water pumps/and other things for 11/hour.  

My question was, what things can I do to maximize this experience and hopefully gain applicable ME experience?  This is by no means what I am looking to do for a career and I will still be actively applying to other positions (my boss said he would be very leniant on giving me time off to interview).

77,ME's Question to EEs About Using Data Logging Systems in Parallel,1340809140,"I'll be running a few tests on two data acquisition devices in a week or so where I'm expecting voltage drops in the low μV range for one of the sensors and the low mV range for the other. My boss would also like me to test out the performance of two different data logging devices as an additional objective while running these tests.

One thought I had, in the interest of saving time, was to take the outputs from the sensors and run them to both of the data logging devices in parallel. This would be nice as I could run the test once, saving myself the second run and also dealing with a single data set for comparison rather than two separate sets. However, one of the guys who will be doing the wiring was concerned that the voltage drop would not distribute evenly to the two logging devices based on their internal circuitry or something along those lines.

So I guess my question to all the Electrical Engineers here is this:

Is there a reasonable chance that I can get good readings in both loggers simultaneously, or will there likely be complications that I'm not anticipating? Based on what little knowledge of circuitry I have, I'd assume that you should get the same voltage drop in each line, is there a reason why this would not be true in this case?

86,Controlling House with Phone (Advice much Appreciated),1340726419,"It's age old but I want to put my spin on things and would like some input. Plus the current technology is a bit expensive. I wan't to try to make significant progress on the project by the end of this summer.


I would like to be able to control the various elements of my house with my phone.  The plan so far is to use arduino's to communicate and control these elements.  Luckily arduino has the capability to relay information to a web server so I could theoretically monitor the system anywhere I go. Eventually I would like to create an application for my android phone as well. 


Biggest hurdle so far for me is the communication within the house. X10 is an established intra-house communication protocol but it seems a bit limited to on/off type communication. I would like greater control so am looking for smarter comm. tech. (i.e. arduino RF communication).  As a mechanical engineer I lack CS knowledge but am hoping to expand my brain matter with this project.


I think I will start with arduino boards as they are relatively cheap and have lots of capability.  With a single arduino master board it would be possible to relay data through RF to smaller slave arduino mini's.  These mini's could flip relays on or off, they also have pwm output but I haven't researched their ""dimming"" capabilities as much as I want to yet.


Since the master would be connected to the web server I would then technically have control of the system wherever I go. 


If all goes well I would like to raise the complexity enormously. Possibly including nfc tags to signal certain events such as unlocking deadbolts, certain theme lighting, certain time/type of day environments (temp, blinds, heating unit, etc.)


My to do list:

-Spec out appropriate Arduino board(s)

-Determine communication protocol, leading towards RF

-Find appropriate RF components

-Build proof of concept circuit

--Find appropriate circuit components (relays etc.)

--Write circuit arduino code

--Expand circuit from wired to wireless

--Test range and sensitivity

--Expand code to comm with multiple satellites

-Revise, make communication protocol secure and robust

-Setup dynamic dns home server

-Create computer control of system

-Create web control of system

-Revise, make secure

-Write phone application

-????

-Profit

Specifically, the objects will range from 20-40"" tall, 2-10"" wide, and 2-10"" deep, and may require strengthening elements to be embedded and/or additional weight added (steel poles/weights, probably). Flexibility isn't a requirement, and would probably cause problems, however while I don't need the material to be extremely strong I do need rigidity (hence the strengthening elements).

It could also just be the utility company wanting the units to cycle so they don't have such a huge draw all at once.

0,Could a smart electrical grid be made open and accessible for free trade and competition at the individual level?,1340501161,"The posts about smart meters got me thinking about an idea I had a while ago (I wanted to study the feasibility in-depth for a research paper competition, but I got very busy and never got back to the idea).

TL;DR: Electricity Stock Market

Could improvements to the electrical grid including more advanced monitoring, routing, and networking allow for a free energy market to exist within the electrical grid?

Would it be possible for every solar panel, wind turbine, etc. to be manufactured with a universally recognizable identification that can be registered with the owner at purchase so that when it is installed in any physical location on the grid (even in isolated portions), it is recognized with a virtual address that can be accessed by the owner through a market interface (much like the more complex broker interfaces used to manage and exchange stocks and other market goods).

It's obviously more complicated than routing signals, but the transaction can still be made between two individuals with the system calculating the effect of the source on the grid and the expected result at the end and provide that information for sales agreements. I'm not sure whether it would be better to attempt to calculate the power drop across a distance, or work out an agreement where the primary utility power is reinforced in one area in exchange for selling an equivalent amount of primary utility power to another area.

The identification could include and route through third-party storage (e.g. a company collects power at peak production and disperses it at peak demand in order to maximize profits for the third-party, and provide the primary utility with more stable production expectations to reduce cycling of supplementary power capacity) and third-party collection/distribution (e.g. a company with available land in a high production location can provide a signal that meets transmission standards with a scalable inverter system that would be more cost effective than individual inverters, while offering solar capacity to investors at a more affordable price than personal installation).

The network could have systems in place for emergencies to automatically route power through safe lines to critical locations. I believe this was one of the original goals of smart grid ""self healing"", but it could be interfaced with the market to connect critical demand locations with individual sources.

One of the great barriers to individual ownership of power production is location and installation. You have to have the available land, the correct conditions, and either the direct access to utility lines at that location or the capacity for self-storage. If you have the available land then you have to pay the full cost of the installation (racking, routing, collection components, inversion components, home modification during installation, inspection, etc.). If systems can be utilized remotely (e.g. producing in a high demand area, and using the revenue to offset the price of power at home) than it could become much more viable to own sources of energy besides fossil fuels or large scale nuclear (I'm not knocking nuclear, but some people don't want it and would utilize alternative sources given the opportunity). Co-ops could be formed anywhere to build capacity in higher demand/production areas with the individual investors able to maintain economic pricing strategies for their portion of the capacity. Areas with high income, but low production of ""green"" energy would have more opportunities to purchase power production to meet their specific economic needs. People living in dorms, apartments, etc. can buy power production capacity that can scale down to fit their budget (e.g. you want to ""go green"" and offset some of your electricity bill, but lack either the space, available natural sunlight/wind/hydro, or capital for a full solar install, so you purchase 300 watts of capacity in a co-operative farm and begin offsetting the cost of the panels and some of your electric bill until you can afford more, eventually owning a remote capacity of ""green"" technology that is equivalent to or greater than your annual usage). This provides manufacturers of alternative energy equipment the ability to do more economic pricing/bundling/etc. than they could when limited to full system installs and customers in high energy production areas. People like me are a prime example of untapped markets. I'm an engineering student living in an apartment in an Appalachian area of Ohio that has neither reliable solar or wind (without government incentives), who doesn't make much, but could use the few hundred I scrape together for some bits of technology or software to buy a panel here and there as an investment instead, assuming I had some way to profit and recoup my investment in the panel over time.

The market system wouldn't necessarily require manual control over power purchase as it could be set to utilize the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour available. This could be disabled when the customer chooses to purchase power from a different supplier. This would appear on both supplier and customer's ends as a system very similar to level 2 market quotes (I wish I had more experience in trading, but unfortunately my experience is limited to buying shares of solar companies through td ameritrade, and I am not familiar with the interfaces of other brokers). Market quotes for bid and ask could be listed (along with a bit more technical information than stocks, such as calculated efficiency between source/demand) along with the owner/company registering the individual equipment supply (e.g. residential scale install) or collection/distribution center supply (e.g. investor capacity solar farms), and the specifics of the technology producing it (e.g. whether the residential scale install is solar, wind, etc., or what combination and percent of produced power is provided in a larger distribution service). This way consumers can make informed decisions about their utility purchases. If a consumer doesn't wish to pay the lower price of primary utility supply in favor of power that is ""green"" or is owned by someone they wish to support, then they can put a bid out for a specific source, or accept a specific ask. They could also use a range of filters to automate  their power purchases according to taste (e.g. purchase ""Solar"" at less than $0.40/KWHr; if none available in range purchase ""Wind"" at less than $0.30/KWHr; if non available in range purchase ""Green(any combination)"" at less than $.20/KWHr; if none available in range purchase ""Primary Utility ('XYZ Power' in your region)"" at market price).
Passing legislation for green energy would be less of an issue as consumers can vote directly with their funds in the sector of the market they demand instead of trusting the legislative branch to accurately gauge a perception of their demand.

Could anyone, from a single mother in an apartment building to a student in a dorm, own utility production capacity and maintain control over it's usage remotely?

Can utility ownership, at an individual level, be as viable as buying/renting a server or server capacity and hosting a website?

2,Electric Engineers - A question about my home's electrical setup.,1340495567,"Please bear with me as I try to explain this.

I'm currently living at my parent's house in lebanon. Long story short, corrupt government + 15 year civil war = electricity rationing. People only get power from the government for 12 hours a day. For the other 12 hours, people pay the local 'generator guy' for power. My family is lucky enough to be able to afford our own generator. So this is the problem.

(note: I'm not familiar with alot of electrical terminology so I will try my best to explain what I mean. Feel free to ask me to rephrase something if I'm not making any sense.)
The generator is a three-phase system, as is our house. The generator has 3 lines, each of which can support a maximum of 30 amps. The way the electrical system in the house is setup is this. Each appliance/outlet is connected to one of the 3 lines. For example. All the AC units are connected to one line, while the washer/dryer and water pumps are on another line.

Occasionally, the generator will turn off because of an overload. When we check the control unit, the load is always very imbalanced. For example, one line would have 28-29 amps (on the brink of overload), while the second one would be just 2 amps, and the third would be 10 or so amps.

Is there anyway we can install some sort of 'load-balancer'? This hypothetical unit would be one extra step in between the generator and the house. It would detect how much total amps are currently in demand, and evenly distribute them between the 3 lines. This would be far more efficient than the current system, and would allow us to turn more things on.

Does such a thing exist? Does this post make any sense whatsover? I wanted to post in r/electricalengineering but that subreddit is dead.",AskEngineers,HypnoToadIsKing,/r/AskEngineers/comments/vi4g1/electric_engineers_a_question_about_my_homes/

4,Ways to alter 'Smart Meter' data/measurements,1340473074,"This is purely hypothetical, as our area isn't due to get them any time soon. However, let's presume I'm about to get a Smart Meter installed in my house, and I object to the data collection. What could be done?


My first thoughts: get a large UPS and run my electronics through it, which should make it much more difficult to figure out what's on the other side of the UPS supply.


Next thoughts: open the Smart Meter and determine how it's collecting info, then play man-in-the-middle and truncate the data (this one may put you in legal hot water)


I've seen intercom systems that work by modulating the AC signal in a house. Perhaps something similar that could introduce 'noise' in the collected data?


EDIT - I am not talking about 'hacking' the meter to avoid paying for electricity. I'm talking about the privacy concerns raised by someone monitoring your power usage, and ways to garble the power usage pattern without changing the overall kWh totals.


EDIT EDIT - After doing more research and talking with tomalakborg, I've found **smart meters are no big privacy threat.** The purpose of the meters is to give the power company more control over a precious commodity, and it helps them in many ways:

* Power companies can determine vital information like voltage, current flow, and other statistics which they previously only knew from one end of the power circuit. It takes a lot of the guesswork out of providing power.
* Power companies can get critical information about peak usage - the entire power grid is designed to handle the peak power draw, the rest of the day is gravy. By knowing more about what regions demand peaks, when and how, they'll be able to better deliver peak power without waste.
* Power companies can get important information about usage - if a business installs a big shiny wall of refrigerators and blows the 30-kilowatt transformer at the pole, the power company can know it was a draw issue and replace it with a 50-kilowatt unit instead of blowing a second 30-kilowatt unit and then have to investigate who's using so much juice.
* Consumers can feel safe - because the meter is measuring power draw on an hourly or daily basis, it's nearly impossible to determine anything important about the house aside from what's already known on a monthly meter reading. That aside, electricity market is heavily regulated, so heads would roll if power usage info were sold to corporations.
* Consumers also have access to this information! It's not just the power company that can benefit from it. Homeowners can know their power usage and have access to it themselves, which for many is a great way to pinch pennies. It also empowers consumers to use more off-peak power, which helps everyone.


**TL;DR** I'm still concerned, because any recording device in my home is still *a recording device in my home.* However, the Smart Meter as currently used is a tiny privacy threat if any - while the possible benefits are tremendous for the power companies and for the consumers. This is a step in the right direction. I'm not too optimistic about what these meters might look like in 2022, but for now I'm OK with the idea.",AskEngineers,Amadameus,/r/AskEngineers/comments/vhmtc/ways_to_alter_smart_meter_datameasurements/

We have a calculation another company made, however I do not understand a few things:

1) For the roof member (beam) they use 2""x4""x1/4"" arbitrarily however for the life of me I cannot find a shape that would give an I value of ""5.31 in^4"". This is needed in order to find the bending stress so I am confused, as well as unable to find a source for aluminum beams.

**COST PROHIBITIVE** *(but darn good)* **OPTIONS** - Services such as those that inject the masonry cavities with spray foam insulation, or those that add rigid insulation to the interior or exterior walls are just way too prohibitive.  Often 10% the cost of the house.  

**My** *(humble)* **idea** - Get reflective attic foil/bubble wrap, hide them in fabric for aesthetics, and hang them as shade curtains from the eaves of the house, covering the walls.  

**The Glitch** - The eaves, and therefore the shades hanging from them, jut out 3ish feet from the walls thereby not creating the 'seal' that a new wall mentioned above would.  Though radiation is being reflected, light is still hitting the walls from the sides/angles that the shades don't face which (obviously) means that radiation is getting to them as well.  Also the walls are still in contact with the 110 degree air that blows between the shades and the walls.

motorcycle (building it with an Arduino) and could use some help
selecting an appropriate MOSFET and MOSFET Driver for driving the turn signals.

Some details:

* Each side is switched as one unit, so I will be passing current
through 2 turn signal lights (12V, 10W, 0.83A) and one dash
illuminator light (12V, 1.26W, 0.9A) on each side.
* Since my little Arduino only outputs 5V max, I was planning to use 2
logic-level MOSFETs, one for each side: sound okay?
* All my lights are 12V and are powered directly off the flasher
unit (I guess this is for safety to keep from having power going to them in case they short out, are damaged, etc.), so my understanding is that I'll need a ""High Side"" FET configuration.  Someone told me the other day that this means I will need to drive the FET with more voltage than I can get from the Arduino, so will probably require a FET driver with an integrated pump.  I'm not sure how to 'size' or select these appropriately...any help here would be appreciated!
* I've been told I need to find an ""Automotive Quality"" FET because
the power supply on a motorcycle will be of generally poor quality.  
* I need a very wide operating temperature...any temp you might
imagine some riding a motorcycle in basically would be ideal.
* I need a MOSFET/Driver combo that will allow me to use Pulse Width
Modulation to dim it with the Arduino's 5V (perhaps this is 'any' FET,
I'm just learning this all so I'm not sure).  Basically I'm just
thinking I need something that I can saturate very quickly so I'm not
running the FET in linear mode?

Basically, I'm trying to figure out how to select the right MOSFET and
Driver combo for this job, but I'm a little confused around the high
side FET set-up and what that will mean for the type of driver/pump I
will need.

I'm an ME graduate - I had three 6-month (full-time) coops while in school in different industries, so I have more experience than your average recent grad (working and interviewing), but vacation time was never really a discussion because it was along the lines of a need-to-request basis.

I'm sure many of you are thinking ""why are you getting ahead of yourself - you don't even have a job yet and you want more time off?"" Yes. Yes I do. I am not lazy, and I realize this isn't the typical American golden-employee-viewpoint from an employer's side, but my free time is important to me and it makes me happy. Two weeks out of the year sounds typical for an entry level, and I'm sorry if I have a problem with having 4% of my working time off.

I want to know what you guys think of asking an employer if it's possible to get extra vaca in exchange for a salary reduction. (Alternatively, say if I just finished my first year, I asked for a vaca increase over a raise)

I'm from the work to live boat, as I hope an increasing number of us will be. But like I said I'm not lazy, and I'm aware of how carefully I would have to pitch something like this to avoid sounding so.

So employers, employees, what are your experiences with increased vacation? How would you feel if a rather competent and intelligent candidate pitched this to you?

Since I'm stubborn and really want to see the typical American ratio of work/vacation changed, I won't probably be dissuaded from trying this.

Intro: High school student, going to an engineering college with few basic pre-req courses complete. Studying Computer Engineering, hoping for a minor in Economics. 

Question: It is common knowledge that freshmen internships are hard to come by, and things don't start getting ""interesting"" until Junior year, when the pre-requisite course work applicable to the position is completed. What I would like to know is what should I do to prepare for the various tasks ahead for internship application. Are there any specific materials I should be going over in preparation for the various interviews? Starting a collection of any projects I'm working on when I go to college for presentation. I realize this varies greatly from job to job, but I'm not sure where to start. Anything that I should specifically work on that will help me from the get go? Any adjunct material I should cover on top of my coursework that will give me a clear advantage or distinguish me from other candidates. 

What I know to do or have done: 
- Visit the career webpage of my university
- Prepare and revise a resume 
- Create a LinkedIn Account 
- Got to the career services office often, and meet with an occupation counselor 
- Go to career fairs held at the university
- Visit prospective company internship pages and understand the requirements for each position
- As with above: watch any supplemental material for preparation for internships
- Maintain a 3.0 GPA. 

Prospective companies I've thought about (of course this list will change, I'm just giving my naive and inexperienced look into a very competitive field which is engineering internships): 
- Freescale
- Marvell Corp
- Micron
- Texas Instruments
- Qualcomm
- Intel
- Nvidia
- AMD
These are highly competitive fields, I don't expect to land a position without proper preparation. Obviously, this isn't all the companies with internships for Computer Engineering.

20,Microfluidics problem,1339603318,"So, my colleague and I have taken up an old project for our boss. In the process of getting it up an running again we have encountered a problem with the microfluidics chip. The main channel on the chip is clogged with solidified alginate.

For background, the alginate comes as a fluid initially and, upon leaving the microfluidics chip, enters a calcium solution which will cause it to polymerize and solidify. It appears that there was some leftover alginate in the chip from the last time the project was being worked on and it solidified in the channel.

In an attempt to dissolve the alginate we are using a 10mM solution of EDTA which breaks up the polymerized alginate. Our problem, however, is that we can't get the EDTA solution to make contact with the alginate. As we push the solution into the channel, the pressure builds up too high for the pumps to handle and they stop. 

We have considered heating up both the chip and the EDTA in hopes that it would cause the alginate to start to liquify, but we are dealing with $1500 custom chip and we are cautious to try anything risky.

26,Some questions regarding applying to entry-level engineering positions.,1339454278,"Sorry if this isn't the correct type of post for this subreddit or seems like a whiny ""life is too hard"" post, but here it goes.

Background:

I graduated school about a month ago from the University of Connecticut with a BS in mechanical engineering. During my last semester I was sure that I would be able to get a job in one of my ideal locations (baltimore, boston or philly) given some time. Because of this I used the schools career fair as more of a practice as 90% of the jobs were located in CT (which I had decided I did not want to live in). However, after 100+ emails and applications, I have very few leads. I have expanded my search to any seemingly interesting places for a few weeks now. I value my social life my social life greatly, and don't want to be stuck in the middle of nowhere living a miserable life.  I only seem to get feedback from manufacturing engineer positions. This is likely due to the fact that I have a good GPA (~3.3) but no internship experience. I also had limited CAD experience in school. Because of this I have being trying to teach it to myself. I feel that I have gained a basic understanding, but no company sees that as legitimate. I'm a blue collar manual labor worker at heart, so I'm considering applying to field engineering positions as well.


Questions:


1. If I venture away from mechanical jobs and go into manufacturing will I be able to transition back if I do not think it's for me?


2. My perception of field engineering that the job itself is interesting, however you are generally in boring locations and asked to travel to more boring locations often. Is this perception correct?


3. Given that I don't have internship and little CAD experience, how do I get companies to give me a chance in a mechanical field?


4. What are some interesting places within the US that I could apply.

28,"Control engineering - Interesting/illustrative educational examples for state feedback, LQR, Kalman filter",1339449812,"I'm working on a thesis that is to be sort of an educational material for state space approach, state feedback, LQR and state observer/Kalman filter. I've covered the theory already but now I'm struggling to find interesting and illustrative examples in which I could apply these aforementioned methods; one for each for instance. I'd like the example systems to be simple enough to be easily understood but the dilemma is that for the state space methods to be actually useful/superior in anyway the systems should be complex, say MIMO or plainly more state variables.

I'd really appreciate any tips and ideas!  (oh and also, I'm covering the examples in continuous-time)


Here are some ideas I already had in mind just to give some idea what kind of stuff I might be looking for:

In pole placement I'd like to turn an unstable, say integrating, system into a stable one via state feedback. No problem with that, but for anything else than a retard simple system it seems to be impossible choose the desired poles in a deterministic way (other than left half complex plane for continuous system), for example critical damping and whatnot. Right now I'm thinking about just forcing through with a simple conduction heat transfer system over three plates and one heating power input, plate temperatures being the state variables. Like this:

    u--&gt; T1 | T2 | T3

    Q=k*dT  (for example Q12=k*(T1 - T2) )

    k*dT1/dt= Qin - Q12
    k*dT2/dt= Q12 - Q23
    k*dT3/dt= Q23

Let me know if it's stupid!

In LQR I'd like to illustrate the determinism brought into the design of the state feedback gain, how for example weighting a velocity-like state variable is related to damping and weighting the input optimizes the control energy or something.

For Kalman filter I should at least illustrate the noise filtering features and the general robustness. I didn't think about the actual examples for this one yet.",AskEngineers,takeitandgooo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/uwsdk/control_engineering_interestingillustrative/

**How I got to where I’m at….**



So basically I'm graduating in a week with a BA in Psychology from UCSB. Over the past four years I’ve gone through almost all the pre-recs for econ, philosophy, psychology and a few over liberal arts majors. I couldn’t really get into any of them, and as a result I went back to psych because I enjoyed it the most of what I had tried. Unfortunately my interest has severely dwindled. I wasn’t challenged at all and I know for fact that I would not enjoy a career in psychology. So I recently began trying to figure out what it is exactly that I’d like to do for a career.  I realized in choosing my career path one of the most important things is being able to enjoy what some consider the day to day “mundane” tasks. I also took a look at myself at tried to figure out what questions I like asking about the world. The result of this introspection was the actualization that I enjoy asking HOW things work.  Along the same lines I saw within myself a project orientated person. To me it is such a satisfying feeling to see things come together from nothing into a functional object.





About a year ago I began taking the History of Architecture courses and was pretty fascinated by it. However, none of these courses really gave me an idea of what it would be like to be an architect. Currently I’m signed up for an Architectural design program at UCLA for the summer that will surely give me a clue of what the work is like but, I’m not a 100% sure this is the path I want to take. This same year, I also discovered another love besides architecture. A passion that I couldn’t at the time describe as engineering but my obsessions could speak for the themselves. It all started when I built my first PC. I couldn’t remember the last time I had been so into a project. I could hardly pull myself away from researching parts. I’d literally sit on my laptop for hours on end figuring out which components were the best and why it is they were the best. At the same time I developed an obsession with the projects on instructables.com. Specifically I was fascinated with the capabilities of arduino and for some reason I saw an inherent beauty in its capabilities. The long dormant creative hemisphere of my brain light up like a Christmas tree. I could somehow just see ways in which I could improve/create wonderful things given such a framework to operate within.





In light of such recent self-exploration I determined that engineering fit my personality quite well, specifically; computer hardware engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. I wished I had given myself a chance to explore these fields over the past four years but what’s done is done. While I believe I’m capable of succeeding in an Engineering program it is really hard to know without having taken any of the prerequisites. In high-school I excelled at science and math but at the collegiate level the only courses I took in those fields was a couple of calculus classes. The first two I neglected to take seriously and didn’t study for them at all. While the first one I managed alright in the second one I, for god knows what reason, thought I could skate by without going to any classes or practicing any problems. Well, the professor was in the business of weeding out these kinds of students and I ended up failing the course. I took it again and actually spent time practicing problems and getting help when I needed it. The result was one of the few academic challenges I experienced over the past four years. Not in the sense that I couldn’t comprehend the material but rather that I actually had to put in some work to get an A. I then took the second part of the applied calculus series and once again with some work managed an A fairly easily.





While I know an engineering program would be extremely difficult I’m at a point in which I am ready to take on an academic challenge. I’m ready to take school seriously and put in the effort that is required for me to pursue a career in a field that I love. Nonetheless, I am at a crossroad in life. While engineering and even perhaps architecture seem an appropriate fit, I don’t have the actual experience to back up the notion that I would like to pursue either. I believe the design program at UCLA will help me tremendously in deciding my feelings towards architecture. Like it or not though, I would like to give myself a chance to experience engineering so I can choose my career as wisely as possible. Unfortunately for me most engineering graduate programs require you to have a BS in engineering and dually unfortunate for me most undergraduate programs will not accept you if you already have an undergraduate degree like I do. This however does not deter me, I know it’s possible.





**I can’t however sit around and wait for it to all unfold. So I guess what I truly want to know from all you engineers is…**

6. What’s a good way to get an idea of what it is actually like to study engineering and what it’s like to be a working engineer? 
5. Would it be more beneficial to try and take prerequisite courses at a city college to see if I can keep up or should I try and pursue something like an arduino project, or maybe even try to shadow an engineer? 
4. Does anyone have any good books or video lectures that I can check it?
3. How did you guys know you wanted to do engineering?
2. Does anybody know of any masters programs that accept students from liberal arts backgrounds (obviously pending I take the prereqs at a CC)?

47,Entry level engineering jobs where one can learn a lot and maybe even be outdoors/on-site? (Civil/Environmental),1339259632,"Ill try and keep this short, and any insight would be really appreciated. Basically, I graduated in May from an Engineering school in Virginia with a Civil degree. I had a great GPA, a bunch of experience doing field engineering for development in the third world (Haiti) over the summers, and landed an internship with a city public utilities department (water/wastewater). The job is good, pays ok, and Im learning a good deal, but it will only last for a few months. Its also 90% an office job, and Ive quickly learned that being in an office 40-50 hours is not exactly my cup of tea.

Basically, I was wondering what suggestions people had for types of jobs/internships to look for that would teach me a lot and get me outdoors. Pay isnt too big of an issue, as long as I can eat and pay rent Im cool. I was considering trying to be a construction inspector or get on a survey crew, but Im not sure if these would assist me in looking for future engineering positions or be that educational.

Perhaps Im being too picky and I should just apply to anything I can and pray I get a callback. Maybe Im not even in the right field and every engineering job just lands you in an office for the rest of your life. I have no idea, this is all so new and a little overwhelming. Ive been constantly searching on the usual websites like Indeed and Monster and Craigslist, but nothing too interesting (or entry-level) has really come up. Like I said, any insight or advice would be very very welcome!

tl;dr: Recent graduate, looking for a position that wont have me in an office all day and will teach me about civil engineering more, any advice would be awesome

48,Got a Telephone Interview with Pratt and Whitney Canada - Any tips?,1339258756,"So I've just got an email from Pratt and Whitney Canada offering me a telephone interview (I'm in the UK) with some folks from Quebec. I'm elated, as working at somewhere like Pratt or any big gas turbine manufacturer is something of a dream come true for me, but there's a couple of issues:

1) This is my first interview. Ever. Besides a few mocks and some informal interviews for vocational work to pay the bills, I have not had any experience with interviews before. I have read all the standard tips that I can get from google, but I'd appreciate hearing from people what they think are the most important things to remember.

2) My resume has got to them through a roundabout process which originally started off as me networking with a few folks at United Technologies in the US. I know who I sent my Resume too, but after that I basically waited for a month and out of the blue get this awesome but mystifying email from P&amp;W C's HR dept. inviting me to interview for candidacy. They didn't tell me what the candidacy is for, however, so although I'm elated to have the chance to join their team, I've got no idea what the job role is. Not a problem for me because I'll take any opportunity I can to work with the industry leaders, but of course, I would like to tailor my interview responses to the task at hand, which is problematic if I don't know what that task is.

54,Need to electrically control rotation of small mirror,1339195055,"Hello,

I have a mechanical engineering / EE question, and where better to start than the wizards of Reddit?  I have already asked this of a few engineers at my place of work, but I'm not sure I believe their cost / power / size estimates, and as a software guy myself I'm unsure how to validate their claims.

I have a small mirror, perhaps 3-10mm diameter.  I need to be able to rotate it a few degrees back and forth.  (Picture a quarter spinning on the counter, or a pocketwatch spinning at the end of its fob.)  I don't have to turn it all the way 'round, just maybe 45 degrees tops.  (For the curious, I'm reflecting a laser along a short lateral scan.)

It doesn't have to move especially fast (10 degrees of arc per second of time would do me fine).  It doesn't have to abide by any critically tight tolerances for acceleration, although I would like to be able to hold it still at an angle of, let's say, 1 degree accuracy.

I'm running off disposable batteries, so I don't want much of a power draw, and I'm handheld, so I don't want much size or weight impact.  Heat is a bit of an issue within an enclosed housing, but I've got a TEC to cool the important parts.  Obviously I'd want to minimize vibration (wasted efficiency), but I don't really care about sound, for instance.  We're already spinning PLC boards (PIC etc) so could control it at what ever voltages and signaling levels required.

It really sounds like a pretty cheap little subsystem to me.  If it's based on a little motor, I assume we could simply gear it to the prescribed angular field of regard.  If the motor is one-way, I assume we could invert direction just by sliding an extra gear into the mix.  It *sounds* easy...but as an engineer of sorts myself, I know how devlishly insidious those words can be.

But I'm told it ""may be tricky"", and ""could get quite expensive.""

**How I got to where I’m at….**
     So basically I'm graduating in a week with a BA in Psychology from UCSB. Over the past four years I’ve gone through almost all the pre-recs for econ, philosophy, psychology and a few over liberal arts majors. I couldn’t really get into any of them, and as a result I went back to psych because I enjoyed it the most of what I had tried. Unfortunately my interest has severely dwindled. I wasn’t challenged at all and I know for fact that I would not enjoy a career in psychology. So I recently began trying to figure out what it is exactly that I’d like to do for a career.  I realized in choosing my career path one of the most important things is being able to enjoy what some consider the day to day “mundane” tasks. I also took a look at myself at tried to figure out what questions I like asking about the world. The result of this introspection was the actualization that I enjoy asking HOW things work.  Along the same lines I saw within myself a project orientated person. To me it is such a satisfying feeling to see things come together from nothing into a functional object. 

     About a year ago I began taking the History of Architecture courses and was pretty fascinated by it. However, none of these courses really gave me an idea of what it would be like to be an architect. Currently I’m signed up for an Architectural design program at UCLA for the summer that will surely give me a clue of what the work is like but, I’m not a 100% sure this is the path I want to take. This same year, I also discovered another love besides architecture. A passion that I couldn’t at the time describe as engineering but my obsessions could speak for the themselves. It all started when I built my first PC. I couldn’t remember the last time I had been so into a project. I could hardly pull myself away from researching parts. I’d literally sit on my laptop for hours on end figuring out which components were the best and why it is they were the best. At the same time I developed an obsession with the projects on instructables.com. Specifically I was fascinated with the capabilities of arduino and for some reason I saw an inherent beauty in its capabilities. The long dormant creative hemisphere of my brain light up like a Christmas tree. I could somehow just see ways in which I could improve/create wonderful things given such a framework to operate within. 

     In light of such recent self-exploration I determined that engineering fit my personality quite well, specifically; computer hardware engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. I wished I had given myself a chance to explore these fields over the past four years but what’s done is done. While I believe I’m capable of succeeding in an Engineering program it is really hard to know without having taken any of the prerequisites. In high-school I excelled at science and math but at the collegiate level the only courses I took in those fields was a couple of calculus classes. The first two I neglected to take seriously and didn’t study for them at all. While the first one I managed alright in the second one I, for god knows what reason, thought I could skate by without going to any classes or practicing any problems. Well, the professor was in the business of weeding out these kinds of students and I ended up failing the course. I took it again and actually spent time practicing problems and getting help when I needed it. The result was one of the few academic challenges I experienced over the past four years. Not in the sense that I couldn’t comprehend the material but rather that I actually had to put in some work to get an A. I then took the second part of the applied calculus series and once again with some work managed an A fairly easily. 

     While I know an engineering program would be extremely difficult I’m at a point in which I am ready to take on an academic challenge. I’m ready to take school seriously and put in the effort that is required for me to pursue a career in a field that I love. Nonetheless, I am at a crossroad in life. While engineering and even perhaps architecture seem an appropriate fit, I don’t have the actual experience to back up the notion that I would like to pursue either. I believe the design program at UCLA will help me tremendously in deciding my feelings towards architecture. Like it or not though, I would like to give myself a chance to experience engineering so I can choose my career as wisely as possible. Unfortunately for me most engineering graduate programs require you to have a BS in engineering and dually unfortunate for me most undergraduate programs will not accept you if you already have an undergraduate degree like I do. This however does not deter me, I know it’s possible.

     I can’t however sit around and wait for it to all unfold. So I guess what I truly want to know from all you engineers is…
* What’s a good way to get an idea of what it is actually like to study engineering and what it’s like to be a working engineer? 
* Would it be more beneficial to try and take prerequisite courses at a city college to see if I can keep up or should I try and pursue something like an arduino project, or maybe even try to shadow an engineer? 
* Does anyone have any good books or video lectures that I can check it?
* How did you guys know you wanted to do engineering?
* Does anybody know of any masters programs that accept students from liberal arts backgrounds (obviously pending I take the prereqs at a CC)?
* Any general life/academic advice?",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/uqdyi/is_it_worth_it_for_me_to_give_engineering_a_shot/

66,"I have LQR Optimized Coefficients, how to get the parameters that would give those coefficients  (sort of like a LQR inverse)?",1339092610,"Hello /r/askengineers,

This is a controls related issue that I'm having right now. For part of a school project, I'm trying to [balance an inverted pendulum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV-GhmX3ris).

So we got some coefficients from a past lab report, however every time we attempt to get the state-space coefficients through LQR optimization, we get state-space control values that are just way off and not resulting in stability.

As we can't take apart the apparatus, we thought we should be able to get the parameters that went into the LQR optimization from working coefficients.  The problem is that I have no clue how to go about this (I don't know much about LQR optimization as it is, as I am just an undergrad student), so I thought I would ask people here if they have a clue where to begin going about this.

Thanks in advance for any input!

**EDIT**
To the people accusing me of cheating, your view must be obscured by the clouds when you're up there so high on your horse. 

LQR is not something taught to undergrads. None of us, undergrads, have anything resembling the knowledge needed to perform a ""LQR inverse"".  Hell, most undergrads in mechanical engineering, even at my school which is control theory heavy, doesn't even know what LQR is.  

Our TA gave us a down and dirty run down of how LQR optimization in MatLab works in terms of what you enter as an input (how to input the general transfer function, and the parameters of the system), and that's the extent of what we are ""taught"" about LQR. 

The whole idea of a LQR inverse is something we came up with as we **were given** K parameters that *worked in the past* by our TA.  Given that the parameters is also something we were given by our TA (which resulted in non-stable systems), that meant either we are implementing LQR wrong (which our TA didn't think was the issue), or we were given bad parameters.  The only way to evaluate this?  See what parameters a ""LQR inverse"" spits out and use them to compare to the other given parameters.  Something is wrong, and none of us in the lab have any clue what it is.

Seriously guys, I want to know how many undergrads are expected to have such a strong knowledge of LQR to the point that they would be able to develop a LQR inverse like function, where did you guys go to school?

I'm looking for a formula to calculate the heat that is emitted in the center of the mesh of a MFLB. For those of you who don't know what this is, here a link to the [MFLB](http://magic-flight.com/) website.  
I imagine something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/qP3fR.jpg).  

So relevant would be: 

* material and diameter of the rod  
* material and size of the mesh 
* contact length of the rod on the mesh 

Assuming that the rod is firmly pressed against the mesh.  
Voltage supply (?) is a short-circuited NiMH battery.

First year was pretty hard but I did well (A-/B+ average) but I only had 5 courses at a time - to graduate on time I need to take 6 at a time for the rest of my degree.

My original plan was to drop 1 course each semester and then take an extra semester to do courses (and probably spend one of my work terms doing courses as well, I have 6 work terms and only need to work for 4 of them).

I'm having second thoughts though and would like some advice. Will employers look at my resume, see that I took an extra year/half-year to graduate and be less likely to hire me? Or do they base their decision mostly off of work experience from co-ops?

My reasons for wanting to extend my time at university are to have a bit of free time so I can still enjoy myself (last semester was pretty brutal) and get a higher GPA. I've spoken to several 4th year students who said they're taking an extra year to grad and that doing 6 courses made their GPAs drop by a couple points.

I'm hacking together an exhaust system for a server room.  [It looks like this.](http://imgur.com/MEeFy).

I've got two 24' fans from Home Depot -- on high, they can push 4,000 CFM each.  I'm in the process of building a box you can see in that diagram.

On the pictured side of the box, I'll be plugging in exhaust vents from some portable air conditioners.  On the other side, I'll be running a bunch of 4' ducts down to the back of the servers; each server's PSU/exhaust gets its own duct.

I'd like to equalize pressure as best I can.  I presume ports closest to the fan will have the biggest pressure differential, and thus, suck the hardest?

What are my options?  The layout of the room prevents me from normalizing the duct length and distance from fans so that all ports are essentially equal.

I'm thinking, with that sort of box build (i.e. long rectangle), the only thing I can really do is alter hole size -- smaller holes near the fans in order to limit the amount of air that can be sucked through them... which should hopefully be compensated by the bigger holes towards the back.

Also, I have no clue how many ports x size would be necessary in order to provide enough air flow for the fans to push 8,000 CFM combined.

[Sketch](http://i.imgur.com/OPIVO.png)

Fairly simple question. I'm looking for the distance from two cameras to an object from just analyzing their pictures and the distance between the two cameras.

Parameters:

* Object can be anywhere within both fields of view (triangle created could be acute or obtuse)
* Cameras are parallel to each other
* Cameras are at a fixed, known distance from each other
* Pictures will be taken at the same time

I've read about photogrammetry, but mostly it's to calculate / estimate relative distances. So, top of a mountain to the bottom of a valley. Not distance from the ground to the plane taking the picture. (Not that my setup will be on a plane).

I can't seem to wrap my head around the math. Maybe I'm taking the wrong approach. So far my approach has been to take Picture 1, measure the distance from centre of the picture to a point on the object. From there I'll get an offset distance. I can use that to get Angle 1 as shown. Then repeat to get Angle 2. Once I have the Angles, I can just use a bit of trig to figure out the Distance. But my problem is that I can't calculate what the Angles are.

I don't have any other related engr. work experience (interships/co-ops, etc.) other than a QA position at my dads company years ago and my gpa is mediocre (2.7 due to being shitty at circuits but made deans list a bunch of times), however I have a pretty nice resume with an impressive list of projects (some of which got high honors/awards). I have sent out my resume and cover letter to roughly 30 or so different companies and have only gotten 3 interviews out of it. 1 of them was for a manufacturing position which I never heard back from (im an ME), one was from a huge corp. which is flying me out for an final onsite interview next week (I did a few phone interviews with them already), and the third was for an internship that I had originally thought was paid (craigslist post just said: Internship, negotiable based on experience) however it turns out it is unpaid.

I had my final interview for the internship today with the CEO of the company who informed me it is an unpaid internship but it will turn into a full time job. He told me the internships there are like a long interview and usually it is 3 months, but for me they will hire me after two months, though I dont know if he tells this to everyone or really likes me lol. Now the company is a real small company with only like 4 engineers on staff where the team does literally everything up to manufacturing (theory, design, prototyping, testing, they got a full warehouse and machine shop but no technicians so the engineers build the prototypes themselves) so I would get a lot of cool hands on experience and it seems like a perfect fit for me. He offered me the job and asked me to start on Monday which I agreed too, but now I am kind of regretting it because I need to pay rent and shit, so what do I do?

I am hoping that I will get a full time offer from the big corporation after my on-site interview next week, but would rather have the job at the small company. Do you guys think I would be able to ask the place I am interning for to counter the offer (assuming I get one) if they want me to stay there? This is why I am thinking I should do the unpaid internship because by the time I would get an offer I'd have been working there at least a week or two so they will see that I am a good worker and honestly I would rather stay in my city than have to move halfway across the country to a place I never want to live. However i have also heard others on here blast un-paid internships as scams and even say they are illegal. So I really don't know. On one hand I take it and it's a good prospect, on the other I don't and I am back to square one of uncertainty and the sick feeling of 'im never gonna get hired by anyone, im gonna end up homeless, etc...""

I was able to get 2 weeks off this year after lots of begging and brown nosing.

24,"Considering switching to EE, but I hesitant.",1338526311,"So I am a math major that just finished up my first year in college. I ended up declaring math and the only courses that I have taken are calculus 1 and 2. I definitely enjoy math but I have concerns about future job prospects, and when I look at the course sequences for other majors it seems like they get to take what seem to be really interesting classes (for instance circuits/electronics classes as EE), while math is just the typical analysis, abstract algebra, etc. I am sure they are fun and interesting but something about it seems unsatisfying in comparison, I am unsure of how to describe it. Then there is also the point that I haven't reached 'true' proof based math yet, and from what I have heard it is a entirely different game than calculus, but I feel that I would find it interesting. 

After some thinking I put together that I seem to greatly enjoy (in the order of most enjoyment) problem solving, mathematics, learning about technology (read electronics as phones, tablets, computers, the keyboard I am typing on, etc), and physics (which I seem to have some trouble in, but that isn't a big deal. I can always just work harder). The majors which I feel that I should consider based on these interests are math, computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering. I have ruled out computer science because I did a lot of programming as a hobby in high school and kind of burned myself/grew out of it. I really don't want the focal point of my job to be programming, and I also feel that that would crop up quite a bit in computer engineering and in most jobs I would get with a math degree (it seems that most go into a programming related field). That leaves electrical engineering and math. I have already expressed my concerns about math, and it seems like EE would help alleviate my want for more than just math.

The only concern I really have about EE is that I have only taken one physics course over kinematics which I ended up with a B in and had a good deal of trouble understanding certain concepts, but its probably not as big of a deal (I can always take the time to review the concepts and just try harder overall) as I am thinking. Does electricity based physics rely heavily on topics in kinematics? 

Other than that I really can't think of any real reasons not to switch to EE, but for some reason I am hesitant.

25,"Is there a series of books (different series per subject is ok of course) I can buy that teach every subject of math, physics, electrical engineering, electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer engineering in the following way listed inside?",1338523440,"It's hard for me to learn something unless I can make connections and paint pictures in my head and stuff. For example, this is my second stab at Trigonometry and it's a little hard to remember all of the formulas for the trig functions (product-to-sum, half angle identities, double angle identities, etc) and some other things. I have a feeling I will run into much greater trouble with calculus and more advanced mathematics. The hardest part is figuring out why I need all of these billions of different ways of basically solving triangles and circles with all of those trig function formulas.

Is there a series of books at least for mathematics that teaches every math subject from Algebra to Geometry to Trig, Calculus, Differentials, Linear Algebra, all the way through to the rest of the mathematics subjects in which it teaches the history of how each formula was discovered, the proofs, how it was derived, why it's needed, what it's used for in terms of solving real world (engineering/business/physics/chemistry/etc) problems I guess, pictures, etc? I was browsing around Barnes &amp; Nobles the other day trying to find some books like that, and I think I found a few, but I'm not sure if I should just fork over the 20-30 bucks each for them. I also heard that Advanced Mathematics for Engineering was good and that there was an edition called Advanced Physics for Engineering, but I don't know if they're good at teaching the way how I learn. 

I've seen some books on electrical engineering or general electronics, and I don't want to just see 2D pen drawings of circuit board diagrams, I want to know what all of those squiggly lines, breaks, circles, and other crap actually look like in reality. I want to see a real representation of every kind of circuit and stuff that it's showing me so I can paint real pictures in my head while I'm learning these formulas. Same with Computer Engineering and stuff if there are such books.

My major is engineering and I want to study computer engineering, electrical, electronic, chemical, mechanical, and bio engineering over the entire course of my life. I'd like to have some books that I could use to be able to teach myself everything in depth and use as references to supplement the classes I'll be taking and the college textbooks I'll be using for those classes.

These are books that I want to have indepth information for at least the subjects I listed in the title, not something that just talks about everything but is shallow in all of it, but I don't want it to be just text with formulas, I need to be able to see the formulas with pictures and proofs and at least a brief history so I can totally wrap my head around everything.


Also I was wondering if you guys happen to take notes digitally these days. I was thinking how awesome it would be to use some kind of portable tablet with a stylus with which I can use to take thousands of pages of notes by free-hand, maybe with some line/shape making tools like on the Windows Paint program, without wasting ink or paper or tons of backpack space, and be able to read ebooks/kindle books/etc. Maybe an iPad, or something better/cheaper? A large (8, 16gb, etc) built in HDD or compatibility with some kind of SD cards is a must. I also saw the HTC Flyer, 100 dollar Wacom Bamboo tablets, etc. I don't need it for surfing the web or anything fancy, just to be able to take good quality digital handwritten notes and stuff, possibly record audio at the same time so I can hear what my professor was saying that I missed while I was busy writing stuff down.

Also maybe a huge series of videos that covers these subjects (different series for every subject is ok too) and shows the experiments being done in real-time would be cool too.

30,How much Digital Information is actually on a CD? (x-post from r/askScience),1338513719,"Figured I might get some more interest and answers here -

Okay some background..... I was reading a thread ab mindblowing concepts on r/AskReddit, and became interested when someone asked about how CDs work, and was amazed by how much digital information could be stored on a disc through laser etching. So I did some further research and came up with this hypothesis (originally to correct someone, then to satisfy my own curiosity):

**assuming a 16bit bit-depth rate, a 44.1 kHz sampling rate, and a 74 minute playlength

standard CDs are encoded to play 44,100 samples of audio information in one second. Each sample contains 32 bits of information (stereo track - 2 channels, each with a 16bit binary code).

There are 6 samples in one frame, and 98 frames in a sector. Each sector has a time duration of (1/75) seconds.
This means the CD player processes 1,411,200 bits of digital audio information in one second. Since the standard CD plays 74 minutes long, this allows for a maximum amount of 6.2657 billion binary digits of audio information to be encoded on a CD. I believe this converts to 783.2 million bytes, which corresponds (roughly) to 747 MB~740 MB.

HOWEVER, the CD data also contains error-detection and error-correction/compensation code and control/display subcode embedded with the raw audio data.

A frame is constructed of 6 audio samples, 8 bytes of CIRS code, and 1 byte of control/display subcode. This means each frame is 33 bytes (264 bits) initially.

However, each 8bit byte of the 33 byte frame is converted to a corresponding 14bit EFM ""word"". These ""words"" are then parsed together with 3bit ""connectors"" (satisfying the EFM rules).

When joining frames together in a sector, a unique 27bit synchronization word is used, bringing each frame to a total of 588 bits of raw digital information.

Since each sector is made up of 98 frames, a sector is calculated to be 57,624 bits.

Which means that every second, the optical-reader in a CD player processes 4.322 million digits of binary information. A 74 minute CD would contain 19.2 billion digits of raw binary information. 19.2 billion bits = 2.4 billion bytes, or ~2,300 Mb

To anyone familiar with laser discs, does this sound correct? Please let me know if you have questions about my math or process, and any corrections.",AskEngineers,willywompa,/r/AskEngineers/comments/uev3m/how_much_digital_information_is_actually_on_a_cd/

32,Cascade PID Tuning help,1338496392,"[**Diagram**](http://i.imgur.com/2fC2g.png)

**Background:**

1.5"" Pipe, sch40 catalyst reactor. Being heated by heat cable in ranges of 200-500C.

**Issue:**

The lag between the heat cable and the thermocouple reading in the middle of the catalyst reactor is too large for traditional single loop PID tuning to operate effectively.

**Solution Attempts:**

Upon researching the topic, it appears as though a cascade control loop is the best suited option for this application. Additional thermocouples were added to the shell of the reactor. This provides a faster acting response to the PID loop, allowing for a controlled response. 

For those who haven't heard of a cascade loop, an inner (slave) loop is controlling the faster acting response. In this application it's the thermocouple making contact with the heat cable. 

This loop has been tuned and will stabilize relatively quickly. 

I have a smaller reactor of 1"" tube that I can control using a cascade. It has less thermal mass so the heat up time is more responsive, making it easier to control.

**Current Issue:**
On the larger reactor there is too much thermal mass for the cascade control to ever stabalize. Here is my tuning parameters.

*Inner loop:*

PV: Thermocouple measurement from the shell of the reactor (C)

SP: Setpoint of main loop + Offset setpoint defined by outer loop (C)

Output: % of heat cable output

Proportional only control (I and D terms don't work when the setpoint changes in my software) Most of the references suggest P control is enough since the I and D terms are being handled by the outer loop

P=4

[Response with I and D working](http://i.imgur.com/v7fr6.png)

*Outer Loop:*

PV: Thermocouple reading from center of reactor (C)

SP: Temperature desired

Output: Offset temperature for inner loop


It just oscillates about 20 degrees surrounding the setpoint. I've tried multiple P, I, and D terms and nothing seems to be making a significant impact.

I initially had a output range of -100 to 100, but that seemed to fluctuate. I lowered it to -50 and 50 but that still didn't do the trick. 

First attempt:

P: 6

I: 0.5

D=2

Current:

P: 3

I: .5

D: 0.1

I need to replace the breaker on the right with one large enough to run two 30 amp RV outlets and if possible it would be ideal to go a little higher and be able to have an set of outlets as well, so up to 100 amp would be perfect.   

I have no clue how to determine that though, every other box I've looked at had some sort of master breaker that made it easy to tell but  these seem to be directly wired to the meter with nothing in between.

In addition, I need to run the wiring somewhere between 60 to 100 feet from the box, what sort of electrical cable would I want to use for that application?

I have a couple of questions:

1) How does the job field look for the RTP area? I'm not picky with what types of jobs I qualify for. The only reason why I'm asking about this area is because I have family there that I'd like to be closer to. Also, in the future, I'd like to get an MBA from UNC, so getting instate tuition would be ideal.

2) I'm not graduating until December, but I figured I'd start looking now. Any advice on where to look, or which companies to look at? I already look on my school's career board and LinkedIn, but I just want to make sure I have everything covered.

Like I said, I just recently started (only 2 weeks under my belt) and I currently don't have many responsibilities aside from a few weekly reports. I'm still learning a lot about the company's practices and how my department works, so it's tough for me to judge what I will be doing as I go deeper into this internship - which makes it tough to come up with good business goals.

Honestly my main goal for the summer is to learn. I don't feel that I  particularly know a lot about cars, my company, or Vehicle Quality. I want to learn a lot more about all of them over the summer,  but that does not sound like a business goal.

It does not have to be military grade, or anything of the sort, and even launching a projectile 10 feet would be great.  However, I am having a ton of trouble getting enough current to go through the rails and the projectile. 

I tried using a few (4) capacitors (rated at 2200 micro farads and 63 volts) in parallel, charged with four 15-volt batteries in series, but the current was not enough to get my projectile to move (it is about .004kg) and only managed to significantly heat it up. The only reasoning I can think of for there not being enough current to produce a meaningful force would be that there is a ton of resistance in the setup.

My question is if there is a way to increase the current significantly in order to get some movement without having to get more batteries (and capacitors rated for higher voltage capacities)?

1. My main question is how I should hook up the old steam radiator, it has 4 openings.  I want to know which should be cold and which should be hot?

My gut says, if you supply the input (cold) with more the output (hot) will take care of itself.  But my limited science knowledge tells me, ""the hot will expand"" maybe the hot output should be more? 

I could also have the hot and cold BOTH be 1.5"" by crazy tilting the radiator and strapping it on, but the flow inside the radiator would be pretty odd and the output would not be the highest point of the radiator.


2. I haven't bought the pipes yet, should I size the system to the smallest opening (1.125""), and save a little money, or just run everything 1.5"" because one smaller choke point doesn't matter?


3. The pipes running off the hot tub are PVC, and I was planning on using galvanized steel, inside the sauna, does anyone have any experience joining these materials?


4. Anyone know any fluid dynamic formulas to predict if this thing will work?  

If it probably will not, I might just plumb the pump in without the valves, actually never mind I should have the courage of my convictions, and plumb it with no pump option, and if it doesn't work, PVC is pretty easy to cut into and install the pump.",AskEngineers,2_old_2B_clever,/r/AskEngineers/comments/u90y7/practical_fluid_dynamics_question_im_trying_to/

So the two main issues that I have Identified will be to do with the fill material (liminite) and the site of construction.

For Limonite- Look at the shear strength (van shear testing and tri-axial for parameters), compressibility (standard compaction test, 1D odometer for consolidation ) and permeability (falling head test).  In-situ testing for natural moisture content.  An Atterburg limit test should also be used to find the PL, LL, SL. High Plasticity Silt. Would limonisation/laterisation be a problem and would groundcover be sufficient to stop the process?

For Site- Testing (CPT and Geophysical) should be used to determine if the foundations/abutments have suitable shear strength and no to very low levels of compressive material.  Excavation of compressible, low strength or high hydraulic conductive materials should be undertaken. Grouting of high hydraulic materials is also an option.  

Can anyone think of any other issues to take into account?
Or any other aspect I might of overlooked?",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/u74ma/recompacted_limonite_tsf_question/

87,The Lawnmower Mystery,1338095163,"I brushed my neighbor's chain link fence while I was mowing, and received what I believe was an electric shock.  I've been shocked by wall current before, as well as a running engine, and it felt similar to wall current, although I don't think this metric is particularly valid.  My hand jumped against my chest, and the lawnmower sputtered and died. The safety handle is fastened securely with a clamp, so my grip had nothing to do with the lawnmower dying. 

 I then touched the fence with the back of my hand, touched the lawnmower, touched the lawnmower and fence at the same time, started the lawnmower, and touched both the fence and the lawnmower at the same time. None of these actions caused a shock. 

How did this happen? I'm not really worried about my safety, but as an engineering student, it bothers me that I cannot find a hypothesis to explain this event. I've made 4:

1. My neigbor weaves an extenton chord through the fence, to power her fountain. Perhaps the insulation has worn, electrifying the fence.  This seems unrasonable to me.  The fence is metal, on metal posts stuck into the ground, fastened togeather with metal bolts.  I think this is a ground, and the shortest path for the current to ground has nothing to do with me. I cannot see if the fountain is running or not. 

2. The ignition system of the lawnmower was involved. I dislike this hypotosis because the entire lawnmower acts as a ground for the magneto, it's all metal. [This](http://www.smallenginesrepairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tecumseh-cdi.jpg) explains. I know this is  the type of system the mower has. If the  high voltage  was ""leaking"" it shouln't have gone through the handle, me, and the fence; it would take the shortest path to the engine block.   The lawnmower is an old snapper, carefully maintained,  similar to [this](http://auction.repocast.com/details.cfm?ID=825301#photos), with electric start. 
The battery is missing, and the ends of the battery cables are covered with electrical tape; but I don't' see how this is relevant; the're two  different circuits (the battery is charged by another coil, the same magnet, and a rectifier), and even if some bizarre wiring problem pumped high voltage through the starting system, the engine block is the ground, not the fence. 

3. Static electricity created a potential difference between the lawnmower and fence. Despite Engineering Physics 2; I really don't know if this is a practical explanation. There's a lot of moving parts, could something set up a vandegraff-like condition? I think the wet grass would keep the lawnmower pretty well grounded, but I could be wrong.

4. I am mistaken about getting shocked. I reject this because the lawnmower started dying exactly while I perceived the shock, suggesting this was a physical, and not a mental phenomenon.

Thanks for reading this far, anyway.  Any thoughts are appreciated. 

tl;dr  I touched my lawnmower and a fence at the same time, why did I get shocked?

88,NEMA 6 Adapter,1338087012,"Hi, I need a little help with wall socket adapters. According to Wikipedia, I have a NEMA 6-15 wall socket. Next to it, I have an air conditioner  that has a NEMA 5 plug. The closest NEMA 5 socket I have requires an extension cord to reach. Though I'd have to buy a cord either way, I'd prefer to plug the AC into the closer socket for a cleaner look.

89,How would I determine the amount of ice needed to cool my home?,1338071761,"Note: Originally posted to /r/askscience 
  
I've had a plan to replicate [Stanford's ice plant](http://lbre.stanford.edu/sem/ice) but on a much smaller scale.  I did some uncontrolled experiments from the year prior where I froze a 50 gallon ice chest and that was a partial success.

I've already figured out a design for my distribution system and made some proof of concept tests to convert a chest freezer into a ice-reservoir, now I just need advice on the science involved.


My math:
1 gallon ~= 10 lbs 

1 tonne = ~3,306

3306 / 10 = 330 gallons for reservoir.

900 sqft above ground / 700 sqft below

Target is to chill the interior 10-15 degree's below ambient ( 95-105 farenheit ) for 8-10 hours.


My biggest fear is that I've completely missed the mark with understanding BTU's and that I'd need 1 tonne of ice for every hour of cooling.  The ideal is to avoid having to run a chiller during high load times when it's the most inefficient or running a swamp cooler constantly ( water is becoming scarce in my region ).  Additionally I was going to bury the 300-400 gallon reservoir into the ground as a natural insulator.

I have found a 3hz to 50kHz microphone, and I intend on applying a lowpass filter to it, but it is an omnidirectional microphone, it is also very sensitive.

That said, my directional idea was this. The mic is 6.5"" long and 0.86"" in diameter, so I would build a long rectangular box that is about 18"" and 5"" wide/deep, and line the interior with 2"" sound dampening foam, either wedge or pyramid, or both. The back of the box will have 2"" of foam as well, with the XLR cord winding through it. The microphone will be held up by silicone antivibration mounts and some lexan or plexiglass.  

I would mount the box on a tripod, and do sweeps trying to find the location of the sound. Also, it will be connected to a spectrum analyzer (DC to 250kHz). 

Will my idea work?

93,Steel welding - simple tools and techniques,1338011924,"(hopefully this is the right subreddit)

A little background before I ask the questions:

I grew up in the Eastern Bloc. While in school there, I learned steel welding. Can't tell you too much theory about it, except the welding machine was a heavy box with a transformer in it, that was growling loudly when in use. The electrodes were thin rods of metal covered with something that looked like solid ash. We would hook up the piece to the transformer with one fat cable, then proceed to welding with the electrode held in giant pliers.

I practiced quite a bit and I think I got pretty good at it. But that was then.

---

Nowadays I want to make structures like this:

http://www.webstertelescopes.com/atm_mirror_cell.htm

It's a primary mirror cell for a telescope. The mirror is sitting on those triangles on a wiffle tree structure. A mirror can be as big as the wheels on a car, and as heavy as a couple buckets of water, or more.

The requirements for the cell are: stiffness, lack of weight, corrosion resistance. The parts that are welded (the ends of those bars) look much simpler than what I used to do as a kid. It's made of stainless steel.

The problem is, I don't know anything about modern welding tools and techniques. All I'm familiar with is communist technology from the '80s.

What do I do? Do I just go to a home improvement store and buy an electric welder? I saw some today, they were a few hundred dollars and looked HUGE. I don't remember the welder being so big, and I thought devices get smaller as technology improves.

So what are the guidelines here? What kind of device should I be looking for?

What kind of electrodes?

How do I choose the filter density for the mask?

If I want to weld smaller or thinner parts (for different components in the telescope) what do I do? Do I just reduce the current?

95,Do hose clamps have a high tensile strength?,1338009792,"So, slightly complex backstory. [This is what I mean by hose clamp](http://www.amazon.com/Steelex-D3604-9-Inch-Strap-Clamp/dp/B001UE7JOK/ref=pd_cp_hi_1).

Explanation: I'm building a motorized lift from scratch using an [electric hoist](http://www.amazon.com/Grizzly-H0778-Electric-Hoist-110V/dp/B0000DD1IZ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338008786&amp;sr=8-3) as the power source. Due to cost limitations and the transient nature of the application (it's for a stage effect in a theater production that will only run two nights), the lift is partly of lumber construction and partly of steel. The part that concerns me at the moment, with the question in the post title, is this: The hoist is connected to a welded structure that it raises off the ground. The point it's connected to, above, is a steel pipe. The pipe is supported by a lumber structure. Directly speaking, the 1.5"" pipe sits in two holes cut through two 2x12"" vertical boards.

[Here's a simplified drawing](http://i.imgur.com/77w2i.jpg)

Basically I'm afraid that with any real weight on the lift, the pipe would split the wood and drop downward, so I want to clamp the wood to itself using something like a hose clamp, but then I started thinking, they might be too weak to hold something like that together. Is there a better way to do this?

The amount of weight I'm talking about will never exceed ~300lbs. Could even be closer to 250 or 200.

Things that are not in the drawing are the hoist cable/pulley, the welded structure being lifted, the tracks that will be fastened to the 2x12's that the welded structure will roll along vertically, the angular bracing for the 2x12's, etc ...

**tl;dr** - Weight on steel pipe going through holes in 2x12's may theoretically split the 2x12's as shown in [this drawing](http://i.imgur.com/77w2i.jpg)..
