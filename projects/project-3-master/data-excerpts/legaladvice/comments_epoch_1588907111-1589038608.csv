2,Neighbors Making My Life a Living Hell.. How do I deal with this.,1589038470,"Short story: Neighbor from hell making my living atrocious for pass year/two. And I have no ideas on how to through living like this. Please help...

Pre-quarantine: A year ago every single day, the neighbor next door would knock on the door so damn loud that neighbors from the other side of the building would be able to hear it. You would think why I would be complaining about knocking but they actually knock for at least 30 minutes for the other person to open and it’s at 5AM in the morning, EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I’m not even exaggerating. The neighbor thst was living next to them yelled at the person knocking that he would break his door if he doesn’t stop. You think he would stop but nah. It just kept omg going on. And I’m pretty sure they drove that person away because I see a different person coming in and out of there now. Then for about a good 6-8 months after the other neighbor left, they occasionally blasting music late at night usually 12AM till the brick of dawn. And almost every weekend they allow their kids stay up all night running around stomping. I’ve contacted 311 countless dozen of times and all they said is that they filled out a noise complaint to the police and they will investigate during their off duty hours. (Or something along the lines of that).


Quarantine: They’ve got a pet dog. It’s not bad that they have a dog, I’m not complaining about that they got a dog. But I am complaining about his their dog ACTUALLY BARK FOR LITERAL HOURS AND THEY WON’T EVEN STOP AND CONTROL HIM/HER. Any time of the day, you name it the dog provides it, they won’t care. When the dog stops barking, it’s their cue to start blasting their music. 

I’ve texted one neighbor from the other side of the building if they could provide me some info to tone it down. He replied with 311 or housing management number. Otherwise, wear ear plugs. Apparently they have been letting their dog pee on their side of the building.

3,My friends parents are gaslighting her and had her commited,1589038468,"I have an adult friend (21+) I have known for a few years. After confronting her parents over childhood abuse they had her committed. Her parents are very controlling and had her leave San Francisco County and stay at their house in San Jose. 

Her parents co own her condo in SF and have keys to her place, so they came over and convinced her to leave SF and go to SJ. Upon arriving in SJ they said she needed to take a bunch of meds and they called to get a prescription from her psych. The prescribed some sort of relaxing pill , and she told her doctor she does not consent to taking this. 

So after a day at her parents house she told them she wants to go home to SF and they said no. During a car ride she asked for them to let her out of the car and they restrained her and said she couldn’t leave 

Upon the end of the car ride she gets back to her parents house and eats a meal prepared by her parents. She falls asleep and wakes up a few hours later. 

When she wakes up she again asks to leave their house in SJ. They say no. She says I want to go to the hospital , they said no. So she decides to tell them she’s feeling suicidal and if they don’t take her to the hospital she will kill herself. She said she wrote a suicide note. She says this was a lie and no note was ever written 

So they called the police and the cops came. My friend is adamant she started to comply. The police asked her if she was ok and she said I want to go to the hospital to escape my parents. Then the police said ok are you ready to go and she said yes. So the officer said , What drugs have you taken if any? Friend says no, and then her mom chimes in “ she took an anti psychotic”. My friend told the police she never took that and told the officer she expressly didn’t consent and she asked the officer “is that legal? Can she drug me”

The cop said it’s legal if it’s prescribed. At this point she still thought this was a joke being played on her by her parents. 

So then she was admitted to the hospital, and eventually they wrote that they found a suicide note. She was kept at the hospital for 7 days for paranoia and delusions. During the stay she kept saying I wasn’t suicidal but her families input said she is delusional. 

After she is released she goes home to her apartment which her parents and her own. 

At this point her parents have said they will randomly come and do home checks on her, without her consent. She is worried that if her parents begin contacting her therapist and psychiatrist again, they will be able to have have her committed once again . 

What are her options to make sure her parents do not harass her anymore in her apartment? She is not manic or delusional or a harm to herself no others- what should she do? I suggested she change her locks and file a police report detailing her parents harassing behavior.

4,Illegal Dealership Fees in Georgia,1589038403,"Hey everyone,

I'm trying to figure out what to do in regards to purchasing a new motorcycle.  In the state of Georgia, it is illegal for a dealership to advertise the price of a vehicle and then tack on extra fees such as dealership fees and whatnot.  Only government fees can be added afterwards. The links to the law can be found in several locations here from the state:

 [http://consumer.ga.gov/uploads/Auto\_Informer\_-\_Issue\_13\_1.22.2016.pdf](http://consumer.ga.gov/uploads/Auto_Informer_-_Issue_13_1.22.2016.pdf) 

 [http://consumer.ga.gov/uploads/pdf/AAEP\_-\_Revised\_102518.pdf](http://consumer.ga.gov/uploads/pdf/AAEP_-_Revised_102518.pdf)  

I have already been to several dealerships to purchase a bike and they all say the fees aren't illegal at all.  That's how they stay in business.  However, when I show them the law that states all fees have to be included in the advertised price online minus only government fees such as tax tag title, they all just say I'm wrong and they won't do anything about it.  I called the governors office and they said I can file a report on each dealership but they only act if either A) I have a contract showing they added fees afterwards or B) they get so many alerts from people that shows a trend. 

My question is, what would ya'll do?  Do I just suck it up, pay the fees and then go argue it in small claims court since the law is on my side?  How can I get the state to enforce their own laws or even the dealership to see reason?  Apparently every dealership is still doing this. I just went through this two months ago on a new car for my wife and the dealership took all the fees off the moment I pulled the law up and they of course played dumb.",legaladvice,False,krautman581945,/r/legaladvice/comments/gghfj1/illegal_dealership_fees_in_georgia/

11,[PA] Dog adoption agency reclaimed our dog and is holding her hostage,1589037473,"I’m not sure how to start this, but I’ll try to make this as concise as possible.
Three weeks ago my 20 week old dog was taken to the vet for breathing issues, they’ve continuously gotten worse. 7 vet trips in they think she has PDA (an enlarged heart). Their advice was to take her to a specialty veterinary clinic. The issue is it is expensive, very expensive. The adoption agency we bought our dogs from offered to pay for part of the medical bills. The only catch is, is that apparently for that to happen we had to give “legal ownership” to the agency. My parents obliged and now my dog is being kept at the specialty clinic. Apparently there’s an experimental surgery that could be performed on my dog to possibly save her, but it would cost us $2k and the agency $5k. 
This leaves us in a difficult situation, we (or technically the adoption agency) have a dying dog that has a small survival chance, and a multi-thousand-dollar experimental cure. Me and my family have been thinking and though we love our dog, it would be easier for us and her to just put her down. The issue is, is the adoption agency won’t return legal ownership to us unless we pay our $2k, and if we don’t they’ll perform the surgery without us, and then re-sell our dog.

I took a recent interest into creating such a book but I thought of just referencing the stories and evolving their plots (not citing direct words, exact scenarios, names or places etc.) I would probably exaggerate some to the extent so that they couldn't be tracked back to the original content.

By doing so, would I be stealing intellectual property?

18,"Lived at an address for a month and landlord put bills in my name for a year. I got notified 6 years later, do I have to pay for it?",1589036687,"For context, I am a foreign student in the UK. I received my unconditional letter in June, and applied for student halls once registration opened about week later.
Now, I wanted to get a job to pay for my accommodation, food, etc (being from outside the UK I wasn't eligible for maintenance grants), so I decided to move to the UK a month prior to University starting (on 20th Sep 2014) so I could get a job before all the students got there and applied for them. So I booked a flight for the 13th of August 2014.
My student halls wouldn't accept students moving in prior to the 20th of September, so I needed a place to stay for the period between arriving at England and moving into the halls. 
By late July, however, I still hadn't had a definitive answer as to whether my application for the Halls had been successful, so as a precautionary measure, I contacted several landlords, mentioning I'd need a place for this short period prior to 20th Sep. but could possibly need it for the entire year should my application fall through.
I exchanged a couple of emails with a landlord who was happy to oblige. So I arrive on 13th, they ask me for the rent for the entire month plus bills. Cash. There and then. I told them I could only take so much from an ATM daily so I could give them 2/3 now and the rest at a later date. They said OK, I handed the money, they then made me sign the tenancy agreement (more on that in a bit) and I asked to write me an invoice (my dad had drilled it into my 18yo skull, and I can't thank him enough for it). They were quite reluctant as hadn't brought anything to do it but eventually produced an invoice pad from their car, hand wrote one for the amount, gave it to me and left. 
2 days later, I received confirmation of my place at Uni Halls from 20th Sep on, at which time I contact the landlord via phone, let them know and we agree the next time they come down I'll pay the remaining rent for the month + bills for the month. The 2nd (last) invoice I got read 'Balance of rent + part (or ract? It was mostly unintelligible) payment bills'. On the 20th of Sep I move into halls and post my key through the letterbox as they couldn't come and collect it so told me to do this. 

Congratulations for making it through that huge wall of exposition, but we're here now. 6 years later, in the midst of a pandemic and I receive 2 letters from a debt collection agency claiming I owe them gas + electricity for the period of 13/08/2014 - 05/07/2015.
Now, obviously I haven't lived there for this period of time, and I obtained confirmation from my University in writing to state I was contracted with them during these dates, but this raises a couple of questions.

1) It's possible I signed the tenancy agreement for the whole year, since as I mentioned, I hadn't had confirmation. Perhaps I shouldn't, but hey, hindsight. If that is true, am I liable for this bill even though I contacted my landlord and we agreed on a final figure, but didn't sign any further documentation on? (like a termination of the agreement)

2) If we're being pragmatic, there's slim chance a student is renting a property WHILST being simmultaneously contracted with student halls, but I'm not sure if proof that I wasn't living at that address at the time is sufficient to sustain my claim that I should not be liable for these bills.


I'm sure there's things I've forgotten to mention which may be of use to know, like for example I do not have access to the tenancy agreement now, but I still have in my possession the invoices.

Anything else that comes up I'll make sure to update this accordingly.

32,Cutting University Group Members for Product Continuation,1589034626,"Originally posted on r/cscareerquestions but was removed and directed to post here.

Hi All,

I had a question regarding potential legal pitfalls of venture I am considering undertaking. I am a university student, and for the past semester have been working on a software project in a small group for a class. For the final deliverable, we produced a working prototype of the software, and after demonstrating the idea to professors, friends, and family, I decided that I would be really interested in moving forward with the project beyond the class and attempting to release the software, with the possibility of incorporating monetization somehow. I talked to my friend in the group and he felt the same way.

However, we would like to keep the other two group members uninvolved in the continuation of the project. They quite frankly did not contribute very much during the semester, and my friend and I strongly believe that we would work much better without them. In fact, if they had to be involved for any reason I would rather forego working on this project and spend my time elsewhere. In terms of contributions, the other two members only completed one or two mock business elements for the class and a few slides on our final pitch deck. Neither of them contributed any code that made it into the submitted deliverable, and contributed &lt;20 lines each in total throughout the semester (and yes, the project in total was thousands of lines of code). I did a vast majority of the code, while my friend handled the designs, wire-frames, asset creation, and a bunch of the business stuff.

Bottom line is that the two of us would like to continue working on this project beyond the scope of our class which is now over, but we want to cut out two of the group members who didn't contribute much despite being ask to several times and given many opportunities to do so in multiple areas. However, we wouldn't want this to come back and bite us in the rear, legally speaking, if we were to publish the software especially if we monetize it. Ethically speaking we are totally fine with the situation since the other members were very hard to deal with and earnestly did not contribute, but we don't want to get sued or anything (we both live in the United States if that makes a difference). Are there any considerations we need to take if we move forward, or is this something that we should not do unless everyone is working on it?

TLDR: Want to publish software made as part of a university project and potentially monetize it. Also want to cut out half of the group from the class who didn't contribute.

38,Unemployment: Do I have to accept a job rehire offer that explicitly doesn't guarantee CONTINUED employment?,1589032308,"I'm in a bit of a bind. Like so many others during the pandemic, I was laid off in late March from a small business that could not continue to pay staff for the foreseeable future, so I am on unemployment. Yesterday, my former employer extended a rehire offer to me and a bunch of my former co-workers stating that their Paycheck Protection Loan from the SBA has finally gone through... but that there will be enough funds for 6-7 weeks and that ""we'll see where we are then."" That, to me, among a few other things, was unsettling as it implies we could all be laid off AGAIN when funds run out. The hours (full-time) and pay are generally the same, but continuation of employment doesn't seem to be guaranteed.

Most of the business revenue comes from wholesaling our products; we have a retail section that's keeping it afloat but, when it comes down it, is not really carrying the weight of how much the business has lost and continues to lose in wholesale revenue. I am including this bit of info as I believe it attests to the high potential for this small business to not make it through this pandemic. Especially as so many of our wholesale clients as already out of business themselves—there's almost no way they would be able to afford to pay us after the loan runs out, it would almost guarantee be the same situation again as when they originally laid us off.

I looked up what counts as ""unsuitable"" employment offers that you can turn down while on unemployment, but 'no guarantee of continued employment' doesn't seem to be one of them. Of course, considering the times, it wouldn't have been a common enough occurrence normally. Would this job offer count as a 'gig' then? My gut tells me this is quite unsuitable, but I may have no legal standing.

The worst part is, if it *doesn't* fall into the clearly unsuitable category legally, I can't really say no. If I refuse, I am liable to lose unemployment benefits. So it puts me and my other former co-workers in a tough spot, forcing us to say yes even if we have reservations about it.

Also for one, aside from one hint in one email, they never **explicitly** stated that they were interested in rehiring me if they could—not when I was originally laid off and not until now. A few of us (my coworkers) were totally shocked. I wasn't even marking myself as ""temporarily employed"" but seeking alternate employment. A few of us had even found employment elsewhere.

Secondly, they sent the email yesterday (Friday late afternoon) and expect a reply by Sunday and return to work by this Monday, which feels very fast to me and allows me only one full day to really mull it over.

I called the number on their website just to be given another number by an automated message, calling that one and finding out its down right now.

All of a sudden I get a message back on Instagram from them and the rep tries to buy me off with ""expedited shipping"" (already signed up from 1-3 days shipping before) and a free ashtray, but I could cancel still if I wanted to. I told them I had already canceled with my bank and I wanted this order canceled on their end too. The rep doesn't respond. Later at 9pm I get an email saying my order has shipped!

46,Possible wrongful termination (NV) advice,1589031000,"I worked at a large bank for nearly 3 years. I was exceptional in sales goals, customer service, and never once disciplined for any reason during this time. I was promoted 3 times. 


In March 2020, I decided to file an HR complaint on my branch manager. The company requires us as employees to report possible illegal or unethical behavior. I was moving to a new role which involved traveling and would soon not work under the manager. I knew of inappropriate behaviors and sexual encounters between a banker, mortgage rep, district manager, and teller, and heavy favoritism based on romantic reciprocation. Those behaviors had become extreme when I decided to report. I hesitated for a time due to the potential of retaliation. The teller did not reciprocate and in turn was not treated as well. My complaint mentioned this and other well known details by others so I could remain as annonymous as possible. The manager and myself had been friends as I did not want to give myself a difficult work life, but his behavior on countless occasions was not appropriate and often sexually driven. 


When i spoke to an HR investigator about the treatment of others, issues of favoritism, and an inappropriate work relationship, the investigator seemed only interested in the excessive gifts the manager bought a coworker he was romantically interested in. He had twiced asked her to go on a date with him and admitted so, when that is strictly against bank policy due to conflict of interest. I knew this coworker was not romantically interested in return but didn't want her exceptional treatment to change. It was found that the manager was written up for the gifts. In banking, gifts to clients, coworkers, or mortgage partners insinuates possible bribary, legal issues, and unfair treatment. 


This bank also has an extensive ethics policy handbook that can be found online. Early on it preaches the ""do the right thing"" and ensures anonymity(when possible) as well as a zero tolerance policy for employees who are retaliated against for filing a report. The HR investigator I first spoke with told me to reach out to the regional HR representative if I experienced retaliation.


Somehow my identity was known only days after the report and the manager as well as other coworkers were extremely upset for me blowing the whistle. I was treated terribly and excessively micro managed which I had never experienced before. I was scolded and asked to forge paperwork(i believe was an attempt to fire me then but i refused) I documented the incidents that were blatantly wrong with the witnesses and forwarded them to the regional HR rep, as instructed when you experience retaliation. I then speak with another HR rep who doubted my allegations, but all were confirmed by other employees who witnessed some. Weeks pass and the treatment continued to an unbearable level, and I began to take anxiety medication to cope and even told the HR rep I had clinical depression and anxiety and the hostile environment was becoming too much to for me. 


I then was told I was being forced to relocate to another branch this manager also manages 50% of the time. It was not the branch I had applied for and I planned on working. It was then I emailed the regional HR a final time saying I felt nothing was being done and I would not tolerate the retaliatory treatment any longer. I also explained the manager has had many sexual relationships at work and also made me uncomfortable on numerous occasions. I then got a final call from a 3rd HR rep who asked more about the sexual misconduct/harrassment. I gave her names of witnesses and people who knew or saw the same things I did. This was never followed up on. I asked one coworker who experienced inappropiate sexual conduct if she was reached out to, and she told me she was not. It is my understanding all companies are required to in good faith investigate all sexual harrassment claims regardless of their feelings on probability of the incidents. This did not happen and this bank claims to follow through on such claims in addition to retaliation. From what I have read, most companies lose lawsuits by default when they don't investigate protected activities correctly.


I moved to my new role and location and would still see this manager in passing but we did not speak. I felt things were improving but I was also on a project that didn't involve interaction with him. During my first HR investigator call, I sent text messages and work messages supporting my early claim. After the complaint of retaliation I was never asked for more evidence nor for any regarding sexual misconduct. I was asked for names and the bank did not ask those individuals about the accusation. 


On Wednesday April 29, the company sent a mass email to all employees putting dollar amounts on gift giving, I am assuming because of my original HR complaint.

No one was ever disciplined regarding my complaint(less a minor write-up) but instead the company revised its policy. On Friday, May 1st, the district manager came in at the end of my shift and put me on a conference call with the regional HR representative. In a minute or less, she told me I was being terminated as the investigation was closed and they found I complained in bad faith. She also added I had said unkind things about coworkers but did not say who or when. For months I had kept to myself and always treated my coworkers with respect while we worked together. Had they fired me for any other reason(as a model employee they could not find anything it seems), I know I would be screwed due to being an at-will state.

I am seeking your advice and help as when I draw this map together, I realize none of this would have happened if I didn't ""whistleblow"".... The sequence of events I believe proves this as well as ignoring a sexual harrassment allegation and well documented retaliation. I see a huge issue after reading state and federal guidelines for whistleblowing/sexual harrassment/retaliation and see a large difference here vs a typical Nevada at will termination. I made reasonable attempts with my employer through the proper channels and policy to correct this, and the employer responded negatively and retalitory. I am a realist and am not sure if this is worth fighting and would appreciate that guidance. As far as ""bad faith""... I was moving branches and had nothing to gain from saying anything...i have plenty of proof of my allegations...my goal was to protect future employees and create a fair environment for the ones there. My employer without a doubt in my mind can't prove I reported in bad faith, and I was ultimately let go for whistleblowing and being a liability if these behaviors continued.

I am seeking impartial advice about legal recourse. Do i have a case? Does it fall under whistleblower, retaliation, or sexual harrassment protections? I am totally okay with moving on with my life...it won't bother me either way if I pursue legal action or not. However it is no secret banks often legally f*ck up, and this particular one attempts to protect its reputation at all costs.",legaladvice,False,Funtilitwasntanymore,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggfg5p/possible_wrongful_termination_nv_advice/

I would do my work. Ask my bosses questions about policies and what not and made sure to stay in constant contact. I had no inkling they were going to fire me. 

I had let it be known that I suffered from some mental illnesses but they’re under control with medication. Yesterday I get called to come to the actual office where they terminated my employment, stating my anxiety was an issue. I had worked in that field for years with the same mental health issues and never once had a problem. I know Mississippi is an at-will state but can they fire me because of my mental illness? I feel that’s discrimination. 

I think they expected me to get cry or something, but as I mentioned, I have control over my anxiety and depression so I didn’t. They were handing me tissues and I was asking questions about unemployment and what this meant about me as I am the breadwinner of my family. I have a husband partially disabled as well as taking care of his elderly grandfather. These were things I was upfront and honest with them when I interviewed and they hired me same day.

COPD cough. He recommended she get tested, but she’s hardheaded and refused, even going as far as to rip up the prescription for her test. &lt;insert HUGE eye roll here&gt;

My sister’s boyfriend is a very private, relatively paranoid person. He’s not going to want to give me any paperwork with his information on it to provide to my employer.

65,"Shorted on my pay, app I'm working through claims that it's acceptable",1589026570,"So I've been working on this new app called Wonolo. It allows you to take all sorts of different jobs as an independent contractor.

I did a bunch of jobs at a big pharmacy chain. At most of the jobs the staffing agency that sends me there never informed the store I was coming nor were they aware that such staffing agency even existed and there usually isn't much work to be done.

On most occasions, the managers would send everyone home early. There isn't enough work to be done in a small store for the employees so they generally can't find things for three extra people to do for 6 and a half hours.

Now, in the app, jobs are usually advertised as a flat day rate pay. I have seen jobs advertising an hourly pay, but all the ones I've taken were the flat day rate.

In this case, the job was advertised as $97.50 total pay. Nowhere else was there any indication that pay would be hourly. Generally, the staffing agency had been paying me in full.

Now, the last four jobs that I've completed for them they've begun to pay me less than what was advertised.

This is the latest response I got from Wonolo:

""When you sign up for the app, you accept the Terms of Use that state you are an independent contractor. Please see Section 3.

 

As an independent contractor, Wonoloers may be paid by the hour the same rate, no matter how many hours he or she works; is not covered by the employer’s workers’ compensation insurance, and may shoulder additional tax burdens. 

 

It also states therein that ""Wonolo does not pay a salary or hourly rate but rather facilitates Requestor’s payment of the rate set by the Requestor;""

 

Since the job that you accepted at *staffing agency* had a disclaimer ""We will be validating payment off of the store timesheets."",   this implied payment is in accordance to the amount of time spent on each job.

 

Though it may not have explicitly indicated an hourly pay but it was clear from the disclaimer alone that payment is subject to confirmation or validation, depending on the timesheet information. This would justify accurate payment for a Wonoloer who worked 1 hour against one who worked for 6 hours.

I've always had bad luck with women, and when they come in my life I try everything not to lose them. I've even been often times questioning my sexuality. Maybe I try so hard with keeping people around because these women are my ""beards"" Idk. Some more background too is that I started at a 4 year college then took a year off, after having a mental breakdown and attempting suicide which resulted in a being placed in a pysch ward. A huge issue I have is saying no to people, and just in general being too nice. Also this is in New York.

Not that the background is out of the way. Basically a few years ago this whole nightmare started a few years back, I matched with this really pretty girl on Tinder. We talked for a little bit, and I ended up taking her on a couple dates. She gave me a blowjob (Which I didn't get hard for) and I went down on her. A few months later I got a phone call from her dad and literally my stomach dropped so far when he told me her daughter was underage (15). This happened when I was 22. A couple months later she reached out to me again and apologized. We were talking and this girl is really intelligent. we just kept being friends which was not smart on my part at all. I later went back to college and I started seeing another women who is my now girlfriend and is amazing. But this is the part that's really bad. The underage girl was now 16 by now. She starts this off by telling me ""I want to send you a pic, but I can't"". and me being an idiot I tell her go for it. She sends me an underwear picture. 

This caused the situtation to spiral like crazy. Basically we sent nudes literally all the time while I was dating my girlffriend. I was even sending nudes to guys. (I've talked to my girlfriend about some of this). It was really bad, I didn't realize it but I was kinda grooming her. Which is awful, I just thought I was being nice and we were having fun. This went on for 4 months. It didn't stop until her friend called me up and told me how much of a piece of shit I was being. It took that to make realize, and take a step back. 

I thought that I did enough to protect myself. I deleted all social media and blocked her from my laptop (I have a mac). But not on my phone. Now this girl has contacted just recently a few times. Since quarentine has started maybe 5. (She follows my girlfriend on instagram, so the calls typically come when my girlfriend makes a post. Ususaly I ignore the calls since they're really late at night. But I picked up one, last month and she calling me a sexual predator, and that I was the adult. And really laying into me about it about how much of a garbage person I am.  She called again last night, I picked it up and talked to her. She told me how she learned the grooming and that i groomed her. (which is disgusting). She told me about how she was thinking of messaging my girlfriend about everything. But what I'm getting to is she told me she talked to people and she told me what charges I could be looking at. She said she isn't sure about pressing charges. I want both the girl and I to be at peace. I told her that.

What my question is, is what can I do to protect myself? I've told my best friend everything. I didn't try to sugarcoat anything. He really recommended I stop contact. A

77,What is corporate governance for the customer?,1589018881," TL:DR at bottom

Question (rant below) - Legally speaking, shouldn't Microsoft do more is my general question?

I will leave out specific names of the third parties. I have a problem with Microsoft.

I freely admit I ""made a mistake"" in purchasing Microsoft office 2016 pro. My mistake was googling where to purchase a full edition of office as I do not want to have a subscription for 365 (Id rather pay for the full product as a stand alone). Following google links etc, I came across a site that, looks just like any other ""digital key"" selling site. I made the purchase and got my code.

Here is where Microsoft FAILED. First of all, I ""must of"" been the first person with this key for the server to accept the key. It worked for 6 months. One day it was turned off. I have recently tried to use it again as I needed to use Office for a reason (I hardly use it and usually use my work to do ""stuff""), and the key BLOCKED. My issue is that Microsoft DOES NOT tell me.

If someone smashed you window and I recorded it and refused to even tell you or hand you the CCTV I have, this would be selfish and not right. Basically Microsoft knew I had a bad key, knew it got used multiple times and never emailing me (they have my account and email details, they even have my card details saved!!)

Why do Microsoft BLOCK people keys and not even give them a courtesy email. On top of this, Microsoft KNOW who is selling the keys. I spoke to a agent today via the chat and although they had all the corporate responses to give me and ""free 3 months 365 subscription"" and advised me to report it to the scam team.

I can see, for example, on tomshardware website that people were talking about this company, this exact scam and program I ordered. This is from 2017. 3 YEARS AGO. Does corporate governance and ""goodwill"" only extend to themselves?

Just to recap or ask my question. Third party websites have FOR YEARS been selling office pro keys to people and scamming them. Microsoft knows this, the world does (except me at the time). This is the persons fault for not getting from the authorized list (you have to do research to find out who is ""authorized"") or get directly. Microsoft then go on to block the key after it is used by multiple people. Yet Microsoft DOES NOT email them (even if they have that persons details from the account).. Microsoft also TAKES NO ACTION about these websites. The site still sells Microsoft products today. The third party is based ""in the west"" and Hong Kong.

Can Microsoft start emailing affected customers?

Without naming the company directly (indirectly ""GEE TWO""), why have third parties been allowed to sell illegitimate Microsoft products for YEARS, using the same domain and offices?

The above two questions would be directed to Microsoft but this is the kind of question people must naturally ask. What is the point in corporations having the publicity to say the are ""good and law abiding"" yet don't even help their neighbors out by giving them CCTV of a crime that has happened.

# Pregnancy and relationship

📷

Thankyou to whoever is taking time to read it. Its long but precise enough to help me with some advice.

I had a relationship with my ex for two years and we broke up due to some family issues. After a while he lied to me and it was all for another girl. I started drinking with my friends and one day( July 2019) I met one of my friends friend ABC. (I will keep the name ABC to avoid identity bad mouthing). I kinda liked him and started flirting (even though I wasn't over my ex- my first mistake). ABC look quite disturbed and eventually he shared what was wrong with him. He had financial issues has his Immigration status was going to expire. He was short of 3000$ and I started trusting him so much in few days that I made an arrangement for the money he was short. In a few days he had issues with his roommates and he moved out. I asked him to come to my place. My ex and I share a dog in common and he use to come visit him. So whenever he use to come I asked ABC to sleep outside because I didn't want my ex to think ill of me. In a way I mistreated ABC. One day two of my friends came to see me from far and we went for dinner and it was too late for them to drive home. So I asked them to sleep at mine. They came and ABC thought I slept with one of them which I didn't. He started having character issues with me and meanwhile during that process I started realizing my mistakes and fell In love with him. He started getting abusive day by day, violent, humiliated me in front of his friends, even showed his pe\*\*s out of his pants in front of his friends and asked me to have it if I am too much into sex. I still continued facing all that because of the guilt I had for mistreating him. Me and ABC weren't dating and it was all physical because he wasn't interested In me. Dec 2020 we had unprotected intercourse, and Feb 2020 2nd week I got to know I am pregnant. I was ready to abort it but was waiting for some financial support from back home. mean while I had an ultrasound and got attached to the baby and didn't wanted to end the pregnancy . I told ABC about it and gave him full assurity that he would never even have to pay a penny for the child. But he started calling me names like prostitute, child eater and stuff like that. Now he is forcing me to abort or he will make my life hell. What should I do. I am getting depressed and helpless day by day. He sleeps in my room and I sleep on the stairs. I am just too scared to hear those words again. He even said that he never enjoyed getting physical with me( after 9 months ) and he just did it so I wouldn't go to any other guy. He says I planned pregnancy against his will. I have appoitment proof for abortion, pictures of injuries from his abuse but do not want to get him in trouble because I love him. I do not want to loose my child at any cost. I asked him that I will sign the papers that you won't be liable about anything but he is not listening.

I honestly do not want Child Support or anything to do with him. I just want my child.'",legaladvice,False,simsharma,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggctcf/forced_abortionunwanted_pregnancy_mess/
80,Used a fake billing address shopping a software in a US store from EU. What should I do? What kind of repercussions am I facing?,1589018212,"Hello guys,

I have recently bought a software license from a US store. I was looking for a deal and I found a link to the US-store of this software, so I have decided to bought it. The store is a huge seller of this kind of product. When doing the check out it requires me a billing address and, since I saw it requires a us address, I have use a fake generator address - I know, that is stupid. I have gone through the checkout using my paypal account (where inside I have everything real) and the order was completed.

Yesterday I suggested a friend of mine to buy that software from there, but he was more careful then me and he found out that you can change the billing address to a european one. Problem is the price is higher and it is probably due to the fact that I avoid paying VAT.

So, now I am panic and I would like to do something to fix this mistake. What I would like to do is to contact the store and ask for help, checking the possibility to make the order regular, but I am not sure this can be done and, on the opposite side, I think this would makes me in troubles more than I am now.

82,"Buying house, sign additional addendum",1589015392,"Well, guess it’s my turn.

So I’m buying a townhome. Closing date all set and signed by both parties on addendum.  Well, cabinet makers were shutdown for a short time and now it’s changing my closing date from (22nd) to later the following month (02nd). 

They are trying to get me to sign the addendum, and relieve themselves of any thing extra costs associated with me being displaced or my belongings.

They have tried telling me that I should get an Airbnb, hotel and other things that would be coming out of my pocket, as well as a storage facility or pod for temporary storage needs.

The townhome is new construction and they are doing things to get it all ready in time and even asked to sign a zero day walk and they would come fix later.

The sales person/realtor just dumped me after papers were signed and haven’t heard from them, but the others are picking up their slack.

I’ve been walking the house and giving them a list of items that need correcting so there isn’t a list for this zero day walk they are proposing.

I will lose my rate lock a few days before the “new” close date and they offered to pay that to extend, but nothing else.

So I was wondering, is my thinking correct that if I sign the new closing date addendum which gives me no moving time to relocate belongings and displaces me and my child for a few days.....I’m S.O.L?  They are fully aware that I’m a single surviving parent and expect me to cover the cost from them being contractually late/delayed on the contract.

What can I do, as time is coming up fast and I need to take appropriate action.

90,Apartment Parking Lawsuit/ Collections,1589012560,"So I lived in an apartment in Los Angeles, CA during 2018-2019. My girlfriend was the main signer of the lease, with her mom as a guarantor, and I was on the lease as occupant. The first apartment manager working there was very chill, lenient with the rules. Super nice guy. The parking in the building was paid PER CAR, and open parking, meaning no assigned spots. You paid monthly for your parking pass, and parked anywhere in the garage. The apartment manager gave me a garage gate key, and told me not to worry about paying the extra parking fee. I had never paid this fee, I guess he thought my girlfriend paying for her one spot was enough money spent for the both of us to park there. Like I said, really chill guy. 

The problem arises after we moved out. I had parked in the garage throughout the entire duration of the lease. A situation happened where the original manager was fired, a new manager took over, and corporate managers started heavily managing the building. This was a mess. Everything changed. The living situation became uncomfortable and we even got them to agree to cutting our lease short because of all of the problems we were having there, but we didn't end up moving out early because of the headache. So we stayed throughout the lease duration. 

After we left, everything seemed fine. About a week later, a ludicrous bill comes in for painting fees and overdue parking fees. We contested the painting fees, as we have a walkthrough on video of the manager saying everything looked fine and they even marked down a chart saying there would be minimal fees for screw holes in the wall. The unpaid and overdue parking fees came as a huge confusion. I was told not to worry about it! I was given a parking garage gate key and was never once asked to pay the parking fee while living there!

Now without contacting us much about the bill, they have sent the parking bill to collections, under my girlfriend and her mothers name. They knew the parking bill was because of my car. I was on the lease as an occupant. They have my information. I believe they're specifically going after the stronger party who holds more money and assets on purpose. On top of sending it to collections during a global pandemic, which I suspect is because they're down money on rent because tenants can't pay and they know they can't do anything about that. 

I'm asking for advice on what to do here. Does this bill need to be paid? Is this legal for them to do? They sent it to collections with minimal contact to us, from my understanding. Can I have the bill placed in my name instead? What's my best course of action here? Thank you all!",legaladvice,False,YungDemon,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggbokg/apartment_parking_lawsuit_collections/

92,[AU] Retailer says that it would take a while to repair my device - when I see it on sale in their shop.,1589012307,"A large retailer here has a product care/warranty where if your device is faulty, they will do a repair. If they can't repair, then you are given a replacement or store credit. However if you choose a replacement or store credit, then you lose your warranty.

I was told by their repair center that it would take at least 5 weeks to repair my device due to parts not being available. So, I chose to have a replacement - which I was told there was none and that I would be given store credit instead.

Today I went to look for a new device, and I saw that there was another exact device in stock. This isn't an issue except I noticed a scratch like my old device had. I can prove that it was my device as I have the serial number. This means that if I bought it again, I would lose money, as I'd have to buy warranty again. If I kept my old device, I would've lost no money.

My question is, could I do anything about this? It feels like they knew that 5 weeks was too long of a wait, and decided to make me drop the repair so that I would have to buy a new device and thus re-buy the warranty instead of getting the fixed device without warranty.

Days went by and the woman asks for pictures of the blood and cut finger. These were sent. Many go by and I have no answer on the warranty. I call and I’m told I will need to send a photo of the service tag and some information. Unfortunately by this time I have begun my move to another state and leave the $3000 paper weight behind.

One other rep told me I was lying to Company because I said my laptop would be delivered in NEW STATE after I moved, however because of the virus I had to cancel those plans over fear of transmission to me or my RELATIVE who would be shipping the device but currently is undergoing chemo and shouldn’t expose herself.

I do believe I let my temper get the best of my after month two and I had to apologize for raising my voice over the phone, though I never insulted anyone nor talked poorly about the product.

97,Auto Dealers Fraud has been Destroying my Credit for years,1589011808," Six years ago when I was young and naive, I got talked into financing a $30,000 car. I remember being shocked at how easy and fast the financing process was, as I initially thought I’d get denied due to my bad credit and low income. During the whole entire car buying process I was not asked for, nor did I provide any type of identification, proof of insurance, proof of residency, or proof of income. I was given a one page application to fill, talked for a bit, signed a contract and drove off. Being as this was my first time buying a new car, I guess I let my excitement of getting approved outweigh my skepticism of the whole experience.
About a year passes and I receive a call from my mother (whom I haven’t lived with in years) saying that Bayport Credit Union called her and said they put a forced coverage on my car (due to accidental 30 day lapse in insurance). I then proceed to call Bay Port CU, and during this conversation Im asked if I’m still employed as an electrician, at this shipyard two hours away from where I was living. This was extremely odd to me as it wasn’t even close to what I put on my application (waiting tables). For the next ten months I had to pay an additional three hundred a month  on top of my car payment.. another 6 months later and I couldn’t do it anymore so I told them to come get my car. 
After they repossessed my car I checked my credit report and discovered that they have falsely reported 9 different late payments in a years time. I have (and still do) bank statements proving all 9 of those payments were on time as I had reoccurring bill pay set up. 
As if that wasn’t bad enough, a year latter I get a call from my mother (once again), saying that they delivered a warrant in dept to her address summoning me to court for the remaining outstanding balance after the car was auctioned off ($9000) and $2500 in court fees..

The laptop is worth south of $3000. And is really an important investment in my new business. I’m saving to get a new one but cannot continue my work until I do.

I did get theatric in my plea with many agents during my many calls to dell. However I feel justified considering the time crunch during which the claim occurred and the fact that the laptop wasn’t working before the blood was spilled. I said “well I might as well have aids” to the phone rep in an sarcastic manner considering how they were treating it as a biohazard. One other rep told me I was lying to dell because I said my laptop would be delivered in Denver after I moved, however because of the virus I had to cancel those plans over fear of transmission to me or my mother who would be shipping the device but currently is undergoing chemo and shouldn’t expose herself.

I do believe I let my temper get the best of my after month two and I had to apologize for raising my voice over the phone, though I never insulted anyone nor talked poorly about the product. The laptop was covered under warranty and it took dell months to give me an answer. I also injured myself while following instructions from a phone rep.

What is my course of action. I am willing to drop it and go save for something else if there is a chance a suit or arbitration will cost me anything.",legaladvice,False,ZachtieTV,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggbahg/dell_is_refusing_to_warranty_my_laptop_and_their/
2,Breaking lease early due to uninhabitable situation,1589010610,"State: CA

I've recently lost a bike that was tied to my balcony (I'm on the first floor). This happened while I was asleep at night, during the shelter-in-place period. It's almost impossible for someone to reach and grab from the outside of the balcony - someone has to have jumped over the fence and then grab it. I do live in a gated community (so it's gated, and then I have a 6ft tall wall around the balcony). I don't feel safe living in this unit anymore so I have tried to contact the leasing office to transfer to another unit but they have failed to respond back to me for 3 weeks.

Due to increase in thefts and car break-ins due to economy pitfall, I'm pretty confident more thefts will happen. What really concerns me is though there is no surveillance system to the gate of the community, and the balcony door is very.. balcony-door-ish. Meaning it has a huge square-glass in the middle that anyone can break in. It was not really a problem when I moved in, but now I actually experienced burglary, I do feel little unsafe and the leasing office has done no effort to do accommodate. Actually, even before trying to accommodate, they have ignored my calls and when they picked up and said the manager will get back to me, she never did. I don't even know if she got the message tbh. Can this be suitable for uninhabitable situation?

4,Civil rights violated by police dept . I want to file a lawsuit! Help :(,1589010252,"I’m a 20 yr old black Muslim women. I got arrested last week. If you know about Islam, this month is Ramadan where we fast from sunrise to sunset. When the cops arrested me, they kept me in the cop car from 6pm to around 12. I was begging for water. It was my first time ever being arrested. I was crying and upset thinking my life would be over because of my situation. 
The cops didn’t care that it was Ramadan and I needed to break my fast with something. I felt like I was about to pass out I was so dehydrated especially from all this stress and anxiety from being handcuffed in a cop car :(. I was begging for water I said please give me water , I’m so thirsty. They said no. We were right next to the station. The cop said we don’t go on your time. The cop was playing video games on his phone. They don’t care.

Another thing happened that is way worse. They violated my 1st amendment rights. 

When we got to the department for booking. I got my fingerprints done. Then, I had to get my mugshot. The two ladies taking the photo said I have to take it off. I said NO! It’s my religion and I’m Muslim. I wear a hijab and I’m not taking it off. Back and forth for so long about how I didn’t want to take it off.  I don’t want to take it off..my religion ..no. The cops around me made me feel very threatened.  I told the ladies at least I need the two guy cops to leave the room while I take this picture. I can’t have men look at my hair.. they turned around. 

Next, I had to go to the actual JAIL for the night and do the same thing. ANOTHER MUGSHOT photo. This time there was around 30 cops when I entered. Most of them were male. They told me I had to take it off right away. I said no. I am not taking it off. It is part of my religion I am not, this is NOT FAIR. the women cop said you have to. I said no it’s my religious rights to keep it. The one male cop behind me said “NO you have NO RIGHTS when you’re in jail”? I said no I’m not taking it off. One cop said we don’t want to have to take it off. So I took it off because I felt threatened that all these cops will hurt me. They all stared while I took it off.

It was so humiliating. I never took my hijab off in public before. I didn’t even feel like a human. I loved wearing my hijab, they stripped my rights away from me. 

When I get a cup and spoon from the police, THeres a green paper they give everyone that states the rights in jail.  “Allowed to wear religious wear, etc. allowed to report sexual assault etc.  but the cop told me I had no rights and they took of my hijab for a mugshot. I had to see a judge without my hijab and my family saw me without it as well. 

This is all I can think about every single day. Coming back from jail, I see so many cases from police brutality /inequality. Just makes me even more angry at the police. I hate the police. They are not for the people. They treat people like me UNEQUALLY. 

It is not fair. They caused me emotional stress. Every time I look at my hijab that it is all I think about. Every time I see police, I see how badly I was treated.

I need help, I want to file a lawsuit against the city that did this to me. I’m sure they did this to so many Muslim women, but they didn’t have the money or time to do so. I have seen many cases online where Muslim women with the same situation as mine have won lawsuits..

I want to make a change. This shouldn’t happen to Muslims or anybody who wears religious covering. 

How can the police stripe me out my hijab for a mugshot for identification purposes, but for a driver lisence or ID , I can wear it? Obv I think they are against Muslims and are islamaphobic. We are treated like animals to these police. 

How much do you think this lawsuit will cost me for a civil rights lawyer? Might contact my mosque about this issue as well. This will look really bad on that police department.",legaladvice,False,Initial_Teampanther,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggb7uu/civil_rights_violated_by_police_dept_i_want_to/

A few weeks ago I was on a conference call and for some reason I turned on my video. I was the only one out of 6 people with video on. The call was boring and I was not planning to say anything.

Hello,

My 18-month deferred prosecution agreement is set to expire in mid-June. I believe I did everything correctly, and I sent in all of my paperwork (proof of counseling, mental health evaluation, etc.) to the district attorney's office, more specifically their deferred prosecution department. Part of the agreement is not committing anything above a Class C moving traffic offense, which I have avoided.

I can't help but notice that I may have gotten an assessment about a week late, although I am not even sure if the stipulation applies to my conditions because it is much further down in the agreement. I am freaking out, but I don't know if I am being irrational.

After sending my documents to the DA's office, I was told that they had received my documents and that they would do a final review for compliance on the due date. I can contact them for my case status after the due date. They also reminded me that I cannot commit another offense leading up to the mid-June due date.

My main question is: would they have informed me if I had violated the deferred prosecution agreement when I sent in all of my paperwork? Am I in the clear as long as I do commit another offense until the due date?

If you don't know the answer, do you know of where I could go to find the answer to this? Any other suggestions to where I could go for help?

23,Employer is trying to prevent me from collecting partial unemployment.,1589006510,"Hello! I hope this is the right place.

So, pre-COVID I was working 32-40 hours at a small company. During COVID, I had my hours cut to 25 hours a week, so I applied for partial unemployment (Texas Workforce Commission) because 25 hours a week is not enough to cover my bills and medical bills.

It’s been ALMOST long enough to finally request the actual unemployment (my filing day is Wednesday), but I just got word today that one of the higher ups at the company I work for is going to contest my application, and they’re going to say that I actually worked 39 hours this week and next week on my next check (next week Friday), even though I only worked 25 hours. I’m assuming so that it seems like I’m actually full time to TWC. They also informed me that after this pay period (Friday), they’re putting me back down to part-time at 30 hours, which still is barely under what I can comfortably live on. They’re acting like they’re doing me a favor, but it’s very obvious they’re doing this so I can’t collect partial unemployment. In fact, I’m not the only employee they’re doing this too. In addition, they informed me that I’ll receive extra duties, alongside all the extra duties I’ve received since I’ve been working from home. They let go my coworker a few weeks ago as soon as this started, so I’ve basically picked up the work of two people at almost half the hours.

What the hell can I do? Partial unemployment allows me to reliably live on what I’m making part-time, handle my bills, etc. I was already living check-to-check before, so even a 10-15 hours decrease is a good amount of money in my situation.

24,Father passed away in August.

I checked my credit score a few months back for the first time and i noticed a bunch of closed accounts that he opened under my name including a loan he took out to purchase that property in 1996. My dad was a pretty smart guy and had a lot of power and influence in our town. He got my cousin out of jail and got his charges dropped multiple times by paying the DA a visit. He always found a way to get around roadblocks and he knew people in power that could help him get what he wanted. I called some local lawyers and told them about my discovery. Here is where it gets weird. I had 2 lawyers tell me they are too busy to help me out with this after they found out I was the Son of my Father which they indicated to me they knew personally and gave me their condolences. Another lawyer said they looked at the property and that its not under my name and that it never was which I know is a lie because my dad himself told me already it was under my name and the Sales history shows it was for 20 years (from 1997 until 2017). I think the reason they don't want to get involved might be because there clearly was some fraud and whoever the Notary or Attorney was that validated the transfer might get in trouble over this and they might have some kind of loyal relationship to my mother-in-law which together with my dad had business with pretty much every lawyer in this small town or in this region.   


My dads last testament states that he gives all the authority to my mother in law to do with his possessions as she pleases. The problem is that there is a action class lawsuit going against my dad's estate from some employees he owes $200k to, so things have gotten a lot more complicated. That property should not be part of his estate as he was the one that transferred it and signed the papers not me. Is there anything I can do to get that property back and if possible without getting anyone in trouble for fraud?

28,Wiring Problems in a Rented Home (Texas),1589005984,"Goodmorning! I hope it is well, as mine has not been.

I rent a duplex in Texas with a close friend and roommate. Utilities are NOT included. The renters we shared the other side with moved out two months ago, and it has not been refilled. Just some extra info.

When we first moved in last March (2019), my roommate noticed the lights would flicker occasionally, initially only in the kitchen, and appliances would slow and speed up, especially when the air con started up. However, the problem shortly went away.

In early December, we noticed that the problem had returned somewhat furiously. The kitchen flickered often, and his bedroom, as well. We found that the LED bulbs we were using seemed to take more power than one might have thought, and when replaced with incandescent bulbs, the problem would typically be solved. Still, in early December, we put in a maintenance request.

""The lights have been flickering very badly in the house for the past couple of weeks. The issue originally went away on its own, but has returned far worse than it was the previous time.
Now, sometimes the lights are just dim when they are turned on.
We can even hear our appliances slowing down and speeding up as the lights respectively go dimmer and brighter."" Dec. 7, 2019.

We were told to contact our neighbors, and get together with them to contact the power company, but our neighbors were reclusive, and we were bounced back to our landlord by the power company, so we figured, whatever. We'll deal, right?

We continued living the minimum wage life, replacing LED bulbs with incandescents as the problem slowly spread to other rooms. NBD.

Last night, however, a breaker was tripped. As the AC began, the breaker to the master bedroom was tripped. My roommate and I flip the breaker, go back inside, and everything is fine for a few hours.

AC tries to come on again, now this morning (12.30), and trips the breaker, but when we go outside, we see a glow. At the base of the breaker box, we see something similar to when they show welding in movies. Obviously some kind of short. Luckily, the box is kinda hung open, so my roommate shuts off the main power, and... That's it.

We have electronic records of the original maintenance request, but that is the only documentation I have. I even neglected to take a picture of the short, since we were so busy trying to make sure the house didn't burn down.

I don't know the next course of action. Its been about an hour now. We plan on contacting the landlord, but I don't know what next. Is this somehow our fault?",legaladvice,False,Hylanos,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggadzh/wiring_problems_in_a_rented_home_texas/

I purchased this car in December of 2019. In March, a distracted driver slammed into my car at 40 mph, totalling it.

When I bought the car, they assured that they would obtain the title within 31 days (The law in my state requires this for any sales.) After 60 days and several weeks of expired temp tags, we went to the dealership to check on the progress. They had made no effort at all to obtain the title. And almost refused to give us new temporary tags as ""That's not really how that's supposed to work.""
Then in April we visit again, asking where the title is. They showed us records of contact they had made to obtain it. They made a handful of phone calls and payments over a month after that 60 day meeting. Promised they would have it by the end of the month. May comes, still no title. I call the dealership, and the manager had heard nothing about my situation. The finance manager we spoke with before had either been keeping it under wraps, or they were both lying to cover themselves.

Meanwhile I've been racking up late fees on my auto loan and taking a credit hit because I can't keep paying for a car that 
1) Is no longer drivable/in my possession 
2) Isn't legally mine despite having put thousands into it already.

Yesterday, they finally obtained the title for my car and my insurance can begin to move forward. After their coverage, I am still out $2,500 on a car I was able to use for 2 months.
I paid roughly 18% of the total value of the car as a down payment, and had only made my first monthly payment at the time of the accident.

Do I have any options, here? The dealership sold me a car they didn't have the title to, and made no effort to obtain said title for over 90 days after the purchase, leading to a holdup with my insurance and settling my auto loan.

31,College student sister is collecting unemployment benefits even though she was not working before CA lockdown. Is this fraud?,1589005583,"I live in CA, my sister is home from college since the lockdown started. Usually when she comes home from school, she works as hostess at a local restaurant. Yesterday she told me that she has started receiving $600+ weekly unemployment benefits, explaining that she has an agreement with her employer that when she is in town, she will have \~30 hours/week of work guaranteed. By her logic, if it were not for the pandemic she would be employed and that is why she applied. 

I am concerned that she is not actually eligible and this will come back to bite her. Since she left voluntarily to go to school, doesn't that mean she quit and doesn't qualify? Also, she wouldn't be home if it weren't for the school closing, so she wouldn't be working anyway if it weren't for the pandemic, so she's not actually losing any income. Furthermore, she is entirely financially dependent on our parents and has no living expenses, she plans on saving all the money to buy a car.

When his investigation went on, I was honest and mentioned these things and that he did them several years ago when he was much younger and he hasn't done anything like that recently. He got the job and received his clearance.

About 2 years ago, we discovered he was gay and it wasnt a big deal, till he started acting weird around me,  some of my guy friends, and some of his brothers friends, making them feel uncomfortable (none of them are gay nor I, as we all told him). In fact, he made some moves that made me feel uncomfortable but I avoided physical contact with him for a while after that. He recently asked me if I would accept money for sex and/or a blowjob. He asked me if I would give him sexual favors, and after I rejected him, I told him he shouldn't be doing this and then claimed he has asked other people and even paid someone for sexual favors. I told him he cannot EVER do that again or his career would be at stake and he told he would stop.

Flash forward to a few months ago, I discovered he has been in contact with one of his old hacking buddies ""Dustin"" who doesn't have a job and just plays video games and steals online gift cards for restaurants in the area for free food. Dustin and Alex have been hanging out and stealing these gift cards from the internet and then using them at various places, getting food and drinks for free, and it has been upwards of $10,000 in total. No exact amount but Alex has not bought groceries in over a year, only beer and liquor. 

I gave him a warning that he shouldn't do this stuff but he continues to do it, and now I am very concerned, especially because he has developed an alcoholism problem.

36,(TX) My boss mentors/helps prisoners and I've been asked to place a newspaper ad for one regarding divorce/debt but I'm having trouble finding out if it's even legally worth it,1589004564,"On mobile, so sorry if there are mistakes/formatting issues. 

As the title says, my boss mentors prisoners and helps them out quite a bit if they do get released. One of these guys, located in Texas, recently got out and married a women he had met while he was incarcerated. Unsurprisingly, they're having issues and he now wants a divorce. According to him,  she is running up debt in his name, so he wants to do something that would insure he's not on the hook for that debt. He sent a letter to my boss, who then passed it on to me, to get it placed in their local newspaper (my boss and I are not in Texas). The letter basically states that after March 31st he will not be held liable for any debt incurred under his name. He also states that the divorce is declared April 26th and she has 20 days to respond to the ad or all community property is given to him. 

Now, I'm no lawyer (obviously) but this does not at all seem legally binding to me. I like to do my research on stuff before I go back to my boss with ""this won't work, here's why, and here's what actually needs to be done."" But, I'm having a difficult time with this one. So any help/advice would be very much appreciated. 

Questions/extra info:
1) Last I heard, he has not actually filed for divorce in a court
2) I just received this info a couple days ago, so even if it's legally binding if posted in a newspaper, can it be backdated like that? Can divorce papers be backdated?
3) If it's possible to separate out debt incurred after a certain date, I'm assuming he would have to have some kind of proof that she actually used his information to open the accounts?
4) Would he be completely screwed by trying to navigate this divorce without an attorney?

If it would be helpful for anyone, I can include the letter he wrote to be posted in the paper (with names redacted of course).",legaladvice,False,Kuromi87,/r/legaladvice/comments/gga3q2/tx_my_boss_mentorshelps_prisoners_and_ive_been/

39,(TX) Our roof was part of an insurance scam before we bought the home.,1589003922,"Hi all.

I bought a house in Texas in 2018. We got home owner's insurance before purchasing and our roof is covered under our policy based on their inspection, which did not identify a shingle overlay.

We have had some issues with the roof leaking in the past couple months but we shrugged that off thinking it wasn't anything major. We had the leak repaired and didn't think too much of it at the time.

However, due to my job, I had inside information on a company that redid my roof in 2016. I know the job description (take off old shingles, put on new shingles, and some interior paint work), invoice number, address (matched mine, hey!), cost, previous home owner's name (already knew that but it matched) on the invoice, roofing company's name, etc. It is part of my job to review contracts, so I know for a fact a roofing job of taking off old shingles and putting on new shingles took place in 2016 in the home I live in today. This information is considered confidential and admitting it would affect employment.

When I purchased the home, the inspector stated no issues with the roof (minor wear and tear), but mostly that the gutters needed work. At the time, the paperwork stated the roof was 5 years old. This is not considered old for a roof (had no knowledge of said invoice at the time).

Recently, we were able to hire a contractor for the gutters. The contractor admitted the gutters were bad, then stated our roof had a non-working ventilator (specifically listed in the invoice I saw to create/fix), and had new shingles placed on top of old shingles, thus voiding the warranty of the new shingles and making the roof ""out of code"". Since I (confidentially) saw a contract for the roofing job and the price, I thought this person was trying to pull something on us. He was pushy about having our insurance cover replacing roof and gutters (there was mild hail damage) and we pay the deductible. We explained our roof was only \~5 years old, to which he was confident it was older. Knowing our roof was not the plan, with a contractor this pushy, we sought other contractors.

After a few other calls, it felt like every contractor asked about our roof with no regard to our actual needs. I found a friendly contractor and asked: if these claims were made against your roof, and your mortgage contract said otherwise, what would you do? The sale of the new roof was under the previous owner's name, so I'm not sure I'd be able to contact the roofer. His advice was to contact the real estate agent. Okay.

The second person who inspected our roof for gutter repair mentioned, unprompted, the same concerns about our roof: it's out of code, there were shingles on shingles, this voids the warranty, etc.

I called my realtor, explained the situation, and told her that I confidentially knew that there was a sale on the roof of my house with very specific instructions that have been contradicted by two independent contractors quickly on inspecting my house. I explained I couldn't disclose that info, but that if I could find the name of the roofing agency by honest means, we could pursue accordingly.

The price charged (over double a typical roof of my slant/size) made me think the old owner was being scammed, and I was paying the price.

When my realtor reviewed the files, it said our roof was 5 years old. The old owners lived there 3 years and (when recently asked) claimed there was no work done on the roof during their ownership, yet when they purchased the house, the documentation from prior owners stated it was 7 years old. Meaning when they sold the house, 7 + 3 =10. Why didn't they claim a 10 year old roof? Why did they say it was 5 years old?

I asked my realtor if maybe I had bad info, that the owner had rental properties, and the invoice I saw was for a rental property but billed to that address. She checked, he didn't. My realtor suggested that it was possibly insurance fraud, since the cost was so high, the work contradicted the invoice, and the roof magically got younger during their time living at that address.

I looked at the company's Google reviews, and saw a review from the same name as the previous owner of my house, at the company I know did the roofs, about the time and date that my roof was redone (The review is currently listed as 3 years old) talking about how great the roofers were, and how they double checked everything \*before the insurance agent arrived\*. 

This owner is claiming no roof repairs were done to this house during his ownership which would be from 2015 to 2018, however his review indicates he hired a roofing company in 2016-2017 to do some work on the roof due to insurance issues, was 5 stars satisfied with the result.

How do we proceed? Based on the fact that the previous owner left a review of a roofing company mentioning work was done on his roof, but has told us that no work was performed on the roof while he owned the property, I feel that we have been misled about the state of the property when we purchased it. Should we contact a lawyer to proceed, contact our insurance company, or contact the roofing company? Based on the owners reply so far I don't feel he will be giving honest information so I need some help moving forward so that I can resolve this issue.",legaladvice,False,xthrowaway019238,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg9yqm/tx_our_roof_was_part_of_an_insurance_scam_before/

50,"(Washington) - Public employee, unused comp time not paid",1589002568,"Hey there. Throwaway account because my supervisor knows my regular handle. 

I work for a public agency in Washington State. Our state allows public employees and employers to agree to comp time in lieu of overtime pay. I am an hourly employee and for years I have had an arrangement with multiple supervisors that I would work overtime and accrue comp time that i could use for a variety of reasons. I have come to find out that accrued comp time is supposed to be paid at 1.5x after 26 pay periods of not being used. I did not know this before today.

I have recently been laid off, but I have a job though August. My employer is refusing to pay unused comp time. They say there was nothing in writing. I had a verbal agreement with 3 supervisors and I believe all three would testify to that fact if brought to court as witnesses. They told me that I was free to use the comp time between now and August if I want (impossible to use it all). But I think they know they can't force me to use it. 

In the absence of a written agreement, how screwed am I? It's all tracked on a spreadsheet I maintain. Because we are a public agency, we keep records of EVERYTHING. I'm sure i could find references to the comp time in various emails going back as far as 7 years. 

Even though the agency calls me an exempt employee, I do not meet the salary test or duties test. I am not paid the same every week regardless of what I actually work. If I work 26 hours instead of 40, I get paid for 26 hours. I am not an executive, nor am I administrative, ""professional"" or a ""computer worker.""

I was sleeping, and woke up at 10am, everything was totally fine. And then I went back to sleep. 
I slept 2 more hours, and woke up at around 12:10am. At first everything was totally fine, and 5 minutes later, after going to the bathroom, I had exponentially rising pain in the left testicle. I looked and touched it a little bit, and it felt like there were three testicles, it was very painful.

We tried to make the pain go, and called a cab so that it can drive us to our local hospital. It took time, and we were at the hospital at around 1pm. They took me immediately, looked at me for full 20 seconds, and diagnosed me with a testicle torsion. Then they left me, and told me they couldn't help me, and that I needed to go to another hospital (15-20 km away, without enough money or a car or anything). 

My mother called relatives and friends, but nobody was available. They let us wait the whole time (while I was screaming the whole time, because of the pain), and didn't think about sending an ambulance. My sister called the hospital multiple times, and asked for an ambulance, and that they drive me to the hospital, but they still refused.

I called a friend, and asked if his father could drive me. It was so painful and improvised, I almost got unconscious. It was around 14:25pm at the time we arrived, and my mother didn't really know which papers to give the medical staff (which didn't even ask her). It took 2,5 more hours until I could go into surgery, and the bad news is, they had to amputate my testicle.

Thank God that I have the other one left, but this event left some serious traumatic emotions, which still haven't gone away. I already went to an attorney, and he is currently demanding my documents from the hospital. The hospital only responded to him with denying that I was there (I got multiple witnesses).

60,Thoughts on whether or not my Motion to Dismiss with prejudice will pass considering that the Complaint is bogus?,1589001707,"Location: TX, USA

Plaintiff (who is a complete stranger, might I add) filed a small claims lawsuit against me and a Trust (which I am also unfamiliar with). Their Cause of Action is directed towards the landlord of a property they rented for a few years, and the Plaintiff is essentially seeking a return of several thousand dollars on their deposit and some other rental fees. 

The thing is? I don’t own rental properties, and I most certainly don’t own the property in question. I don’t even know how the Plaintiff got my information. Not to mention, the Citation didn’t have anything that would suggest credence to their claim. It can basically be summed up into, “You’re being sued, the Plaintiff wants money because of some weird rent agreement.” The address of the property wasn’t even listed; I had to contact the Plaintiff to get that information (during a recorded conversation). 

I managed to find public property records, and the only names listed for ownership history were that of the Trust and the previous owners which I’m planning on including that in my Motion to Dismiss. And get this — the Complaint I received wasn’t even the first that she attempted. It was an amended Complaint to change the Defendants from the previous owners to me and the Trust. Like, what? 

Honestly, today kind of sucked. I just want to get this over with. So what do you think? Think I have a shot at getting a Motion to Dismiss with prejudice accepted?

61,"roommate situation got completely out of hand...we moved out, she filed false police reports that we stole her belongings. we have proof that we did not.",1589001465,"Located in Pennsylvania, USA. Thank you for reading 💗

December, 2019: my boyfriend and I had been living with each of our respective parents.  i transferred jobs, moved to his town, and into an apartment with a friend he had met several months prior who was looking for a roommate.  we are all 18+, the original tenant was the only person on the lease. i asked several times to be put on the lease so i could change my mailing address and continue building my own credit. the tenant did not comply.  we split the rent/utilites/wifi three ways under the table. there was no written agreement about any of this. 

late Feb 2020: my boyfriend and the original tenant both lost their jobs. panic ensued. 

early March 2020: original tenant invited another person to sleep on our couch and move in.  my boyfriend and i split the rent 3 ways with this new person to cover for the original tenant who did not have a job or ability to pay their rent, trusting they would pay us back. 

mid march, i went to an inpatient facility for five days to treat suicidal ideation and depression. i had a very bad experience with the staff and left the facility anticipating on getting a lawyer. i came home, to the original tenant asking for my help to evict the 4th person who had been sleeping on the couch. i agreed on the terms that i could be finally put on the lease.  i filed out the application, returned it to the leasing office with a money order processing fee and copies of three of my paystubs.  i changed my mailing address following dropping off the application. 

we kicked out the 4th person before the end of march.  i did not return to work until this week, i have been home self quarantined and receiving catastrophe pay from my job at my normal hourly rate, more than enough to cover my portion of rent.  around this time, the original tenant told us that it was hard to be around us because we are a couple and she is single. at this point we began casually looking for a new place to live. 

notable, this 4th person left several belongings at the apartment and never returned for them: a crockpot, an amazon echo, a set of jeffree star metal straws, a set of silverware, a POP oogie boogie figurine, and a few mugs. 

april: my boyfriend has had a job and is financially secure. we have been buying all of the food for the apartment and welcoming the original tenant to eat with us. i try very hard to be inclusive but she isn’t here much.  she doesn’t help around the house at all and rarely takes proper care of her cat. i have been taking care of him as i take care of my own and have been home for several weeks. she stopped taking quarantine seriously, inviting multiple people to our apartment and ~4 days/nights a week staying somewhere else.  mid april, she sent me a bit more money than her third of the rent, i was assuming for may’s rent and to help out for food (still owed more than this to pay us back for march.) this money sat in my bank account for 4 days, waiting for my boyfriend to get paid and have his third of the rent, and she asked for the money back to turn on her phone. i sent it back and set my portion of rent aside for april. (i would have never been able to pay the rent myself, will explain later.)

may 1st: original tenant started a petty fight with me about my cat, we have never fought before. she escalated everything drastically and disappeared for several days. she brought home a geinea pig that and left him for days, we took care of him. i had no idea how to expect her to behave given the way she fought with me over a petty situation.  i was scared.  my boyfriend and i went through our entire apartment with a 20 minute video detailing our belongings down to the silverware.  

may 2nd: following this, we packed everything nonessential that belonged to us and moved it to his parents. we only left our food, clothes, furniture, and basic necessities to live. we then recorded another video detailing the items that remained in the apartment as well as several pictures.  

may 4th:  first thing monday am i went to the leasing office. i told them that the tenant was not able to pay their portion of rent and that i was not willing to cover the full rent for april. i offered to pay the 50% for april but that i was looking to move out. turns out, they never processed my application because they never had a copy of my photo id. they returned my pen-on-paper application and money order (i have the reciept) and told me i was not financially responsible for the apartment.  the original tenant returned home, and we audio recorded the interaction. she realized we packed most of our things, and was audibly anxious and shaky and trying to figure out what was going on. we talked normally like adults, and then she started getting defensive then upset and then began attacking our relationship and calling us names and told us to get out of her house, giving us a week. i told her we didnt need it. she left for the afternoon, and my boyfriend’s mother came with a truck and helped us gather our furniture and remaining belongings. within 4 hours we were completely finished. she pulled back into the apartment complex as we were bungee cording my boxspring to the top of the truck and left 3 minutes later. we did not interact with her.  i changed my mailing address to my mom’s house. 

following this, she has sent us both harassing texts and demanded various amounts of money. she has threatened us with taking us to court for april’s rent and has been persistently childish while we stand our ground and by our decision to leave.  she insinuated holding on to any of my mail to prove my residency and i told her any mail she recieves without my consent will be considered theft. i get photo copied emails daily from USPS and told her such.  i doubt anything could have been sent there following my change of address, but i said it anyway. 

may 6th: i kept the mailbox key and put an envelope with both of our apartment keys in the mailbox. it is signed and dated by both my boyfriend and i stating the same thing about our mail and that i would return the mailbox key once i verified none of my mail was being left in the mailbox. we also wrote “you may not contact either of us.” i have pictures on my phone of this. 

may 8th: she texted my boyfriend stating that she had been in contact with a lawyer and filed a police report for items that we had “stolen” and that we would be seeing her in court. this was after two warnings that she may not contact us and that further contact would be considered harassment.  the only items i can think that she thinks she might be able to get away with are the items that were left by the 4th temporary roommate that belonged to the apartment (see above for detailed list, we took half of the silverware and everything else as between the two of us as we own 66.6% of those items.) any additional items on that report that she may be claiming is absolutely falsified. she does not know that we have several days worth of recordings and video updates and photos and audio recording of our conversation.  these videos are very detailed and we discuss the entirety of the situation in full honesty.  i openly admit i feared she may try to take or withold our belongings and that is why i was taking them somewhere safe a week prior to her claiming we stole anything of hers.  i left more than enough food for her and generously left cleaning supplies, toiletries and furniture that we purchased for her to be able to take care of herself.  i took everything we rightfully owned and left everything she rightfully owned. we only took the items that the fourth roommate had left simply for the reason that my boyfriend and i were the only two people to use those things; she was rarely there and did nothing to upkeep the apartment and they in no way directly belonged to her, they were left by the 4th person.  i do not know if these are the items she is claiming we stole. in these videos we cite that we inherited them from this fourth roommate, were anticipating taking them, and that they belonged to and were used by us. 

i have yet to get any paperwork about the court date or what she is alleging we stole from her. any of the items we inherited i am more than willing to sacrifice if a court orders me to, but i truly think they should be returned to the 4th roommate. i am already planning on bringing these items with me to court and telling the judge the same thing. 

this person has no idea that we have all of this evidence against her claims. i think she is trying to fuck us over because we chose to not give her money for april’s rent despite her owing us money for march and have been taking care of her financially and emotionally since then. i tried very hard to be civil despite her causing multiple issues in our relationship and being a poor roommate and friend. yes, we had already been looking to move out, but we never made that apparent to her or ever let it affect our friendship or the way we treated her.  i am non confrontational and tried to encourage her to help out around the apartment more, and she told me she couldn’t commit to that because she wasn’t there that often. 

the petty argument led her to get combative and aggressive and rude to the both of us and i have everything saved.  neither of us felt safe and our only choice was to leave or fear she would fuck with our belongings/relationship.  she made demands and told us we needed to stay at my boyfriend’s parents and insulted us and the whole nine yards, so we left the day it all happened because we were already prepared to.

66,My friend bought a car from me. It's been three years and he still hasn't taken it.,1589000951,"This isn't really something I can google, and I really don't know what to do in this situation. In November of 2017, my best friend paid me $800 cash for my car. My husband and I were planning on selling it anyway, and my friend wanted to buy a car for his girlfriend who was learning how to drive. All was well, and my husband and I were visiting friends for Thanksgiving out of state so we agreed that we would transfer the title to them after we got back in town so that his girlfriend would have a little bit more time to get her license. 

Here's where it started to go wrong. A few weeks passed after we got back and every time I brought up him picking up the car my friend or his girlfriend getting her license he avoided my questions. Weeks turned into months, and I confronted him about it and he told me that his HOA only allowed two cars in front of his house (He and girlfriend live with his father) and asked if I could keep it in my driveway while he figured out what to do. I made a mistake and said that was okay, and agreed regularly turned the engine on to make sure the battery/engine would stay in shape. 

That was now almost three years ago. The girlfriend DTILL hasn't gotten her license and every time I bring up the car my friend alludes at us ""owing"" him money for it. A year ago, they were planning on moving into our home but it fell through. The car has been sitting for a very long time and I have since had to replace the battery (out of my pocket) and I'm sure there are going to be other issues with it for sitting for such a long time.

I'm really at a loss on what to do. I realized I made a big mistake, and at this point I'm done having a relationship with them. The only thing left that they have over me is this issue.  I feel like it's unfair to pay back the full $800 because of how much the car has depreciated after years of sitting. I will almost definetely have to spend a chunk of cash to get it back into driving order. I've already spent $200 replacing the battery. 

Any advice on what my legal rights are in this situation? Unfortunately I was an idiot and there was no written contract or anything when I sold it to him and he paid me in cash.

Let me preface this by saying I understand that laws differ between states. The basic laws that I understand is that where this took place, Denton county Texas, the age of consent and age for adult treated trials are both 17. 

My friend, 15 years old, was sexually assaulted by her now ex-boyfriend,17 at the time, for 5 days a week during the 2 months of their relationship. She has just now opened up about it after 6 months and we are in the process of reporting him. Although we doubt it will be a major deal and nothing will most likely come of it, we are wondering what should happen to him when he is reported, what damage will come to his reputation when the report is found true, and what would hypothetically happen if this ended up in a court.

The assaulter has said himself that girls have accused him multiple times of sexual assault, but we don't know who reported this nor do we have evidence of it happening, hence the possible damage and the hypothetical court case if those accusations turn out to be true as well.

We have evidence of the assaulter trying to have friends of the victim persuade her into having sex with the assaulter despite many refusals from the victim.

75,Leaving scene of an accident (ny),1589000376,"I’m kindof freaking out a bit. A week ago i was driving and this lady didn’t use her blinker and slammed on the breaks as she was making a turn, I slammed on the breaks and I still ran into her. It wasn’t that bad, she was in a older beat up car and i saw her like wave her hand at me. Maybe a gesture kindof like what the heck but she seemed fine and I saw her continue to pull into the gas station. 
The problem is, I missed my only turn to get to her and I had to get on the highway, wait a little bit until the next exit to be able to circle around. During these few minutes I panicked because I drive a company vehicle for personal use (there is no detailing on the vehicle indicating a company) and i just went home because I was like 2 minutes from there. 

I stopped home and looked at the damage and there is a decent amount, not super bad, maybe like 1000-1500 max to my bumper / grill. Maybe 15 minutes went by, and I got back up and drove back to see if they were still there or if cops were there. No one was there. I’m not sure if the lady maybe didn’t have Insurance. However I did lose my license plate. when I was driving I did hear some stuff fall from my bumper afterwards so I’m not sure if my plate was one of them but I did not find it at the scene anywhere. 

So right now, I’m slightly panicking because this is technically a hit and run I believe. It’s been over a week and I haven’t heard anything from anyone or police. This occurred in my town too and I’ve driven by many of the town police after the fact, and haven’t been pulled over or anything so it seems like maybe they’re not looking for me? And if they found my plate I’m sure they would’ve called my work by now. This is during the coronavirus so I’m not sure if they’re just super backed up with everything and since this was pretty minor and no one seemed to be injured, that maybe they pushed it away? 

I don’t know but I’m a bit nervous about all of this. I went to the collision shop today to get an estimate and it’s going to cost me a little over $1000 to fix.

83,Mental Hospital Seclusion had water supply turned off. No shower. No toilet. No drinking water.,1588999195,"Unsure how long this went on because I experienced a very strong psychotic episode which I believe may have been possibly induced by the hospital itself but I'd never have any proof anyway.

They refused to turn on my water supply for possibly over 24hrs and on top of that I tested positive for cocaine amphetamine and cannabis which is impossible because I hadn't used amphetamine or cocaine within the 72hr window required to test positive (unless its different for blood? Cocaine is certainly suspicious as I hadn't used it for months)

I was repeatedly told I had taken amphetamines when complaining of kidney pain BP monitor showed 150 which is the highest I've ever seen it and considering I'd spent 4 days on amphetamine high doses of it and only seen 140 I felt it was odd they shrugged it off. I also find being told all my problems were amphetamine is ridiculous because it had been over 4 days since I touched any.

It's worth noting I was experiencing mild auditory hallucinations but after being hospitalised I experienced a severe hallucinatory state. Like it was on a whole nother level. Almost like they induced it. 

Furthermore I was hospitalised for attempting to jump of a bridge not psychosis so it wasn't even the initial issue. Police also ignored any serious allegations and just let the 72hr window pass by (rape allegation) for a DNA test.

I feel like I was taken advantage of in my vulnerable state. I doubt anyone would believe me but they did have full surveillance which I bet they left turned off...

It's honestly left me a little traumatised, terrified and I just want justice not interested in money just want to know if there's any way to force cctv footage to be released should there be any and for once be taken serious and not wrote off as a psychotic individual.

I remember pretty vividly astaff member reading out my mothers suicide note which is downright abuse since my mother is alive and kicking. I believe police were called but possibly compliant.

84,Furloughed in America,1588998883,"Hi All,

I have a bit of a complicated scenario I’m looking for legal advice. I worked for a tech company for 7 years. I was the Marketing Manager for at least 3 years. My company hired a Marketing Director (my boss) two years ago. They then hired a content writer less than a year ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit I received an email from my COO, who also cc’d my Marketing Director, that my position had been furloughed. My Marketing Director called me within 30 minutes letting me know she had no idea I was being furloughed. She said she would write a letter of recommendation for me and that I should probably start looking for a new role at a new company. 

Fast forward five weeks later. I’ve emailed my boss (Marketing Director) three times now to follow up on her reference letter offer. She has not responded. I heard from a colleague she put in her resignation notice and today was her last day. I went on LinkedIn and saw our content writer changed her title (was promoted) to Marketing Communications Manager. 

I still have no update from my boss, COO, or CEO on the status of my employment. The now Marketing Manager has been given all my responsibilities (I know this as I keep in touch with current employees). 

My question(s):

1. What do you recommend I do in my position as far as company communication?

2. Is there any legality giving someone else within the company my role while they furloughed me?

My public defender told me I needed to plead guilty to both charges since they were from the same incident but the assault charge was dismissed in court and then I had it expunged. I was convicted of trespassing and after a year I had the charge expunged as well. 

My questions are: Should I answer yes to both questions or just the second? And - how should I go about explaining this in the ""explanation"" section?",legaladvice,False,tac0pelle,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg8bfy/oh_how_do_i_explain_this_conviction_on/
2,SJW Neighbor Blackmailing Me Over Private Conversation,1588996496,"Hi,

I've been living through a very stressful situation and I don't know what to do. 

A week ago I was having some beers with a few friends over zoom in the privacy of my bedroom. The conversation became off color and we made jokes that could be considered racist or sexist. I also made a joke about my Indian boss. The next morning I get a knock on my door and my next door neighbor is smiling and tells me that she ""got me"". She then proceeds to show me that she recorded my private conversation that I had the night prior in my room standing outside my window.

She is threatening to contact my employer and post the conversation online unless I donate a substantial amount of money to a few charity groups and do some volunteer work.

9,CSPA Age-Out Scenario with Coronavirus,1588995135,"Hey,

Here from the Immigration subreddit since I've been given more context from my mom and seen paperwork and read into everything I can on the internet and PDFs. I'm like 17 and haven't taken AP Gov yet, I just realized how confusing all of this can be. Lawyers out there, I appreciate you.

My mom, a US Citizen at the time, applied for her sister (from **India ,F4**) , and thereby her sister's family (of 1 spouse, two children), given the priority date of late Jul. 2008. At the time the elder sister was almost 11 years old. The federal case-online site said it was received on Feb 2010. My mom's lawyer said hopefully they'll be okay, but my mom doesn't contact her much, so my cousin and I called each other last night and figured we could look into it ourselves.

It took two years for the petition to reach and be approved by the USGov, and as of now it still hasn't been approved.

My cousin, the elder sister, has been **aged out according to the CSPA age calculator**, she's 21 years old and had the 2 year wait period subtracted to be 19, but her case is predicted to be in done in September 2024, so she'd have no chance I think.

Question's I have from this scenario are

1. Is the CSPA age calculator judging the predicted date based on the current work period they have? (I think they did about 2 weeks of visas for F4, between the April and May bulletin?)
2. Will **Coronavirus** extend the processing times/priority dates/whatever it's called? And if they do, will this help to prevent her age out?
3. Processing times will surely speed up post-pandemic, correct?
4. Once she ages out, is it better for her to apply for- **a student visa** (she's going to graduate from college with a Bachelors at 23, could do Masters in the US and attempt to gain permanent residency from Greencard lottery from there. I worry about her showing something called **Intent-To-Stay?** Read about it while looking at student visas, but they said visas can be revoked if you try and permanently immigrate.)- **her mother/father to apply for her while she stays in India alone** (probably doing her Masters there while she waits- **her brother to apply** (which I don't think would be a good idea since F4 is least prioritized?)- **an employment visa** with her Bachelors's, somehow gaining permanent residency from that point?
5. Just a general question, but why does CSPA subtract the approval-waiting time, which in our case was 2 years, and not the waiting period for the interview (post approval, 8 years for us?). No one probably knows a reason but I was just surprised to see only 2 years get subtracted since we and many others have probably waited many, many years.

I'm so sorry for so many questions, I'm just trying to figure something out and have been all day, before she wakes up and reads all the articles and screenshots of charts and dates I've sent her. Thank you so much for your help, it's greatly appreciated!

10,Auto Insurance Refusing to pay,1588995065,"I was involved in a (seemingly) relatively minor accident some time ago. The drivers insurance approved and was paying everything. Then on the day of pickup, it was realized that the driver would be maxing out his policy (15k) once the rental costs had been added in. At that point they issued no more payments and the claim was passed over to my insurance who would be covering the balance (sans my deductible) and then pursuing the driver to recoup said deductible. After reviewing the paperwork my insurance decided they weren't going to pay for certain items totaling \~5500 (disputing that they were necessary, but were required to complete the repairs), and have seemingly finalized the claim.

  
The car is still at the repair shop, ready to go for the past week, and won't be released until the balance is paid. Do I pay the balance then pursue small-claims or wait and continue to pressure my insurance to pay the balance, minus the deductible? And this doesn't even include re-application of ceramic coating and PPF for the repaired part of the vehicle, or recouping diminished value.

12,Mom is taking care of my Grandma and using her money...my uncles are threatening to sue and I am worried for my Mom,1588994821,"First time poster. 

My grandma has three children. My mom and my two uncles. My grandparents lived across the country, but after my grandpa died, the uncles stopped seeing or helping my grandma. My mom eventually moved my grandma to our state and had her live in a very very expensive retirement community. 

 My grandma started to have worse and worse dementia and a few months ago my mom and Grandma had to move in together. I am visiting and my grandma needs constant care. She cannot turn the stove on by herself and refuses to shower. She refuses to have any help come in so my mom is her personal chef, nurse and everything. My mom has to be at the house most of the day and can't really have a full time job unless they paid someone else to nurse my grandma, but grandma refuses. 

My mom has power of attorney and is using my grandma's money to pay the rent, buy groceries and gives herself some money from my Grandma's saving. She also has been buying extra things for the house and things for herself like clothes, but she has purchased a few extensive items like a new computer using my grandma's money.

 My grandma knows about the rent and the food, but she always complains that she is paying all the rent (although we saved her over $1,200 by moving her from the living center to this much bigger and better house). On top of that, if my grandma has less then 130,000 in her bank account, she qualifies for some kind of veterans assistance so my mom has been slowly taking money out of her account so she can get help when the time comes to need more help. Otherwise, that money would go away pretty fast if she had to pay for constant nurses and care.

My uncle threatened to call the police when they were moving in together and they think my Mom is being abusive toward her and spending all her money and taking advantage of her. They refuse to believe my grandma has any problems and have no appreciation that my mom dropped everything to care for my grandma all day. Her will is split three ways between the two uncles and my mom. 

I have talked to my mom about having a written agreement that grandma pays her a certain amount per/month to have it all in writing, but my grandma refuses to admit she needs help or there is anything wrong with her or that my mom even helps her with anything. When my uncles calls, she complains about how badly she is being treated and that she wants to leave. They never visit her or even call her and have no interests in ever taking care of her. 

When she dies, can my uncles sue my mom for the money she is using  and how can she protect herself from that.",legaladvice,False,backpack_of_wrists,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg7vya/mom_is_taking_care_of_my_grandma_and_using_her/

19,Can I include short quotes (less than 15 words) from authors &amp; business leaders in my eCommerce product (journal)?,1588993839," 

Hi LegalAdvice community,

Looking to include some quotes from authors and business leaders in my product (journal).

I've already done a bit of research, but the info I found are mostly around quoting movies/songs/anime on T-shirts &amp; mugs, hence I'd like to ask more specifically. (I'm based in Australia.)

I do plan to attribute the authors either way, but because I'm going to include at least 90-100 quotes (3,4 quotes from different authors), it could take me forever to go through the process asking for permission. I just want to ship an MVP by the end of this month, and start getting some income during this period. (No job at the moment.)

**Will I be at the risk of infringement if:**

* Half of the quotes in the journal are going to be my original thoughts, but the other half are from these authors and business leaders (as their quotes have had a positive impact on my life so I want to include them in my product).
* Each quote will be fewer than 15 words, mostly found from their email newsletters or noted down when from their podcasts. Some quotes will be from their books but are still fewer than 15 words. Does this mean the quote is too short to be protected by copyright and is open for public use?
* The quotes aren't in public domain. They're from people such as Seth Godin and Ryan Holiday who are still well and alive, or lesser-known leaders from the advertising industry who could be harder to contact.
* I'd also like to include some URLs to interesting YouTube videos (e.g. TED Talks, or insightful interviews). I've read it's okay but want to be sure.
* Yes, the journal is to sell as an eCommerce product, for profit.

**What I know so far:**

* ""Generally speaking, short phrases and titles cannot be copyrighted, especially if there is only a limited number of ways you could express the same idea/concept.""
* It's okay to quote a book title (not its content), a fact, or a very short phrase (but there's no specific details on the length).
* This is a copyright-related question, not trademark-related.
* I'm not quoting a song lyric, nor poem, which means less likely to have copyright issues. (Doesn't mean it's okay to use it though if it's not the right thing to do...)
* I'm not using more than a few sentences length from a book, so my quotes shouldn't impact the value of the original work. But for email newsletters and podcasts, I'm not sure?
* If anything, my journal is raising awareness towards the authors I admire, rather than plagiarising their work as I'm going to attribute them...?

Thanks!

20,"[MD] Police shot at me, cuffed me, raided my house, damaged my property, and now the police department is trying to frame me as the bad guy. Legally, Is there anything I can do?",1588993820,"Baltimore, Maryland. 4 PM.

Please buckle up for a long story.
TL;DR at the bottom of the post.
21 M

Awhile ago, maybe two/three weeks ago, I was sitting on my porch at the home my mother owns.
Me, (21 M,) my sibling, (21 M) and a friend of ours, (18 M) sat with us. 
We all say together on the property, not doing anything illegal. Keeping to ourselves. A few minutes later, our friend's younger brother (16 M) comes on the property uninvited, but continued to sit with us. He got into an altercation with one of our neighbors (who harassed him) and pulled out a fake gun. At the time, I had no idea this happened, as when it did occur he was off the property and I wasn't paying attention (and oh boy I wish I was.)
The friend's brother comes back to sit with us and has the gun (BB gun) hidden under his shirt, we didn't notice it. This is where everything went wrong. 

A few minutes later, two police officers fires their guns towards me, my brother, and friend, three innocent bystanders. They fired 6 different times, 6 chances to kill me or my friend and brother. Unfortunately, they struck my friend's little brother in the arm. We ran into my house because we didn't want to be killed. My friend's brother is bleeding badly, and the police scream at us to come outside and if we moved they would kill us. Shaking with fear, me, my brother and our friend stand outside with our hands up. They move in with their guns drawn, focused on us. They cuff me and my brother, but not our friend, Oddly enough. Our friend's brother, with a bullet wound in his arm runs into our house and won't come back down. My mother, (who at the time was in her room) came downstairs scared and confused. She began recording as I was getting cuffed. Our friend's brother wouldn't leave our house. ""They're gonna shoot me again"" ""they're gonna kill me!"" He screamed from upstairs, hiding behind my family members. He is then pushed out of the house by my other brother. He is then cuffed. By time my friend's brother is pushed outside, there's at least 15 police officers surrounding my house. 

Fast forward a few minutes, they announced that ""Everyone who is indoors needs to come out NOW!"" At the time, my younger family (nieces and nephew: aged 2, 5, 8,) was staying the night and heard all the screaming and gunshots, and hid screaming and crying. They're brought out the house and is being taken to the car by a family member to calm their nerves. The younger brother is now taken care of, and is no longer bleeding as bad. They sit us down to get our statements and to figure everything out. We're still cuffed. This same thing goes on for 4 long ours of sitting cuffed on an old stool. Finally, they take us down to the station to ask us even MORE questions. Whilst we were at the station, they sent an entire K9 unit and got a search warrant to enter my house. Trying to find guns, drugs, anything to build a sturdy case. Two hours later I'm returned home and my house has bullet holes in it. At least two or three.

As to why the police shot at us without a warning, I'll tell you. She told the police chief ""I'm having problems at home,"" which is why she fired without warning.

My entire family was shaken up, we couldn't sleep for days. We were all given unnecessary PTSD all because of the carelessness of two police officers. I was almost killed for a situation that had nothing to do with me. Can I sue? Can my family sue as well?

I often see them posted with tag lines such as “know your 4th amendment rights” or “come back with a warrant.” 

But, say in a situation in which this bag is easily seen by a police officer (in a state where weed is illegal such as Missouri) and they know the bag itself is meant for carrying weed, can they search it? I’m not familiar with laws concerning the 4th amendment and I’m unsure of how probable cause plays into unreasonable searches and seizures. Can anyone explain?

25,"Saw a promotion for Subway Pick Up orders due to COVID-19: Buy one get one free via pick up orders online. Placed a pick up order online, went to store, was told people already took my food? Come back home with receipt for my order, but no food and negative money? Store owner argues I am scamming?",1588993411,"Hello and good day, this is a throw away account since I am a very private person and have anxiety related to privacy due to being agoraphobic


For context, I have recorded the phone conversation between myself and the Subway store owner (although I cannot post it here at /r/legaladvice).  I recorded the conversation because I realized after 7 minutes of talking to him about not receiving our food for pick up he was becoming more hostile, accusatory, and yelling at me.

When I posted this originally my own youtube channel and not a throw away youtube channel, I shared this with Subway corporate as well as him.


He then [posted this as a comment which he later then deleted](https://i.imgur.com/tpqRmWV.png) but I still have it in my youtube notifications of what he posted regardless of him deleting it, because that message was redirected to me from the youtube servers where the message is still saved



He has accused me of:

1)  A liar

2)  A thief

3)  Organized Crime

4)  Technologically unaware

Also the most offensive thing he suggested was that my mom should go to the Subway store and order in person (even though she has a cochlear implant and can't hear that well doesn't understand English) for a longer duration than necessary during COVID-19 in new york city, the largest city effected in the USA.


I do not take this lightly at all, my father passed away in January, 5 months ago it will be in 10 days from today. And I do not appreciate having to think about any scenario of which the few of the family I have left will pass away because a SUBWAY STORE OWNER DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO EFFECTIVELY RUN A SUBWAY IN 2020 WHEN ONLINE ORDERING IS A COMMON THING.

All of which I find offensive, over $17.69.  Why did they give my mom a receipt for the food but no food?  If other people took my order like they suggested, then why didn't they give them the receipt?  [Why is there a receipt left to give to my mom?](https://i.imgur.com/d0k7eTD.jpg)


My phone number is on the receipt, why they call it to make sure whoever was picking up my order was me by simply calling?

There is a unique order confirmation #


Why did they not double check with the persons picking up the order this UNIQUE confirmation #?  Is this not the purpose of the UNIQUE order confirmation number?

Only the legitimate customer can know it, instead the employees just assumed the first person to walk through the door was there to pick up my order instead and asked if they were me.



This is the only way I can think of what happened, happened if what the Subway store owner was saying is true or rather his employees are saying is true because the store owner had told me over the phone he was not present at the subway store.  Instead when I called him, he simply called the Subway store and asked the employees what happened and believed it without questioning at all and then defaulting to accuse me.

I saw a promotion from Subway for pick up orders due to COVID-19 and to practice safe social distancing to lessen time spent in the physical store.


The promotion was exclusive to online / pick up orders placed online at the subway.com website:


[""DIGITAL EXCLUSIVE BUY ONE GET ONE FREE ONLY IN THE APP OR ONLINE""](https://i.imgur.com/PYOegsE.png)


I don't order subway often, 4 times total since the beginning of this year and since I have been agoraphobic -2004.

I used to enjoy Subway a lot more as a teenager, there was one near my dad's office 17 or so years ago and I would spend a lot of time at my dad's office around then and we would have a tradition getting subway for lunch together if we were lazy since it was close by.


But either my taste for Subway since I was a teenager has changed or the sandwiches have.

My dad passed away back in the middle of January of this year, 4 months ago and some days. [A few months later in March I would order Subway 3 different times](https://i.imgur.com/CZKWGLD.png), all the same kind of order, [at least 1 meatball and 1 chicken teriyaki since we shared half a footlong of those and 1 other variety of sandwich](https://i.imgur.com/1tP6Teg.png) to see what's new at subway for pick up online I guess to help me relive a moment with my dad from years ago.


It's just not as good as I remember, but I figured since all the restaurants that I frequent near me are mostly closed or I am bored of what is left available I thought I'd get subway since it is cheap considering my order was only $17.69 which is a lot cheaper than [what I normally spend on delivery/take out meals (usually anywhere from $30-$100)](https://imgur.com/a/cOKRvrr) and thought it might bring back some momentary nostalgia.


[This order history is from delivery.com where I have never had a problem over years and this is only half my orders since I also order from Seamless / Grubhub for more variety of food since there restaurants on Seamless / Grubhub that are no available on delivery.com](https://imgur.com/a/cOKRvrr)


If you notice throughout my history I used to buy cigarettes delivered to my door through their delivery service, the mark up was incredibly high, [$18.95 a pack and would order about 7 packs a time also having to pay a 15% delivery tip and then tax](https://i.imgur.com/ezxYfyq.png) 


But that was the price I was paying since I am an agoraphobic and having anxiety with my privacy and leaving my apartment



The most infuriating thing about all of this is that his Subway store is being leased by the apartment building I live in.  And my family is the home owner of our apartment, BUT I AM PAYING THE MORTGAGE AND MAINTENANCE FEES.


So I am essentially chipping money for the maintenance fees to help maintain his Subway store.


I feel very bad and humiliated


The whole reason why I do not go outside is because I used to face a lot of judgement and I felt ashamed.


I remember one of the few days I was leaving my apartment building and the ""doorman"" / concierge did not know who I was nor did I know her.  I was getting off the elevator and entering the lobby where my own concierge looked at me and said, ""wow you're the fattest chink I ever saw""  I was leaving the apartment building at the time to collect a treadmill I was collecting from the delivery truck parked outside.  I remember feeling very unsafe even just leaving outside my apartment door after that.


The only few times I have ever left my apartment since 2004 was to go to a dentist, two times and attending my father's funeral and burial service.  I am sure there are other few moments, but there are spans of 1-4 years I never leave at all.


I don't know anyone locally, I don't have any friends locally, how am I supposed to arrange people to come steal food from a Subway store?


The store owner is accusing me of being a liar, a thief, organizing some sort of crime between myself and others, when in reality I do not harm anyone simply based on the fact I don't even have access to anyone.


It really hurts me because now I feel even less safer at home, if I cannot feel safe at home then where can I feel safe?


I am being shamed, labeled a criminal, liar, thief, scammer and I did nothing without any possibility to do anything he is saying.


I have spent the past 16 years avoiding any reason why anyone should judge me


That day I was offering to give him my business which if continued he could make a lot of repeat business off me since pretty much one of the few luxuries I get experience in life as an agoraphobic is ordering food, and I order a lot.

But instead that day I was left negative money and no food
How is ANY of that fair?


I feel ashamed for having to defend myself by exposing myself with my secret I keep from anyone I do know who is not my family (online friends, well online friend) when all I did was order sandwiches that were promoted to use the Online order pick up service.


I even called corporate and have a phone conversation with them,  they have not helped me at all since.  Thinking about this keeps me up at night and even prevents me from fulfilling my work and I am very busy the next two months.

27,I'm officially a criminal...,1588993120,"I am worried I will be prosecuted for credit card fraud...

I was recently laid off from my job and left with no money to pay my bills. I filled for unemployment but I didn't have time to wait on it to process, so I needed money in order to not lose my apartment and car, etc...

I was desperate for a way to pay my bills, so I scavenged through all of my accounts, looking to scrape together whatever I could to make ends meet....

I ended up looking at PayPal, and I noticed I had a credit card saved under my payment methods. I was almost certain I had closed down all of my credit cards a long time ago, but I did not want to be homeless and with out a car, so I withdrew $1,500 from my PayPal account using that saved credit card. Assuming, I would be billed in the future through the mail or some type of debt collection agency. I didn't think it through because I just wanted to know I would have a place to sleep at night. Anyway, all was well until my Aunt called me and told me about how her card had been stolen and charged for $1,500. My heart dropped. I explained to her that it must have been me and I was under the impression that it was an old card if mine because I don't remember her ever giving me her information to purchase anything, she must have at some point but it would have been years ago...

She explained to me that she was credited for the amount that was charged, but worried about me getting in trouble for it.

I believe that the best thing I could do would be to tell her to call the card company and explain that it was an accident, and then I should just pay her back. But I have no source of income until my unemployment is processed. 


What will happen to me if I don't take action? 

Will the card company pursue me? If so, how will they go about it? Will I get a letter in the mail? Will the police come to my door? Will I be alright for a few weeks and then all of the sudden find myself behind bars?

ex raped, abused, manipulated me, damaged my property, stalked me, threatened to steal our daughter, gave away my dog, and is abusive to his little sister too, is irresponsible and reckless with our daughter when given the chance. Recently groped me after we broke up. I never reported him because I was dumb and cared too much. We have a 6 month old daughter together, and he's not on the birth certificate, my daughter has my last name, paternity hasn't been established but I know for a fact he's the dad. He helps with nothing other than 2 outfits, 3 boxes of diapers, and a cheap toy or two. Is it worth pursuing child support? Is there a way to keep him from my daughter or keep him from getting any sort of custodial rights? Is there a legal way I can keep him from visiting whatsoever? He's been visiting once or twice a month, for an hour or so. He has to be supervised by my family or he tries to be manipulative, make me cry, or get in my pants. He also is reckless with holding our daughter wrong 

&lt;This parts mainly for venting and more details&gt; long version: Soooo my dumb ass made the mistake of dating an abusive and very manipulative douche. This guy has beaten my dog (extra cruel bc he knew he was a rescue, my dog had been a bait dog prior to us having him) and gave him away to someone hours away, who then took him a few states over and abandoned him at a pound. My car was broken down at the time and I couldn't rescue my dog, and it still haunts me to not know what happened to him. He has been known to throw his little sister off him while yelling expletives like ""fuck off!"" While playing video games, he cracked my windshield punching it, would pick me up drunk from bars after we broke up to take advantage of me and then verbally abuse me and ditch me on the side of the road, miles from my car in winter at 2am without my phone or jacket, then come back acting nice to lure me back in after leaving me for 20 minutes or so, just to continue verbally abusing me. He would drive past my house multiple times a night every night most of one year and still occasionally did from time to time after he stopped doing it regularly. He also broke into my friend's house while we were broken up to ""make sure I wasn't having sex"" and followed me out to make sure I left, then followed my car no matter where I drove or how I tried to lose him. He lied to coworkers, friends, family, etc that I was cheating and abusive, so that they'd pity him and take his side when I broke up with him. everything was always my fault, he never could accept responsibility. He also used up all my money back in 2016. He used me to cheat on his new girlfriends. He got me pregnant and wanted to make things work and my dumb ass believed when he said he'd get better. He then cheated on me while I was pregnant, made threats to kidnap my kid, and then when he found out I wasn't going to put him on the birth certificate or give his last name, he broke up with me and left me for the other girl, a few days after birth. He didn't show up to the hospital until i was close to giving birth, and he came cross faded as hell, smelling like he had a sex marathon with the new girl. He even tried to bring her in to watch me give birth. This isn't everything he did, but point is he's a terrible abusive person, and I know he'd treat my daughter poorly if given the chance to be alone with her. He already let her head flop and dangle as a newborn, no matter how many times he was corrected by nurses even, he would torture my baby by waking her up the moment she fell asleep, over and over again, until she was screaming crying, just so he could take selfies with her, etc. I've seen how neglectful him and his parents were with his baby sister, so him dumping my baby on them, or them supervising is not much of an improvement.",legaladvice,False,slowfadinglight,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg7caf/abusive_exbd_is_it_worth_trying_for_child_support/

NURSE-A nurse who lives in my household who has been furloughed. - has a husband with heart issues.

BABY - Premature Synagis baby who died from underlying conditions and was later tested positive for Covid-19

BOSS- Nurse's Boss.

FRIEND- Nurse's friend

&amp;#x200B;

Nurse gives synagis (i think i spelled that right) to a child. Nurse must pick up and weigh premature baby with underlying conditions, and then administer shot.

Baby dies from other conditions and is tested positive for Covid-19, unbeknownst to Nurse &amp; family.

Nurse is furloughed

Friend informs Nurse that Baby has been tested positive for Covid-19 and that Friend was instructed by Boss not to tell Nurse.

Months later, Nurse has not been informed.

According to Friend:

1) Friend could get in serious trouble for telling Nurse what she told her

2) Boss stated that the reason for not telling Nurse is that she is 'at low risk' even though she is required to hold, weigh, and administer shot to Baby, who cries, and snots. Also, a member of Nurse's household has heart conditions and recently had 5-bypass open heart surgery.

53,"Help needed, child abuse case--MICHIGAN, kent county",1588990692,"So I have just completed binding arbitration with my ex after a 2.5 year custody battle.  The ex was accused by my very young child of sexual abuse.  Although CPS substantiated the claim, and he was registered as a level one offender with the state, we ultimately ended up with 50/50 Custody.  (He was able to get removed as a level one offender but the claim remains substantiated)

During arbitration our Arbitrator threw out all my child's therapist's testimony including a 4 hour deposition, saying she was not 'vetted"".  The GAL on the case committed perjury on the stand, and I can prove it.  He claims he attempted to contact a person important to the case (my therapist) and that the therapist refused to talk to him.  This is patently untrue, and my therapist will sign an affidavit confirming this.  I believe my ex, who is quite wealthy, bribed him.  

The arbitrator also threw out the child porn found on my ex's computer as ""noncontributory"".  The feds were called regarding this porn and could not prosecute as they claimed there were not enough images and no proof that he had distributed them.  The images are alarming, showing a clearly preteen person begin penetrated by an adult male.

 Ex's psych report stated it was ""alarming"" that his connection to the children was so low, and that he was likely actively abusing drugs and alcohol.  My psych report said that I am anxious and have some difficulty coping alone but clearly love my children and endeavor to be a good mother, no signs of mental illness.  The GAL put in his report that he believes me to be mentally ill.  Every person who has read the GAL report says it is the worst/most biased report they have ever read.  

The GAL wrote that he believes I coached the child ""despite a lack of evidence"", and the worst part is, my child retracted her claim about 18 months after initially happening.  Her exact statement was :  ""Please tell everyone I made it up, I miss my Daddy"".   This was after 18 months of her begging me to call the police if he showed up at our house. I did not try to hide her retraction, I immediately reported it to everyone involved.  

We started 50/50 custody several months ago, and some concerning things have happened:  My children came home after an extended weekend with him saying they ""couldn't pee"" because daddy had spanked them so badly up north ""front and back"".  I called my attorney, and he advised me to take the kids to urgent care, who said the same story to the doctor, who reported the story to CPS.  CPS did not perform a forensic interview for over 10 days due to thanksgiving holiday, and they did not substantiate the claim because the kids did not reveal anything in the forensic interview, and although both kids were red and irritated on exam , "" no definitive physical evidence"".

Today, my youngest, who has been wetting her pants again for the past week again after being fully potty trained, returned from her father's.  She and my oldest are complaining of pain when peeing again, and my youngest claims it is due to daddy hurting her again.  My oldest became hysterical and said ""If you report this Daddy will die in Jail"".  I have never believed her retraction, and her father is a psychopath.   Here is the big problem:  Ex is suing me after the binding arbitration for full custody on the basis of ""parental alienation"" .  He has hired allegedly the best attorney in the state (his 5th) . 

My father believes he probably did hurt my youngest, as a set up to make me take the kids to the Dr again and have a report made, which he will probably beat again, and then I will lose the pending lawsuit and my children to a crazy, abusive person.   I feel trapped, I am fighting a multimillionaire with nothing but time on his hands and a vicious personality, I feel as if any move I make right now is the wrong one.  I'm not even sure I trust my own attorney who I have been with and am very close with for 2.5 years.  I am going to be bankrupted by this, I can't afford to keep fighting him, and I can not believe no one will advocate for my children.  I really, really need help.

Any advice?

54,"Sold a home in Oregon, is there any way to reverse the sale if I wasn’t mentally fit at the time?",1588990688,"I want to preemptively apologizing for my actions in the following story. I made several really shorty life choices after my fiancé died and I was a mess. I know this is a long shot but here it goes.  Long story:
It’s been almost a year since I signed papers to sell my home in Oregon. I was in foreclosure and approaching the cutoff date and desperately trying to fix up my house to sell it. 
I had a realtor put it on the market. The house was put on the market for about $330,000. I only owed $90,000. 
Again I was desperate because the impending foreclosure. I was drinking heavily and in a very very bad mental state. 
Preemptive apologies for my following actions:
I found a room to rent on Craigslist while planning to sell. I get raped there while drunk. 
I leave the house and get a dui. 
I go to the sobering center for the night, get picked up by the realtor’s worker and he takes me to sign the papers. She tells me then she could only get $120,000. And by now we wouldn’t have time to stall foreclosure (I had done this previously with the owner- it was a private mortgage). 
So I was in withdrawals from being at the sobering center and detoxing, so I immediately had to get alcohol into my system so I could even sign the papers. 
I don’t remember anything about it really. I agreed to half of what she originally put it on the market for. She said I’d loose it otherwise and it was the best she could do. 
I stayed drunk for a few days while waiting to get into a rehab. Yes, I was that physically dependent I was in danger of DT’s if I didn’t drink. 
So now, clean and sober for many months- and this story came up and I was told that because I shouldn’t have signed because of my mental state- essentially mentally unfit at the time. 
I can show in documents the date of arrest and signing were within 18 hours. 
Again, I know it’s a long shot, but sober me hates everything that happened and I’m just praying there is anything I can do. I lost my moms retirement money and my life savings over this situation.

I am in Alameda county, California, USA.

My friend and I signed a new lease at a condo a few days ago.

A few days later, our building caught fire (neighboring unit at fault), then the hallway flooded, leading to a large chunk of our floor of the building flooding. I should add that we are on the 3rd floor of a 3 story building. The water ended up flooding our dwelling, we have laminate/hardwood and carpeting, which were ruined.

None of us were harmed and none of our possessions were permanently damaged fortunately, but the dwelling is uninhabitable currently due to the water/fire damage and soot. Due to Covid, I was already working remote from a relative's house so I wasn't present when this incident occurred. My roommate is staying with some friends for the moment after the incident happened

We got some basics out of the way with our landlord, as we are not at fault in any way, and since this happened at the beginning of the month, they offered not to charge rent, and it will not affect our deposit. However, the place is uninhabitable, it reeks of smoke/soot smell, and the carpet is ruined. The cleaning up crew that came by also reported that while we can come/go as needed, we cannot stay there either until it is livable again, my understanding is that they will fix up the main section, uncertain for our dwelling though.

We were also informed that they are waiting on the insurance/adjuster folks to make their report on the incident as far as damages and reimbursement is concerned for the building.

Our landlord was saying that if the place can't be fixed quickly, there was talk of breaking our lease so we can move elsewhere. The problem is, we would prefer NOT to move if possible as the location is otherwise solid for us, and we have a good relationship with the landlord.

We do not have any sort of renters insurance on our end either. I believe the landlord/building management both have the respective types of insurance for the building and individual condo however.

Apologies if I missed any details that might be important.

My questions are:

* Can our landlord just break our lease like that? 
* Do we have any recourse requiring them to find temporary housing in the meantime or anything of that nature?
* What sort of tenant rights are available to us, or rather, where can we look further into these?
* Obviously moving while stay-at-home order is in effect adds another layer of complexity to the issue, as a result of it, are there any further protections as a result of it?",legaladvice,False,Flaky_Wait,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg6pg1/signed_new_lease_for_condo_building_caught_fire/

77,I’m not saying she’s a gold digger but...,1588989053,"Hey all, 

Backstory: 
My dad met and fell in love with this “amazing” woman. She rides motorcycles like him (a hot pink one), loves to camp, fish, travel across the US on a motorcycle, etc. So of course, he fell head over heels blindly and madly in love. From the very beginning, I saw it, we all saw it—she was a bit of a “vindictive, controlling person” (words from my aunt and dads sister) who was so good at putting on a fake smile and being overly “kind.” My grandmother (dads mother) calls her my “evil stepmother.” Because she is. She is 10 or so years older than me (I’m 21) and my dad is nearly 50 and he does well for himself. We all saw the motive behind her schemes ($$), but he did not. She even tried getting my name off his will by sabotaging my relationship with my father. She would give me alcohol in high school and then tell my dad I stole it from her, or tried saying I was pregnant etc. Anything to make my father believe I was a ringleader of evil. 

Fast forward to 4 years later. They have a child that she begged to have because my dad refused in the beginning because of his age. Now, my little sister is 3 (just turned 3 in April). Today, my father was making my sister lunch and out of nowhere the cops knock on the door. My step mother lets them in and the cops escalate to cornering my father while my step mother takes clothes, my sister, and the dog. She leaves and the cops stay behind until she is out of sight, then they leave with a “sorry the rug just got swept from underneath you.”  

She is claiming my father is abusive and an alcoholic. My father has never once been abusive, I have been around him my entire life. My sister and I adore him. I see him bend over backwards for this woman on a constant basis (I don’t even want to get into what he does for her). My father is not an alcoholic but I can see why she is saying he is (leverage). When we ask “how is he abusive?” She says “he’s been drinking again.” As if he is some major alcoholic. 

Oh yeah, when the cops showed up they also said that she reported my dad is “suicidal.” That was seriously pulled from left field. This is not true at all. I was thinking she said that so cops would keep an eye on him. 

My dad also refuses to get a lawyer and he is deliberately saying “I will do whatever she wants, she is my family, I want her back.” He is so lost in love he can’t see clearly enough here to see he needs to defend himself legally. I am worried my step mother will try getting full custody and obviously she is already trying to take everything. 

My questions: 

Does she have any legal standing? 

Is it legal for her to take their child without telling my father the whereabouts of his own child? He can’t even talk to my sister. He has no idea where they went. 

Can she create an entire story out of nowhere and press charges based in her fables? She is literally making this all up and has NO PROOF. 

Can she get in trouble for lying If we have proof she is lying to authorities? 

Is there any hope for my father is he refuses to fight back? I’m worried he is so heart broken that he is going to let her take all the advantage of him as she wants as a means of showing her his love. 

How much can she stomp him into the ground in a situation like this? Like, how bad can a person make another person look without any real proof? Also, every time they would argue, step mom would not talk to him but rather text or email. I’m thinking she did this to leave a paper trail or even worse, twist messages and make her look good. Because I don’t believe my dad saved all of their messages for defense as she has probably been saving all of their convos.

78,[Florida] Daughter's Responsibility with Respect to Debt of Deceased Parent,1588988872,"My partner's grandmother died with an estate that had basically no value - she had a house worth like 140k and owed like 125k (possibly more) on it and she had a car that had more debt on it than it was worth and an account with like $800. There was no will. My partner's mother would be the intestate heir (since her mother's husband is dead). Given that, after the fees and costs of administering an estate, there would be basically nothing left in the estate, my partner's mother decided to not pursue any proceeds of the estate. She just wants to allow the mortgagee to foreclose on the house and allow the car lender to foreclose on the car. 

But she wants to confirm if she has any obligations with respect to facilitating these foreclosures (or if she can just do literally nothing and let the lenders effect them) and also to make sure that she won't somehow acquire any obligations with respect to these debts of her mother. Already the car lender has been sending letters that imply that she might have to pay for the costs of repossession.

IAAL (is that an abbreviation?) but this isn't my area. I believe that my partner's mother is not responsible for the debts of her mother so long as she didn't guarantee or cosign (she didn't). I do worry that it might be possible for her to become responsible by assuming them either through statements she makes or by actions she takes. She feels like she has to help these lenders but I am of the opinion that it might protect her more to do  nothing because so long as she does nothing she won't take any actions that could be construed as assuming the debt.",legaladvice,False,yyyyyyylime,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg6fo4/florida_daughters_responsibility_with_respect_to/

80,"Roommate moved out with no warning, did not pay rent, over $1500 in damages to the master bedroom. She has completely ghosted me. How do I proceed? (US, Colorado)",1588988802,"This is a follow up regarding [my post](https://redd.it/gaq19p) from 8 days ago.

Summary from previous post: Roommate tried to break the lease under Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-402, claiming a stalker is trying to break into her window on the 4th floor at night to rape her.

In an email exchange with my roommate and the apartment manager, I told her I'm happy to work with her so this process is fair for everyone. I offered to start looking for a new roommate after finals (next week) and I'll sign her off the lease as soon as she pays for the damages to the master and May's rent.

-----

She ignored my offer and insisted she could break the lease and be absolved from this apartment with nothing more than a police report number. The leasing office manager didn't buy her story, and requested an official police report and RO. She stopped responding to emails after that.

On May 5th, she showed up with her new boyfriend (the 4th one she's been able to manipulate since living with me) and a moving truck. She packed up and told a huge lie about how a local charity is going to pay her rent and damages to the bedroom.

I haven't heard from her since she moved out (unsurprising). I sent her one final text this morning reminding her that she is still on the lease here, and she is legally just as responsible for this apartment as I am. No reply.

I'd like to start looking for a new roommate (probably not on reddit), but no one is going to move into a bedroom in this condition. The room stinks. Her cat scratched up and peed on the carpet for months. The walls are covered in grease patches where her bed was. She spilled eyebrow wax and make up all over the master bathroom counter, sink, and white cabinets. She's damaged the walls with stickers that won't come off. She ripped the screen off one of her windows and has been throwing garbage out the window onto the roof...

The maintenance manager estimated damages will cost over $1500. This apartment is newly renovated with brand new carpet installed before I moved in. He said the entire bedroom would need to be re-painted. They are going to try to get the bathroom professionally cleaned, but he is concerned about the make up stains and wax.

I applied for help through my Uni's emergency fund program when my roommate started lying about the rapist. I was approved for an $800 micro-grant, which will cover most of her rent for May. I still need to (somehow) pay for repairs to the master, have the work done, and find another roommate before June 1st.

I will continue to work as a TA while taking classes this summer, but I don't have an extra $1500 lying around. I have enough money budgeted to cover my half of rent and utilities until I get my next grant and scholarship disbursement for the fall, but that money is earmarked for rent and bills during the fall semester (I graduate spring, 2021).

I don't know what to do next. I've lived at this apartment complex for almost 5 years with perfect payment history. The leasing office manager isn't charging late fees and she's willing to work with me on this issue, but they understandably can't repair the room for free.

Sorry this post became so long... This situation is insane and I can't begin to describe the amount of stress this has caused during finals.

**TL;DR: My roommate abandoned our apartment without paying rent and left a bedroom that needs over $1500 in repairs. I can't afford to pay for the repairs or this apartment by myself, and I can't find a new roommate until the bedroom is repaired.

81,Unable to get refund on online game purchase?,1588988788,"So I play this game called Pokemon Go! on my phone.  I started playing it a year or two after it released so my characters are weak compared to most everyone elses.  After playing for a while I found that the game wasn't enjoyable because of how weak my characters were.  So I decided to start purchasing ""Downloadable Content"" or whatever you want to call it so that I could strengthen my characters faster and be able to enjoy playing the game.

Now that I'm able to get the full experience of playing the game, I'm beginning to notice that it has multiple issues (lagging, disconnecting, freezing, etc.).  I've noticed these problems long before the stay at home orders, so it's not just because of increased traffic.  The thing is I never played the game often enough to realize how often these issues occurred.  I always thought it was just my internet connection or that the game needed an update, but it's been constantly doing this for the past 3-4 months.  I switched phone carriers and I'm still having the same issues. Sometimes the game will tell me I have a weak connection when I have perfect reception.  Sometimes I can't play the game at all, recently it's started to tell me the game is unavailable and to try again later.  Some of these things have grown into a known issues apparently.  

At this point I'm tempted to just stop playing because i get more frustrated than entertained by it.  At the same time though I've put money into the game and I'd feel cheated if I stopped playing.  This is like paying for a gym membership then two days later 75% of their equipment breaks and there's such a long wait to use whatever is left that you practically can't even work out. Even worse, the gym won't refund your money. I've messaged the game developer multiple times and requested a refund on my money and their response is an apology for my inconvenience and a free item to use in the game and then they'll ask me if they answered all my questions... I might be able to screenshot their response if you want to see it.

Do I have any options here other than accepting being cheated and moving on?  I just want my money back or at least to be fairly compensated.  The free item they give me is disrespectful compared to the amount of money I've put into the game.  That free item isn't even equal to 1% of what I've spent on this game.

I did a straight trade with my own vehicle on another used car last Thursday.  Everything looked and sounded great and I was notified of a couple of very small faults that I accepted.

However, 24 hours later the vehicle i took home now has a slipping clutch which I’m going to have to replace.  I notified the car dealership via email of the fault and they have replied telling me the vehicle was sold to me without warranty due to the couple of small faults and the clutch was “clearly fine on the way home”.  They are also saying the vehicle I traded in was “not as described” and is now smoking heavily when driven so we should just call it quits. 

I should mention I drove 300+ miles to the dealership to make the trade and the car I traded in wasn’t smoking at all when I drove it down, neither has it ever smoked heavily when driving.  

the dealer inspected and test drove the trade in before saying he was happy with it and letting me take away the new (used) car.

Do I have any actions I can take here?  I really would rather keep the current car I have and just have the dealer pay for the repairs and I’m in the UK so I think I should be protected under the consumer rights act 2015 but as the dealer is saying the car I traded in is faulty as well I’m not sure if I’m fucked in this situation and just take it on the chin or if I have any options to force the dealer to pay for my repairs.

It might be worth noting my aunt was the driver of the vehicle and, I presume, was the person at-fault. She apparently took a left turn at a stop light flashing yellow (so, yield). Unfortunately, she was struck on the passenger side by oncoming traffic, killing my grandma. AFAIK there were no other deaths, but 2 other vehicles that were involved. She might also have had some intoxication as she takes pain pills and is often out of it as a result, but idk because our relationship is also quite strained and I can’t tell what my aunt is faking as she has always been a manipulative human.

Sometimes they swarm and it is not possible to go in our yard or use our pool. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old and I'm worried they will get hurt and our pets aswell.

92,Need help with info concerning Wage Theft,1588987703,"I work on an ambulance in Georgia. Around October or so of 2019 my partner and I had a particularly busy day where we ended up running 16 calls. All of them were ALS and so my poor paramedic had to tech every one. On the day in question, we had low ambulance levels the whole day, and never stopped running  and therefore didn't have a chance to complete any one of our Patient Care Reports before the day was done.  (PCR's). Now we have a policy that states that all PCR's must be completed within an hour of the call if at all possible, but they must be completed before you leave to go home with no exceptions. This means my partner had to stay after his shift was supposed to end and fill out all the PCR's that he didn't have the time to during the day. Because of the chaos of the day, it was exceedingly difficult to match the correct patient information to each call since hours had past since we had run them. He ended up staying there for the next 6 hours filling out these PCR's to completion in order to comply with policy.

He remained clocked in during this time and racked up a whopping 6 hours of overtime in one night.

But then he was later brought in to a meeting with the higher ups who questioned him about the overtime. He told them the story, but when they heard it, they just told him that they believed he could have gotten it done faster and shouldn't have had to work so much overtime. They then refused to pay him for 6 hours of overtime. They said they would only pay him 2 hours OT, and asked him to sign a document of unknown purpose. He asked to have a statement outlining this refusal of pay printed off for him including the reason for the action. They refused saying that such information was strictly proprietary. (Obvious horse shit)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a college student holding a lease that began on 6/1 and is ending on 5/31. Given the uncertainty around COVID I'm considering not renewing my lease. My understand is that my lease agreement is fixed term so I wouldn't necessarily have to provide notice (more of a courtesy thing). However, I noticed this in the fine print of my agreement. 

  *60 Days' Notice. Tenant shall provide Landlord with written notice at least 60 days prior to the expiration of this lease in the event that tenant does not intend to renew for an additional term. In the event that Tenant fails to provide notice to Landlord as set forth herein, Tenant shall be considered a holdover tenant and, at Landlord's option, eviction proceedings may be commenced in accordance with the law*

My  email:

Hello,

I'm writing to you very frustrated. I've  had a terrible series of weeks. I lost my job, my cousin (a police  officer) contracted COVID and has been in and out of the hospital in  critical condition. I had no idea that there was a one week window to  receive refunds. My cousin has only recently been deemed relatively  stable, and I finally found out about the refund situation.

This isn't right. I just called frontgate and they told me I needed to  contact you. How is it fair that we hear nothing for months until March  31, then released the refund instructions weeks later but only kept the  window open for one week? I have had many other things to worry about, and  tickets to the next Boston Calling aren't going to help any of my  problems now.  Please, do the right thing here, I'm begging you. This $539 is nothing  to a company like yours but means so much to me right now.

Thank you for reaching out.  All ticket refund requests submitted by the  deadline of April 28th are currently in process through Front Gate  Tickets.  Additionally, all requests that were received through May 5th  have been submitted to Front Gate Tickets for processing.  At this time,  the refund window is officially closed and we are unable to process  refund requests.  All tickets have been transferred to 2021, along with  applicable benefits here: [https://bostoncalling.com/refunds/](https://bostoncalling.com/refunds/).

Is that all? 

What if they ask for proof that My mom is not this person so they can take her off the records? Is she legally bind to provide them proof?  I imagine the best way to proof is probably with SSN but NO WAY am I letting my mom give out her SSN! So anything else they can use as proof? 

What if they sue her if she doesn’t prove that she’s not this person?  Sue her to collect a Debt from someone with the same name? 

What sort of documents can they ask her for to prove that she’s not this person?  

What can they do to collect this debt? What are their rights as debt collectors vs my mom who is unfortunate enough to have the same name as the person they’re after?

This is the short version; apologies in advance.

Some backstory: This happened a few years ago when i decided to pull a hail mary and move to Florida (I know I know it's always Florida) .

My mental health was in shambles (partly because of toxic co workers and partly because I was stressed). I was trying to live the life expected of me instead of the one I wanted, and somewhere down the line I had enough.

I didn't know anyone in FL. I had no connections or job set up, but something was telling me to just go. And so with the little money I had along with maxin out my credit card, I decided to make the leap.

And I probably would of been fine, I really would have, except I made the dumbest mistake (not counting student loans) of my life: I let someone tag along.

As I was sayin my goodbyes, a guy friend of mine asked if he could come with me. He had always been nice to me so I had no problems believing his ""I want to start over story"". He told me he hated his roommates and his friends treated him like an ATM. He asked if he could stay with me just until he found a job and a place of his own. He even promised to help split the bills until he was ready to move out.

I agreed. The rest of this will be hard to get out so please bear with me. I might need to come back and clarify.

The moment we moved into that FL apt, his personality took a 180. No longer was he going to help me or try to move out. He told me that he always gets what he wants and I had to do what he said. I didn't understand, and my anxiety shot through the roof. There was no telling him no. The more I said no, the angrier he got. He would get in my face and scream at me until he got his way. He wasn't physical at first, but he knew how to intimidate me. And he also knew I didn't  have anyone I could go to. I ended up keeping him content out of fear. I've dealt with abuse before but he was a monster.

Then the day came when I snapped. I was tired of being mentally forced (intimidated) to do things financially and physically for him that I didn't consent to. I'm sorry for being vague, this part is the hardest to get out, but you can use your imagination. Whatever your thinking, you're probably right.

One day I screamed back at him and we ended up getting physical. We had many physical fights. Once I called the cops and they told him to leave. I thought that was it, I thought I was free, but he came back. He was angrier than ever blaming me and telling me that he was only trying to help, and I was the one causing problems. And so he stayed. I don't know how I let myself become so afraid.

The fights continued, and he would win because I'd lose my courage. I just wanted him to leave like he was suppose to. One night, after another really nasty fight he called the police. When they showed up, I didn't even know it was them, because he broke my glasses. None of my attempts to explain to them what he had done to me worked. I even found my broken glasses to show them (although looking back, it's possible I picked up something I thought were my glasses which probably made me look crazy). I did my best to explain but I probably sounded really crazy.

I wish I knew how to talk to police while dealing with an anxiety/panic attack, but anyway, they believed him and arrested me. Though the charges were dropped, we were given no hostile contact.

We ended up moving into my car. During all of that, rent was never kept up with. He had a job but would spend all of my money, and I had no clue what he was doing with his, so we had to leave the apt. I didn't want him in my car, but he told me if I tried anything he would call the cops.

So he kept me in the backseat, while he drove. He went wherever he wanted, dumped me whenever he wanted and picked me up when he felt like it. He never let me shower or wash my clothes. He would starve me, and there was nothing I could do about it. Who would believe me? He could easily flip the story and the cops would have no reason to believe me. That's what I believed. I was no longer a person. I had to put on a show so no one would suspect. So no one would call the cops. I had to pretend. All because of fear.

Eventually he was fired and since there was no more money coming in, he told his parents about it. And his parents bought him a plane ticket to go to their place. 

I was going to be free, finally free.

We got a hotel room to separate our things and then he disappeared into the bathroom. Hours past and when I went to see what was going on, there he was on the floor trying to kill himself. I tried to talk to him and calm him down, but he wouldn't listen. And so I reached out to grab the knife he was holding and he sliced my hand. My pointer finger took the majority of the damage. The scar is still there and it's most likely that I'll have to get surgery to repair the nerve since it hasn't stopped hurting.

And he used that, my hand. He said he'd have to tell the police and I believed that I would get in trouble for breaking the no hostile contact rule. So I told him it was ok, and he stayed.

The only reason I got away was because he left me stranded. It was time to renew my car tags and even though he said he would take care of it, he never did. I found a safe place to keep my car parked, and he ruined that. Something happened to one of his family members and his folks were coming down to get him, but they didn't know he was living in my car. So he drove it without my permission to their meetup spot and when I tried to make it back to safety, I was pulled over. And as you'd expect, my car was immobilized. I called him to come back and help me but he refused. He said there was nothing he could do, and he left me completely stranded with nothing. That was the last time I saw him.

I got in contact with my mom, who was able to help me make it back to her place, but that was no easy task and the stress caused her to collapse and end up in the ER. She's alright now.

He has made numerous attempts to contact me since then, and I've never replied. I've changed my phone number and deleted email addresses that he had access to. I've tried therapy and meds but that hasn't helped. I feel like I was kidnapped that whole time (about a year I think). I can't seem to move on. I haven't had a job since then. I use to have nightmares that him and the police would show up at my door to take me away.  I just want him to confess and tell the truth but it has been almost three years, and now when I try to google him, nothing comes up. It's like he doesn't exist.

If you've read this, thank you. If there's nothing I can do I understand. If it was all my fault I understand. I just need peace. Any advice would help.",legaladvice,False,TheyTookMyBedsheet,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg5g3d/anyone_up_for_a_true_but_you_wont_believe_it/
23,[CA] Trying to locate a Last Will and Testament from a death in 1995. Can't find it filed as probate.,1588985003,"In May of 1995, my mother passed away in Orange County, California. I'm finding conflicting information about probate laws during that time. Some sources say probate is required for assets to be transferred, and some sources say assets under $150k don't need to go to probate. I could use some help.

I searched the Orange County probate court database for a case number and couldn't find anything. I even paid for a specific name search and nothing came up. Then I went to the LA County probate court website and searched there, as that was the county my mother was born in. Nothing there, either.

What are my options at this point? I had a trust fund, which my father squirreled away, but I have no knowledge of how much was in the trust fund. I know that it was variable; my dad would tell me about the amount fluctuating ""with the stocks"" but that was all the information he ever gave me. By the time I was 18, the money was gone. I was told that since I was a minor, and my father was executor of the trust fund and the estate, he had the power to do with the money what he wanted? Even then, It's now 25 years later and I doubt I'm within the statute of limitations to recoup anything on that front.

My mom is/was married to this guy since like 1996 or 1997. He left in 2004 but no legal separation or divorce was ever finalized. My mom had him served with divorce papers I don’t even know how many years ago. Considering how much debt he left in both their names I thought she was fair only asking for the house which she had been paying on since 2004 when he left. The papers never got signed and the divorce never got finalized. So in 2020 they’re still technically married. We found out recently that he died. Supposedly he has a will. My mom directed his sister to send it to her attorney since she’s worried his family is going to try to take the house she’s been paying for for the last 20 years. Even before he left she paid 2/3 of the house payment. His name is still on the deed, the house isn’t paid off.

We aren't really happy with our living arrangements currently so if we could get out we'd be happier. We have a few months left but are wondering if there's anything in place due to the virus that would help us not be negatively affected for when we recover and continue renting.

I should mention that we haven't spoken to our landlord yet to see if they would be willing to allow us to break the lease, and this is an option we will try, but I figured I'd ask here in the meantime.

My girlfriend and I live on the Peninsula in California Bay Area. 

We were in SoCal visiting my parents when the “Shelter in Place” order took effect.

We decided that it would be best to stay with my parents as we ride out the Covid-19 storm and help them out since they are elderly. 

Today we found out that her car had been towed from the public street that she normally parks her car on. This street has no signs for towing and is a normal street that anyone can park on so we thought she would be fine. Her family (The address where the car is registered: In Nebraska) just received a notice that her car had been towed due to construction on the 27th of April because of being parked in a construction zone. 

We have been “Shelter in Place” since the end of March and the street had no visible signs that there was going to be any construction done at this time. They are currently telling us that it will be a $1500 fine to remove that car from the impound since it’s been there so long and we do not have anywhere close to that kind of money right now.

We have already talked to the Sheriff of our city and he even seemed blown away by the amount since they are the ones that ordered the tow but there is nothing  they can do since it was contracted by a tow company... this all seems really really unfair. 

How are we supposed to know they were going to do construction during a pandemic? Really lost since they are charging us $90 a day for fees and we are still in SoCal trying to do the right thing. 

We are currently trying to draft a message to the Mayor but don’t know if that is the right thing to do and we really can’t lose the car.

44,[AZ] Ex housemate I do not speak to any more because of her abuse is demanding I send photos of her and her kids I took when we lived together. I do not have them any more. Her lawyer bf has sent me a letter threatening legal action. How screwed am I?,1588982384,"About 12 years ago my then gf and I lived in a share house with another couple. It worked well for a short time, but of the other couple the mother had an untreated problem with major paranoia and hallucinations, I'd guess something schizophrenic (but I'm not a doctor). She accused me of trying to take her bf, accused my gf at the time of doing the same, accused her bf of a relationship with her mother, she'd walk around the house arguing with herself loudly for half a day at a time, with episodes sometimes weekly.

I took photos of everything at the time, including her and her bf with her kids on good days. I gave her copies of all the photos.

My gf left me because of the stress and moved out, and I couldn't move for another 8 months because of the lease, but as soon as I could I noped out of there. It affected me more than I thought at the time, and took years to regain enough trust to live with anyone else again. During my recovery I deleted massive portions of my life from that time; emails, photos, everything. I'm doing OK now, and have a new partner.

The ex flatmate tracked me down at the start of the year and in a sweet well written email she told me she's lost all the photos she had that I'd taken and wanted copies of the files again. I ignored it and deleted it straight away, but she kept sending more emails, from different accounts. I ended up replying and told her I'd deleted them all and no longer had them.

This week a physical letter arrived to my street address from her new paralegal lawyer bf threatening to sue over the loss of the photos. I've checked her facebook and the legal firm, and her bf on facebook is the same one listed on the firm's site.

I'd hope she can't sue over something I never promised her I'd keep and that's technically my copyright. Am I screwed?",legaladvice,False,thrownpixthrowaway,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg4qkd/az_ex_housemate_i_do_not_speak_to_any_more/

46,WA state estate questions,1588982304,"So background: my grandfather passed away in 2010. My aunt was first in line to be executor, but lived out of state so it went to me (20yo at the time). Unfortunately I had major depression and didn't do much with the estate (I did file the will in the appropriate county) and ended up losing most of the money (I plan on paying all monies back to those in the will other than my mom and myself because we used our portions already and then some). The estate is rather small, around $5000. The house has been taken back by the bank, which is what we all wanted. All items were distributed to everyone before I became executor.

There are two accounts that I believe are still active (a credit union account and a stock share). I know I need to show them the death certificate to show he died. Q1: What else do I need to prove I am authorized to take care of things? Do I need to give them a copy of the will? If so, does it have to be an official copy? Or is a photo copy sufficient? I also got married since that time so Q2: what do I need to show I'm the same person as described as executor? Is my marriage certificate good, or is there anything else I could use? To make matters more complicated, the credit union is in OR state and I'm unsure where the stock share is, if that matters. 

Also, Q3: is there anywhere to see if I'm missing any open accounts in his name? Like a website that shows what things are in your name? IDK.

I still have all the paperwork for pretty much everything. It's kind of all over the place and not organized, but if I received anything, I saved it.

And if anyone cares, I'm doing this now because I started getting enough medication for all my mental problems to be functional within the last year and decided to go through all our stuff in storage and downsize which includes a lot of paperwork.

I don't really want to get a lawyer because there isn't much money total and I don't have money to spend on it. And I don't really want to ask a lawyer for too much for free.

52,Custody During This Pandemic,1588981921,"My ex and I have been separated for almost 6 years now and have never had a formal custody agreement. For a long time, we were able to be amicable. Basically throughout the last couple years, he would get upset about something and stop communicating with me and other childish things. I let it go because, honestly, it wasn’t ever anything that really effected me. I was irritated but that never seemed like a reason to waste the time and money on court and a lawyer to do custody. Plus I know it would be a fight and mentally taxing because he won’t agree with me on anything. 

Over the summer, he got mad at me about my decisions and stopped paying child support. That was almost a year ago. Luckily, I am able to support myself and my child without him, but that’s not the point of child support. I still didn’t take him to court. He then stopped communicating with me again so I made the decision to buy my daughter a phone, even though I didn’t want to (she’s 9) because I needed to be able to know if she’s ok. Through this, I started learning that when he has her (every weekend Friday through Sunday and some thursdays) he barely has her. He will take her to his grandparents house and then to his cousins house and sometimes he will see her for a few minutes on Saturday and then he will pick her up and drop her off to me Sunday at noon. 

This obviously upset me so I began documenting everything because I started planning on taking him to court. What has pushed me over the edge currently is that his job had a case of covid and he was exposed. I have a newborn and he didn’t tell me until he dropped our daughter off. Knowing that he exposed her. I then had to have her quarantined with my mom, which was still a risk because my mom doesn’t have the best immune system but it was safer than her being there with a newborn. So that was last week, she isn’t done being quarantined until Sunday. He wanted to pick her up on Thursday as normal. Him and I spoke about him not getting her for a month just in case which he claims he doesn’t remember saying. 

I have made the difficult decision to keep her from him. I don’t want to do this. But he is still going to work, he works in a small space with a lot of people. He doesn’t know who else was exposed. I don’t know what else to do for my daughters safety and the safety of my newborn. Legally, I know there is nothing he can do, we don’t have an agreement. But when we go to court, will this be used against me? Will a judge think I did a the wrong thing or the right thing? I feel like this is the right thing to do. If this virus wasn’t happening, I would have never even thought of keeping my daughter.

54,Adoptive father nullifying adoption and keeping my important stuff,1588981691,"Let me start by saying that my adoptive father and I have never gotten along particularly well. My younger years were pretty hell, and I can elaborate details later. He has pretty severe control issues, 

My father has made it clear that he would like to have not only my, but my brothers adoptions nullified. This is because he treated us like shit when we were young and living under his roof. However, now that we are old enough and don't live under his roof (therefore he cant control us), he's ready to be finished with us.

To make things easier to understand, he's the kind of person one posts about on r/insaneparents. Some talking points:

\-Stalked me throughout college 500 miles from home. (He would literally randomly show up around campus, driving rental cars. Security forced him to leave.)

\-Finding ways into accounts used not only for school, but personal use, and impersonating me to people who I know and friends. (This included changing passwords and accessing emails for the college I was working for at the time.)

\-Disrespects everyone that I choose to have relationships with-just because he can.

\-Threatens frivolous lawsuits because he knows that 

I tried to deal with and work with him to maintain a better father-son relationship after I moved out, thinking that this was ""normal"" and ""what everyone deals with"". I did this because I did not have an idea on what a normal parent-child relationship looks like.

THE MEAT AND TATERS' 

 After removing him and his negativity from my life, he now wants me to pick up my ""important documents"". Now, to those other Redditors who are adopted, they will have a very strong understanding of what these are-and how much they mean to someone who is adopted. These are the kinds of things like baby pictures, documents telling the story of your biological parents and things that tell the story truthfully. 

After arguing back and forth about when and where I was going to get them from him, he decided that  he doesn't have to give them back, and he would rather just burn them than give them to me.I have always preferred to do things being the 'nice guy' but obviously this is not gonna happen.

He then explains that some of the pipes need to be replaced and that he would begin the next day. He never showed.

I contacted my property manager again and the following week he sent out the same plumber who then proceeded to patch the leak with some black sealant.

This never happened. And the patch did not work at all. So.... last week I looked up the number to call the owner of the house directly. He was shocked that the ceiling was still leaking (he was under the impression that it was repaired on the plumber's first visit).

72,(California) Landlord refuses to fix appliances during COVID19,1588980048,"Hello r/legaladvice,

I just moved to a new apartment owned by a leasing company and unfortunately a decent amount of repairs needed to be done (we were restricted from viewing this apartment or doing an inspection before signing the lease due to covid). Our toilet was incorrectly mounted and was rocking back and worth, and we asked maintenance to fix it and they did. Today we discovered our dishwasher wasn't working, and we requested that maintenance repair it. They called us back to say that they are only doing emergency repairs and that a broken dishwasher is not an emergency. This is apparently due to low staffing because of the coronavirus. 

Obviously, we can just hand wash our dishes, but this was an advertized feature of the apartment, and we absolutely would not have moved here if there was no dishwasher or a broken dishwasher. I have done a bit of research, and as far as I can tell, repair and deduct is a potential option in California (a previous landlord refused to fix a leaking faucet for a week and I did this). However, I don't think that a broken appliance constitutes ""inhabitability"" as expressed under that law. Do I have any legal recourse in this situation?

I was told that they were holding my extra payment until we move out and they would add it in with my security deposit return and if any repairs would need to be made, they would deduct if from my extra rent. I might need the money to help with closing costs and this could be a very large problem.

My husband has lived with his parents all his life, some by choice and some because his father guilt him into staying to look after his sick mom. 5 yrs ago i met my husband and about 3.5 yrs ago i moved into with him and his parents. At the time his father wanted us to help fix up the farm and get it ready to sell and he would give my husband his inhertitance to start our life together.
Oh i should add before me and my husband met his father had made a ton of promises like you will get 1/3 of the equity in the house for maintaning it and or you can have the opportunity to buy the farm for whats owing on it when you get married. Those sorts of things. So for 20 plus yrs while living at the farm my husband never paid rent by money he paid it by his time 
Running the farm was and is a full time job in its self, plus he fixed all the cars and my husband even bought all the farm equipment needed to keep the farm up.
About a yr ago there was a blow up, this was about the same time me and my husband started a business and it meant being away from the farm for weeks on end. So my husband hasnt done as much around the farm but we also arent there much either. When home we buy everything including groceries and pay for our internet ect(his dad doesnt pay a penny for anything for us) During the huge blow up his father went back on all promises, he acused my husband of living rent free and taking advantage of the situation and told him he wont see a penny of the inheritance, instead it was going to all the other kids that left the family years ago(this was fine by us cause we never cared about the money other then my husband feels as tho he wasted his life away staying here this longand should be compensated for his time.)
So my question is, the FIL tried to kick us out today over something reallly stupid, and i basically said to him he cant kick us out, we havent done anything wrong, not to mention my husbands sick mother doesnt want us to leave and shes told us many times we dont have to pay any rent because we do so much around the farm.. Shes also on mortage and owns half the farm. BUT last yr the FIL had her sign power of attorney over to him and now FIL believes he can speak for her even if she says something he trumps her because in his words ""he has the power over her and she has no say"" 

We will be leaving soon anyways, we just gotta find the house we want.

I paid a lawyer a $200 consult fee back in March. He told me it would be cheaper for me to do the legwork, initially.

If, after 180 days the formal complaint hasn’t been resolved (or if I don’t agree with the outcome of the investigation), I can hire him to file a lawsuit.

They said that during the investigation, both parties must work toward resolving the issue during this process. 

One of the individuals listed in the complaint has been reassigned. They are in the same position, just a different department.

They will still be able to hurt other employees.

If the new manager gives me what I initially requested, do I have to accept it?

I’m prepared to see this all the way through. If I were to sue, it would institute a wide-reaching change to their policy. Which is what I want. Do I have to settle for less?

I married an illegal alien from Mexico a few years ago. After we got married, we filed to fix his legal status. Everything was going fine until he had to leave the country for an interview for his visa. His visa was denied and we had to file another form. During this time, our marriage was horrible. His abuse escalated and he began having affairs. Eventually, I broke down and walked away from our marriage. We never filled that form and we haven't filed for divorce yet. I also later found out, I do not have evidence of this, that his mom and him were using me for him to get citizenship.

Normally I wouldn't be apposed to doing this but I am currently on a time frame as I will be selling this vehicle.

If I were to have an interested buyer for private party sale or if I were to trade the vehicle into a dealership. Do I first need to first send the title back in to the DMV to get a new ""clean"" title, or may I go ahead and now also release the title to the buyer and when they register the vehicle, they will then pay for the new registration?

With everything currently going on in the world (COVID-19) DMV offices are not open and so I feel this process is just going to eat up more time and the ''buyer'' may not want to wait even though the bank has released interest in the vehicle. Even if the DMV offices were open I still feel like this would take an extremely long time just because it takes the bank 10-20 business to send you the title and then you would have register for a ""Clear Title"" in which the DMV usually advertise takes up to 6-8 weeks to get you a new title.

Growing up our mother was neglectful and abusive, but she was an avid worker (a bit of a workaholic) and was always at least able too give us food, clothes, and a place too live. About 2 1/2 years ago, that changed She has since quit her job, cashed out her 401k way too early, and has been moving around so abruptly and suddenly that my brother only found out by me having too tell him, because she insisted I not say anything too him and just ""surprise"" him by dropping him off in a whole other house/town while he stayed with me over breaks. This happened LITERALLY every time he came too my house, which was around every 3 weekends. Her and her BF refuse too hold jobs, they rotate between living off of her mother and my great grandparents while they dream crazy dreams, like running away too join the circus. (They actually tried too take my brother with them to join a traveling circus). I could go on and on, but I feel this is enough too price shes an unfit mother.

His father on the other hand, I am unsure of. When my mother was with him, (at least 10 years ago) he was an abusive alcoholic. I was young and dont remember much, but I do remember I didnt like him. Me and my Husband met him awhile back, and he seems too have changed his act. Hes been in AA for about 3 years, he has 2 kids that he takes care and a stable job. He says he is through with his ex wife the mother of the 2 kids he has now, who is currently in prison for stabbing him with a fork.

I have signed POAs from his father and our mother. His father signed it with the agreement that my brother would go back too him at the end of the summer. It is now about time for him too go, and my brother doesnt want too. He enjoys the school he has here, his friends, and he says his dad has hardly reached out too him at all during the 8 months he has been with me. He never had much of a relationship with his dad, and his dad has never gone out of his way too try and start one either.

Is there anything I can do too get legal custody without having too railroad his father? I dont want a legal battle, and I certainly dont want there too be any resentment between him and his dad if I make him go back. I just want my brother too be where he is happy and feels safe, and that is here.

The ground floor of the building is mainly a garage. The floor right above it is the first of three residential floors and is where I live. Some time last year the company began construction to convert the garage into new apartment units. They advertised it as ""solving the housing puzzle"" or something ridiculous like that.

As you can guess, the construction work has been incredibly disruptive. From Monday-Friday 8am-6pm, literally just below my feet is non-stop jack hammering, nailing, and sawing. If I happen to still be in my room when they are working, it is impossible to hear myself think. Luckily I have a job that allows me to work from home, but attempting it is horrendous. Business calls are impossible, and my colleagues comment that it sounds like I am ""inside hell"". I had been trying to stay in a percentage of the time due to recovering from a foot injury, but the noise has pretty much driven me out during working hours.

Anyways, fast forward to the current COVID situation. Once San Francisco's shelter-in-place orders first went out, the construction stopped which was fantastic thank god. I could not imagine being forced to quarantine in my room all day while that construction was going on, much less be able to concentrate on work. Well the calm didn't last long. Today they started rolling out plastic protection onto the floors again and posted fliers that they would resume construction next week and continue through Spring 2021. 

According to the flier: ""This work has been deemed essential by the City and County of San Francisco and is permitted to continue while the Shelter-in-Place order is active.""

This became the worst possible scenario: being trapped next to a construction site. In my opinion, it diminishes the livability of my unit. Can I legally do anything about this, such as demand some sort of compensation or challenge it?

It is in Lake Oswego, Clackamah county, Oregon. 97034.

* currently the other side is vacant and they are doing showings.
* All backyard was taken over by former tenant which were owner's family and We were ok sharing.
* My current lease does not dictate that we cannot use their side of backyard-there is no specific.
* managent is asking us not to use that side bc it is directly behind of that unit, even though it is vacant.
* &amp;#x200B;
*   
\#1 I am not sure if I am legally prohibited using that space? I mean I COULD not use that space anyway when the next tenant moves in bc it is really on their side even tough we do not have the equivalent. HOWEVER it is VACANT now and they are asking me to remove my lawn furniture seems they crossed the line. I COULD remove the furniture to show the cleaner backyard for showing but I don't think I AM OBLIGATED TO.

\#2 Can they just show up to the property (shared yards) and take pictures of the back yard with me being there without notice? I was shocked that they just showed up and taking pictures while me and my kids were on the back yard yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 can they take pictures of inside of my unit without written consent while they do annual ""inspection""? they did notice to entering unit 24 hr before, but I was surprised that they took pictures of our bed rooms and other spaces without our consent. We did consent they come in for inspection, but did not consent taking picture????

My ex recently bailed on our relationship in a way where she just took the next flight to go live with her mom in a different state. She left MOST of her belongings in our house. (we lived in my moms basement) 

She tried to get me to ship her her things which would have cost me like 400 bucks and I said I would if she paid for the boxes and shipping. She refused to do it that way, she said she would pay me back but I do not trust that as far as I can throw it, shes in a mood right now where she wants to hurt me and my mom for no real reason. 

She is 100% free and open and allowed to come and get her things. She even left a van that has both of our names on the title, but she paid for it. I have my own car, I just gave her a loan for hers which she paid me back for over venmo. 

The ex and HER mom contacted my mother today to threaten legal action... Over what, it isn't clear because they are just making stuff up, but they said ""(my moms Name) was her landlord and that means that legally the acquisition of items is between us and her""  

My mom and myself WANT her to come get her things but she said on the phone ""that she is too scared""

30,False Rape HR Email - Do I do anything?,1588975285,"Hi everyone,

Roughly two days ago I received an instagram message from an account with no followers/no pictures claiming that I raped their friend as they were sleeping. This caught me completely off guard so I took this as some weird bot account I told them to screw off, that those kinds of claims aren't funny and I never would do something like that, and then blocked them. 

My HR director calls me today and forwards me an email where the same instagram tag (only with an email account after it) claims that I raped them. They provide zero background or anything, just wrote my name, my position at the company, and then said I raped them and gave them an STD (not sure if its relevant but I did a physical two weeks ago and am clean). It is clear to me they found my linkedin, and thus my employer, through my name being on my instagram- so that was a rough lesson learned on internet privacy. 

This is a small company and we know each other well, so HR has told me they believe me and will move on (also due to the weird email address that sent the email/their changing of my foreign name spelling in the email multiple times based on what social media they got their info on/and the lack of any detail), but that this is on the record now for liability reasons. That is fine and I get it, an accusation like this is serious. That said, I am scared of this individual continuing to send harassing emails to executives at my company if they do not receive a response from HR and my company viewing me poorly as a result.

I want to forget about this and for it to go away, but I do not want to stick my head in the sand. I've never done anything remotely close to sexual assault or taking advantage of a woman. I've had girls be upset that I didn't want to date them, but I seriously can't see any of them being this mad to try and ruin my career. I don't expect any law enforcement action against me, because I didn't do anything, but I wonder if this is something I need to report to them? I doubt they care...

Sorry guys, I'm a bit scrambled, but this is the wildest thing I've ever experienced and don't know what to do as a next step and it freaks me out. Looking back I should've just never replied to a clearly fake instagram account and painted myself as a target for who knows what....",legaladvice,False,Icecoldruski,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg2p7a/false_rape_hr_email_do_i_do_anything/

36,Can I (f19) sue my roommates (m24 &amp; f24) for “stealing” my rent?,1588974875,"Before I was officially signed onto my roommates’ lease, they told me rent was $50 extra than it actually was. I moved in mid December so I paid $175 to one of the roommates not knowing I had given her $25 extra dollars for her to keep in her pocket. It was when I signed the lease that I realized my portion of the rent was only $300. I never actually lived there (I ended up moving in with my boyfriend) but I moved furniture in. I paid Jan, Feb, March and April’s rent early. Throughout those months I also paid a portion of utilities even though I wasn’t contributing to the cost of utilities. It was when I realized they were overcharging me by nearly $40 each month in utilities that I told them I wasn’t paying anymore towards utilities if they were going to overcharge for something I wasn’t even contributing to. (One of them also stole my pillow but not wanting to cause drama, I didn’t bring it up to them). 

Here is the problem. I just paid May, June, and July in advance but got a phone call today from the apartment manager telling me that my roommates haven’t paid this month’s rent. She told me they have also been late on paying every month since they signed the lease (a $100 late fee each month). Since they haven’t been paying on time, they owe a lot in unpaid rent and it is all coming out of my payments. They are basically stealing my money as their portion of rent AND the LATE FEES from their irresponsibly is coming out of the money I have paid in advance for my portion. 

The apartment manager sent me a document that she said was posted on our apartments door saying our lease would not be renewed and that if we wanted to move out before the end lease date (August 31) we could and wouldn’t be responsible for anymore rent. I asked the apartment manager if there was any way I could get my money back since I’m not living there and have paid in advance for months that I am no longer obligated to pay. She said the only way I can get the money I am owed back it to get it through my roommates.

46,Supervisor won’t pay me because my work wasn’t “good enough” for his standards.,1588974051,"Context: I’m 19 and I work for an electrical company as an electrical apprentice. Yesterday (Thursday) I worked (along with the master electrician I’ve been working with for months) on a project. Work ends at 3:30 but we weren’t even close to finished so we kept working through until around 4:30. So technically we worked 9 hours instead of the usual 8.

Now since this was on a Thursday, our company let’s us leave an hour early on Friday since we would have worked 40 hours already. (I’m not sure if this is because our company is cheap or doesn’t like paying overtime but that’s another story) When we finished the actual job we just did not have the time to make everything look super pretty but that could easily be tweaked the next day.

Our supervisor wasn’t happy about our results. We explained to him that we it was most likely going to be fixed the next day but he didn’t seem to understand. He actually gave me some shit for not finishing something cosmetic when EVERYTHING electrical is completely finished.

FFW to today when I asked my supervisor during lunch if I was cleared to leave an hour early since we worked until 4:30 the day previous. He said that we “can’t because you guys didn’t do a good job yesterday and you gotta fix it today”. So on my time card I was told to put 8 hours and was pissed about it.

We returned to our project today and it only took us around 30 mins to complete it. Eventually 2:00 rolls by and sup comes in and sees our finished work. He then proceeds to say that it’s too late to start anything new and we can “take off now” for the weekend. So both my hourly totals and my coworker’s for the week are 39 instead of 40 and now I’m losing an hour of pay.

I plan on going to my boss about it because I’m pretty sure what he’s doing is 100% illegal. I don’t think he can take away an hour of my pay because according to him it “isn’t good enough” and it’s “too late to start anything new”. I was on the clock working so I should get payed.

On April 20th, I ordered an iPad Pro 12.9” and Apple Pencil. I paid for expedited shipping and was told 3 to 5 business days for my delivery, but didn’t receive it for 10 business days. Now during all this COVID confusion, I understand that it took more time. I requested a refund on my $15 shipping charge due to the delay, which they accommodated.

I checked my account, and received the credit back for the shipping, but also received the full amount for the iPad as well. I called Apple yesterday and spent over an hour on the phone with them trying to figure out what happened. It appears that the person I spoke to about the shipping filed a shipping investigation in error, even though I did tell them that I received my iPad. 

The “supervisor” I spoke to yesterday told me that they understood that this was Apples error and made arrangements to charge me for the iPad a second time, to fix the money I was refunded in error. She identified herself as a supervisor multiple times. I told her that I would need a specific timeframe for the charge, as it would exceed the limit I have in place for online purchases. She assured me that it would be done by midnight, so I called my bank and cleared the limit until midnight yesterday. She also told me she would be sending me AirPod Pros and a gift card for the amount of time I had spent up until that point dealing with this, which I appreciated.

Today, someone from their billing department called me and told me they didn’t get to it yesterday and would try again either today, or within the next couple of days. I’m very uncomfortable with clearing my limit for any longer than a few hours as I’ve had my bank account compromised before, and also told them the name and email of the person I spoke to about my payment arrangement for the previous day. They had no record I spoke to anyone, and no notes on my account about the promises she had made me.

At this point I have no idea what to do. I contacted apple myself about their error, I made the arrangements I had to make, and I was promised compensation for the issues I’ve had. The manager I spoke to today was very short with me, and repeatedly stated that it sounded like I was refusing to pay for the iPad. I already paid for the iPad.

56,Had to cancel vacation due to covid. Owners of home we rented are refusing to refund or let us reschedule. [oregon],1588973491,"Title says it all, really. 

My family is very large and we plan a giant family get together every year. 

We found an amazing Oregon coast house and rented it for April, 2020. And then covid happened. 

My parents were quarantined in Palm Springs and unable to leave due to my mother’s severe asthma (the warm weather is better than the weather in bend for this). 

The homeowner is refusing to refund and said we could rebook: 

-	we tried for dates in September and she said no because it’s more expensive then. Fine, I work in the same industry and this is common practice so no problem. 
-	we tried for same dates in April of 2021 and she said no, because they give preferential treatment to first time renters. Now this I’ve never heard of - it’s utterly bizarre. 
-	she said she’d “send us small blocks of availability 2-4 weeks in advance. We are a family of 23 people and all adults have careers. We can’t spontaneously plan a trip with two weeks’ notice and told her this. 
-	she is now refusing to reschedule OR refund and says we can go through her lawyer 
-	her contract is amazing, actually! There is literally no Act of God clause. Barring an actual meteor strike there is no way I can see to fight her on this. 

Like I said I’m in the same industry but on a much larger scale. When covid happened we happily refunded hundreds of thousands of dollars in stays because it was the right thing to do. It’s a bit frustrating this woman is keeping five thousand dollars that we really don’t have to just give away, and is being so callous about it.

Bit of background information I’m studying at a British University and I live in a 6 bedroom house that’s privately owned, however all communication goes through the property management company I pay rent to.

2 of my flatmates flew back to Italy a few weeks into lockdown while my other 3 flatmates continue to live in the house.

I emailed my landlord 5 days ago asking if I can get an early release from my lease as I am no longer living there and struggling with money due to being fired from my job due to COVID cutbacks and that I can take my stuff as soon as I’m allowed to.

I received a reply the next day telling me that rent is still required and if I need financial support, go to my guarantors. Fair enough, that’s what I expected.


However, I received an email from the company we pay our bills to informing us that the two Italians no longer are paying bills as they’ve provided proof of being let off the tenancy  and this shouldn’t affect us in any way (meaning I still pay my flat rate of £40 a month).


From asking one of the girls that left to Italy, she informed me the landlord has said providing she’s taken all her belongings he will cut the rent by a half.

Once I agreed to return to work,  my employers then told me they could only pay me for a portion of my previous hours. I wrote them an email stating that I believed that to be incorrect, as they could pay me what I was receiving prior to COVID-19.

Now they are giving me two options: Take 13.5 hours of pay when I was previously scheduled for 30, or Take the 30 hours per week but do a ton of extra work for them that is not in my contract. 

Isn't the PPP supposed to keep people OFF unemployment- they wrote that their CPA told them they only have to pay me for the hours I'm actually working- 13.5. With only 13.5 hours of pay- I would still need to be on PPP- however, most likely wouldn't receive unemployment to make up for the additional hours.

Any advice is much appreciated! Its hard to find information about the PPP that isn't specifically just about what qualifies a small business to receive the loan. What are the rules about how and when its supposed to be used to pay employees? Do employees HAVE to be actually working for the exact amount of hours in order to be compensated?

79,Received small claims citation for a property we do not and never have owned,1588972556,"Location: Texas, USA

Plaintiff [P] vs. My Parents [MP] and some trust [ST]

P does not have an attorney, and we do not plan on getting one either unless the situation escalates. 

P filed a small claims lawsuit against MP and ST alleging that MP and ST had failed to return a rent deposit and some additional fee for a home P had rented for 3 years. The issue is that MP has absolutely no association with P, ST, or the property in question. Googling ST doesn’t turn up with any information either. 

The property address was also never listed on the citation. We had to call P (Texas is a one-party consent state, so we made sure to record the call) to request the address. We did not say anything that could be considered offensive, and we made a point to express our confusion and refute any claims that P made during the call (such as claiming that P and MP had met before). P could not explain how P had linked MP to ST or to the property.

I was able to find public property records for the home and only ST is listed under the ownership. The property had only ever been owned by ST and the previous owners [PO]. Included in the citation we received were the records for a previous suit P had filed against ST and the PO. That suit had been dismissed. 

We’re all very confused as to how P got our information. MP does not rent any property. The only property owned by MP is the home we currently live in right now. In fact, MP has only ever owned two properties in Texas, and neither of them are addresses related to the property in question. The only similarity one of them has is the county, and it’s certainly not our current one. MP also hasn’t owned that property since like 2011, much earlier than the 2016-2019 time range given by P. 

I’d really appreciate some advice for what to include/say in our written defense. Are there any key points that we should highlight? 

My sibling is also pushing for MP to consider a counterclaim for defamation and loss of time. It’s highly doubtful that MP will choose to pursue a counterclaim however. Filing an answer would be free and relatively painless while filing a counterclaim would cost money.

My state had a stay at home order, but we where considered “essential.” Still a bit risky because we travel to customers homes to do improvements. 1 family even recently traveled by plane 2 days before we got to their home.

Flash forward to today where it’s over a month from my email to HR. They said, sorry. You can’t enrollment until November, but we can let you contact them yourself to apply on your own. 

Hold on. I’ve tried to apply twice during your deadlines. It shouldn’t be my responsibility for you to fill out your part of the paperwork. This entire time I’ve been at risk of working and had the opportunity not to work and make more on unemployment, and you can’t even make sure I have my health insurance? Wtf.

90,"Brand new band member asking for contract prior to new album release, advice on what is fair and should I be concerned...",1588971091,"Here is the situation, I created a band about a year and a half ago and digitally released a small EP via CDBaby along with customized branding, social media and a website. From there, the band grew and new songs and members were added. We played a large number of shows, did interviews, the works. 

&amp;#x200B;

More than halfway through writing for a new album, our violinist (lets call him Steve) had to leave unfortunately due to personal issues. He left on great terms, and is still a very good friend of mine to this day. However, we were in a bind since we were locked into a production schedule, we had to find a replacement quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Through friends of friends we found a new violinist who offered to finish Steve's parts and wrote out the remainder of the violin for the new album and combined it with some of Steve's works. There was no contract or verbal promise made. From there, we offered him a spot in the band since he was talented and seemed interested. 

&amp;#x200B;

This brings us to current day,  we are a couple of weeks out of releasing the new album when our new violinist hit us with a request for a contract designating royalties to each band member should this album be profitable and rights to trademarks/ decision making policies for the band.  


Generally, this is not a concern, however this new violinist has been flippant in band related maters and has only been a part of the band for 2 months. The other members, including myself, are hesitant for this conversation since it seems some what bold coming from such a new member who honestly hasn't added or sacrificed nearly as much as the rest of the group. Nor has he financially invested like the rest of the band has, only paying for a very small portion of the production cost for additional edits to his violin.

&amp;#x200B;

I already own the trademark, branding and rights to the name of the band from the publishing and distribution completed previously a year and a half ago, right?  


Assuming this new member just wants to discuss royalty percentages of this new album, what would be considered fair?   


He has not been in the group long, he did not write any part of the songs other than what he wrote to finish out the portions of the missing violin tracks and he only paid a very small portion of the production/ marketing cost. Is he legally obligated to any royalties?

I called the apartment building and spoke to the manager who said that I had moved out on time, had given notice, and didn't owe anything. I called corporate and the agent said I didn't submit notice.   


My move out date was February 1st.  In early December, I was asked by the leasing office if I planned to renew. I let them no that I would not be renewing. This was only verbal communication and not with the manager. I stopped by again on the 4th (60 days prior) to attempt to speak with the manager. The same person was there and confirmed that he had made a note of my verbal notice to move out but that I could email the manager to confirm. I sent her an email the next day - December 5th.   


I forwarded the email to the corporate agent and he has now sent a new bill for $2170 -  
$68 rent 2/1 to 2/1  
$137 rent 2/2 to 2/3  
$1698 reletting fee

$167 utilities 11/21-2/1

$75 cleaning

97,Vet chipped our cat's tooth (NYC),1588970376,"Hi, like many, I never thought I would post here, and I'm not even sure if there is any legal route to take, though I'm concerned the vet has been negligent. My cat had trouble urinating (a common issue), and so we took him to the vet. He had to stay two nights (Wednesday - Friday), and have a catheter in. The first night, he removed his catheter overnight. He did the same the second night, we're not sure if they had a cone in him or implemented any additional precautions after he removed it the first night. Apparently he removed his e-collar before removing his own catheter.

Due to the pandemic, we are not able to physically enter the building, so we are unable to visit him.

We were told yesterday we would be able to pick him up today and that he had improved. After calling 3 times over two days to see what time we should pick him up, each time reception assured we would get a call back, they finally called us. Apparently, he has been quite aggressive (he's obviously in pain and terrified), and they've been keeping him in the cage as much as possible, but 10 minutes before they called, he (in their words) ""lunged at one of the technicians"" in an attempt to get off the table. The technician apparently caught him mid-air, and in the confusion his front canine was cracked to the point of needing removal.  They don't know where he hit his head, they don't know how the tooth was cracked, but they have offered to remove the tooth without charge. 

We have also just been told he needs to stay over the weekend for bladder surgery to remove bladder stones, which will occur today, and that the tooth will be removed directly after the surgery. They allegedly discovered ""pea sized"" stones that could not be passed via the catheter, and that it was discovered by an ultrasound after an x-ray (which they take when they insert the catheter to ensure it's well placed). I don't understand how this was missed over the past two x-rays and how we are only just now being informed that he needs surgery.

My concern is that, they said he had been ""feisty"" and ""aggressive"" the entire stay, so is it neglectful that they had him in a situation where he could escape and chip his tooth? We're upset he will need to have his tooth removed, we're upset we had to call several times before the vet called us back to update us, and we're upset that we were clearly told yesterday afternoon we would be able to pick him up today and that now he has to stay until the end of the weekend, costing us twice as much as the original quote.

I was taking Descovy for prevention since about 2015.  At the time, Descovy was not FDA approved for prevention, only for treatment.  In May 2018, I was hired by the federal government and needed a medical clearance for my job.  In the initial hire process, they approved me taking Descovy for prevention under the requirement that I got provided a statement from my doctor and lab results every year on my birthday.

In January 2019, I went to renew my medical waiver.  It was denied and I was not allowed to work because Descovy was not FDA approved for prevention.  After over a month of back-and-forth between myself and my employer's medical department, I gave them permission to discuss the matter directly with my doctor.  My doctor then advised me that he was changing my medication because my employer told him that ""my insurance did not cover Descovy"".  I was changed to Truvada (which is FDA approved for both prevention and treatment) and I got my medical clearance back and I was allowed to return to work.

In October 2019, after my prescription refills ran out, I decided I was tired of jumping through hoops just to keep my job and stopped taking the medication.  In December 2019, I slept with someone that at the time did not know he had HIV.  In January 2020, I got extremely sick for about 10 days.  After about Day 7, I finally went to an Urgent Care where they could not figure out what I had, so they tested me for STDs.  I was later informed I tested positive for HIV.

In February 2020, I informed my employer of my status and my medical clearance was immediately revoked and I was not allowed to work until I jumped through several more hoops including: getting my viral load below 10,000, my CD4 above 350, and getting a cognitive function test.  After two weeks on medication (ironically, a combination of Descovy and another medication), I met the criteria and received my medical clearance back and was allowed to return to work.

Coincidentally, in December 2019, Descovy was approved for prevention... something my doctor had argued with my employer to begin with.  He had been following the studies.

Do I have any legal stance on this?  My doctor changed my medication under false pretenses.  I was coerced into changing medications just to keep my job.

11,[MO] Denied unemployment for quitting my job to undergo substance abuse treatment,1588969192,"tldr; Quit my job because I wasn’t eligible for FMLA and went to rehab. Denied unemployment for quitting my job. Should I file an appeal?

In March of this year I decided, at the behest of my therapist, to enter a 30-day residential treatment program for substance abuse and other underlying mental health disorders. I was working at a large-scale department store and had already taken two a two-week “mental health” leave, but my counselor assured me that I could file for Family and Medical Leave and keep my position held. It turned out, however, that I was 30 days shy of being employed there to be eligible, so I explained my situation to a manager, resigned my position, and left for inpatient. 

Then two weeks into treatment, shutdowns began, me and my rehab buddies were sent home, and the retailer I worked for closed its doors before the mall it was housed in did. 

To complicate matters, my housemate who chauffeurs me to appointments, etc. is on dialysis, so hasn’t been all too keen on me working with the public just yet, though I am able and available. So I applied for unemployment on April 9, hoping to offer some help and continue paying my bills. 

I understand that the state is inundated with claims at the moment, but I’ve received nothing from them aside from the initial message that my claim was accepted. I’ve been able to request payment each week, but haven’t received any money. The website has only shown that there’s been a “pending issue”, so I finally called today and learned that I’ve been denied for quitting my job. 

I was getting ready to write my appeals letter, but before I do, I wanted to ask if I’m barking up the wrong tree. Should I have done something differently (legally speaking)? Should I continue waiting for correspondence, or do I need to send receipts of treatment bills? And mostly, so I have the right to appeal?

15,My father died of COVID in a nursing home last week and I'm unable to obtain any information on his death because I'm not listed as a health proxy/party of contact. NYC,1588968498,"What I'm seeking:

Legal advice to consider legal actions because I can't compete with this level of possessiveness. I also suspect negligence on the nursing home's behalf as their avoidant behavior of not answering phones in the midst of a pandemic is questionable. I would also like to know about the validity of health proxies after death and how it may impact this situation. I cannot accept being left in dark as a blood relative, not knowing where is body is.  
What happened:  
My father passed of COVID complications on April 29th in a Manhattan nursing home. My mom and I have been in contact with the nursing home but they refuse to provide any info on his death or funeral arrangements. In the weeks leading up to his death we phoned many times, calls were rarely answered. When my mom got through, she was told someone would get back to her but of course they didn't. When she did reach someone, they had told her he had contracted the virus, but he was okay and on oxygen (it wasn't clear whether that meant ventilator or not). Later on she was told he was on antibiotics. Eventually, we were discreetly notified of his death 5 days after his passing through a health aide personally known by my mother. His health proxy/party of contact is a woman who is abrasive, possessive, avoidant, and withholds all his information.  
Background:  
I am 29 years old and I'm his only child, he and my mother were never married though they separated when I was a toddler (due to financial issues on his part, and my mom obtaining a job opportunity overseas &amp; his unwillingness to join her). I maintained contact with him, spent summers with him and I also lived with him for two years as a teen. His health proxy is a woman whom he dated before AND after being with my mom - that timeline is problematic news to me. This woman named 'S', has a lot of animosity towards my mom. Apparently my father left her for my mom back in the 80s, she would call my mother demanding to speak to my father. 'S' is the one who had him admitted to the nursing home in 2015 after he showed signs of dementia. She didn't bother notifying my mother. My mother instead found out from his neighbor a few weeks later when paying him a visit. My mother and I had disagreed with the idea of placing him in a nursing home, she offered to pay his rent so he can keep his apartment, have some independence, and have some sort of personal health aide. 'S' objected and gave the apartment away. She also yelled at my mom for the idea of letting me live with my dad back when I was a teen.   
A large part of why I'm not listed as a health proxy is likely because I became somewhat estranged from him in the last 10 years. We had a turbulent history, as he was short-tempered &amp; verbally abusive to me. For this reason, I kept my distance and was never 'ready' to visit him and reconcile although I had intended on doing so since last year. My mother had visited him every few months throughout the years.   
Whenever my mother encountered 'S' at the nursing home, 'S' would yell and make a scene - 'S' would tell her to stay away from my dad and stop trying to be a part of his life. According to my mother, my father didn't mind my mother's visits. There were also times where my mother inquired about being added as a proxy but was refused because of 'S'. My mother phoned 'S' this week to inquire about my father's death and her response was ""your daughter was not close to her father, leave me alone, there won't be a funeral, it's over! don't call me again!"".

 I haven't spoken to 'S', I am afraid to do so as I'm not mentally/emotionally prepared for her abrasive attitude, yelling, etc. If she is that way towards my mother, she could act the same towards me.",legaladvice,False,conseillezmoi,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg0khe/my_father_died_of_covid_in_a_nursing_home_last/

19,Bank charging multiple overdraft fees for money that keeps getting taken out then put back into my account,1588968274,"(Live in the US if that helps)

Hi, first time post here

I do my banking with TD Bank and during the month of April I miscalculated when my paycheck was coming and went into overdraft.

That’s fine, my mistake and for the money I spent I understand those charges come with the fee. 

However, I had five Venmo transactions where the money was repeatedly taken out then denied by my bank and put back.

Each time I was charged an OD fee which was never put back. It ended up equaling to over $500 in charges. Five times over what I paid Venmo in the first place.

I’m furious and called the bank asking why they allowed the charges to go through only to deny them and keep charging me fees for the same money that was ultimately never taken out.

The employee tells me they can only reverse two as a “curtesy”. I say I know that’s not true as every time I have returned an item that has put me into OD in the past the fee was also put back.

Suddenly, it then turns into “well your account won’t allow that”.

We go in circles and I ask if I can talk to someone who does know why my account won’t allow that, and apparently there’s no one higher than her in the building due to COVID. 

I said I understand but would like to at least email someone in management then. She tells me it’s not possible. Refuses to give me any way to contact someone higher up.

Magically she’s able to speak to an “ambassador” though. I ask if I can speak to them, she tells me no. Half hour on the phone and they’re still refusing. At that point I hung up before I lost my temper. 

I guess what I want to know is if there’s any way to take this further and find a way to contact someone higher up and fight this. It’s a lot of money and my fiancé and I are both furloughed for the next couple of months. 

I’m also angry because I know it’s a blatant lie that there’s no one above her that I can speak to. I hate confrontation and this whole thing has me upset.

I really appreciate any help. I guess I just want to know if it’s a lost cause or not. I apologize if this is the wrong place for this specific problem but I wasn’t sure where else to ask.",legaladvice,False,GrayscaleNovella,/r/legaladvice/comments/gg0hyh/bank_charging_multiple_overdraft_fees_for_money/
20,My boss wants me to give back a months worth of pay after he already skipped paying me for 2 weeks,1588968123,"Hello everyone I could use some help with this situation I’m in. For some background: I (19M) recently got a new job at a marketing agency. With everything going on I considered myself very lucky to have gotten hired here just days before everything shut down. I am a freshman in college going for a computer science major so this job really fit me and my degree. 

I met my boss after 1 phone call where he hired me on as a 1099 contractor. I was perfectly okay with this as I like contract work more than actual jobs. However, about 6 weeks later the virus started sweeping the nation he wanted me to come on as a full-time W2 employee. This was exciting because I’ve never had a full time job before. Especially exciting because of the projects I will get to work on. 

Now for a little more context: I had been paid a single paycheck throughout this 6 week period. Contractors are paid monthly instead of every 2 weeks. So I was expecting another payment in about another 2 weeks. 

However, he informed me that because he was moving me from a 1099 to a W2, that the IRS would find this very sketchy and they would audit him. He informed me that he would have to increase my pay for one pay period and that I would have to pay back the equivalent of whatever I made in the first month of being hired. This ended up being about $1,600. I don’t really know anything about the IRS or why this would look sketchy but I agreed. This is when he informed me that I wouldn’t be paid for 2 weeks that I had worked before the transition. I had worked about 120 hours in those two weeks. So it would have come out to about $750. That might not be a big paycheck for some people but that’s a car payment and half of a month of rent for me. 

And then, after all that, he tells me that he’s not going to be increasing my pay and IN FACT I’m going to be a a salaried employee so I will be only paid for 40 hours a week. So not only am I losing the 2 weeks of pay, I’m also going to have to pay back the first $1,600 so in all I am having to give up about $2,350???

Can someone explain to me what is happening and what the heck I can do to keep from losing this money? I know everyone is going to tell me to quit but I really can’t afford that right now. This is the only workplace in town that goes with my major, also everywhere else is closing or going out of business due to the virus.

One roommate said they were gonna move out a month early and we all agreed it would be ok for them to move out a month early.

We didn't find out until they messaged us telling (btw there was NO communication about this, just a ""I'm moving out"" statement. No questions or regards to the rest of the tenants), that they were gonna move out early and not pay for May. 

This was a really annoying move because many of us are struggling from COVID-19 and this financial hit of rent raising unexpectedly was really frustrating. To top it off, they left garbage here that we had to take care of (big garbage!) Despite the fact that we told them to take it to a dump since it was too big for the trash people to take. They also left hair, rips in the walls from paintings, and their still moist towels in the bathroom. The remaining tenants have all decided we want to keep their part of the deposit to pay for the clean up we had to do and the rent they jumped out on.

Are we legally allowed to do this? All the money we pay goes to one guaranteed person so the rental people told us it was on the tenants to figure out the security deposit.

My wife had A friend that she worked with whom got a kitten knowing that their apartment complex did not allow it but got it anyway and had to hide it from the landlord. Well push comes to shove her friends marriage was going through a rough patch to where the wife left with their kids out of state and the friend could not care for the cat because he was afraid he was going to get evicted because of it. So my wife offered to take the cat until he got a new place and originally he agreed to pay for all the food and board for the cat for the duration that we had her. That lasted one week and he only gave us $40. In the course of him trying to get his marriage back together he had a falling out with my wife and essentially their friendship ended they stopped talking and he never once inquired about the cat. Flash forward 7 months and the kitty has bonded with both of our cats has the freedom of the entire house and has accepted me as her human with head bumps hand licks lots of purrs night time snuggles and will not leave me alone when I’m in the room. This was quite the change from the original living conditions because her friend had young kids that would not treat the kitty nicely they both worked and was hardly home and since it wasn’t allowed they had to confine it to one room of the apartment. We feel that they have abandoned the cat with us and she’s a perfect fit for our other two cats so we don’t want to give her back anymore. They get their marriage back together about 3 months ago and not once ask about the cat. My wife gets a text 3 weeks ago asking about the cat but she ignores it since they are still in the same apartment. Last night my wife gets another late night text from her old friend stating that since we don’t want to give the cat back we basically stole the cat and they will try to use the legal system to get it back. My question is how can they do that and what can we do to prevent it?

28,Car Rental Company - Unfair practices,1588967351,"Needed some help with a situation I am in, not sure whether this is the correct group but I will give it a try :) sorry for the long post, it is a little complicated! 

My dad rented a low-roof 8 seater van from a local car rental company (in B.C) Jul 2019. He signed the contract, got the keys, inspected the vehicle; but when he got in the van ready to leave to pick up our family that had landed at the airport, he was stopped and asked to take another vehicle. He waited for an 1.5 hrs for this other vehicle to arrive, at this point our family was extremely concerned since they didn't have a mode of communication to contact us. Once this new vehicle arrived, it was a high roof 8 seater van, that my dad was not comfortable driving, but they essentially forced him to take it. When he asked them to draw up a contract for it which includes damage protection for the roof + under carriage, the employees said they were too swamped and would take care of it later. It had been 2 hours at this point, so my dad asked them to draw up the contract again but it was going to take longer so he left to get my family.   


After a couple days of driving this vehicle, as my dad was pulling into a hotel, the roof of the hotel was extremely low and it damaged the top of this high roof vehicle. He immediately took it back to the car rental company and told them about the damage and the manager said that he had a friend who would get it fixed and we could settle this between us. We tried calling the manager to get updated repeatedly but received no word. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Jan 2020, my dad was out of the country in his home town on his pre-planned trip but was experiencing some health issues that he was dealing with when we received a 'Final Demand' Legal Notice from the head quarters of this rental company, demanding almost $16,500 for damages. They claimed we had ignored their previous letters (which we never got) so they had their paralegal send this final notice threatening to take us to court. Over e-mail communication, we kept giving them an update about my dad's health condition and his inability to deal with the issue when he wasn't in Canada but they kept pressurizing us and kept using threatening language. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we requested them to send over the documentation, they sent us an unsigned contract with paperwork that was evidently manipulated. Majority of the paperwork had mistakes &amp; wrong information -  for example: they have a damage estimate document from a local garage that they got the car fixed from dated Sept. 2019 but they have attached a final demand notice dated 3 days after the incident happened (Jul 2019) with the $16,500. They also have a damage waiver document with the information for the Low Roof van that we never even rented.

31,"Employer withheld but did not pay unemployment insurance, possibly other taxes and has not provided a w2",1588967094,"I worked full time at a small business from Feb-August 2019. In June of that year my employer had cash flow problems and there were 3 separate 2 week periods where we were not paid on time. Ultimately I did get paid and I quit after it seemed clear that she wasn’t getting any more responsible. 

During the time I worked for her I was paid in personal checks or cash a number of times and received pay stubs that had a breakdown of taxes withheld. I regret not questioning and pushing the situation more at the time but my boss was emotionally manipulative and it was a caring position so I was overworked and exhausted. 

I heard from former coworkers that the situation had improved a lot and that there had been no more pay gaps so, not very smart, I started working for her again part time in late Feb of this year until the pandemic started. I haven’t been into work since then. 

I applied for unemployment for my 2nd part time job (unrelated to the employer in question) and discovered that ESD had no record of my hours and wages from the employer in question, therefore I was entitled to very little compensation as my 2019 income outside of that job was very low. 

She has told me many times that she will provide my W2 and I have kept asking. I’ve asked her for an explanation about unemployment taxes and she hasn’t responded. I’m still hoping that there’s some other explanation and that I won’t have to go through with some remedy but that’s looking less likely.

36,[KS] Could I claim damage after someone hit my rental car?,1588966861,"On early January, my rental car was rear ended by a high schooler. This is a rental car, so rental car company did deal directly with high schooler's insurance company (State Farm) for vehicle damage claim. State Farm did resolve the claim with the rental car company. 

My company dispatched me to this town for work for only a few months. Because of this, I did not drive my own vehicle but do long term rentals at this town (my employer will not reimburse rental cost). After this rental vehicle was damaged, I did need to rent another car until I finished my work assignment. In this process, it wasted me a few hours by: (1) The rental car company will only accept damaged vehicle in their local airport location because they will only do inspection at airport location. I spent approximately 3 hours returning the vehicle to the airport and handling all paperwork. (2) After I submit the paperwork, I did communicate rental car company's claim department several times about this claim including sending all documentations to them. (3)  I did rent another vehicle from rental car company.  

I do want to submit a claim to State Farm for like 2-week car rental reimbursement and some reimbursement on time spent on handling the claim. However, I am worrying that State Farm will claim that this is a rental car, not your own car, you do not suffer any loss of use. You are not eligible for rental reimbursement. If I tell them that my vehicle is in somewhere else, they may claim that your work will need a vehicle anyway, we will not reimburse your cost. I am also afraid that State Farm will  claim that you spent time handling this claim because your rental car company require you to do so, not State Farm. State Farm has no obligation to reimburse your time spent on this. Here is my question: **What is a reasonable claim/rationale I can establish on this matter because I did spend time and efforts on this matter?

That ended with the police being called on him and arresting him with domestic violence. My wife decided not to press charges but the city prosecutor went after him anyways because he was being a ""jackass and needed to learn his lesson."". Things have cooled down a little bit since then or so we thought. 


Fast forward to now and my wife and I are outside the US and won't be back anytime soon due to covid-19. Before leaving we had our mail sent to his house and forgot to forward our mail after what happened last year. We made less than $24,000 last year and should've been sent a stimulus check for $2,400, which would be extremely helpful for us right now. 


We called him to ask if our check was sent to him. He said our check arrived and said that he could go to his good friend, who's a branch manager at his credit union, and he could help us get our money. His dad tried to convince my wife to send him a message via messenger and he said it was all the bank needed. A message authorizing my father-in-law to cash the check so he could wire us the money. My wife sent a brief message but this is without her signature. 5 minutes after her dad said he had the half of the cashed check and he was going to wire the money to us. 10 minutes later he said that he would only send $700 to us and give us the rest when we fly back to the US. Obviously we said no and he should send us all our money. That turned into an argument and ended with him saying that he wouldn't send us our money. We haven't heard from him since.


Later we then found out that he made an arrangement with his friend, even before we asked about the check, that the bank demanded 50% of the check for him to be able to cash it. We don't have any accounts with that credit union anymore so we don't owe them anything.

40,Can an organization change the vesting schedule of a retirement plan after you're hired? (DC/USA),1588966620,"I work at a non-profit organization with which I had accepted a job offer that included employer matching of x% contributions after 21 months. 2 months before starting this position, I had been working with this organization for 3-4 months that HR confirmed in writing would count towards those 21 months.

 

As I've been working in my current position for about 1 1/2 years, I asked HR to confirm when my employer would start matching my contributions. They responded that ""The retirement plan was adjusted July 1, 2019 [4 months after my start date] and the new adoption had a few changes- one of which requires 24 months without a break in service"", so I'm not only losing the 3-4 months that I had previously worked with this organization, they've also added 3 months to requirement which means I've effectively lost at least 6 months of employer matching.

 

Do I have any recourse here - legal or otherwise? As a non-profit employee in a fairly expensive city, losing that $1500-2000 (they match at a fairly high rate, but have a long period before matching - which I was OK with considering I had thought it would have only been 17 months or so) is not ideal.

49,Tenant without lease won’t come get his stuff.,1588966378,"Hi there so 3 weeks ago my brother overdosed in his house. He’s alive but not well. The day this happened I went in and told his scumbag junky roommates whom of which have nothing on paper and no lease agreement that they have a week to leave. There was 3 roommates at the time. The one roommate we’ll call Chad was out of province at work, so we decided to give him an extra week but we told him that there is to be no one in that house for the last week but him and if we find anyone else in there it’s considered trespassing. We changed all the locks and left the back door open for him. Chad never paid rent and me and my family are pretty sure he developed a bond with James so that he could use James place as rent free storage. Chad then moved 3 more junkies into the house and then took a job out of province and left. 

I have 2 brothers - well say the brother that overdosed is James. James was in an accident 13 years ago that left him paralyzed. James ended up getting a settlement that was put in a trust. The trustee is my other brother Kyle, technically the house that James lives in is under kyles name. 

You can imagine how hard James’ life has been being paralyzed for 13 years. James is 28 years old. He’s severely depressed and has lots of money for drugs. Chad and the 3 roommates used him for his money.

All of James’ consumables are gone and I had gone on a shopping trip with him a few days prior to the overdose. The 2 months worth of meat from Costco is all gone, weed gone, pop gone, Wallet gone. These junkies even went as far as to steal all of Tyler’s chargers, head phones, anything of value. And left the house absolutely destroyed. We plan on coming in and fixing his house. 

We asked chad to have his stuff out for this past Monday to which he said no problem. Monday night he called me and said he’d be there for Tuesday. I said no problem but I triple checked over the phone that his stuff would FOR SURE be out Tuesday. Tuesday night I received no messages from him after I had asked him to message me when he was out of the house. so I drove up to my brothers place and one of the old roommates was asleep in the basement at 10:30 at night. Told him to get the fuck out sent chad a message letting him know how highly disrespectful that was and that we knew he was going to lie about it. 

Next day me and mom go up to the house and send Chad a message saying if he doesn’t have his stuff out of the inner part of the house and moved to the garage in the next 2 hours it was all going out onto the street. He came by with a million excuses to which I shut his ass down told him he thinks of James as a storage unit and nothing else and that he left my brother with the vultures.

* Go through my own insurance to pay for drywall repair
* Wait it out and see if floor 3 steps up and her insurance pays for drywall repair

55,"Abusive soon-to-be ex-husband leaves handprints on our 1 y/o daughter and the court isn't even looking at pictures for evidence, they're just doing what is easy",1588965972,"Hello!
Obligatory on mobile. First time poster. In US/Utah.

Anyway. I'm in the middle of a nasty divorce with an abusive man. I have a protective order against him and he's violated it 3 times. He's having a hearing in a month for that (it's a 3rd degree felony since it's his third violation).  Anyway, he's a violent mfer who will keep pushing the boundaries as long as he thinks he can get away with it. When he and I separated, I predicted everything he would do and I begged the court to listen. He has done everything I said he will do. I know this man very well.

We have almost 50/50 split custody of our daughter (she spends more nights at my house so it's closer to 60/40). She comes home with bleeding diaper rashes, open sores on her neck and in sensitive areas, bruising on her thighs, bruises around her rib cage that are very clear hand prints, she's hungry, her diaper is full to the max, rashes all over her body, and he won't treat her very easily treated eczema. She's usually filthy, and this goes back to before she could even walk. When we were married he would shake her, get angry so fast when she would cry and refuse to feed her until she ""changed her attitude.""

Whenever I file a police report or an abuse report, he will file one right after me to make it seem like we're just going back and forth. The police Dept knows me by name at this point and nobody is taking me seriously. Not even the child protective services.

I have filed 2 child protective orders. One last year when she came back with bruising along her tummy. I picked the WRONG attorney for that and he bullied me into dropping the  CPO and agreeing to the parent time arrangement we have now. I filed the second one recently because of the bruises around her rib cage. I took pictures, I reported it to our child protective services (they haven't reached back out either), I asked specifically for a Guardian ad litem to be appointed. We had our hearing recently and NOBODY looked at the pictures I submitted as evidence and they said there was no evidence of child abuse. But you can CLEARLY SEE HAND PRINTS on my baby. My attorney couldn't be there so I asked for and was granted a continuance.

After talking to my lawyer (and 4 others prior to this one because of all the bs my ex is putting me through), he said that this specific commissioner only does what is easy, not exactly what is right. One of the lawyers I worked with before said that they went in for a hearing and the commissioner hadn't even looked at the case prior to walking in the court room. They all pretty much had the same opinion that she's not doing her job and the court cases to prove it but they're scared to do anything about it because of retaliation.

This has been going on for months and the bruises and other marks my husband leaves on our baby are just getting worse. His hearing for the most recent violation will result in jail time and he's terrified of going to jail. I haven't even touched on his mental issues, but he is fucked up in the head. He doesn't even see the same reality that we do, he overdoses on his panic attack meds and sleeps for days, he can't hold a job, he can't find stable living conditions for the life of him,  he's attempted suicide twice while we were married, he was institutionalized the year we met (before we met) for attempting suicide.

Anyway, I'm legitimately terrified that he's going to kill my daughter and himself before his hearing. And the court is doing nothing about the obvious bruises on her body because of how ""back and forth"" it seems with everything my husband is shooting back at me. From an outside perspective, yes, it looks like we're just trying to get back at each other. But if the court would just LOOK at the bruises he leaves on her body and LOOK at the utter bullshit he puts in his police reports and the actual evidence I have to refute it, they would see that he's a fucking psycho who is hurting a toddler.

His lawyer is making me out to be this spurned ex wife who is just filing protective orders to fuck with him. He LIED saying that I had file multiple protective orders for myself in order to get one granted (I filed ONE and I got it) and that I've just been continually filing CPO after CPO and I've only filed two. The first one was dropped because my lawyer at the time was a fucking manipulative dick.

This same commissioner is handling my divorce too.... I don't want that to happen because nothing will be done. There is not ""best interest of the child"" it's ""fastest way to get this off my plate.""

I want to keep my daughter safe. What can I do? I know I can't run away with her. Our next hearing will be via telephone so there's no way to shove the paper of evidence in front of the commissioner/GAL's face and MAKE them look at what he's doing to her. My attorney is floored by what happened because of the overwhelming evidence I have and he intends to make sure everyone looks at the pictures and evidence. I'm just at a loss for how I can protect my child because they've already made up their minds about this whole thing. They continued it as a formality so that I could have representation when they dismiss the damn thing.

I towed my car to Nissani Bro's Hyundai in Culver City on March 16th for service on the engine. They were fairly helpful for a few weeks, but then stopped responding and I could not get in touch with them (left messages, no response, etc.) I assumed this was maybe due to COVID, as businesses are not operating as usual. I was then notified weeks later (end of April) by Hyundai corporate that Nissani Bro's quickly shut down permanently, and towed my car and about 60 others to a storage facility. There were lien's placed on our cars, and there are mounting fees (upwards at $6k) to get them released. **The dealership is claiming the cars were abandoned after giving notice to owners, although we received NONE. Hyundai and the storage facility E3 have also confirmed that others facing this received no notification, and they are fighting with Nissani Bros to try and release the vehicles quickly.**

I am now facing my car potentially being sold out from under me on May 28th when the lien takes affect. I am trying to working with Hyundai corporate to pay the storage fees to get my vehicle released, but they are now claiming I have to work with Nissani Bros...who I cannot get ahold of because their phone is no longer connected and Hyundai corporate is not able to give me any contact information for them.  There are at least 60 other people in my same position, who are having to deal with this disastrous situation during COVID and I think this criminal negligence on the part of Nissani Bros Hyundai. 

The storage place is now asking for **SIX THOUSAND dollars in CASH** (no payment plans, no checks, no credit) to release this vehicle and stop the lien from taking place. There are many, many people who can not pay that outrageous sum who are now at risk of their cars being sold out from under them.

I signed a contracts for 12 months letting. So I move in, and at first everything seems fine.

After some time of this getting progressively worse, with drain flies popping up all over the place, I contact the letting agency about this. To their credit, they sent out pest control who identified the problem (in the overflow drain in the sink) and he applied some cream or whatever and said that should take care of them. Whilst the number of flies definitely decreased after this, it's been at least a week and I'm still finding flies every day in the bathroom as well as the bedroom. At this point, I kinda just want to call it quits on this flat. But what do I do? I've already put down a deposit and one month's rent, as well as installed a modem and signed up with gas/electric.

End of March - Moved Out.

April 27 - Left an email with my property managers. She said she will contact corporate. However, no response back.

April 29 - Contacted property managers. Property managers noted that the security deposited has apparently been mailed out on April 17 and I should wait another week before calling again to resend another check.

May 7 - Still no check. I reached out. Property managers state they will contact corporate office.

May 8 (today) - I reached out to the property manager and she stated that right after I got off the phone with her, she contacted corporate, but she was not able to get in contact.

The name is not a registered trademark, but I have used it commercially and consistently on nearly 80 records and CDs over the years. I first registered a domain identical to the company name in 1999. I was a couple days late renewing that registration in 2018 and someone else bought it. They didn't make contact or build a site at the URL. That all changed a few months ago. They currently have a site that is actively impersonating my business, including content from our old version of the site. They even cribbed an album description that includes my name and where and when I started the business. My email address is even on there. They also set up accounts on social media using the company name, although there is no activity by those accounts. So this has gone from ""I guess we need a new URL, my bad"" to ""this jackass is really making things difficult"" Although we've created a new site/domain, we aren't showing up in google searches, but the squatter still is. There are workarounds to drive traffic, and other steps have been taken, but the problem persists.

Clearly, registering my mark must be done. The lack thereof has prevented me from getting their host to take down the infringing site. But I only have so much money, and don't want to deplete my accounts in these uncertain times. Additional options, as I see it.

I could offer the squatter money to buy the name back. Likely the cheapest option, assuming they would accept an offer under $1k.

I could buy yet another domain name, along the lines of ""real\_\_\_\_\_\_records.com"" The one we're using now probably isn't close enough to the business name.

I can file a UDRP claim. $1500+, but I worry the lack of registered TM could be an issue.

File suit under the ACPA, This is the most expensive route, but I'm tempted by the possibility of the squatter paying damages and losing all the domain names they own.

84,Dog bit delivery man -- what to expect?,1588963861,"Good afternoon, 

Going to preface this with a TL;DR -- Our dog bit a delivery driver's finger. Why is the cost of an average dog bite so high, and what should I expect to pay in terms of damages? Should we communicate with the risk management company? 

Long story:

My dog is incredibly protective since we moved to our new apartment, so we have been being extra cautious. We opt for contactless delivery in every case, and we wait several minutes after their call to get the food -- so our dog doesn't associate someone approaching the new door with a stranger. Unfortunately, our delivery driver forgot an item, and returned to place it as the door was opened. With the driver's hand being directly in front of our dog's face, he bit the driver's finger and ran away.

I mostly needed to preface that to assuage my shame, as it pains me to come across as an irresponsible dog co-parent, and if I didn't provide detail, I probably wouldn't have been able to post this at all. 

I immediately crated the dog and helped administer first aid. The driver was shaken, so I helped him calm down, cleaned his wound, and helped him bandage it. I ensured he had my contact information, I offered the information on our dog's shots (which are kept up-to-date), and I contacted our county's animal control to report the bite. 

When I spoke with my renter's insurance, I discovered that our policy does not cover animal bites. So, at this point, I am concerned because the average price for a dog bite (according to a google search) is in the tens of thousands of dollars. I expected to cover the price of a finger wound, so my first question is: Why are dog bites so expensive?  

My second question is: What happens in the case where the risk management company for the delivery driver demands that I pay tens of thousands of dollars that I simply do not have? For some reason, I doubt that ""reasonable monthly payments"" is in the realm of possibility. Technically, his owner is unemployed due to the coronavirus. 

Finally, should I communicate with the risk management company? As I might have expected, they have been aggressive and threatening throughout the encounter. They called my partner's phone, refused to identify themselves, and demanded to speak with me -- threatening my partner with court when he refused to hand the phone over when they wouldn't identify themselves. (I only identified them by searching the phone number on google after the fact. I am assuming they got the phone number from the delivery app.). Other than the phone call, they have sent a letter seeking ""reimbursement for the cost of the medical treatment and expenses associated with this incident."" Should I communicate and cooperate with them, or what is your advice? 

I apologize that this post ran long -- I am not sure what information is relevant, and which information is not. I sincerely appreciate any assistance.",legaladvice,False,Abx1956,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfz214/dog_bit_delivery_man_what_to_expect/

91,Neighbor is being negligent with tree maintenance,1588963075,"Hello. Here is my current situation.

I am renting a home with a large yard in Oregon. I have an old shed and a chicken coop in my back yard. My next door neighbors have a massive fir and white oak that are close to the property line, with the limbs hanging over our yard about 70/30 compared to what hangs over theirs. The white oak is dangerously close to the main power line and the power line split off that runs to our home. The fir hangs directly over my shed and chicken coop and every fall I am stuck cleaning 100% of the mess left behind by their oak tree. Recently, they had they had an arborist over to trim some other firs in the yard. While the property owners were here (they live a ways away and currently rent their house), I pointed out the oak and fir trees and asked if they could have the arborists trim them back as well. They said OK. I'm not sure if they didn't explain the scope well enough to the arborist or what, but they only cut 2 small branches off of the oak that were on their side of the fence and didn't even touch the fir.  


I guess what I want to know is when the trees inevitably shed branches and they cause property damage, who is liable? Should I try to contact the property owner directly and ask them to have the arborist come back? I suspect they will say no, but if I can document that, if something does happen will they be held negligent? If it comes down to it, I guess I can reach out to my property owner and see how they would like to address it. But they are not financially stable with everything happening with Covid right now.

We have lived at our apartment building in Ottawa since September and ever since the quarantine started a guy on our floor has flown off the handles.

He was always kind of strange but he has completely snapped. One night a week or so ago, we heard him running around and screaming in the hallway and he was knocking on everyone’s doors. I had spoken to him a couple of months ago in passing as I was on my way to work and I guess he remembered our apartment number because he banged on ours for a solid 2 minutes. We didn’t want to engage him at all so we kept silent. Then our doorknob started turning. He was trying to get in and he was shouting that he knows “the guy who lives here”. Eventually he gave up and kept moving down the hall but my girlfriend was terrified. 

The next morning I was taking out some garbage and I got stopped by this older gentleman asking me to call the police because his apartment had been broken into. The crazy guy had kicked down his door in the middle of the night and slept in his apartment. The older man told me he had brain damage and couldn’t operate phones very well so I called the cops and filed a report for the man.

I contacted the property managers and they said they couldn’t evict him because of the quarantine so we just had to deal with it.

2,Ambiguous situation with landlord about ESA?,1588962597,"Hello! I am in a situation concerning an emotional support animal application and unsure how to proceed. 

I’ve been living in this unit, a condo, for about seven months. I have a good relationship with my landlord (a lawyer in another state) and pay my rent on time. The few questions I’ve had, she’s always been very responsive. 

My girlfriend moved in just over a month ago. I spoke to my landlord before she did and we had her added to the lease as an occupant. 

Recently, because of COVID-19 impacting her work and other issues, my girlfriend’s doctor recommended she get a pet to help alleviate some symptoms of anxiety and depression (my GF absolutely loves cats and always lived with them before moving to my city about nine months ago). Unfortunately, my lease has a no pet policy and says they are forbidden. It goes on to say that if a pet is present without written permission from the landlord, we can be fined a great amount. The HOA for this condo complex also forbids pets for renters. 

I thought that was it, so we let it rest. On her next doctor’s appointment she informed him of this restriction and he said we should get an ESA. He wrote her a letter to show our landlord. 

I hadn’t really heard of an ESA before and neither did my girlfriend, but we did a bit research and it seemed like a good option. 

I sent my landlord an email on Tuesday, April 28th, which said:

“I hope you are doing well. 

I am writing to request an accommodation to allow an emotional support animal (ESA) at [x]. My partner has been working closely with her doctor and he believes that an emotional support animal would benefit her greatly. The ESA would be a cat.

Attached is a letter from her mental health professional which verifies her disability-related need for the assistance animal.

Let me know if there is anything else we can do or need to provide.”

Normally I would hear back from my landlord within hours of initiating contact, maybe a day at most. After the above email, though, days went by without contact. On Friday, May 1, I sent her a text message asking if she had received the email or if I should send it to another email address I had on hand for her. She responded a few minutes later with “Got it. Thanks.”

That’s the last communication I’ve had. There still hasn’t been a response to the initial email. 

We’ve since learned that people have abused ESA requests to get animals into places that forbid them, and now I’m a bit worried that my landlord is miffed. I’m fully willing to cover any potential damages the cat might do to the property, and I figured we would work that out in subsequent emails. 

But we just haven’t heard back. Which leaves two basic options, I think — she’s doing research on her end to see if an ESA is mandated and a reply is still forthcoming (and she’s potentially annoyed with me for asking, but what’s done is done I suppose) OR she was a bit late to respond because she was busy and her short text was essentially confirming that the ESA is okay. The latter doesn’t seem very realistic, as my GF and I figured there was some paperwork or modification to the lease that would be necessary, but we aren’t absolutely sure.

We also aren’t sure how to word a follow-up email to her about this, if the former is the case. My GF still is suffering from anxiety and depression and I’m about to start heading into work again after spending the last two months working from home, thus leaving her alone for most of the day since she lost her job. A cat would absolutely make a big difference for her mental health.

3,I believe I was wrongfully terminated what can I do about it? How far can I get with nothing but witnesses?,1588962592,"I'm not sure how much I should or shouldn't share but jokes were made the day I was laid off the jokes making fun of how I wasn't gonna get much done that day. At the time I didn't know what they were talking about until I was laid off about an hour later. They said it was due to covid 19 that I was laid off. I'm an employee that has been there for at the least 3 yrs and I have a higher position than most people that were kept there. I have family that works there and I was told all the problematic people who miss a lot or don't do much in terms of work have not been laid off so it makes me wonder why I was laid off if I can do what those people do? Not to mention some people that were kept are still somewhat new to working there.

My question is how far could I make it in terms of suing for wrongful termination? I feel I was harassed by a family member in a higher position there the day I was laid off he had walked me out but seemed very happy and giddy about my lay off he was also the one who made the joke earlier that day.

4,"There’s someone on Reddit who has been using illegal drugs while working with children, I’ve determined who they are, can I file a police report/what should I do?",1588962562,"So I got in an argument with this person on reddit because they were connecting substance abuse to borderline personality disorder and I don’t like people perpetuating that stereotype even though it has some truth. 

She was talking about having been on a bender for months but when we talked I found out she’s a counselor and she confirmed she works with kids. Based on her reddit profile I was able to confirm who she is irl. I’m confident I’m correct- based on where she lives and where she graduated college, what she majored in, what she does as a job and when she got said job, and how she looks (she posted naked photos of herself on gone wild and they sync up with who she is). 

Also based on her username. I went to the fb groups for her year in college, and found the only person in there who would fit her username etc, the person did the exact major she said she did, has a job as a counselor working with children, username links to her name, naked pics match what she looks like, graduated at the exact time she posted about graduating on reddit, got the exact job at the exact time she posted about it, lives in the same place- basically it all syncs up completely with her reddit profile and I’m positive it’s the same person. I have screenshots of all her posts and comments to me confirming she engaged in illegal activities. I also found her address through white pages and I’m pretty sure it’s correct but you can’t ever fully trust white pages so who knows. 


I was abused as a child. This woman works as a counselor for children. She should NOT be using drugs while doing that job, especially as she confirmed she faked her drug test (she posted about that as well), and I’m really really concerned because as a child who was going through awful things, they need to be around same people. Someone who’s high on illegal drugs at work, shouldn’t be working with the kids. 

What should I do? I’ve blocked her on some accounts but I still have lots of screenshots that are proof she did said actions and I want to contact the local police. Should I just report it to reddit? I was thinking of doing an anonymous tip to her local police department (since I know where she lives) or something. But I know I can’t totally confirm it’s the same person even though I’m confident it is. So maybe I should just report her to reddit?

I know this sounds kind of stalkery but it took me like 20 minutes with google and logic to find all of this and I just really really really don’t like the idea of someone on drugs and unstable working with kids. It’s illegal, and it’s deeply upsetting. If she didn’t work with kids maybe I wouldn’t care so much but she does and like I said, that personally touches home with me because I know what those kids are going through. If I report it to the local police will they be able to do anything? Should I just report her to reddit? In which case how do I do that? 

Can reddit find her irl based on her account and then contact the police from there, or do I have to contact the police as well? 

She’s not just doing weed, she’s on other drugs as well and I just can’t stop thinking about this because I’m so concerned for the children. 

Should I do something? If she didn’t work w/kids I’d find it annoying but not care but I just don’t like that she’s on hard drugs, and faked a drug test in order to work with kids?",legaladvice,False,tossaway-01,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfymxe/theres_someone_on_reddit_who_has_been_using/
5,A certain online retailer is systemically overcharging customers after quoting them a much lower price. What should I do?,1588962474,"This is pretty mundane compared to what's going on in the world, but I know a lot of people who use this book narration service and it seems to me this overcharging is probably widespread and has potentially gone unnoticed by other customers. Beyond getting a refund from customer support is there anything I can do to get this overcharging practice to stop?

I recently placed a small transaction with a major online retailer for an e-book. After completing the transaction I was offered an audio narration of the book for a discount because I had bought the e-book. I purchased through the offer notification and then found out I was charged for the product more than four times the price I had been quoted.

I inquired with customer support and was told that ""Since the title was pre-ordered you were charged the regular price of the audiobook"" no mention of the original price I was quoted. so I was quoted one price and charged a completely separate amount about four times what I was expecting. The kicker was that the amount I was charged isn't even close to the price *after* release, which was about twice what I paid. I feel that I can reproduce these results with any pre-order transaction with their system, so this was no accident.

I'm not sure how detailed I should be, but here's a quick example:

Item's retail price: ~~$49.95~~ $24.58

Item's pre-order offer price (after purchasing e-book): $5.15

Item's price after release (after purchasing e-book): $12.99

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, apologies if this is not the right place to post this but I feel like I could talk about this subject in a couple different subreddits, if not then please accept my apologies.

Here is the backstory:  


I purchased services from a media ""company"" that offers video montages.  
All in all, they made me a montage video using my product and my product only is in the video.  
None of their faces are shown and nothing else but the product and them using it can be seen (and yes them using it shows only their hands)  


Now the trick is that I paid for that video without an invoice or any contract at all (rookie mistake I know) and now they want to Copyright my video that is posted on YouTube only, no TV commercials or anything, YouTube only.  


My question stands here, is there anything I can do against it or can they just copyright it freely since they produced it ? Even though it is my product that is in the video.

Thank you everyone for taking your time to read this, if you need any more information I will be here asap :)

7,Parenting Plan NEED HELP,1588962290,"I will try to keep this as short as I can. My venue is Texas. Long story short: voluntarily allowed my parents to have custody of my son while I got on my feet, now I want to modify our order. 

I need unbiased legal advice. I have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. When my son was three, I was sent to a pain management clinic for endometriosis and put on oxycodone. I became dependent on it, and was much less functional while on oxycodone all day. That made my mental illness spiral out of control. I went to an inpatient mental health facility and did ECT, and during that time my parents called CPS. CPS investigated me, and found no reason to take my child. But, my father is a legal professional and my mother is a teacher, and at the time I was unstable and could not provide for my son the way he deserved. I agreed to allow my parents to be the primary conservators of my son with the understanding this was just until I could get on my feet. Yes, I was stupid to believe them, but I cannot rewind. 

My son is now 9. In six years I got off of the pain medications, got my mental illnesses stabilized, went back to college and obtained my bachelor’s degree, started a new career doubling my income, became completely self sufficient. I have maintained my stability for 3 years. When I got my own place, I moved into an apartment less than 2 minutes of a drive from my parents house. I have seen my son nearly every day for 5 years. I go to my parents house after work everyday and stay until he goes to bed at 8:30 pm. He was spending the night irregularly when it was convenient for my mom or she was in a good mood, otherwise she makes excuses. Our order doesn’t currently provide me the amount of time I do get to see him, so if I tell her the order allows me every other weekend, she argues that the order doesn’t allow me to come over every day to see him and she will happily abide by the order meaning less time with my son for me. 

I have recently been requesting to change the order. I feel as if I am in a good enough position to have joint custody with my parents, with alternating weeks of visitation. However, with my father being a well known legal professional in our county, and my mother’s perception of me, I’m terrified I am going to upset them, lose all of the extra time I have with my son now, and a judge say the current order should stand.

I have drafted the Modification of Custody Order with my suggestion of alternating weeks, and I want to provide those to my parents and ask if we can civilly agree on this. I am prepared for the rejection and outrage from them, and am preparing to hire an attorney. Before I jump into this, any advice? Do I have a decent case? I can’t keep doing what I am doing. My mom and I do not get along, and I need more time with my son.

My A/C in my home wasn’t very cold, so I got this companies number from a friend and they came out to check the unit. The HVAC tech told me I had low freon and so he filled it up. I received a bill within the next week and I paid it.

A month later the same issue popped up, so I called them again and asked them to check for a freon leak. They “looked” but couldn’t find anything and just filled up the freon, I was kind of annoyed but it’s not my area of expertise, so I paid the second bill.

Another month goes by and once again my A/C isn’t cooling very well. I call the same company and tell them I obviously have a leak and I need them to come and fix it. Not fixed once again, so this time I didn’t pay the bill when I received it.

I called a different company at that point and within an hour the new guy took me out and showed me the super obvious spot where the leak was coming from.

Over the course of another month I kept getting bills in the mail and I would call and ask to speak to someone to explain my situation, but somehow the phone operator was never able to get someone in charge on the phone, and I was never called back, despite being told they would pass my message along and my call would be returned.

Over the next year I received a reminder for the outstanding balance once in a while, but they came
less and less often and then stopped altogether.

It’s probably been 2 years and today I got a collections bill in the mail from the original company.

Is there any way for me to fight this? The bill is only $260, but I’m pissed off about the principle of the whole thing.

She was selling some properties her and her ex husband owned. Come to find out, the original owner was their step son who was in jail at the time.  I had no knowledge of this. 

From what we knew, he sold the properties to both of them long before we purchased the home. 

Now that he is out of prison, he is suing (I think?) me, his moms company, and 8 other homeowners in the area that bought homes from the mother’s company. He is saying the sales are fraudulent, because his signature was forged. 

I got the summons today. Kinda freaked out. I figured the person on the summons was the lawyer, so I called the lawyer, and it was actually the dude who got out of prison. I basically asked him what was going on and he told me that the properties were stolen to him and that his signature was forged on the deeds. I was like well, I had no knowledge of that. I just bought the house as a first time homeowner and everything seemed legit. 

He was like no, so and so warned you. I said no.... no one ever warned me about this. And had they, I wouldn’t have bought the house.  He got a slightly hostile, but it ended cordially. 

I’m an idiot for calling him, and had I known it was him, I wouldn’t have. I said sorry to bother him and I hung up. He’s representing himself in this case.

We came to some agreement and waited till the car was fixed. Then the corona virus stoped the work on the car and the mechanic barely just opened up Monday and told me the amount I had to pay to fix the car. I didn’t have the money so I told him I’ll call him back when I did. Today my cousin sent me a very aggressive text saying that if she didn’t see the car today she would reported stolen and say I stole it. I replied saying where it was and told her I didn’t need to be threatens and was over the whole ordeal. Not long after she read my text the mechanic called me saying the car was reported stolen and reported saying I stole the car. What do I do now? How much trouble am I in for this ?

Words were said, bridges were burned, but at the end of the day we stopped talking and our friend groups separated. I didn't think too much about him, and we didn't see each other for a year and a half, until a couple months ago when I was doing routine maintenance for the leasing company I work for and I walked into a house to fulfill a work order and he was sitting on the couch. Turns out he had moved off of campus into that house a couple months prior and he was now one of my employer's tenants. We exchanged pleasantries and I finished the work order, but the next day I was called into my bosses office and told I was put on suspension because a tenant said that I made him feel unsafe. A couple days later they had a meeting with him, he told them about the beef between us, and they decided to let me go because corporate has a policy that if a staff member and a resident has any sort of conflict, they are to fire the staff because of the liability that comes with us possessing master keys and personal information.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue if I was fired with cause. I was never asked to sign any paper work, and I found out about the firing during over a telecom meeting with my boss who just said that 'corporate has decided to let you go'. During my time at my job I always had stellar reviews and performance statistics, and had this guy not made a complaint against me, my bosses were planning on writing a glowing review for me when I applied to corporate after graduation. I am very saddened because I loved my job, but I did quickly move on because at the end of the day this place barely paid above minimum wage.

I asked my dad if I qualified for unemployment, and he didn't think so because I was fired. That being said, he didn't know for sure but he also implored me not to file for unemployment because he was worried that my old job would contest it and I'd be liable for fraud.

34,"[FL] Lost my health ins. 18mos ago, but therapist offered to continue seeing me on sliding scale. Now, after counselor and I both left the practice, the office is trying to get me to retroactively pay the full rate for 40+ sessions; says therapist wasn’t authorized to offer a lower rate",1588959929,"I lost my job and health insurance in January 2019, and was in mental health counseling at the time. I immediately told both my therapist and the administrator that I had lost my insurance and that I wouldn’t be able to continue therapy. My counselor and therapist offered to see me at a reduced cash rate because “it was unethical to abandon a client at a time of crisis.“

I continued therapy for a year, paying the new cash rate each time. After one year though, both the therapist and the administrator left the practice so I was unable to continue there. Now, six months after my final session, the office is calling me demanding payment in full for the remaining balance of the sessions. Apparently, they were attempting to bill my insurance for the sessions over the last 18 months even though I told them I had no insurance, and the insurance company and/or the office is demanding that I pay in full.

The new administrator, who I’ve never met before, says that the therapist and administrator before were not authorized to offer me a sliding scale rate and that I now owe them for services rendered since the insurance company has refused to pay. My understanding was that I was paying a cash rate, unrelated to insurance.

It’s odd to me that it took them 18 months to notice that my insurance hadn’t been paying them, since they had been being paid every week for several years before I lost my job. I’ve paid exactly what the therapist and administrator said I owed for a cash rate; now they want me to almost triple it retroactively.

Am I up a creek here or should I fight?

TL;DR: Lost my insurance. Therapist offers to continue therapy at a lower cash-only rate. Office mistakenly continued to bill non-existent insurance and is now demanding I repay for the sessions at a higher rate rather than the one agreed to by therapist, administrator and me, saying that the therapist and administrator lacked authority to offer me a lower rate.

44,Bitten by a dog! Vet says dog hasn't received vaccines since 2016,1588959410,"Hey Reddit!

Mississippi

TLDR: How to request reimbursement from the dog's owner? I don't know them but I have name &amp; number from police report.

Full details:
I was bitten by a dog on my way home from work on my bicycle yesterday. Police arrived, took my statement and photos on the wounds and damage to my bike a clothing. My spouse picked me up, we rinsed off the wound and I went to the hospital for a tetanus booster, an antibiotic and proper wound care.

Today I called the vet that the police passed onto me as the animal's caregiver. The vet told me they administer vaccines that need annual renewals and this dog hasn't received theirs since 2016. I know rabies is rare but how nervous should I be  (maybe I'll crosspost to askmedical)?

The hospital (all walkins within an hour+ of me were closed) is going to cost me around $500. The dog put a whole in a pair of jeans, approximately $50. Damage to my bike would be about $50. And a new screen for my phone is probably $100. 

Is it worth pursuing reimbursement with the dog's owner? If so, how would I do that? Should I call the owner directly from the number on their police report? Such a small amount doesn't seem worth hiring an attorney, but I'd appreciate any advice you have!

Addendum: this is a nuisance dog. I've called police 4 times previously before for this same animal and never for any other dog in my life.

Im from sacramento county in Ca.  We moved into this house with there already being 2 fences parallel, touching each other really, and now that the years have passed they of course both need to be replaced.  My neighbor cant financially afford it and that's ok, we are willing to cover the costs...HOWEVER...they want to do 16 feet of the fence line themselves, in a very specific style, and not let the contractor touch it.  Why!? I have no clue why but that's what he wants. And he has asked us to pay for the material and that he would build it.  If it was just a normal fence style that is cost effective I'd be fine with that because then I would have the contractor match it but of course he wants this overlapping one that costs a lot more then I'm willing to do for an entire fence line (that I would never see because it's on the side of my house that is honestly not usuable).   That would then make my fence line two different styles and also not finished because he said he wants to take his time on the 16 feet meaning it will never get done.  We are wanting to get a dog soon so if he doesnt fix that portion my dog is going to continously break free.  


Question:

So if we cant come to an agreement on fixing the fence can I legally just replace my fence and leave his untouched and not have to pay half to fix his fence in the future if he decides it needs fixing.  I just really dont want to get done replacing mine for him to then change his mind and want help replacing his side as well, especially if his fence possibly touches my property making me partially required to help with it.

A group of friends and I have rented a house at a New York vacation spot for the summer the past couple of years. It’s not through Airbnb or a similar platform, but a real estate agency basically runs it like they would apartment rentals. The broker shows us places, we picked one we liked for this summer (keep in mind we were looking at places in September 19 for summer 2020). We have a “quarter share”, we have 5 non-consecutive weeks throughout the summer.

One guy in the house (not me) has his name put on the lease (it reads like a standard rental lease other than the fact that it is 5 non-consecutive weeks, no force majure clause) and signs it. We pay a deposit (about a third of the balance), we paid another third in January, and we had our final payment due April 1.

With the COVID-19 crisis abound, we asked that our April 1 payment get pushed to May 1. When May was coming up, it was clear to us this was not getting any better. All of the events for over the summer for this vacation spot were canceled. Multiple people in the house do not feel comfortable traveling to this spot and staying with each other (none of us are related nor do any of us live together in our usual apartments) since we don’t want to be vectors for the disease. Since we only have a week at a time with the house, we can’t quarantine for 14 days after traveling like NY guidelines suggest.

We brought this up to the landlord, asking if he would consider canceling our last payment and only giving us the “weeks we payed for” (July, August and September, and not getting our weeks in May/June), move our lease to 2021, or cancel the lease all together. He has refused, said “being here is way safer than being in New York”, and said we owe the balance no matter what.

I know since my name is not on the lease I’m not really affected, so asking for the guy who is on the lease: do we have any way out of this? It’s really unchartered territory in general, but as long as non-essential travel is banned we don’t fee this entire situation is...right?

It’ll be the same thing with their PPP loan, over 50% of expenses on payroll (in some cases) will be recouped as rent.

64,Is landlord responsible for pest control?,1588958343,"Virginia. 

TLDR; Who is responsible for pest control, tenant or landlord? 

We moved into our current rental in April 2020. The more time we’ve spent here we have noticed whenever it warms up that we have a wasp issue INSIDE the house, we do not have any windows open since moving in, nor do we leave doors open at all. We suspect they are coming in from the attic as there is a door to access it in one of the bedrooms and they’re usually in that bedroom or coming from the bottom of that bedroom door. Window is sealed and in good condition and we’ve also seen wasps go into cracks/spaces on the outside of the house so could be accessing the interior anywhere. 

Today my cat caught a mouse and he is strictly an indoor cat. We do not leave food out at all, we do not have any abnormal amount of trash, literally one small bin in the kitchen which is taken out pretty much every other day and food is rarely put in there anyway. Our trash bin outside is taken every week and is never full. I know that we are not the cause is what I’m getting at. 

This is extremely concerning to me as I’m pregnant and will soon have an infant in the home which I do not want exposed to any of that let alone have to worry that my infant may be stung by a wasp or bitten by a mouse while asleep. 

I want to contact my landlord and ask that it be taken care of but I’m curious who is actually responsible for pest control before I ask the landlord. If I’m responsible then I will be taking care of it myself of course but would definitely prefer not to have to pay to take care of an infestation not caused by me.

68,Insurance companies not in agreement,1588957762,"Awhile back, my parked car was hit in an accident caused by a collision of two other cars. I was not present at the scene so I was not there when my parked car was towed. Fast forward many months, one car insurance company decides that the fault is a 50/50 split meanwhile the other insurance company is denying all fault 100/0. From what I understand, they were negotiating for months regarding the fault, however neither company has budged from their respective conclusions. As such, the company denying all fault said they would go to arbitration so that a third party could have the final say in deciding the fault. 

This is where I begin to become a little lost. Despite not reaching an agreement, the insurance company denying all fault has decided not to go to arbitration. I had thought that the purpose of arbitration was to force some form of agreement. The denying insurance company tells me to contact the alternative company, so I did. This company (50/50) said that they cannot provide any further payment since they had met their conclusion. The same can be said for the denying insurance company- no payment can be made since that they’re, well, outright denying it. So at this point, they are not negotiating and they are not going to arbitration. Can anyone help me with this please? About myself, I do not have any collision coverage under my policy so that was not an option to begin with. I spoke with a representative from my insurance (same as the insurance deciding 50/50) and I was informed that both parties did reach a conclusion (50/50 and 100/0) but they did not understand why there was such a variation in the fault that was decided. They then recommended for me to contact the initial adjusters again to see why their split was found at what it was found to be. This seems useless to me because even if I know why they found the percentages that they did, I can’t do anything to change it. At the end, I was informed that both parties had done what they could despite it not being in my favor.

 which says this:

&gt; Use this form if “Gift” or “Nominal Consideration” is stated on the Deed. Transfer
tax is due on the Value of said property

10. In the event of inclement weather or natural disaster, if the Caterer must cancel this function the terms of Paragraph 6 (a) shall control. However, should the Caterer be prepared in the event of inclement weather or natural disaster to go forward, and it is reasonable prudent to do so, but the Hose cancels, then the damage provision of Paragraph 6(c) shall apply≥ If the Caterer and Hosts mutually agree to move the event to a future date due to circumstances of the inclement weather or natural disaster, than this Agreement will be amended with written consent by the Caterers and the Hosts.

a. Should the Caterer be unable to perform for reasons beyond his control, Caterer shall be obligated to notify Hosts as soon as reasonably possible and shall return advance deposits. Should this occur, Caterer also agrees to make reasonable efforts to assist the Host in obtaining an alternate location for the event, but in no event is caterer obligated to incur costs in providing such assistance. 

b. Host may cancel the event by written notice to the Caterer within a period of 7 days after this agreement is signed, in which event the deposit will be immediately refunded without charge. However, if the date of this Agreement is less than 14 days before the function, and same is canceled even within 3 days of the signing this Agreement, the caterer may keep the Advanced Deposit as liquidated damages.  

c. If Host cancels the event by written notice to Caterer within a period of 10 days of the event date Caterer will be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of one hundred percent(100%) of all the charges set forth in the Agreement based upon the minimum guarantee which Hosts agree to pay. Such amount shall not be payable if by customary and reasonable efforts the Caterer rebooks the facility for the same period of time for a function of equal or greater value.  

d. If Host cancels the event by written notice to the Caterer within a period of 10 prior to and not less than 75 days from the event date Caterer will be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of seventy-five percent (75%) of all the charges set forth in the Agreement based upon the minimum guarantee which Hosts agree to pay.

I can't have them coming to pound obnoxiously on the door and windows every day because she is working nights and it wakes her up. I happened to be in the bathroom when they showed up today and they didn't stop until I was able to make it there. I have made it clear that it isn't my problem to pay the rent to them and that we wouldn't be leaving unless there was an official eviction notice. The person got real bitchy and said okay well I will be back every day to make sure you are still here. I told her I will be here until it is resolved one way or another and that I do not want her to harrass us that way because it disturbs her ability to sleep and explained she is working nights.

87,IT Consultant trying to switch jobs and relocate,1588956144,"I work as a consultant in IT for a small systems integration company in Atlanta, GA. I frequently have exposure to many customers and  technologies as part of my normal workflow.

I'm  currently trying to switch employers from my current  employer to a large defense contractor located in Colorado. Yesterday I tried to provide a two week notice to my employer and they stated that if I were to take this position, I would be in breach of contract.

Their reasoning is that I  have violated the following clause in my employment contract.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3. Non-Solicitation of Customers  
&gt;  
&gt;During the Restricted Period, You shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit any Customer of the  
&gt;  
&gt;Company for the purpose of selling or providing any products or services competitive with the  
&gt;  
&gt;Business. The restrictions set forth in this Section apply only to Customers with whom You had  
&gt;  
&gt;Material Contact during the term of Your employment.

&amp;#x200B;

During my employment with my current company, I worked indirectly for the defense contractor in question \~2 years ago for a period of 6-8 weeks. This contract was obtained by my company as a subcontractor through the company Chef. As I  understand it, the defense contractor contacted Chef to do this work, and Chef subcontracted this work to my employer, who assigned me to do the work.

Because  of this 'material work' that I performed for the defense contractor, they believe I  am in violation of this clause and would be open to legal action if I  were to pursue this position further. I have consulted with my prospective employer and  they recommended I seek independent council, as they believe this would  not hold up and that my company is using this clause to bully me out of accepting a new position.

I've already contacted a few employment attorneys in my area, but I'd like to poll you guys and see what you think before I can get an official answer.

Our leasing agency offered us to renew the lease in April of the 2019 and we agreed knowing we wanted to stay. The lease ends June 30th and (best case scenario) we were hoping to go month to month for a while until this whole virus situation calms down or (next best case) move out once our lease was up. 

When I was looking at our lease to see when exactly our move out date was, I noticed that it stipulates that we must give “proper notice” if we don’t plan to renew. The exact wording:

“This lease will AUTOMATICALLY RENEW for a term of one year + 5% rent increase at the ending date of this lease or any renewal term unless proper notice is given. Proper notice requires the Tenant or Landlord to provide written notice of nonrenewal at least 90 days prior to the ending date of this lease or any renewal term.”

95,Do we have grounds to break our lease?,1588955156,"Hi. So my and boyfriend and I have lived in the same apartment in Albany, NY for two years. Our landlord is not the friendliest landlord but we haven't really had any issues in 2 years. In early March, we developed a mouse problem. Our landlord brought an exterminator out, although we are unsure of her actual exterminating credentials. We didn't ask because we trusted that our landlord was hiring someone legit. But she came in, put some glue traps and poison down and left. The whole process took 15 minutes. Since then, we have had over five mice sightings in two months, and every time it is met with the same response. Send this lady out, she puts some traps and poison down, and leaves. 

Since this is an ongoing issue, we found an extermination company with high reviews and, after seeing a mouse for a 6th time last night, I texted him this morning asking that he use this company instead. I'm not sure if you all need the exact wording of the text, but the jist was ""We don't feel as if the other exterminator is doing enough. We know people who have personally used this company and loved them. Please don't take this the wrong way, but we would really prefer is you call this company as soon as possible to fix this problem."" He responded with ""No way I could take your order on who to use and your command to do it today the wrong way. I will find someone new and schedule an appointment"". We are, frankly, sick of dealing with this problem. We've been really nice about it and it's causing us to feel unsafe in our apartment (the mice not the sassy landlord). 

Here is the issue. We just re-signed the lease on May 1st. We assumed the mouse problem had been taken care of because we hadn't seen a mouse in a couple of weeks. But the new sighting has confirmed that it was not taken care of. There is a clause in the lease that says ""Tenant stipulates, represents and warrants that Tenant has examined the Premises, and that they are at the time of this Lease in good order, repair, and in a safe, clean and tenantable condition."" We would love to break this lease and move at the end of the month, we actually found another apartment down the street from us with a great landlord about an hour ago. But we fear that we don't have any legal grounding to stand on for breaking the lease. But, at the same time, we did see online that NYS has a law that tenants can break a lease if there is a rodent problem that is not being taken care of. 

Additionally, we gave our landlord a signed copy of the lease on April 30th (after having to hound him for a new lease for three weeks). He has not yet returned a copy with his signature on it to us as of today, 5/8/20. Not sure if that matters.

What say you lawyers of Reddit? Would we be able to break the lease even though we signed that the apartment was in livable conditions at the time of signing? Do we have any leg to stand on when it comes to breaking the lease? We are completely kicking ourselves for signing for another year, but we do really love this apartment, weird landlord and all.

AAA wants to deny the claim based on no comprehensive coverage, stating it was an accident and a car did it.

1,Bought a problemed vehicle from dealership. Thinking about legal action. Advice? (WI),1588954719,"Recently, we purchased a used vehicle (Audi) from a smaller dealership/shop, that we had found out of town (70mi) as we have been looking for this particular model and weren't finding many on the market.

Upon arrival the owner informs us of the faults of the vehicle (driver power mirror doesnt move, climate control display has some burn out) and states that they just replaced the intake manifold on it as they tend to have issues with internal valves (keep this part in mind.)

Test drive start, get in and go to start it with keyless start, barely cranked and displayed a battery light. Guys had the car a couple of months so makes sense a battery could be low, but started fine then with key in the ignition. Teat drive goes ok, minor pull but hard to say how the roads are, no real concerns other than a little vibration at stop in gear. Overall we purchase the vehicle.

On drive home, I'm following and I notice that when my girlfriend was changing lanes, her blinker went to right on then left for a couple then right during the lane change. I figured she had bumped it weird or whatever.

Probably the second day of owning it, only driving it about 100 or so miles in total, the battery dies on us at the store. Get a jump to get home and purchased a new battery. We notified the dealership immediately but ultimately I decided it's not a big deal I would prefer a new battery anyways as we had planned on owning the vehicle for a while. The battery was significantly low on electrolyte in one cell. And the seat bolts were rusted down (battery under seat) indicating that the battery itself was not actually inspected.

 During this battery debacle, I had learned that the key for the ignition does not actually go into the mechanism in the door itself.

Back on the road, I noticed that sometimes when you hit the blinker switch to the right, it will flash right once, then go to the left, either fixing itself or mostly staying on left. Only when you lightly press it down, will it fix. This indicates to me a faulty switch internally.

Soon there after, we experienced the wipers come on by themselves, only once, and had the climate control turn on 3 times in a row before it finally stayed off as we had it.

Then suddenly after about 150 or so miles with the new battery, we get a CEL. Pull the code and it is running too lean. Possible vacuum leak. They did replace the intake. I take a look at the intake manifold and notice that the upper housing is adhered with liquid gasket maker, which would not be OEM nor spec as there should be a gasket there.

I have messaged them through facebook messenger only to document our interactions as they have no email listed on their website.

During our conversation I remained professional and left out any personal feelings as much as possible to make the conversation flow. I stated the issues we have been experiencing since the purchase and my concerns with such problems as these were things marked ok or in working order on the window sticker. 

During our conversation it was discovered that the intake assembly was a used unit and states that his mechanic did not inspect the manifold itself because it was a working unit. (How they know I unfortunately didn't ask. )In my opinion, when there is gasket maker where there shouldn't be, you should probably inspect it. I was not happy to learn this information as the condition of that manifold is unknown, mileage, etc. Had the info been given that it was replaced with a used unit, I probably would have declined the sale.

We gave him 3 options. First being a buyback of the vehicle for full price. Second, I would take in for a quote on repairs from an actual certified audi dealership and he would pay for said repairs. Lastly would be legal action. 

He states that he has his policies where he doesnt buy back and doesnt allow others to work on vehicles for him. He is adamant about me bringing him the vehicle so only his shop can repair it, in which, my opinion was not done right the first time and clearly gives me doubts about their ability to actually repair the vehicle properly.

I asked him from our conversation what issues will he be addressing and how will he go about doing so, and will he be offering any short term warranty on the service performed. I have also asked for proof that he can service to audi spec by requesting information on his mechanics certifications in ASE and any other certificates possibly obtained through Audi/Volkswagen making him familiar with their programming in their vehicles. 

I have not heard anything back about the tech. They've offered to come pick it up and service it. Like I said, we don't trust they will be able to since they didn't in the first place. We really just either want our money back or to have it serviced by somewhere that understands Audi's and can give a sense of security behind it.

So with that here are my questions to you guys,

 Do we give them the opportunity to fix it and if it still fails, then go the legal route? What if it fails too far out for any legal action? Do we have to allow him the opportunity to fix it?

 Do we even currently have any leg to stand on when it comes to buyers protections in wisconsin? 

What would be my next steps in legal action? Do I file a complaint with the state? Talk to an attorney? If so, what kind?

My mom died before she could do anything with my dad's life insurance or estate. I contacted the life insurance company and they said since she hadn't claimed it they would disperse it to my sibling and I. 

My family property should have passed entirely to my mom we believe but now she's gone as well. It was 100% paid off. 

My dad and mom both have a couple of credit cards. My dad has one loan that my mom was also on for around 5-7k I think, they owe about $1k in last year's property taxes. 

I have an appointment with a probate lawyer on the 21st but I'd like some advice now if possible. 

The internet is confusing. It says we aren't responsible for their debts but then something else says their estate can be liquidated to pay their debts. We want to keep the property obviously. I don't think It is worth much as it's just a trailer but it is on property, maybe 15 acres. 

Would we have to pay the debts in order to prevent the home from being sold?

We promised my dad we would never sell the property. If we have to pay their debts we will but this life insurance money is badly needed after a few years of struggling.

So my father married his second wife (not my mother) in 2006. In the summer of 2012 she died in an accident.  They didn't have children together. She had a will and let my father the house where they lived, which was entirely hers, some land and most of her possessions as well as money. The estate was probated. My father then died in 2017. As his only son I inherited the house that his second wife left him, the land and money.

My father's second wife had two sisters. Unbeknownst to me, they always suspected that their sister's death wasn't an accident. A few months ago someone who was close to my father contacted them to let them know that my father had confessed to killing his wife. That person never disclosed that to anyone before. I don't know why he waited so long. I was informed by my stepmother's sisters that at the time, the police had suspected foul play in her death but hadn't been able to prove it. Being estranged from my father, I hadn't been told about it at the time. My stepmother's sisters encouraged the man who heard my father's confession to go to the police, and it appears that further evidence that he killed her was found, and that there is little doubt. I don't know what the evidence may be. I do believe that my father could murder someone though.  He was a violent man.

My stepmother's sisters are understandably very upset that their sister was murdered, as I am. They want to sue my father's estate for wrongful death. They say I shouldn't have inherited what he got from their sister and they should get it back. Even though I understand their position, this has me very worried. I sold the house and land but for various reasons I'm not in a position to give them back the monetary value.

15,Breaking Lease Early,1588954125,"Hey Everyone,

Located in Tennessee. Long time lurker, first-time poster. My Fiancée and I are expecting to close on a home by the end of next week, this will leave us with 2 more months on our townhouse lease(ends 7/31/20). In the lease, we are able to pay $500 to terminate early, but it includes the following language “The Early Termination Of Lease requires a $500 Termination Fee and tenant is responsible for the property, utility connection, and upkeep of the property until it is rented by another tenant” sorry for the grammar and capitalization, that is verbatim from the lease agreement. My question is in regards to being responsible until the next tenant, they have multiple units that have sat vacant for months, are they really able to hold me responsible for these items 8-9 months after the termination for the lease? All in all, we are looking at saving $300 by not paying July’s full rent, if they are able to keep me on the hook for multiple months until they find a tenant I’d rather pay the full month's rent in July and be done with it. Let me know your thoughts!

18,Home settlement between my parents,1588953900,"So I'm 16, (can't really do anything myself) but I want to see if I can help my mom figure some stuff out. I live in Florida. Around the time I was born (I was born in 03, we're talking about 04) my parents bought a house. They were married, and both signed off on it. My father had (and continues to have) really shitty credit, so everything was put on my mom. Around 2ish years later, my parents divorced, and during the settlement, the house was split between the two. My mom continued to live in the house with my 3 brothers and myself, paying for it with the 3 jobs she worked to support all of us, while my father moved out and didn't do anything for us or for the home. He's never paid child support, and has openly told me that he never will. What I want to know is if there's any way that legally someone can see that he hasn't lived in the home and hasn't paid anything towards the home, and realize that my mom deserves the home. We're on the verge of losing the home because of economical problems (we bought another home that my stepdad pay's for, my brothers all moved out of the house to live on their own except one, who has to pay for everything except mortgage, etc.) and our only chance of cutting our losses is to sell of the house for a decent price and make whatever we can. The problem is that my father is asking for an ABSURDLY high price (home is worth around 200k because of it's condition, he's asking 280k minimum) and we all know it's because he doesn't give a shit if we lose it or not, he hasn't paid a dime for it. On top of all of this, even if we WERE to sell it off, he would get half of the money, which I see as utter bullshit. 

P.S. If this helps: he said he would sign on giving me ownership if my mom would sign off too, and idk if by me having ownership (or future ownership since I'm not old enough, idk how that work IANAL obviously lol) Thanks for all the help Reddit, I appreciate giving me your time  


TL;DR- Shitty father doesn't wanna sell off house that my mom's been paying for the last 14 years for a decent price.

Unfortunately, they said if we cant find someone, they will help us find it but we have to pay an extra half a month worth of rent per month!

At this point, I pretty much decided its better to just cancel the lease together, but how can we get out security deposit back and not get our credit deducted? Also they stated ""if we dont pay rent, the home owners will take your group to collections, which will affect the whole group"".  Is this even allowed since a global pandemic is happening right now. But it almost impossible to look for people to transfer the lease too.

Since we all signed the lease together, its most likely we have to stay in the same page. What happens if some of us decides to stay pay rent and others don't?

23,Ex-boss threatens to sue over facebook page,1588953596,"Hey guys! Just some back story: I (21M) was fired in January at my job at a small pizzeria in NJ. In my time there i had voluntarily made a facebook page for the business and had it connected to my primary account. Upon getting fired I unpublished the page (which means it would no longer visible on facebook); to my understanding i was no longer an employee of the business so I was retracting my contributions. (After all I did create/own the page). 

So this morning (approx. 5 months later) i woke up to a text from my old boss (50yo M) demanding that i “return the rights” to ‘his’ facebook page back to him or else he will be pursuing ‘legal actions”. (Keep in mind this is the first time he is reaching out to me about this matter and it has also been unpublished this whole time.) And he also mentions that he has consulted with his lawyer and will be sending me a letter. So my question is this:

What ‘rights’ do they have with this Facebook page and what “Legal Actions” can be taken against me? 

Is this just a scare tactic to get me to give the page back?

1.) I was not paid by the employer to make the facebook page.

2.) I created the facebook page voluntarily and put a lot of work into it outside of my work hours.

3.) Nobody has said anything to me about this situation until today.
 
Is this even something you can do? Should I just delete the page? Should I continue to keep the page unpublished? Should I wait it out? Or should I just give it back?

26,Previous landlord trying to take us for more than our security deposit,1588953118,"Pennsylvania, USA.

TL;DR: We were forced to move out 5 days early so our realtor could walk through the house before she left the country. We didn't get out in time and didn't get to clean because they made us move early, and now our landlord kept our security deposit of $1325,  AND is trying to bill us for an additional $2563.51. we agree among ourselves that we should pay for the water bill, trash service, and two additional days of rent totaling $120.  But she also wants us to replace the toilet, tub, screens (that were never used once - ???), pay the cleaning fee, and labor charges which is insane. Isn't the security deposit supposed to cover any cleaning or replacement costs? The tub and the toilet are normal wear and tear.

Long story:
We were set to move out in early March of this year. My husband told our landlord via phone call back in October 2019 that we would be moving out in the first quarter of 2020. She said to bring it up again when we were ready to move out.

We gave our landlord the date of March 14th, and because of our new landlord wanting us to be in On the date that they did, it was actually only 45-day notice. Our lease states that it requires a 60-day written notice but she told us we didn't need to send a letter. That was our stupidity for listening. But it was via phone call. we don't have it in writing but we have a 40-minute call the day that we came out to view the new house. My husband called her on the drive home to tell her that we would be out by mid-march. 

We told her March 14th because that was the ideal day for us with our work schedules and with moving. Everything was fine, she said she was okay with a notice and agreed to March 14th.

Everything had been done through her realtor, Mary. Well Mary decided to go out of the country during that week and could not be present on March 14th for the final walk-through. Our landlord called us back and told us to move out by March 9th instead. she screamed at my husband and said that he was trying to scam her because he gave 45 day notice instead of 60 day notice. apparently when she called the realtor, the realtor flipped out about the 15-day difference which the landlord had verbally told us was fine.

  at this point we had been busting our asses to get out of the house by the 14th. Moving is expensive and we could not afford movers. We were already extending our moving truck a week longer than we had expected because we only have friends to help us move and we have a lot of stuff that was too valuable to throw out. my husband told her that moving it back to the 9th means that it would be a huge challenge for us and we weren't sure if we could get everything moved and cleaned.

At that point she said we should just work on having the house presentable by the 9th and then we could do the walk-through with the realtor, and then we can work on getting things out afterward. The realtor got back to her and said no, the house needs to be completely moved out of and cleaned before she would do a walk-through. but she could only do it on the 9th, because she was leaving for another country on the 10th.she would not do a walk-through on the 9th unless the house was empty. Well, there was no way without a miracle that the house would be empty on the night so she left for Peru. (She was stuck there in quarantine for weeks, lmfao).

Starting on the 9th my husband had daily phone calls with the landlord updating her on our progress.he told her everything that was still left and what we were still doing. We were working pretty much 8 a.m. to midnight, sometimes until 3 a.m., taking carloads and filling up the moving truck for the 45 minute round-trip to our new house. I had developed a major foot injury and could barely walk. My husband was so exhausted he came home and collapsed into bed every night. We were killing ourselves but we were doing what we had to do.

we had already started our tenancy at the new house March 1st and agreed to stay until the 14th so that we could move. We paid for half a month's rent through the 9th in March at the old house since we were technically still occupying the house. we even offered to pay until the 14th so we could continue to move but she said no, we had to be out by the 9th. We did our best until on the 11th, she called my husband and flipped out that we were breaking tenancy laws, we were squatting, we had to be out by midnight. So we literally grabbed our loads of things and had all of our neighbors take them and hold them in their garages and load up our cars. It was complete chaos for that last day but we got everything out of the house. All the cleaning that we wanted to do didn't get done.

Within 30 days of move out per the lease, we received the list of damages. She is keeping our security deposit.  But she wants to bill us for a bunch of things that are not the old tenant's responsibility. can she legally take us to court over more than $2,000 worth of what she claims are damages?

In 2017 I was working on selling a mid-sized apartment building at roughly $15million.

I secured a buyer and put in an offer but then the owner refused to pay us a fee (I believe because he wanted to ""net"" a certain amount) and neglected to pursue the deal with our buyer. Shortly therafter then went into contract with another buyer but that buyer backed out.

Recently, I found out that he went back to my buyer about a year later, and my buyer did the deal with for a lower price than we had originally procured. Obviously the buyer never had any concern about paying use since we had never discussed it with him due to the fact that seller was expected to pay out commission

I have evidence that I introduced the buyer to the deal, Evidence that I showed him the building, Evidence of assembling all Due diligence items and connecting attorneys to draft to contract,

I just wanted to make sure this is the case, and if so I will be dropping both the history class and the political science class.""

Here is the response I was sent: 

""This is correct. If you withdraw today or any time after today, you will be past 60% attendance for the spring semester and **will not have any billing to your financial aid.**""

35,My boyfriend insists on using the state-mandated-closed gym in our apartment building and I'm worried we could be in serious legal trouble if he does so. How valid are these concerns?,1588952469,"My boyfriend and I live in a small, new apartment building that has only about 20 apartments. So far, only 4 apartments including us have moved in. We have a state-of-the-art gym in our basement which is one of the main reasons we moved into this building as my boyfriend is a serious weightlifter and does Olympic weightlifting, which requires heavy free weights, platforms, squat racks, and bench-presses to be done properly. Because of this pandemic, our landlord was forced to close the gym as our state (NY) mandated that all gyms be closed.

My boyfriend has been going crazy not being able to work out for the last 2 months. He's losing all of his progress he's made for over 8 years and is becoming extremely upset, it is seriously depressing him. He found out that an old weighting gym he used to go to is secretly remaining open during this pandemic and he would be able to work out there, however, I have been trying to convince him not to as I am immunocompromised and do not want to risk him (and thus me) being exposed. He so far has agreed but is becoming very frustrated, so yesterday, in a last-ditch attempt to try to get him not to go to that illegal gym, I texted my landlord again to see if there was any way we could use the gym in our building.  He very clearly told us the gym is closed due to state orders. I then asked if we could borrow some weights from it until it reopens and he said ""yes, feel free to go in and borrow them. Just bring them back when it reopens ."" So I said, ""wait, so the gym is still open?"" And he said, ""yes you can physically enter it but you can't use it.""

Anyway, upon hearing that we are actually able to access the gym, my boyfriend has decided that he just wants to try using it in like the middle of the night. Getting a few weights for our apartment is not really sufficient enough for him, although it's still better than nothing. We live in a studio so we don't have room for the equipment he requires. Anyway, I am very concerned that if he does use that gym, him (and I) could get in serious trouble.

37,Listed a home for sale. Neighbors started dumping on the property and telling potential buyers it was a meth house. Property was not sold after a year of listing.,1588952180,"Hello,

I'm wondering if I have any options here. Obviously right now courts aren't going to be processing something like this, but I'm trying to figure out if there's even anything here worth pursuing.

More than a year ago I listed a property for sale. I live in a different state so I can't really do much to keep an eye on it. While there was considerable interest in the property, there were no offers. Finally the listing expired.

During that time I had heard from another listing agent (the listing changed hands at one point at the agency) that it was possible there was someone squatting there. I called the Sheriff's office to have them go out there but never heard anything back and when I called back some days later no one seemed to know anything.

I just recently listed the home again with another agency. The agent went out and spoke with one of the neighbors, who told him that another neighbor had dumped all kinds of crap onto the property, old appliances, random trash, and had even burned trash on the property. At one point they also apparently dug a deep ditch across the driveway blocking access to the property. They said the neighbor had called the police at one point and they had come out and made them remove the appliances they had dumped over there, and I believe fill in the trench they had dug as well.

They also indicated that these people had spoken to anyone who came out to look at the house and told them it was a meth house and all kinds of other garbage, discouraging people from buying the place.

Almost immediately after listing the property again, I received an offer on it for substantially less than listing price.

I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse here or if it's even something worth pursuing. This is a property in a rural area where even several acres with a home that isn't completely falling down will often sell for under 50k, so I wouldn't really expect damages to be anything spectacular.

Near as I can tell the neighbors who were doing this stuff are not the same as the people who submitted an offer. Interestingly however, the owner of the property where those neighbors live (I've no idea if it's rented out or not) as well as the people who submitted an offer for the property I am selling own a significant amount of property in the area. Near as I can tell they're different people, but between them they probably own at least half the properties in the area.

Curious what you all think I should do. We're selling the property anyway because we want it gone in spite of taking a substantial loss on it because we're a few states away and we never really wanted it to begin with, just kinda ended up with it.

Thanks!

Really hoping someone here can help or point me in the right direction so I can get help.

My girlfriend (non-EU) has been living in the UK (London) for the past 8 years and has been self employed for the past 2/3 years. She has an 8 year old son who was born in the UK and is a resident.

Since the Coronavirus she has been unable to work and therefore unable to pay rent. Today, her landlord gave her notice that she has to move out by August the 3rd.

She has no income to pay rent. She has applied for universal credit but this was denied because her visa has a restriction on receiving public funds. Her appeal was also denied.

She's now applied to have this restriction removed but we have no idea when she'll hear back and if she will be successful. If not, then she could be homeless with her 8 year old son.

Is there anything she can do in her situation? It seems crazy to me that she has paid taxes etc since she's been here but as soon as she's in need, the government won't help.

I don't have any idea about the legalities in this sort of situation hence my post here.

Hoping you can help me. I ordered a Alienware/Dell pc back in Jan. When I received it at the end of Jan. / early Feb. there were issues with it shutting down. To keep this short I will say that I have had 6 service calls to Dell. At first they would help with remote assistance but towards the end asked me to ship it back to them for repair. Finally, I get it back but the issues aren't fixed. I spent two hours with someone remotely connecting and trying to fix the issues but they couldn't so they asked me to send it back again. Since I received the computer it has not been working properly.

The thing is, during my first call the customer service guy said no need to send it back and that a technician would fix it. So on and off they tried until they got to the 30 day mark. After that I cannot received a refund.

I want to bring Dell to small claims. I know it may seem silly or irrational but I have a $2300 pc that doesn't work. It is shipped off yet again and they will not give me a refund. I am currently getting a letter of intent drafted so I can send to their legal department (which in itself was a struggle to get an address over the phone).

Do I have any grounds? I don't mind spending another $2000 to prove a point, I just want my refund. I don't think I can go back to Mastercard as the purchase was over 30-60 days. I don't know what else I can do. Any help would be appreciated.

Hi,

Copyrighted music usage is not allowed in created videos as the background unless you have the license to use it for commercial use. Some videos with popular music on the background get banned automatically (in IG for example). 

There are special resources where you can buy royalty free music to use.   
Another way to use music you like is to create a remix, leveraging the Fair Use principle to make it a different IP piece.

As I'm aware it's not an easy process to acquire a license for a popular song because you need to contact either a singer or a manager to use this song, maybe I'm missing something? 

How do you usually tackle this problem when you want to use copyrighted audio?
Is there such thing that automatically generates a remix for a song you want?

I'm going into my third year in college and I've been fighting my university about this for 1 year now. I thought I'd bring it up here in case I can take any legal action against them. Here's the story.

The university I attend was an out of state university when I first enrolled as a freshman. Thus, I paid out of state tuition (nonresident). Of course this makes sense, since my parents pay taxes in a different state, etc. 

But my whole family decided to move with me when I moved for college. They were already planning it, so they settled down in the state of my college around when I started my first year there. They got a job there, bought a house, basically switched everything over to the new state. We figured that the change would be cool to try and hey, after 1 year, I can file for instate tuition since I count as a resident.

This is where things get fishy. After a whole year and my parents filed their taxes in the new state, I decided to file a residency petition at my university. We provided all our drivers licenses, tax forms, etc. We thought that this would be an easy process: get a approved and done, instate tuition!

But I got denied. They said that since my parents moved during the same time I did for college, they said my family moved because I went to college, and therefore didn't qualify.

Obviously, my family got angry because we literally packed up and MOVED everything to the new state. Like EVERYTHING. We live here 100% of the state, sold our old property to buy a new house here... Etc. We've been fighting the university for a year now, and they won't budge.

This is a potential situation I am facing, but not sure if I’m in the right area. I’m in the US, state is Pennsylvania. 

Right before covid-19 became what it is today, I took a job with a vet clinic as a receptionist, one perk is that through studying and working with the vets (basically the vet has to watch you/sign off on doing x, y, and z so many times) you can eventually become like a “vet assistant” and can do more and get raises. The vet is only at our location 2x weekly, and I’m only there one of those days (I’m at my other job the other day that we have a vet in house). It’s probably important to note that this is a wellness center. 

Pre-shutdown, I worked a total of two days: my first one was me getting thrown in with the vet (also the day we found out we were getting shutdown since we’re not considered essential), and the next day was actually us closing down our room. We were told that we would get paid for the first two weeks, and would hear from the company weekly after that about money. I have heard from my boss once, and it was just a general check in. Turns out, we are still getting paid, however not at full rate. We’ve been on lockdown for a while now and I am still getting paid.... however, in doing a lot of thinking, I’m realizing I may not want to go back to this job when the world opens back up. Would there be any legal ramifications of taking the money that I’m getting paid now, and then quitting in a couple of weeks? Would I have to return the money or could I get sued for cashing the checks or anything? This is all aside from the moral debate I’m facing, but that’s for a different sub. (Also probably important to note that I have no way of getting my contracts or anything that I signed until we open again, so I’m not sure what was in there that I signed. I wasn’t intending on quitting, job sounded great, but I know myself pretty well and I struggled with the vet who typically comes to us, and I.... I just am not sure this is the right fit for me.

Based on when the ticket arrived, even if I had mailed it immediately, it would not have processed in time due to the holiday.   


I sent back the check with a letter explaining that I will admit fault and pay the initial fine, but I wanted to dispute the late fee for the reasons above. That was back in mid-February or early March, and I had assumed that was the end of it.   


Today I got another letter from the DMV demanding that 300, and in that letter they state that because I paid, that is an admission of the violation and my correspondence was not even looked at.   


I tried calling the number they provided and was told the same thing. How should I go about getting this bogus fee dismissed? If I can avoid losing 300 bucks I would prefer not to.",legaladvice,False,Darkmetroidz,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfumsk/washington_dc_trying_to_contest_a_late_fee_for_a/

My girlfriend lives in a cheap building in Germantown (philly). There are now roaches she kills daily, about 2 dozen ants, carpet beetles (she doesn’t have carpets), and random other bugs. In all, she has to kill or trap about 30 bugs a day. She has a skylight that’s destroyed and leaks a large amount every time it rains onto her coffee table (usually about half a pot of water each time). She’s been contacting maintenance for months and they’re barely responsive. The landlord (who owns 100 properties) had his nephew come in and ‘exterminate’ by setting up glue traps and said he’d come back once a month. 

She emailed this week and said she wanted out of the lease. They gave significant blow back, saying they had changes in their company, then said she’d have to find someone to replace her, then said they can’t replace her til after covid. Now they emailed and said their family friend, who is a realtor, will charge her one months rent to break the lease, as that is his going fee and he is ‘very good.’ They said in the first year if a tenant leaves, they charge this fee, but after the first year the fee is waived. There is nothing I can see stating this in the lease. They’re now sending hostile emails to her regular questions like today her water was turned off and when she asked, they sent an aggressive email that the city did it for the whole block and she should be thankful.

We are residents of Texas. Vehicle in question is registered in my Father's name, but myself, my mother and him are listed on the insurance.

The Viq was involved in an accident in California and none of us listed on the insurance were driving the Viq. Another person (ViqD) used the vehicle without permission to do so, and they wrecked it. It was deemed 100% their fault. I was in CA at the time and I had driven the Vic there from Texas, but I was not driving during the accident nor was I in the Vic during the accident.

The OD was injured, taken to the hospital. The police came, took the report, faulted ViqD.

ViqD lives in CA, My family and I who are on the insurance live in Texas.

OD was offered a settlement from our insurance company and the insurance company of ViqD, but has not taken it and has instead hired a lawyer. OD had insurance as well and their insurance covered their Medical expenses. He is seeking damages for Pain and suffering.  We were sent an affidavit to fill out, listing all of our assets. This was sent to us from our insurance company from OD's lawyer.

We don't have any assets. We have a mortgage and car payments and my parents are living off what little SSI and retirement they have. I have nothing either. Just debt and a car payment for my own vehicle. All of our vehicles are upside down on their payments as well.

Our insurance company told us not to worry about it and that we should just fill out the affidavit listing all of our debts, mortgages, car notes, ect. and that OD and their lawyer will probably drop the case since we have nothing of value.

I'm not inclined to believe our insurance company, because when this all first happened, they told us not to worry about it and just do what they said.

I'm all for tipping the kitchen out, but an even share doesn't seem fair considering there were twice as many of them working.

I was told by my boss that there aren't any restrictions on tip pools right now because of COVID-19, but everything I find online says that while tip pools are legal, those who provide more service should get a larger share.

He got his two roommates Linda and Noah  (make-up names) who are living in the same house who are both apparently convicted felons and have served prison/jail time. On my bank statements, Linda’s full name is right there clearly with Mike’s “fake Cashapp name”. When I first saw these statements, I knew something was wrong so I contacted Mike but he denied strongly and even showed his roommates saying they did not know anything about it. He said someone had an access to his account too but couldn’t give the proof of it. This happened last weekend. I have reported to my bank and Cashapp everything but still haven’t received any response from them. It has been a week until now. 

So I did a lot and a lot of self research and discovered many evidences. I went in my google account to check the device histories of my emails where Cashapp was required to sign in for the code. They can’t get the code until they have an access to my emails and they had an access to it on their phones. 
 I saw the registered device and tracked it’s IP address. It matched their location and phone carriers. I have printed all evidences, including the texts between me and Mike. He even got his two friends from other states to “request” and “pay” for him from my account. I have contacted them but one of them only replied saying they did not know. Her credit card was linked to my other email. (There were two Cashapp accounts that were linked to my TWO emails) One was under my name and one was with the made-up username. I have been backing and forth with Mike, with him saying a lot of threats like I’m not welcomed to their house if I thought it was them. Saying that I’m dumbass and stupid. Saying I’m a bad friend for asking around. Telling me that I need to do my homework and all that. BUT that’s what I’ve been doing smh and I even screen recorded our FaceTime conversation which was 19 minutes without him knowing a couple of days. He showed a lot of anger in it and said a lot of OBVIOUS LIES saying that Linda doesn’t have a cashapp account or even a phone. He even said he regularly scams people in the video.

I think she may try to anyway.,1588944929,"Just a little background, my mother is about to go through a very hard divorce. This man has put her under huge amounts of debt, has had her sign her name to properties countless times for failed businesses and to his land so he wouldn't lose it when the last recession hit.

 For years, I told her not to be with this man. It ruined most of my teenage years as my mother was very controlling and made me spend years at this man's farm alone each weekend doing farm work or sitting alone in a room with shitty internet and nothing to do. My mother also used any hobby of mine as a way to turn money. She's participated in several types of MLM's and is currently selling Arbonne. She also just started working as an insurance agent. 
My mom has always used money to guilt and control me. She also never educated me well when it came to my education costs, despite forcing me to go to college and threatens to kick me out with nothing to my name if I didn't.
I'm afraid she will use excuses like the time she helped pay for my legal fees when I got into trouble during college (shop lifting and weed, yeah yeah I know, dumb mistakes. I was young and ""rebellious"".)

She is currently already having to hide money in my name to avoid having him take it all during the divorce. She's also told me that she may have to file for bankruptcy when they do divorce. 

Now, she is begging me to help her get a house. I've told her no 3 times now in the span of a week. She starts the conversation Everytime with, ""Please just hear me out, I just really need you to do this big favor for me."" At this point, I'm honestly afraid she may sign everything in my name considering she has all of my info she needs, the only exception being my bank information. She is the type to do this sort of thing. My mother is very selfish, although she tries to make everyone think she isn't by doing tons of ""community acts of kindness"". 

The reason I already know of that are good reasons not to do this: It will hurt any chance of me purchasing my own home in the future. The taxes will fall on my shoulders, as well as any other fees such as utilities, damages, etc. This could become a larger legal matter in a fraud case.

Instead, the land lord said that there is still work being done, and that the kitchen is still off limits, and that the upstairs should be left alone until the floors are finished drying.

99,Friend's husband is a terrible human,1588944199,"Good Morning. Throwaway because my friends use Reddit.

Some backstory: My friend, we will call her C, her sister, and I worked at a local restaurant. The restaurant owner brought a family friend, we will call A, over from Europe to work at the restaurant. A and C started dating after we worked together for a few weeks. He ended up overstaying his Visa but now they are married and have had their immigration interview in order for him to obtain a Tax ID to legally work in the US.

Here is a list of reason why we do not like him:

1) He threw money at me multiple times and asked me to f\*\*\* my t\*ts.

2) He was here illegally for a while (13 months) and was behaving recklessly. Getting pulled over for speeding, having weed, not signaling all in one traffic stop. Doing hard drugs, gambling money he didn't have, starting fights out on public. 

3) Before A and C started dating, he said he was going to find some dumb American girl to marry him so he can stay.... another time, e A and C got in an argument and he told her he would find another dumb american to marry him.

It was almost like he was acting out to push her 

This is what we knew about prior to their marriage. Our friend told us about their wedding 2 weeks before it was set to take place. We warned our friend to not marry him and we spoke with her parents about this and she uninvited us to their wedding, called us backstabbers, etc. We were re-invited 2 days before, but we barely spoke to her.

After they were married, the restaurant owner opened another restaurant and brought A in to be the head chef and manage the business. About 2 months in, the owner and A got in a fist fight. C told me about this the day after it happened and said that it was because A wanted to be paid more and owner refused.

After A was fired for the fight, he moved to NYC because he could not find work in our city. He was constantly overdrafting their joint account (she told us they needed joint accounts to prove they are a real couple). She was forced to move back home with her parents and sister to save money.

Since COVID, he moved into the family home, caused an argument between C and my friend (sisters) and my friend has been bouncing around to friends homes since. Recently, C and A ""needed"" to drive to NYC to ""pick up clothes"" for A. They drove down and back in 1 day.

Now, we recently found out from the wife of the restaurant owner things we had not know before:

1) A was 10s of thousands of dollars in debt to a bookie locally and restaurant owner paid his debts multiple times

2) A was using crack regularly and allegedly got C to start using (we noticed her skin and hair getting really bad but we chalked it up to stress)

3) C is now paying his debts off as well

Prior to meeting A, C was a very independent, go-getter, feminist type. She drank but never did drugs (only smoked pot 1 time in college) and would leave the bar in tears when her sister would smoke a cigarette. She has always been pretty frugal but likes to travel. She is a completely different person now. A shell of herself. She is co-dependent on him. She has turned most of our mutual friends and her family members against my friend and me because we do not associate with A and do not accept him.  And we were right the whole time. This is not something we wanted to be right about!

13,Question about Applicability of WARN Act/Definition of Mass Layoff,1588942064,"This is in the United States, state is Delaware, but I believe Federal Law applies as it is the WARN Act I am specifically asking about.

I work for a well-known corporation at one of their manufacturing sites. As of the middle of March, the Site employed 298 people. Layoffs were announced and they ended up permanently cutting 65 hourly and 15 salary jobs. These layoffs were completed in April. This past Monday, they announced they would be doing another round of permanent layoffs, which we hear will take place in the next couple of weeks. We do not yet know how many will be affected but the group thought number is probably another 60-75 people. 

My question is: From what I have read about the WARN Act, a mass layoff is defined as an employer of 100 or more persons laying off 33% or greater of those persons. What I haven't seen is if that 33% cut has to be in one fell swoop, or if the cumulative number from several layoffs in relatively close proximity can trigger it, as long as the total cuts equals 33% or greater.

The people that got laid off the first round were paid for two weeks, given four weeks severance, and their health insurance paid for 12 months. My feeling is they company did that to avoid any claims and they probably made the people sign something waiving any future claims in order to get those benefits. I am very close to securing a new job that I will be able to start as soon as I am laid off so I will not need 12 months of health insurance. As the new job will be a fairly significant pay drop, I would much rather have the 60 days pay the WARN Act stipulates must be paid if the company fails to provide 60 days notice.

The other question is if one of the three exceptions to the WARN Act applies. The company, while frequently in the news for its struggles recently, is not is such dire straights that it could reasonably be considered a ""Faltering Company"". I don't think they could successfully argue natural disaster, either. The plant is still operational and we are still making products, albeit at a significantly lower volume. The only one they maybe could argue is unforseen business circumstances due to COVID-19, but the industry we primarily supply was already rapidly declining more than 60 days ago.

But it wasn’t always that way and she has up and left me twice in two years at the beginning.

As it stands now we own a decent sized house and all the things that go with it. Our finances are healthy and everything is peaches.

That kind of money isn’t enough to set anyone up for life but I can’t help but think that if she decided it was over that the courts would likely give her the house (which I would finish paying off and upgrading with some trust money ~86k) and then I’d have half of whatever is left to buy my own home. 

So my question is this: is there some kind of paperwork or contract I can have written up that makes it so whatever I choose to invest in our joint assets she’d be required to recompense if she left me? I broached this subject with her after I learned of my inheritance and she seemed receptive and understanding of my paranoia.

21,Unpaid US Speeding Tickets for a Canadian,1588940970,"I am an Ontario, Canada resident with 2 unpaid speeding tickets and a 3rd that is awaiting a court date in the US.

The first was in Tennessee in 2007.

The second was in New York in 2012.

The third was in West Virginia earlier this year.

While I admit that not paying speeding tickets is stupid, I feel I should mention that I'm not some reckless driver. All of these tickets were relatively small fines for going around 10 - 12 mph over the limit, two of which were in mountainous areas where I just got caught going a little too quick.

After the first ticket in 2007, I was told by someone that US speeding tickets didn't affect insurance back home and that as long as I wasn't pulled over in that same state again it wouldn't matter. I decided to take this chance since I felt avoiding Tennessee would be fairly easy. I did this same thing in New York state while obviously taking some more risk. 

Now I can confirm that these tickets did not affect my drivers rating back home as I have renewed my car insurance several times since the first two tickets and have always had a perfectly clean record.

My question is, do states ever write off unpaid tickets after a period of time? Would it ever be safe again to get pulled over in say Tennessee after 13 years without fear of arrest? Or New York state after 8 years?

24,Employer is JUST NOW changing my pay bc of COVID; HELP?,1588940128,"Sorry in advance but i I am writing this on mobile. I am looking for some help on what my options are. 

I work in TX as an outside salesman selling standby generators for residential homes. I started this position in February with an agreement that I would be compensated $500 a week in base pay plus commissions on whatever i sold.

Now I do want to mention that we were the first group to receive a weekly base pay and the more senior guys work solely off of commissions. Also our benefits did not kick in until 60 days have passed from our start date. My start date was Feb 10 and during the months of March and April we were sent out to homes to conduct appointments during the height of the pandemic. I brought the attention to my superiors that we were not insured at the time and asked if the company was willing to help in any way if were to get sick? We(coworkers included) were asking to just have the 60 days waived so we could sign up to be covered in case you know one of us got sick during a pandemic. Short answer is they said no.

Yesterday my boss comes to me and the three other guys who started at the same time as me and wants to meet with us individually. In the meeting he tells us we are no longer going to get our base pay. He wanted us to sign a new compensation plan right there but none of us did and he said it needed to be signed and returned by this coming Tuesday. Now i questioned him as to why this is happening since we previously had an agreement in place and his.answer was bc of covid. I would like to mention that we were an essential business during the pandemic and never closed down once. It also happens that we had sold more units in March and April than the previous year for those same months so I dont understand how he could put the blame on the pandemic when our numbers were better than lst year non-pademic? I then asked him what would happen if we did not sign? He response was we would part as friends.... I asked him what he meant by that  because it sounded like he was going to fire us if we didnt sign? He continued to use the same line until he finally said if i didnt sign they would fire me.
 We are fighting for the base pay because our job has us  driving our cars too two or three appointments a day with many being on average 30 miles away one way. We do not get anything for gas or to maintain our vehicles. 

 So here i am today looking for help with what I could do as his reasoning in my eyes holds no grounds(i.e. We are an Essential business never closed, better numbers than last year) and it sounds like he is try to use coercion via the pandemic to go back on our previously agreed upon compensation andhave us sign a new one. All of us that started at the same time are sticking together on this and would like to know our options.

27,"[PA] Stranger found property, won't return",1588939593,"Location: Pennsylvania

I carried a personally valuable item in my purse for months back and forth on public transport on my commute to school. It disappeared about 3 months ago.  (Presumably, it fell out on my bag, but, under these circumstances, I can't know for sure?)  My name was on it, so I filed multiple missing item requests at the station, at my school, etc., but nothing turned up.

About 6 weeks after losing it, I got a message on Facebook from some man a few towns over that I don't know.  (It's public, has been routinely active from 2011 onward, so I *presume* it's a real one, and matches with someone else's identification).  He told me that he'd found my item on public transport and wanted to return it.  I was delighted and got back to him right away and followed up shortly after with contact info and an offer to pay for the shipping, as well as an offer to meet him somewhere public if that was easier. I also offered a thank you reward for the trouble.  He saw the messages right away (read receipts), but never responded.  

I've been messaging him every ~ 2 weeks with polite reminders asking him to either contact me or mail it, and read receipts tell me that he has seen them, but there has been no response. If he did in fact find it on the train, he's been holding it for over 3 months already.

It unsettles me because it's a personal item and therefore feels violating; it includes info from my finances and mental health.  It is also strange to me 1) that it took him 6 weeks to message me in the first place, 2) that he didn't give it to a conductor for Lost &amp; Found and instead took it home...(??), and 3) that he went silent immediately.  It doesn't add up neatly.  

According to PA Title 18, Section 3924, holding on to mislaid or lost property when you have the identifying information of the owner and, with intent to deprive the owner, do not make reasonable efforts to return constitutes theft.  I care less about whether he is actually charged and more about whether I get my stuff back.

I was advised by family members to file a police report.  Is his Facebook profile and his admission to having it enough info for the police to get involved, or won't they bother?  What recourse do I have with the circumstances handed to me?

28,SERIOUSLY URGENT MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE CASE !!! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME BEFORE I DIE !!!,1588939049,"HI EVERYONE, PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ IT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT! I DON'T USUALLY TALK ABOUT MY PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS WITH JUST ANYONE, BUT IT HAS REACHED THE POINT WHERE I NEED TO, BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IS DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

I'VE BEEN GOING TO DOCTORS, SPECIALISTS AND HOSPITALS FREQUENTLY SINCE EARLY 2016 (approx. 4 and a 1/2 years now) ABOUT VERY SEVERE AND URGENT PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A LUNG CT SCAN AND 2 CHEST MRI's CONFIRM THAT I HAVE TWO LUNG TUMORS (ONE IN EACH LUNG). THEY ARE PROBABLY BENIGN, BUT THEY ARE VERY PROBLEMATIC, CAUSING ME SEVERE SHORTNESS OF BREATH VERY OFTEN. NOT LETTING ME BREATHE, EAT OR SLEEP PROPERLY SINCE 5 YEARS AGO.

I'VE OFTEN BEEN TO HOSPITAL COUNTLESS TIMES OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS, SOMETIMES EVEN IN A FAINTED OR NEAR-DEATH STATE DUE TO A DANGEROUSLY LOW OXYGEN PERCENTAGE IN MY BLOOD STREAM AND TO MY VITAL ORGANS.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 GASTROSCOPY REPORTS CONFIRM THAT I HAVE A BENIGN TUMOR IN MY STOMACH. IT IS VERY PROBLEMATIC THOUGH (FOR THE SAME REASONS MENTIONED ABOVE), SO IT NEEDS TO BE SURGICALLY REMOVED.

I'VE BEEN ON ANTI-ACID MEDICATION FOR 5 YEARS NOW, BUT IT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IT ONLY TEMPORARILY SUPPRESSES IT SO I CAN MANAGE TO BREATH, EAT &amp; SLEEP SOMEWHAT DECENTLY.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE DOCTORS ADMIT THAT THE STOMACH TUMOR IS THERE, BUT THEY REFUSE TO SURGICALLY REMOVE IT, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THAT IT'S CAUSING MY SEVERE AND URGENT PROBLEMS.

BUT FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, THE DOCTORS ARE NOT ADMITTING THAT THE LUNG TUMORS ARE THERE, EVEN THOUGH A LUNG CT SCAN AND CHEST MRI SHOW THAT THEY ARE. I CAN PROVIDE IMAGES OF ALL OF THE REPORTS IF NECESSARY. SO THEY ARE ALSO REFUSING TO SURGICALLY REMOVE MY LUNG TUMORS.

THE CHEST X-RAY REPORT LISTS EVEN MORE LUNG PROBLEMS, BUT THE DOCTORS JUST IGNORED THEM! THEY DOWNPLAYED EVERYTHING DESPITE MY SEVERE SYMPTOMS AND CHRONIC SHORTNESS OF BREATH.

INSTEAD OF HELPING ME, THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO LABEL ME AS HAVING 'ANXIETY', WHICH I DO NOT HAVE AT ALL. I CAN'T WASTE ANY MORE TIME WHILE MY PROBLEMS GET WORSE AND IT TAKES A TOLL ON MY PHYSICAL HEALTH.

THE HOSPITALS HAVE NEVER EVEN OFFERED MY AN OXYGEN SUPPORT MACHINE WHEN I WAS ALMOST DYING AT THE HOSPITAL. I SWEAR TO GOD I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH AND HAVE EVIDENCE FOR EVERYTHING I'M SAYING.

I DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY ARE TREATING ME LIKE THIS. IT COULD HAVE BEEN FIXED 5 YEARS AGO WITH A SIMPLE SURGERY TO REMOVE MY STOMACH AND LUNG TUMORS.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I CALLED MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE LAWYERS, BUT THEY SAID I DO NOT HAVE A VALID CASE FOR MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE !!! WHY NOT??? I OBVIOUSLY DO.

I'M NOT EVEN TRYING TO SUE ANYONE FOR ANY MONEY, I JUST WANT SURGERY ON MY STOMACH AND LUNG TUMORS !!! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BEG THE DOCTORS TO DO AN OBVIOUSLY URGENT SURGERY FOR ME !

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APART FROM THIS PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO ME FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS, I'M NORMALLY A HEALTHY YOUNG GUY (I'M ONLY 29 YEARS OLD NOW). I'VE OFTEN EXERCISED AND MOSTLY EAT HEALTHY.

COULD ANYONE PLEASE HELP ME? OR DOES ANYONE KNOW SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP ME? BECAUSE THIS PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEM IS VERY SERIOUS AND NEEDS TO BE TREATED URGENTLY BEFORE IT KILLS ME.

30,Bullying to criminal harassment?,1588938682,"Hello,

Just wondering for an opinion. If person A wrote a private message that just wasn’t nice (response to a public attack, calling person B unemployed) and person B took that private message to an ethnic community group and plastered person A’s personal and work contact information calling A a racist, then got the entire group to attack person A through private messages - about a dozen overnight . 

The group also claims to have reached out to person A’s employer to get them fired for alleged racism, which was fully through very selective interpretation of the unemployment comment. (As in, we can all see what we want to see when we are set on something even though it may not be reality). 

The group has also said it is continuously reaching out to local media outlets to shame person A for racism.

Is person A justified in calling the police? What is the best way for person A to handle this when 1. They truly were not being racist in the remark (rude 100%, racist, absolutely not) and 2. They are now worried about possibly getting physically attacked by members of that ethnic community, but they were so distraught in the whole thing that they deactivated their social media profile so not much in terms of full evidence. I know that computer forensics could be done, but this is obviously not a case for that.

My boss' girlfriend happens to be the secretary at my place of employment. Due to the C word, I was unable to get materials from China to do my job, so I've been laid off for 2 months now, I'm not expected to return to work until possibly July.

The secretary has repeatedly shorted employees pay checks, messed up W-2's, falsified/removed insurance information, and refused the order of vital materials for work. The day I was laid off, I applied for unemployment benefits. A week later I received a letter stating I was denied. I filed an appeal, it was denied. I called unemployment to find out why, and was told that my employer stated that I did not work at the company from July 2019-December 2019, making me ineligible for unemployment benefits. I was asked if (secretaries name) was my employer, because that's how she addressed herself. They asked me to send them my W-2's for 2018 and 2019, as well as my paystubs for all of 2019. 

After faxing all of my information, I hadn't heard anything from unemployment for 3 weeks, I figured they were backed up and busy, so I called them yesterday to figure out what was going on. I was told that they had received my information, but still had to confirm it all with my employer, but they're still denying that I worked there. I was again asked if secretary was my employer.

34,Boss says I resigned. I never said I quit. Can I get unemployment?,1588937879," 

I work for a small company that is not doing Covid research. They're doing early discovery work on a type of cancer. My boss claims we are an essential business, regardless, under the guise that we are in this group considered essential:

“Businesses, Organizations, and Facilities That May Remain Open. The following is a non-exhaustive list of businesses, organizations, and facilities that are included in the federal critical infrastructure sectors. The Order does not require these businesses, organizations, and facilities to close.

a. The Chemical Sector includes, but is not limited to:

i. Pharmaceutical manufacturers. ii. Chemical manufacturers. iii. Distributors of chemicals and pharmaceuticals” . This is in Maryland. Again, we are not distributing or manufacturing anything. I have texts showing the other bosses discussing how to ""get around the shut-down.""

I had a mental breakdown at work Tuesday due to the stress involving no masks provided and no shift work implemented. I wasn't thinking straight and making mistakes due to stress and depression. I called one of the bosses and he told me to go home and relax, to take a break and he would check on me over the weekend after discussing the situation with my coworkers and other bosses. There are 10 employees and basically 4 bosses.

Tonight I got an email with the other boss sending a letter stating he determined that I resigned. I replied immediately through email that I did not resign. I took screenshots of everything and recorded dates when there would be 5 of us with no masks in a small meeting room discussing plans for the next two weeks as if nothing was wrong with the world.  There are also other violations (OSHA and one related to alcohol consumption).

The bosses come and go to the workplace but the rest of us are there the whole time.

A couple coworkers have come in for part of the day, so I thought that was fine to do. Boss even mentions that he knew I was stressed about the current situation - bringing the virus home to family due to my exposure, a recent death in the family, no precautions taken at work, etc and he writes that he let me continue to leave early due to this, but in the same sentence says it was unapproved. The other employees had been doing it also to reduce exposure.

He also wants to discuss the situation over the phone. Since the other boss turned my words against me, I emailed my boss that I want all communication in writing.

5 years ago we purchased a house. Given the current market (and even prior) the house is now worth less than the remaining mortgage.

My husband refuses to budge, refuses to sell, says he can't afford a loan to pay off whatever mortgage may remain, refuses to move out, says I can move out but he will still only pay for his half as that's all he can afford.

I feel completely overwhelmed. I can't afford to move out and cover rent elsewhere and half mortgage here, he won't move, he refuses to put on market, and situation gets more tense each day.
We have a teenage child who doesn't deserve to live in a constant war zone too.

Surely there must be some kind of way out?

I did try to live as room-mates, but this doesn't help. He refuses to do anything around the house, leaves a mess at every corner and appears to be on a mission to trigger my stress, which I'm sure is his way of releasing the frustration of a failed marriage - but it can't go on.

50,I was robbed at gunpoint while working at a dispensary.,1588932002,"Throwaway account. IDK I've never done this and it's not something I talk about..so please be kind I'd really appreciate it. There is a TL;DR at the bottom. Welp.. here I go. 

On April 19, 2018 I was on my break while working at a cannabis dispensary. I was eating my lunch in my car parked on the property's back lot. It was a daily ritual for me, and we had two armed gaurds on property at all times with monitored cameras pointed inside and outside every which way, so I figured I was safe. 

On this night, I look up from the food on my lap and there's a man in a hoodie standing on my driver's side holding an AK-47 pointing it at my face. I freeze, look back, and there's another man behind the car on the driver's side. The man with the gun tells me to open the door and give him all my things. I open the door but it just so happened my bag with my wallet was inside the dispensary where I work. I told him I didn't have anything and he got mad and told me to get out and lay on the ground. 

Mind you, I'm parked inside a bay out of view of the dispensary cameras. I told myself... if I could just step forward 3 times, I can get into the camera view for sure. I step forward twice and the man puts the gun to my head and yelled at me to lay down on my stomach. I needed to take that last step forward to get in view so I took a chance and did. 

So I'm in view of the cameras, this guy has an AK  held up to my head..I still feel the gun on my head when I sit and think about it... I'm kicking my legs and moving them hoping the gaurd sees movement on the camera monitor and comes outside. 

Meanwhile, the other man is going through my car trying to find valuables. The gun moves to the middle of my back. Guy in the car shines a light towards me and I realize it's my phone. Once they got what they wanted (my phone, makeup bag, and car keys) the man with the gun told me to stay down until they were out of sight. They back away around the corner with the gun pointed at me the whole time. They hop in their car and just like that they disapear.

I run to the back dispensary door which is about 30 ish feet from where this whole incident happened and inside, right on the other side of that door, the two security gaurds are just hanging out like nothing. I freak out, yell at them that I just had a fucking AK to my head and they were just completely clueless. They claim one gaurd was in the restroom and the other apparently didn't see a man holding a fat ass gun to my head on his big ass monitor sitting right infront of his face. 

I go and tell my manager and he tells me I need to inform the police. Police and detectives come, take fingerprints from my car, ask me a bunch of questions, see the video footage of the incident, and send me home. Boyfriend at the time picks me up and there I am left with what I soon learned was full blown PTSD. The anger, the depression, feeling lost, confused, scared, worthless, shaking uncontrollably,social anxiety, the works. My relationship is severely strained due to me being so depressed I would just lay in bed and cry all day and we ended up going seperate ways a little after because of it. 

I left that job very shortly after. I'd say I lasted less than another month. I would constantly break down and cry at work and get panic attacks. My job replaced my phone and re-keyed my car. Other than that I was left completely mentally fucked. I did not start working again for over a year after that due to how bad my PTSD was. Even then I was just doing short hours in a temporary position just to make some cash. I tried going to a lawyer to see if I had a case and he just made me feel like there was nothing I could do even though I was not able to make an income for over a year due to my PTSD and my life had been so messed up from that incident. 

I know a lot of time has passed but this dispensary allowed this to happen to me on their time and their property. I still feel I never got the proper justice for myself. And not just myself, but I want dispensaries to understand how serious the precautions they need to take with security are. 

Since then, that specific dispensary has gotten rid of that security company and switched to unarmed gaurds. They never fixed all the safety violations of the dispensary like replacing locks on doors to make them pass regualtions, or the fact that the layout of the building allowed patients to slip back into the bud bar unnoticed and unchecked by security or front desk. Which is really bad because the patient could be underaged or even worse, they could be trying to rob you at gunpoint. I feel the dispensary and the security company need to take responsibility for what they allowed to happen to me. I just want to know if there's any justice for me, or if my only choice is to seek closure within myself and move on.

TL;DR- I was robbed at gunpoint on work property while on shift. I want to know if there is any legal action I can take towards work or the security company to compensate for the damage this incident caused to my life including not being able to make an income for a long period of time due to severe PTSD.",legaladvice,False,Helpmemoveonkindppl,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfqd0h/i_was_robbed_at_gunpoint_while_working_at_a/

Forgive my grammar and punctuation, injured hand and all. Early this morning while working as a tow truck driver, I injured my hand while loading a landscaping trailer with a flat tire onto my flatbed. I had to remove some railing on the side of my bed in order to safely load it. Some of the railing was diffucult to remove and in the course of lifting up hard, the rail finally popped out. My hand that was gripping the railing came up into the wheel well of the trailer and hit a sharp edge of metal on the trailer. Long shortly short i got a pretty nasty cut along with 95% of the fingernail being ripped off. It was very painful. I was wearing work gloves when this happened. I immediately got on the radio and reported my injury. While there was a lot of blood, i could tell there wasnt anything a medical professional could or can do for me. 

After reporting the injury to my dispatcher, i was told by management over the phone to either finish my shift or head to the emergency room. Long story short i told management that i didnt think either option was appropriate. I will not be going to a hospital and risk corona infection just to be given some gauss and a sick note so to speak. After telling lower management this, i was told to call someone higher up. I did, and given it about 2 am local, they didnt pick up the phone. No biggie. I will be expecting a call at a more reasonable hour. 

My end goal here is just to get back to work quickly. I dont think i will be able to for a day or maybe a couple, and i have no problem going to an urgent care clinic when they open. I have absolute confidence given how crucial my hands are to my work that the doc will write me a note recommending a little rest. But now im worried i might get fired for not immediately booking it to the ER after being told to go. Even scarier is being let go in a way that would make me ineligible for any type of benefits like unemployment. Im on comission, and with the slowdown im pretty much at minimum wage as is, so it's not the end of the world, but i really just feel like i need a day or two before i can just wrap this hand up and start taking calls again. Am i screwed? Did i shoot myself in the foot? Any input appreciated. Again, totally willing to go to a clinic in the morning to have a doc check me out.

I am a college student renting for the first time, so I'm not really experienced with how all this service request stuff is supposed to work. 

Last winter, we had a mice issue. We called the property owner and sent in the work order. It was taken care of quickly and we didn't see them again until this January. We called and had them set traps and it was caught. However, shortly after this, more mice were seen running around. We repeated the process. No mice were caught. 

In March, I saw more mice and reported this. Someone came out to set traps, but after coming home from a trip to find droppings everywhere, I didn't feel comfortable staying in the apartment and I stayed with friends until a mouse was caught. I explained this to the property manager and asked if there was a way for them to reimburse me for the time I had to stay out of the apartment or the time I would spend cleaning up after it (it also chewed on the walls, doors, and desk in my room). I received 25 dollars in credit for laundry. 

Shortly after I moved back, I heard more scratching and kept seeing things out of the corner of my eye. For a month, I thought I was being paranoid, as I called in again and they said the traps haven't caught anything. However, today while I opened my oven door, I saw another mouse run between my feet and into my living room before making a dash for the hallway closet. I don't understand how they could have not caught these mice already, especially when I asked them again last week to set up more traps because I heard and recorded the mice chewing on the wall behind the oven again.

68,[Tennessee] unemployment appeal advice former employer filed an appeal (not the employer I was laid off from),1588925330,"[Tennessee] former employer (not the one I was laid off from) is appealing my unemployment

I left an employer a year ago, took a new job and unfortunately was laid off due to the current situation. My past employer is now denying my unemployment (not the employer that laid me off)

I left this particular employer because I was constantly being cursed out being called a stupid, bleeping (insert F bomb) bleep (insert a word rhyming with witch) on a daily basis. This went on for 10 months before I couldn’t take it anymore even with the owner of the company sitting there that’s how one employee was allowed to talk to people and the owner did nothing to correct their behavior. 

5 days before I quit the owner of the company shot off fireworks directly behind me while I was outside on my break causing me to lose my hearing in both ears for 24 hours and still having hearing loss in my right ear a year later. I do have doctors documentation of this fact even though I didn’t file for workers comp. In fact when I said it messed up my hearing I was told to toughen up and shake it off.  

The constant stress of always walking on eggshells not wanting to get cussed out was causing me daily migraines, anxiety and depression.  I would literally come home and cry every night. It was taking a tremendous toll on my mental health. I also have an extremely painful autoimmune disease and the stress was causing repeated flares which resulted in significant amounts of pain and inflammation in all of my joints. It was taking a tremendous toll on me mentally, physically and emotionally. 

When I quit I had been screamed at and cursed out 3 times that day. I finally said enough is enough. I packed up my desk, clocked out and walked out. I got in my car and I drove off. I found another job less than a week later so I never filed for unemployment. In fact this is the first time I’ve ever been on unemployment so I’m really confused as to why my former employer was notified of my claim. 

When I was asked on the unemployment application on why I left this said employer I stated I left voluntarily and then they asked the reason and I stated due to working conditions. I felt like it was a very unsafe work place and I had no choice but to leave. It was clear the owner had no control over their employees and didn’t care. It was also clear the owner had no regard for their own actions and no concern when someone loses their sense of hearing due to their negligence. 

I also found out after I quit that in the handbook by failing to give a 2 week notice that I agreed to allow them to withhold my final paycheck which is illegal. I sent a formal demand letter and also called the US Dept of Labor who called them and told them to pay up. I got my final paycheck a week after I quit and 3 days after our regular pay date.  I feel like this should automatically disqualify their appeal because they are in violation of the FSLA and also forcing employees to forfeit their right to employment at will while allowing themselves to remain at will. It feels like indentured servitude not employment at this point. 

How worried do I have to be about this appeal? I feel like I left on grounds that were valid and any reasonable person would not accept the treatment I was receiving and so were other employees. Has anyone else been in similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice anyone has would be greatly appreciated.

I've tried throughout the years working with her,  but the side comments, snips, and constant well I'm going to ask so and so continues.

Well last week I had to have a meeting as I had to fix a data file and get things back running per management that has been down a month. Well, since program changes I had to redo much of the work had issues, and did a group meeting as others asked me to. During that meeting I presented much of what issues I had, advised I had to make these changes if you wanted it to work this weekend. No hiding, took a day off and went back to work. By weds email sent out from the team lead to whole team accusing me of sabotage etc., which now affects working relationships.  Previously I have made several complaints of being excluded as always holding things on my day off with her excuse of only time available. Management allows her to get away with this, and she knows how to have other back her up on the team.  I've gone to senior manager but this is still keeping me up at night as she continues to keep digging but in a side manner which many males don't pick up on, so she can get away with it.

What do I do? Should I make it a point on my day off to re-talk to my manager advising that this isn't settle and he needs to do more, as right now she has all the power.  I cannot work for a vindictive person but this isn't the first time a bully was able to get away with things scot free with him.

71,"current crisis prohibits me from using leased dormitory, would like to know possible remedy regarding my security deposit and/or admin fee if there are any",1588924688,"tl;dr below

I am supposed to move in on the 15th for my review classes in June. However, due to this health crisis, I will not be able to leave my province due to the enhanced community quarantine (the leased space is located in another region next to mine and there is still no assurance when the quarantine ends because of extensions). In addition to this, my review school will be conducting online classes instead (for the first &amp; the mean time) which defeats the purpose of my lease. Since we believe that physical classes will be more effective for me, my parents decided that it is better to take the next schedule of review classes and licensure exam. This confirms that I will no longer need to lease for the said period (May-Nov). 

The company offers six month lease contracts (May-Nov/Nov - May) for reviewers. We are still looking to the possibility that they may allow the application of the deposit and the fee for the next period (Nov-May) although there's a small chance. 

Here are the significant provisions in the contract regarding this: 

The LESSOR shall have the right to forfeit the Security Deposit in the event that the LESSEE unitarillt pre-terminates or abandon this agreement prior to its expiry without prejudice to the other remedies accorded by law to the LESSOR. The Security Deposit shall act as Reservation Fee prior to actual contract date. If in case LESSEE decided not to continue the lease prior to contract date, said security deposit shall be forfeited in favor of the LESSOR. 

In case of back out, pre termination, or forced termination of contract, Lessee agrees that the said admin fee will be forfeited in favor of the LESSOR.

The LESSOR shall not be liable for any injuries or damage caused by any circumstances of force majeure. Force majeure is any event beyond the reasonable control of either party including, but not limited to, war, whether declared or not, rebellion, fire, flooding, and other natural calamities.



I am aware of the contract and have read the clauses properly but I am not sure how it will be applicable in this crisis which we have never encountered in years.

76,Property management screwed me over,1588922182,"So around February, I moved into a room that was being rented out. Long story short, the owner of that house hustled me and sold the building 2 weeks later and I was told I had to move out. I was pissed, but the company that bought the house offered a package that, according to the contract, would be $5000 if I moved by the end of April. 

But to avoid paying rent at a place I would no longer be living in, I ended up moving out on March 31st. But the first bullshit they pulled was saying that the contract was for $5k divided between all the roommates. Luckily for me, there was only one other roommate. So I could deal with $2500.

But my other roommate not only stayed, but he didn't pay rent for the month of April. I literally helped him move out at the end of April. They payed him the full $2500.

Now I waiting for my check and come to find out...they're going to deduct HIS non-payment of rent from MY paycheck. HOW DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?!?

82,Do I have any grounds to demand compensation?,1588921360,"First time posting here, just thought I'd check to see what people think before proceeding, strap in, because the list of events is a bit long. This is involving Centrelink Australia, and a debt that I feel was wrongfully placed on me.

**June 2019**
At this point in time I am a jobseeker, but am looking to recommence study that I had deferred from. Given how late in the year it was, I was planning on commencing in Semester 2. I contact Centrelink to discuss my plans, and ask how the process of switching from Job Seeker payments to student payments work. They tell me they could organise it over the phone. I give them the details, specify I'm commencing in Semester 2, give them the unit code, and apply for a start-up loan. They approve the payments. I ask when I can expect them to go into effect, and they say ""Immediately"". 


**July 2019**
I get an email stating I have received payments I was not supposed to receive, and that I owe the money back. The reason given was that I was payed semester one payments when I was not studying in semester 1. I made it clear this was the case, and made sure to triple check it with the operator I spoke to. He assured me the payments were accurate. I immediately called and filed a dispute, and providers detailed account of what happened with names and dates included. An investigation was lodged, and I was told I would hear back from them soon.

**September 2019**
The payment date for the debt approaches, I have heard nothing back. I call again and ask for the progress of the investigation. The operator tells me it has not yet been looked at, and that these things take time. She puts the debt on hold for six months.

**Remainder of 2019**
I call every so often to check the progress, each time I am told no progress has been made.

**February 2020**
Again, the payment date approaches and I call to see what is happening. The operator tells me the dispute has likely been forgotten about, and lodges a new dispute to increase visibility. She puts the debt further on hold until May 12.

**May 8, today**
The day approaches yet again, and I hear nothing back. I call Centrelink. After being on hold for quite some time while the operator reviews my case, he makes a most interesting discovery. This whole time, the debt that I had disputed, the debt I had called numerous times about, the debt that had been put on hold three times and resubmitted...had been *sent to the wrong department.* He filed yet another dispute and sent it to the *proper* department this time, and told me to wait for the investigation to finish. Where have I heard that before?

In conclusion, I'm sick of being jerked around over a debt that was given to me entirely because a Centrelink employee didn't do their job properly. Not only that, but I've been waiting almost a year to have it resolved, only to find out that it was sent to the wrong place. 
I stand by that I shouldn't need to owe this money considering I'm in the right, but now I feel I should be compensated for nearly a year of being screwed around, tossed from one department to the other, constantly calling in to check the progress of the claim, only to be told that nothing has been done about it this whole time.

84,Just discovered my manipulative father's 3yr+ affair; Mum just put his name on the deed,1588921038,"Hello all,

Sorry if this is a little long-winded, but I will try to compress everything and only convey the necessary facts. My parents just ended a 3 week long argument over cheating allegations and suspicions my mother has held for some time. She, in the past, received numerous phone calls from several people hinting that he was leading a double life, but she has always chosen to stay. He is emotionally manipulative and has been for as long as I remember. Even now, he keeps bringing up ""fond memories"" of her father, who passed away in June, and all of the things he ""used to"" buy for her, and how they ""used to"" fly business class anywhere. I keep using ""used to"" because for the past 12 years he has done absolutely nothing financially, or otherwise, for our family. A couple of weeks ago, my mum became very cold to my dad, and any time they would talk, it would end in shoutings, denials, and his threatening to leave the country. My mum forgave him two days ago and sent us a text along the lines of ""marriage is hard, please don't be mean to your father."" And my sister and I were just done. Even if the cheating allegations were simply allegations, she had PLENTY to be angry with him for. Over the past few years, we have moved three times, with the last move being to a different state. He had not been there for any of these moves, and everything fell on my sister's shoulders while I was away at college. During that time, my grandfather fell quite ill (Parkinson's) , as did my grandmother (Dementia), so my mum had to make several trips abroad to take care of them, usually accompanied by my sister. All this time, my father was ""working"" in a different country (I put working in quotations because nothing, financially or otherwise, has ever come from this work). My grandfather passed away in June, and despite my mother being heavily upset with my father for not being around/there to offer comfort, she happily jumped back into his arms after he did the bare minimum of helping organize the funeral. All seemed to be going well until the end of April, when this fight happened and was seemingly over. Even after it ended, my father's behavior did not change. He'd order my mum around, make her get him food, despite being literally inches away from the kitchen, and just treating her as the house help. Well, my sister and I were not satisfied with the resolution, because where there there's smoke, there's fire. My sister was able to get into his Whatsapp messages and we now have hundreds of pages of damning screenshots dating back to 2017, when I was getting moved into college, of him texting with this other woman. When I say damning, I mean it is 100% undeniable that he had/is still having (as of March 1 2020, after which he deleted messages) an affair. It was so disgusting. We went through all of the screenshots, highlighted dates and everything. He texted the other woman on all of my parents' anniversary, even the 20th anniversary that he forgot. In 2017, when I was shopping for my dorm, he texted her pictures of us and the things we bought and promised to buy her the same things, even bigger and better. He texted her pictures and videos of the new house my mum built, and she replied with how she wanted to ""visit and meet us."" He texted her during the time my grandfather was ill and my mum had to take time off work to travel abroad to take care of him. He texted her pictures of my sister's graduation and she asked him to congratulate us. My mum, we believe, knew something may have happened, but is completely unaware of to what extent. We plan to present all of the evidence to her tomorrow after she comes back from work. This is where it gets messy and I would like some legal advice. The day after my parents' blow up and the fight ended, my mum put my father's name on the deed to our house as a guarantor. He had brought up during their fight of how he felt like he ""didn't belong"" and that his name wasn't even on the deed (emotional manipulation at it's finest). And I am so angry with her for giving in and doing this, then having the audacity to be angry with us for not forgiving him as well. She has $451k in her 401K, in addition to other stocks and assets, and she also recently bought him a Rolex. He does not work or live in this country, and is just a frequent resident, but his citizenship is to another country. For every financial aid form I've filled out, we only report her income as she has pretty much been a single parent. They were also not married in this country, but my mum is a citizen here and lives/works here. In the case that she decides to divorce, what can be done to ensure this leech does not claim half of her possessions? He has contributed 0% to this house my mum built, our schooling, and anything else of the matter.

85,Signed a Two Year Agreement but want out ASAP,1588921021,"TEXAS

Last year, I signed an agreement with my current company. I'm truly tired of numerous things, including how my bosses have talked to me. I am unsure if I'm able to get out of the contract, because the language is very confusing. 

The last stanza of the agreement says, 

""By signing below, you also indicate your acknowledgement that you shall at all times maintain
confidentiality ofclient names, records, lists etc., and your agreement not to use this information for your
own benefit or the benefit of another person or firm either during your employment or after your
departure. You agree to a minimum 2-Year Commitment and if you decide to part ways from our firm, you will give no less than a 30-Day Notice. You agree not to solicit business from or provide services to clients on our client list for two years after you departure, whether or not you have worked on those accounts. ""

From what I understand, they are requesting a 30 day notice, but when I asked my boss about this clause before signing, they said, ""[it refers to] after the two years, as we will spend a significant amount of time training you"". Am I being tricked, or am I essentially being enslaved to the company? If so, is that allowed, are there ramifications to trying to break this?

This is my first time claiming a dependent so I wanted to have it done professionally so I didnt screw anything up. After meeting with one of their "" tax professionals"" and being happy with my claim, they attempted to efile it. The main reason I wanted to efile is because I didnt have the money right then to pay for them and they were going to take the fees out of my return. My return was rejected due to my dependent being accidentally claimed by my fiance, we filed separately. I was told they could paper file it but the money would be due that day or that I was welcome to leave and come back when it was figured out. My fiance submitted an amended return and I was waiting to see if I would still have a job before I spent a weeks paycheck doing my taxes by paper. Ended up losing my job and I saw the tax deadline was extended so I figured I would wait a little longer to see if/when I can return to work. A month after my initial visit I found out the ""tax professional"" used my previous information to efile my taxes without claiming my dependent. My address had also changed in that timeframe and they used my old address. So when I finally got my federal return it was about 5000 dollars short. I never gave them permission to do this or even file my taxes.  Of course the tax professional took her 500 dollar tax fee that I never agreed to. This also affected my stimulus payment as it was mailed out to an old address. I have my mail forwarded to my new address but I read that irs mail may not be forwarded and I still havent received anything. My state taxes never showed up either.

Saturday i went to my local hospitals ER (after a call with my mental health councelor we decided to have me go there to fast track me to the local mental health clinic to get meds faster for my depression.) It was taking a while and i started having an anxiety attack. I got to a room and after being in there a while it got worse and i couldnt handle it. I was texting my husband and he told me to talk to the nice nurse (or at least i thought was nice) to see if she could give me something for the anxiety. Well when the nurses came they were rude and dismissive and told me they wouldnt give me anything and i had to figure out a different way to cope. So that made it worse and i was getting more upset. So i said that since i came voluntarily that i wanted to leave then. They refused saying they couldnt let me leave cuz i selfharmed that morning (which isnt policy btw[and since i stated that i never have and didnt and dont want to ever kill myself they were supposed to let me go; i found that out from a social worker at the hospital a few hours later). So i got more upset and just closed my eyes and screamed and then took a deep breath. Aparently security thought that was a threat and then said i spit on the nurse and hit the staff (i did not and that was proven when they didnt charge me). So then they grab me to trying to restrain me which then creates a ptsd panic attack from being raped before. So the guy security guard (there was a man and a woman) starts trying to throw me to the ground (if i didnt hold my ground where he would have thrown me my head would have slammed to the wall possibly breaking my neck.) The nurse then says we can do this the easy way or the hard way. I ask what the easy way is so we can do that. She tells me to lay on the bed. (Didnt matter face up or down [i asked]) so the security guards let go long enough for me to lay on the bed face up. Then the woman grabs my legs (i was not bothered by this) but the man leans across my chest so i cant move it and his right arm holding down my left arm and his left hand pushed my face to the left then holding down and covering my mouth and nose so i could not breath. (I found out the next day from a higher up at the hospital that they should never have done that) Then i started flailing (i also have terrible asthma and my breathing was already bad from the anxiety attacks) while flailing i would be able to move my face away momentarily to yell these things out ""i cant breath"" ""i need my inhaler"" ""i have asthma"" ""i dont want to die""""just move your hand"". And the nurse then used her steathascope and says ""your lungs are fine you dont need it figure something else out"". So then he moves his hand off my mouth and nose to push against my windpipe. It was a couple minutes of that then the security left. I now have some ptsd when men are near me or if people touch my face, head, throat or neck even my husband.

95,Family litigation on abandonment and abuse,1588919244," TL;DR: I'm writing regarding a Family Law litigation issue in Brazil, It's a complex case involving long term mistreatment, Affective/Material Abandonment, and constant abuse of a mentally disabled youth. Looking for serious advice on how to get off this situation and where to seek real help.

Although we are going through a period of contingency and quarantine due to this unexpected COVID-19 pandemic. But once the routine normalizes on a larger scale, it would ask for legal assistance with a deal that should have been in progress since at least 2008. I'll ask that due legal process be done in view of an injunction of this urgent request.

I'm intending to plead, due to affective and material persistent abandonment and if possible: in order to investigate his incomes, the breach of secrecy of his tax revenue of the last 4 years and respective payslips, including from his businesses. Due to misdemeanors motivated by religious fundamentalist sect engagement. Judicial decision for the father to undergo psychiatric expertise and possible therapeutic referral to the conditions: TOD - Opposing Challenge Disorder (CID F91.3) and dissocial personality disorder (CID F60. 2). if possible: change of family for late adoption to another with the same socioeconomic conditions in order to maintain studies in higher education and maintain specialized medical treatment for my mental condition and other physical conditions until I acquire experience to work. and if accepted: later suspension of family power of origin so that instead of compensation for moral and psychological damage, I am in fact placed in a family so that I have support in addition to financial and emotional stable in the long term. There is a very strong aspect involving psychological violence and emotional abuse that prevails in my case. If it is to be classified as an infraction, misdemeanor or crime, as it will be dealt with by the courts, its various implications to be reflected in the sentence, I would prefer that pecuniary and socio educational measures be taken in the foreground.

I am 27 years old, I do specialized health treatment, including psychiatric. I'm diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder depressive type (CID F25. 1) and ADHD. I'm on treatment for at least 10 years. I have lived in countryside in Brazil for two years. My father, who provides for me, is a cardiologist physician. But we still have constant friction for a long time monetary reason.

Here is my account of some of the facts that persisted during the mistreatment suffered in living with my family of origin:

During early childhood until mid adolescence I suffered physical punishment and isolation for hours on end. I suffered malnutrition, depression and child stress since before the age of 6 due to the absence of my father, and even with his relative presence of a few minutes a day at a later time, I had social and material deprivation from him and from my biological mother. During the time I lived with my progenitor, I was the object of constant psychological games and terror besides her and his moral harassment. Together, my immediate family kept my friends and other people away from me with rumors and defamation of these friends and their parents. My parent not only denied the period in which I was punctually sexually molested and constantly emotionally abused by my biological mother, but also inflicted on me discrimination and isolation because of the first signs of my affective orientation being homosexual, as well as intimidation and overcharging for independence without the necessary financial and emotional support in the pre-adolescent period.

I was abandoned in a fundamentalist school on a reformatory like regiment with sporadic monthly visits from family, already at the age of 11 when I suffered enticement and collective rape in the dormitory by 3 other adolescent boys for at least 1 year. Leaving there, I was forced to move from a city with no health care structure and not say goodbye to colleagues and friends for at least 6 consecutive times. I suffered harassment and bullying in some schools and missed the last year of high school by a nervous breakdown. I was abandoned in long-term psychiatric clinics with divergent treatments to my health condition and spent years without clinical improvement. My various health problems were neglected over the years until I recently sought health insurance on my own initiative. I am still the object of constant humiliation and subjugation on the pretext of having tried marijuana even though I no longer have contact or use during those years (since at least 2013). Even though I have been taking treatments and trying to cure my difficulties, he denies my situation and according to him my attitude is bad will and lack of shame.

I suffered insidious discrimination through punitive treatment because I was born a man. Mainly as a man who does not act according to the ideal of dominant male gender role tied to the idea that there is usually a natural role and social forms of behavior for men due to the social stigma in relation to my lack of masculine aggressiveness, disparaging my notion of masculinity.

Domestic violence with regard to controlling, coercive and threatening behavior. The mistreatment of those entrusted to my care and guidance. Any behavior interpreted as inappropriate for any family member and which could lead them to believe that such behavior was considered unacceptable, was seen as a direct challenge to their intended authority. This repetitive and humiliating treatment, which threatens, intimidates, frightens, continually criticizes, devalues efforts in private or even public, and exercises emotional manipulation.

Emotional abuse involving nullifying or demoralizing the feeling of self-esteem and autonomy. Psychological violence based on my gender, resulting in serious harm and suffering through threats, coercion, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, negatively impacting my identity, well-being and dignity. Including violence abuse through verbal and non-verbal language, bullying, stalking, homophobia.

Under a facade that imputes incomprehension as socially accepted violence in this country, through which the prevailing view of the social sphere is legitimized. Being hidden in every action and denied in practice by the observable form of the act. I do not know if it was consciously done in an architectural or rational way. It was a kind of symbolic violence that worked through complicity between the practitioners of the immediate family and their peers, either in their willingness to dominate or a certain willingness to submit on my part.

This covert form of violence was a way of exercising dominance and exploitation over my psychological. Consisting of a dynamic in nuance, easier to apply because it is less susceptible to reproach. Just as the accumulation of power over the other is legitimated by active denial and concealment in subtle signs recognized as legitimate requests for change to behavior that would be accepted by these aggressors.

The financial abuse that occurred was about controlling my access to the family's economic resources in addition to social deprivation in order to reduce or prevent the culturally normal interaction between an individual and the rest of secular society. Consequently, it diminished my ability to support myself, increasing my dependence on the aggressor. My aggressor has made me financially dependent for an indefinite period of time, including reduced access to better education, employment, career advancement, and the acquisition of assets. Even forcing or pressing me to sign documents to open accounts and use checks for his own use and benefit.

My livelihood was placed in a closely monitored grant, avoiding any expense without the consent of the aggressor, leading to **minute accumulation of debt and depletion of any savings. Disagreements over money spent could result in retaliation for additional physical or emotional abuse.**

He is financially able to provide for my needs such as clothing and furniture, but constantly defers expenses other than college tuition, housing, food and medicine. Today I live by myself, have decent housing, minimal food, and medical treatment provided by my constant insistence on sacrificing clothing and furniture. He makes use of psychological games and constant emotional blackmail to diminish these insistence. Today even my first order needs are treated with contempt and constant postponement until their nullity or status-quo. My expenses are taxed as 'stewardship' or 'expense' and he justifies by saying that since he has never had access to such support, even showing conditions to provide, he alters himself and threatens me by saying that this is none of my business and acts with avoidance and rejection of any change to the situation that might favor me. He also avoids issues related to any change in the budget, says that I need to save money (which is not being enough for all the treatments and food needed). I proposed several times to live on a major city here in Brazil so that I could take a shorter professional course and start working but he insists that he would not support me if he left where I am. He makes threats, pressure and blackmail so I won't seek help or leave what he dictates. While any opportunity for financial and social autonomy ever offered was constantly sabotaged at that time.

Due to problems with work justice, my father coerced me into opening bank accounts and signing sales documents for another of his cars. He still uses bank accounts in my name and doesn't give me access to the money in them. Lately my father hangs up his cell phone and does not answer my calls during the week. When I finally **get in touch, he doesn't talk to me for more than 10 minutes on the phone.** When he visits me, sometimes once a month in the city where I live, and when I mention any kind of reconciliation or long-term involvement in trying to appease this conflict, he implies that he now has another family and that I will probably have no inheritance. Concerned about keeping up appearances, my parents preferred to lead a way of life that collaterally impaired my psychological and professional structuring rather than ask for an abortion or even adoption at an appropriate age.

I notified my school back in Feburary about the change so that they could change the name on the commencement, however, even though they claimed the name was changed I am not on the commencement currently.

Furthermore, due to the SS office being closed I was unable to change my name in their system. I sent a copy of the legal document to my school to let them know about the name change but they refused to change it until I got my social security card updated.

Finally, due to the virus we are doing an online commencement. I was not notified by email about this and only managed to find out due to a friend who sent me the website for the marching order. I tried to sign up on that website, but I was told that my account does not have a graduation. I tried emailing graduation at the school but they have not answered my emails.

1,"American in Mexico, finalizing work visa sponsored by place I no longer work",1588918525,"Hi, I hope this isn't a repeat of a previous/similar post. If so, I apologize.

I'm an American living in Mexico, and before COVID-19 hit I was in the process of getting my work visa. My contract states that my place of work will cover all visa-related costs, and my visa was approved on February 21. I was supposed to go to the US and meet with the consulate to finalize the process by April 7. I had an appointment and plans to go in early April, but by that time, travel was restricted and I was unable to leave Mexico safely. Since that time, I've been laid off from my job and I'm unsure if I'll be getting it back or not.

Now, I am starting a new part-time job (still in Mexico) but I still would like to finalize my Visa process. As all costs of obtaining this Visa (a lawyer, all documentation, plane tickets, etc) were paid by my previous place of work, what rights do I have in finalizing that process now that I have been let go? My employment contract includes full coverage of those costs, but my contract was also supposed to last a year. Since my contract was terminated early (though due to no fault of my own) I'm not sure if my contractual rights pertaining to the visa still apply. Plus, they've already spent the money to cover all the costs of my visa, so not following through would be a loss to them, as well as to me if I have to start over again.

TL;DR - Can I still finalize my work visa sponsored by a company I no longer work for? Or do I need to start the entire visa process from the ground-up? Also, due to COVID-19, will the consulate honor my paperwork even though I was supposed to have had my appointment with them by April 7?

2,Reporting Elder Abuse of my Grandmother,1588918413,"This is a tough situation and I’m hoping that I can get some helpful advice to move forward. Sorry if this is long or confusing. I’m able to clarify anything in the comments.

My grandmother lives in her own home (California) and has maintained independence for much of her elderly life. She had a major stroke several years ago that she miraculously survived with only a few residual issues that still linger today, mainly with her mobility. Her cognition is not completely there but I would say she’s at 90-95 percent.

Unfortunately, one of her daughters has been living with her for the last few years. She has been a parasite latched to my grandmother all of her adult life. My grandmother has certainly enabled some of this behavior to some degree. Multiple incidences of theft that have been swept under the rug and she was even briefly charged with elder abuse due to another living situation she was in (long story). They lost their house and were planning to stay with my grandmother just while they “got back on their feet”. This is now several years later and we all see she has no intention of leaving my grandmothers house. This is because she pays no bills, no rent, and barely does anything to contribute to the overall function of the household. She has two young adult children and one very young child, as well as her partner staying there with her. They are running the house into the ground. The condition of the house is dirty, smelly and unclean. She is having to try clean on her own within the capacity that she can, but because she is being forced to clean after EVERYONE, the house stays in a poor state. She has even said she is doing the laundry for everyone in the household. She is constantly being manipulated into babysitting the youngest child when she doesn’t even have the mobility to keep up with her. 

I speak with my grandmother on the phone regularly and others are aware of the situation not being ideal.  However, after today’s conversation, I am feeling compelled that this is situation is now completely untenable. She sounds dejected, hopeless, and so frustrated. She mentioned casually that she is unable to locate her stimulus check and is planning to use the check to pay for new linoleum flooring, as her daughter’s pets and family have ruined it. What really sent me over the edge is that her daughter and her family are not following proper precautions during the current health crisis and potentially exposing her to the virus. She feels helpless in this regard. To me, this is now unquestionably compromising her health and safety. I’m worried there is financial shadiness happening, as well.

I’ve brought this to the attention of other concerned family members and we are now formulating a plan to make a report to Adult Protective Services. How do we lay out the complaint and what else can we do to come out of this situation where my grandmother is able to regain her independence and be free from this horrible living situation? One big concern is that she may refuse any assistance from APS. 

She claims she doesn’t want confrontation with her daughter when her other children bring it up, but it’s no longer a situation that can be ignored.

What are our options here? How can we be prepared for this process?

7,Threatened to be taken to court for rent; please help,1588917544,"I went to a university last semester but had to withdraw due to personal reasons. I shared an apartment with two female roommates, and let them know I would be moving out and would try my best to find someone to replace me. I left in the beginning of October but paid the rent for the whole of October to give some time to find a roommate. When I told them, they were supportive of me and I really appreciated it, but by the time November came around, one of them asked me to cover part of the rent, saying I had to because I didn’t find them a roommate even though I had tried my best to do so. I initially felt obligated to pay them, but I had no money due to paying back Financial Aid, which was the only reason I qualified to rent the apartment. 

By December, they were threatening to sue me, but I didn’t hear back from them again until today, six months later. They messaged me saying that I now owe them about $5000 and I must pay for the stress I caused them and cover the bills for healthcare professionals they sought. The thing is, we never signed a contract saying that I had to pay for part of the rent after I moved out, and because I hadn’t heard from them since December, I assumed they already were able to find a roommate for the Spring 2020 semester. I did say I would try my best to help find someone to replace me, and I messaged as many people I could, but they misunderstood and shifted all of the responsibility to me. They are also now saying that they want payment in two days or they will take me to court and post on social media about me to warn people about me. I’m unsure who they will warn and believe they only want to do this to get back at me. 

I wish I had the money to give to them because I know it’s tough to be in this situation but I really don’t and I didn’t receive stimulus money because I’m a dependent and 18.

8,Could this mean I might be facing a felony?,1588917386,"So, I just wanted to make this clear before I begin. I’m not ignorant to the crime I’ve commit so if I did get arrested for this, I understand why. I don’t want that though so I’m hoping I don’t get caught. 
My friend and I have been shoplifting from Target since November and I have reason to believe they’ve been building a case on us. It’s been well over $5,000 worth. Maybe a lot closer to $10,000 than I’d ever hoped. We had a method; I use a barcode at self check out that’s only worth .89 and pretend to scan most of the items while the friend distracts the cashier by either talking to them or they’d buy alcohol. We had moments where we felt it was a close call with certain comments directed towards us that we thought we were overthinking and we sometimes heard associates communication on the walkie-talkies throughout this entire time. Thinking back I believe it wasn’t coincidence and that it’s definitely been because they’ve been confirming and building a case against us. I know that some retail stores will let you keep getting away until they know you’ve reached an amount that could land you a felony charge. It wasn’t until recently that the comments became more aggressively direct from the associates. We were doing the normal check out thing and I noticed LP with the grey shirt standing and he clearly stated he has his eyes on me into his mic. I had made sure to purchase everything with a target card that isn’t mine but I’m allowed to use it. It’s a family member who lives in another state who wanted to help me live. As we were leaving my friend handed the cashier an item they were fidgeting with mentioning they didn’t want it and the cashier said “because $13 is really worth it at this point” and we left. My friend went in alone the other day to pick up a prescription and maybe another item and someone approached them asking if they needed help and asked “so where’s your friend today?” My friend asked “do I know you? Did we meet at a club maybe?” The associate said “no we don’t know eachother”. My friend walked to another aisle to which LP approached them asking about the bag they were holding (the prescription they had purchased in the store pharmacy) and mentioned very specifically how they’ve been having issues with people not scanning items at self check out. He also asked “where is your friend today? Is that them on the phone?” (LP noticed they had AirPods in) My friend was able to play it cool that entire time. They pay for their item at self check out to prove they didn’t steal that additional item and the sheriff stopped them and asked to see the receipt obviously and he said “good you paid, keep it that way”. Now I’m wondering with all the questions about me and all that, are they going to arrest me on sight? Or do I have to get caught stealing again to seal the deal? What’s going to happen to us? Are we just banned? If they didn’t get my friend then is it me? Or do they want to catch us both together? If there’s anyone that works at Target what does this look like with LP. What can we do to minimize the blow if it’s as bad as we’re worried for it to be?",legaladvice,False,Lil_Freak_,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfnft0/could_this_mean_i_might_be_facing_a_felony/
9,Nurse just berated and embarrassed my fiance who is in critical condition. Please help,1588917154,"So, long story short, but gets longer. my fiance ended up getting a bacterial infection. The doctors were leaning towards a tick bite since I had pull one off of her shortly to her getting sick. Let me be clear. My fiance is an IV drug user. She was prescribed far too much pain medicine for far to long for a back injury, and ended up dependant on the medication. She voluntary stopped going to the doctor herself, and started trying to ween herself off.

Come now. She started getting very I'll, and very dehydrated as she wouldn't drink or eat. We went to an urgent care and the doctor there was informed she was an IV drug user and the doctor said I don't believe this is relevant, I believe we're more leaning towards the bug bite turning to staph, or maybe a tick borne illness which we won't know till we get the tick panel back. 

Well things just went downhill from there. Her labs came back with low kidney function and so the urgent care doc said she needed the ER. She has been very uncomfortable since she has been in there, obviously since they're not giving her the same dosage as she is used to to maintain, but but even when maintaining at home, she was in the same amount of pain. 

Cue tonight. All the nurses have been very friendly and have answered my questions with patience. I happened to be on the phone with my fiance when her nurse walked in, and I was trying to calm her down cause she was breathing to quickly, and they're thinking the bacteria caused a bit of pnuemonia.

While I was on my fiance's cell phone she had me on speaker phone, and the nurse walked in to change her fluids, and I was calming her down and trying to comfort her, and all of a sudden the nurse says hey let me talk to whoever that is and takes the phone and says

 ""I'm gonna be honest with you. She's a junkie and she's coming off dope.. that is why she is so uncomfortable. She failed her drug test for benzos and opiates, (both things that were prescribed to her up until a couple months ago when she stopped going to the doctor during this covid thing, although not the ROA that she chose) and she's in withdrawals. That's why she is so uncomfortable. And I'm telling you this because my husband died of it, and I'm 5 years sober myself. I was a nurse that got caught and had to go through a 2 year drug court/probation period. So she is going through hell right now, but she brought this all on herself.. this infection is more than likely a result of her drug use  (which I was not told at anytime even though the doctors were aware of her being an IV user, they were leaning towards the tick, or the tick bite allowing something in, and EVEN IF IT WAS I don't believe that's relevant to her immediate treatment""

She continued "" she's a junkie and she's going through hell right now coming off her dope and that's why she's going through so much pain, and so I don't feel bad for her, I've been there and I got through it on my own, but she did this to herself by shooting up whatever she could get in front of her and she is really sick and is lucky to be alive. So you can try to calm her down all you want but she's a junkie she's detoxing and this is the best thing for her is her to just lay here and get it out of her system. I'm not compassionate to other drugs users and she's lucky she got a doctor that is that is actually giving her Ativan and 2mg of morphine cause if it were me, I wouldn't have. She's  a junkie so the best thing you can do is leave her here to detox and get this stuff out of her system cause she clearly uses a lot and she just wants to get high so she's lucky to be alive but I'm not gonna be rainbows and Sunshine's to her because i dont feel bad for her cause she is just a drug addict."" 

So I said wow well can you put her back on the phone please, and my fiance was hysterical and felt degraded and what that nurse did was inhumane in the condition that she is in right now.. the nurse said ""they did an echo to look for endocarditis and didnt see any, but she said so they wanna do a TEE and echo the back of the heart to look for vegetations, and if that's the case than she will be in the hospital for 3-6 months and nobody will see her because of the visitor policy and and it won't be anyone's fault but this girl right here. She has a bad problem and all the pain is from the drugs so I don't feel for her""

I told her even when she was using, the pain was still this bad and she was making the same moans and groans before she even came to ER and got admitted, and she had used during all the days prior and was still in this amount of pain because she has abscesses inside of her hip that are not external, right under the tick bit.

I feel like this was totally uncalled for, first off, I called my fiance to talk to HER. I DIDNT call the nurse to talk to her, I just happened to call my fiance's PERSONAL CELL PHONE and when the nurse came in to change her fluids she just jumped in our conversation and started berating my fiance TO ME and embarrassing the SHIT out of her to me without even knowing who it was that she had on my fiance's phone .. I didn't provide a privacy code, and have never talked to this nurse before so it's not like she knew who I was, and she just started rattling off to me EVERYTHING ABOUT MY FIANCE andbhabout how her husband OD'd and she was a junkie to and so when she sees people like this she doesnt try to comfort them because she knows what she was like when she was a junkie. Then starts telling me her brother came back from Afghanistan and is shooting heroin in his neck blah blah....

Long story short, my girlfriend is in really bad shape with this infection, NO MATTER WHAT THE REASON IS I don't believe ANY of that was necessary for several reasons.

1. She has no idea who she was telling about my fiance's PERSONAL life and medical situation. I didn't introduce myself, I simply called my fiance to talk and this girl takes the phone and says go head and close your eyes if you want to rest, I'll talk to him. 

2. My fiance has never denied her drug use during her hospital visit, she has track marks for gods sake and has been honest about everything she uses. And NO ONE has treated her like that, MOST have actually given her info on how to get help, where to go for a needle exchange, and how to try to be as clean as possible. This nurse BERATED AND PHYSICALLY abused and humiliated my fiance to whoever she thought was on the other line, (thank God it was me) and especially with this no visitor policy, she is going through all this by herself and is very confused because of the dehydration, and infection. 

3. Is this anywhere near acceptable? My fiance was hysterical in the background, and it all started because she asked if it was time for her medicine yet, and the nurse went on a rampage about how no its not, you only want it cause you're an addict and that's not happening you'll get it as needed and that's when she got on the phone with me and said I'm gonna be honest with you, blah blah blah.

This was devastating as my fiance is already confused and isn't 100% there during all of this whether it be from the withdrawals or from the infection, but for this nurse to just DOG her and humilitate her RIGHT in front of her face while she is already in VERY BAD CONDITION, to whoever happened to be on the other side of that phone (THANK GOD it happened to be me and not someone else) without asking for a privacy code, without asking who I was, just rattling off all her personal business and deameaning the FUCK out of her all while she lay hysterical in the background. 

Is there anything I can do? She can do? I don't want this nurse ANYWHERE near my fiance EVER again, and i also believe she violated her patient confidentially and violated her basic human rights to be treated humane like a decent human being especially while she lay there ALONE scared and VERY sick BESIDES the withdrawals which is the least of it because she was sick even in the days before WHILE using. 

Please.. someone help me.. I'm so hurt for her. I get it. But I don't believe this nurse who knows nothing about her personal situation, had the right to do what she did, and I also believe there has to be something that can be done.  She was so embarrassed, and scared and hysterical in the background while this nurse dogged her to me on MY FIANCES CELL PHONE!!!!!! I literally am fuming. Please help give me some guidance here whether this was just a shitty human being, or whether she was out of line and/or violated any of my fiance's rights as a human AND AS A PATIENT. AT THE LEAST I don't ever want that nurse in that room again. Ever. But I feel this goes further. 

Sorry for the long read, but I'm fuming right now. I'm literally FUMING. Please help. 

Sorry to if it was a ramble, this has all be very hard, and this did not make it better for anyone for a nurse to make my fiance feel like a giant piece of shit while she is grasping for her life trying to recover.",legaladvice,False,disarmed89,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfne98/nurse_just_berated_and_embarrassed_my_fiance_who/

Management, sometime between Monday and Wednesday put up signs that declared no parking. About the same time, put two conflicting notices in my mailbox which I did not discover until Thursday. It said no parking Wednesday. The other notice said no parking Thursday. To add to the confusion, with words they said no parking on N side of the lot, with a Map, they circled the south Lot. A neighbor took a picture of the sign in the S. of the lot that said Wednesday.

I transferred from one apartment to another in the same complex. Parking is limited to one per residence. I have a parking permit sticker on my dash that was applied and given at my previous apartment with an expiration date of 2021. When I went to the tow yard, I have discovered that the tow was authorized by the maintenance supervisor. Who listed the reason for the tow was ""Permit did not correspond to unit"" He went to my previous residence looking for me (I assume he didn’t have access to my file, but did have access to the parking permit file). They did not call me. On my lease, the following is the only thing mention about parking,   
 

*“Only vehicles with currently valid parking permits issued by X may park in lots located within the X Development. If parking spaces are assigned, Resident shall only park in their assigned space.”*

So my questions are,

1. Did I have a valid permit if it was issued during the previous residence?

2. Does it matter that I renewed my lease 2 months ago, and on the lease it listed the permit number that was given during my previous residence?  Does this make it valid?

3. Did I have a lease, license or easement to the parking space?

4. How much notice am I entitled to? Can they modify the agreement with 1 or 2 days notice? And did they have a duty to ensure that I received the notice? Does it matter that I did not get the notice until Thursday? Does it matter that they went to the wrong apartment to give notice in person?

5. If the parking space was leased to me, did the towing of my car require an eviction remedy therefore causing this to be a wrongful eviction?

6. If my permit was a license, was my parking permit suspended without me having received notice, and is that valid?

7. Do I have a case and what cause(s) of action can you think of? Trespass to chattels, wrongful eviction?",legaladvice,False,HonestEbb3,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfnbu6/is_parking_spaces_leased_licensed_car_towed_ca/
13,How to legally handle someone who actively ignores quarantine and putting others' lives at risk.,1588916768,"Is there a way to legally handle (breaking the lease, sue for damage, everyone leaving and forcing the perpetrator to pay the rent, etc.) a roommate that actively puts others in danger of getting COVID-19?

Here is a list of facts and things that has been happening:

* Living in an apartment with 3 others (so 4 total).
* One or more might be immunocompromised, and cannot risk getting COVID-19.
* All other roommates have been following the stay-at-home order, except for the perpetrator (calling him P from now on).
* When asked not to bring any guests during this quarantine, P agreed (verbally, not written).
* P brought a guest over claiming that the guest has been in quarantine for 2 weeks.
* P asked if they can go back to the guest's apartment for some reason to which we agreed, but P instead went to someone else's place to have a party/group gathering (we know this because we saw P's location on an app).
* P lied to the rest of us and told us they only went to the guest's apartment and back.
* Did not admit about this until we told P about seeing the location.
* P's family member (who P has been in contact with) is a nurse. This person has not been tested yet.

Because of this, the 3 of us (including me) want to leave this place. However, we are not in a good place in terms of money as well (we're all college students).

So we are currently wondering if there are any possible legal actions we can take to either soften up the financial damage or have it completely covered. Thanks!",legaladvice,False,CivicToyota,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfnbev/how_to_legally_handle_someone_who_actively/
14,"Canceling a Lease In Ontario, Canada",1588916152,"A while ago I had signed a standard form of lease in Ontario Canada for a 3 year long period. I had intended to cancel it after a year because I only needed to live there for 8 months. Turns out I had initialed a section in the contract where I acknowledge that in order to set a termination date at August 27th, 2020, I needed to have submitted an ""N9 Tenant's Notice to End the Tenancy"" form by January 15th, 2020. This deadline is yearly, so the next time I could set a termination is January 15th, 2021 to be terminated at August 27th, 2021, forcing me to pay 15 months of rent at a place I am no longer staying at.

The section detailing this was barely a paragraph long and I was told to initial plus write the date just next to the statement, no signature. They just wrote ""There are no exceptions"" and that the N9 form ""must be hand delivered"". Can a landlord even set when an N9 form is allowed to be submitted?

16,Fired during COVID-19 while on paid family leave,1588914941,"Location is Oklahoma. I was employed for two years at the same company. I had an office position and was one of four account managers. 

My daughter has had significant breathing issues and she is only 18 months. She got RSV at the young age of 5 weeks and has had pneumonia two times since. It was so bad at one point that a bronchoscopy with suction was performed about six months ago to see why she wasn't getting better. We have multiple inhalers that she uses daily. She had been going to daycare which, if you are unfamiliar, is a complete cesspool of sickness. It's back to back viruses. It's excessive to say the least but it's a scary thing sometimes. I've got to take care of my family so there was not a way around it.

 Once I heard of the first positive case in the state, I was terrified every time I dropped her off. She would not do well if she contracted COVID. My work is well aware of her health issues and were pretty supportive. A week after the first positive case, I received a call from her pulmonary specialist strongly suggesting she be quarantined for the time being. I said I would need them to give me something formal to cover me at work and they faxed over a document explaining why this was necessary. I was fortunate enough to receive clearance to work from home. No one else was able to; just not enough equipment. I was sent with a laptop (I was missing a lot of tools to do my job) and it was hard with a young one but I made it work.

 Every day my boss was up my ass about something. I didn't clock out as much as the day before. I didn't clock in enough. I got all of my work completed and I really busted my ass to make it work. It was a little nerve-wracking at times because I kept getting bitched at for things that were ridiculous. They knew I had left to take care of my daughter; they wouldn't let me work out of normal business hours but I was required to keep up with the 40 hours a week, I didn't have the equipment I did at the office but they would send me papers to scan knowing I didn't have a scanner. I told my boss my concerns on a few separate occasions and was assured I was doing a good job. I started to get such anxiety. I would wait for the morning email nitpicking anything she could find. They would leave my computer open and watch every move I made. If it weren't moving I had to be clocked out. Where as at the office I could grab a drink or go to the restroom, I now had to clock out. It's really hard to read emails and think about the best angle to reply while people are watching you type and to see if your mouse is still moving. Again a lot of anxiety but I busted my ass to make it work. I lost quite a bit of weight from the stress. 

This went on for two weeks and in the middle of the third week, I called HR and asked that I be given permission to work a couple hours outside of work hours. I was neglecting my daughters needs trying to meet theirs and that's not why I went to work from home. She told me she would talk to my boss. 

I receive a phone call the next day telling me I was no longer able to work out of home and that I needed to bring back the computer. I was not happy but they said I could take a pay cut and they would let me have 12 weeks of paid leave to take care of my daughter. I was gone for one week. Required to call in every morning and tell them why I wasn't coming in. She said they were temporarily bringing someone in to cover my desk. 

This last Monday I was asked to call the office later in the day. I had been on leave for five business days. I called but my boss didn't answer. A minute later I received their call; it was HR and my boss on speaker. I already knew it was not good. They said they had been working my desk and had found a few mistakes. I asked what and she said she wasn't going to go over it but I demanded to know what one of them were. They said I had made a mistake on an account and when they told me the name I already knew what they were talking about because it's a special account. Two years of employment and the owners loving my work. I told them to get to their point and they said I was no longer going to be employed by them. I could tell you why this is a personal Injustice until my face turns blue but I want to know if this is even legal. 

The reason was not substantiated whatsoever, and I was on FMLA (it was paid so I'm not sure what that is called), and I know for a fact that if I wouldn't have left work to take care of my daughter, I would still be employed. Is this legal? What can I do? If this is legal, how is FMLA a protection?

One last really weird thing to add. I had texted HR after the call telling her it was unbelievable and wrong that she fired me while on leave and that I know I would still be employed if I hadn't left due to the pandemic. Fifteen minutes later I get a text from a co-worker saying the lady that fired me pulled her aside and asked if I was ok and to call her next day if I wanted to talk. She said she looked like she was going to cry and it was hard on her. Literally fifteen minutes after firing me but ironically after I messaged her.

19,[CA] Father gave away up to $35k worth of precious metals that were owned by my mother to a dealer without my mother's permission and only receiving 1/3 of the value. Now nine years later we're trying to figure out if anything can be done?,1588914440,"This occurred in 2011 and I live in California.

CONTEXT: My mother owned close to $30-$35k in precious metals (silver coins), purchased after she had gotten married. My father had never contributed his own money to purchase these, it was all purchased by her with her own income.

One morning, while my mother was still asleep, he had taken all of all this without her knowledge and had gone to a coin dealer. He sold it to the dealer and only received close to 1/4 of it's true value. He had no idea how much it was really worth so he accepted it. He acted out of anger since him and my mother were having a huge fight. Expensive mistake...

The issue here was that on the receipt provided to my father, the dealer had not listed all the items appropriately and left out a lot of the coins/bars, making it look like my father had brought in less stuff or only whatever the dealer decided to list. My father was also never told to sign anything. Since metals of this large amount take up so much space, my father had brought it in with large bags. The dealer told him to hand it to him through the door rather than through the window, but by doing this it allowed the dealer to avoid going through each item and register it on the receipt correctly in front of my father since it was ""easier"". So, he got duped without realizing it. We were never able to obtain any security footage without going through court to show this.

About an hour later, he returned to store realizing what he did, but the shop was closed when it should have been open (red flag one). He came again one more time the same day and found them open again, and the dealer told my dad he had already ""sold"" the metals and no longer had it (another red flag).

The only proof my mother has of all her total property are initial receipts of the coins themselves purchased over the long period of time leading up to the incident.

My mother had no idea her stuff was missing until a month later when she went to check on the stuff and it was all gone. She thought we got robbed, but then my father admitted what he had done.

The next day they went to the dealer with my father, approached him and asked to discuss the situation and try to get a return on the property because she did not consent to this transaction since she was the one who purchased all of this for so long. He looked nervous, refused to talk and threatened to call the police...

My mother had home insurance but they said they couldn't do anything since it was a family member that did this.

After consulting other shops we were informed the dealer was supposed to have kept the metals, especially of such value, for thirty days and should have had proper paperwork filled out and signed. Neither of this was done.

Police advised her to take this to court, didn't do anything themselves. However, my father refused to participate because of shame and embarrassment. He promised my mother he would try to pay her back which is why we dropped it. We're trying to see if anything can be done again since that did not happen.

Some Q's...

1. Being in CA, and with her building up this collection with her own money, despite being married, does this make the metals also her husband's property. Did he have any right in doing this legally?
2. Can we classify the dealer's way of handling this transaction fraud since he basically stole a huge chunk of the metals for free and did not pay my father for it (leaving it out of the receipts as a way to make the metals ""disappear"" or weren't involved). 
3. Were the police right in refusing to do anything themselves especially since my mother had alerted how suspicious the encounter was?
4. What can we do? Is it too late to do anything anymore... ?

A lot of details here since I don't want to leave out anything I think might be relevant, so I *really* appreciate you guys taking the time to read through this and offer advice. We're planning to consult a lawyer but also wanted to see what some of you guys would say.

We discovered though that the worker is not a licensed contractor and brought this to the attention of the LL. He admitted to me that he has to use an unlicensed contractor because he will be red-tagged if he is inspected. The home is rural, but not in an area that allows unpermitted construction. The house is very large, tall and extremely expensive to rent. Floor joists are rotten, headers are rotten, parts of the house in danger of colapsing in the opinion of carpenters that have looked at it and declined the job. 

It has been expressed to me that because there is only one man doing the work with a laborer as a helper, that the construction could go on for months. As it sits now we are allowing the construction to continue...but it is a major disruption and interuption to our lives.

9 years ago, she bought a house for $18900 with a little bit of help from me and my brother (roughly $4000). It wasn't anything fancy, a fixer-upper so to speak.

She was required to pay 50% down due to bad credit and other reasons. That all went fine.

She was required to pay the other 50% over the next 6 months.

The only way she could do so was if me and my brother took out student loans. Which we did. It was the only way.

I took out 6000, my brother took out 14000.

Today, 9 years later, I have been 'paid back'. She gave me a car worth about that much that she didn't want anymore. Cool. I'm cool with that.

She still owes my brother 12,000$.

Today, I found out that her offer to let us take the house from her had strings attached. It would still be 'hers' and we wouldn't be allowed to throw away any of her 'stuff' (She's a hoarder.)

Going through a very tough time in my life right now. Had to charge my SO with domestic violence.i have temporary possession of the home right now since I have the kids. I have to decide if I want to keep it. I was approved for legal aid and will get a lawyer next week. But I can't stop myself from wondering. If I wanted to keep our home; we would need to divide it correct? I'd have to pay him half of the value? I have always either worked only part time and just recently began a licenced day home because I always needed to watch the kids. I don't have savings. I don't make a ton of money. Can legal aid help cover your half of the cost or do you need to qualify for half the mortgage through the bank?

33,"[NJ] Discovery from criminal case doesn't include a referenced document, which is required for the evidence to be admissible. What's the best way to find out if it exists?",1588912752,"In a felony case, the police are required by law to obtain a special authorization prior to doing a wiretap, or the wiretap is inadmissible in court. Their evidence includes wiretaps. The discovery includes reference numbers to the authorization for each wiretap. It also includes copies of the authorization forms for each wiretap, except for one. This is odd because (a) the prosecutor's case largely depends on this wiretap and (b) only its authorization is missing. So, most likely, the prosecutor forgot to include a copy of its authorization in the discovery. 

But, what if the prosecutor/police forgot to get the authorization prior to the wiretap?

How would someone find out whether that missing authorization form exists and, if so, whether it was created prior to the wiretap? It's reference number is known so looking it up shouldn't be hard. But asking the prosecutor for it directly may end up tipping them off that they've got a loose thread. At risk of being paranoid, could the prosecutor/detective could create a backdated version of the authorization?

Both over 60, retired and disabled. get about $2500 a month.

Had a house in california which was taken over by my older brother due to their declining health. They move to IL to be closer to him and their grandkids.

Brother sold CA house and paid for IL house which was much less for them and everything was great.

Turns out, that never happened (paying off IL house) and he sold the IL house to some 'friend' and brother was paying mortgage on it.

Brother had $ issues and ran up 30k in CC debt for parents and another similar sum for sister. Wiped out parents savings.

2 weeks ago I get a call asking if I want to buy their house. (He and I dont have a relationship so this sparked red flag #1) And this is when all the information i am sharing has come to light.

Parents live in a house owned by someone else and they are not renting it because they thought it was paid for so there is no documentation. now the home owner wants to sell the house and parents have weeks to move out, no savings, no plan, 30k CC debt. They have lived in this house for 5 years.

I understand that certain things should have been documented, parents are not the best with this stuff thus brother was managing. but now it has come to light of all the mis management.

I am in CA and currently a working full time and full time student so i cant help much.

SIster is in IL and willing to help from that side.

Its tough because they have no rental agreement with the homeowner, 0 in savings, CC debt with nothing to show from it. both in poor health.

41,Best options for recouping the cost of vandalism to my car,1588912011,"I'm using a throw away. I home that's ok.

I was at work tonight when I saw a lady pull into a parking spot. I noticed her but didn't pay much attention until I heard the commotion. She was standing in the parking lot yelling and throwing a cell phone, I couldn't really make out what she was yelling.

I find the non-emergency police number in my phone and dial it. we've had the police out before for odd random incidences. So she keeps telling and getting louder, she was yelling at some man, I'm not sure if they were together.

They tried to come in the store, the lady yelled at me to call the cops, I told her they were already on the phone. She immediately knocked over a stack of baskets and a product display right next to the door. I yelled ""that's it, get out, we're closed""

at first I thought they were having some type of argument about a relationship but the guy got in his car and drove away and the girl just sat down on the sidewalk. At this point the police dispatcher had told me that police were on their way. Things settled down for a few minutes. Another customer came into the store and as I was milling around they told me she was throwing rocks at our company cars. 

I started videoing with my phone. She was throwing rocks from the parking lot at our company cars. Then she turned and started walking toward my car. I kept filming. She threw a rock straight at my car and it broke the little triangle window behind my driver door. At that point I flipped, I went out side and screamed in my deepest voice for her to stop and leave, she leaves the parking lot. I see her walk into the drugstore across the parking lot. 

At this point, I am on the phone with 911, a couple minutes have passed since she went into the drugstore and a hand full of people come running out. She caused some terrible ruckus in the drug store, the police arrived shortly after and arrested her.

The police took my name and info and a statement, he gave me a card with his email and I sent him the pictures of the damage to my car and the video of the woman damaging the cars, I have not received an answer yet but this all happened earlier this evening.

This is the first car I've ever had a payment and full coverage on, I think they might cover the damage but I'm pretty sure my rates would go up and I don't want that. I'm angry as hell about the car but the thing that pisses me off more is the idea of paying higher premiums for something SHE did to ME absent ANY control I would have had over the situation.

Would it be a better route to pay to have the damage fixed out of pocket and just sue her for it? (It's not just glass breakage, there are also big chips in the paint and creased dents down to the metal.)

A few years ago, a truck hit a different car while it was parked in a lot and I wasn't in it. The driver ran off. Long story, none of it matters but i didn't make an insurance claim but I asked my insurance provider if my rates would go up if my car gets totaled in a parking lot like that completely absent my input. He said yes, even in that case my rates would go up.

42,Neighbor is driving me up the (shared) wall,1588911904,"I partially need some kind of legal advice and partially just a sanity check. If I’m just being too petty, please tell me that. 

This all started Summer/Fall of 2019, which is weird because I know this guy has been our neighbor for longer. I have also been pregnant since early September and don’t know what factor that plays (more on that later).

Back story/first interaction is long, but provides a somewhat important backdrop. My husband and I are in our 20s, quiet, and keep to ourselves. On top of that, I started online school June 2019 and find that even music and background tv distract me when I have to focus, so I keep our apartment kind of radio silent intentionally during my schooling. Our neighbor however is a very loud and generally unbothered person in general, he smokes and it reeks in our closets and bathroom which have shared walls, he is constantly hacking up a lung and spitting which I hear all the time, his little dog yaps often, he sometimes goes out to his truck and just revs it late at night with his bright headlights shining in our window, but on top of all of that he plays his tv all day every day at a volume where I can tell what he’s watching from my living room which is on the other side of the apartment from the shared wall, and his tv is also on the far side from the shared wall. 

Late fall 2019 it became too much, he had his door open, tv blasting into the breezeway and I could easily understand every word from his tv for over an hour while I was trying to focus on a paper. I considered just calling the police because I didn’t know him or how he would react, it was past 10pm, and I was home alone, but that felt like an overreaction and I hadn’t even given him a chance so I risked it and went over. He’s a 53 year old man and immediately started making excuses about commercials being loud, and said “What are you trying to go to bed or something?” (Yes.) I tried to be as nice but assertive as possible that commercials were not the problem (I normally just back down in situations like this). I said, “I’m not asking you to turn it off or to a volume where you can’t hear it, but it’s incredibly loud in my apartment, I’ve been hearing it for months, I’m just finally trying to nicely ask you to turn it down a couple notches”. He just acted bewildered I could hear it, turned it down drastically (still loud though to me in the same room as the tv) and said, “Can you hear this??” and I said, “Well...yeah, but if you can’t, you can turn it up, I was just honestly asking for you to turn it down like 2.” He kind of let up, did what I asked, and told me to test it out and let him know. I could still hear it but it was better so I told him that, thanked him, and appreciated that we came to somewhat of a compromise. Then he came over 5 minutes later and knocked on my door... He again asked if I could still hear it and I said “Well it’s a lot better, I do appreciate you turning it down” and then he started asking if we were here for good. Our doormat is another state flag (where we’re from), but I thought he was asking about this apartment specifically and answered that we’ve lived here for 2.5 years. So he asked, “Why don’t you buy a house?” and I said, “Uhh, we’ve got our reasons, why don’t you buy a house?” (probably sounds more aggressive than it was, I was just annoyed that my asking this man I don’t know to turn it down a bit is getting me grilled on major life decisions at 10pm, pregnant, home alone). He started to give me his divorce/home ownership story, but I kept it short and just said “Hey again, I appreciate it, have a good night.” 

Months go by, mostly no problems, but the tv gradually gets louder again. My husband keeps telling me it’s not a big deal, which in a way he’s right (he also isn’t able to hear it as well for some reason, which is why I wonder if pregnancy has made my ears extra sensitive) but it really gets to me that I can’t have a quiet living environment. This is our living space that we pay for, I don’t care what he does, but I don’t want to hear it. So I leave a note on his door, “Hey, we can hear your tv again every day, could you just bump it back down a couple? Thanks! :) -apt #.” He comes over as we’re on our way out to dinner the next night and asks us to come over, has his tv on a very reasonable volume, and says “You can hear this??” So I said, “This? No! I actually haven’t heard anything all day, but usually it’s game shows, Fox News, and booming base” (sounds like you’re in the hallway right outside a movie theater). So he points to his sound-bar and says it could be that, and I was like yes, it’s definitely that. He again tries to blame commercials and I again point out that I can identify the shows he’s watching from the other side of my apartment. He kinda shrugs and that’s all for that interaction, not much came of it. He’s kind of a belligerent person but not outright rude or crazy....or so I thought. 

Another month or so goes by and I’m home alone doing school and hear all of the sudden “n*****!” shouted super loud like 30 times over (my husband and I, and this neighbor are all white). By like the 10th time I’m honestly not sure where it’s coming from, thinking it could be from above me or outside, after like the 20th I’m concerned it’s a real altercation, someone is in danger and I need to call the police, but I wanted to identify where it was coming from first. So I stick my head out the door, don’t really hear anything, and then fully step out to see if it’s outside but distant. Well....this dude steps out into the breezeway too. Crap. He looks at me and questions why I’m out there and then thinking he came out to check the situation out too I said “Did you hear yelling too? Do you know what’s going on?” And he said “What!?” Very angrily. So I said, “Were you....yelling? Is everything okay?” And he. went. off. “Mind your business you stupid bitch.” I literally threw my hands up and said “Woah, I was just wondering...” and he cut me off, “Yeah you do a lot of that. Watch some tv you dumb bitch. Stupid motherf*cker.” At this point I’m overwhelmed and immediately go back in my apartment. I never planned on confronting anyone regardless of who it was, I was just concerned someone was not okay. But he stood in the breezeway for another good 3-5 minutes shouting insults at my door calling me all the things he already had to my face. I do really poorly with confrontation so I was shaking, I called my husband at work, and just decided that I wouldn’t call the police unless something further happened. This all seemed really out of character for what we had experienced before and pretty unstable and unwarranted to yell at a pregnant woman, but he didn’t specifically threaten me or anything so I didn’t want to bother the police with it. Later that night he turned the sound-bar on, turned it up super loud so that I could hear every word of Family Feud as if it was playing through my own tv and later played one of Trump’s speeches at almost the same volume while chanting “Donald Trump!” over and over. 

The whole thing had me really nervous. This was not honestly too long ago, I think early March. I went down to our management office the next day and basically just put them on notice about the whole situation. Everything up to that point. They called him and told him multiple people had complained about his noise level (true, I found out) and he needed to keep it down. He was belligerent, but I noticed a drop again in noise for a couple weeks. I asked if any of this would affect the renewal of his lease and they said not just this, but it if it was an ongoing situation, he had lots of complaints against him, and people felt unsafe it could. This was all from a new property manager, the previous one was terrible and was the reason I had never involved the office before. I avoid him at all costs now, I won’t speak to him and I avoid going outside when I know he’s out there, it’s just not a situation I can deal with since he escalated it.

However, one Saturday in April in the middle of the day he started playing a Trump speech very loud with his door open again for over an hour, and this time my husband was fed up. We could hear it over the show we were watching. So he went over there and said, “Turn it down or close your door”. Neighbor starts yelling at him that he needs to get away from his apartment and my husband just repeats it (he was heated for sure, but never went into neighbors apartment and never said anything else). So neighbor calls him all kinds of names too, tells him we need to move, and makes a move off his couch AT my husband. My husband just turned around and came back to our apartment, he really wanted to get into it with this guy but thankfully has a good head on his shoulders and was thinking about me and baby. So this time he called the police, I wasn’t over there, but he felt like the move wasn’t just getting up to have a conversation or the shut the door, it was threatening in nature. The deputy showed up about 20 minutes later, talked to us, and took a report, but like everything else up to this point nothing has technically happened so 1. He didn’t necessarily want to go talk to him and inflame the situation, and 2. He didn’t really do anything in the eyes of the law. My husband and I just feel like he could be slightly volatile though, with how he escalated from interactions 1 &amp; 2 to 3 &amp; 4 we’re not sure what the future could hold and want what’s happening now documented. As an aside,  he came and knocked on our door like 10 minutes after the deputy left but we didn’t answer because he’s not very predictable. 

The apartment manager told me to keep her updated, so we sent an update with this newest development, but didn’t receive a response, which was okay, we didn’t really need one. But we found out a few days later our apartment complex has been sold and is under new management. So now, part of my predicament is not knowing whether they know about this whole situation at all. I don’t want it to be 0-100 for them when we and the people around us have been having issues for months, but again nothing has really happened tangibly. 

However, tonight again he started yelling “f***ing n*****” repeatedly. Again, we’re both white, but this is really setting me off. On top of just being a generally obnoxiously loud chainsmoking, coughing/hacking, gross old man, with a loud tv and dog, he’s obviously a terrible racist. I have zero tolerance for that in my life, and yet I’m hearing it in my living space. Part of me wants to say it’s his apartment and it’s not my business, but it is 1000% affecting me. I am very close to having my baby now and 1. I can feel my blood pressure rise every time I hear him say that and stress is not good for baby, and 2. My baby might not be able to understand right away, but I honestly just don’t want them hearing it often either (this could be hormones, that and the fact that maybe my ears are sensitive for the same reason, are where I think pregnancy may come in). 

I don’t know if the tv noise will make it hard for baby to sleep during the day either, I am a light sleeper, but my husband is not so it remains to be seen. I am not under any impression that apartment living is 100% silent, I hear the people above us making normal living noises all the time, but this literal constant tv noise that I’m not choosing is driving me insane. 

At this point, I think in my head the best course of action is to go the new management and ask them 1. If they know about/still have record of everything, and 2. If his yelling racial slurs audibly through my wall affects anything legally on their end, like is it more of an offense than a loud tv? All of this is so borderline and seems inane, but I don’t know what to do about it. We can’t move, it’s just not an option right now, I can’t always have noise going to drown him out because of school and soon baby sleeping. I’m honestly concerned he’ll re-sign his lease if I don’t say anything, but I don’t know if I can do anything anyways. I’ll take whatever course of action they say to, but I’m honestly feeling at a breaking point where I want to complain to them every day I hear him yelling slurs and can hear his tv to where I can tell what he’s watching, or I’m going to start calling the police. Again, I don’t care what this guy does on his own time and in his own space, but this is affecting me so. much. 

I know this is so long, but I needed to get this out there even a little bit to rant. Does legal advice apply? Or do I just need a gut check? Am I being petty? Do I need to post this somewhere else? He annoys me, and he’s insanely disrespectful to women, POCs, and people in general, so to a degree I’m going to be petty. But I’m also over putting up with his BS so he can be comfortable and I have to suffer through.

49,Ex Roommate wants me to pay his excel cancellation fees. Despite me not living there.,1588911573,"For starters the ""ex roommate"" in question moved out of the property without warning before I ultimately took his place (As a favor to the other remaining roomies.) I then took over his portion of rent and utilities and paid them to one of the other roommates who still resided on the property. I lived there for 8 months before finally moving out myself. I was not listed on the lease nor the utility bills during this time and had kept up with my payments the whole time I was there. Today the ex roommate notified the current residents (the two other roommates who remained there) that we owed him over $350 for the closing of the account and that the amount was an average of actual usage that had accrued over a full years term + cancellation. Turns out the remaining roomies were using his excel account and had been sending money to him directly for it. The ex roommate closed the account after the other 2 roommates lease ended and they were moving out. He wants each of us to pay over $120 each, but this doesn't make sense to me considering I didn't live there for 4 of those months and that I paid the amount asked of me each month. He's threatening to take me to small claims for it. Does he have an actual case against me?

50,I believe I'm about to be wrongfully terminated from a Law Enforcement Agency as a new Police Officer,1588911565,"I graduated from the Academy and started field training with a local law enforcement agency in January, 2020. 

Long story short, I have witnessed first-hand that officers at this agency are intentionally using excessive force, and then lying about it on the police report. 

In one incident, there was this domestic violence call that came out on the radio. I was dispatched along with several other officers. We arrived on scene and we saw the male suspect leaning against a garage. The officers next to me walked briskly towards him and then told him to turn around. I could already tell this guy had been drinking. The next thing I know, the officers grab him and bring him to the ground on his stomach with his head on the concrete. The male suspect didn't have any time to react or do anything. He was legitimately just standing there. Two officers get on top of him and one officer starts punching him in the face. I get on the ground and grab the male suspect's right arm. After some time, the officer who was punching him says to me, ""Taze him John! Taze him!"" 

At this point I'm thinking, ""What the hell? Taze him for what?"" Anyway, another officer who was on scene uses a drive-stun method and tases the guy on the ground. The guy starts squealing from pain.

Afterwards, one of the officers says ""Did you see him reach for my gun??"" And I'm thinking, ""Um..at no point did that happen.""

Later on, the officers are talking and one of them says to me ""Where were you John?? Why didn't you throw hands?"" (Throw hands is slang for throw punches). And the officer says to me that he gets pleasure out of fighting; he says ""it's better than cumming."" The officer that said the suspect reached for his gun says to me, ""we can write whatever we want in the report"" as he has like, this devious look on his face. At this point I'm thinking, ""so you used excessive force on a guy who wasn't fighting back, and then you lie in the report?""

I read the police report later on. It says directly that the male suspect placed a ""firm grip"" on the officer's gun handle with his right hand and ""pulled it away."" This never happened. How could it? I was holding on to his right arm the whole time. 

On several occasions an officer has said to me, ""next time something happens, you BETTER throw hands John."" My response is always, ""Yes, sir."" 

This is only one instance of several. Fights occur almost every other week at this city I work at. And I know that it's because these officers like to fight. they tell me they like to fight. They instigate fights. I've seen them get mad. I've seen them lose their cool. One time I heard two officers talk about a fight and one officer asked, ""So what happened?"" and the other officer responds, ""Well, he was being an asshole so..""

You might ask me why I haven't said anything to anyone. The reason is, this job is life/death. I have to seriously be aware of all the repercussions of every choice I make. If I ""whistleblow"", what happens if the officer gets mad at me? These are my coworkers, not my friends. And they have guns. I've already seen them get into fights because they got mad. Additionally, I need to maintain good relationships with them for my own safety. If I call for backup, I need them to respond. These are my reasons.

But now, I'm at a point where I'm being told that I have ""officer safety"" issues and they're going to recommend to admin that I don't continue field training, which means I would get fired. And ""officer safety"" is notorious for law enforcement agencies when they want to articulate performance problems with the new trainee if they're trying to get rid of him. That's me. My performance has been as good as I could give. I gave 100% since day 1. They pushed me every minute of every shift, but I stayed with it. And I'm going to get punished because I refuse to bad things? 

I'm not angry. The feeling I have is sadness. A deep, deep sadness.

62,Step son's (4M) mom gave up rights to her eldest child. Can was use this legally in our own court case?,1588910362,"Hello! I'm very new to reddit sorry in advance. For reference I (26F) BF (26M) step son will be SS, his mother (28F) referred to as M and her oldest daughter will be J (9F).

My boyfriend has an adorable 4 year old son. He's been the primary caregiver since he broke up with his ex 3.5 years ago. They never got the courts involved but she's always been fine with BF having him.

Obviously I'm biased, but M's a selfish person. In the 2 years I have been with BF she has constantly changed when and how she is picking up her son, often giving us less then 24 hours notice of the changes and even failing to pick up her kid entirely. We already had plans to get a lawyer involved, I may have put my foot down saying I wanted things ironed out before marriage and BF agreed especially since the mom moved about 3 hours away several months ago so is seeing her son even less then she originally did.

M has 3 children with different men with SS being her youngest and J the oldest. Recently I was contacted by J's other parents on FB. They wanted to make sure that their daughter could still have contact with her brother since about a month ago M gave up her legal rights as her mother. We were shocked as this hadn't even been mentioned to us, we agreed that of course they would be able to see each other but asked for more information since this came out of left field.

I won't go into too specific details since we're talking about a Minor but basically J didn't want to live with her mother since M was forcing her to be a babysitter for both SS and her other child. When J lost our kid SS one day M punished her severely for it. We don't know how long our kid was lost or the type of punishment given and were never told of this incident. Not long after this J's dad got an attorney to fight for a change in custody agreement and at that time M gave up her rights as J's mom.

We had already planned on going forward legally but due to Covid-19 have had to postpone our plans for monetary reasons. Now though we're wondering if we should use this in our case against her, or if this would be good grounds to ask for full custody of SS instead of just officially having primary custody of him, or if this is just further complicating an already pretty straight forward case. We're just worried since not only do we not have a court order for him, but we also are having to rely on testimony from people we don't know well.

I should note we had contacted a lawyer before for a consultation who said that we already had a strong case and that the courts wouldn't make us change our current arrangement but would just make it legally binding/involve child support payments.

I've moved plenty of times and my experience has always been about the same: about a month or two later I receive an itemized list for cleaning and damages and, if the landlord isn't terrible, a little bit of the security deposit back.  This time, I received an itemized list of cleaning and damages that was around $400 higher than the security deposit I had already paid with a note asking that I ""remit the balance immediately.""  They want me to pay them $400 more after I have already moved out.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I already have a semblance of a plan as to what to do about this.  Some of the itemized charges are blatantly against the lease and I believe I can negotiate with them to bring the charges back to the total of the security deposit.  I won't lie, I left some holes in the wall and I never expected to get the whole security deposit back.  It would be nice to get some of the money back, but if the security deposit is my payment to never deal with these people again, I guess that's okay.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my questions: is this even legal?  Can you charge someone more than their security deposit?  I've never heard of this happening and despite my best google I can't find anything.  It feels predatory and ridiculous to me but the last thing I want is this to go to collections and ding my credit score.  Any advice is much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional information that I have no clue if it will be helpful:

&amp;#x200B;

This is not the landlord I originally signed the lease with.  Management changed a few months before I moved out.  I signed over the lease and I can't find anything that suggests anything wasn't done correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked about a walk through a week before the move.  Because of COVID, they declined.  It looks like Colorado doesn't require a walk through and I'm feeling now like I should have insisted.",legaladvice,False,secdepositovercharge,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfllt8/security_deposit_over_charge/

80,question about non-refundable deposit for pets,1588908518,"Hi -

I have a question about non-refundable deposits on puppies from breeders. I've been looking for a puppy for a while now and I found a 5-week old pup yesterday through a breeder who seemed well-reviewed. And finally I put a 50% deposit down (\~$1200) yesterday evening at around 7pm (about 7 hours after I spoke with the breeder). The total invoice included the cost of the puppy, flight charges and paypal transaction fees. Additionally, the invoice mentioned the following under ""Terms and Conditions"":

""*This Invoice shows the total amount due, only the 50% deposit is due at this time to hold the puppy of your choice.*

*The Balance must be paid in full by 5/11/2020 (6 weeks of age), to accomodate booking flight &amp; Health certificate for Air travel. \*Again American Airlines, Direct flights only, can be used at this time*""

I came to find out today that i might have to undergo surgery later this month, while not life-threatening, is likely to have a fairly long recovery (about 3-4 months of restricted movement). And so I checked in with the breeder (**within 24 hours of making the payment**) to see if it would be possible to get a refund (partial at the very least) since it wouldn't be a good time for me to take care of a young puppy when I'm not able to function normally. Based on this conversation, she put the pup back on sale via the website I found the breeder and also mentioned that deposits would not be refunded partially or fully.

I have 2 questions here:

\- Would it be possible for her to force me to pay the remainder of the total invoice (the other 50%)?

\- Do I have any legal grounds to get my deposit back (partially or fully)? \[*considering* *I wasn't told the deposit would be non-refundable when I spoke with her, nor was it on the invoice and nor on any communication between me &amp; her, prior to me paying the deposit*\]",legaladvice,False,ta34251,/r/legaladvice/comments/gflj17/question_about_nonrefundable_deposit_for_pets/

86,"Seeking advice regarding a brand new car with engine problems, possible lemon law claim",1588908163,"I bought a brand new 2018 Ford Escape SE in June 2018 with 350 miles. After 11 months my car started to jerk as I was in reverse. I took it to the dealership (June 2019) that I bought it from to have it looked at. The coolant was low, so they topped it off and told me to keep an eye on it (this was a Thursday).  On Monday my car started to do the same thing, I checked my coolant and it was almost empty, so I called the dealership and they had me bring it back that evening.  They found that my coolant was draining into the engine, and stated that Ford was going to buy me a new engine.  The dealership had the car for 6 weeks. At this time my car only had 24,000 miles. I also found out that it was being rebuilt not a new motor.  I got my car back in the middle of July.  

The middle of August my car started to ride a little rough, so I again called the dealership and told them. I took the car to them and at this time they stated that they needed to do a computer update, I had told them that my engine was moving when I put it into gear and I thought that it may be a broken motor mount. 

In October I was rear ended so my car was in the repair shop for 4 weeks (Mid October-Mid November).  At the beginning of December I called the shop that repaired my car from my wreck and stated that my car was running rough and wondered if there could have been front end damage at the time of my wreck.  They contacted the dealership and took it to them, which they found that it needed a new motor mount (which I originally thought in August).  The dealership ordered the part and would call me when it came in.  

About a week later the part came in, and the day before it started to jerk again when I was reversing.  I checked my coolant and once again it was very low (below min level).  At this time my car now has right under 30000 miles.  I took the car back to the dealership to have the motor mount fixed and informed them the coolant was low. I expressed that I wanted to look into the lemon law because my car was doing the same thing that it had done before. I was informed that Ford would not do a buy back without trying to repair the car again. At this time they did a redesign rebuild engine which took another 5 weeks.  I got my car back in the middle of February 2020.  

A few weeks later I noticed that my cars start/stop had stopped working along with the traction control.  I looked under the hood for some reason and noticed my coolant was low again.  I contacted the dealership at which point we are on a first name basis and took it to them.  At first they were on board with filing a claim through Ford. They checked the car over and stated that I had a coolant leak but they were not sure where it was and that I needed an update for my start/stop. This was not an engine issue so no claim was filed.  

About 4 weeks ago I had to call because my car was making a rattling noise when hitting bumps. So again I took it in and they found that it had a loose wheel arm that needed to be replaced due to being off so many times, that was then replaced.  All was well until 2 days ago and big shocker my car engine is now making a knocking noise.  When looking it up it would appear to be a cracked block.  

A back story, when purchasing the car i was $4000 upside down in the car I traded in.  From my understanding if Ford were to buy back the car they would not refund the purchase price they would deduct the use of the car/mileage/etc. I have paid for this car for almost 2 years and now owe right at $24000, the car blue books for around $16000. (It now has rear end damage on the title) I cannot trade it in or I will be in worse shape than I started. If I do nothing eventually my warranty will run out. I put approximately 25,000 miles per year on my cars in the past.  So at this point I am at 36,000 and my warranty will only be good for about another year.
A person buys a new car to not have the worry, all I have had is issues for 11 months. 

What do I do? Do I contact a lawyer and bypass the dealership? Do I contact Ford directly? Thank you in advance for reading.",legaladvice,False,rando15247_2554,/r/legaladvice/comments/gflg2i/seeking_advice_regarding_a_brand_new_car_with/
87,Aunt and uncle took advantage of my grandfather and potentially stole my inheritance,1588908146,"Hi all, this is a long one, but I’ll simplify it the best i can. 

My uncle (U) is the son of my grandfather (G) who passed away in 2015. U is married to my aunt (A), and they’re kinda really... sketchy. 

U and A have filed for bankruptcy twice to my knowledge, and are really bad at handling finances (for the record). They’ve run more than one “business” that has failed catatonically. 

My grandpa had throat cancer, and was extremely out of it in the months before his passing. After my grandma (GA) passed in 2012, G gave me GA’s wedding band and told me he wanted me to have it because he did not trust U and A to not selling it. This was shortly after U and A’s bankruptcy. At this time G had no mental health issues, aside from his wife’s passing. He gave GA’s other ring to his first daughter for safe keeping for the same reason. U and A also had a small necklace that was willed to me by my great aunt and refused to give that to me for many years. 


In G’s original will I was willed either money or assets amounting to about $200k for college and starting my life. It is unknown if it was monetary or assets. Six months before his passing G and A were made to be his executor for his will, and two weeks before his passing his will was changed to where they were to receive everything and that no grand children would receive anything. 

U and A sold the family house, and moved to a lush home states away nearly immediately after his passing. They also have gone on several vacations and truly are living a plush life. 

It was stated by U and A that G “did not want it to be known of his passing”, which led to majority of the family not knowing of his passing, nor of his will being changed. It was not made known for over a month that he passed, and not until years later that his will was changed so soon to his passing. 

I can confirm these events and information with nearly any and all of my family. 

Was it legal of them to change his will two weeks before his passing? 

Is it worth following through with a lawyer?

What type of lawyer would one talk to about this? 

Advice? 

While that extra money would be extremely helpful I am more upset over the fact that they took advantage of someone who trusted them so greatly in his final moments. I want to go to college, but financially it’s impossible.

Today I was driving my yellow Hyundai in the right hand lane on a main road where I live. A red kia soul was a little infront of me in the left lane. All of a sudden the red kia decided to cut in front of me and turn right to a side road. I inevitably hit him on his right side, he continued driving and stopped a block away. He got out to look the damage. I got out to ask him to come back. He started freaking out and was seriously angry and I felt threatened. About 10 peoples from the surrounding houses, cars, and businesses all came out to my 'rescue' and this guy got back in his kia and drove off. I had the cops come and me and my 2 passengers gave statements, and 2 witnesses idle at the red light of the intersection who saw the whole thing gave statements. The whole event was on multiple cameras, and the police officer pulled up the video and told me that the red kia was at 100% liability. My car had to get towed as it was not able to be driven. After the whole event I get home and about an hour after the impact, I start getting neck pain and one of my passengers is dizzy with a headache. We both go to urgent care, I cat x-rays and cat scans and am told that I have pretty bad whiplash in my neck and back, and that my muscle strain is equivalent to someone days into whiplash, so it'll get bad. The doctor told me not to work for 4 days at least, and if I do go back be very careful (I'm a cashier). My passenger has a mild concussion and is told to rest for a week and avoid mental strain. They are scheduled to start a new job at a children's orphanage home as an intern next week. I call the police to update my report with our injuries, they inform that a woman called about how they were involved in a hit and run. They said that a yellow car hit them dead on and drove off. They also said this occurred on the opposite side of town from where the accident actually happened, AND they are trying to blame me for all of it. She also said she was driving her red kia, with her boyfriend and her mother as passengers. That wasn't even true, the boyfriend was driving the car, and the mother was the only passenger. The police officer told me they knew that they were blatantly lying, and that the hit and runners would be coming into the station and be charged with hit and run from personal injury and submitting a false police claim. He also told me that they are clearly at 100% fault. This whole ordeal took up atleast 7 to 8 hours. This all took place on camera and the red kia is obviously at fault. This is also during the middle of me and my passenger's finals week at school, and we can't think straight. We're scared to drive or even ride in a car, it was both of our first accidents and it was very traumatic. We are both very anxious in general and this is the last thing we needed. 

Phew... that was the story. Hopefully you're still with me. My question is, what are my next steps? Should I sue them? I emailed a personal injury lawyer, but I'd hate to have to spend money on all of their work or time and then find out I have no claim to anything. I don't really know how suing works and I would hate to get in trouble, or reverse sued or something like that. I mostly want justice for the whole ordeal, this guy looked very scaring and threatening and I'm honestly worried of retaliation if I pursue legal action. What do I need in order to sue him? Is it worth it usually? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Hopefully I managed to make it a somewhat interesting read.

I don't know where they are exactly in the process, but the real estate agent's client (the one trying to sell the house) has an attorney that would like to change the terms of the offer.

They haven't been in this position before and would like clarification. Here are the terms:

1. Use a binder form instead of a contract form before the inspection
2. Inspection to be done within 10 calendar days as opposed to 10 business days (why is this important?)
3. 12 calendar days to the formal contract signing
4. 35 calendar days for the mortgage (parents have already been approved)
5. Deposit check to be made out to our attorney's firm for holding
6. Title search date to be moved up to be 10 calendar days (what is this?)
7. List price of $499k (taken care of)

I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I also posted on r/RealEstate. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",legaladvice,False,timbers_be_shivered,/r/legaladvice/comments/gfl747/attorney_terminology_terms_for_buying_a_house/
99,Gun Law Advice - Cabelas and the non-legal transfer.,1588907111,"I  live in Idaho and the other day I ordered 2 stripped lowers from  Cabelas.  I live quite a ways from the store but drove into town there  to pick them up after they arrived at the store. I filled out the paper  work then stood around for about an hour waiting on the background check  which took abnormally long.  Turns out I had misspelled my middle name  in the system before they ran the check which probably was the hold up.  They had me initial and date some corrections on the transfer paper work  when the background check finally passed  I was allowed to leave with  my merchandise so, oops my bad but no harm no foul.

Today  I got a call from another Cabelas employee telling me that because my  middle name was misspelled this was not considered a legal transfer and  I'll have to drive back to the store with the receivers, hand them over,  get another background check then drive back (providing everything goes  well on the check which it should i have nothing weird in my past).  My  issue is, I've already built up one lower up and I'm going to lose half  a day driving just to take these back and forth, for now a 2nd time.   Should I even bother?  What could they do?  These were paid for and they  handed them over and the parts are already on one.  So if by some odd  chance things didn't go well I'm going to either have to complain to get  a parts kit or have them try and take it off and give it too me? (How  long that would take and in what condition it would be in when I get it  back is in question.)
