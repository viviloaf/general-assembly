0,Custody battle help!!!,1589270813,"Basically my male friends mum is in a custody battle with his step-dad over his younger brother. The step-dad has been granted with time to see and speak to the younger brother something like weekly or daily via a call, or sometimes the younger brother will have to see him in person per the step-dads request. When they have these meet ups, there is a supervisor there watching. My friend has reason to believe that the supervisor is being paid out by the step-dad (or at least being dishonest in favour of him) to take a biased stance, as the supervisor is writing down incorrect information about the meet ups, such as the mother and brother and grandma all being abusive and threatening the younger brother (which I know is absolutely untrue, they’re all such kind and lovely people and they treat her so well). So essentially the supervisor is lying about the situation. According to my friend, the court is trusting of this supervisor despite her dishonesty, and apparently she has been caught out before for it, so it’s a bit puzzling as to how she is allowed to continue with her career. But anyway, it seems as though the court is leaning towards the step-dad, who has had history with drug and alcohol abuse, and has even openly admitted to not wanted the younger brother. The step-dad and supervisor both have no physical evidence of the threat that this family pose to the younger brother, a part from heresay (idk if i used that right). Is there any way to request a new supervisor, or possibly a new judge? Or just anything they can do to prove that they are fit to raise the child? They believe that the step-dad is doing all of this just to cause them strife.  Could they request someone investigate the supervisor or the step-dad? Could they get the upper hand in the case if they provide the court with some evidence of the step-fathers inability to have custody the younger brother? If so, how could they get the evidence? 
Sorry if this isn’t worded right or doesn’t legally/grammatically make sense. Any advice is appreciated!",legaladvice,False,georgie0011,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi6xlb/custody_battle_help/
1,"Speeding Ticket changed to (Possible Unlawful &amp; Innacurate) DUI [SF, CA]",1589270809,"Hello, 

I was in the car with two friends tonight, and the driver (one of the friends)  was going about 10-15 miles above the speed limit (45-50 in a 35 zone). We were pulled over and the driver was asked if she had anything to drink. The driver did not drink, but my friend and I did. The police officers asked the driver to step out of the car, walk the line, and hold her foot. She complied and did all of those, and she complied with the breathalyzer test. The officers had her do it nine times, and each time the result was zero (as she did not drink). Her parents were called, but were not allowed to go to her, as the police officers told her parents that if the parents crossed the road and went to her, they could be arrested for interfering. She had to stand outside in the cold and was not allowed to put the jacket on. After the fourth time she had to do the test, she told the police officers that just because she was a kid didn't mean they could mistreat her. One of the police officers called her a little shit and told her to stop messing around with them. After about an hour of this, the cops called her parents over and told her parents to sign a document (in the document, they checked that she refused the test, even though she took the test nine times). I am wondering if they broke any laws with this/ messed up on procedure (they did not mention anything about her license being suspended for a year when they checked the breathalyzer refusal box). There were four cops and one of the cops was a trainee. They never gave her a speeding ticket, but they did give her parents the information with the DUI checkmark. We're all reeling a bit and confused as to why that happened to her. If you could provide any advice, that would be much appreciated, as again she was not drinking and would never drive under the influence.",legaladvice,False,Kuzco99,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi6xkh/speeding_ticket_changed_to_possible_unlawful/

Second, we rented a condo in Washington County - Tigard/Beaverton (still not entirely sure since we are on the border and even the police department has some issues determining who's in whose jurisdiction).

Our (my BF and I) lease began 08/14/2018 and ended 08/31/2019. We decided to continue our tenancy and agreed to rent for another six months - which was a new lease agreement beginning: 09/01/2019-03/31/2020. 

Upon first moving in, we paid: $2,572.58 (ended up paying with a personal check and not Cashier's as had been requested originally)

* $400.00 - Non-refundable pet rent.
* $1,200.00 - Security Deposit
* $972.58 - Pro-rated rent 8/14/18-8/31/18 *(this is including both the start and end date of the proration)*

*I reversed our monthly rental amount of $1,675.00 ($1,650 rent + $25 pet rent), divided that by 31 days, and multiplied the days for the prorated rent (x18) and returned the figure of $972.58.*

**August 13, 2018 - Email Received 9:39AM:**

""The pet deposit and security deposit and pro rated rent ($1650.00 + $25.00 monthly pet = $1675.00 per month) will be accepted as a cashiers check initially and we'll provide you with the bank instructions for ACH receipts of all future rent payments."" 

 **August 13, 2018 - Email Received 11:49AM:**

""9:30 am works for us.  I've just sent the lease.  It will go to *\[removed BF's name\]* first then you.  One clarification is that we charge the $400 non-refundable pet deposit and an additional $25.00 per month for the pet, but our lease program doesn't pick that up properly. 

Congrats and we'll see you tomorrow morning.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Third, I will list both our responsibilities and also our grievances with the landlord's responsibilities:

**Negatives on our side we take responsibility for:**

* I did get a cat outside of our lease agreement and we did speak with the landlord about it. It wasn't a big deal and her next course of action was to raise our rent $25.00/month for the additional pet with the new lease agreement (09/01/2019-03/31/2020). 
* Upon raising this monster of a cat - also found out that she likes bamboo - which led to her eating my bamboo plant and got diarrhea. I did my best to clean it up, however, I did anticipate a cleaning expense for this.
* The cat did damage some of the carpet leading into the Master Bedroom (she shredded the bit of carpet under the door). Again, I did anticipate an expense for the damage).
* Drywall repair/a couple of holes patched - I did anticipate an expense for this.
* Communication: The dog is a companion pet (my BF is a Veteran and has PTSD and was granted the ability for a companion pet. We do have a copy of the letter from the VA stating this. However, I do not believe we communicated this to the landlords - *why I thought this might be relevant is that I had read online that companion pets can not be charged a deposit, however, we were charged - but did not communicate the fact that the dog was a companion pet.* 
* Communication Cont..:The house was also not weatherized properly, did not properly heat the entire house, and any heat it did provide did not stay for any period of time. The only proof I have of this is the $250.00 electric bill during the wintertime - again, we did not communicate this to the landlord until February 11, 2020. In terms of excuses, the only one I have is not wanting to come off as ungrateful for letting us rent when we were in a situation where we couldn't get approved anywhere else but were needed to move as soon as possible.
*  I am a proponent of trying to settle things amicably, and love to argue the facts if warranted in a given situation, however, I am coming to accept that I cannot control anyone. My BF ***dead-ass*** removed all of the light bulbs in the house. They had communicated (by text) that they were going to start construction as soon as we vacated, but asked us to mop the floors (they were already swept and cleaned). This was absolutely a petty move with a splash of resentment on my BF's part (that I did not encourage) and he stated to me ""Well these are my light bulbs, I paid for them. They can go buy their own light bulbs."" 

**Landlord Factors: (Husband and wife + 1 rando with a different last name on the title)**

* They completely renovated the home upon our departure - replaced the tile, carpet, floors, doors, windows, etc. I am not 100% sure of everything they did in terms of renovation however, I do have the ability to find out (if needed). 
* The carpet prior to us moving in had been stretched and was **not** new. Pictures taken with the cat damage can prove this.
* The house contained 2 ductless Mitsubishi heating systems (one in the living room and one in the master bedroom).
* There was a massive hole underneath our kitchen sink in which, they told us to staple black tarp against to stop the cold air from flowing in. We were never able to align in schedules and this repair was never made. 
* Painting windows shut does not weatherproof windows. **L.O.L.** They replaced the 2 bedroom windows when we first moved in, however, the windows in the living room were painted shut and un-openable and only one of the windows in the kitchen opened as the other, like the living room, was painted shut. 
* In addition to not having an exhaust fan or micro-hood and only one window in the kitchen that actually opened, led to a lot more fire alarms going off and a lot more annoyances, furthermore, leading to the removal of the smoke alarms that went off on an almost daily basis as I cook - ***on a daily basis***.

**March 1, 2020 - Email received:**  

All three of us owners have made a discussion and we will not be renewing your lease when it expires on 3/31/2020. We have decided to do some work to the unit and it must be vacant to do so. Please arrange to be out on this date and schedule a move-out walk through for sometime on Wednesday April 1. Thank you in advance for your understanding.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In sum, I feel taken advantage of. Whether those feelings are right or not, it feels unfair. The rental market even in 2018, did not warrant the high amount that we were paying in rent monthly. The only justification that I have been able to make was we were paying a higher amount because we were a higher risk tenant - understandable. However, with the massively high electric bills, paying every single month of rent, and being a low-maintenance tenant - had higher expectations, which I accept as my own fault for setting the wrong expectations.

Given the situation with COVID, have had a massive amount of stress and emotional turmoil (laid off from job, home sellers not selling houses and isolating (which is what we both do for work)), in addition to not having any help moving*.* Although we were only moving next door, you don't realize how much shit you have until you're taking boxes one by one next door - which led to the delay in vacating. *- Yes, we moved next door and yes our new landlord (who is amazing) called our old landlord that we had listed as a reference for her to call. (I found this highly entertaining as I tried to envision how our new landlord navigated a conversation regarding her new tenants).* Anyways, I sent a text to our old landlord on April 5 at 8:14 PM saying ""Hi \[landlord\], we need one more day. We are physically exhausted and emotionally drained from maintaining safe health measures due to COVID and moving"".

Lastly, given that this post is long enough I won't get too far into it, basically my BF got upset with the response that she sent, said he wasn't going to pay the daily rent she was charging us. *I figured she would take it out of the Security Deposit anyways so it wasn't a battle I was willing to fight -* ***at that time. Well,*** BF's comment did not blow over well which led to them pounding on our new rental unit's door at 11 AM like the FBI (3x in a row progressively getting louder each time), some choice words and angry verbiage being exclaimed - BF asked him to leave multiple times and told him to get off the property, the husband (old landlord) got in my BF's face (not maintaining social distancing), BF got triggered (PTSD from Military), BF picked husband (landlord) up by his shirt collars and placed him (not so gently) on the sidewalk and out of front entryway - he did not hit him. Wife (landlord) called the police and husband (landlord) spent the duration (waiting for the cops) antagonizing my BF and making condescending comments to instigate my BF to hit him. Shortly after the cops showed up and  everything was explained to the police - the police left and that was that. Given the fact that we are neighbors, you can probably imagine the highly awkward vibe going around. HOWEVER, the neighbors were super supportive of my BF given the fact that the husband (landlord) was not being safe when he closed the 6ft distance and heard the commotion going on (neighbor even stated hearing the husband (landlord) pounding on our door).

In summation, what are your thoughts regarding withholding our deposit? In an effort to provide all of the details, I am truly interested on what the right this to do is moving forward and if we are in a situation to get a partial amount of our deposit back.

5,My mother(45f) allowed her boyfriends to rape me(26f)and my sister(18f) when we were minors and is now grooming our youngest sister(15f) for my moms new boyfriend. Do we have an at least moderate chance to get a conviction if we testify together despite no physical evidence? HI,1589269387,"So basically my mom used to sell mine and my sisters(while we were minors) used panties online and gave explicit “permission” to her boyfriend to rape me and my sister. We each were assaulted by 2 separate men at different times. I was 17 and my sister was 14. 

We have no proof. She refused to drive us to get a rape kit(because we were both underaged and not driving when it occurred)and denies any culpability however both men have separately texted my sister and I to inform us that “it was okay because your mom told me I could”. Unfortunately i never saved the text however my sister has a screenshot. 

I’m not sure the statute of limitations on all of this or if it’s even technically a crime. My sister and I have both been looking to prosecute due to our youngest sister(15) living with my mom and being groomed by my mom and her new boyfriend. We tried to call CPS but my mom manipulated the situation and got the investigation called off(it was her 10th CPS investigation). 

I’ve heard horror stories about women taking it to court and being discredited due to sexual history and I’m not willing to put myself or my sister through anything like that. I feel so much guilt because I thought it would only happen to me and it ended up happening to my other sister. I fucked up once but i want to do anything I can to protect my youngest sister from being out through such a traumatic experience.

10,Water damage caused by Best Buy’s subcontractor: all companies involved are refusing any responsibility despite undeniable proof provided by subcontractor itself - NEED ADVICE (Texas),1589268095,"TLDR; Bough refrigerator and new water line September 2019 from Best Buy. Delivery company fucked it up and installed old water line. Water leaked and caused damages. Best Buy/their insurance company and every company involved is refusing to pay for repair cost unless we file suit. 

Here is the story with more details:
My husband and I bought a refrigerator from Best Buy at the beginning of September 2019 along with a stainless steal water line, which we were advised to by the sales representative (“in case anything goes wrong” -he said). Paid for delivery and install. 
When the company arrived, we all noticed the water line was too short, so my husband asked the delivery men not to worry about installing the water and we’d take care of it. Fast forward to mid October 2019, we noticed a leak under the fridge. Naturally, we investigated and noticed the old water line, which was decrepit, was installed! We were upset to say the least. 
We noticed water damage and molding so we immediately begin a claim and began mitigation. After following up on my claim, I was first put in contact with the delivery company’s (subcontractors) insurance company; where we were informed did not have coverage at the time of delivery. So we were escalated to their contractor (the company contracted out by Best Buy), who denied our claim twice despite evidence of them breaking protocol with installing an old water line. 
After much persistence I was finally able to reach a very helpful claims representative for liabilities with Best Buy’s insurance company. The representative has been the most helpful in this ordeal and was finally able to get us a check for the mitigation cost but now we’re trying to fight for the cost of the repairs. 
The company who handles the mitigation also quoted us for repair work which we sent to the representative to make our case. She also sent out an adjuster in Mid January 2020. I’m assuming to compare the estimates of the cost of repairs. 
I thought we were making progress but its now mid May 2020 and we’ve been told by the claims representative that she has been informed that unless we file suit, they will not resolve this claim. 

I have so many feelings about all this but I’m trying to keep those to myself since I know it won’t help.

He ran a website that supported Isis, and encouraged people on how to make bombs and was arrested again. My friend was so hurt to call him a friend and regretted the times he spent defending him. Tbh, I never suspected him of terrorism he kept his extremist views out of the chat room.

* I applied online, uploaded a CV that had information about where I received my bachelor's degree. One could clearly infer which country I am a citizen of based on my undergraduate institution.
* Had 2 interviews, the interviewers were very impressed. One week later I received the offer: an email saying I was being offered the position + PDF document describing the details.
* A few days after receiving the offer I got an email from my recruiter saying ""there is an urgent update regarding the status of my internship"" and that he needs to talk to me on the phone. I got slightly worried but assumed they are going to talk about going virtual etc...
* During the phone meeting with the recruiter, I was told they are going to rescind the offer due to complications associated with my nationality. They apologized and told me these issues are because of certain sanctions from the Department of Treasury and the company can't do anything about it.

The trust (or will?) contained instructions to disburse $X monthly from the trust to the beneficiary until all funds are distributed. The beneficiary is asking for a large distribution - roughly 10x the monthly distribution - to ""take care of some bills"". My colleague would like to oblige but is worried about breaking the rules of the trust.

The beneficiary's financial situation is very...*unstable*...and it's anticipated that they continue to request large sums of money like this in the future. To avoid the stressful situation of dealing with repeated requests for money, my colleague would prefer to dissolve the trust and distribute all funds to the beneficiary at once. This was not the intent of the deceased, but it will reduce tension between the trustee and beneficiary.

Is there a legal way to do this? If so, where would my colleague begin? Is it something that can be handled remotely and without paying an attorney?",legaladvice,False,n0cluewhatimdoin,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi61se/mt_is_it_possible_to_dissolve_a_trust_at_the/

21,[CA] Estate Planning question regarding deceased Great Aunt's Will,1589265505,"This is going to get a little long and I am going to try to leave out the 'family drama' that is unfolding as much as I can (that's probably a lie this has a lot of drama to it as well as legal issues). 

On my mother's side is quite a large family, she is one of seven (7) children. There were four (4) boys and three (3) girls; two (2) of the boys are now deceased, my mother is the middle of three (3) girls. 

My eldest Aunt, my mother's oldest sister, volunteered to provide senior care to my Grandma and Great Aunt about five (5) years ago. We wil refer to her as Aunt Jane. Aunt Jane often would complain about the burden and stress of the amount of senior care she had taken on. Various family members would volunteer to 'take a turn' to help out, however on almost every occassion Aunt Jane would not take a break, she continued her regular acitivites making the alternate family member's presence practially null and void. This included my mother coming out from several states over in November of last year to give Aunt Jane a ""mental health break"". Unfortunatley it was during this time my Great Aunt passed away at the age of 98. 

My Aunt Jane, almost immediately after my Great Aunt's death declared the house (that my Grandma and Great Aunt lived in) was ""her's"". No official document other than a title in joint ownership has been provided. It is completely unclear as to whether Aunt Jane's name was added because my Great Aunt was giving her the house post-death or rather just adding her to title to ease some on the issues that may arise upon her death. 

Two (2) days after my Great Aunt passed my Aunt Jane got upset with my mother (this wasn't completely uncommon, they have had a love/hate relationship since, well if we're being honest since they were born), however, in this particular ""hate session"" my Aunt Jane told my mother to ""get the fuck out of her house"", she did this in front of my 98 year old Grandmother who does not handle conflict of any kind well. My mother was thousands of miles from her home without transporation. I had to impromtuly take the day off of work to drive two hours to get her (I live in CA) and bring her back to my home with no notice (my boyfriend was thrilled). 

My Aunt Jane was claiming since she was on the deed the house was now hers. In probably January, my youngest aunt, lets call her Aunt Sally, who is the Executor of my Great Aunt's Estate emailed my Great Aunt's Will to the family (just to her siblings, I was provided a copy from my Mother). The Will is apporximately fifteen (15) years old. 

The Will was not changed to provide my eldest Aunt the house in any explicit terms. To date no document other than the Deed with Aunt Jane's name on it indicates it was my Great Aunts intention for the house to be Aunt Jane's. What the Will does explictly state is that should she proceed her sister (my Grandma) in death the house is to be left for her to live in for as long as she wants or until she passes. There was also designation of certain bank accounts that my Great Aunt had that were to be used for the costs of the house (property taxes, utilities, upkeep, repairs etc.). 

Since that time my Aunt Jane has begun repairs and remodeling of the house. She is now insisting that my Grandma move out of the house. Initially it was a move out so repairs could be made. Now it appears that Aunt Jane is making these repairs to sell the house and is, based on my conversations with my Grandma, in discussions with a Realtor to list the house for sale. 

My Aunt Jane and Aunt Sally are both pushing my Grandma to move into assisted care in the Bay Area when that isn't what she wants but she is feeling bullied. My eldest Uncle and my Grandma's eldest son, who is an attorney, is doing nothing other than 'making arrangments for the move.' 

Based on the Will I think what my two Aunts are doing is wrong. My grandma doesn't want to move, yet they are ignoring her completely. I called my Grandma on Mother's Day and she told me ""the girls"" -- Aunt Jane and Sally -- were going through pictures and boxes of what to keep and toss. Grandma didn't explicitly tell me she didn't want to leave the house but I could hear she was sad. My mother who talks to my Grandma (her Mom) daily, says that Grandma as said she doesn't want to move. 

My other living Uncle shared a voicemail from my Grandma that she left him saying that the Aunts were bullying her into leaving and she didn't want to and needed help. 

So I know that's a lot of rambling; let's do takeaways or TL:DR; 

1. Other than the Deed being in Joint name of my Aunt Jane and Great Aunt does this qualify as a transfer of property to Aunt Jane solely?; 
2. With the Will of my Great Aunt stating that the house should remain for my Grandma for as long as she want to/lives preclude any sale of the house my Aunt is attempting? 
3. What is the likelihood of a granted order to an Ex Parte/TRO to stop the sale of the house and allow my Grandma's continued residence in the property? 
4. My Aunt Jane was only added to the property Deed three (3) months prior to the death of my Great Aunt; I think there is potential elder abuse, undue influence, on behalf of my Aunt Jane procuring name to title of the property -- what is needed to prove this? 
5. My Aunt Jane up and left my 98 year old grandma without any alternative care plan in place for a two week vacation in the middle of COVID-19 SIP orders. Resulting in a scrambling of family members trying to figure out care which resulted in my Grandma being transported from the Valley to the Bay Area and back in the space of four (4) days. I didn't participate because I was worried in exposing my Grandma to something (I'm healthy but could be asymptomatic) she is also less than a year post-cancer but the rest of the family is not taking this pandemic seriously, it seems.

Episode 1: 2.5 years ago, during a severe storm with winds, top of a tree in our property broke off and landed on a neighbor's backyard. We had previously done trimming of the tree just months ago and the arborist said it was in good shape and we need to check back in 3 years. We gave our insurance details and our insurance company offered to cleanup the branch, given that we had recently done the inspection and we could not have foreseen this. Neighbors rejected the offer, wanted the tree cut, AND all the other 7 trees cut in our backyard. They threaten lawsuit and them churning through 6 lawyers and months of back and forth later, they go silent - no lawsuit filed. Our insurance company provided lawyer representation for us. We did more arborist inspections and they said the trees do not need to be removed. Oh and the fallen branch is still there.

Episode 2: Last year, while walking in the yard I noticed strong diesel smell and upon closer inspection it was apparent that someone had poured diesel on the roots of the concerned tree and more trees, with salt in a trench around the tree (I learnt from internet this is a thing to kill trees - why would they do this to kill beautiful trees :( ). We reported to the police. We have a lawsuit on them as a result. They made it incredibly hard to serve them. Finally they accepted it and immediately filed the lawsuit on us for episode 1. 

They do not have a lawyer for Episode 1. They are representing themselves.

Meanwhile, they are not responsive on ANY communication and it is incredibly hard to work with them. So, we went for summary judgement for the lawsuit they brought on us- but they used tactics and got it postponed twice for another 3 months. (Judge noticed that he was not happy about them dragging it). Both my lawyers are excellent, they are very good at explaining things to me.

I am very worried about the neighbor. Could you please help me with the following:

a) What is the neighbor's incentive to keep postponing and being not responsive? 

b) Am I missing something else that I should do in my best interest? 

c) if the court says we have to remove 7-8 trees, who would have to bear the cost? We love the trees and we hate to lose them. This is so unfair that they/someone poisoned the trees and we have to lose the trees and pay for it to get removed. (I know life can be unfair, but still)

About a month or so later, I had sent a text to who I thought was Eric (20) asking if “he wanted to blaze” meaning smoke weed, stupid I know....

Welp, turns out I had accidentally sent that to the minor co worker and I had mentioned to him the next day at work that it was by accident. But at this point, he had already know I smoked and coincidentally asked me if I could purchase him Vape accessories, I politely declined and that was the end of that.... never thought anything of it. 

Welp fast forward a year later, *today* Jon’s dad Aaron had randomly asked me, “hey I have a question, have you ever sold me son weed?”

I of course denied it as I never have, and he mentioned the text. He wasn’t mad at the time of asking me but admitted he was furious *as any dad would be* when he had first read the texts, and even mentioned he contemplated contacting the police as he had “all the evidence” but decided to ask me man to man before assuming anything, which I genuinely respected. I did admit to the father that his son has asked me to purchase a vape accessory for him but I politely declined as I knew he was a minor and most importantly it was illegal. 

But the text I had sent doesn’t make me seem
As if I’m telling the truth and to be honest, I’m very paranoid now... despite not having done anything. 

Any advice on how I could feel better about this whole situation or more so is that accidental text enough to be worries about? Please help",legaladvice,False,lrritated-,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi4w4m/accidentally_sent_a_text_to_my_minor_coworker/
47,Roommate Locks emotional support cat in her room.,1589261442,"Hello, 

I was told that this Reddit page could help me with some legal advice with this situation (This in Colorado by the way).

So my emotional support cat likes to wander around my 4 bedrooms apartment. Today he walked into a roommate's room before she left on an out of state flight while I was not home. When I got home, I heard my cat behind her locked door (he was there for at most 7 hours). I contacted her if she'd let my friend who picks lock as a hobby unlock her door since the apartment complex provides no lockout service (I know now it wasn't the smartest thing to say). Instead, she called the non-emergency line, and went on a 2-hour text tirade about how I was threatening breaking and entering (also some personal stuff for some reason). So I was forced to pay $190 for a locksmith to unlock her door to retrieve my cat. She also waited until after I notified her that I finally paid for a locksmith, that she would be home the next day to unlock the door. 

I called the non-emergency line myself and they said I would need to contact a lawyer, but my friend told me posting here could help too. Since she was the one who locked my cat in her room, is there any way I could stick some of the cost of the bill on her? Can you really lock roommate's pet's in your room to force them to pay a locksmith? Could have my friend legally unlocked her door to save my cat?",legaladvice,False,TapeMyKnees,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi4w2h/roommate_locks_emotional_support_cat_in_her_room/
48,Question about being laid off in TN.,1589261297,"Sorry if this isn't the best place for this, I wasn't totally sure where to submit it, and haven't been able to actually get a human at all through my unemployment sit for two months now. I live in TN and got laid off in March, due to Covid 19. I still haven't received my unemployment benefits, though I saw today they're finally being approved and worked through. The business that I worked for is a nonprofit retail establishment, and laid me off indefinitely, with no return date listed. 


One of my previous coworkers said they're starting to call people to discuss with them the option to come back to work, though I don't know of a particular date yet, and I'm not sure if they've even tried to contact me or not yet as I get little to no signal at my home and don't have any voicemail from them. 


Due to schools in my area being closed and my husband still working full time, I'm currently the primary caregiver for my 3 year old who was previously enrolled in a pre-K program three days a week. My only relative that previously was able to watch him is self quarantining due to being high risk, and daycare would both be not feasible due to the cost and the fact that my son has therapy multiple times per week (recently through Telehealth, though I think they're working on opening soon).

My question is, would it still be possible to receive my unemployment or the stimulus payments taking my situation into account (assuming my previous employer does in fact end up calling me)? I read the information on the CARES Act, and it looks like it covers primary caregivers, but I'm not totally sure how that would apply or how you utilize that. Is this something I should discuss with my previous employer if they contact me and let them know, or is it something I should attempt to discuss with the Unemployment people (there's no questions I've seen on the questionnaire, though I haven't explored the options if you choose that you've had to refuse work)? If my previous employers call me to discuss work options, and I can't come back due to this, is it something they'll just submit to unemployment through the refusal to work documents?",legaladvice,False,whatathymeitwas,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi4uve/question_about_being_laid_off_in_tn/

57,Landlord misquoted deposit and over charged for late fees,1589260169,"Backstory: I resided at this property for exactly 3 years and one month. The move out date was agreed-upon and everything is in writing via email. I kept most recipes and attached a photo of the charges. 

The issue: Landlord overcharged me for fees but understated my security deposit. (See photos for landlords charges). 

1) After moving out they sent me an itemized security deposit on time. The deposit they listed only includes my security deposit of $1100 but not my $500 pet deposit (which I have a cashiers check for).

2) Charging me $425 for damages. They are considering “damages quoteto be one average size bedroom wall and three doors that I painted one side of while living there and then repainted before I left.

3) Well living there they often tried to overcharged me in fees for late rent. According to lease rent is due by the 3rd. $50 for first late day &amp; $25 for each day after. 

-02/2018 I can’t find that receipt. 
-06/2018 2 days late, I owe $75 not $125
-09/2018 4 days late, I paid $150, which was $25 extra
-06/2019 7 days late, I paid $250, which was $50 extra

4) Landlord states I “abandoned "" the yard. This doesn't fit the legal definition. We have an HOA, but I had a small patio on the 1st floor apartment. I just think they're trying to gauge me. 

Action: I want to go to small claims, but have no clue about the process. I moved out July 31st, 2019. Is there a statute of limitations? Can I still take this to court? Any other advice is welcome.

Please let me know if this doesn't belong here or if anyone can recommend a subreddit that it would be better in. I am just looking to see if I can get my $400 deposit back and want to know if I have any leverage legally.

I used a broker moving company based in Florida and a small LA-based moving company accepted my contract. 

I negotiated my moving contract with the broker from Seattle to Detroit to $1470 moving approximately 286 cubic feet and 75 foot carry distance and I would be provided with 3 movers. I paid $400 upfront via direct deposit as a deposit to the broker. The Florida based company had an average 4.2 rating with over 500 reviews so I felt comfortable doing so to save on the extra 5% that paying with a credit card would charge me.

On May 6, only two movers arrived at 1:15 PM to my Seattle apartment and as they were backing into the loading zone in the back driveway of my apartment, they hit a parked car. The owner of the parked car happened to be outside on a smoke break and witnessed the accident. I believed it was the responsibility of the movers to address their accident, so I personally did not gather photo or video evidence. If needed, I am confident I could retrieve surveillance footage from either the hospital next door to my apartment or the three surrounding apartment buildings. The movers and car owner appeared to verbally resolve the issue by approximately 2:00 PM and at that time, my mover paid $300 in cash to the owner of the car to settle the damage.

I guided the mover into my apartment and showed him my belongings that needed to be moved. He immediately stated that I had more than the agreed-upon amount of belongings. He stated that I had 200 cubic feet more than my estimated quote and I would have to pay an additional $700. I was suspicious that he was attempting to make me cover the $300 settlement with the owner of the parked car I had just witnessed, so I objected to this sudden fee increase. Additionally, I immediately used a tape measure to measure and calculate the volume of all my belongings in front of him, showing that I did not even have 200 cubic feet of belongings total and actually had less than the agreed-upon 286 cubic feet of belongings to be moved. Then, he pointed at my bed frame and stated that it was not included on my listed items on my contract. I immediately showed him my contract which specifically stated “BED, QUEEN (WITH MATTRESS).” This is an item I specifically went over with the broker and the broker stated that my contract would cover both my mattress and frame. He continued to argue with me that my bed frame exceeded the 286 cubic feet and I would need to pay $700. I did not want to continue arguing with him, so I stated that we could leave the mattress and the frame and not include it with my moved goods. He immediately seemed shocked that I decided to leave my mattress and frame. He then looked at my belongings again and stated that I still had “too much stuff,” approximately “100 cubic feet over your quote.”  

He also claimed that the distance from my apartment to the truck was greater than the agreed-upon distance. I spoke with the broker, and the broker clarified with me that the reason there is a “carry distance” is because often when the moving companies are moving in potentially crowded, downtown areas of large cities, they often have to park farther away since there is no parking available for a truck directly at the apartment. In my case, there is a large driveway (approximately 40 feet long by 25 feet wide) off of the street behind my apartment building that my apartment complex’s back gate opens directly into. The moving truck was backed into this driveway and was directly next to the back gate of my apartment complex. It is not an exaggeration when I say that the moving truck was parked less than 5 feet from the back entrance. My apartment is located three floors below the back gate, but additionally, my apartment is across the hall from the elevator. As a result, the broker said that moving my boxes and bed up to the driveway level would not be an issue. However, the mover stated this would be an additional cost of $700 but he said that he would “be nice to me and only charge $350.” He stated a “normal moving company” would charge me $700 for the “long-carry.”

I called the broker in Florida for assistance, but since it was after 2:00 PM PST, there was no one in the Florida office to assist me. At this point, I gave in. My lease ended the next day and I had a hard move out date and had a flight the next morning as well. I told him I would agree to pay him the extra fee, but that I wanted this agreement in writing so that I could understand what I was paying for. He immediately objected and refused to write our agreement down and kept trying to convince me that we only needed a verbal agreement. I told him I had the $700 cash on hand and I could go get $350 more, but he needed to write all of the extra charges down before I would pay for it. Still, he refused to write it down and after more attempts to convince me, he simply stated that they did not want to do the job anymore and left my apartment. I went back to them as they were walking away and stated that I would pay for the extra fees and additionally, throw away any extra volume they claimed I had. 

Still, they got in their truck and started up the engine and stated they did not want to do the job anymore. Their reason was that they had been in the moving industry for a long time and could tell when someone would complain and give them a bad review. They stated since they are a small moving company, one bad review could cost them several other moves. Apparently they did not care about Yelp and Google reviews but were only concerned about the review that I would give the broker as they believed they would lose out on other potential jobs that the broker would give them. Still, although I believed what they were demanding was completely outside the scope of my contract, given my need to move immediately, I told them that I would pay what they asked and would throw away anything that they thought would exceed my allotted space. After discussing until approximately 3:00 PM, the movers stated that they had another job to do in a city that was 20 minutes away and they needed to leave immediately to buy more moving materials so they could arrive onsite by 4:00 PM. They told me that this was a very large move, but they would return to my apartment after this move was completed. 

At approximately 5:20 PM PST, I texted and called the movers to confirm sure they were coming back to my apartment. I received no response. I called the LA main office and got ahold of one of their dispatchers to confirm the movers were coming back. The dispatcher told me that the movers said I canceled my move and that they were not coming back. I believe they claimed I canceled my move so they could prevent me from complaining to the broker about their attempts to charge me extra fees and give them a bad review. I immediately told the dispatcher that I did not cancel and that they stated they were coming back. 

I called my father to share the fact that my movers had attempted to charge me extra fees, then canceled on me. At this point, the broker office in Florida was already closed and we had no way to get in contact with the office. With no options remaining, my father immediately booked a flight and flew to Seattle on Thursday and rented a car. We spent the entire day repacking everything into a rental car. Their office also closed early Friday so we were unable to reach them.

I then called the broker the next business day, Monday, May 11. The customer service representatives were still incredibly difficult to reach due to COVID-19 and when I was finally able to get in contact, she was completely unsympathetic to my situation, saying that I should have called them the day of my move or the next day. I explained to her that the offices were closed the day of my move and the day after, I had tried to get in touch with the office. I then asked to speak to a manager to see if I could get a refund on my $400 deposit, but she immediately stated there was no manager in the office that I could speak with and hung up on me. I tried repeatedly calling the broker office back but was not able to get in touch with any customer service representatives.

70,AirBnB Owner Changes Policy Mid-Stay Dog Bites Staff,1589258369,"We booked an AirBnB for a trip to Montana with our two dogs.
We specifically booked a residence that was dog friendly and not shared.
Dogs were to be crated when we were not present in the rental. We have two metal crates we travel with.
The owner knew about the dogs, as we messaged him beforehand.

Checkout time was at 11am. We have multiple confirmation and reminder emails stating this.

At around 10am on our checkout day we were packing up our truck and finishing our check out procedure. Dogs were out of their crates and watching us pack up inside.
Outside of the rental there was our bright red truck loaded with camping gear parked in the driveway in front of the rental; you had to walk by it to get to the front door.
Leading up to the front door there was camping gear, a cooler, various duffle bags and luggage, some sitting on the patio directly next to the front door. It was very clear that the rental was not vacated.

We heard a commotion downstairs. A lady we were not expecting had entered the rental, the dogs had began barking. The lady said she been bit by one of our dogs.

Outside she was visibly shaken. She had light colored pants on but we saw no signs of
injury, blood, etc. She said repeatedly that she is ""usually good with dogs"", leading
us to believe she entered quickly and attempted to restrain or scold a strange dog in
the rental that was obviously occupied.
 
For the next 15-20 minutes we repeatedly asked to see if there was an injury.
She refused to let us see. She did not inspect the area where she claimed to be bitten while she was at the rental or in our presence. She called her employer during this time.

For the next 15-20 minutes I spoke to her employer using her mobile phone. Her
employer insisted that I provide my information for workers comp. I eventually complied, stating my hesitation of not wanting to be sued in the future. Her employer assured me this would not happen &gt;!(it would)!&lt;, and my information was to be used by her employer purely for worker's compensation claim paperwork.

The cleaner left the premises. We attempted to contact the AirBnB host. They called me back and for the next 10-15 minutes reassured me that we didn't have to worry about anything, that he had used this cleaning company ""for years"" and he would take
care of it. He stated that they ""should not have come when they did"" and was upset
that they entered without knocking. It was evident in this conversation that he
knew the check out time was incorrect and he was frustrated that the cleaner had
entered anyway, seeing that it was obviously not vacated.

After hanging up with the owner I proceeded to take a screenshot of my AirBnB reservation on the app. Pulling up the app I watched the checkout time update from 11am to 10am as the app loaded. We believe one of two things happened:

- The owner adjusted the checkin/out policy as a result of the incident.
- The owner adjusted the checkin/out policy for their account during our stay (
  having rescheduled the cleaner, maybe) without letting us know.

I understand that [changes in dates for a confirmed reservation] (https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/50/as-a-host-how-do-i-make-a-change-to-a-confirmed-reservation)
are possible, and those trigger a change request for the guest. I am not sure
that a change in policy triggers a change request in a similar manner, although
I am positive it *should*. We were in no way notified of a policy or reservation change during our stay. I have multiple emails from AirBnB confirming our 11am checkout time.

I have a ticket open with AirBnB currently to determine if there is a change control
process in place that would provide us logs for when this change took place. I doubt they will be able to provide this.

---

Abbreviated timeline of events following the incident:

- We send copies of our vet records to the short term rental owner and to the cleaning company
- The municipality's animal control calls me a week later as a ""routine follow-up"" 
- A personal injury firm has contacted me on behalf of the cleaner (not the company, the individual who claims to have been bitten) demanding my personal liability insurance
- Third-party AirBnB claims agent contacts me to take a statement as I assume the personal injury firm has sent the same type of legal threat to the owner, who has turned it over to AirBnB ...insurance?
- Today I get another letter saying they are about to file a complaint in Montana

**So** what do I need to do here? 
- Hand it over to my home owners, pay that deductible, and let them pay it out? Will they dispute it for me?
- Have my attorney draft up something to send back? I have emails and images from the property suggesting that it was not our negligence that led to the incident.
- Just see what they want to settle for? What is the average settlement for something like this?",legaladvice,False,now100handed,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi4723/airbnb_owner_changes_policy_midstay_dog_bites/

74,(NC) Is it possible to adopt my wifes daughter without contacting the biological father?,1589258249,"This is my situation: my wife and I are living together with our daughter. I am 25, wife is 26, daughter is 6. 

We have been living together roughly 6 years, and have been married now for 1 year. The entire time of which, I have been the primary provider and my wife has had jobs in the past.

She has never received child support, nor has she ever tried to file for it. The biological fathers name is not on the birth certificate, nor has he ever signed any documents from doctors/teachers etc. I have always been the one to sign as her guardian if it came up (my name is not on the birth cert.), and I have been providing financial support since she was around 3 months old.

The bio father has only provided a pack of diapers years ago, and I believe held her as a baby once, since then has not attempted contact, nor we him. That's the way we prefer it, tbh. 

I want to adopt our child, but I dont want to risk sparking a legal battle. If I can do it quietly and quickly, with no negative effects for the child, then I want to. But I can also wait, I'm in no rush. I'm her father in all but the legal sense.


Other possibly relevant information:

Our child has mild/moderate autism. Her favorite hobby is trying to escape the house, for that reason our house is equipped with special locks/alarms on the doors/windows, GPS smartwatch etc.

Unfortunately, we have had 2 previous run ins with CPS because she is so smart, and found our keys while we were sleeping and went on her adventure. Both times, we worked with CPS and they did necessary inspections and deemed us fit to keep parenting her. That's when we installed all the extra security stuff.

She has speech therapy at school, and has been receiving speech therapy since around 1.5~2 yo. (I'm just trying to include all the things that might not apply to most kids).

She is receiving disability benefits for her autism.

The bio father possibly has a criminal record, but I'm unsure how to check. Probably drug related, nothing serious like murder.

79,Can I back out of a real estate contract if I am able to prove fraud on the disclosure form?,1589257628,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I had gotten fairly far along in the process of buying a home. The closing date arrives, and I am randomly told that I need to get flood insurance. It turns out the home was in a flood zone, AE, which is a high risk flood zone.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a question on the disclosure asking : ""Is the residence located within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) mandating the purchase of flood insurance for federally backed mortgages?""

&amp;#x200B;

To this, they answered ""unknown."" 

&amp;#x200B;

However by asking for the seller's proof of flood insurance (not sure why they gave it to me, honestly...), I was given the seller's policy declaration for their flood insurance. It is dated 2017. It has the seller's name, the property address and details, flood policy details, and information about the flood zone. It also discloses their mortgage lender and the loan ID as well as the flood policy ID.  It shows renewal dates and even lists the ""community program,"" which is part of the FEMA backed NFIP.

&amp;#x200B;

They clearly knew it was in a flood zone as this is clear proof they purchased the flood insurance due to having a mortgage. I signed and sent a release form today, but I am wondering if they could try to sue. Paranoid they may not sign the form. They initially told my real estate agent they would fight me on it. They tried to contact my lender to get my appraisal but they were denied this, and then they called my real estate agent with an offer to pay for a year of my flood insurance. I did not take it.

80,What can I do about hospital bill and misdiagnosis/negligence?,1589257533,"This might be kind of a long post so I apologize in advance.

About half a year ago, I came down with a ringworm fungal infection after adopting a new kitten from a shelter. The presentation of this infection was very extreme, there were huge, painful, itchy welts and they had spread all over my body. I went to a dermatologist, an urgent care facility, doctor on demand, and even the ER because no one could figure out definitively what was wrong with me and couldn't treat me for this horrible infectious skin condition. The dermatologist thought it was a bacterial staph infection, the urgent care had no idea, the ER doctor just guessed. It was only the $20 doctor on doctor on demand, who actually listened to me (I suspected it to be ringworm) and prescribed me an antifungal that cleared my infection up. The emergency room visit angered me the most because I waited for an hour for the doctor to examine me, and he looked at me for less than 10 minutes and said he can't be sure but it's most likely shingles and prescribed me some steroids and sent me home. I told him that I suspected it's ringworm because of my new cat and he said no he doesn't think so. He didn't do any tests or take any samples. He just gave me his best guess, and told me to go home. This whole experience just obliterated my trust in the healthcare system and providers because it really felt like no one cared and just wanted to get me out the door ASAP.

Anyways, a few months later, I received 2 bills for my visits to the ER, which I thought was very strange. The bills were from providers with similar names, Texas Health Resources and Texas Medicine Resources. I did a quick google search and one was associated with the hospital/emergency room I went to. And the other came up empty (no websites, no office, no records) except for some google reviews saying that it was a scam. So I paid the hospital bill that I could verify and just left the other one, assuming it was a scam or something, which now I realize was a mistake.

Fast forward to now, I received a letter saying that my debt has been sent to a collection agency. I'm confused and outraged because here I am thinking that I paid the hospital! So I dug back through my paperwork and found the insurance claims. One was for the emergency room bill which was $360 for Emergency Room Services. The one I thought fake was for 'Medical Visit' for $502 ($320ish with insurance). Apparently it's a separate bill for the doctor who saw me.

I knew that it would be expensive going to the emergency room but I was desperate not knowing what was wrong with me and the symptoms were only getting worse. I was prepared to pay the bill to the hospital. But now they're telling me that I owe $700 for spending an hour in the ER, sitting in a chair for the most of it, and for the 10 minutes that this doctor examined me, ignored my input, and then MISDIAGNOSED ME.

Half of me wants to just pay the rest of this bill just to make it go away, but the other half is screaming that this is outrageous. Maybe I wouldn't even mind if I felt like the doctor at least TRIED to help me, but he dismissed what I had to say and ended up giving me a wrong diagnosis because of it, which made the visit a complete waste of time. So I want to know if there's anything I can do at this point since it has already been sent to a debt collector? Should I try to fight this or just pay it and move on with my life?

86,"Question as a tenant [CA], what are my legal rights in this situation?",1589256656,"So I lived here over a year, in los angeles county we just agree on month to month. The house is divided in two. The tenants in the front had a contract that ended we pay the tenants so he can pay the realtor, who probably pays the owner of the house. So basically all of use are month to month tenants now. My question is the owner wants to put the house on sale and that is ok. I have no issues with moving out.

My only problem is the tenant of the front part of the house has agreed to let them take photos and videos of the inside of his part and I have chosen not to let them because I really have expensive equipment in my backyard and inside my home and I want my privacy because of that. I work almost everyday and find it difficult to prepare the house for any pictures or video. I let the front tenant know that they should let the realtor know of my decision, but he said he doesn't know what's going to happen as if they can come and take photos and videos without my consent. I let them know basically 3 weeks ago of my decision. They refused to give me the realtor's contact number to let him know myself. And just yesterday the tenant told me that the photographer is coming on friday. I have bought no trespassing signs to set up in the back, I hope that it works and I hope that no one takes them down or ignores them. All I want is help with this situation. What rights do I have here and what kind of agreement I can make so it can benefit both of us. Do I have have any rights as a month to month tenant.

I mainly worry about my expensive equipment and if photos are posted they can be easily stolen because they are not secured. I don't have enough for storage right now and I live alone and my equipment is heavy. If it comes to them showing the house what can I do to prevent them from doing so, so I can have my privacy and not have my equipment stolen. Another concern of mine is when they start showing the house if I have not been evicted yet what are my rights to privacy as well, if I am evicted within the few months what can I do. I was not working as much because of the corona virus but I was still paying as much as I could come up with .

I'm kind of lost here with all that is happening and would like some experience perspective. I have kept the house clean and undamaged because I want to be a good tenant so I am expecting some respect and privacy in return. Sorry for the ramble I just need these things to be cleared up.

92,Trying to protect our children from their grandparents,1589255671,"I have been searching this sub off and on for months but have yet to read about a situation similar to the one my husband and I are currently in. We could really use some help. The simplest way to explain it is that his parents are horrible people. They are manipulative, selfish, and very emotionally abusive. My husband is still dealing with trauma from his childhood and he is now in his late thirties. He has tried numerous times over the years to start a conversation with them about trying to have a better relationship. They always get defensive and upset and the conversation goes nowhere. I can provide more details if that would help or you can read my post history if that helps to explain things.

He was married once before and shares 50/50 custody of two young children with his exwife. 

Last year he and I made the decision to cut off contact with his parents. It was very difficult to say the least. We both felt that it was necessary to protect ourselves and most importantly the kids from further abuse. My husband wrote them a long email stating why he was doing this. He told them that he did not want to be contacted by them through phone calls, texts, video calls, messaging apps, or in person. He told them not to contact me or the children. His exwife was informed of the situation and, at the time, said that she understood why he would do that because she had horrible experiences with them while they were married.

Ever since he sent the email his parents have still tried to communicate with us. We have had to block their numbers on our phones and have deleted FaceTime and messaging apps on our devices as well as the kids devices. They have sent us things by mail. They have sent other family members to try and guilt us into talking with his parents. They have used every excuse and opportunity to reach out to us. We have never responded to anything.

Here is our main problem-his exwife still allows my in-laws to see the children. She knows my husband does not want them to be around his parents. Despite this she still brings the kids over to visit them during her custody time.

My husband and I are very worried about this. We know that legally his exwife has control over who the kids see during her parenting time.

2,Dell refuses to refund faulty laptop.,1589254631,"I'm in Australia. I purchased an XPS 15 7590 in November 2019 (so about 7-8 months ago) and yesterday it started overheating and crashing while just browsing online and running a word document.

It got to the point where the laptop won't even startup and the LED is flashing 1 white, 2 amber, indicating a CPU/Motherboard failure.

This is a big deal for me as I run an online business as my main source of income and am currently a student. So not having a laptop is making things difficult.

I contacted Dell to ask for a refund as, under Australian consumer law, I believe this is a 'major failure' and that entitles the customer to their choice of repair, replacement, or refund. I wanted a refund as I believe the repair will take too long and even if done well, I might have to deal with the same issue 7 months down the line, which would be outside of warranty. ( I can't afford to buy another one)

Dell replied with, "" The system has been in use for 8 months. With no dispatch history or opportunity to resolve the issue, under Australian Consumer Law, we can always offer service as a resolution. For now, we'll continue to archive this case. This can be reopened within the next 10 days if you decide to change your mind.""

3,Paying back sign-on bonus and threatening to contact current employer? Is this legal?,1589254593,"I know w'ere all busy, so I'll keep it short and sweet:

I began working at a company in the Bay Area, California, in the middle of August 2019. It’s a small to medium sized start-up. In my employment agreement, which I signed, it stated I must return my sign-on bonus in the event my employment with this company ends, for any reason, within 12 months.

Come March 31st, I am laid off due to COVID-19. As I’ve only worked at the company for 8 months, they want me to return my $10,000 sign-on bonus ($6,200 net of taxes). So I review my original employment agreement, and it does not state a specific date at which this $6,200 must be returned. It states the following, “Any such bonus payments made would be payable back to Company if your employment with Company is terminated, for any reason, before 12 months from start date.” That’s it.

Flash forward to today, and I’m struggling to come to agreement with this employer as to when this money will be returned. It peaked when I received an email today stating that:

* My previous employer will contact my new employer 
* My previous employer will be contacting their lawyers

Unless I repay the $6,200 immediately. So my questions are as follows:

1. Can my previous employer contact my current employer, and if so, what can they legally tell my current employer? What would they even say? (Note: I have never gave permission to my previous employer to contact my current employer, and my current employer reached out to my previous employer when performing a background check before I was hired. I don’t believe they ever successfully contacted my previous employer.)
2. If my previous employer contacts their lawyers, what would likely happen? How, if at all, could they force me to return the $6,200 immediately given that my employment agreement does not specify a date at which this money must be returned?

* Would a lawyer even take this case (I don’t think the company retains legal counsel)

3. Could I theoretically never payback the $6,200 without punishment given the agreement language?

4. What would you do?

One of my buddies is a business transactions lawyer, and he thinks the threat to contact my current employer is hot air, stating it would give me the opportunity to pursue a defamation / libel lawsuit. That being said, our leadership team is from India and may not be aware of these laws. Moreover, I’m pretty sure they write all employee contracts without legal review, which explains why there is no payback date in my employment agreement. 

Any advice is appreciated. I worked my ass off at this company and know firsthand how dishonest the leadership team is, so I’d like to fight it as much as I could without putting myself at serious risk.

4,How to leave my LLC in Wisconsin.,1589254473,"Last year, a friend and I formed an LLC in Wisconsin. We were working as subcontractors for a construction company, so the LLC was necessary.

Everything I could find said I only had to do this in writing. I’m not sure how else to disassociate with the LLC. 

I have recently gotten phone calls from the WI Department of Revenue, I have not spoken to anyone. Just gotten voicemails to call back which I have ignored. I also got mail addressed to the company at my home address, which I have sent back after writing “not at this address” on the envelope. 

I think my friend has not paid taxes for 2019. I don’t know for sure because we don’t talk business anymore. My choice, because I do not want to be involved. I did send him an IRS form in January to officially change the address of the business, and to make him the sole owner. I do not know if he sent this in.

I live in an apartment building in Maryland. Our building has a no smoking policy, both in the building and on the premises, parking lot, everywhere. A few people smoke cigs in the parking lot but whatever Ok, no big deal. 

Someone in the building smokes pot in their apartment. Often. And a lot of it. Strong smelling pot. Lots of people have complained so they send out an email about once a month to all residents reminding of the smoking policy. 

The problem has gotten worse. I went out to our shared laundry room over the weekend. Even with my covid mask, I literally choked and coughed on the smell. All my laundry smells like weed. 

I emailed our landlord and said I appreciate their efforts but something has to be done. They said they will send out another email. I said please do more obviously that has not been effective. 

The people usually smoke evenings and weekends, i assume because they know there is no staff on site. I’ve asked and the property managers are not willing to come outside of 9-5. 

I’ve considered calling the police but our states attorney recently announced they are not prosecuting marijuana cases anymore so I highly doubt the cops would even come. I guess I could try anyway. 

I worry that these people may have other drugs, may have people coming in and out to buy drugs, etc. I don’t want my shit smelling like pot anymore.

8,"Just moved into an apartment complex 3 weeks ago, now they're telling me they'll fine me if I dont' remove the (long) pre-existing weeds on the patio. Can they?",1589254167,"As the title mentions, we've only been at this residence for about three weeks. 

In that time, there have been a lot of incidences indicating ongoing disorganization on the part of the management. E.g.  being woken up by repairmen who had the wrong unit or being issued a written notice for what turned out to be an ""offense"" meant for my neighbor. 

During the most recent incident regarding the incorrectly issued citation, I was asked to send a photo of my patio (the area in question) to prove I hadn't committed the offense. I expressed frustration as this was already taking up a good portion of time but begrudgingly obliged. A day or so later I received an email apologizing for the mix up and saying that ""we would like to inform you that your patio looks perfect and we apologize for the error."" 

Now, I've gotten another written ""Notice of Lease Violation"" but this time directed towards me. Nothing on my patio has changed but now we're being reprimanded for the pre-existing weeds that have been there long before we have. These are small enough so they can only be seen from my apartment (but significant enough to be a pain to remove). Indicating to me they are issuing the citation via the photos I sent them. This is ridiculous because not only do *most* of my neighbors have these same weeds, I don't have gardening tools, am I really expected to go purchase whatever is necessary to pull them up? Again, they are no where near visible to anyone who passes by unless they're actively looking over our fence. And finally, this is a large complex and there are a *ton* of these ""violations"" out in the open. Of the 12 listed on the citation almost every single unit has at least one if not more of these ""violations"", so us being issued this seems arbitrary at best.


In summary, do they have the right to force me to spend money and perform labor on something they neglected before I arrived? Again, multitudes of other neighbors have these weeds but aren't being bothered by management.

In a lot of cases it's trivially easy to find the real girl's profile, like just a couple of minutes.

Some context: I'm a 22 year old university student and I live in Colombia so I guess everyone here can't do much to help me out with this, but I've read that there are some international rules that every bank must follow depending on the card brand, so maybe someone has those rules clear and can tell me if I can do something or not.

All of this started on October 3 2018. It was 8 pm and I was coming home from university in a bus, after I got on my stop, a guy basically kidnapped me for two hours threatening me with torturing/murdering me if I didn't do what he asked me to do. So I had to hand him my two credit cards, a VISA and a MasterCard that were offered to me because I was using my first credit card (the MasterCard one) responsibly, the VISA one had a topping of around 1000 USD at the time.

The thing is, I hadn't used that card ever, I hadn't even activated it after receiving it from the mail, but the bank had a part in the contract for the card that said that it would be activated automatically after delivery if I signed the contract. Well, I had obviously signed the contract because I wasn't worried about it, I was thinking about having a good credit score in the future just using the cards responsibly, until I got kidnapped.

So, after a lot of drama I managed to get out but I couldn't even file a police report (a great mistake, I didn't knew better then and my dad that studied Law didn't cared about reporting the crime thinking it would be useless, the worst part was that one of the band that kidnapped me was caught, but oh well), I blocked my cards and went to sleep. The next day I noticed that there were 5 charges to my VISA card that maxed the card, so I reported it to the bank and they said they couldn't do anything; even though I wasn't present, my card wasn't signed and the receipt of the purchase was never signed, the place where the purchases were made didn't check the customer's identity, the equivalent of my SSN was never compromised, and there were no evidence about the purchases being made other than what the bank reported to me.

26,Property ownership with sibling,1589252748,"I own a beach house in New Jersey with my sister that was left to us. It's worth about $250k, and costs about $8k annually in taxes.

My sister moved away and doesn't want to pay for taxes or anything anymore, but still owns the house with me. I am thinking that if she wants to retain ownership she needs to continue to pay half the taxes. Please tell me if my scenarios seem reasonable:

A) She continues to pay 50% of the annual taxes, but since she does not use the house I will agree to pay my half of the taxes, and all of the utilities and upkeep etc. This way she still has an equity stake in the house.

or

B) She can pay nothing, but will be entitled to 50% of the current value of the house and no longer have any affiliation with it (The means by which she would receive the $125k would have to be sorted out)

27,[ON] Night Terrors &amp; Police,1589252725,"Edit: Ontario

Hi!

I am trying to find a solution to a problem I hope I never actually have to face.

I have struggled with night terrors for the past 10 years give or take. A night terror for me usually means screaming bloody murder in the middle of the night for a few minutes, before either my husband or my pets wake me. I often lose my voice / have a raspy voice like I'd been at a concert because of it.

I have zero memory of the ""dream"" afterwards. I am often disoriented, sobbing hysterically &amp; have had aggressive moments before being fully awake.  Sometimes my husband seriously struggles to pull me out of one and it can get ... Intense. 

We live in a townhouse, so we share walls and yards with several neighbours (🇨🇦). I'm basically terrified that the police is going to show up and arrest my husband in the middle of the night for DV. I thought about talking to our neighbours and warning them, but:

1) that may come across the exact opposite way I want it to
2) there's a language barrier
3) I really don't want strangers knowing my medical history
4) I don't want to stop anyone from calling the police if they think there's a potential emergency!

If I was a cop and got a call about possible DV  and found a hysterical woman, a pissed off dude and a protective dog... I'd definitely have alarm bells going on 🚩

Can I do anything to be prepared in case this happens?",legaladvice,False,Redditrambles1,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi2sov/on_night_terrors_police/

31,"Aunt tricked dad into putting his name down signing her car then took off with it abandoning her family, now speeding tickets and parking violations are being mailed for him to pay for.",1589252238,"We live in California and this all started almost 2 years ago. My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and in the middle of his chemotherapy treatment my aunt, who’s 50 years old and was never really apart of our life growing up except for the occasional family parties and funerals, decided to start coming by more and spending time with her brother. 

We appreciated her for that during that time but that changed because every time she came over it was nothing but drama and complaining about her kids being lazy and her husband trying to control or kill her ( I’ve sat down and spent an hour listening to her ramble about her husband hacking into her phone or sending cars to follow her). We figured she was on drugs and but we didn’t know how bad it was and none of her kids or her husband responded when we tried reaching out to tell them about her. 

Anyways, she got a stable job as a caretaker being paid by the state and comes over talking about needing a new car and she has the money for a down payment she just needs a co-signer cause her credit is bad but everyone she’s asked said no. My dad wanted to be nice and help her since she was coming over to check on him, got a job and is his sister. She assured him she will put the down payment and pay the monthly payments and picked a 2017 Nissan Rogue. 

Aunt came to get him in the morning to sign the paperwork at the dealers and while he was under the assumption he was just co-signing we found out later he actually signed for full ownership and she signature was nowhere. When we asked him what happened at the dealership he said he was tired and confused and just asked his sister and she reassured him. 
The next 3 months she didn’t pay or didn’t have the money, got the car repossessed then paid to get it back. 

My mom finally had it and confronted her about her irresponsible behavior and her obvious drug problem but aunt denied everything and left the house. After that she didn’t come by for a while and we heard from cousins she had taken off and living out of that car by the beach somewhere. 

Then the parking and speeding tickets started to get mailed to our place in my dads name stating he had to pay. One was from metro for using the express lane (multiple times) that my dad appealed but was advised they couldn’t do anything cause it’s under his name and the best thing to do is buy a pass for the car in case she did it again which she did, and the latest one is from Long Beach for parking violation.

32,My mental health can’t take it anymore,1589252192,"Couple weeks ago I posted [this](https://reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gctov9/im_not_sure_if_i_should_lawyer_up/) and got little response. They were all saying that I should lawyer up, which I get the point. 

Today my wife informed me that she will be filing the divorce tomorrow morning (by paying the lawyer with all of our family savings which I’m going to cash out first thing in the morning) and the lawyers that she talked to pretty much told her she can fuck up my life and my future relationship with my kids and she can walk away with it after all that she did to me.

I would like to give some background as I have nobody else to talk to other than here and I hope that someone will help me how to save my ass from her abuse as I don’t find what her lawyer pretty much guaranteed her to be “fair” to me.

My wife had a pretty shitty life growing up as she described to me with a lot of drama involved. The main take aways from her past is that she had an abusive drug addict mother with lots of stories about how she(mother) ruined people’s lives that got into her mother’s life (not gonna get in details just including because I find it related). Her dad was also meth addict with lots of stories on his end.

When the parents were like these, my wife and her siblings went from shelter to step families up until her blood related uncle and his rich ass wife took responsibilities for them. These step parents were pretty much taking care of them with their unlimited money but they weren’t spoiling them so they had to figure out a lot on their own. My wife and her siblings were kind of stubborn and I noticed that they were all just jealous of each other’s lives. Out of all siblings my wife stood out with the most success getting license to become a CNA and fighting to be on her own. This was the story my stupid ass fell in love with because I always found strong woman attractive. 

Fast forward to first kid: it was the end of my master’s years when she got accidentally pregnant. I was already panicking about my thesis and actually out the end to it while she was in 17hours labor. We had the first kid then post-partum depression hit with no help around as we moved to different state due to my PhD. We fought hard to survive and actually gotten little better as I flew up my family from Turkey for help. Right after they left that’s when we made the second kid because life was going okay and we thought we could have one more close in age and be done and over with. Well it was a mistake to try to finish PhD and leave your pregnant wife home with a toddler. Stress came with everything was too much to handle and I couldn’t take it anymore and I quit PhD and came back to Jax where we know we have at least her step parents. Thankfully, they bought us a house here and I started looking for a job.

After 3 months of searching I was able to find a great position but it was in Ohio. I talked to her and got green light as the company was planning to move to Florida in the next 6 months and they also offered covering of travel expenses biweekly. So I was flying back and forth every 10 days to see my wife and kids for 4 days. During this time I had to leave my wife with two toddlers this time back home and flew my family from Turkey again for help. Well this time it was crap ton of fighting and it got to the point that she kicked my mom and dad out of the house in the middle of the night while I was in Ohio. As you could guess I quit that job and had to come back to Jax one more time and look for another job with little bit of experience. Finally I feel like I found a great job here that I’m still working and I get great feedback about my performance. I get to see my kids for lunch everyday and I don’t have to worry about work on weekends. So that’s today.

Let me explain how the shit went down too quickly as well. Couple months ago, she told her brother that the house we live in was purchased by her step parents and he lost his temper due to jealousy. The whole reason house was purchased in the first place was because I have a future that they believe in and they never did this to him because he recently got arrested for having 10 pounds of weed and some cocaine in the back of his truck. He also has extreme bipolar disorder along with some other mental issues. When we told the step parents about what happened and the rich step mom made a comment about my wife’s brother’s mental health, my wife also lost her temper and told her to get the fuck away from her life. Since then we stopped all the communications and my wife told me that if I ever bring kids around them she would file a divorce and get the kids away from me. She then proceed with mailing the step mom about cutting all the financial ties with them including giving back the house. I kind of disagreed as it was a great investment for us especially kids and we aren’t ready to get our own house with credits we have. Later we learned that we don’t have any legal bindings to them as they purchased the house directly to our names but my wife never stopped pushing to give everything back. The more I tried to explain we can’t afford it, the worse everything became. Now we are at a point that she uses my kids against me and telling me that if I don’t sell the house and give everything back she would take full custody and move the kids out of state because her lawyers told her she can. Apart from this, she already called 911 on me once, threatened me with ruining my green card and sending me back to my country, took kids into car and cancelled her location sharing with me and constantly making me feel like shit front of them and when I get angry she just acts the sweetest mom so that they stay away from me. I feel bad almost everyday that I want to call for help because I’m scared that I’m gonna be doing something bad to myself or lose what I worked so hard for. She is diagnosed with ADD/ADHD (I’m also thinking she has bipolar like her sister and brother) and quit taking meds long time ago. I know that she abused drugs before(also has DUI/reckless driving on her records), but I have no way of proving in any shape or form. I got so clueless on what to do due to my own schedule with work that I keep a fully charged gopro in case I lose my temper and do something bad one day so I have a record for my kids.

I work full time and do my best with chores but she never fully satisfied if they’re not done with the way she does no matter how hard I try just to have a good day with my kids. She already called 911 on me once, threatened me with ruining my green card and sending me back to my country and filing for divorce almost everyday. Simply she’s just a living cancer for me.

Before this situation is understood as me being hungry for someone else’s money, I would like to say that we were paying the family back every month even though we don’t have to and I talked to couple banks and our monthly payments for mortgage would be 3 times more than what we pay them back.

The situation is actually about an abusive wife who happened to be mother of my two children who constantly uses them against me in this country I came to get my education. I’m simply seeking any legal advice I can do to get a better deal than 30% time with my kids and I want to bring her abuse into attention by maybe using her mental state.

In January of 2019, I moved into a house full of college students where I never signed any legal documents, was not part of any lease, or made any written contract with any of the girls there. Anything that was said or done was verbal.

I moved an hour away from my hometown to go to college. I was contacted by one of the girls telling me there was a room available. I declined at first when the price was too high for me. They found another girl who could share the room with me, so I became interested. I went to look at the room/house and decided I would like to move in. 

Originally, they discussed a deposit with me and first month's rent. They also said I would be signing a lease once I moved there. Then there was no word of any lease. The other girls were always under a lease, but me and the girl I shared the room with were never made to sign anything or to join the lease. Her and I split the cost of the full deposit and rent for the one room (a master bedroom).

Around August of 2019, their lease was up and they were going to renew it. They asked everyone living there at the time to be a part of the lease, as only two of the original girls on the lease were left, and wanted everyone on board. All of us but one girl sent applications to the property management company. I heard nothing back.

I had the intention to move out twice, starting at the beginning of this year, as many issues developed/arised with them. First time I said I wanted to move out, one of the original girls of the lease said I would have to find a replacement in order to move out. She also said I was on the lease so I'd be violating it. As far as I knew, I had never signed anything. I called the company, they told me I was not on the lease, but they had my application. They even asked if I wanted to be on the lease, I said no. I confronted the girl about this who always insisted I had to find a replacement. They also all made me feel bad for wanting to just ""leave them"" so I stayed.

Coronavirus happened and a lot of things changed for me. School was online, graduation canceled. My plans had changed. I decided in March I wanted to move out in April, before May. They definitely did not like this. They always made me feel bad for wanting to move out. Again, they insisted I needed to find a replacement. I was told many times by others that it's not my obligation. They also said it was on me to find someone, and they couldn't me find someone due to the dangers of coronavirus. They accused me of wanting to leave because it was now convenient, that I would be responsible for my part of the rent if I left, and they even threatened legal action. They wanted me to ""compromise"" and atleast help with some part because, again, it was my responsibility.

We broke our lease because of a presence of cockroaches in our top floor unit due to landlord negligence- we told him about the issue in January and since then we’ve documented their presence, we broke the lease after telling him in a formal sort of way demanding that he fix the issue but he still denied the issue so we formally announced we’re breaking the lease after a 14 day period.

He sent us those overnight express packages which are designed for letters and when we opened one of them it was empty with no information regarding what they were for, we have another one of them unopened and it doesn’t seem like there’s anything inside of it. This was after we left the lease. 


My questions are, 

Is what he’s doing legal? 
Is there any way we can defend ourselves? 
Can he damage out credit score? 
What should our next steps be? 
Are those packages supposed to be empty? 

If there’s any more information that’s necessary please let me know I’ll try helping as much as possible.

So, my dog went in about 3 weeks ago for bloodwork. It came back okayish. Nothing note worthy.

The following week was an emergency spay and mass removal of a mammary tumor. Shes a 7 year old German Shepherd, she falls under the ""older"" spectrum. 

The surgery went fine as far as I know, she woke up fine and came home. I was informed of the blood pooling where the tumor was. There was an over direction of bloodflow, so she still was bleeding. She was given Carprofen (rimadyl), which is KNOWN to have worse effect on older dogs. She was given pill form AND injection! She was never given antibiotics. On the third day, she started having a reaction. Diarrhea and vomiting, and she went to the emergency vet. She did not show signs of being anemic or having internal bleeding. They gave her antibiotics, and non Nsaids.

The following day, I took her to a regular vet, not the original one who did the surgery. Where they diagnosed her with Anemia. Her gums turned white in less than 24 hours.

49,Employer lied to me costing me 3 weeks of pay. Their solution to compensate me seems unethical. Is this legal?,1589250585,"So, after hearing I would be furloughed by my company I looked into unemployment benefits and saw for one of the reasons I did not qualify for unemployment. I brought this to Human Resources attention and she word for word said that should not matter and I will qualify so don’t worry. 

So, I applied and sat around because the compensation I would get from unemployment would be enough until I came back. 

Sure enough I got denied. 

After I expressed my frustration, their solution to compensate me is to bring me back on for a couple of days a week and compensate with the rest with the Families first covid 19 act 80 hours. But I read into that eligibility and I do not qualify once again. 

After bringing this up to them, they said my company has the final decision whether I get that compensation and if the government finds out I’m not eligible, it would fall on my company not me. 

So, it sounds like they are going to lie about me not being able to work (or telework). I was working from home prior to the furlough. And the paper they want me to sign says I am unable to work from home. So would I be responsible because I am lying as well? 

My gut tells me not to sign the paper, but who do I bring this up with and do I have legal action available to me?

50,Short Term Rental Refund / County Banned All Short Term Rentals,1589250540,"I booked a weekend stay for a group at a rental property for March 20-23rd on VRBO. They sent me a separate contract to my email which I signed and returned to them. Due to Covid, we deemed it unsafe to go and tried to cancel. VRBO's stance is you have to contact the homeowner directly for refunds. 

&amp;#x200B;

The home is managed by a company, which we contacted. They were not offering refunds, but allowed us to reschedule. Luckily the ONLY other weekend we are able to do this, they had available. The management company initiated the cancellation on VRBO, and I was refunded the VRBO booking fee.

&amp;#x200B;

The management company then sent me the following email:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello XXX,  


Thank you for reserving HOME NAME from 06/12/2020 at 03.00 PM to 06/15/2020 at 11.00 AM.  


We look forward to your stay with us. Please click on the following link to review and accept the rental agreement for your reservation. As a reminder, this must be returned today to secure your dates.  


View Rental Agreement (this was a link to the new agreement)  


Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any further questions at all.  


Thank you for choosing COMPANY NAME!""

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if its relevant, but the management company is now handling this ""new"" booking privately outside of VRBO. I have yet to sign the new contract. Since I reserved these new dates, the county that the rental property is in has banned all short term rentals (60 days or less) until June 19th. So obviously, its not happening.... but now there is no other weekend that we can go, and rescheduling is not an option.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive been sifting through the contracts, both the original and the new one are almost the same.... the new one has the following added:

**""CANCELLATION AND REFUND WAIVER:** At the direction of the County of XXX and local health authorities, multiple events have been rescheduled and/or cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns. Licensee’s option of cancellation with any type of refund is hereby revoked and once this Agreement is signed the Licensee may cancel at anytime with a zero percent (0%) refund. This Agreement hereby renders any and all previously signed and/or agreed to Agreements, Terms and Conditions (online, digital or hard copy) null and void and this Agreement is in full effect.""

Again, I have not signed the new agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, both agreements have the following in them:

""38. EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES: There may be circumstances in which the Property might not be available for your stay. Examples of these include (but are not limited to) destruction of or damage to the Property, changes in local occupancy regulations, or other reasons. In the event the Property is not available, for whatever reason, we will do our best to make alternative arrangements for you where possible. If we cannot, or if the alternative arrangements are not acceptable to you, then we will refund all monies paid. This will be the full extent of our liability to you in such circumstances, and we will not be responsible for any other costs connected with any such cancellation, howsoever arising.""

I'm wondering if since the county has banned all short term rentals, AND that gatherings of 10 or more are also not allowed, that technically this would fall under ""circumstances in which the Property might not be available for your stay"" and ""changes in local occupancy regulations"". Technically the house is not available due to law.

55,[NC] How can my brother keep his kids?,1589249637,"Hi all, firstly I recognize this is all coming from a very biased stand point, but I am looking for some knowledge and/or assistance.

My brother left his wife today after being married for around 2.5 years. They have two children together and she has another child from a previous relationship. 

They were very much not a good couple, and I would consider his wife to be emotionally abusive to my brother and the kids. She is a very rampant alcoholic, and I believe the both of of them smoke pot on a semi regular basis. She is not employed, my brother is. She also claims that one of her sons is autistic, which in my very unprofessional opinion, is simply not true. She very often neglects the children, does not encourage them to do well in school and refuses to work/provide for them. 

After several months of debating on leaving her, today my brother pulled the trigger. 

Is there anything he can do to get his two children through the separation that is required in NC? Barring that, is there anything he can do to be the “main” (where the spend most time with him) guardian of his kids? I know he most likely has no say over what happens to the child from a previous relationship.

57,I'm a consultant working for medical device company. Company is suddenly dissolving my position after I sent an email raising concerns about lack of PPE that is needed for us to continue to safely do our jobs. I am my team's most tenured consultant. Not part of any company-wide lay-offs.,1589249480,"I intend to consult with a few firms that were recommended by a friend (near *Philadelphia*) within the next few days, but before I did, I wanted to see if there is grounds for a case here, or just welcome input in general. I am a biomedical engineer, and unfortunately do not have much experience with the legal arena.

As a consultant, I travel to various hospitals within my territory to help surgeons use purchased tools and software for neurosurgery. This entails being present in the operating room to setup equipment, as well as directing surgeons and nurses during procedures.

Throughout February and until early march, the company I work for had been silent about any precautions or measures to be taken regarding the developing pandemic. I was not until I voiced to my immediate manager that the president of the company sent a company-wide email saying continue business as usual, and wash your hands, as large sites in the county where I live began to shut down in March.

After a couple of more weeks, my co-workers and I began to feel downright distressed that we were not being supplied N95 masks from our company, and I myself was denied even a basic surgical mask at a hospital in New Jersey (which had an alarmingly infection rate) that I traveled to, in order to upgrade some purchased software. This was after lock-down procedures began to be enforced, and this software upgrade was likely not essential to begin with, but my boss did not agree. I was also supporting a surgery at another hospital where the staff in the operating room were wearing PAPR respirators during an ENT procedure (which promoted aerosolized viral particulate matter spreading throughout the room), and, I only had a basic surgical mask to wear, which would not have adequately protected me from a covid-positive patient.

At this point, 6 other team members and I drafted an email, which I personally sent to our regional director citing OSHA guidelines, as well as internal safety trainings that specifically stated that it was the Employer's responsibility to provide adequate PPE for job-related responsibilities, among other safety concerns. Prior to this pandemic, we used hospital-supplied masks as part of aseptic technique measures for patient safety. However, now our own safety was at risk, and we needed adequate PPE to continue working during the constantly changing circumstances of this pandemic. We also requested more transparency as to how our company would be handling COVID-19 with regards to sick time and sanitation of our tools, etc.

After sending this email, the president of the entire US branch held a mandatory online meeting with ONLY my specific team, and not all US employees (again, lack of transparency) to re-iterate that it was the responsibility of the hospital (not my company) to provide PPE, and if a hospital did not supply us with the same level of PPE as their own staff, we should leave. Furthermore, it was our own responsibility to ensure we do not put ourselves in a jeopardizing position.

(just a side note) This put us OR support personnel an ethical dilemma, where hospitals were already lacking adequate stock of PPE, so for every N95 mask I take, that's one less that is available for a nurse desperately in need. This also put us in the awkward position of choosing to abandon surgeons who needed our help for neurosurgical procedures.


Fast-forward one month to today - I get a call from my (severely new and unqualified) manager that my position is suddenly being dissolved, and I can either take a demotion with significantly less pay, or I can leave with 6 week's severance. I am the most tenured and experienced person out of all the OR support personnel in my team, and our company is not undergoing any lay-offs. I do not have negative marks on my employment record, I work very hard and am respected by my peers. The VP also mentioned that my position is being dissolved, in part, to re-allocate funds for my manager's salary (who again is severely unqualified and arguably may be threatened by my level of experience). 

Is any of this grounds for wrongful termination of my position? Do I even have a chance at arguing this, with everything else going on?

58,Looking for advice on entering the paralegal field,1589249397,"Thanks for taking the time to read about my situation and give me some advice!

I'm a 21 y/o student based in the US and will be finishing up my Bachelor's Degree (History/IR) in December. Eventually, I want to complete a law degree and work in the non-profit sector, but I first need to pay down some student loans. After graduation I'm hoping to get a job as a paralegal in order to gain experience working in a firm environment and to confirm that a law degree is the path I want to dedicate time and funds to. To make myself more competitive I know I should complete some type of paralegal accreditation or certificate program. For flexibility, I am looking for an online option and not an in-person one. 

Some things I've understood about getting paralegal accreditation (please correct me on any of this):

* It is generally ""worth it"" to purse an ABA approved paralegal program
* These ABA approved programs are almost always in-person as opposed to online
* Fast-track certificate programs are generally not seen as comparable to paralegal degree programs–– though not all paralegals complete degree programs in their field

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to ask what advice you might have for me considering

* I want to start working soon after I graduate to pay off loans/begin saving for law school
* I don't see myself being a paralegal for an extended period of time (though this could of course change) 
* I would like to get my first job somewhere in the Southwest or Texas, though obviously I will go where I'm hired
* I'm willing to dedicate 30 weeks and 10 hours a week as an absolute maximum to pursuing paralegal credentials

Right now Boston University's Online Paralegal Certificate has caught my eye–– it's a 14 week program coming in at just under 4k, with books and WestlawNext included. Not ABA approved.

59,"[CA] My wife was arrested for domestic violence, and also put on a 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold for her acute manic episode. Should I be working with the district attorney to get her charges dropped?",1589249203,"First some background. My wife is in the middle of an acute manic episode and has been in and out of the psychiatric inpatient facility several times the past 2 months. She has no previous criminal history.

She recently got discharged from the psychiatric hospital since her condition improved significantly after taking medication. However, she stopped taking them almost immediately after discharge, and her condition got worse. I asked her politely if she wants to go see a doctor. She just looked at me, slapped me once (not hard), and started doing the same things that made me very concerned about her own safety.

I called 911, and explained the situation to the police. Police put another 5150 hold, but they also arrested her for domestic violence, even if I profusely argued that I don't want this charge on her and I think it's unnecessary. My wife was transferred to jail and never contacted me or any one else while she was there.

The district attorney called me before the arraignment hearing, and said she will recommend to the judge that the charges be dropped if she gets psychiatric treatment. She also recommended a peaceful contact order between me and my wife and I agreed. At the arraignment hearing, the defense attorney who was hired by my wife's aunts requested a no-contact order and that she gets released to her aunt's house. The judge agreed with the defense. The domestic violence charge has not been dropped yet.

I'm sure the no contact order was the Aunt's idea, not my wife, because they believe I'm the cause of her disease (which of course is nonsense). To be clear, I want my wife to be able to talk to me and I'm the ""protected"" individual in the order.

I don't want to talk to the defense attorney since he has the interest of the Aunts who do not like me. The district attorney has been helpful, and is helping me downgrade the no-contact order to a peaceful-contact order. I have been giving updates to the district attorney regarding my wife, but I'm not sure if I should.

Questions:

1) Should I hire a private attorney instead, and stop talking to the district attorney even though the DA has been helpful? The DA's job is to prosecute, and I don't want my wife to get any criminal records. 

2) Was it illegal for the aunts to ask the defense attorney to request a no-contact order on behalf of my wife? I'm 100% sure my wife and the aunts did not exchange any information. What are my options here?

I'm not asking about how to take care of my wife and how she can get psychiatric help. NAMI is a great organization and resource for those who are in a similar situation.

I recorded about 5 minutes of him trimming and pushing the droppings onto my garden. I understand there are laws that say branches that extend over my property line would still be my responsibility to clean but is it fine for him to push his trimmings onto my side deliberately? For example, a branch falls towards his side and lands on top of the bush. He would then pick it up and throw it over onto my side.

What are his options?",1589248304,"(MN:) A friend of mine is currently in the process of getting divorced from his wife, and it is starting to get nasty.  He and his wife are living apart, and he is employed while she is not.  She recently spent $10,000 dollars getting veneers for her teeth.  She claims her teeth were chipping and it was necessary (we believe it absolutely wasn't), and that she planned this before the divorce papers were served.  She also made no mention of this until he saw the charge on their shared credit card, of which she is the primary name.

In years past they have spoken casually about her getting veneers, but never anything definite.  My friend cannot out right prove that she is doing this to either spite him and/or get as much money out of him before they divorce, but we are personally certain this is the case.

What are my friend's options?  Our weak understanding of divorce law means assets are typically frozen or heavily scrutinized, so this seems blatantly illegal/immoral.

Fast forward to a few weeks later where I was informed I needed another urgent procedure ( though relatively minor) but as I was in blood thinners , i had to wait to get a more senior anesthetist because of the PE’s and heart related issues arising from first op.

Anesthetist was aware I was on blood thinners and so said to continue to take blood thinner Rivoroxaban  and also order a different blood thinner the day prior to operation ect. -  Clexane bit I thought it was a blot clotting drug .

Long story short , the day after the operation I started hemorrhaging  and had to be sent to the nearest major hospital 130 kms away priority one.  I lost 3 liters of blood and had to have emergency surgery  to stop the bleeding .
In the wake of this , doctors and nurses have questioned why I was still advised to take the blood thinners , I thought the Clexane I was given the day prior and on the op day was a blot clotting drug so didn’t question it?

She recently found a new ""job"", but her new employer claims to be unable to pay her until July for more than 8 hours per week at the rate my friend negotiated for.

They told her as soon as they are able to, they'd give her back pay and convert her to a paid employee.

This sounds suspicious to me. But what I'm more curious about is once she gets the back pay, if it ever comes, will the hours she worked as a volunteer count against her unemployment benefits, and then constitute fraud?

83,Interrogatory/Discovery dispute (Maryland),1589247046," 

This minor child has been in my primary care and custody for 8 years. Her father and I separated when she was 2 and I have been her sole provider since that time. Father has never sought formalized custody and has never paid child support. I was unable to establish paternity until last month, so was never able to file for child support, a fact that he regularly used to throw in my face that he was ""untouchable."" He was charged with assault against the minor child 2 years ago, sentenced to PBJ, ordered to complete parenting class. Complied with his punishment and after a period of time, our informal sharing of the minor child resumed. Since that time he has moved in with an alcoholic who regularly gets drunk in my child's presence. The two of them argue, both physically and verbally, in front of her. The girlfriend is confrontational towards my child, calling her a bitch where my child could hear her, and making faces at my child behind her father's back. The girlfriend was also regularly harassing me via text message. Last summer, her father and his girlfriend got into a fight that turned physical while my child was in the car, her father grabbed the girlfriend to attempt to stop her from exiting a moving vehicle, and the girlfriend turned around and physically grabbed my child who was seated in the backseat of the car (While she had the door open of a moving vehicle). Following this event, I immediately ceased all visitation and decided that my child was not going back. I filed charges for the assault on my daughter and for the harassment. The assault charge was not pursued by the district attorney, as they didn't want to put my child through the experience of having to testify as they said it was traumatic. They did prosecute for harassment, and the girlfriend was sentenced to 6 months supervised probation, probation before judgement, and alcohol screening/treatment. A few months later (November), I was served with court paperwork that her father had filed for joint custody. He somehow retained a lawyer (Even though he could never afford to contribute financially to our child-interesting) and the lawyer has been ridiculously critical ever since. They sent over interrogatories and discoveries (which I understand is standard practice). I answered them to the best of my ability (Family law clinics are closed, covid 19). Got in the mail today a good faith letter to avoid discovery dispute requesting all health records since birth (8 years worth??!), and all my bank statements for the past 3 years. I am in no way going to provide these two things. I have provided everything else. When he responded to discovery/interrogatories he sent over like 3 documents. I feel like they are pushing me around since I am pro se. My question is, do I have to provide bank statements? I have provided pay stubs, tax returns, account information, copies of all my bills. 3 years of bank statements is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion, especially since he was not compliant with this request for discovery either.

84,Previous owner reported the car stolen after we acquired the title. Now our car has been towed,1589246920,"I will try to keep the story short, but this starts out like most car scams: buying on craigslist.

I live in LA and have personally bought and sold around 4 vehicles on Craigslist. Last Friday night (May 5th) I saw an ad on the site for a 2018 Bmw 5 series for a deal that I simply couldn't pass up. Contacted the seller and was confirmed that the car has clean title, paid off, under his name. ""Seller"" told me that he is selling due to the his ""weed business"" going down. (1st major red flag, I know) The next morning (May 6th), Sunday, I went with family to check out the car and everything looks fine, vehicle is absolutely pristine. I pulled a carfax and even checked the if the car has been reported stolen, everything looks clean, vehicle well serviced.

I paid full cash for the car below ""his"" condo near DTLA, he gave me an ID that matches with the name on the title: Mark. He signed it off and I took off with the ""new car"". Since DMV is currently closed due to the virus, I will have to submit the completed title to online title transferring service which doesn't open for work during the weekend. However as I looked back at all the details on the documents that night, it seems like everything's forged.

First, The ""seller"" we met was a slender white male around 5ft8, but ID states that he is 6ft tall at 200lbs. Furthermore, the title states that on the issue date(august 2019) the car had only 92 miles, but on carfax it shows that by that date it should have gone well over 15000 miles. What surprises me even more is that the ""seller"" even managed to forge the hidden California bear watermarkings that can be viewed under light on the title.

So today (May 11th, Monday), to further confirm my suspicions, I drove the car to my local dealership in the morning and found out that the name of the previous owner is ""George"", not ""Mark"". Right after that I went to my local police station and filed my report, and as expected, the vehicle was reported stolen yesterday on Sunday. 

Just an hour ago the local police came and simply did a ""stolen car recovery"", and the car was towed from my driveway. The local officer told me to contact LAPD's investigation department tomorrow and file my case with them, and told me that the car will be returned to the owner and it's very likely that whatever amount I payed will not be coming back.

I strongly suspect that the seller that we met and the actual owner of the vehicle are in the scam together, and I will certainly continue my case with LAPD tomorrow and this post will get updated.

He had been in the apartment for several months at this point. However, three days after I moved in, he left the house before I woke up and never came back. He took his phone, his backpack, maybe two other personal items. He left everything else he owns here, including all his clothes, his bed, his books, his toiletries, and his house key (doesn't own a car). 

He ignored my calls and texts - I was worried he had gotten hurt hiking, as he goes hiking most mornings. I filed a missing persons report pretty quicky because I was worried about him. The police told me that they had been in contact with him, and that he had just said he was safe and well.  Then this weekend my gas got shut off. I called all the utilities to find out he set a disconnect order as of a few days ago. 

I am just so confused. I don't know if he is coming back. The landlord recommend I start looking for a new roommate, but what if he comes back? What do I do with his stuff? I don't have room to keep it here if I get a new roommate, and I don't want to pay for storage for it. We have paid rent through the end of the month, but I can't afford the rent for this place on my own. I don't know what to do, or the legal reprecuasions if I get rid of his things and get a new roommate. Could he come back and try to claim his room?

TLDR: my roommate of three days ghosted me. Does he have legal right to the apt if I cannot get ahold of him by the end of the month?

Daycare is technically open.,1589246074,"I live in a state in the the US that is under a stay-at-home order. My children’s daycare is technically still open, as daycare workers are considered essential workers. It is my understanding that essential workers need daycare, thus daycare workers are essential.

My employer is a company with less than 500 employees. They have not informed us of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act in any way. When I asked about it, they said that since I can work flexible hours from home, I do not qualify for paid leave to take care of my children. While they say I can work flexible hours, I still need to interact with other employees who work during the day. My children are awake anywhere from 5 to 7 am, may or may not take a nap in the afternoon and go to bed between 8 and 9. I could work at night, but then would literately not have time to sleep.

I am finding it increasingly difficult to work and care for my children at the same time. My partner has exhausted of their paid time off watching the children and now has to work full time, albeit from home.

My property management emails me at 5 pm today saying they will be touring my apartment tomorrow at 12 pm. Firstly, they need to give me a 24 hour notice. Secondly, this would ruin all my isolation I’ve been doing (which has been very painful emotionally and mentally as I live alone and have minimal people to communicate with and can’t see my girlfriend which is heartbreaking enough) as they could possibly bring in COVID. I’d have to wait another 2 weeks to be sure I do not have it, which I can’t do as my sister needs me for her newborn and I cannot handle it mentally. I’m already almost at my breaking point lol.

Despite having the letter, housing info, and info about the animal (vaccines, age, etc), they **would not allow the ESA on campus** unless I provided them with the following information, stating that it would assist them in ""eligibility determination.""

After asking if the resident has a disability legally defined by the FHA, they ask:

""Please identify the **resident’s impairment**(s) and **describe how each impairment substantially limits his/her ability to perform a major life activity** as compared to most people in the general population.""

""Please identify **if the resident is using any measure (e.g., prescriptions, treatment, therapy**, etc.) that mitigates the limitations caused by his/her impairment and, if so, if the mitigating measure(s) eliminates the substantial limitations. ""

""Please explain **how the accommodation is necessary for the resident** to use and enjoy University housing as compared to a person without a disability.""

""Please identify **any other accommodation** that may be **equally effective** in allowing the resident to use and enjoy University housing.""

I feel extremely uncomfortable giving them my detailed medical information.  Also they claim they cannot share it with other areas of campus, they could continue to have this information on file.  I was applying for professional school at the same university and did not want campus or the very competitive professional school having any access to this information.

I know that you are not allowed to ask people with service animals what disability they have.  Is is legal to ask this type of information of a tenant for an ESA, or to not allow an ESA without it?  Does the same apply to university housing?

11,Landlady hinting she will sue me for leaving my own window open,1589245132,"Context (an on mobile)

I moved into this place in late February. Its just me, my service animal and my cat. I rent out the room in the back of the house. When I arrived she gave me the lease to sign. No real rules aside from no overnight guest, an if I leave before the lease is up I still have to pay as if I never left. Both are fine with me. The room was listed as furnished with full kitchen access.

Well I most stay in my room with my animals. People give me really bad anxiety hence why I have the emotional support animal.

Well over the last two months she's started making a lot of new rules. No longer allowed to use the kitchen (had to buy my own fridge an microwave, get a lot of flack when I go to wash my dishes), no longer allowed to park in the driveway, not allowed to come an go when I please, (I'm a 25yr adult) an other small petty stuff. Well I accepted them just so I didn't have to butt heads.

Well we live in California an its been getting freakin hot. Like I sweat in my room with no clothing an two fan. There's no a/c so I leave my windows open. The windows are in the back of the house behind a very large wall. I work 9hrs a day, 6 days a week so I leave them open for my animals with the fans so they don't cook while I'm away.

Well the other day she told me I have to close the windows when I leave. I told her my concerns for my pets an she seemed very dismissive of it. I stood my ground on it because my pets can't just take their fur off or tell her they are overheating. I told her I'd comprise an close the windows a bit so they aren't wide open, but not close them fully, as I want the breeze to still come into the room an keep them comfortable.

That was two days ago, today I woke up to an email saying she was contacting her lawyer about me refusing to close my windows like she demanded. An that if I don't I would be held responsible for the full house if we got robbed (we don't live in a bad neighborhood) so I emailed her back. I told her that I fully refuse to place my service animal an his companion in any discomfort an that if anything happened to them because she wouldn't let me keep them cool it would be her responsibility. Needless to say I was pissed about but I made sure my email didn't come across as it. I mentioned how my lease didn't have the rule when I moved, an that my room is locked when I leave, as well as the tempture an how there is no a/c. If there was then of course I'd keep the windows closed. (Emails copy n pasted below)

Her reply was what comes across as a threat with lawyer. Lease that's how I read it.

I'm not sure what to do. Any advice?


-----------
Emails:

(Her @730am)
I just left a message for my attorney regarding you leaving any window opened when you leave my house.

Until he replies, I am requesting that you lock and use the metal locks I supplied you to secure the closet window every time you leave.  For today, if you must, leave the bedroom window opened... no more than 5 inches and you must use the metal lock I supplied to keep it opened only 5 inches.

Until my lawyer replies, you need to reply to this email and put in writing that you accept full responsibility if my house gets robbed because you left a window opened against my wishes


(Me @noon when I woke up)
Yes, I'm leaving the window open in my room for the comfort of my service animal an his sister. If your lawyer wants me to forward the email about his registration I will. 


I'm compromising today because it's cool out however, depending on the day an the tempture then I'll have to fully refuse.


If I'm going to be held for responsibilities of the house then if anything happens to my service animal an his sister then I'd have to hold you responsible for that.


Also there wasn't anything about it in the lease agreement. It's not illegal for me to leave the windows open in the room I pay 900$ for. I followed the other things that weren't in the agreement but I am declining any changes that put my service animal in discomfort.


If needed, I'll happily talk to you lawyer friend about it because placing new requirements that aren't on the lease after its been sign it's something that can't really be done.

(Her)
You didn't close the closet window as requested.  Anyone can come through the closet window because the metal lock can be accessed by taking the screen off.  As soon as I speak with my attorney, I will be able to decide whatever options I have and I will proceed as advised by my attorney.

14,I think my neighbor created a disabled parking spot themselves with a sign bought online and a can of blue spray paint. Is there anything I can do about this?,1589244851,"I live in Pittsburgh, PA in the city where parking is fairly limited. My apartment/townhouse is on a small one-way side street that's a bit hidden, so it's pretty nice. We don't live in a complex at all and different landlords own different buildings on the street, so our neighbor does not have the same as ours. When my girlfriend and I first moved into the apartment we noticed the neighbor had a handicap sign pinned to a lampost and we respected it accordingly, convinced it was legitimate because, who would think otherwise?

Over our time living here we have noticed the neighbor is fervently defensive of his spot. That being, to the point of if anyone parks maybe a foot or two too close to the lampost the neighbor or his wife will bang on the offender's door and demand they move their car immediately. My girlfriend and I, after once parking too close too the spot were very understanding and complied. That being said, it appears the ""spot"" no one else on the street is allowed to park is getting larger and larger every few months, with others living on the street being yelled at more for parking in relative closeness to the lampost that was fine months ago. Please note that in all of these cases, there is still plenty of space for the neighbors to park their car relative to the lampost.

I know this definitely sound like I'm punching down here, but we've been threatened with having the police called on us before and I'd rather not take any chances. I do not want to skew any possible advice, but I feel I should also note these neighbors live in squalor. Bags of beer cans are left around their front door and on the street by them, and every other night we can hear them screaming and yelling drunkenly at one another. So, to be honest, this has warped my perception to the point I question if the disabled sign is legitimate. Also note, I'm not questioning if the neighbor himself is disabled... Nothing obvious that I can tell, but I know disability comes in many forms.

What brought me to actually post this though was, after another drunken fight overheard from the neighbors last night (nothing distinguishable), I came home from work today to find a very large, spray-painted blue handicapped curb similar to what you would find through the city. That being said... With COVID going on right now, and with the behavior of my neighbors up until this point, I have my doubts on the legitimacy of this spot. I counted the length of the spot, and it came to 16 feet long.

Is there some way I can find out if this spot is legitimate, or if my neighbor literally just painted it themselves? I have no desire to confront them myself. This massive spot that's been painted is going to cause me to have to park at the very end of the street if I come home late at all due to the wasted 4-8 feet that's been painted that their car will never fill.

I know it’s not legal everywhere, though I can’t really see why since it’s essentially just like conceiving a child out of wedlock or a woman using a sperm donor. I guess the only difference is the pre-arrangement and whether it is “enforceable.” 

But let’s say I have complete trust in the mother doing what we agree on, would this be a viable legal procedure, in Illinois:

A) mother does not put me on or any father on the original birth certificate;

B) I then adopt *my own* child *from* the birth mother, thereby terminating her rights while becoming the legal adoptive parent (of a child I secretly know is also biologically mine);

C) it could be an open or semi-open adoption so child may know her/his bio mother, and someday (when they’re much older, maybe after my own parents are dead) I might reveal that I am not just adoptive father but biological father too.

For a variety of reasons, related to religion, I’m a single man who’d like a biological child, but would prefer my family and community believe that the child is merely adopted (and I would prefer to not get involved in three-party baby-making and IVF, hence preferring traditional surrogacy).",legaladvice,False,thehmogataccount,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi0iqg/traditional_surrogacy/

21,A chain of unfortunate events after a break up,1589244297,"I only made a Reddit account to look for help. A friend had suggested this for me a while ago for my own personal situation, but this is much more important to me and I want to get a better understanding.

This is my brothers situation. I'm just being as supportive as a sister can be. If I'm missing information, it's because I'm not there every second. I will try to be as detailed and as accurate as I can be. Since we don't even have a case for this, I will be replacing names as I go.

Please help. My brother is being accused of domestic violence. Here's the entire story.

My brother and his girlfriend (who I'll be calling Angela), recently broke up. They have a kid together who barely turned a year old. Since they broke up, they've been going through the process of splitting 50/50 time with the baby without going through a legal process because they believed they could work it out within themselves. 

Well the first night my brother had the chance to put the baby to sleep and tuck her in, Angela asked to have the baby. Calmly, he told her that it was his night to put the baby to bed. She laughed and went to go shower, so he took the time to change her diaper and help her fall asleep. When she came back, she asked to see the baby and he said that she was already falling asleep and asked her to wait. She went to a seperate room and after a couple minutes, police showed up at his door. He answered and they asked who he was and what the situation is. He explained who he was and that he was just putting his baby to sleep. They asked if he had the door locked and he said no. They asked why he wouldn't let Angela see the baby and he said that she was welcome to, but it was his night to put her to sleep, as the two agreed on. The police officers informed him that he couldn't be making these calls and he said that he didn't, that Angela must have called. So they asked for her and talked to her outside. They told him to have a good night.

Two or so (?) days pass, my brother went to work in the morning as usual. He works with my mom and she knows the situation clearly, so she told him to go home to be with his baby. Surly enough, as he was coming home, she was leaving with the baby. He asked what was happening and she said she was leaving with the baby and her stuff, which wasn't much considering my brother and my mom both bought most of the stuff (and she said it wasn't fair, but she cant do anything about it.) He let her go, knowing that it would only affect her. With running away to her moms house and the constant police calls (a max of three within the last few days, I'm not sure), my brother has been keeping his patience in hoped to see his baby girl, the sweetest baby I've ever met.

Well, her lawyer called. She tried to make an arrangement for him to see the baby in Angela's moms house under supervision. She wants them to arrange a schedule that only benefits her and gives her more time with the baby. When my brother asked why he couldn't spend a day or night with the baby, the lawyer explained that Angela was scared and felt unsafe because he's been violent towards her. That she kept a diary of the times he's gotten up in her face and grabbed her arm and sent her to a hospital. There is nothing in her record that says anything about having been in a hospital and my brother was taught to never lay his hands on a woman, especially since our mom was a victim of domestic violence. And with me being his youngest sister, he has never shown any aggression towards me. My brother is the most patient man, so seeing him get irritated now is a surprise to me, but very understandable. He just wants to see his baby, but Angela is constantly calling the police on him (max five calls now, all of them informing both that they cant do anything and he was in the right and shes only making things worse for her) and accusing him of domestic abuse with no proof and mixed stories. Since there's no chance of setting a court date due to the quarentine, they're just discussing and waiting to see what happens. All he wants is 50/50. 

I apologize if this is jumbled, I'm typing this as I discuss with my brother and my parents and english was not my first language.",legaladvice,False,justalostsister,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi0gfb/a_chain_of_unfortunate_events_after_a_break_up/
22,Can I still use my parent's health insurance if I get secretly married?,1589244256,"I (23F) met my boyfriend (23M) in August of 2019 we were just friends until December when we started going out. We are very much in love and we want to be together for the foreseeable future. However, I am an American citizen and he is not. Corona has kind of fucked over his original plan for staying in the country and now our best option is to get married. We have talked about it a lot and both of us are down for it. He's even told his parents and they are supportive. My family is a different story. They're religious fundamentalists. They don't even know I have a boyfriend and they would freak out and potentially disown me if they found out I wasn't a virgin. We've decided to keep our marriage a secret from everyone except his parents and two close friends. My entire family lives on the other side of the country and I definitely believe I can keep it from them. The problem is that I am still partially dependant on my parents for a few things like my health insurance, which I will no longer be covered by if I get married. I work two part time jobs so I don't have the ability to get my own insurance through my employer. I could buy my own but coming up with an elaborate lie to explain away why I'm not using their insurance anymore would be very complicated and I don't know if I could get away with it.

My boyfriend and I live in California where anyone can get a confidential marriage license. If we get this, is it possible for me to just stay on my parent's insurance without raising any red flags from either the insurance company or my parents? Obviously, we will have to file separate tax returns and such.  This wouldn't go on for years or anything, just until one of us gets a job with benefits. But is this possible to get away with?

We dated for about 1.5 years starting freshman year, and he was extremely manipulative and psychologically abusive towards me. Not sure if that's relevant. But he dumped me back in January, and due to the manipulation, we maintained contact (meaning, he continued to treat me like garbage while manipulating me into being his emotional support animal). About 1.5 months ago, I finally got the strength to cut him off (for good), and he has been harassing me since then. Texts, calls, voicemails, Instagram DMs, Facebook messages, Snapchats, and even emails after I blocked him on other platforms. Today he sent my brother a package (they became friends during the relationship and my ex has been using my younger brother to contact me) which contained a few small things for my brother, but was VERY obviously just an excuse to send me a book I like and a LONG letter included. I feel so sick and it's taking a toll on me that he will not stop with the harassment online and through mail and through my family members. I have now talked to all of my family members about the true nature of the relationship (they knew nothing and had assumed that we split amicably), but my ex is scary and persistent. Is there anything I can do? The contents of his messages have varied between calling me insane, being angry at me for cutting him off, begging me to respond, and the letter was a confession that he is still in love with me. There are no threats in the messages, so is there anything I can do legally? Do colleges generally have a system that could help?? anything is welcome, I am confused and I just want this horrible person out of my life.

I live in Guadalupe County, Texas while my step father lives in Boulder County, Colorado I was adopted by my step dad in 2009 and put under his health insurance. I got married and joined the army in 2014 which would've removed me off his insurance at that time, that did not happen.  I have since moved on to get medically separated, divorced from my ex husband at the time and married my current husband who I have 2 kids with.

 I was informed by my stepfather 2 years ago when I got remarried that he would be removing me from his health insurance (blue cross). I have been using VA care for the last 4 years so this has not been a problem until now since I switch to tricare prime. Blue cross is considered my primary insurance, due to this my husband couldn't get his meds because they couldn't find the tricare policy under the blue cross one. 

I am unsure why he won't remove me now,  I have asked him to do so multiple times and  he is full of excuses and claiming he can't get me off his insurance. I have called blue cross directly and been told that because I'm a dependent I am unable to remove myself from the policy or update the information of my marriage. His policy states I will be covered until I turn 26 or get married which ever comes first. He has failed to update his insurance company as they still have my maiden name listed. 

 What are my options legally to remove myself from his plan? Is he potentially benefiting from me being dependent in his plan? My husband is dependent on the medication  Thank you in advance.",legaladvice,False,KaikoEnzo,/r/legaladvice/comments/gi0dsz/what_can_i_tx_do_legally_to_be_removed_from_my/
28,Art and Jewelry On Consignment. Store Owner Avoiding Me and Won't Return the Artworks,1589243994,"Title says it all. Last year I consigned a considerable amount of antique art and jewelry to a store. I have done this many times with other stores with no problems. I had this store owner sign an invoice stating that he was taking this work on consignment and when it sells I am to be paid my share. So far he has paid me about half of one large piece. The balance on that is still due. Since December he has been ignoring my calls and texts. I looked up his old shop and found through the reviews to find that he had defrauded a slew of elderly people of their antiques, never paying them anything. Yes. Wish I had seen those earlier.

Today, I called him and left a voice message stating that ""my patience had run short. I said that he could either return my property or that I would be filing a police report, be reporting him to the State Attorney General as well as pursuing my money and my work through any legal means available to me.""  Magic. He texted me within the hour promising to meet me a week from now.

In order to create a legal record for possible pursuit in court am now replying to him by text. I am being specific about the time and date we are to meet and saying that should he be unable to meet at that stated time then he must have someone else come to the shop to complete the art handoff and come up with a payment plan for the balance of any money owed.

My question: Should I in writing iterate the threat of legal action should he not show up or not return the artwork and jewelry, or would any threat of legal action be considered coercion?

I know that any actual cash he owes me will have to be pursued through the courts should he not pay, but the consigned works are still legally my property. I am in California.

So he ordered new iPads for himself and my mom through the website of a large retailer. Apparently they are overwhelmed with online orders and, even though he had a confirmation email saying they would be sent to their house, they were mistakenly sent to an old address of mine (that he had previously shipped a gift to which is why it was saved in his account). The people living in my old apartment moved in right after I'd moved out, and I had actually met one of the tenants when he was touring the place and signing a lease. He contacted me and said that he'd received a package for me containing two iPads (this was NOT on the outside of the package so he had to have opened them) and what he wanted me to do with them. I learned from my dad what had happened and my dad requested return labels that the current tenant could attach to send back the merchandise. I would have happily picked them up and done it myself but I now live over 1500 miles away. I forwarded the labels to the tenant and then he ghosted me. We never got confirmation that the iPads were shipped, and it's not like it was that inconvenient, seeing as I used to live there and knew the UPS store was a 5-minute walk away.

How long does it take for a dog to be considered abandoned by the owner, and give me the right to take legal ownership of the dog I have been raising?",1589242279,"I have been taking care of my sisters puppy for about 3 months now. She comes and picks him up for maybe a day or two at a time every now and then but I typically have him 7 days a week, with the rare exception to when she does decides that she wants to see him. My sister is on meth, borderline hoarder, she is very dysfunctional. It is a literal pig sty and the puppy has asthma from her smoking meth and cigarettes in her appartment all day. I started taking this puppy when I went over to her house to pick up my nephew and my nephew reeked of dog piss and cigarettes. (If I could take my nephew from her I would do that as well) The entire house reeked of an ashtray that was filled with rotten dishes, meth, dog piss and shit. Neither my sister or her crack head friends that isolate themselves in her bedroom could even be bothered to take this poor dog outside to go potty as he was literally peeing and pooping at the front door to go out but no one would let him out to do so because that is clearly too much work and they would probably melt if they saw the sunlight at this point. That truley broke my heart. But even more so for my nephew. (That is a whole other story in itself that I am not going to be addressing here.) Since then, as I have said, I have had this dog for pretty much 3 months now with the rare day or two long visits to my sisters. I dont want to let her take him at all because of the way I know that she lives and how he is treated there, but she demands that he is her dog and that if I dont let her that she will call the cops on my for stealing her dog so I feel like I have to but I also feel like at this point she should have no right to take him anymore since he is pretty much my dog and has been for a while now.I have trained this dog, I have loved this dog, I have fucking raised this dog and gave him a home where he is loved and cared for and he hardly has asthma issues anymore due to getting away from her,  and yet I still dont get to call him my own because of the fact that he is technically hers. But that is why I need to know how long it takes for a dog to be considered abandoned because I am tired of having to just hand him over when she suddenly decides she wants him to entertain her for the night because she is now using him against me despite all I have done and the fact that I have raised this dog. He is only 6 months old and I have had him since feburary. He acts so timid and scared and I suspect that he has been abused because of the way he will submissively start urinating and become so afraid if he feels like he is in trouble or even sometimes when I try to feed him he will get very scared. I am really sorry if this is kind of a mess I am super emotional right now because she took him from me just now and said I will never see him again because I told her to clean up her car that my grandparents just gave her brand new and it is already trashed and that trashing it is disrespectful. I feel like at this point she shouldnt have the right to take him from me anymore since she has practically abandoned him and I have been the one who has had him and taken care of him. This is my first post so forgive me if this is horrible written I am just so shaken up right now and just want my dog back and to know he is safe.....

45,Are we responsible for fixing the storm doors on our house?,1589241930,"So, first off, we are renting from my MIL and FIL. Believe me, we don't want to be, and were looking into buying property and a house before COVID hit the fan. 

My husband and I have lived in this house for almost 4 years. The front storm door has been broken since I moved in about six months after he did. It never shut fully and a storm two years ago slammed it against the frame, shattering the glass. We don't use the front door often because it's a pain to open and shut and there is still some shards of glass poking up from the frame.  The back storm door started deteriorating about a year ago. As we speak, the frame is bent because the door handle fell off a month or so ago, and the catch gets stuck and we have to slam our full body weight against the door while jiggling the handle to get it to open. Aside from it being a fire hazard, it's a PITA since we either have to listen to it squeaking/slamming in the wind 24/7 or deal with 15 minutes of wiggling/hitting it to open it. 

MIL says we are responsible for it and refuses to take the balance out of the rent. While we technically can accord to replace one door one month and the next door the next, I think this is ridiculous.

46,Elderly Care for bedridden parent,1589241870,"**Location:** NJ, USA

**Questions:** Is my elderly father able to refuse to go to a nursing home even if he requires round-the-clock care?  If he does, do my mother and I have any recourse.

**Objective Situation:** I am staying with my parents in their home (owned). My father is unable to leave a hospital bed he has there, and needs 24-7 care for changing/cleaning/feeding/etc. He is able to speak and respond to questions. I work from home currently and assist in his care. My mother cannot manage this alone physically due to his size and weight without my help. This has been the situation for around 2 weeks.

He had a rehab doctor come in, but since he left has  refused to perform any of the exercises or even sit up on the edge of the bed. He states his goal is to be able to leave the bed, but he is not willing to take any action. With his physical state before this, there is definitely no chance he will ever walk. He provides no reason for his refusal besides that he doesn't want to. I will be unable to continue assisting with care and am holding off of moving currently during this time, but my job will not continue to allow me to assist.

**Subjective situation:** We don't want him to go to an elder care facility, and he won't want to go. But if he is refusing to take any action, my mother and I cannot continue to care for him for what could be years. We cannot afford 24/7 care for him, and medicare's part-time assistance is nowhere near enough. It takes 2 of us to change him or his bedding, or even just to put a pillow under his side. His size makes it a challenge even then.

But I feel trapped. If we say ""You need to exercise or we'll need to look at facilities you will move to when we can't continue this level of care"" and he responds with ""I'm not going"", I don't know what we can do. I know I'm not legally obligated to stay here and care for him, but my mother lives her and doesn't get that option. And neither of us can just walk away.

Thank you in advance for any advice on what our options are. And please know that we have tried discussing every other possible alternative in every conceivable way with him. He refuses to attempt physical rehab in-home for no reason other than ""I don't want to"".

47,me and my friend made an unfair bet (on both sides),1589241750,"Just an FYI this is not a “profesional” casino type bet. Me and my friend we’re just messing around when fishing.

So a couple days ago my friend was lining my fishing rod and somehow birds nested it (which is really hard to do and messes up the line) so i told him he owes me new line (The line was roughly $20)

Today he decided instead to make a bet with me. Our bet was that if he gave me the line he said he had - which was a very good line, but cased in a different line box, making me think that this line was going to be shit HOWEVER he wanted me to put in here that I did feel the line, but I’ve been fishing for 2 weeks so I really couldn’t identify the fact that the fishing line didn’t match the box it was in - and if it was bad line he would go buy me any line i wanted, if it was good line i would pay him $5. 

I took the deal and started fishing with it. I kept complaining about how shit it was to win my deal, little did I know it was actually really good line. Anyways my friend who wanted me to win got caught on my line and sneakily tied knots to make everyone believe it was bad line (line doesn’t knot up unless it’s bad). My friend then exposes the fact that it’s really good line and that it’s the best line you can have.

51,Predatory Landlord in Los Angeles,1589241253,"**Preface:** A year ago, my landlord's dad died and his brother muscled his way into ownership of the building. Last year he hired this young guy to ""help him translate Spanish"" and has consequently managed to run about half of the residents out of the building, since he can charge double or triple the rent now due to the housing crisis in LA. I'm gone a lot, but I've been told he has shouting matches with people and even issued an eviction notice to one of my neighbors during the COVID crisis when evictions are supposed to be on hold. The assistant once told me he goes to Pasadena court to see how evictions are done.

**My case:** In my case, I'm out of town 4-8 months of each year for work.  When I'm gone I have people stay at my place b/c it makes me feel safer and they can water my plants. I notified my landlord that someone was going to be watching my place, like I always do. The day I left and my friend moved in, the assistant knocked on the door and asked if she was my girlfriend or sister.  He then started following her and her boyfriend around, at one point saying he believes that she is subletting in violation of my lease. She said she wasn't but called me to tell me he was harassing her.  I called the landlord, who went on asking if I wanted other people having sex in my bed and some other stuff, and ultimately said I was violating my lease because I can only have guests for 10 days every 6 months.  Apparently it's in the lease and I hadn't noticed it. I had *told* him my friend was coming, so clearly this was some kind of a trap. I mentioned that I had told him she was coming  and he had said that was fine on the phone, and his assistant jumped in to say ""it's not in writing so it doesn't matter."" My friend has left and my plants are now dead, but I'm still concerned.

Does asking if my friend who was watching my place was my girlfriend constitute a violation of privacy? They have cameras everywhere and watch them obsessively all the time. He says it applies to all overnight visitors and that my apartment is for singles not couples. I have a fwb that comes over pretty regularly-- you can't have a relationship if you're limited to 10 days of overnight visits every 6 months. Does that mean I can't date when I get back? 

Meanwhile: 

\* The landlord's assistant raised my rent and several of my neighbors more than the rent controlled cap of 3-4% last year.  Probably the whole building. He changed it when I confronted him, but are their consequences for this?

\* It always takes at least 6 months to fix anything. When my stove broke he wouldn't fix it for 6 months, then he said he would replace the unit but he wanted me to pay for half of it. He finally fixed it.

\* The previous occupant to my apartment died, and I was never notified. I think I'm supposed to be told that. I wouldn't be surprised if there was lead paint or asbestos too.

\* The cameras everywhere make us all feel hounded.  Can we have them removed? If not, when I get back can I install my own cameras and microphones in the hallway? I'm certain he's broken laws when interacting with my migrant neighbors, they get harassed and threatened all the time.",legaladvice,False,JR-Darewood,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghzkxj/predatory_landlord_in_los_angeles/

Hello legal community, I’m posting this question on behalf of a friend who does not have a Reddit account. I recommended this forum to them and they asked me to post.

“I work for a state university in the US, with decent benefits.  I actually chose the job for its stability, and because I’m unmarried, with little in the way of family, and have always worried I would die young like one of my parents.  So I purposefully sought a job with good benefits, sick leave, etc--everything I would need to passably defend myself.  (If I could do things over, moving to Canada years ago would probably have been even smarter).  Anyway: two months ago, our HR person went on maternity leave for her 2nd or 3rd child (unsure).  Then COVID happened . . . and last week, the group-HR email sent out a call to ask for donations of annual leave or sick leave for the Head of HR--who is already in a position to see everyone’s annual leave and sick leave balances, etc.  Here’s the thing--I LIKE the head of HR.  She’s really nice.  I’ve never seen her do anyone wrong.  My knee-jerk reaction is to donate her a few days of my sick leave.  However, I also feel like 1) it’s just a few days, what if she judges me, not knowing my anxiety-filled situation?  That if I get sick, it’s just me to defend myself? . . . but also 2) this feels really innappropriate for her to do.

The legal question is- is it legal for the head of HR, who can see (and potentially judge) leave balances, to ask for leave donations from her employees? It seems that they should use a different protocol, since there is the potential for the person in that position to abuse the knowledge of employee balances and thus judge employees for donating/not donating.

I own a coaching program dedicated to helping people set up and build websites using Shopify.

A couple of months ago one of the moderators for my private Facebook group included with the program sent me the link to a ""custom Shopify theme"" he claimed that ""he designed"" to offer as a free bonus to my 500 or so members.

I sadly made the stupid mistake of not doing my due diligence and posted a link to the theme file on my ""free extras"" page not knowing it was a pirated $180 premium Shopify theme.

Earlier today I received an angry email from the real creator of the Shopify theme demanding we pay him for 500+ licenses of he heme for each student who has purchased our program equaling $150,000.

The reality is less than 10 people have even clicked the download link which I can prove and I wrote a formal reply to the creator starting what happened, how it was a genuine misunderstanding, and that I would be happy to compensate him for the 10 downloads. (I can't afford anything more).

For some context, we never hosted the file on our own website. It was uploaded to a Mega account owned by the person who first shared I with me. I never outwardly promoted this file download to any of my members in emails or etc and didn't use it in any sales materials for my program.

Am I at risk of being sued or criminal charges for unknowingly linking to a file containing copyrighted content? This is really upsetting for me not just for the obvious reasons, but because it was genuinely an honest mistake on my part.

This actually happened years ago, back in my sophomore year of high school. (I'm in college now)

I discovered a loophole in a website that the school uses for math assignments. I'm not going to say what exactly the website is, but the math problems are randomly generated, so no, you can't find answer keys on the internet or anything.

However, the loophole I discovered allowed people to view the correct answer to the problem they were currently working on.

When I discovered this, instead of being sneaky telling my friends about it or abusing it for myself, I first showed it to my teacher. The teacher then took me to the school's IT department, who asked me to repeat what I did. The IT department made notes of it, then told me not to abuse it.

I've come to find out that the school district reported that security hole that I discovered to the company in charge of the said math service, and got paid **a ton of money** for it.

I tried to Google this to no avail. Here is the situation, my brother and his soon-to-be-ex-wife filed for divorce in April 2019. My brother is playing very dirty with everything from stalling to trying little tricks to drag this out as long as possible. He is the sort of person who is more happy being right than happy. He does not like to lose and will make the other person suffer mightily if he does, unfortunately. He cannot seem to move forward in his life and has tried to recruit family members in a yearlong smear campaign against his wife. 

Personally, I am very sorry to see this because they'd been together since 2002, married since 2007. There are no children involved, thank God. I really have never had issues with his wife to be honest. I think she did the best she could with what she had as my brother is not the easiest person to live with or try to get along with. 

My brother has made mention of making myself and my mother as potential character witnesses. He does not share with either of us where he is exactly in this divorce process and makes a lot of delusional remarks regarding it. I don't know enough about divorce law in FL to say one way or another. But can family be called as Character Witnesses? 

And furthermore, I don't want any part of this at all. This is not my fight, I have no dog in this fight and it has nothing  to do with me. My brother seems to harbor the illusion that his smear campaign will work and whatever I would say on the stand would support that. He would be wrong, very wrong in fact. I'm not a sleazy person who is going to be on trial and make up a bunch of shit to make him look good and paint the wife as the bad guy. Not happening. 

So, CAN family be called as character witnesses? And if yes, what if they don't support the person who might be calling them as a witness? What is my recourse in this if it comes to pass? What can I expect?

I’ll keep this short, because there are obviously a lot of factors and things in the lease and the agreement(s) but I think this boils down to a pretty simple question.

We are under a 1-year lease with our landlord, ending May 31. After some discussion about this impending date, our landlord gave us 3 options at the end of April: sign another year lease, sign a 6-month lease, or sign a month-to-month (for up to 3 months) lease. We opted for the month-to-month. 

On May 1 we signed the month-to-month lease with a start date of June 1. He sent us a pretty standard (albeit makeshift) lease, which we signed digitally (not through any site or anything) and sent back to him. The language in the last paragraph of the (very short) agreement says “Renew lease term to commence on June 1, 2020 and end on ______”. We left that line blank because this is a month-to-month for up to 3 months. If we had a very specific end date we wouldn’t be doing the month-to-month lease.

Anyways, that was 10 days ago. Today he sent us an email giving us a 30-day notice (move out June 11) because he says we did not fill out the end date and he never signed it on his end, so it’s not valid. He apparently has already accepted a deposit from another tenant and done paperwork for this house.

Is this legitimate? Is there anything we can do? I can’t believe that we signed a document and we are just screwed over because he never signed his end or told us we needed to enter that date.

However, the absence of any such outreach is disconcerting given that I have direct knowledge of the alleged crime and can be tied to it via email, etc.

1.  The defendant has not been arraigned yet. Are fact witnesses in white collar cases usually deposed before or after the defendant has been charged?

71,"I was supposed to go to Miami for internship, paid housing for $1175 (1 month rent, 2 mos. security deposit) with 7 other people, got denied a visa, supposedly roommates don't want to refund me the money. What can I do?",1589240205,"Hi everyone! The title basically explains my dilemma but I can give more specifics if that will help you understand my situation. 

I'm a college student from Philippines who applied for an internship in a hotel in Miami, Florida last May 2019. We were assisted by an international agency that is affiliated with our university &amp; the people who got accepted from my uni asked me if I wanted to share housing with them as it'd be cheaper and convenient for everyone. The apartment has only 3 bedrooms and 2 full baths and I know 8 people is quite a lot but it's normal for exchange students to squeeze in a small apartment to save money.

Basically 5 of them had a starting date set for September and the rest is for October. Although we didn't have the same starting date, I agreed as I was told that I don't have to worry about the first month's rent. 

Fast forward, those five were granted a visa and bound to leave in 2 weeks. I was surprised because they are asking us to make a down payment urgently even though they said that we didn't have to. They explained that the down payment for the housing is quite high and they needed our share so they can get the apartment and also so they can guarantee that we still have the slot for the housing. 

I paid the down payment to avoid any conflicts and in hope that in a couple of weeks I will be getting my visa too. Unfortunately, I wasn't granted a J-1 visa and 2 more people from our group. It was devastating as I know I'm qualified but I had to accept it &amp; move on in our life. 

Now it has been 8 months and they still haven't refunded the money. We were expecting them to give at least the 2 months security deposit. I asked one of them yesterday if when can we get the money and apparently since their internship got terminated they had to go home and so they had to terminate the contract for the housing too.

Apparently the owner said they had to pay 2 months worth of rent, but instead of paying they used the security deposits. So now they are saying that since they couldn't get the security deposit back, they couldn't give us any refund. 

Can anyone give me an advice on how should I handle this since technically we weren't even listed in the contract as tenants, and second I feel like it's their responsibility to pay off the termination fees since they are the one who used the apartment and we just helped them to get it in the first place. Do I have any legal rights? Or if not how can I negotiate with them?

72,Therapist didn’t tell me my insurance didn’t cover Call Therapy Sessions — hit me with a huge bill a year later and expecting me to pay it.,1589239891,"I’ve been seeing the same therapist for a couple of years. However, in 2018, I moved to New York (originally from Virginia) and decided to keep my sessions with her via phone call therapy. She never mentioned that these are not covered with insurance so instead of my typical $25 co-pay, my sessions were $110. 

My therapist handles all billing, and has never been consistent on when I would receive the bill.   So, after about 8 sessions between August of 2018 to May of 2019, I got a bill in the mail.

It got lost in my pile of mail and I didn’t open it until last March of 2020 when I moving out of my apartment. It was $800. I called and emailed my therapist to get this corrected and she said that insurance doesn’t cover phone call therapy sessions and that she’d be willing to work with me in doing a monthly payment.

I feel taken advantage of because she knew this all along and didn’t tell me. I just assumed that it was covered my insurance just like my last 100 sessions of therapy. Was it my responsibility to know that? Or is it malpractice to happily do my sessions over the the phone and not tell me that I’d have to pay this in full? I’m a student and don’t have deep pockets. I feel taken advantage of for her not telling me that, otherwise I would have not gone to therapy with her over the phone.  I am worried collections will come after me. Is this worth fighting for? 

It was also my fault for the bill getting lost (I left for the summer and came back and found the bill a year later when cleaning out my apartment). Because my therapist isn’t consistent in sending the bill out, I wasn’t sure when I’d receive it. Any advice would be helpful.

75,COVID question not addressed in sticky - Owner took PPP loan now calling workers back to work with less than 24-hour notice and can not afford to pay us when the 8 weeks is up.,1589239816,"I am sorry if this is not the right place to ask this question. 

My place of work was on the brink of closing down, we were about a month away from having to close down and the employees (less than 50) had to file for unemployment. Then the lockdowns went into effect. Before the virus, we were not getting paid on time often waiting 2-3 weeks for our check. The virus hit and we had to file for state unemployment and then the federal coronavirus unemployment kicked in. In the meantime, the owners applied for and received a PPP loan. We were informed that we had to return to work tomorrow, this morning. Naturally, the employees were surprised considering we never thought the business would ever open again. Now we find out that they have the loan and we all have to return to work; the loan is for eight weeks. Yet \*there is no plan in place for what happens after eight weeks when the loan run out\* the owners actually said in a conference call the went on to say: ""well after eight weeks, you will just have to go back on unemployment"" not caring that if we go back to work and then get laid off again we lose the extra benefits. The only reason the owners took this PPP loan is that the borrower can use 25% of it to pay for past bills. The only reason we are being called back to work is for the owner to ease up on the many many many bills that they have. Also, the building has not been cleaned we are going to be given saw dust masks and we'll use \*""social distancing so there will be no need for any other PPE but we encourage you to bring your own.""\*   

The owners are taking money knowing that in eight weeks their employees will have to refile for unemployment (and lose the federal payments). We are not ""essential workers"" we import things from China and re-sell it and we don't even have the equipment to keep us safe. I live in one of the top five states with the highest infections/deaths. 

To top it all off I'm a single parent with 3 children and my state cancelled school for the year and daycares are not permitted to open yet. If I refuse to go back to work not only will I get fired but I will also lose out on my benefits and any sort of paycheck. Yet, I am being expected to go back to a dirty building, with no PPE, under threat of losing my ability to take care of my family and actively putting them at risk. 

I have never once used the state for anything, I have had a job all of my life, I am not trying to get one over on anyone or the government but I feel like my right to make responsible decisions are being ripped away from me. Is there anything at all I can do to stop this madness? This is a total abuse of the system. Finally, I don't want to dox myself but I also found out this week that when I was working my insurance was being withheld but not being sent to the insurance company and now the doctors want their payment now that the insurance company rejected the claims. 

Do I have any legal recourse here?

78,Neighbors Harassing My Sister,1589239665,"Hey all,

Just a quick question to hopefully get some advice on how I can help my younger sister (28). My sister is a mild-mannered person who struggles with a chronic illness. Currently she's living in a subsidized apartment in a sketchy neighborhood. A young woman, who my sister has no prior relationship with, recently moved into the apartment next door. In the last few weeks this neighbor has taken to banging on my sister's walls and windows and standing in front of her large living room window and staring inside her house at her. She has a rotation of boyfriends she brings around who also participate in this weird behavior. Several times a week they follow her out of her house and shout profanities at her, or block her from getting in/out of her car with their own vehicle. This neighbor does not shy from confrontation.

My sister has called the police, spoken with the apartment manager, and *recorded videos of this neighbor's behavior* \- including pounding on windows and walls. So far the police and manager claim they can do nothing to stop this. When this neighbor deliberately parked her car in my sister's parking spot, the manager slapper her with a two week probation but all she has to do is...not park in the wrong parking spot again. This fails to address the real issue.

Is it normal for the police and property manager to throw their hands up over something like this? Is there any legal action we can take, or anything we can do to get someone to take the situation seriously? My sister feels unsafe, is losing sleep over it, and desperately wants to move. Given the chronic illness it's hard for her to work a full time schedule so moving is the last thing I want her to have to stress over. I'm in a different city, and I'm a college student with a young child so I have few resources to contribute, but is there anything I can do to help from a legal standpoint?

Any advice would be much appreciated!

95,Was given an iPad from work. I think I'm about to be fired. Do I have to give it back?,1589238853,"(In Cali by the way)

I know it sounds kind of dumb why I'm asking this question, but honestly there's a bunch of nuance to this. I work for a solar company and was told as a reward for having my first deal close I would receive an iPad with mobile data on it. I had asked him when I received it if this was mine. He kind of beat around the beat around the bush saying it was for work. But did tell me it was a reward for me getting that deal to close. 

Well I've been out of work since covid started and they recently reached out saying they want me to start working again. I had some disputes about me starting working again (due to not paying me for not meeting the quota before covid started) and told him that I want to have a guaranteed paycheck before working again. He said he wasn't too sure and that he'll talk to the boss and let me know in a few days. 

Well today he text me asking if he can meet up and get the iPad back. I'm pretty sure they just want the iPad back and then are going to fire me lol. I'm just wondering do I have to give it back to him or is it mine?

I do not want the dogs to get coronavirus though. I hope they go to a nice \[redacted\] family that appreciates them. End recording.

**Me:** Do you um hope that you get coronavirus?

**Him:** Definitely

**Me:** And you hope that all of us get coronavirus?

**Him:** I would like that very much–

**Me:** Except for the dogs?

**Him:** Definitely no dogs. They need to go to a nice \[redacted\] family

**Me:** So you want everyone in this house, but the dogs, to get coronavirus?

The contact information for questions or concerns listed in the letter is my primary insurance (implying they seem to be responsible for handling everything); the only contact Ive ever had with the secondary is to request a list of providers.

I was stunned as I know that’s a big “no” at work and could land you into shit like this.

They told me I’m suspended as of right now and they will pay me for the rest of the hours that I’m missing today. They (GM? Assistant? My manager?) will give me a call once they’ve gathered sufficient evidence/witnesses/statements.

I asked them if I could know specifically who or what comments I made that were so serious that they received “multiple” complaints about and they said as long as the investigation is under way, I can’t know. They’ll give me a call once everything is finalized or need my statement/more information. 

I told them I’m not working until Friday and if it’ll be over by then and they said they’re not sure. Anything can make it prolong it if it becomes more serious, more witnesses, etc.

24,Our landscaping project landed us a 25k violation of a state buffer rule,1589236557,"We are about 85% done with a huge landscaping project. By recommendation of the landscaping company we are working with, we had over 100ft of a ditch piped, graded, and sodded. We thought this was Ok because we have neighbors who piped their property, the land survey from when we moved in a couple of years ago labeled the feature a ditch, it was recommended by the company. 

Late last week a state DWR specialist came out to inspect our property to determine if the ditch was in fact a ditch or a stream subject to buffer laws. They’re involved because we needed a permit for a deck rebuild. Since the yard is already piped and graded, they inspected up and downstream of the pipe. They found a bend downstream that they deemed to be an “intermittent stream,” and this subject to buffer laws. So the rule now is no modifications within 30ft of the stream, which means we need to tear everything out that we just put in, possibly including a patio extension. Fortunately our 1970s built house that crosses the 30ft buffer line is grandfathered in. 

After doing a bunch of googling, I’m pretty sure we have an ephemeral stream and not an intermittent, since it only flows when it rains - which wouldn’t be subject to the buffer laws. But I’m no expert and we have no way of proving it  and contesting the violation unless we dig up the pipe. 

I also understand the Navigable Waters Act, is going into place 6/22/20, and changes what’s considered “waters of the US,” and could work in our favor since intermittent streams would no longer be protected under the clean water act.

I was confused but honestly just thought the number 18 thst he kept repeating was maybe a code to input into one of the cars computers. Then it happened. From somewhere in the back seat area began pulling out bag upon bag of drugs. Methamphetamine to be exact. I freaked out but I didn't know what to do. I kept yelling at him things like ""wtf"",  ""how could you do this"" &amp; "" get it out of here"". I ended up doing what most people would NOT do, I helped him. I followed him back to his hotel room where he dropped off the car. I took him back to my house where he put all 18 into separate bags. Then the phone calls started.

I tried cancelling my year long contract early due to this pandemic and my fear that attending a public gym will not be healthy or safe in the near future. The best the gym could offer was a freezing of my monthly bill. A representative from Gold's Gym in Rosslyn, VA let me know that a total of a $200 fee would incur on my billing if I were to cancel the contract that I have with including my husband's membership. I completely understand under normal circumstances, the fee would be valid due to the contract, but with today's situation would they still be able to legally bind people to these contract's cancellation fees? To offer some insight my membership has been active and contracted since January 2020 and will expire January 2021. I wouldn't be trying to prematurely exit the contract if it weren't for the pandemic and I think even with the coming restrictions being lifted, it still won't be safe to use shared equipment.

I was a roommate in a sublease and there was no contract. I payed the guy whose name was on the lease $1000 deposit and lived there for 3 months. Long story short,  I said I was going to live there 6 months but only did for 3 months because of the corona virus. He said that he would deduct money from my deposit for not giving him 4 weeks notice. I felt that was fair as I am a honest understandable person, even though we never agreed to that when I moved in.

Deposit: $634

As I was moving out he said he was going to charge me for cleaning, bathroom, carper stains, etc. I talked him out of it as none of it was my doing and I did clean it the best I could already. To my understanding it is not required either way as there was no contract.

4 weeks after I moved out I asked for my deposit, he said that he was cancelling his lease and was subject to fees/cleanings and that him, our roommate, and I will have to pay for these. He said it would be about $100. I told him this is not my responsibility and legally I do not have to pay it, in which he responded we agreed to illegal activity, blah blah blah.

I told him I would pay $100 and would like to receive my $534 now.  (I feel like I am being scammed but at this point I just want my money and be done with this)

But then I talked to the other roommate, and it is under his impression he will stay there for many months and is not aware of any cancelling of a lease or anything like that. So I feel like the guy is straight up lieing to me but perhaps just maybe he hasn't informed the other roommate.

Now I am simply weighing my options on whether I should take legal action and get my full $1000 back or just wait and receive my $534, or perhaps wait a week and ask if my roommate is leaving, and if he isn't then I know the guy was lying to me and try and get the other $400 back from his scam shenanigans.

Any thoughts on this?

39,I want to re-home my family's neglected cat,1589235359,"On my parent's property where I (f26) live in Idaho, there is a cat that has been living on the property since they moved in about 5-6 years ago. This cat has been severely neglected and I have been thinking about giving her a new home, but I know that if I did and my parents found out, I could be kicked out.

In 2015, they had a dog who I loved. She was never groomed so her fur matted so close to her skin, it rotted. She turned up with a cut under her leg and needed a vet, and I got into a huge fight with my parents that night about it. They didn't want to waste money on a vet, and left her in the garage to die. I threatened to call ASPCA, and they told me if I did, they would make me homeless.

When my parents moved in, there were about five cats already on the property left behind by the previous owner. They were given the names of all but one cat, a fluffy black and white one we will call Cookie. All of the other original cats have died. We didn't know Cookie's gender or age, and I was the one who named her (leaning towards female). She is a long fur cat who needed extra maintenance but has never gotten it. I've been thinking a long time about secretly re-homing her. At this point, her fur is so matted, it peels away from her sides and leaves scabs behind. Every year it grows back, and every year she ""molts"" like this again. At the moment she is dragging around two matted wings of fur still attached to her.

I'd always planned when I moved out to just take her with me or call ASPCA since my parents couldn't make me homeless if I am already out, but I am disabled and have really struggled to find a way to leave.

My question is more about the legality of re-homing this cat behind their backs, and about ownership of pets in Idaho. Cookie was possibly a neighbor's cat at one point, but she is fed at my parents house. She has never been inside. She has a corner of her ear missing like she might have once been part of a catch and release program, but is clearly not a feral. My mom once told me it would be okay if I took her when I moved, but has since changed her mind.

My question is, would this cat be considered property of my parents? Would I be within legal bounds to re-home her? Is there some other legal route I can take to give her a better life?

I don't have the resources to take care of her myself, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.",legaladvice,False,justsomeone626,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghxrk8/i_want_to_rehome_my_familys_neglected_cat/

Heya, this is my firat time posting so I hope this type of post is allowed, if not I'm sorry, please remove it. :)

So, on the 22 of May I am going to court as a witness. The defendant is my former drug dealer, and I am a minor. He sold me benzodiazepines, weed and opiates. While I did already use heroin at that point (clean since the 26th of October now :D), he was the one that introduced me to IV use. He bought me my first syringe at the age of 14.

Since I was already questioned at the police station and answered everything truthfully and extensively, I had my charges dropped (would have been for buying and possession) because it was only for personal use only. 

Now my question is, is there any way I could still get in trouble when I say these things in court? My one worry is that I could be given a charge for distribution/trafficking, because I gave him a bottle of codeine and they found text messages on his phone about me asking for benzos in return so I could sell them (never received them tho).

I'm also kind of afraid that someone may be sitting in the courtroom that may want to harm me for what i'm gonna say, because I am one of the main witnesses, or that the guy sends someone to hurt me or something.

that there is more people coming and going and staying at that apartment. Now again I cant fucking prove any of this because they are smart and malicious as fuck. So lets pretend for a second you dont think im a lunatic or an idiot.

Cable provider (AT&amp;T) gives a promo rate for the first 12 months. Service begins May 6, 2019. I call a few weeks back to terminate service for May 5, 2020, which is already paid through in advance, that is the end of the billing cycle for the bill that came in April.. Expecting a $0 final statement, I instead receive a bill for early termination fees with ""due to one month remaining on the contract.""

I call to see what's up and they say that the because I canceled before June 5 is why I got the early termination fee. I tell her May 6 2019 to May 5 2020 is 12 months, and May 6 to June 5 is 13 months. The rate was for 12 months, and therefore I hadn't cancelled early. (I even spent about 60 seconds going through the chain of ""May to June: month 1, June to July: month 2""..etc) As with every corporate CSR, they are absolutely neutered and all she can do is push it up the chain and say for me to expect a call back. I even had the CSR who took the initial call to terminate the service confirm it would be a zero balance. They said she didn't put any note in, but I have the time, date, CSR name, and confirmation number so they can check the recorded line.

The way it's written on the statement is ""Promo rate $XYZ for 12 months, expires May 6 2020"" - so therefore on May 6 2020 the rate is not good, May 5 2020 the rate is good. I have paid through May 5. I have paid for 12 months of service and upheld my end of the agreement. The only thing I can think of is their automated bill system is looking at it like end-of-day May 6 is when it expires, which so happens to be day 1 of the next billing cycle ending June 5 2020, and therefore it incorrectly is assigning the 13th month as part of the 12 month time period.

When they call back, if they are unable to see the logic here and insist that I pay the $32.81 I really don't see myself paying it. So what can they do?

Hello, I was a manager at a small family owned company. Right when the virus broke out we had a meeting at work to determine our course of action as far as shutting down. The work was not essential, we were a company providing air duct cleaning for homes so we were sending crews to multiple people's homes everyday. All of our field technicians voiced their concerns about having to do this work which led to a management meeting about our course of action.

 The owner was doing anything he possibly could to make these guys keep working and they made me draw up a form to collect signatures from our technicians asking them to sign to keep working or not sign and go on unemployment. I sent out a mass text to all of our technicians telling them they didn't have to sign the form and that they should all be putting their personal health over the health of a company that obviously didn't care about their well-being. This message got back to the owner and I was just informed that I will no longer be working there due to this. 

I understand the risk I took by sending the message, however I felt that our workers had the right to know what was being asked of them.

Questions:

Does this clause basically allow them to change my pay just as it states or is there still some sort of employee protection and they can't do this? Are they able to do this because I'm furloughed and are technically not under the same contract anymore?

Do I have to go back now as they say and with a 50-70% pay cut or do I have any rights? This new no base pay structure is just temporary until things ""go back to normal.""

To explain the living situation: one roommate has subleased her room (is living somewhere else for those months) and is not paying rent for May-July. The other roommate is paying rent but not currently staying at the apartment, but living at home. I got a cat and have informed my landlord of said cat and I am paying the monthly fee associated with having a pet as stipulated in our lease agreement. My roommates are trying to force me to get rid of the cat and/or pay to have the furniture removed from the shared common space. The reason for wanting the furniture and cat removed is because the roommate who subleased is saying she is allergic to cats. Most of the furniture in that space is hers and I was going to have it cleaned when I leave in August. They want me to pay and have it removed from the apartment now. I told them that they are more than happy to remove the furniture themselves but I would not have it removed nor would I pay for it either. The other roommates argument for me getting rid of the cat is that her mother is severely allergic. Her mother who has visited the apartment maybe a handful of times and doesn't stay longer than a few minutes. Can they do anything to me legally? My landlord is aware of the cat and it is stated in the lease that cats are ok and on our payment website there is proof of monthly pet fee. The roommate who subleased's mom has called me 6 times and has threatened to call the cops. Is there anything I can do to protect myself and the cat? I will also be getting documentation soon stating the cat is an ESA from my therapist. Can they force me to pay to have the furniture removed? Thank you!

68,"Spouse's Govt. Job Demanding PHI in Relation to ""High Risk"" Status for COVID-19",1589233388,"[Georgia, USA]

Hello, I hope this post finds you well. 

Summary of events:

My spouse works as a civilian employee with the Child and Youth Services for the United States Army on a federal military installation. This is relevant because their regular duties involve close contact with 10+ young children at any given time. 

My spouse has been identified, on a DoD letterhead memorandum, by a military healthcare provider as a ""high-risk"" employee given the current circumstance, and should be on admin leave status if possible. The employer had previously placed high-risk employees on leave, and then brought them back to work in a facility sequestered from the children to do other tasks. That is apparently not good enough anymore.

My spouse was just informed that he/she and the other high-risk employees will be returning to normal duties (with large groups of children) starting at the end of this week. If they believe they are high-risk, the following ultimatum has been given:

1. Return to normal duties;

2. Disclose PHI (despite the aforementioned memorandum already provided by a military doctor) and they'll move forward from there;

3. Face termination.

When my spouse expressed discomfort with this plan, he/she was told that ""this is the federal government, and regulations give us the ability to request your healthcare information."" This does not sit right.

Obviously, her/his health takes priority and they will not be returning to regular duties, but we do not wish to disclose PHI as the determination has already been made by a qualified, federally-employed doctor that my spouse should be classified as ""high-risk.""

My (24NB) dad opened me a retirement savings account when I got my first job (summer job at 18) and then he would take my money from my checking account, which he has access to, and deposit it there.  It's a Roth IRA, I'm in the USA, DC if it matters, my parents live in a different state.  He's very big on that he knows best on what to do with my money.

I want to cut my parents off now because of abuse and bigotry.  I'm trying to work on getting my financials away from him, but I don't know how I can stop him from accessing this account.  He opened it in my name.  It was originally an Education IRA he opened when I was a kid, there's a little bit of money left in the Education IRA, and then the Retirement IRA, which he has been putting my paychecks in.  He also sometimes puts money in there.

When I cut them off, I'm worried he is going to take all of the money from my IRA out or otherwise try to control it/hold it hostage.  I want to get it so he can't access it, but US tax law says that I can't withdraw it without getting tax penalties.  I tried googling what you are supposed to do in cases of financial abuse but I have no idea how to make sure he can't access the account.

I actually don't even have the password to the online account right now, but I am working on getting that.  I could then hopefully change the password/email/recovery email/phone number to all be in my name, but he is the one who opened the account.  So can he access it no matter what? Should I withdraw it and take the tax penalty?

I'm also worried that if I do deny him access, he'll accuse me of stealing it, even though it was a fund made for me and the money he put in was for my education/retirement.  If he makes a big deal, I can give him that money back, it's my retirement fund but if it gets me free of him, I don't care, but I do want the money that I put in from my account.

I attempted to search for the record on Rhode Island’s judiciary website, but nothing comes up with my information.

- Domestic disorderly 
- Domestic Simple Assault 
- Cyberstalking and harassment 
- Violation of protective order

79,How to remove someone from a mortgage? Asking help for my mother,1589232403,"Hello everybody,

My situation is this. I am trying to find some advice for my mom about removing my dad from our mortgage. The backstory behind this is that my family moved into this house about 11-12 years ago and my mother bought this house under both of her and my father's name. My father was very abusive and never paid anything (not even utilities or grocery) in the house, never a single house payment. About 4 years ago my mom kicked him out and he moved back to New York (we currently live in Georgia).

I begin college in Florida in September and we are trying to sell our house, but my mother wants absolutely no money to go to my father during a sale. I turn 18 in June and we've been applying and reapplying for child support in hopes that it will remove him from the mortgage. My mom is convinced that's the only way to get his name off and I'm hoping there are other routes we can take that will be just as effective. 

I do have proof of abuse and domestic violence, a certificate of paternity, and proof that he did not pay anything. We have had frequent visits from the sheriff looking for him due to outstanding lawsuits and warrants. I currently attend therapy to recover from the 14 years of living with him. It just really sucks knowing that we haven't seen him in 4 years and he is STILL stopping us from getting on with our life. I know this shouldn't be my problem, but my mom doesn't really prioritize our move as much as I do.

I apologize if this is vague, I'm just trying to get some advice on something I really know little about. Thank you in advance for the help, you have no idea how much it is appreciated.

80,Apartment manager living below me in building is controlling and aggressive. Constantly harassing my SO and I about ”excessive” noise.,1589232321,"My girlfriend and I are very much reasonable people and never make noise beyond what’s considered normal for an urban apartment building. We moved into the unit last year after it had apparently been vacant for some time. The apartment manager lives in the apartment below us, and evidently got used to not having upstairs neighbors. To clarify, she is not the owner, she manages the property and lives here. I haven’t been able to contact the owner. 

For the last several months she has complained to us several times about “excessive noise”. We don’t have guests, don’t blast music. She is talking about things like dropping a phone, wearing shoes in the house, etc. She has been texting me and running upstairs to pound on my door about this since we moved in. She posted very passive aggressive notices at all entrances to the building about “excessive noise coming from apartment XXX.” To be fair, the building  has wooden flooring and the walls are thin - we can hear our next door and upstairs neighbors as well. We’ve put down rugs and are always trying to avoid contact with the floor to avoid making her angry. I personally think she is being unreasonable and is making the living arrangement unpleasant. 

The apartment manager also had kids who live in the complex that throw parties way louder than anything we’ve ever done. We also live in an Asian community in the United States, and as we are 2 obvious Americans, I wonder if that’s got something to do with it as well. 

I eventually told her to stop harassing us through text and got no response. Today though we wanted to do a simple workout - just abs, squats etc on yoga mats and rugs and lo and behold apparently this is too noisy for her!

81,Arrest warrant issued for sentence served,1589232321,"5 years ago I was arrested in a county I no longer reside in, nor had I at the time of the arrest. Today I received a notice of warrant for my arrest, dated 05/05/2020.

I served my community service for what was ruled a misdemeanor, took a mandated course, and had reported to court 360 miles from my home on 4 separate occasions until the court determined my sentence was served. This was all completed as of summer 2016.

I am trying to track down the lawyer that handled my case for assistance, but am having some difficulty.

Should I call the county clerk to let them know I received notice if I cannot first consult with a lawyer?

Can they reopen my case when a judgement has already been made on the charges and I've completed all directives of the court?

I am positive this is a mistake, but I do not know how to move forward and I cannot afford to hire a new lawyer amidst this pandemic.

Through the last 2 months I've been searching for a car. I found one in New Jersey and thought that it seemed like a good purchase. They said that it needed some work but they priced it quite well and given the damage that they stated, I'd save a good amount of money by doing the work myself. I contacted them and we went through with the deal, I sent them a wire transfer of $2500 and $650 worth of electronics to make the deal happen. They later mailed me the Title. However this was around 3 weeks ago and I had a mechanic go down there a few days ago and he said that the damage is much worse than they originally disclosed and that it needs a lot of work and isn't worth buying. What would my best option be here? I never filled out the title, Never registered it, or did anything with it. Additionally I've never been in person to see the car and it's remained on their property the entire time.

I have copies of the bill of sale etc. I signed the bill of sale when I was 16 and am 17 now, so my understanding is that it's null/void and that I should be able to reverse the deal, is this correct? If I do, are they required to send back the money and the electronics also or just the money? How should I proceed from here? I never told them I was a minor but I never showed fake ID or anything.

Accidentally title jumped.,1589232189,"This is a long drawn out story that I’m beating myself up for. I really need help. I am a 19 year old college student. In December I bought a car from a girl. It was the shadiest thing ever but that is besides the point. When I went to register it the tax lady said it had to be notarized since it was from a notary state (Ohio) and I am in Georgia. I asked, “What if I cannot get into contact with her? She’s some girl from Facebook.” She said she doesn’t know. I tried to meet up with this girl several times but no reply until 2 months later. I had no choice but to still drive this car with insurance but no registration. When she finally met up with me it was February something. We notarized the title on February something. I’m an idiot and procrastinated registering it for I believe 2-3 weeks? I barely drive so I figured well I haven’t registered in two months, I’ll be fine. Then the pandemic happened. My tax county officed closed and said I can wait to register it until May something I believe. I sold my car May 9th not knowing that title jumping is a thing. I am ignorant and naive and thought he could just register his car just fine even though I never paid for registration. I was just excited to sell my car finally and get a better one. I told him all the issues I was aware of and gave him the title and bill of sale, sold as is. He called me flipping out saying he needs this car ASAP and can’t drive without applying for a tag and getting insurance. I don’t know why he can’t get insurance when I had insurance my entire time driving. I told him (not thinking really) that I can register the title and he can put “applied for tag” on his car. I know that’s not true after thinking a bit. I said this after finding out my tax office is taking appointments just for title transferring. Anyways. I’m going to hopefully drive two hours to him to get the title back and register it in my county because I cannot register it in his county, right? I have to register it in the county that’s on my license? Anyways, say I do go get it. Register it in my county. Is there any way to have the title mailed directly to him quickly? Or does it have to be mailed to my address? He’s freaking out, wanting his money back, that I no longer have. I had a panic attack because he called me during my lunch. I didn’t go back to work because I’m so freaked out over this. He paid $1,100 for the 2006 bug. He said he really needs a car he can drive NOW. I feel horrible for this.

Original agreement was every other weekend access and 2 weekday evenings/week, but he has not been doing this while emergency orders are in effect (but is fully aware that he can visit from a safe distance and is welcome to video chat and phone any time he'd like - which he does very seldomly.). That being said, he expects regular access to continue in the next week or so, claiming that he has access to the original schedule, regardless of the current climate.

92,Landlord wants to show unit. I work from home and nobody can see my screens.,1589231660," 

Hi all. Location is Ohio.

At the beginning of the month, I notified my landlord of my wish to vacate and end the lease on June 30th. As a result, per the lease, the landlord can start showing the unit to prospective tenants. According to the lease, they have to give a 24 hour notice to enter the premises, unless another agreement has been made.

Due to COVID I have been working from home, and will continue to do so until after I move out. I currently work in Healthcare IT, and my desktop computer has special permissions on it to allow it to Remote into my work computer. I cannot do work from any other location without that desktop. My workplace is completely locked down. I cannot get back into that building for any reason. All I have is my desktop.

Due to the nature of my work, patient information is often on my computer screens. I remote into computers that are onsite from users actively dealing with patients. 

As a result, it is a massive HIPAA violation for anyone besides me to see my screens. I live in a one bedroom unit with my husband, and he works from home in our living room while I have claimed the bedroom. 

The time frame my landlord wants to show the unit is between 9:00AM and 3:00PM Monday-Friday. He hasn’t specified any time he will show up with a tenant, just that he will be showing the unit. This is smack in the middle of my shift. 

I emailed my landlord asking him if he can give me a week notice, as my work requires at least 7 days in advance for any time off, or it counts against our unpaid days, of which we have 9 until we are fired. 

My landlord responded back with a picture of the signed lease stating he only has to give me 24 hours notice. I cannot work from another location. I cannot let him or a random person walk into my room and see my screens.

Is there any way I can fight this? I have asked my boss if I can have closer notice, however he is adamant of the “If I do it for you, I have to do it for everybody” rule, so he isn’t budging there. I will lose my job and get sued if they find out an unauthorized user can see patient information.

The next thing I am going to try is have my boss write a letter or an email and send it to my landlord but i have no idea whether or not that will work.

It was a 12 month contract that he got the first two months free for introducing new customers.

Now suddenly there's an $800 bill from them due to not paying despite his efforts to cancel and inability to get to a location.

99,[VA] Neighbors fence over property line! Division fence dispute.,1589230926,"Several months ago I discovered through the city property website that one of the boundary fences on my property is on my side of the property line by a significant amount (~10 feet at the far end and ~3 feet near the front of my property). I have since had this confirmed with a property survey. Both my property and my neighbors is fully enclosed.

The current fence is approximately ~10 maybe 11 years old based on google maps and Virginia adverse possession starts at 15 so that is not an immediate concern but definitely a reason to not delay as the land value would be around $9,000.

My plan is to demolish the existing fence and build a new fence on the actual property line. I would like to split the cost of the fence as it equally benefits both properties.

After a tense conversation with my neighbor they are claiming that they will not under any circumstance pay for the removal or building of a new fence. They are claiming that I must build the new division fence a couple feet on my side of the property line. Their claims are based on the following:

If I build a division fence they will claim that they wish for their land to lay open and therefore not split costs.

*My rebuttal: The property is currently enclosed and they currently have a dog which they let run in there yard. They would and have benefited from the property being enclosed. This is an attempt to not pay there portion of the division fence.

The fence was built by the previous owner of our property so they have no liability as to it being demolished.

*My rebuttal: From referencing google maps the division fence in question was built to fully enclose their yard. My house at that time was left open. Not only that but the ""good side"" of the fence is facing their yard. It seems obvious that the owner of their property constructed the fence.

My questions for Legaladvice:

1. If I do construct a boundary fence would they be liable to pay for 1/2 even if they claim that they would like there land lay open?

2. Would they be required to pay for demolition of the current fence? Reimbursement of survey cost?

3. What documentation do I need to prepare? Do I need to notify the city that I am constructing a division fence?

So, nothing too crazy, but my retail furniture company just informed me that we will be opening back up Friday the 17th. 

Till now, we had been working minimum hours required to have all of the work done(usual 12-16) and still receiving 40 hours pay. As of Friday, any hours under 40 will be docked from your vacation time.

When I asked, they informed me that this is because they are receiving money from the government to fund the payroll as if it were a 40 hour rate, and now that they are open I am required to work 40 so their payroll matches the paycheck protection funding.

This doesn't really smell right to me. It really sounds like double dipping if they receive 40 hours of pay from the government, 8 hours of vacation time, and I receive 40 hours pay.

(Background
I have 0 criminal record. I have 1 red light ticket in 16 years of driving. I served honorably for 8 years in the armed service including 1 combat tour and am service connected disabled from it. I’m a registered medicinal marijuana patient in a state that pioneered legalization for medicinal use and has a registry for medicinal users as well as foundations connecting disabled veterans to it.)

For 8 years I have been battling nonstop (unfounded) allegations from ex1 every 6 months. Resulting in a removal of the kids “under an abundance of caution”-an investigation clearing me of the allegations by cps- and then another court battle just to regain minimum time. 
This turned into ex2 conspiring with ex1 after separation  2 years ago and a complete team up and exchange of “classified documents” from ex1-ex2 each lobbying a new/different reason, while sighting the other ex’s filed complaints. 

Currently this means 3 different judges, 1 per case and 1 for the contempt charges for back child support. 5 mediators in the last 2 years alone.(mediators paid for by ex 1 and 2 had drastically different biases then court mediators). There have been a total of 17+ judges, 8+ mediators. and at least 7 CpS investigations all initiated by the ex’s to gain custody in a pattern.
 
I believe I’m currently being extorted by these 2 ex’s and state for my children. Even going as far as “offering a sweet deal” from dcss to sign my kids over fully including naming rights in exchange for no contempt for back child support. When I raised the issue with the opposing counsel, they removed themselves from the case and new lawyers were brought in to accuse me of new allegations to gain custody since I wouldn’t sign over my rights and fought the contempt case. 

Now as a last straw to gain custody they are going after my marijuana usage saying that because I vape CBD I can’t have anything other then supervised visitation at a fraction of the time I would normally have my kids. Both ex’s are refusing to allow any telephone communication even tho there’s no “no contact order”

6,My neighbor's trash is threatening my dog's life,1589230607,"So my neighbor and I share a large tree that sits on my property but it is close to the fence so branches hangout over both properties. These neighbors are no where near ideal, their house seems like it's falling apart, there's holes in their garage, they yell at each other and blare music at ridiculous hours of the night outside in their cars. I've dealt with all that shit, but I will not deal with this:

They leave their trash outside and more often than not with overflowing trash spilling out of it, lid is never closed. No matter where you live, animals will find the easiest access to food, trash is easy. Their trash is backed up to my fence that is in close proximity to the tree I mentioned before. 

If you hadn't put it together by now, squirrels and other animals have been getting into their trash then they'll go up into the tree or on the fence line to eat it's snack. Hanging out on a branch that is over my yard, dropping things that it deems inedible. Including *chicken bones*!!! 

Now most of the time, dogs eating bones is pretty normal but cooked chicken bones pose a certain threat because they're brittle and break into pieces pretty easily. This increases the risk of a sharp bone piece getting stuck in an airway, damaging the dog's esophagus or both. Both of which could severely jeopardize my dog's future as a happy boy, not to mention his life.

9,Brother defaming family online.,1589230412,"TA for obvious reasons. I live in Virginia, but the people involved live in Virginia, Washington D.C., and Maryland.

For years, no one in my family has been in contact with my older brother. He’s struggled with mental health issues his whole life and has always acted erratically, but this behavior has gotten increasingly worse over the past few months. His decline has been especially clear because he has fairly popular social media accounts with thousands of followers and regularly updates them.

Recently, he has been going on these long Twitter rants against my family, specifically targeting my parents. He’s made false allegations of serious neglect and abuse and told stories to bolster these claims. Needless to say, my parents are heartbroken. Yet, they refuse to bring any kind of civil suit or legal action against him because they don’t want to cause any more hurt and deepen the estrangement.

Absolutely none of his claims or the stories he’s told to support these allegations are true or remotely accurate. It would be incredibly easy for anyone, including myself, to provide concrete evidence that each claim and story is baseless. Even though I am not specifically named in any post, this has greatly harmed my emotional well-being, personal and professional relationships, and career opportunities. 

Could I bring a suit against him for libel/defamation keeping in mind that although I am not targeted, his posts have negatively impacted my life?

the MN dept of Rev is claiming my 2015 taxes were never received so they did a Commissioner Filed Return and claimed I owed \~2400 dollars to the state. They sent all the notification of this to a dead address I hadn't lived at for \~8 years. 

2 months ago I received a phone call out of the blue to my cell phone number from the Dept of Rev claiming they have been trying to garnish my wages for over a year but my job wouldn't respond so they finally found a number and tried to contact.

I verified who they were and walked through the call. At the time, I can only recall being told that: If I started to pay down what they claimed I owed, then filed my own return, I would get all the money I had paid in so far to the wrong debt back.

I then completed my paperwork for 2015 and found they state actually owed me 240 dollars.

I contacted them and told them I had a refund and asked when this was processed how I would receive back the miss billed amount.

25,Former employer using a surrogate company's job offer to kick me off of my unemployment benefits,1589229407,"TL;DR: A company owned by one of the owners of the restaurant I worked at before the pandemic offered me and my coworkers jobs in their kitchen a few days ago. When we said no they threatened to report our declining the jobs to the department of unemployment. Can they do this? Will it work to disqualify us from unemployment insurance?

&amp;#x200B;

I was working as a server at a small restaurant in Chicago, IL that closed indefinitely on March 15th, and I’ve been on unemployment for the past month or so. Over the last few days I received two voicemails out of the blue from a person I don't know (but who said she ""worked with \*the restaurant I worked for\* and \*company offering me job\*"") offering me a job working in a kitchen packing meals for their ""meals on wheels"" program. The second day I called her back and turned down the job, and on our phone call she actually did not explicitly threaten me. It was a very brief phone call, she simply responded with ""no problem, just thought I'd reach out in case you're looking for work."" That same day however, I heard from two other coworkers that they were also offered jobs by this company, and in phone calls and texts the same woman told them that ""\*restaurant I worked at\* will be notifying the department of unemployment that you were offered a job and declined."" The restaurant we worked at is still closed and has no plans to reopen. We are assuming that they knew we would decline the jobs, and were trying to bait us into doing so in order to get out of paying into our unemployment insurance.

First of all, I'm not sure if declining a job necessarily precludes me from qualifying for unemployment benefits right now. When first applying back in March, I remember reading that if you are laid of directly because of COVID-19, and are ready and able to go back to the same job that you had, you are considered to be actively seeking work and do not need to meet the usual requirements of verifying job-seeking. I don't know how declining a job fits into this new policy, more specifically declining a job that I did not actually apply for from a different company I haven't worked for.

Secondly, I know there are several reasons for which it's kosher to turn down a job. Here are several potential reasons that I know are/think should be valid, in this case:

1. Though I haven't specifically asked, it surely would pay substantially less than my previous serving job PER HOUR. In order for work to be ""suitable"" according to the department of unemployment, it must pay comparably. (Though since I was only working \~25 hours per week before, they may be able to claim full-time work is comparable pay. Again, however they did not explicitly promise full-time work.)
2. I live on the North side this job is on the South side, at least an hour commute on public transit, and I don't have a car. My previous restaurant job was a ten-minute walk from my apartment. I don't feel safe riding public transit right now.
3. I live on the North side this job is on the South side, at least an hour commute on public transit, and I don't have a car. My previous restaurant job was a ten-minute walk from my apartment.
4. I was serving and this is a food prep/cooking job. In order to be suitable work, it also has to be similar enough to your previous job. Even though I am qualified as a cook and worked in the kitchen briefly at the very beginning of my job at the restaurant, for the last 6 months or so I had been exclusively serving.
5. I am going to stay with my parents on the West Coast for a few some time this month. This was the reason I actually gave on the phone, since it seemed the most straightforward and immediately disqualifying. This one is also tricky though because I realized that I may not be able to leave the visit a different state while claiming benefits. 
6. It is not safe. A job is also not suitable if ""your safety, health, or morals may be endangered."" I don't feel safe going to ANY workplace right now, let alone THIS one because......
7. **We have heard allegations of confirmed Corona cases at the company offering us the jobs. My coworker spoke with a few other people who had management positions and/or stake in the restaurant, and they told us that the company was trying to cover up coronavirus cases in their kitchen while actively trying to hire people. We are reaching out to the county health office to obtain records of these cases.**
8. As far as we know, while they share an owner, the company offering us the jobs and the restaurant we worked for are not the same company. If our restaurant were reopening and telling us to come back to work, that would be different, this is a different company entirely.
9. WE DIDN'T EVEN APPLY TO THE JOB! They just called us all out of the blue! Does this even count as a valid job offer?
10. This is potentially intimidation/entrapment/extortion and we should maybe team up and turn it around and sue the fun out of them.

If anyone knows which of these would apply in general or now in light or the new corona policies, please please let me know which reason(s) would be best to focus on.

I have to certify for my benefits tomorrow, which requires answering the question: ""have you turned down an offer of employment over the past two weeks?"" I don't know how to answer that question, I've heard that if you say yes it automatically terminates your benefits and forces you to reapply. I don't want to lie but it doesn't seem like a fair question in this case. (Further, as Illinois is a two-party consent state, it would be illegal for them to record our phone call. Doesn't that make it my word against theirs if I say that I never declined the job/couldn't hear them at all over the phone and hung up...?)

Would really appreciate any knowledge/guidance. I am concerned with making sure I don't lose my unemployment benefits, but also with reporting them for any illegal/sketchy things they may be engaged in. For now I will wait to see if unemployment money keeps coming in but if it doesn't I don't know whether to just appeal to unemployment or seek legal representation.

35,I was assaulted and the charges were dropped. I will have to leave my hometown if there is no further protection I can receive. I have some legal dirt on my attacker which I want to expose.,1589228398,"TL;DR my attacker contacted me after being arrested and told not to contact me again and is not facing any punishment; the charges against him were dropped and I don't feel safe in my hometown since we go to all of the same events; my attacker is a drug dealer and I believe he was committing fraud and I want to report him.

Background info: when quarantine started I (21F) began to stay with my attacker, who was my friend at the time, because I had a really horrible roommate and mentally did not feel safe at home. My mother is a chemotherapy patient and therefore is immune compromised so staying with her did not feel like an option to me. My attacker turned out to be a very emotionally abusive person to live with and often had extreme outbursts of anger. I was unhappy but felt like I had nowhere else to go.

The assault (trigger warning): One night we were on his bed, talking, when he said something to me that made me uncomfortable. I told him calmly to stop but he continued to say it. I told him that I asked him to stop and he wasn't respecting my boundaries. He got extremely angry and told me I was going to die alone because I set too many boundaries. I started to cry and asked if we could talk about what he just said and he said he was done with the conversation, and that if I didn't leave his room he'd get his parents to pick him up and he'd go sleep at their place. I said fine, go, I'm not letting you shut me down and gaslight me. He then got extremely angry that that didn't work and got a spray gun and began to spray my eyes with water telling me to leave. I was frozen, sobbing. He then began to scream and dragged me by my hair halfway across the room, kicked me, dragged me by my hair again, and slammed the door into me to push me out of the room. I began packing my things to leave when he came out, twisted my arm until I screamed, and continued to spray me with water even though I was already leaving. I had to get my mom to pick me up, risked infecting her with covid, and I called the police and filed a report when I got to her house.

The aftermath: I blocked my attacker on all forms of social media. He texted me to apologise. He sent a link to a song to a secondary instagram account of mine which I forgot to block him on. He was in a snapchat group that I'm in and posted in it frequently which was very triggering for me to see (I could still see his messages to the group even though I had him blocked). A detective called me and said that he will go ahead with pressing charges, once my attacker is arrested he will not be allowed to communicate with me in any form or be in the same building/venue as me and any communication will result in further charges. I told the detective about the snapchat group and that I think he should have to remove himself from the group once he is arrested. My attacker was arrested and immediately after he sent me two text messages and a message on a platform called radiate which I forgot to block him on. He also continued to post in the snapchat group.

On Friday I received an email from my detective saying  ""The crown has elected no proceed with criminal charges on the condition that \[my attacker\] no longer communicate with you.  The explanation behind the decision is that \[my attacker\] has the right to remove you from his room. Furthermore, he has the right to use as much force as necessary to accomplish this (similar to police or security officers making an arrest.) Therefore, although everybody agrees that \[my attacker\] did use physical force on you the force did not exceed the threshold to lay criminal charges.  I understand this is difficult to understand but \[my attacker\] has been caution not to communicate with you and should he communicate with you he will be charge criminally with Harassment. This conditions is similar to a restraining order. "" 

My fear right now is that my attacker and I attend all of the same local music shows in my hometown and I will never be able to go to a nightclub and feel safe or have fun with him there. If there is nothing preventing him from being at the same location as me I will have to leave my hometown when covid is over. I am also frustrated because he did communicate with me after he was arrested and remains in the snapchat group; I think he should be charged with harassment. I also want to dispute the charges being dropped because I believe he used excessive force; pushing me out of the room would be one thing, but dragging me by my hair and kicking me, and continuing to inflict pain upon me after I left the room is excessive. I also was not a trespasser and was standing up for myself so to not be emotionally abused and gaslit. I don't know if the law offers any protection against that, and I'm wondering if I can ask for a female detective to look over the case as she might have more sympathy for me. I also wonder if the story he told the detective was fabricated. I have a text exchange with his ex girlfriend of her telling me that he lied to the police when she called the police on him for an incident while they were together.

The dirt: My attacker is a drug dealer and I want to report him, however I have purchased illicit substances from him in the past and I don't know if I'll get in trouble for that. He was also claiming zero income for unemployment insurance for around a year even though he was making money from selling drugs. I think this is fraud but I am unsure as the money he was making was made illegally. I also have his mother's email and want to email her to tell her what happened and expose all of my dirt on him but I don't know if it would backfire on me legally in any way. I am located in Ontario, Canada.

A gentleman (""Caller"") called and was asking for information about someone, he said it's his father and he hasn't seen or spoken to his father in over 20 years. Caller said that he's adopted. He gave me a first, middle, and last name which when I searched our database, we do have in our system. The person in our database is someone our company hasn't spoke with since 2017, but Caller was able to provide details that matched the resume I have on file for the father. For instance, he said his father was in the US Army in Georgia, which was listed on the resume for the person I found in my database.

I didn't tell him anything, just that I would need to do some research, but my question is can I give him any information at all to be able to contact his father? I have his fathers phone number, email address, and physical address (as of 2017), and though I'd love to help him out I also don't want to put my company in any legal trouble to do so.

I rent a 1 bedroom apartment with my husband on a yearly lease that renews automatically. Our lease anniversary date is March 1, and we need to give 3 full months to quit, which means November 30 is the deadline. I got pregnant in January and found out in February. Our baby is due early October, so there will be 3 of us here for 4 months.

A friend mentioned that she knew someone who with a doctor’s note was able to move early due to pregnancy, but the residential tenancies act only mentions quitting early for medical reasons due to reduced income or unusability (with the example being no wheelchair access). Pregnancy does not seem to apply, as my income will be reduced on maternity leave but we will still be able to afford this apartment, and we can all physically access the apartment just fine.

I also can’t find anywhere if having a kid means we HAVE to leave our 1 bedroom? I can’t find a maximum occupancy per bedroom for Nova Scotia, if we have one, and I’m not sure if that lets us out of the lease.

I would like to move into a 2 bedroom before the baby comes if that’s possible, but if not it’s fine. The property management company we currently rent with has 2 bed units available and we could probably have our lease transferred no problem, but they’re all really really expensive (like $500 more each month).

70,Filing for divorce in Indiana. One child together. Ex and I have been separated for years and have a great relationship. We have our own agreements on everything and have no disputes. Need some advice to make this process smooth and keep the state from trying to get unnecessariliy involved.,1589226516,"My ex and I are finally getting around to getting legally divorced. We were married for 3 years and have been separated for 7. We have a really good relationship and work together to help each other out and to raise our son. At this point getting the divorce is just paperwork to us. The romantic relationship ended long ago and there are no hard feelings or disputes on either side. We share custody of our son in a way that gets both of us equal time with him. Our houses are only a few blocks away from each other so it's very easy for him to spend half of the week with me and half of the week with her without any interruption in schedules. 

As I'm filling out the divorce paperwork I'm noticing that a lot of it seems to be written towards parents who want/need the courts to make judgements on child support, visitation, debts and assets, etc. We don't want that. We have done a great job working things out in a way that is best for us and our son over the years. The last thing we want is for the state to start putting their nose in where it doesn't belong and try to change the agreements that we have. I know that it's the state's job to attempt to do what is best for the child but we already put his well being above everything else and frankly, neither of us needs or wants the state butting into our lives. That has been a big part of the reason that we have taken so long to file for divorce. We both feel that getting legally married was a mistake as if we never had then we would be free to take care of our family without interference. 

Now that I have gotten the main information out of the way, here are some of the big questions I have:

**1) Legal custody and the primary custodial parent**. As I stated above our son spends equal time with both of us. The forms I'm filling out have an option for joint custody but it wants me to specify a ""Primary Custodial Parent"". We don't feel that either one of us should be the ""Primary"" as we both share custody. There is an option to write in an agreement outside of the ones in the forms. If I fill in that we should both be Primary Custodial Parents will the court accept that?

**2) Child Support.** Neither of us pays child support to the other on a weekly basis. We share expenses as needed for clothing, school supplies, and any other needs that our son has. If one of us ever needs help paying for any food or bills or anything we help each other out. This system works for us and our son is always well fed, clothed, and healthy. The forms that I'm filling out want me to specify who is paying child support to whom and how much is being paid. It also wants me to submit a Child Support Worksheet. There is no ""Other"" option on this part of the form for filling in a separate agreement. Neither of us wants the other to pay support weekly as our son has all of his needs fulfilled. If I leave this part of the form blank will it be accepted?  Would I be better off checking both boxes that the petitioner and respondent will both be responsible for all expenses?

**3) Assets, Debts, and Real Estate.** We sorted out our assets and debts long ago. The house I currently live in is still in both of our names but that was mainly a matter of convenience as I could not afford to refinance the mortgage at the time that we separated. I am currently in the process of moving out of this house and then putting it on the market. She only lived in this house with me for a short time and does not want any claim on it or the profits that I might make from selling it. In fact, once this house is sold I may be using thos profits to buy the house she currently owns from her. Do I need to attempt to explain all of this in the divorce paperwork? Am I ok to check the box that basically says ""the parties have no outstanding debts for which they are responsibile""?  This is another thing we have sorted out on our own with no disagreements and we don't want the state getting involved. However, we don't want to cause any trouble for ourselves.    (Actually as I was typing this and going through the forms I came across the actual Real Estate portion of the form. There are quite a few options here that potentially describe our situation. Would it be best to check all boxes that apply? It seems that the simplest answer is checking the box that states that I shall be responsibile for all payments, taxes, insurance on the property as that has been the agreement for years. Does the court really need to know that I intend to sell the property in the future?)

**4) Taxes.** The form wants to know who will be allowed to file taxes on the child as a dependent. There is an option that states each party will file claiming him as dependent on alternating years. Well we don't exactly do it that way. We kind of do it on a year by year basis and come to an agreement. If I check that box stating that we alternate and then I let her claim him 2 years in a row is the state going to cause us any problems? 

**5) Open Letter.** I was thinking of writing an open letter to the court more or less stating most of the things that I have put in this post. Essentially that we have bee separated for 7 years at this point and that we maintain a good relationship, always put the well being of our son first, and that we have our own agreements on everything and don't want any of them to change or be interfered with. My ex would of course sign off on this letter as well. My plan was to write that up and submit it with the divorce paperwork. Is that a good idea? Would it be at all beneficial? 

 

I understand that the majority of divorce cases are fraught with disagreements and our case is likely the exception. Still, it's very frustrating the way everything seems to be written for bitter custody battles and disputes over debts and assets. It's a pipe dream but it sure would be nice if there was a SIMPLE DIVORCE-EZ form option that basically states ""both parties are in agreement on all things and the child(ren) involved are well loved and taken care of so dissolve the marriage and leave us alone"". People can go around having kids with whomever they want and more or less be left alone unless things get bad enough to warrant interference, but god forbid you sign that paper making your relationship official and then decide that the relationship is not what you wanted. It sure makes marriage seem not worth the hassle at all. I know I certainly won't make that mistake again.

74,"Pool contractor has my $16000, will not give it back, yelled and lied to me and my local Bureau, what recourse do I have?",1589226277,"LOCATION IS PENNSYLVANIA

Hello! 

I'm having an issue with a contractor that I'm using for a pool installation. They're a local company but they're fairly large.

I originally gave them a $16000 deposit during March of 2019 and they said the pool would apply for a permit and begin construction in August. We have a contract. 

Nothing happened, so I contacted them about this in mid August and they claimed that they did not want to get the permit ""Too early"". 

Eventually they told me were held up by a current job and we would be first due in spring. 

Spring rolled around, Covid19 happens so no pool still. 

Then on May 1st, I called my local township and requested that they call him. I texted my contractor and let him know and he replied ""Okay sounds good"" 

Last week, I heard nothing so I called the pool store and spoke to the front office lady and she claimed the zoning officer told them that ""No permits will be issued for another two weeks"" 

I decided to call the zoning officer to confirm that he talked to our contractor and he told me that he hasn't heard from him since last year. In fact, he told me that they were doing permits now. 

So I called my contractor and asked him directly about contacting the zoning officer for the permit, and he told me that ""I talked to him and he told me it will be a few more weeks before they issue permits"" in which I told him that I contacted the zoning officer and he said that that wasn't true. 

I then merged the zoning officer on the call with the contractors permission in which my contractor started yelling and here's how the conversation went 

Contractor - ""I talked to you before right?"" 

Me - ""Hold on, within the last two weeks"" 

In which the contractor started yelling more over the phone and didn't let anyone else speak then hung up the phone. 

Clearly since the contractor was screaming and the zoning officer said that he wasn't contacted, it seems clear to me my contractor is lying to me. 

Do I contact a contract lawyer about this? I'm really just looking for my next steps to get my money back from these people because I've asked for it back now and they're refusing.

&amp;#x200B;

I am leasing a 2 room apartment, I have the money to break the lease and move on, My name is the only name on the lease.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend lives with me now for about 2-3 months, her name is not on my lease. I asked the apartment complex and they said that if I break the lease I don't need her approval because her name is not on the lease, and if I break it, we both have to be out within the 2 month period.

&amp;#x200B;

I pay a few bills for my girlfriend, she does not work, she is actually trying to get disability due to her medical problems. I'm at the point where I am considering breaking it or proposing and after thinking for a month about it I'm not actually happy with her and I want to break up as it is best.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for a clean break I don't care about how much I paid to help her live with me, she never gave me money, I only supported her for a few months now. She can keep the furniture and things if she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

Legally and financially if I decide to end my lease and I move to a new complex that is smaller so I can live alone, Will I owe her monetary support or anything? I did ad her as an authorized user to my one credit card and I plan to remove that card.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was working out at first and we moved together, but it isn't. I feel bad, I do love her, but I'm just not happy with her like I thought I was. I no longer do anything I like and no longer have my own hobbies, I conformed to her lifestyle and I realize how that isn't good. I feel it is better to end it now before marrying trying to make something of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to make sure that in Las Vegas Nevada that if she gets angry she can't demand I owe her money for support or housing or anything because I would not be able to afford two apartments, minimum rent in this city is 1100 a month, to hold 2 apartments at that rate is not sustainable.

She wasn't working when we met, and I'm totally okay with a future wife who doesn't work, but her not working I don't want that to be an issue if I want to break up.

77,Excessive fees for towed car off private property,1589226118,"Our car was towed off of private property in San Pablo, CA (Contra Costa County) by a private tow company to their yard in adjacent Richmond, CA.  Accepting that it was legally towed I have two concerns:

First and (one would think) most simply, how can I determine what if any the maximum allowed towing charge is (either a rate or absolute cap)?  Their $215/hr tow (plus gate and stoarage fees) seems exorbitant.  Thus far we've reached out to the relevant police and DA offices but neither could provide and guidance.  Currently the county clerk is unreachable during Covid shelter-in-place.

Second, despite the actual tow being less than 2 miles / 5 minutes, we were charged for 1.5 hours of their ""Basic Tow"" rate.  Even if we allow for both directions, hook up and drop off time, and interactions with the property manager and police, the Authorization Vehicle Removal form details a maximum of a 50 minute span.  The receipt, however, has an ""end tow time"" 46 minutes after the last time noted anywhere else.  When the agent handling the release was pressed on this, he contended it was time spent doing ""paperwork"" and that ""was allowed"" but no hard copy itemization past the Autherization was / could be provided.  Is that actually allowed? It seems unreasonable that they have carte blanche to take unlimited time doing mystery, arbitrary, unavailable, presumably-internal paperwork at the already excessive tow rate.

They’re keeping my $700 and asking for $360 more on top of that to replace the carpets and repaint the walls.

The carpets didn’t have any stains, smells, scratches or other damage, so am I correct in thinking the apartments’ choice to replace them was for normal wear and tear, and that I can’t be charged for that?

On April 20th all employees received an email from the Co Founder and CEO stating that they were reopening the office on April 20th. Many of us employees were shocked by this given the fact that a head of a different department died from the Coronavirus and an employee contracted the virus while being the only person in the office (understandable that this employee may have gotten it from somewhere else). There was also the matter that many employees commute from many places that had many confirmed cases of the virus(Bergen County NJ, Lakewood NJ, Brooklyn NY). Many of us sent emails to HR requesting to continue to work from home and those requests were granted. Yesterday, May 10th, I sent another email requesting to continue to work from home as the stay at home order made by Governor Phil Murphy was extended for another 30 days. The email that I received from the head of HR said,

""our business is not subject in any way to the stay at home order of the Governor. However, we chose to accommodate our office employees for a short while to work from home where possible. For the last 7 weeks, we have made every effort to accommodate working from home, based on the employee's specific role, and their department specific needs. We did this as well so that we can be properly prepared for all employees to come back into the office with safety in mind.

84,Acceleration Clauses &amp; Statute of Limitations (Maryland),1589225770,"Afternoon All,

I am being sued on a Private Student Loan I defaulted on in 2013. The complaint was filed in 2020, and the statute of limitations is 3 years. I have filed a notice of indent to defend with the claim that the debt is time bared in accordance with MD Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings, § 5-101.

Important to note that the 'specialty' SOL in MD is 12 years.

I have case law prepared to defend that the loan is not a specialty (the promissory note was not signed under seal)

In preliminary discussions with the debt collectors Attorney today, he stated the SOL runs in accordance with the acceleration notice that was issued in 2019.In the casework, there is a document from a debt collector that states the note is being accelerated, but I did not receive this (unsure if this matters, just pointing out that I learned of it through the receipt of the complaint).

I am having a difficult time finding anything related to acceleration notices and student loans, so I am turning to the community.

Given I cannot find anything on a time limit to ""accelerate"" a loan, would this not create a situation of a never ending statute of limitations game, since the debtor could theoretically accelerate forever?

I appreciate the input.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: the last date of payment was 8/2013, their acceleration notice is dated 11/2019. would that make the acceleration notice invalid based on the below, since it would be an action to enforce payment on a debt done more than 6 years after the missed payment that began the default?

90,[NJ] Credit card tips while on PPP payroll,1589225549,"I work in an upscale restaurant that just recently opened its doors for curb-side pickup. We don't have a cash register and people rather pay with a credit card anyway, and they usually leave a very gracious tip on the credit card. Our employer stated that he will put the tip money on the side in his savings account until we finish the two and a half months of PPP because he believes we aren't allowed to get the tips at the moment since we are making our 2019 average per week (what we made in 2019 / 52). He insists that if he does pay us the tips, he would have to subtract our agreed weekly pay (so in other words nothing would change for us; we wouldn't get more money).

I know that this whole situation is new to everybody but I am just looking for some opinions.
How would we be able to collect those tips after PPP is over? Would it be a one time payment?

92,No one knows who our landlord is and no one helps us during emergencies,1589225485,"Hey guys, I’m in a bit of a strange situation and I was hoping someone could give me some advice. I live in Ontario, Canada. 

3 days ago we woke up to water pouring through our kitchen ceiling. We called the property manager, “John”, and he was able to get here with a plumber pretty much right away. They worked on it for a few hours and then left. 

After the plumber left and later into the evening we found our toilet wasn’t working and brown water was bubbling up out of the tub drain. We tried calling John and he didn’t answer. And so we tried calling Samantha, the landlord. 

Samantha is well known for being useless amongst the tenants and we don’t usually even bother trying to contact her. When she does respond, all she says is to call John (who never answers during the evening) or to email management. Which is what she did this time. We were desperate obviously as we had been without a working toilet for a few hours now, and the brown water was really, really gross. We asked if we could call a plumber, what the emergency line is, a million different things and she never answered. 

Well it turns out while no one answered us the vacant unit beside us had been pouring water all night long. Now it’s destroyed with water damage, and so is the commercial unit below us. John returned with a plumber but they still were not able to fix the issue. As of this morning I still have no working plumbing and neither does the unit above me. It’s been 3 days and all we have is the property managers used camping toilet. 

Here’s where things get tricky- John revealed to me yesterday that Samantha is actually not the landlord, her only job is to get people to rent units. That has not been communicated to any of the tenants, who were also shocked to find that out after living here for many years. In fact, John told us there is actually 10 people that are supposed to be running the show and Samantha is only one of them. That means we all don’t actually know who the landlord is, and we were never given the information to contact them. They have no means of aiding us during emergencies, and it turns out the people we try calling in desperation aren’t even the landlords. This violates our rights as tenants, no? Do we not have a right to know who our landlord is, and is it not there responsibility to help us during emergencies and provide those services?

One time the fire alarm started ringing at 11pm. We called 911 (the fire department isn’t automatically notified when the alarm rings- they said it should) and they came but they told us there was nothing they could do without the landlords permission and then left. It was then 2 am and we were still not able to get ahold of anyone for assistance, so one of the tenants figured out how to turn it off themselves. Now every time it rings someone goes and shuts it off. What would happen then if there was actually a fire but the alarm was shut off? And since the fire department isn’t notified, no one would know if we all ignored it like we usually do. 

Finding out the landlord isn’t actually the landlord was the cherry on top of this shit cake. 
The wooden stairs outside are completely falling apart, there are rats in the building that no one bothered to tell us about (we had the pleasure of learning that after finding a massive rat in our apartment), there are cut wires hanging off the side of the building, no one listened to our multiple requests for cameras to be put up when there was high levels of crime due to people dealing drugs out the building (a tenant had a gun put in her face checking the mail), tenants can turn the fire alarm off and the fire department is not notified, there is garbage all over the place constantly, and now the building is absolutely filled with water damage. It is only a time before we get mold. And on top of it now we don’t even know who the landlord is and who we were supposed to be contacting. 

I used the email address Samantha said to use during our plumbing emergency, and days have gone by without a response to that email. What if a pipe had burst or something? When anything happens we’re completely on our own, we just have to hope none of our belongings get destroyed while everyone ignores us. I have a lot of evidence of this occurring and so do the other tenants and we’re trying to compile it all. But this goes against our rights as tenants, right? 

TLDR: the person we thought was the landlord isn’t actually the landlord and we have no idea who is. No one helps us during emergencies and it feels purposely set up so that they can ignore us. Because they did that while we had a plumbing emergency two units in the building flooded, and we’ve been without running water for three days. There’s been a lot of issues, and the other tenants and I believe that our rights have been violated.",legaladvice,False,maddsnk,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghungu/no_one_knows_who_our_landlord_is_and_no_one_helps/

94,"Client refuses to pay because job is not completed, but refuses installation under the terms of our agreement.",1589225111,"We install our products in residential homes, and as a result of dealing with very difficult people in the past, have come up with rather lengthy terms we published on our website; our quotes and invoices have a link to them, and stipulate that payment constitutes acceptance. 

Because of many factors outside our control, we are not liable for any damages, as is the norm in our line of work. We have a client who we've installed a few items for, but is refusing installation of the last if we aren't liable for damages. We haven't done any damage with what we've already installed, and this stemmed from him having another company lined up who would do it for less. 

He hasn't paid the balance on the other items we've installed because he states the job isn't done, yet is refusing the install if we won't be liable for damages – and, as he's been threatening lawyers, etc., we clearly don't intend on giving his anything he could use against us.

We've stated we can install under our terms, and once the other items are paid for. What other recourse do we have? We deducted the cost of installation and invoiced him, but he's of course saying he isn't refusing installation and that we didn't finish the job – going in circles. Should we just hire a collections company to collect on the invoice? Does he have anything to stand on?

From my understanding, this basically says we are all individually liable for the full rent payment for the house ($4050/month). My portion of this for the smallest bedroom is $1250/month. From my research it seems this is a common thing in group living situations in DC, and landlord is not willing to write us separate leases.

19,Need Advice Concerning my Lawyer's Handling of My Case,1589223487,"Hello,

    To preface with some information: I'm in Florida, and this case will be at the Orange County Court House in Orlando. It's for social security disability, which was denied on paper twice, and a court date has been set for late June.

    I have high anxiety, stress, and then my numerous medical issues barr me from also being able to navigate the SSD papers properly, and file things on time, so I decided it was in my best interest to hire a disability lawyer. Due to my age I suspected I'd end up in court eventually regardless, which is indeed the case.

    My issue here is that, legally, if I need to fire this lawyer at some point (I'll get to why momentarily), will I be liable for the fees of the work they've done thus far? We have an arrangement that they get payed only if they win my case, hence why I ask if I need to replace them - what I would end up being liable for, if anything.

    The reasoning behind my apprehension with this law firm, is that they are INCREDIBLY condescending, treat me as if I am mentally defunct (my body is jacked and I have major depressive disorder and anxiety, but my brain works skmetimes), and often try to push record pulling on me since it ""saves money"". Today they wanted updates records and he wanted me to get it mailed to me by the office, then take my time to pay to ship them the records.

    This man has already told me I'm ""basically seeking welfare"", and made other inappropriate comments in the nature of my age, and repeats things to me up to 10 times each time. The condescension is honestly driving my anxiety UP. He has also lost records, failed to file them, and generally not done what he has been supposed to be.

    My final question: He wants forms filled out by every doctor I see indicating why I cannot work in any capacity. They asked me for that months ago in the early stages, to which my Rheumatologist for my Fibromyalgia filled the paperwork out. They then said I could only submit one form like that and only from one doctor.

21,Dying Grandmother May Have Been Persuaded To End Life,1589223360,"Hi reddit, 
I am in search of some legal advice. My grandmother has recently been diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer. The cancer has been very aggressive. Despite my grandmother being treated with radiation, her condition has worsened. My grandparents have been having a hospice nurse come and take care of my grandmother a couple times a week. I recently visited her and my mother expressed concern that my grandmother told her she planned to stop taking her prescribed medications and give her up her fight with the disease. Luckily for my grandmother she has not been in a lot of pain, she just feels very weak and is tired a lot of the time. A month ago, she was optimistic about trying to go on a road trip one last time. Suddenly when I visited her, she was saying goodbye to everyone because she plans to stop taking her medications. My grandmother is on a lot of medications for pain and can be easily persuaded. My mother informed me that a hospice nurse SUGGESTED if she wants to speed up the process she should stop taking medications.
Is this legal?  My grandmother would have never brought this up herself to the nurse or frankly even thought about ending her life before, the nurse seems to have suggested she do this to end her life. I feel like this is not only against the law, but is just disgusting. Health care professionals take an oath to do no harm? 
My grandmother lives in the state of Wisconsin. I live in Pennsylvania. What kind of attorney handles this type of situation? Which state can help me?

22,"CA Purchased moped, back fees owed 2x what it cost.",1589223360,"This was my first ever used purchase.

The owner was very nice stated moped had been sitting for about 9 years as planned non-operational. (49cc but classified as a motorcycle)

He had the title and the transaction went well.

Days later I check the DMV Vehicle Registration Fee Calculator and the cost is double what I paid for the damaged scooter.

In retrospect I would have checked beforehand I knew there was a tool like that but no one I know has ever had trouble purchasing a used vehicle in the past.

I asked the seller and he re-iterated that it was non-op and it was in the DMV system.

Seller already submitted a release of liability which included my DL and personal info.

I have not transferred the title into my name and therefore cannot register but withing time to do so.

My plan was to fix it up as a hobby and have it as non-op but this is a huge blow especially since fees at over 1,000 which I cant pay.

I won't be title jumping, I just want to pay a reasonable fee and have it as non-op.

&amp;#x200B;

Please serious replies, If I had known fees transfer with owners and that I could check online I would have never bought it.

What are my options, Id rather lose what I invested already that lose 3x the money on a broken-down item?

This past week, though, I texted him for yet another update, and he outright just told me that the watch was still in the same condition, that it wasn't his responsibility, and that I should take the watch back. I believe that it is unfair that he led me on for so long, only to tell me to go eat rocks in the end.

I'm in California, and sent in a request for an address change on the day before the cutoff for voter registration. Unbeknownst to me, my home address had also received a Vote by Mail (VBM) ballot, where my mom and step-dad live.

Basically, one of them filled out the form for me, signed it (forgery), and sent it in. Without telling me. 

I got a letter about what had happened in early June 2019, with request for an immediate response. I called my mom, immediately assuming it was her. She told me that she ""hadn't remembered doing it,"" but that she had probably sent it in.  She said that I could respond to the letter and blame it on her. So, I did just that.

Fast forward to May of 2020. I just received an email from a different person asking for information on the incident, indicating that my response is required. I was simply going to send them a copy of the letter I sent out in June, but got to thinking about it a little more. I believe that it could have been my step dad who sent out the VBM ballot, as he has always been extremely childish and would 100% use what he thinks is my ignorance to get another vote for the Republican Party. To make it worse, my mom would cover for him and take the fallout. 

I'm worried that if I send in my response saying that it was my moms fault, they will pursue legal action against her. Should I just say that it was someone in my family and I don't know who? Or just someone who got their hands on my ballot? Or will it be unlikely they do anything about it?

They are both on video, he has sent this video to people and its gotten back to my daughter. She is being mocked amd harrased.

The time of the video was about a year ago.

I told them both to stop speaking to the boy and his mom and to say absolutly nothing more to them, as it could probly hurt our case more. 

I also told my daughter and Spouse to save all messages, the boy admitted to sending video to one person, although his mother has said that the boy is denying everything.  

Child porn is no joke, I know the kid will get in trouble but I highly doubt it will be more than community service and probation seeing how both kids are minors and given the little bit of evidence we have.

We have slightly different assignments, but we're referred to as having the same position. I'm also going to guess he negotiated better than me and gets paid more, so not a great cost-saving choice.

I’m a college student and I ended up renting an apartment last year with a 12-month lease. My problem starts around mid-March(I don’t have the exact date right now but I can provide upon request) at this point I had already given my landlord 45 day notice that I would be leaving my apartment complex 1 month early. I actually signed a paper that basically said that I would not be renewing my lease and I verbally told her that I would leave early due to my family’s concern on coronavirus. We had to move out on a day that was most convenient for us and that day happened to be on a Saturday which is when the leasing office is closed so I couldn’t turn in my keys. This is where the problem really starts. I figured that when I got to my hometown that I would just mail in the keys and since I had given her verbal notice that I had left she would realize that I had already vacated the premises. What I have just now found out in the past week, however, is that the keys were never sent to her because there was no one there to receive them even tho I told her that I would have to mail them in. Also in the two months that I have been gone she has 1) charged me for the month of April 2) charged me for May. I now owe her $1200 for two months that I was not in the apartment. She also has given me a 5 day notice to “vacate the premises” and turn in the keys or I will be evicted. My questions are
1)Can she charge me for two months even though I had already left by March 
2) Would I have any case in court since she has threatened to take me to court

My issue with this whole process is that per my lease agreement after 10 days of nonpayment I would have been evicted on the 10th day of April. With this in mind could she even charge me for May considering that if I was evicted I wouldn’t have even had to pay for May?

46,Employer claimed I made more than I actually did.,1589221807,"


Last year I picked up a second job to pay off my student debt. I was working at a small sports bar and restaurant. As with many restaurants, management was terrible and overall the place was problematic for many reasons, but I needed the money. I have worked in the service industry before and I learned from being unemployed before to claim everything I make just in case. I also used a tip tracking app and my average earnings per week was $600.00 usd. Paychecks were given weekly and mine ranged from $20-$100. 

I worked there from June 9th of last year through December 12th. When I received my W-2 the numbers were way off from my final pay stub. Stating I made $7,000 more than what my final paystub listed. I kept most of my weekly stubs and even with the few I’m missing the numbers don’t add up. I reached out to management and was in so many words told that’s the numbers they claimed so that’s that. 

This has pushed me into a higher tax bracket with my combined income and it’s interfering with student aid, my taxes and now unemployment. 

I applied for unemployment 2 months ago and have just received word that I’m ineligible because of what the restaurant claimed. They reported I made roughly 13k in 2 months. 

On my best week, I never made more than 700 in tips. I have my tip app input records, 85% of my pay stubs including my final one. I have no idea where to get started or what I can do. Any advice on how to navigate this would be appreciated.

54,[Kansas] Neighbors child has put multiple scratches on my car with his bike.,1589221331,"My son plays with our neighbors child all the time. His friends bike is not in very good condition and there is no rubber protecting his handlebars. He also just learned to ride without training wheels this week. Thursday I noticed over 10 scratches on both sides of my car. I asked my son about it and he said his friend keeps crashing into it. I went and checked the camera footage and sure enough I can see his friend hitting the car multiple times lining up with each scratch. 

I spoke with the parents and they said to get an estimate. I was able to get one this morning and it's over $2,000 in damage. I again spoke with the parents and they weren't polite at all this time. They said they wanted to see all the footage, which I think is reasonable, so I sent it over to them. They also said that they have seen my son drop his bike before and obviously doesn't take care of his property so the scratches could be from him. I brought them over to my garage to show them my sons bike still has the rubber on the handle bars and couldn't have put such deep scratches in my car... not to mention the footage I have of their child doing it.

After I sent the emails they said they want me to let them get rubbing compounds and try to remove as much of the scratches as possible themselves. Then they want to cover the deep scratches with a $10 bottle of touchup paint. I do think that almost half of the scratches could be removed with wax but I do not want to let them do anything to my car.

I'm fine with going to buy some wax to try and polish out a majority of the scratches but I'm not ok with touch up paint as a repair. If they refuse to budge on the touch up paint am I going to have to look into small claims court? Just curious what I should do from this point forward.

I paid the ticket fine as well as the DRA fee because I was speeding over 20 mph and I recieved 6 points under the NYS points system. I believe this translates to 1 point in the CA point system.

My question is, if I complete a NY certified traffic school, will this transfer over to my CA license and remove that single point on my record?

I already paid the traffic ticket fees so I'm not asking for any legal advice regarding how to fight a ticket. I'm more concerned about how to potentially get that point off my driving record because it affects my insurance premium.

Does anyone have advice/experience about completing a driving course in this situation? Would taking a course from the NYSDMV-approved list actually help remove the point on my CA driving record?

64,Representation Against Utility Companies - Pennyslvania,1589221048,"Backstory:

Not sure how to add location information.  This happened in Pittsburgh, PA.  In the USA.

Late February, the water company was doing work on my street.  While I was at work, they happened to cut the gas line leading from the city main to the shut-off valve in the sidewalk. Per procedure, they called the gas company out to repair the cut, but the gas company was still unable to maintain pressure in the line.  They ultimately replaced the line from the city main to the shut-off valve, and called it a day.  It wasn't until I got home that evening and tried to cook dinner at 10pm that I realized the gas had even been shut off to my house; they didn't leave any notice on my door or call me or anything.  Procedure dictates the gas company has to then test the line from the meter to the shut-off valve, and at the time my meter was in my basement.  The next morning, a technician came out, and tested the lines, only to find leaks both in my house and in the service line leading from my meter to the shut-off valve.  The service line leak was so major it couldn't hold any pressure. This is a short service line, and I struggle to see how a leak that major wouldn't be noticed next to where I, my tenant, and my neighbors all park and walk by daily.  Vegetation also grew completely unhindered, and I never had any issues with my gas, heating, oven, or stove in the year and a half I lived there prior.  It is my belief that the shock was so severe from hitting the line that it reverberated down through the pipe and caused a break in the service line.

It was a Thursday morning in February, and although it wasn't too wintery and cold on that Thursday, the weekend had a cold snap coming.  I struggled to find a plumber available to help, but was able to find a company to start work on Friday and complete work on Monday, they were kind enough to provide me with heaters to last the cold snap.

Now,I understand my fault in not having exterior utility insurance, but I don't think I should have had to pay for the exterior damages.  I called the water company, and brought the issue up with them.  They created an insurance claim, and have been dragging their feet to give me a final decision.  They claimed, however, the gas company didn't properly mark the road and the locations of the gas line in the one-call.  So I also created a ticket with the gas company, who promptly denied responsibility.

All in all, this has been quite a costly experience for me, having to take time off work to stay home for the repairs, paying increased electric bills to use the heaters generously donated by the plumbing company, and having to order hot meals in (gas stove/oven) during a cold snap just to stay warm.  Forget the inconvenience of not being able to shower, of having to waste a whole weekend covered in sheets trying to stay warm (might seem a bit dramatic, but it was a terrible weekend).

&amp;#x200B;

Advice Needed:

At this point, I feel I should solely be holding the water company responsible, even if the gas company didn't properly mark the street, it was the water company who caused me these issues, and they could take up any issues with gas company on their own time/dime.  It seems the water company is trying to wait me out, by blaming Covid and hoping I forget maybe, even though they reply to my email requests for updates immediately.  It's at this point, I think I need to obtain proper legal representation, and have made it clear that will be my next step if they can't make a decision.  I have never really had to deal with anything like this before, and don't know what kind of lawyer I should be looking for here.  I guess I'm looking for some sort of affirmation that I'm approaching this correctly, and looking for advice on what kind of lawyer or legal representation I should be looking for.

I'm on a monthly payment plan for the wedding reception location- the total is about 4k and I've paid about 2k already (including down payment). 

I've been talking to the owner of the venue and she has been giving me a hard time. 

1- I can't cancel the wedding with the venue because they'll just take the money I've already paid. 

2- If they have to cancel the event, then they wont refund me. Instead, they will give me credit to my account. And when I asked to reschedule during the summer of next year, I was told that it would be $2k more (for about $6k total.) And it isn't viable to do weddings in other seasons because I'm in Minnesota and the weather is not ideal unless it is in the summer. 

I was on the phone with the owner of the venue today and she literally hanged up the phone on me while I was pushing her to give me reasons as to why I can't reschedule for the same amount or just give me my money back.

I was planning on ending my tenancy at this residence in May 2020 as I was moving. Due to COVID-19, I packed some of my stuff and moved back in with my parents in a different province in March, not knowing I wouldn't be able to go back to NS to move my stuff out. I paid a friend to move everything and store it, and hired a professional cleaning company to get the apartment deep cleaned (\~$400). This was already more than I had hoped as I was planning on doing this all myself, but oh well. I have videos from my friend after the cleaning and you can see the apartment looks spotless.

Anyway, my landlord came into the unit and said it was heavily damaged. The main issue was some ghosting on the walls (soot), which I believe is simply due to the poor air quality, but may be my fault, I'm not entirely sure. He sent me an invoice for the damages and they totalled to over $1000, minus my damage deposit. The breakdown was super vague but said stuff like ""carpet repair - $300, closet repair - $200, wall repair - $125, paint - $200, window screen replacement - $200""...etc.

I'm pretty upset obviously because I feel as though I took very good care of the unit and am already out $800 just from paying my friend and the cleaning company. From what I've read, he has to apply to ask me for this money and he is not allowed to charge for general wear and tear (I lived there for 3 years and the walls were not repaired/painted when I moved in). Also its worth noting that he broke several of the tenancy rules by entering my apartment several times without any notice, and charging for first, last and security deposit to sign (I don't think he was allowed to ask for the last months rent).

Basically, I just don't know what to do from here. I want to fight this but I understand I may still be responsible for some things, I'm fine with him keeping the deposit but I don't think I should have to pay the rest. Does he have the right to ask me to pay for these things? If not, do I simply email him and say I don't agree?

I ran into this concern last time I was rental hunting.  Now I am once again hunting for a rental and its all coming back to me.  What really stops a landlord from collecting $30 or more per person for rental application fees from a bunch of people for a unit that either isn't available or they have no intention of renting out?

Hell, they could charge for the ""Credit check"" fee alongside a fee for their time, and they could run your credit report and still make a profit.

What stops this from happening, or does it just happen and you have to live with the fact that the place you get charged a app fee for isn't even available?

88,"[VA] Division fence dispute, advice needed",1589219730,"Several months ago I discovered through the city property website that one of the boundary fences on my property is on my side of the property line by a significant amount (~10 feet at the far end and ~3 feet near the front of my property). I have since had this confirmed with a property survey. Both my property and my neighbors is fully enclosed.

The current fence is approximately ~10 maybe 11 years old based on google maps and Virginia adverse possession starts at 15 so that is not an immediate concern but definitely a reason to not delay as the land value would be around $9,000.

My plan is to demolish the existing fence and build a new fence on the actual property line. I would like to split the cost of the fence as it equally benefits both properties. 

After a tense conversation with my neighbor they are claiming that they will not under any circumstance pay for the removal or building of a new fence. They are claiming that I must build the new division fence a couple feet on my side of the property line. Their claims are based on the following:

1. If I build a division fence they will claim that they wish for their land to lay open and therefore not split costs. 

*My rebuttal: The property is currently enclosed and they currently have a dog which they let run in there yard. They would and have benefited from the property being enclosed. This is an attempt to not pay there portion of the division fence.

2. The fence was built by the previous owner of our property so they have no liability as to it being demolished.

*My rebuttal: From referencing google maps the division fence in question was built to fully enclose there yard. My house at that time was left open. Not only that but the ""good side"" of the fence is facing their yard. It seems obvious that the owner of there property constructed the fence.

My questions for Legaladvice:

1. If I do construct a boundary fence would they be liable to pay for 1/2 even if they claim that they would like there land lay open?

2. Would they be required to pay for demolition of the current fence? Reimbursement of survey cost?

3. What documentation do I need to prepare? Do I need to notify the city that I am constructing a division fence?

They currently live in a home that he mortgages. He can't kick her out, because she will take the kids, and he's afraid of where she might take them. He can't leave because he can't afford two places at once, and doesn't have anywhere else to go. He can't reason with her, she's shown repeatedly that she won't change.

I listed it as a unlocked phone as my carrier has reassured me it was and I even checked on other carriers websites and it was all compatible.

A lady in her late 50s/early 60s was interested and so I got a ride (I can’t drive) to meet her halfway which was still an hour drive. I showed her the phone and how to use it and she checked it over and then paid and we went our separate ways. 

Next day she messaged me saying that her carrier says it’s not unlocked. I called my carrier and they said sometimes it can take up to 72hrs to be unlocked for other carriers to work. So she waited 72hrs then took it back and same thing happened- so I called again and sent her a recording of the call where they once again stated that it’s completely paid off and unlocked and suggested trying to factory reset it and then it should be fine. 

I’m out of state till later in the week and told her I wouldn’t be able to meet up till I’m back if it wasn’t working but my carrier has assured me countless times that it’s unlocked so I’d rather not have to find another ride out there if it was as sold. She’s now contacting the police. Could I be taken to small claims for this?

My wife and daughter were supposed to join me in March but once COVID started, we had to make new plans.

My wife was complaining about how hard it is to watch my daughter (5 years old) so I offered to come out to Alabama and take her back to California, which I did 3 week ago. She has been with me the past 3 weeks and has been having a great time with working and playing with her Dad. The agreement was she would get our house in Alabama ready for sale (mortgage in my name only but she is on the deed). She has not done anything on the house to prep it for sale.

My wife is....intense. She doesn't work, she doesn't contribute with keeping the household and frankly, when my daughter was in her care, she slept most of the day and barely took care of her.

I work in hospitality and I have been living in the resort (currently closed) I work in. I took a 20% pay cut and this helps offset the expense as I get to stay for free to comply with shelter in place orders. I expect to have a more formal place by the end of the month.

My wife is telling me she is getting a divorce. Our relationship has not been good for many years. This latest divorce threat is due to me blocking her multiple times when she bombards me with phone calls to yell at me. If I don't take this route, I won't get any work done or be able to focus on my daughter. 

My worry isn't so much the divorce, it's what happens with my daughter. She and I have a really strong bond and she is incredibly stressed out because my wife told her earlier today she is moving back to Alabama, which upset her greatly. Will I have to go back to Alabama (with no job) to fight this? Which state should I get a lawyer in? Will I have to hire lawyers in both states?

2,"Postponed our wedding due to COVID and photographer won't be available, refuses to give back our deposit",1589219215,"My fiancee and I (United States) were supposed to have an out-of-state wedding in June, and last month we decided to postpone.  The state our wedding was supposed to take place in currently has an order restricting gatherings to 10 people or fewer (and only for good reasons, like not weddings), requires a 14-day quarantine period for out-of-state visitors, and is not allowing anyone to book hotels until about 10 days before our wedding was supposed to happen.  There is no definite timeline on when these restrictions will be lifted.  In addition, about half of our wedding guests are healthcare workers, some of whom care directly for COVID patients, so it seemed very clear that we had to postpone.

The venue only had one Saturday available next summer (we need a Saturday since all of the guests are from out of state/country), so we booked that one.  This state is snowy all winter and the wedding is supposed to mostly be outdoors, so it wasn't an option to pick a sooner date (the venue is very popular and barely has any dates available within the next 1-2 years anyway).  All of our vendors were very understanding and we were able to book them for the new June 2021 date without any rescheduling fees.  A few of them asked us to pay the full value for their services by the time of the original wedding date (rather than just sticking with the deposit we've already paid) so they can have some financial security, and we were happy to oblige.

Our photographer, however, said that he will not be available on that date.  We had sent everyone a very thoughtful e-mail in which we explained our reasons for rescheduling and wished them well (we had really connected with each of them when we visited in the fall), and they all responded in kind except the photographer, who literally just said ""I'm not available.""  It was very odd and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  

We explained to him that the venue had no other dates available that would work for us, and he e-mailed back saying that we have two options: 1. we can pick another date when he is available next summer and there will be no rescheduling fee, or 2. we can cancel and the deposit we paid (about $1k) can be used as a ""gift certificate"" for his photography services in the future.  Problem is, this guy is based in another state and it wouldn't make sense for us to travel there just for some photos.  On top of that, we can't think of any reason why we would ever want to spend $1k on photos other than for our wedding, so we wouldn't want to go with that arrangement even if he was local.  We just want our deposit back.

So, is there anything we can do here?  Right now our decision to reschedule was ""voluntary,"" as nobody knows what the restrictions will be in June.  So, will we just not get our deposit back?  Will he need to give it back to us if, by the time our original wedding date comes around, we couldn't even have held it anyway due to restrictions being in place?  In that case, it wouldn't matter whether we had decided to reschedule or not.  What would be the reasonable thing to do here?  Is it wrong of us to want our deposit back?

Thanks!

5,[USA-CA] College has lost my paperwork multiple times and screwed up multiple times and now I am at danger of losing my degrees. What can I do?,1589218984,"Edit: California  
About 2 years ago I started at a local Community College. During my second semester, I decided to  take an English class that needed my AP Scores as a pre-req (instead of taking the first class before hand). During that time, I was a bit late in the process, so I talked to a counselor and they let me in using unofficial transcripts, with the understanding that my scores need to be officially filed before the first day otherwise I will be removed from the class.

I submitted my AP Scores and received an email from CollegeBoard saying that they had been processed. The semester started and I was never contacted about them so I figured that everything was fine.

This March (Before Shelter-In-Place) about a year later, I applied for two degrees (AA/AAT) as I would be finishing this semester and I had been accepted at a CSU for transfer with an Associates Degree for Transfer (AAT). The next day I received an email from the CSU system stating that I was potentially going to lose my transfer as my AAT had not been filed by school and I only had about a week and a half left to get it verified.

I went back to the school to talk to a counselor about it, as this was the first time I had heard about this from any source. While there, the counselor and I discovered that the school actually had a personal internal deadline of over a month ago for AAT Degree filing that at no point had ever been conveyed to any student whatsoever. The reason for the internal deadline was because it supposedly would take them over a month to verify everyone. The counselor and I were both shocked and he advised me to file a complaint with Admissions &amp; Records, as well as gave me the email of my evaluator to email and see if they could give me a timeline for which it could be expected to be filed.

The next day the school sent out an email telling all students that the deadline for AAT filings was actually in 2 days at 1 pm, forcing students to have all their paperwork and transcripts filed within 1 day. I was also told by A&amp;R afterwards that I should receive an email by the end of the week whether or not my degrees got accepted.

By Sunday, I had not received any email, and there was only 1 week left before the deadline for AA-T filings for CSUs, so I emailed my evaluator to see if I could get any information from them. I received a response the next day stating that my degrees had been denied as I was missing my AP Scores. As I thought I had those officially filed and I had the receipts for them from a year ago I was confused and told my evaluator. I was told that they can temporarily file them as accepted for my degree so they can verify me for AA-T as I had the receipts for me sending them and it was the school/collegeboards fault for them being lost. However I would have to order an official copy again before the end of the semester otherwise my degree would be denied.

I went to go and talk to A&amp;R in the hopes that it was just misfiled and could be easily found, however I was told by the staff that the situation was my fault and it would be a waste of their time to go looking for them and that I needed to reorder them. After much stonewalling, I managed to get an appointment with the Dean of A&amp;R as I felt that this whole situation was completely mismanaged. They basically told me that I needed to reorder them and that's final.

So I did directly after, and once again received an email that they had been sent to my college. My AA-T was verified on the CSU side, however I could not find any information anywhere if my AP Scores were received by my school. The school campus then closed a week later due to Shelter-In-Place.

About a week ago, I received a job offer for a job starting in June with the understanding that I will be graduating this semester. So since I still haven't received any notification on if my AP Scores were received, I contacted my school again to see if there was any way of verifying that as the official graduation date is in less than two weeks. I received an email saying that they were not sure if they had them and to give them a week before reaching out again. Its now been a week with no updates and they haven't responded and are not responding to further emails about this situation.

I expressed concerns and stated that the custody schedule would have to be altered so the kids don’t have to travel so much during the school year. The kids have sports and friends in the town we both currently reside. He has since began harassing me with hateful text messages. When we exchange kids he sticks his iPhone in my face to record the exchange. He recently started accusing me of child abuse. I was in a meeting this morning and couldn’t receive his call to talk to the children, I told him after 3pm would be best. He proceeded to call the police and have them come to my house for a wellness check. The officer did his job, the kids were in a zoom call with their teacher. The officer left and said there was nothing he could do, if they get a call they have to check. I totally understand and apologized that my ex was wasting his time during a pandemic. 

My question is how do I get this to stop? I asked him to stop texting me with hate and told him I would only discuss the children going forward but that didn’t help.

b. relates particularly to our business, or that of other persons or bodies with whom we have dealings of any sort, and 

c. has not been made public by, or with our authority,

shall be confidential, and (save in the course of our business or as required by law) you shall not at any time, whether before or after the termination of your employment, disclose such information to any person without our written consent.

On the day I started I was then told of the bosses' personal rules and religion, and i thought this is why they didn't want any disclosure. (Let's just say if I new beforehand I would've stayed away, but now I needed the money).

&amp;#x200B;

I was put to create new illustrations with their main character. A few days after I posted on Twitter that I started to work there on this. My manager immediately found out and told me to remove it.

I was told that they don't want it to be known that the original artist was not creating any more illustrations as she could not draw. The fact is I was made to correct or actually illustrate her sketches (if those were in fact hers).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to more recently, I found that they just started using my original illustrations on their products, and those seem to have been the main ones of the past few years in their collection (seems people like my work better lol).

Basically the title. I had to cancel my wedding, which was scheduled for this September, due to the pandemic, and the caterer is refusing to refund the deposit I paid them. There was no mention of the deposit being non-refundable in any of our communications prior to today, nor is it stipulated on the receipt I received after making the deposit in November. There is a pricing estimate that says the deposit is ""requested to book the date for service,"" but nothing else. Also nothing on the company's site says anything about a deposit.

Important bit: They never sent a contract. In hindsight it was probably not smart to send money without signing anything. I've never planned an event like this or worked with a caterer before so I assumed everything that was happening was just the way things worked. They said I needed to pay a deposit to book the date, so I sent it over. I know that was dumb, and it will probably make it more difficult to get anything back from them, but I'm hoping that doesn't make it impossible.

18,[CO] Will and custody questions,1589218171,"Husband and I are expecting our first baby in July. We are looking to create a will before the baby is born just to cover our butts (and hers) worst case scenario. Unfortunately right now we don’t have the money to speak with an attorney, so this will be done via a free website (but hey, something is better than nothing, right?).

Our biggest concern is custody of the baby. I am estranged from my mom who is already trying to utilize other family relations to gain access to our baby when she’s born. We suspect her next steps will be filing for grandparents rights. Why we are estranged i know is legally not relevant; the short story is she was extremely abusive and allowed her long term boyfriend to groom both myself and his daughters.

Backstory aside, we want to make absolutely certain our daughter (and any future children) never end up with her, even in a visitation capacity. What is the best way to outline this in a will? Do we just determine first, second, and third choices for custody if we are both to die? Or do we get the chance to state something to the effect that she is never to have custody or visitation with the children?

My second question is my dad (who is not with my mom) would like visitation, however due to health issues and age he is not a contender for custody. Is there a way to outline visitation with him? Or do we essentially just need to pick family we know would honor our wishes and foster a relationship between our child(ren) and him?

Also, we don’t currently have life insurance but will be looking in to this - if we do get life insurance or any new assets of significant value, do we need to update our will? (Our assets at this moment are minimal, minus a couple cars and our mortgaged home)

19,[TN] Stolen vehicle/driving without permission?,1589217879,"Throwaway. My mother had been lending her truck to a man for doing her small favors e.g. taking a bunch of old garage junk out to the dump for her. He could use the truck for a few days in return. Sometimes he would keep it longer than the agreed duration, but he would call, ask and provide a reason such as hauling wood or some such. 

&amp;nbsp;

It hasn't been a problem until he recently just didn't bring it back. He stopped responding to calls, texts etc. This was sometime in mid-April. They agreed he would have the truck back by the 12th but he didn't and my mom called the police and filed a stolen vehicle report on the 17th. At first the police said it was a felony, but after discussing it more and calling the magistrate, they said it was a joyriding misdemeanor or something along those lines. The fact that it was loaned out and not returned downgraded the offense and it would have to be a civil proceeding.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to today and we've tried to file some paperwork at the county clerk to start civil proceedings - due to COVID, the court isn't active and the alternative was to post bond on some other form (the name of which escapes me, sorry). The clerk said we could speak to the magistrate instead, which we did. The magistrate said that it looked like it could be prosecuted and to take it back up with the police department. Interestingly enough, he also said he doesn't discuss surface level details over the phone with police.

&amp;nbsp;

So we went back to the police department and they said they would go through the procedure with the magistrate but he was trying very hard to temper our expectation that something would happen. I'm ultimately pretty concerned because it seems like there is no recourse if someone steals a vehicle you loan them. My mom has all the paperwork proving ownership of the vehicle - she pays insurance on it, has the deed of sale, etc. She knows the man's name and where he lives/used to live (he may have moved). Despite all of this, it's been almost a month and there isn't really any progress down any avenue. It's just getting to be very frustrating and I'm wondering if there is something we're missing about the situation.

It's most likely due to a wire outside being cut but we didn't diagnose that for a few days.

Eventually optimum agreed to send a tech to check out the situation, scheduled for sunday. The window that we were offered was 10am to 8pm, so we waited until about 7:30, and upon calling them we were told that the appointment was cancelled because we are in a COVID hotspot. They did not let us know this before scheduling the appointment. Since then we have called optimum for roughly 2 hours each day, between being transferred and being placed on hold. Nobody gives a specific answer, with some employees saying ""We'll call you back with an appointment date"", some saying ""We are short staffed and can't get anyone out"" and other stories.

33,[VA] Company in DC Metro area is ordering employees to return to physical office and removing remote work policy permanently,1589217031,"My work (located in DC metro area) is ordering employees to return to the physical office location next Monday. While I work for what can be considered an essential business, “financial institution”, my role is not customer facing and can be done remotely with no disruptions. Prior to COVID, my colleagues and myself typically worked remotely when needed and had 1-2 days a week of regularly scheduled remote work. Since COVID, it was a seamless transition for our department as we were used to working remotely. There is no aspect of my job that needs to be completed in a physical office. However, we are still being called to report back to the office AND remote work will no longer be allowed. So while we worked remotely prior to COVID, we are no longer allowed that flexibility. 

This move seems like an unnecessary risk and very premature as the Governor hasn’t addressed whether NOVA will be easing restrictions (localities wrote a letter to him last week asking that he not ease restrictions for NOVA). The response from HR Is that we are an essential business so need to return. 

Obviously I am very distressed by this news.

34,Husband requested to pay child support for 11 year old he never knew existed.,1589216993,"I don’t know if there is actually any legal advice that can be given, but I’m at a loss right now. My husband (35 yo M) and myself (35 yo F) have been together for 8 years. Very recently we got a letter in the mail requesting he pay child support for an 11 year old girl from his hometown. Turns out the mother of this girl had also gotten on my messenger and contacted me. She thinks that she had a one night stand with my husband a dozen years ago and that he is the father. She apparently has tested a number of other men and their tests all returned negative so far. My husband does not remember this woman at all and her story makes no sense because the people he was remembered to be hanging out with that night are people he has never met. We don’t believe that he is the father, but they are requesting child support before a paternity test can even be preformed. To be honest, we don’t even want to take a paternity test because he has no interest in a relationship with this adolescent child he never knew existed, he does not believe that the child could be his and it feels very violating to us that a person can just point fingers and turn lives upside down. No matter what the truth is this is incredibly stressful. We would consider getting a lawyer or whatever it takes. If anyone has legal advice they could share with us we would appreciate it.

I understand of course that sex is an adult decision with potential adult consequences. However, taking care of a child for 11 years without trying to contact the possible fathers just robbed that child and father of the majority of her childhood relationship. If it was magically my husband, knowing how his brain works he could never have a meaningful relationship to that kid at this point. That mother took that from her child and whoever the father is. It just feels wrong that she can wait a dozen years and then decide the time is right for her to paternity test every man she thinks she had sex with that year. I will ignore her until if/when she goes to a court. Even then, the whole thing is just horrifying.

Have a bit of an odd question, that I believe I’m correct, but I want to be a little more confident.

I run a Dungeons &amp; Dragons group that has a Twitch stream where we are going to be doing some giveaways of items that I’ve made using my 3D printer under a Creative Commons - Attribution license found here ([https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4077537](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4077537)) and here ([https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)).

Obviously ***selling*** the items would be a whole different story, as there is a clear monetary return on that, selling someone else's design; but one of our players is worried that even running a giveaway for the item is a grey area, despite it falling under CC and that I'll be giving verbal and text-based credit to the designer.

The giveaway is free to enter, so we're not receiving any direct monetary gains from doing it, and I used my own 3D printer and material to make the item, so we're actually out of pocket the cost of the material and the shipping that will be required to send it to the winner. To me, that's no different than printing the item for myself and simply giving it to a friend as a present, but I want to make sure I'm understanding the CC license correctly.

Would distribution of this item via a giveaway still fall under the CC license, so long as we provide adequate attribution to the original designer when doing so?

39,[TEXAS] Legal Advice regarding the divorce proceedings of a marriage that ended due to some circumstances.,1589216815,"This is not my story. One of my friends who is going through a turmoil filled marriage and is considering divorce. This is the history between both of them.

&gt;""We got married in 2015. We have 2 kids together. We got a house together in 2014. Our marriage was great. I was happy with him because he was a hard worker, provided for us, a great dad and a great husband who treated me good.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2017, he runs into an old friend and this friend convinces him to try meth. He does and it went downhill from there. He became addicted to it and started changing. He wasn't the guy he used to be. He started taking cash out of the bank, stole from me to sell for money, stole out kids video games and coin collection to sell for money and pawned a lot of his tools. He took out credit cards and personal loans to blow on drugs. He used to sneak out in the middle of the night, sometimes took my car and stay up really late doing drugs. He started being distant with me and the kids.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first time I caught him on dating websites and a website for meeting local women he grabbed his gun and made me hold it to his head. Saying not to divorce him and to pull the trigger. Months went by and he was still using. Still doing the same thing, looking for ways to get money so he can buy drugs. He would up and leave out of nowhere and be gone for days and not answer his phone this happened about 10 times between 2018 and now. He has brought drugs in this house I have  walked in on him with the needle in his arm. I had physical altercations with him numerous times trying to grab the needle away from him.. I have gotten pricked with the needle accidentally while trying to get it away from him.   
&gt;  
&gt;He stayed a couple motels in 2019 while he was bingeing and was told by the 3rd person there he was with a woman. Not sure if anything happened between them or not. I have text messages of that. He has had dope-heads come over to our house and dealers come to the house. I have text messages from November of last year between him a dealer that he wants to buy her a phone and whatever she wants like food and stuff while trying to be sexual with her. Not sure if they did or not. He tried to convince me to use meth with him because he says it would make me feel good. I of course refused it immediately because I don’t want to ruin my life and my kids.   
&gt;  
&gt;He went to rehab in February 2019 for 33 days came out stayed sober for maybe 2 months? Then went back to his old ways. Lost his job he has had for 8 years in October 2019. Hasn’t found a steady job since. Has gotten maybe 6 traffic tickets throughout. Has gotten in 2 accidents with his vehicle and got into one accident with my car and totaled it. Got a dwi in October 2019 also. He is still currently going through court for that. ""

She recently filed for divorce. She doesnt have any wish to get lawyers involved and wants to handle this on her own and wrote that in the petition for divorce. She has a few queries:

1. She doesnt really remember whose name the house is on but they are both on the title. They both signed while closing the house. She thinks her husband is on the mortgage statement. She would prefer to live in the house but the mortgage is too much for her to afford. She doesnt know who to contact to know about the mortgage. She wants to know would it be a good idea to sell the house and split the money? If yes, how should she proceed with that?
2. She has a car that is on her name. She doesnt want to sell the car and split the money. She wants to keep the car. Will she have to sell the car and split the money or can she keep it?
3. She wants to keep the kids with herself so that she can provide them with a safe upbringing. But she is really confused on primary and joint custody. Can you help her with how to do either of those and what would be the better option?
4. She wants for this to be an uncontested divorce. But if it is not, she will be willing to bring up his drug use and all during the proceedings. How should she do that? What should she compile to have with her during the proceedings? 
5. She doesnt earn anything at the moment but she filed for primary custody will she get it? Even though she is not working?

I've been furloughed (25 hours per week instead of 40) due to the pandemic. My salary before furlough was $134,000/year. My salary is \~$83,750/year on reduced hours.

My employer mentioned that many of us are eligible for some UI benefits so we can get in the EDD system if we choose to. They also were applying for a work sharing program but there would be a big delay due to Covid related volume.

So I filled out the online form for UI benefits. It was not straightforward in terms of furloughed employment my opinion. I swear that I tried to fill it out honestly. Basically every one of my coworkers (who I know make roughly the same amount as I do) also applied for UI benefits.

Now I've received a statement of my benefits and it's quite a bit more than I expected: $1,050/week. Annualizing this ($54,600) and adding it to my reduced work salary ($83,750), my new total compensation ($138,350) is MORE than my previous salary ($134,000).

Many of my co-workers have started to swipe their EDD cards but I feel like something is off. I'm not infallible, it's quite possible I made a mistake when filing my initial claim, but the EDD's website does not allow you to even look at the details of your previous claim.

44,I'm involved in a wrongful death for my Father and suddenly my attorney wants to settle for cost of defense. Thoughts and Advice?,1589216470,"I'm sorry for the long post, but I don't know my options and what's best. Any guidance is appreciated. 

My father died very tragically about 7 years ago. He was an alcoholic with a history of entering in and out of rehab. He was admitted for detox treatment into a hospital that he had been to before under the supervision of a doctor that knew his history and he trusted.

If you know anything about detoxing, most people get Delirium Tremens and lose all sense of reality. In the past, my dad would try to escape the hospital, thinking they were kidnapping, experimenting on him, etc. Well this last time he was having an episode and allegedly voluntarily checked himself out in the middle of winter. No shoes, no jacket, nothing.

The hospital only provided a very shaky signature that he allegedly signed checking himself out. Additionally, all of his belongings disappeared as well as any video footage. 

I'm the middle of winter, he walked about a mile towards ""home"" in this delerious state, presumably got tired, layed down, and froze to death.

It then snowed and they didn't find his body for 2 months. Additionally, animals ate at his body after death and he was missing body parts including both feet. 

Now my father was very smart, and could lie and manipulate people and this came out when he drank. At the time of his death, I wasn't on good terms with him, and I regrettably said unfavorable things about him that were documented in the police reports. 

Fast forward to today and my attorneys are saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has put doctors on a pedestal. So, that in addition to the unfavorable things that were said about him and his in and out of rehab history, our chances of winning are very low. They want us (my brother, my sister, and myself) to settle. We would each walk away with 10k. If we don't take the offer, they are suggesting they will walk away from the case and we would need to find new council to take this to trial. (The new council would also have to pay them what their owed with any winning) They also said we need to answer by the end of the week. 

Personally, I'm very upset by this and believe that my dad's life was worth more than 10K. I also kind of feel like 7 years is a ridiculously long time for this to drag on. They haven't introduced experts or anything. I may be ignorant about it, though.

The way my attorneys are talking makes me believe that this isn't necessarily the best decision for all, it's the best decision for them. It seems like they want to get out of a lot of their cases without losing money in anticipation of the future recession. So they are quickly trying to settle up. 

My questions are, does anyone have any input on this as a whole.

53,Employer benefit issue,1589215608,"Last year I was employed by a state agency in California. One of my employment benefits was insurance (health, dental, vision), which was to be active on the first day of my second month.  Due to a clerical error, my insurance cards and policy documents were sent to an unknown address. I brought the issue up to my supervisor and local HR person, who brushed me off and told me ""just call Blue Cross"". I did that, and they couldn't verify my identity (because my address and phone number were incorrect), and consequently couldn't verify whether I had insurance, change the address, or send documents. This went on monthly for six months, during which time I escalated the issue to the HR person at headquarters, her two bosses, and eventually the director of HR for the entire agency. None of this resolved the problem and I effectively went without insurance for six months.

The problem is that during the second month of employment, I seriously injured myself. I went to the ER (and paid out-of-pocket), but was unable to begin the physical therapy that my doctor prescribed until many months later, when the insurance issue was resolved. I recently had about six weeks of PT, which helped a bit, but then Covid shutdown happened. Now my condition has regressed to where it was originally. 

My concerns are: 1) The delay in treatment caused my body to heal improperly.  2) As a result I have limited range of motion in my arm, and also can't sleep on my side.  3)  I'm afraid this may be a permanent condition, as my condition regressed to baseline when PT was stopped.

54,"Ex pushing for unfair stipulations in custody agreement, leaving me with more financial strain. Please help.",1589215519,"Hello everyone, 

I’ve been working on a custody order with my ex regarding our 4 year old son. We live in California. It’s been two years since I started the papers and he has yet to sign them. Recently he decided to add to the papers stating that whoever pays for my sons healthcare gets to claim him on their taxes. I’ve been claiming my son since the day he was born, his father and I were never married. Because I claim him, both my son and I receive Medi-Cal as we are eligible for the support (and need it). My ex refuses to pay Child support because he is active in my sons life and doesn’t agree that it’s fair even though I make significantly less than he does. I’ve always tried to pull my own weight and take care on my son by my own means, so I haven’t fought him much with child support, however this changes things. I’m not sure it’s even a valid stipulation. If he decides to start paying for healthcare for my son and claims him as a dependent without my knowledge, it will no longer deem me eligible for Medi-Cal, but I won’t be receiving child support on top of that, or tax breaks. So while he gets to save more money from taxes and not paying child support, I will be driven deeper down the hole having to pay additional healthcare bills that frankly I cannot afford.

55,"At-Will State. Friend was told their position was being phased out, when it wasn't. Is that wrongful termination?",1589215502,"Friend was terminated in CA an at will state, told the position was being phased out and not returning until Spring 2021 and now there's a posting online a week later for the exact same job...is that wrongful termination?

I only ask because I've seen the same think happen at my company, in PA also an at will state. A coworker was let go and they were told their position was being phased out...only that wasn't the truth because that same day the company brought in a new employee to replace them. The employee that was terminated found out a few weeks later and spoke with a lawyer. It ended up being settled out of court and the employee was left on payroll for the following year and also received benefits.To my understanding it was just that they lied, had they just said ""you're fired"" it wouldn't have been an issue.

Is it wrongful termination in an at will state to lie and say a position is being phased out when that's not actually the case?

57,[IP] [USA] What are the rules surrounding using scientific concepts as a business name (e.g. CRISPR),1589215438,"United States:  Some scientific concepts are super old and generic, so I wouldn't have a problem naming my company Gravity or something. But what about some of the newer concepts that have coined new words within the last few years?

I'm thinking about something like CRISPR. I know that universities generally get IP rights to whatever their scientists create, but does naming something or creating a word create some kind of IP right where nobody else can use it?  There are a lot of CRISPR-related trademarks registered, but it's such a small number that I can't tell if most of them might be the IP holder or somehow have gotten permission. It's also interesting that the actual word ""CRISPR"" has not been registered... I wonder if this is because it's unable to be registered for some legal reason?

So my question is, could someone name a business CRISPR? Like, when a scientist names something, does that just create a new word that everyone can use and it's basically in the public domain, or is it copyrighted or trademarked somehow? Just asking about the name, I know the actual technology is patented (probably).

Side question—is there some reason why this would be technically legal, but just really uncool? Like how, technically, you can open a lawsuit against anyone and everyone, but if you do that too many times you're really just a giant jerk, you know?

59,"Broken contract, Fired over bonuses &amp; various issues - help needed",1589215266,"Context:

So I started working with a company back in October 2019 as a business developer for an online business.

This was a self employed contracted position that was offered to me.

I was offered to be paid £X/Hr + % of sales if I hit certain sales targets.

So the issues:

When  I eventually hit the sales targets in Februrary and asked about the  bonus I was told that they wouldn't be paying it  &amp; that if I'm not  happy with the hourly rate alone then I can leave.

I  was let go from this job in the middle of March - this was put down to  budget cuts &amp; the corona virus but I don't believe any of this at  all.

I believe I was fired from  this position in order to avoid paying the bonus, as this was never  resolved &amp; I was recieving passive aggressive emails ever since I  asked about it, so clearly they were not very happy about the idea of  paying me the bonus.

What can I do with all of this legally?

In terms of evidence:

Everything is over email so I have all the emails - main ones being where my original contract with bonuses was set out.

Also another email where the bonus was refused to be paid.

Another email where I was let go not long after the issues with the bonus &amp; given a load of bs excuses.

I  managed to get in contact again 2 weeks ago after being ignored for 2  months &amp; I was just told that she doesn't need to explain herself.

Can  anybody please advise me if I can possibly sue for wrongful termination  or something along these lines? I did nothing wrong &amp; even have an  email from her admitting that it's nothing personal.

I am also owed money from this bonus but the value is around £400-500 so probably not worthwhile for that alone.

TLDR:

Fired  from a job over a company not wanting to pay a bonus - I have evidence  that can be linked back to this potentially &amp; emails laying out the  contract &amp; also emails of refusal to pay the bonus.

Any advice much appreciated.

I go to a private college in the US and when COVID happened, we were sent home. I highly rely on financial aid and my scholarship covers my tuition before room and board. I don't understand why I don't get more financial aid than I due (considering my family's income is &lt;60k a year...anyways), but we still have to pay a fair amount out of pocket. When reimbursement for r&amp;b came back, they greatly reduced my refund. 

I questioned them about the refund, saying that my scholarship covers tuition first so my reimbursement shouldn't be affected and they told me that, due to COVID, anyone who received scholarships had some of their scholarship proportionally taken away (thus the amount out of pocket could be kept for tuition). I feel like this is really wrong. I paid tuition this semester with the knowledge of the financial aid package I was receiving, I can't afford $3000 because they decided to take away thousands of dollars from each person receiving a scholarship. I understand there is a tentative financial aid, but upon paying tuition each semester, I feel like you can't suddenly take away money from scholarships and expect students to pay more than they anticipated so the school doesn't take as much of a financial hit.

64,"MA - employer breaking laws, where do I start?",1589215025,"I loved my job, but over the last 2 years it's become unbearable and unethical and I'm not sure where to start. I've seen the writing on the wall and gathered the evidence I could, and after a truly atrocious response to the pandemic that put people at risk and closed an entire store that shouldn't have been open at all, due to the staff getting covid, I'm ready to lay my cards on the table. The company has approx 50-100 employees, one owner who handles buying and in store stuff, and one executive with the titles of CFO/Head of HR (even though those are conflicting positions imo). In the spirit of transparency,  I have brought up all of these issues with the owner and/or executive, and I'm either ignored or told I don't know what I'm talking about. 

I have written proof of:
Emails confirming no employee breaks were offered prior to 2015, company wide. From 2015-2019, employees were allowed 20 minute meal breaks for every 6 hours worked. Starting June 2019, employees were finally given 30 minutes per 6 hours worked

One of the brick and mortar locations is open right now, not for curbside, allowing people in to shop illegally, despite governor mandate. The store was denied for essential. Employees are told to say they are essential, and since a few police have come in and haven't said anything ""it must be fine."" (It seems like fraud is being committed with employees working full time hours to ""pay back their health insurance premiums from furlough"" but  are also getting UI, but I have no direct proof so will leave it at that).

Before the shutdown when people were panicking, one store was sent live ammo to sell, despite having no active license to do so, and only one employee familiar with the process. The license to sell in that town expired January 2020, and my concerns about this were ignored. 

Employee handbook prohibits employees from discussing their wages under the threat of termination. 

Not sure if MA has price gouging laws, but hard to find PPE was sourced in March. What normally sells for $2 was sold for $20. Nurses were calling begging for discounts or our source and we were instructed to give neither, they could buy at the going rate. 

MA state mandated paid sick time for part time employees was allowed to be used as vacation time from the day it was implemented until 2019, despite MA having a specific set of things it can be used for. 

MA Sunday rate was not paid to staff in smaller stores that had less than 7 employees, despite the company having 50+ MA employees (not sure if they were right and it's by physical location and figured I'd bring it up). In ""good faith"" they changed this last year and all staff are eligible for MA Sunday x1.4. 



Other things:
For profit business accepts ""donations."" And the company gets a lot of donations. People drop things off thinking they're helping those in need. But those products just get some random price and sold. The IRS would love to know I'm sure, since these items show they were bought and paid full retail cost from a vendor, when in actuality the cost was $0. 

3rd party sales for age restricted items are encouraged. If a group of high school kids come in and a 17 year old asks to buy a knife he is denied. If his friend comes up right after for the same item and is 18, the sale is encouraged, even if you overhear the kids planning this. 



Sorry this got so lengthy, I just need some help, and seriously, thanks if you're still with me. At this point, I want out no matter what. It would also be nice to be able to collect unemployment or get some type of severance, but even if I have to walk away with nothing, I will. My hope is that something will chance for the current and future employees who are sticking it out, and that the upper management will finally learn that they can't do whatever they feel like it.

Hi!
This is a continuation of a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/g72271/my_fathers_tenant_is_threatening_to_bring_me_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Some things have happened in the last few weeks. 

On Thursday, we called the cops because of several threatening voice messages, texts and conversations. 

I'm going to try to link the audio here, there's about 6 minutes worth. 

A run down of the audio is as follows:
*She's threatening to do black magic and curse the family (lol)
*Keeps saying things like ""you don't know who I am, you don't know what I'm capable of""
*You have 24 hours. After that, it's done. 

Ect. Ect.

Cops were called because she was calling over and over in the middle of the night to threaten the dad. 
The dad has an anxiety issue that causes his blood pressure to sky rocket and he's terrified she's going to do something to land him in jail. 

She told him she was going to call the cops and tell them he was serving minors because he bought someone alcohol (in their 30s), she gave the tenant(27) some alcohol, and then the tenant served a minor. She has convinced him that because of this, she can get him arrested. 

When the cops came, they were shown the bill of sale and some of the recordings. He advised us to get the dad to start the eviction process. He went and talked to the tenant and there was a lot of yelling. 

Basically she kept asking if it was illegal for her to do black magic and buy voodoo dolls. The cops said no, told her there was a no contact order and to leave everyone alone and forget about the cat and to get a new one. 

Today the tenant called and said that because the daughter won't let her see the cat, she's going to call the cops and lie until the dad gets arrested. We did not get it on recording as it happened before we were awake. She also told him that because of the no contact charge, and her being on probation, she has been taken off the ""good list"", now she has to go to her meetings weekly, and she's pissed. She's threatening the cops more, and has caused the landlord to have an extreme anxiety attack to the point he passed out from high blood pressure. 

I am afraid for both my friends, and her dad's, safety. He wants her to call and drop the charges and let her see the cat. She won't allow it (rightfully) and the tenant is driving them crazy. With the current world issues, she cannot be evicted until at least June.


What do we do? Should I call her parole.officer and send her the voice recordings? What should I do to protect my friends dad from her lies?

75,Need advice regarding a trial for license suspension.,1589214333,"Good morning,

I'm an 18 year old high school student who recently had a presumed seizure/lapse of consciousness, and, as a result, my license was suspended as of 9 May (my birthday, haha.) I don't have a lot of memory of the night although I don't believe it is a reoccurring problem and we will soon have testing to prove or disprove my claims.I received an order of suspension in the mail on May 7th, 2019 and have been informed that I must request a hearing date within 14 days of receiving the order, and they will send me the date that I have been given.

I come here requesting a bit of help. I've never been much into legal things, but seeing as having my license is a need for me and my family, I am more than willing to collect whatever I need to ensure that the trial goes in my favor and my license is instated again. I've been a provider of income through my employment, especially during COVID-19, and to get to work I make a 20 mile commute- I can't afford to uber every day.

I'm gathering information I can use to prove my point: a letter from my primary care doctor, the results of the pending EEG scan, my work history (which would show that I was working extensive hours and trying to balance school and work- helping disprove this is a concurrent medical problem) and my clean driving record, as well as the fact that my Type 1 Diabetes is well under control (under 7.5 A1c) and we are purchasing a continuous glucose monitor to ensure that this was not diabetes related and if it was, it won't happen again.

My biggest question is if a lawyer would be necessary in this case, and if so, what specifically to look for. I've never been to court before (I'm freshly 18 years old) so I'm a bit unsure as to what the correct path to take is. If there are any other documents that would ensure I get my license reinstated first trial, I would love to know what those might be- this is extremely important for me, my future, and my family, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

I appreciate any suggestions, and please send any questions. I'd love to make more clear, if needed.

I'm in WV in the USA so he was able to be there for the birth because I think that matters. My husband was forced to leave the hospital however, after we found out the second baby girl died. He was thrown out  because he tried to shake me and slap me because he thought I had cheated as no one from his family would have a dead baby and a dark baby due to I dont even remember. I was drugged out.

Fast forward three weeks and I'm living at my mother's taking care of my twins while mourning. My husband served me divorce papers two weeks ago and requested a paternity test. We did it and they are without a doubt his. 

He is still saying they arnt his but I dont care anymore. I just want to know the quickest way to get child support that will cover the cost of two babies until I can go back to work. Also could I request for him to let me back into my house so I can stop imposing on my elderly mother. If it helps, the house was bought by me before the marriage. He has changed the locks though so I am stuck at my mothet. And I dont want him to have custody until the babies are older due to his behavior these last few weeks.

You might also want to know that I did not want children and he did but agreed not to have them to stay with md. The condom used to break a lot and before the birth he confessed he used to either break them or poke holes in them so id get pregnant. My mother thinks that illegal but I dont have that confession down somewhere because I forgave him for that breech of my trust the day before my water broke. I was orginally suppsoed to get a c section but I couldn't due to that.

80,I am South African and I want to claim my American economic impact payment. I need to know where I stand.,1589213910,"Good day r/legaladvice.

# Context

I (24M) a South African, worked in America 2017-2018 as an H2B foreign worker. I worked in the carnival industry if anyone wants to know. My sister is a fully-naturalized American, we'll call her ""Emma"".

&amp;#x200B;

I came back home to South Africa somewhere in November 2018. During sometime in May 219, Emma was kind enough to do my 2019 tax return, which I was very happy about, being a foreigner and not knowing that money was owed to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I've come home, I've been unemployed ,burning through all the savings I made whilst working in America. I've been trying to go back to work in America again (before corona), with various companies but nothing worked out.

# Present 

Here comes my dilemma. About a week ago, Emma get a letter in her mail - my economic impact payment. When she showed it to me, I had to laugh at the heading, which reads ""My fellow American"" but I did recognize that this was a stimulus package, and first thought was ""Don't get your hopes up"". My heart was beating fast, thinking about everything I could do with this money. $1200 is equal to R22,000 in my currency (Rands) which is about as much as a damn good salary, here in SA. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, Emma sent me the letter because she thought the money was sent to my American bank account, I advised her that they had been closed before I left. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went and did as much research as I possibly could, with my only thought being ""Where is this money"". I concluded that the IRS sent her that stimulus payment, based on the 2019 tax return she did for me. She told me she'll look into it next week.

Next week comes and she confirms that she has the money. Problem is, she's scared of this money, as it could land her up in a lot of trouble if this was a mistake. She doesn't know what to do now. What if this was a mistake and the IRS pick it up and then debit her account $1200.. or worse, charge her with fraud or something to that effect. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any kinds redditors out there who could advise my sister and I, where we stand on this issue. I've already made peace with that fact that this money likely isn't meant for me and I probably won't receive it.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I legally eligible for this payment? 

What are the chances it was a mistake?

What are the chances of the IRS recognizing their mistake and then ask for the money back?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would help.

81,Gym Charging During COVID &amp; Won't Refund - Is this okay?,1589213888,"Hi guys,

I posted yesterday but realized that my title was misleading. I have also tried to read the Vermont consumer protection legal stuff but I don't understand it which is how I got here.

I live near Burlington and have a gym membership which, to be honest, is more than I want to pay but it is nice and has changed my life. I use the gym daily and shower there, so COVID added some costs to my life. Regardless of my situation of being unemployed due to COVID (and unable to get unemployment), I recently found out that my gym has continued to charge its members.

I called asking about this, since I assumed it would be suspended until reopening. 1. the gym owner will not give a refund, claiming the email said they would continue charging (it was vaguely worded saying nothing about continuing to charge, rather it asked for support as they navigate this crisis) 2. they say that they legally can because they have been posting facebook videos

This situation irks because since the high living costs, combined with new challenges, puts me in a situation where I really cannot afford to pay $160 for two months of a gym membership I can't use and their inability to be flexible and give a 2 month extension is bizarre. I feel deceived by their lack of transparency and sneaky language, but they claim they legally can continue to charge.

More simply, my gym is charging me for a service I cannot use and I have a contract there (for automatic billing and membership). They will not refund for the months I didn't know I was being charged. Does anyone know VT law to help me understand if this is actually legal?",legaladvice,False,groovyguy89,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghqnew/gym_charging_during_covid_wont_refund_is_this_okay/
82,Landlord is forcing us to replace tenant otherwise we will be kicked out,1589213739,"Hi guys, I’m using the mobile app so apologies for any strange formatting.

I’m currently living in Belfast, Northern Ireland. I’ve been renting in a flat share for 6 months now. It was originally a short term tenancy, beginning in November and due to end in April as my landlord uses this flat for Airbnb during the summertime. My landlord allowed us to extend our tenancy by one month (to May) with the idea that we would be moving out after that.

I live with two other tenants, who I’ll call “John” and “Joseph”. None of us knew each other prior to move in day.

Myself and John began a relationship at the beginning of our tenancy and have been together ever since, which our landlord is aware of. Joseph is from Scotland, and decided to move out of the flat when lockdown began as it made more sense for him financially to move back home with his parents, however all his possessions are still in his room. 

Once Joseph moved out, my landlord let myself and John extend the tenancy by one year, however stated that it would be OUR responsibility to replace Joseph’s tenancy with a new tenant or both John and I would be responsible for £1200 to cover the three rooms. 

(My room is £375 a month, John’s room is £375 a month and Joseph’s room is £450 a month as it is equipped with an en suite)

As we are going through a pandemic, I have been put on furlough and am getting partial payment from universal credit (which my landlord is aware of). John is still working and therefore is receiving a regular wage, however he has been emailed today by his work union stating that the company is going under reconstruction and ultimately many workers will be layed off (most likely him, too).

My landlord has text John this morning saying that now that the Prime Minister is easing some of the lockdown restrictions, we are expected to find a new tenant to replace Joseph immediately or we will be expected to pay the £1200, which we can’t afford.

Obviously we are going through a pandemic, house share websites are not advising that house viewings take place and we know no one personally that we can get to move in. We have explained this to our landlord and we’re awaiting his response.

I’m not going to lie, I’m freaking out that my landlord is going to kick us out and we will have nowhere to go. I’m not working, and as far as I’m aware the government are only furloughing until July which is a major stress for me financially. I’ll not have the money to put down another deposit and months rent upfront for a new apartment, and John will literally have to go to a homeless shelter because he has no other alternative if he is kicked out.

I’m clueless when it comes to this kind of thing. I’ve tried calling Citizens Advice but I just missed them, they were closing for the day. I’m considering contacting my solicitor to see what he says.

Any advice would be super helpful.

They took on this dog when a friend recommended them to someone who couldn't care for it as they were suffering a mental health laps (with all the covid stress only exacerbating it). They don't know the owner but have heard he's not gotten better and has spent some time in hospital.


It was proposed to them as a 2 week thing, but it's coming up to 2 months with no communication about an end date and they LOVE this dog. They were told it was stand offish and didn't like affection, but a few days with them and it was a cuddly love puddle, sleeping on the kids beds and laying on laps.


They want to do the right by the dog, the owner and their family - who is getting extremely attached. The owner doesn't look like they will be able to take the dog back anytime soon and communication is just some emojis in reply to the photos of the dog the family sends him. They are hoping the owner offers for them to keep him. A fear is they have him for half a year or years and settle into him being part of their family only to have him taken away on the owners whim.


Does anyone know the legality around this?  How long can the owner disappear before they have a claim? And what would they need to do to get custody or ownership?


What do they need to do to set up custody arrangements or clearer guidelines around maybe sharing the dog with the owner if he does get better and want the dog back?

1,"My parents [50] are blackmailing me [23] to take out a $20,000 loan to give to them.",1589212394,"Really new to Reddit. I've posted this before on Relationship Advice, but got referred here.

My parents have 2 mortgages, one is theirs in a different city where they live with my multiple younger siblings (4, tweens and teenagers). The other mortgage is for my house, where my name and theirs is on the title. My parents bought me a car when I was in high school and paid it off years ago when I just started university. The vehicle is owned by them, but it is registered and insured under my name. I pay all insurance, maintenance fees and gas for the vehicle. I also pay for all of the expenses such as utility bills, mortgage, insurance, security, etc. associated with my house (owned by me and my parents).

I live with and share expenses with my partner. We both recently graduated, and just got jobs a few months ago. We both have student loans. Unfortunately, I was temporarily laid off due to COVID-19. My partner works from home, but finances are obviously tight.

My parents generally are bad with money. Despite being in the midst of a pandemic, they upgraded one of their cars and have bought new house furniture. They also have to pay $30,000 worth of home repairs.

I have lent money to them in the past, and they have not paid me back (though these amounts were only hundreds to a thousand dollars, nowhere near as much as they were asking for now). They have asked me to lend them $5000 before to help pay the $30,000 for their home repairs, but I declined since at that time, I was still looking for a job.

My parents randomly approached me and my partner and asked us to take out a $20,000 loan in my name. I asked why. They explained that they are refinancing their house, and need to show the lender they have an ""unencumbered"" $20,000. They said that the loan would be in my name, however they would be the ones paying it back, and there would be ""no risk to me"" since they would be able to pay off the loan by January 2021 by paying in monthly instalments.

I immediately declined. I stated that I was not working, and did not feel comfortable taking out a loan. Not only this, but I stated that in my current position, I likely wouldn't be approved. My parents pointed me to the loaner that would allegedly lend me money despite my unemployment, ""for my credit score alone"". (my credit score is average, at best)

I checked out the loaner's website, which boasted same-day loans up to $50,000. Interest rates were somewhere around the 30% range.

I restated my refusal. My parents started to get angry. They continued to say that there was no risk to me, that they would be able to pay it off. They were furious that I doubted they would be able to pay the loan for me, and said ""do you think we would screw over family?!"" They have also said that I don't understand how mortgages work, and told me to ""go take a Finance 1000 course and educate myself to change my poor perspective"". They also told me to ""go smoke weed and calm down"" (they know I regularly use medicinal marijuana, it is legal where I live).

I cited their other expenses and debts (there are even more than what I listed previously), and generally continued to say that due to the current state of the economy, it wasn't unreasonable for me to be cautious in trusting anyone to pay off a loan in my name.

They continued to get angry and defensive, saying that I was disrespecting them for all they had done for me, and that this was the ""ultimate betrayal"". I said that I did not want to be accountable for paying back this loan, in the extremely likely event that they would not be able to pay for it.

They decided to switch gears. They started saying that since they owned my vehicle, and that they needed me to pay them $20,000. (The vehicle is 7 years old... I don't know that it would even be worth this much)

I rely on my vehicle for transportation (my job involves being able to travel to different locations outside of city limits). And obviously, I can't afford to buy a new one. They ignored my position, and proceeded to draft a contract which said I would agree to pay them $25,000 for the car (mysteriously larger than the initial amount they requested of me).

Again, I refused to sign. I stated that I was paying all expenses associated with the vehicle, that it was a teenaged ""gift"" to me, and that I would be happy to buy it off of them once I was working again.

Throughout the day, I also received several e-mails from loan-matching and credit checking websites that they had applied me to. I confronted them about this and they said ""we thought you would cooperate with us"".

They are now threatening to kick me out of the house and take my car. I am legally on title for the mortgage, so I am fairly certain they can't throw me out. But I am still very afraid of my parents showing up at my house and wrecking havoc. Not only this, but they continue to harass my partner and I in attempt to guilt-trip us and ""educate us"" on how we are wrong, how we are disrespectful, and how they will seize my car and force us to find new accommodations.

The craziest part - my younger sibling \[22\] who is working full-time already agreed to apply for a loan on the first day they asked me, and was in the process of getting approved the entire time they were harassing me (this has been going on for several days now).

I have had to freeze my credit, change all my passwords, and now I am going to have to figure out how to buy my parents out of my mortgage. I told them that once I was working again and able to figure things out, I would buy my car from them and transfer titles on everything.

My parents are STILL sending messages and e-mails to my partner and I, saying how terrible we are for ""not trying to help them"", and restating how much they have done for us. My parents went as far as to break down their ""total investment in me"", from times they've helped me pay rent in the past to groceries they've bought me. They keep trying to corner me into agreeing to ""pay back their full investment in me"".

They've sent me messages saying ""this will not be on your terms"", and outlining a ""payment agreement"" for my car starting THIS MONTH, at around $450 dollars a month plus 5% interest, until I am able to ""pay the rest in full"" once my employment resumes.

I am not sure if I am in the wrong here, and I do not know how to proceed. I don't even know what I am asking for in terms of advice, but any insight would be great.

TLDR - Parents and I share title on my mortgage. I pay for all expenses associated with my house. Parents own my car, but it is licensed and registered in my name. I pay all expenses associated with my vehicle, and it was paid off several years ago. My parents are trying to use my house and my car to corner me into taking out a 20K loan in my name that they claim they will pay off for me. When I refused to do this, they are now trying to corner me into signing a contract to buy my car from them.

I own a house located on a small river in Washington (Pilchuk River). With summer on its way I always have problems with people wanting to party and hang out on the river bank. Some days it feels more like a public park than my private property. Part of the problem is this section of river bank is not equipped to be a park. Leaving me picking up after people, including glass bottles, trash (oh so much trash), and even dirty diapers. No public bathrooms means my property turns into a free-for-all. On top of that, it is a constant battle to plant plants for erosion protection, which people promptly walk over and destroy. There are also multiple public parks along the river a few miles away.

Based on my [research](https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&amp;context=sulr), the river I live on seems to fit more into the non-navigable river.

Fiance and I are moving across the country at the end of this week. On the way through, we'll be stopping back home in Iowa to rest for a bit. I'm only able to stay for 2 days due to work, my fiance will stay for a week or two since she hasn't seen her family for a while.

21,Terminating Parental Rights,1589209790,"Hello all,

I'm seeking advice on how to terminate my ex husband's parental rights, so that if anything happens to me, my husband retains custody of our son. 

My ex husband and I divorced in 2015. Our paperwork states I have primary custody, and he has visits. However, we had to return to court because he violated the agreement (had female romantic partners stay the night, failed to pay child support, sent the child home covered in bed bug bites, failed to separate assets resulting in a car in my name being repossessed, etc.) 

My attorney at the time advised me that I didn't have to send my son to his house if I felt it was unsafe, and my ex would have to take me back to court to argue it - he never did take me back, even when I suggested going back to modify the child support amount when he took a lower paying job. He bounced from job to job preventing me from having any child support garnished, and hasn't paid child support since 2017. 

I remarried in 2017, my son calls his stepfather ""daddy."" We moved to Texas from Georgia, with my ex husband's blessing - ex even briefly moved to TX to be close, then moved back to GA after one month, stating he needed to take a job there. I found out later his new child's mother was seeking child support so he moved back to increase custody options.

Recently, due to issues with a house he was renting from me ($9000 of back rent and property damages, house was beyond unsafe for a child), I stated that I felt it was in everyone's best interest to cut off communication. He said ""do what you need to do, and good luck."" I have this in a screenshot. 

That's the backstory, here's the issue: what steps do I need to take to terminate his parental rights and have my husband adopt my son? Son already has new husband's last name because it's my name and a TX court granted it. My concern is if something happens to me, legally ex husband would be able to take my son and husband would end up in a legal battle he would most likely lose. Ex husband is now dealing drugs again, is a convicted felon, refuses to hold a job or have steady income, and family is no better. Ex has shown no interest in being in son's life, except posting memories on Facebook and being shouted out by his friends on Father's Day. Suffice it to say that I would prefer my son to stay with the dad who has raised him since 2016 and is actually a good parent.

24,"My three month long internship won’t pay me after firing me days before the end of it (Arizona,US)",1589209140," On my first day I signed a one page one paragraph contract where the creative director signed on the document promising me seven hundred and fifty dollars for the three months and gave me the original document. The internship was for 3 months. I was in charge of making logos, business cards, and social media posts for their clients. The assignments were given to me verbally with no creative brief and sometimes barely anything information on the company whatsoever. 

Then when the corona virus lockdown took into effect I worked from home getting text messages from work of logos that they needed completed. For example “Hey, can you do a logo for this company?” That was all the information I had ever received from the art director. One week before the end of my internship there was a discrepancy with one of my logos and I was then asked to come into the office to discuss the situation. The art director and creative director of the company then gave me the talk that it looks like I plagiarized their logo and if I were the original company could sue the company and they could sue me. I showed them my process and doodles of how I replicated the logo. They said they didn’t want to ruin my career before it even started and decided to forgive me and move on from this incident. I began working in the office that same day and the art director asked if there were any other similar logos to look out for. I said yes, it would be good to check. He asked me how to do that and I showed him in exact detail on the spot on how to check if the other logos were ok. Sadly, they were similar to my designs I had provided for the company. I was then brought into the conference room and the creative director said “we can’t have you in the office if we think you are stealing logos from other companies. We are going to send you home and the Creative director will call you tomorrow.” 

 The next day I waited anxiously for the phone call from the creative director, but instead I was told over email that my internship was terminated immediately. I replied back, and told them I understood their decision, but asked if I was still going to be compensated for the work I did. I only had a few days left of the internship. I reached out to the person that kept timesheets and we were able to put together a total ($687.50) for the work I did minus the days I had missed due to my early termination. I still have not gotten a response. I was wondering if I would be able to take them to small claims or court or have any recourse for getting the money that was in the *contract*.

&amp;#x200B;

I have this dog. I've had her for 3 years I'm the one that takes care of her. She's a good dog. But the other day she bit my father. It was the *first time* this happened. That happened because my dad was trying to shake me because he was mad at me. My dog is afraid of yells and sudden moves. My dad was trying to shake me and my dog tried to protect me.  He stepped on her also so she bit him, it wasn't so bad he almost wasn't bleeding. My dog *never* bites, I trained her well. 

So now my dad says my dog needs to die and he wants me to do it or he's going to do it. I won't  do that ever. My dog isn't dangerous at all it was just one time to protect me because she panicked. In was in self defense one could say. He says if we don't put the dog down we can be arrested for keeping a dangerous animal. I don't think that's true but I'm not sure.

So I'd like to know if it's true that my dog needs be put down. And if my father has the right to do it, and if we can be arrested if we don't. Thank you

I posted earlier about a number of dead trees on my neighbor's property that threaten to fall onto my house/property (two fell this weekend on my front lawn). It looks like I'm SOOL on the trees that already fell. But to protect myself moving forward, I need to document the remaining dead trees via an arborist, and then send notice to my neighbors that the trees are dead and I am formally requesting they remove them. It appears from a liability standpoint, if the neighbors are made aware of the issue beforehand, they will be responsible for the removal when the trees do inevitably fall (which would likely require court action).

Here's the rub: I am quite certain the neighbors will refuse to sign for any certified/registered mail I send them. In an earlier dispute, I sent them a registered letter, and that's what they did: refused to accept it. The post office tried to deliver it for about a month, then gave up and returned it to me.

44,Estate Dispersal with Untrustworthy Executor,1589207714,"Hi.   My father-in-law died in Sept 2019.   His estate, comprised of cash  and investments (no physical property as he was in a month-to-month  assisted living place), totaled \~$140k.   His daughter was named  executor of his new will after his spouse (her mother) died in 2008 and  he moved to FL.

In the intervening  years (2008-2012) the daughter mismanaged his money, spent &gt; 100k on  herself and in 2012 when her siblings caught wind, had the courts  examine his mental capacity (deemed unable to manage his finances) and  removed POA and access to his finances.  They hired an independent  accountant to manage his money for the last 7 years.

Given  that his will was written in 2008, naming her the executor, here we are  today with her managing the final dispersal of his funds.   The man  died 8 months ago and the estate has still not been settled.   The  independent accountant filed the final accounting in December to the  courts (we have copy of that).

When  asked, she claims she's waiting for a 1099 from the Dept of Defense (he  was career Navy) to do his taxes.  This seems nonsensical to us as it's  May 2020 and he died in Sept 2019.

So  the question is, what is the best way to get a true status on the  estate?  Can my husband reach out to the attorneys she's hired to handle  it?   Can/should he reach out to the Court system?   We realize at this  very moment, there may be issues with the courts due to Covid-19, but  my husband and his brother are starting to get a little nervous given  her history.

TL;DR:  My sister in law spent over 100k of my f-i-l's money pre-2012 and  POA/Access to his finances was removed by the courts.  She is now the  executor of his estate (140k in cash/funds, no physical property) and  has still not distributed funds since he death in early Sept 2019.

A little back story I'm 23 and a big car enthusiast hoping to be a car restorer one day and I've been looking at trying to get a classic Volkswagen beetle since I was 15 and I looked at purchasing 8 before I found the one I bought, it's a 1972 Volkswagen superbeetle for those interested, it's not in great shape definitely needs restored but it's a really solid start and is (was) great mechanically. Well I drove it for about 8k miles with little to no issues or fixing them myself well after it being down for a week due to needing the air filter cleaned I got it running again and drove it to get gas when I got there and it left a puddle of transmission fluid under it, so I trailed it home and it sat for about 2 months till I found a shop that works on classic cars to repair it. I purchased a gasket set and axle seals for it and they had it for 3months and 3 weeks (much longer than they said they would by 3 months) well after I got it back with them charging almost $240 more than they initially quoted I went to get it and drive it home and it needed gas so I went to the gas station and almost immediately it wasn't acting right, 1st gear made the whole car shudder, 2nd gear had severe power loss and barely held, 4 wined so loud over 50 you couldn't speak to the person next to you, and reverse would grab and stop the car after about 3 feet, obviously it didn't do anything like this the 8k before hand and all I wanted was the gaskets replaced so I didn't have to worry about it now I'm still left with an undrivable car $540 out of pocket and I don't know what to do from here. The shop said to bring it by so they can check it and see if they can sort it out but I dont want to have to pay more for their screw up and I dont want it to be up there for 3 more months while they check it out. At this point what should I do , should I let the shop fix it and hope they treat me right without charging more? Should I take it somewhere else and get it checked and send them the bill? Should i take them to court? If so which court, small claims? Do I need a lawyer?

I am looking for legal advice regarding dog ownership. I would like to get an idea of what I should be doing. Basic summary is that me and my girlfriend raised a dog together for 1 year as a puppy. 2 weeks ago we broke up and i kind of walked away from the relationship. yesterday i told her in a text to not give away the dog (she was threatening to do so) that has been staying at her house only to find out that she has given it away very quickly after i left the house. Furthermore, she will not give me any details regarding whom she gave the dog away to.

The details are:

1) I have proof of purchase of the dog

2) She has veterinarian records and the records are in her name (because I work during the week and she takes him to the vet that time)

3) I have dog food, dog toys, etc purchase history that time

4) The dog grew up 80% at her house that year, 20% at a friend of my own since we were both unavailable at a period of time.

How would I best be able to proceed? She has blocked my messages in trying to reach her and to talk to her about having given away the dog and she has threatened to call the police if i dare set foot anywhere near her home.

51,NY Rental Question - I am the tenant and landlord is raising rent 17% with 20 day notice,1589207036,"I'm in upstate NY (so not NYC which maybe has different laws). Sorry it became longer than I thought but I wanted to jot down dates and convos. TLDR is they want to give me 2-3 weeks notice with raising my rent for a new lease. I'm wondering what actions I can take or say to my landlord to give me a month or two to be able to have a new place to live in a month or two during Covid-19.  


I've been renting my current apartment in a large house/building that has been converted to nine units since June 2014. My lease is from June to May so May 31st my lease is up.  


My lease agreement states I need to provide the landlord 60 days notice if I plan on NOT renewing my lease. I had full intention to renew as I did not receive any rent increase notification. My landlords are a husband and wife team that own a few buildings similar to mine in my city and I've never had any issues with them what-so-ever and I even rather liked them as landlords.  


I currently pay $1400 per month.  


I received a hand delivered letter on May 1st saying my rent would be increased to $1,450 signed by the wife and they asked for my response as soon as possible as we're now within that 60-day window I mentioned above. On the 6th I responded asking if we could chat - they live on the same street so the husband walked over.  


Before I could mention that we were going to accept, he started mentioning that he's sorry but he's going to need to raise the rent to $1,700 at first. But throughout this conversation he also mentioned $1,650. After I bit I mentioned that I already receive a dated letter saying $1,450 from his wife. He turned visibly red and silent for a few moments and then said he will get back to me in a day or two and said that I should consider that letter garbage and use it as toilet paper.  


Saturday the 9th I still haven't heard back or receive a new notice of rental increase so I called him. He did not want to talk in person this time around and was very abusive on the phone - I had said we can't do the $1,650 he verbally said so if he could give us another month or two so we can find a new apartment to move to. He said absolutely not and will be enjoying watching me packing my belongings this week. I said that I don't even think a $250 is allowed with 2 or 3 weeks notice and asked if could have that in writing. That REALLY set him off and I've never heard him scream and yell before - saying how he thinks I'm going to get a lawyer so he'll have to get one and we'll be seeing each other in court. I don't even have a lawyer so I chuckled at that. He got so angry he hung up after screaming some more.  


So I texted the wife saying her husband is really upset with me. I texted her saying our minimum goal is to have a month or two (lease ends at end of May so have June and July) to look for a new apartment. She responded a few hours later that they would keep us at $1,400 for June, but then a new lease would be required for July through June 2021 at $1,600 per month.  


I was happy to have at least June to look for a new apartment. However, that text was short lived - the next morning - so yesterday the 10th - the husband called my own wife and was trying to get her to walk over to his place to discuss the new lease - citing numbers of $1,700, $1,650, and $1,600. Unbeknownst to both landlords, wife is recovering from a cancer surgery treatment she had two weeks ago - she's unable to walk - so she told the husband landlord on the phone she'll just have me walk over and that really angered the landlord again and he started to belittle her to the point she was in tears and had to say the reason she couldn't come was because of her cancer. This is when I heard her crying upstairs and with the landlord still on her phone she told me what was happening - I immediately grabbed the phone and told the landlord to F-off and asked what the F he was doing and told him to never F'in communicate with us again unless it's by letter.  


The landlords dropped off a new letter saying to disregard all previous quotes and that we can have June for $1,500 (so $100 or \~7% more than our previous $1,400) and then we can discuss a 10 month lease from July to April 2021.  


My question is, can I ignore the letter and just give them a $1,400 check for June as was mentioned in the text? What if they try to evict or have our cars towed from parking for trespass?

60,Employer Reported Incorrect Hours Worked Affecting My Unemployment (AL),1589206220,"My employer has had reduced hours due to coronavirus. I have been reporting my reduced hours to collect unemployment. The way this reporting works is that I report my gross earnings for the week previous to a government website, and they take that report and decide whether or not to send me an unemployment check if I haven't met a certain minimum amount. I have been doing my diligence to report my earnings until I ran into a problem during this last paycheck

My employer reported that I worked 60 more hours than my actual worked hours without telling me over the past two weeks. This obviously gave me way more earnings but more importantly looked like I was falsely reporting my earnings to collect unemployment.

63,I was pushed down a flight of stairs...twice. He was not allowed into the building and he was carrying my girlfriends 5 year old son in his arms. (NYC),1589206150,"I am the mothers boyfriend. He has a history of abuse, violence and physically threatening her. For obvious reasons, she fears her ex who is the biological father. 

The boys mother has custody of the boy, and the father has visitation. The order does not specify who will pick up the child. But the child will be dropped off by the curb of his address. The ex had no reason to say anything to me for the last several months that I did the pick up and dropping off until three days ago. He apparently didn't like ""the way I talked"" to the boy. 

So he waited for me in the lobby of the apartment building, unannounced and uninvited by any residents there until I came out. That is when he verbally harassed me and then physically threatened me first. I'll admit, I was furious that he did such a thing and I told him to fuck off several times and never to come into the building. 

The second time was during his visitation in the weekend. I dropped off the boy to him, no problem. When it was time to get him back, he would not release the child from his car, saying I did not have the right to pick up the boy for his mother. That's when I called the police, he was in violation of his court order and he kept the child over the time he was allowed. After about an hour on the curb, the police still hadn't arrived. So he took the boy and walked to the building.

I was in front of this apartment building and I told him to hand off the child to me. The mother is afraid of what he might do if she let the door open to him. I told him that he may not enter the building, thats when he pushed past me with the boy in his arm. I was afraid of him going up the stairs so I ran up first and told him to leave him with me again and stay outside. He shoved me down the stairs. At this point I was afraid of what might happen if he got to the door so I got in front of him again and told him to give me the boy. I tumble down and bang up my joints on the way down but I'm largely OK, just bruised.

NYPD arrives and tells me this is only harassment that I can file against him.

Have looked at how to change a name, but wondering if anyone can give any further legal advice please.

67,Question Regarding property damages and physical attacks,1589206057,"Alright people of legaladvice, I have some questions because a lot of times on Reddit I see people saying that if someone breaks your stuff (even family) you're liable to sue them. My question is, does this apply to other countries like Spain, Italy or even Germany? If an uncle, a parent, or a friend were to destroy/smash/throw your property and cause damage to it, would you actually be liable to sue for damages and, if you could, how much would that be worthy to do (or if there're any consequences of doing so)?

Another question is the ones I see about family members hitting their children, which can be young or adult whatever it is. How does this work in other states, do the police just don't care and say ""your parents probably had a reason to hurt you"" or would they actually file a complete report of the situation?

69,My neighbor stole my things and I don't know how to proceed,1589205620,"I'm sorry for the length. So last weekend I (23f) was at my boyfriend's house and my mom invited my neighbor (30ish/f) and her daughter (3) over for a sleepover. We live in a duplex, so our walls are connected. They decided to all stay in my room because I have 2 couches and a bunch of streaming services (which is fine by me).

Now sometime in the middle of the night, my mom left my room and came back about 15/20 minutes later and everything was fine. Side note, my brother and his girlfriend were in the house just a floor below. 

I came home a day later and the first things I noticed that were missing were my phone charger and fire stick remote. In place of my phone charger was a USB C cable and my phone doesn't charge to that. I figured my brother or mom took the charger and misplaced the remote so I tore my room apart and didn't find anything and my mom and brother didn't have either thing. A toddler has a ton of shit, so my mom decided to ask the neighbor if it ended up in an overnight bag or something and she did have it and it was returned. The charger was not.

I keep my stuff organized, so when I went into my nail polish basket it was covered with all kinds of polish and some were missing...

Then I look for my ring my boyfriend gave my 2 years ago and that is missing from the ring holder it was on. When I brought this up to my mom, she was livid. She knew exactly where I had left it and it wasn't there, but I tore my room apart again to see if it was misplaced...it wasn't. My mom had also asked if I lost an earring because she found it on the ground in my room. It was my earring, but I hadn't worn them and I make sure my earrings are connected when they aren't being worn. I go through my jewelry box and the other one is missing and few a others are too.

I know it was my neighbor and my mother sent her a text telling her to return everything, but she hasn't gotten back. I'm angry. I feel violated that someone could do this.

I have tried putting predator pee around the garden, keeping the beds wet in the evening, covering gaps leading into the garden (a lot of them just climb the fence). The only effective method I have found has been catching them in the act and chasing them off, which I obviously can't keep constant watch over my beds forever.

83,Buying a house privately that has no MLS listing while still under contract with a realtor. Will I still have to pay fees?,1589204129,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

A while ago I signed a contract with a realtor (mistake) while looking for houses. I was close to buying a house when it fell through because there was a ton of unseen mold in the house that the seller wouldn't remove before buying. 

This contract expires on 8/15/2020. 

A family friend is selling their house and have not yet put it on the market.  They want to sell it to me and in order for us all to get a good deal, they do not want to use a realtor. 

The sellers are telling me that since it has no MLS listing, I will be fine. My realtor legally cannot charge any fees. However I am skeptical. Below is the text of the agreement with the realtor.

&amp;#x200B;

"" 1. Effect of Exclusive Buyer Agency Contract. By appointing Broker as Buyer's exclusive agent, Buyer agrees to conduct all negotiations for Property through Broker, and to refer to Broker all inquiries received from real estate brokers, salesperson's prospective sellers, or any other source during the time this contract is in effect. Buyer understands and agrees that the commission payable by Buyer to Broker under paragraph 4 of this contract shall be deemed earned by Broker and payable upon Buyer's purchase of real estate whether or not Broker was involved in the transaction leading to such purchase. For example, if you purchase a property on your own without Broker's assistance (such as through an open house or “For Sale By Owner”), you would nonetheless owe Broker the commission described under paragraph 4 in consideration for Broker's commitment and efforts in assisting you in attempting to acquire real estate. 

2. Duration of Agency. Broker's authority shall begin upon signing this contract and shall continue for 365 days from the date above, or completion of settlement of property under an agreement signed before then. 

3. Brokers Representations and Services. Broker will utilize his/her professional knowledge to make a good faith effort to locate real property as described by the Buyer. Broker will assist Buyer throughout the transaction and will act at all times in the Buyer's interest. Buyer will Furnish Broker with necessary personal and financial information to assist Buyer's efforts to purchase property. 

4. Administrative Fee: A $295 administrative fee is payable by the buyer at settlement for processing the agreement of sale and closing coordination. ""

&amp;#x200B;

So if I bought the house that has no MLS listing,  would I still owe something to the realtor? The realtor wasn't bad, it was just a bad time for me to try to buy a house.

90,"Unemployment, Voluntary Furlough, and Refusing to Return to Work",1589203334,"Hi, everyone. As you can tell from the title, this is a question about unemployment and refusing  to go back to work. But I think my situation has a twist, so I'm not sure how it's going to go.

In March, my employer, a hotel managed by a company that has over 500 employees but less than 100 at my particular site, was doing mass furloughs due to the decline in business. My job was not needed, but I can work other placed in the hotel so they offered to let me stay and work those if I didn't want to be furloughed. I stayed for a few days, but then asked if the offer was still up. You see, I have psoriatic arthritis and take medicine that has the nice side-effect of suppressing my immune system. I was scared (and still am) of catching COVID since my job is so people-centric. So, I asked to be furloughed if they didn't need me. They said yes. I was furloughed and have been collecting unemployment since. I may also add that this was before the CARES Act was passed, so I thought I would only get regular Ohio unemployment. This was not about money.

My questions now is this: When I am asked to return to work (they haven't yet, but it's only a matter of time) if I refuse, what will happen? I know I will most likely not be elligible for unemployment anymore since, in Ohio, pre-existing conditions are not a valid reason not to return to work. But here's the big one I've been wondering about: Can I be told that I have to pay back any unemployment that I received already? Does having somewhat 'volunteered' for furlough mean that I have to pay everything back?

I don't know what I'll do, because I almost don't know what I can do. I hate feeling scared of my own job, but I am. To top off my risk with a pre-exisitng condition, I live with both of my parents who are over 65 and one of whom has a suppressed immune system as well. I'm worried. Does anyone with knowledge about this type of thing have any advice?

January this year I applied for a credit card and said I still worked for my previous employer, not realising how very bad this decision was.

I've used the card a lot over the past few months but have always paid the balance off in quick time. However, I recently recieved an email and letter saying my account was under financial review and would need to provide documentation/bank statements.

Like the idiot I am, I replied with my bank statements, which is basically handing them proof I lied on my application. I forgot I had lied and thought things could go smoothly, as I had actually been paying the balance off. I realise now what a mistake I've made. 

Since replying to the email, I have cancelled my card and paid the balance. But I don't think the account itself is gone.

95,Leaving tiny company- Owner wants revenge,1589203127,"This will be a bizarre one for you all. I work in the cannabis industry for a small distributor. Cannabis use is very rampant and some of my coworkers used to be criminals. It’s a bizarre workplace where a lot of managers do not have the common experience(education, training) required for someone in their role. As a result, the majority of managers are extremely loyal to the owner. One manager in particular quit, couldn’t find another job nearly as good and returned. 

Two fridays ago I put in my two weeks as I am going back to school for a career change. The owner called me a short leave fucker late last week. Due to excessive cannabis use and the life changes happening(about to move cross country) I have become very anxious. 

The owner has been forth coming about he was disappointed in me leaving. He normally get shitty with people when they leave and it’s very rare at my organization. He has called me a loser amoung other things.

The real point of this post is that the owner recently hired one of the investor whose heavily involved in the business’s daughter as an hr consultant. She started interviewing ladies around my office. This is extremely unusual. Given the weird lotalty structure, the extremely close relationship between the hr consultant and the owner. I feel this may be his revenge for me leaving before finishing some of the projects I promised. He seems to be very pissed at me recently so I wouldn’t put it past him to make some bullshit story up about sexual harassment or hostile workplace.

Any advice? My current plan is to put in an immediate resignation if they try to get me to sign anything, talk on the record, etc. I didn’t do anything wrong.

I would put something like

I hereby resign effective immediately. I found the proceedings of today to be rediculous as last week you called me a short leave fucker.

99,[CA] Employer wants me to use paid time off if I work second job on my own time,1589202749,"I am a salaried full-time FLSA-exempt professional employee of Company X, a mid-sized government contractor. I'm located in California. Company X's corporate headquarters are in Virginia. A friend of mine is starting a business, Company Y. A previous job has given me experience relevant to Company Y. My friend trusts me and would like a little help. He proposed that I work for him as a consultant for between a half hour and an hour per week, providing advice via phone, Zoom, and e-mail.

I like Company X. They are usually reasonable, and I'm not interested in leaving. I told my boss I wanted to consult for Company Y and asked him if Company X would object. He had a conversation with Company X's lawyer and relayed the conclusions to me. Most of what he said was unsurprising; but one thing seems crazy.

Company X's lawyer said there were four things they would require of me. (I think he forgot to tell me not to use Company X's resources while consulting for Company Y, but I already knew not to do that.) The first two I expected, and the third one I might have expected. It's the fourth one that I'm concerned about:

1. Company Y's business is different enough from Company X's that Company X is not concerned about a conflict of interest. I'll be asked to sign a form declaring my relationship with Company Y. If Company Y ever initiates a relationship with the agencies that Company X works for, then Company X will require me to immediately terminate my relationship with Company Y.
2. Company X reminds me that I have information that cannot be shared with Company Y, including both Company X's proprietary information and information from Company X's client agencies.
3. While Company X encourages employees such as myself to use a flexible schedule as needed, we nevertheless have documented work days. Company X asserts that, because it bills hourly and is therefore ultimately selling my time, it possesses my time during my documented work day. Because of this, I am forbidden from giving my time to another employer during my documented work day. Consequently I am not allowed to consult for Company Y during my documented work day. Specifically: (a) I am not allowed to take paid time off from Company X during my documented work day and consult for Company Y during that time; (b) I am not allowed to use Company X's flexible scheduling policy to meet my obligations to Company X outside of my documented work day and then work for Company Y on my own time during my documented work day with Company X. (However, I am allowed to change my documented work day or become a part-time employee, subject to the same management approval as anyone else.)
4. Company X further asserts that, because it has purchased my professional skills, I am not allowed to work for Company Y, even on my own time and outside of my documented work day, unless I take PTO from Company X. For example, if I wanted to consult for Company Y for one hour on Saturday morning (which is outside my usual working hours), then Company X would require that I take one hour of PTO during my regular working hours for the same pay period, for example, Friday afternoon. During that hour of PTO on Friday afternoon, I would not be allowed to work for Company Y (in accordance with the previous paragraph).

I thought, and still think, that this last assertion is crazy. I asked what would happen if I had a side business that didn't use my professional skills, like selling crafts on Etsy? Would I be required to take an hour of PTO from Company X for every hour I spent on a hypothetical Etsy business? The response I got from my boss was non-committal but suggested that the same rule might apply.

It does not feel fair for Company X to require me to use PTO for an activity done on my own time. It seems to contradict the idea of ""time off"", particularly when they've already conceded that the activity is permitted. But law is complicated, and sometimes unfair things are legal. Can Company X require that, for every hour of my own time outside of regular working hours that I spend consulting for Company Y, I take an equal amount of PTO?

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance and I have had a lot of tough times. When he starts a fight -- he will NOT lose. I can't escape the argument and ask for time or a walk etc. He will tell me if I don't talk to him THEN -- he will be done with me forever. It's his controlling way.

Anyway, he's had a habit recently of telling me he has been recording our fights via his home security camera (that he hasn't given me access to). And he says he has a HUGE journal of all his problems with me and his pictures. (He's never shown me this).

The other night we had a horrible fight because he told me he wouldn't put me on his (our) apartment lease and if I was on it ..he would move out. he said he would never allow me to be equal with him on the lease. (I have my own lease and he refused to be on that too -- ) He's said he wants nothing legally connected.

(However, his apartment listed me as a roommate and ran my background check).

Anyway -- when he told me this and the venom came through...I broke down. I started drinking. I got a bottle of wine. I hadn't eaten all day and it went to my head. He came in the door screaming to talk to me. I had the bathroom door locked and told him I would be right out. He did his typical and said if I didn't come out right then and respect him -- he would eave me for good. So I stayed quiet. I went absolutely silent. Honestly I was also drunk and just hung out in the closet.

He went and got a drill and drilled through my door and opened it. He also was on the phone with his parents (he's 59 and they are in their 80s) complaining about me and saying he thought I killed myself (I WOULD NEVER AND HAVE NEVER THREATENED THAT!)

When he came in -- he was rolling his video camera on me and started shaking me and looking at my eyes. He was RECORDING ME! He said he needs to document because he doesn't want to be accused of my murder.

So things are calm now...but not forgotten. He says over and over that he has extensive video footage of me from our arguments, journals and photos of me when I pass out for the night.  Basically, if I have a few glasses of wine and sit on the couch and fall asleep watching TV -- he says he documents that and takes pictures so he can have ""just in case"".

My wife is a Japanese citizen if that’s of any help and she’s 29 turns 30 this coming July. She went to Australia back in July 2014-2015 on a holiday working visa. She did 2 months of WWOOFing (no payslip) and 1 month of fruit picking (has pay slips) 

We know the Australian Government changed its laws on the 31st of August 2015 and no longer allow WWOOF as a specified job anymore. 

So what about the people who did WWOOFing and had the chance to apply for a second holiday visa before this change date happened? Can she still apply for a second visa? 

Also, is it possible to enter Australia on a tourist visa and then apply/switch to a second-holiday visa/working visa?

11,Got a call from the police that my NFamily is trying to track me down,1589201051,"On Saturday night I got a call from my local police since apparantly my brother had called them, saying that he hasn't spoken to me in over a year and that he's worried about me. The operator had asked him why he waited a year then, to which he couldn't answer. 

I've been estranged from my entire family since August 2018. I live in a different city to them (an hour away).

Here's the issue;
When I was 17, I became homeless because my mother had tried to honour kill me since I was too 'western' (extremist Muslim family). She choked me and I barely got away with my life. I locked myself in the toilet and my brother body slammed the door until it broke off the frame. While I was in there I called the police, they never came and I remained in the toilet until the next day when I took my phone and charger and went to the station. This happened in 2014. I ended up not being able to find anywhere to stay because I was an EU citizen in the UK and I had no rights, so I had to go back to living with my family. Or so I believed. 

I ended up asking to drop the case since I had no where to go and the family I was staying with told me I was wrong and I shouldn't do that to my mother and that I'll go to hell (also a Muslim family). I ended up moving back in with my crazy family but they never tried to kill me again. 

I'm 24 now, have been no contact since August 2018 and they're trying to find me again, probably to finish their unfinished business. I don't feel safe. The police don't seem to be taking this seriously. What can I do?

I've been living in fear ever since I went no contact, I've avoided any Muslim communities/any Arabic speakers and pretend like I don't understand it when I hear it anywhere around me. 

I've been completely isolated from society ever since I went no contact. I don't trust anyone. I've been suffering with sever depression and anxiety, yet again I've not been offered any professional therapy, I had some talk therapy when I went to the GP. It didn't help much, they said I as better and the therapy stopped. 

I've been living with housemates this entire time, I've already moved twice but remained in the same city. My siblings are 39F, 38M and 34F. They all still live with my mother, none of them are married or have much of a career going since they're trapped by her (she won't allow it). I'm the only one that escaped. And now they're coming for me. 

I fear for my life. What can I do? Where do I go? I have no support network and yet again have been living in fear my entire life. They've been abusive my entire life. I just never known any better since I was a child. 

How do I protect myself from this? I have thought of changing my name as well as moving, I'm just worried about funds. I dropped out of uni because of their issues as well, also because of depression and anxiety.

20,(IL) Squirrels everywhere,1589199414,"I’ve seen similar posts but not where I’m from or my specific issue. 

I’m renting in Illinois, and our apartment is an old house that has been subdivided. We have the half of the second floor and the entirety of the finished attic. About two weeks after move in, we realized that there are squirrels in the walls and in the small unfinished spaces above the ceiling etc. we informed the landlord and were met with skepticism. 

I’ve been on the landlord and he was sending somebody out beginning of March when the IL stay at home order started for COVID. Whoever he had coming out fell through. He continued to keep making excuses that he couldn’t find anybody to come out, but that he was trying. At one point he got his handyman (buddy of his who does small maintenance for the property) to come look at the hole the squirrels are using for access. Their solution was that they should board it up. When I mentioned that then the squirrels would be trapped, he mentioned getting some traps.  

Nothing for another few weeks, with us noticing the sounds of babies in the ceiling. Informed him of that and received another response about looking for somebody to come out. 

Fast forward to last week, landlord tells us with less than an hours notice on a Saturday morning that a gentleman will be out to look into it. I’m not even mad about the notice because I want the rodents gone, but still, we have animals and things that have to be prepped before a stranger comes in, and that’s not even considering COVID things. 

Guy shows up and looks at most of the access places but doesn’t have a tall enough ladder for the exterior spots and one of interior portions. Comes back on Monday to look again and get up on the ladder. 

After he’s done looking, he informs me of all of the nesting and droppings and damage (not surprising, you can hear them chewing and chattering at each other). He tells me that there’s no way he can just board up the holes, as that’s what he was hired to give an estimate on.   After discussing with him about how we’ve been telling landlord that full removal and cleaning is needed, he agreed and said he would inform landlord of the same. 

Haven’t heard from landlord about it, waiting for Monday for a full week to pass and give him a chance to do things. 

My girlfriend and I absolutely love this apartment, it’s a great setup and there’s no fees/rent for our pets. Almost all utilities are included. We just need the squirrels gone. But we also realize that with the setup of the apartment (lots of narrow and angled walls where the wall is finished against the roof, and there’s no way a person could get in there to clean without ripping out the wall) means we’re going to have to move out/hotel/something during remediation.

21,A confliction between two contracts has left my girlfriend without a job.,1589199375,"Hello!

A little backstory first. My girlfriend has worked in a café that is a part of a larger chain for a few years. Last year she began studying, and had to quit her job because of it. She was later asked to come back, and they were able to offer her a part time job with 20% (I don't know if this is a common term, or just one in our country). The problem is that the chain doesn't usually offer that little work, and she therefore signed a contract for 40% with a verbal agreement that she would only work 20%. She has a confirmation of this on mail.

The chain has been hit quite bad by the covid-19 crisis. Today she was called be the chain's administration, telling her that she would have to work 40%, despite the agreement for 20%, or she would have to quit. It's not possible for her to work that much, and her only option is therefore to quit the job.

Is it correct that the the agreement to only work 20% is void, since the contract states 40%, or is the agreement legally binding for the chain, meaning that they cannot require her to work the full amount?

22,Lumping company my job uses seems a bit shady. [MA],1589199279,"Hi all, hopefully I’m using the right flair, and I’m in the right place. 

Quick background: I work as a receiver at a Massachusetts warehouse for seafood products. Because of that, I work closely with employees from a lumping service contracted by job, instructing them on how we want our pallets of products built.

One of the employees I’m friendly with, Kyle, is soon to be a father and, through talking more with him, he’s told me he doesn’t get any sick or vacation time. I thought it was odd, but not too unusual because I know the labor business can be kind of cutthroat. He also told me that he wants to take time off to be with his family but they keep harassing him to go to work. Again, not odd. 

What brought me here is that he told me that if he were to try to go on unemployment, his direct supervisor let him know the owners of the lumping company can contest his claim, just by saying he is refusing work.

I’m not too sure what’s going on there, but I did tell him I’d look into it because I honestly don’t know much about that kind of stuff. He hasn’t been working with them for a year yet, but wouldn’t sick time still be available if it was accrued? And under which circumstances can an employer contest a former employees unemployment claims, if said employee was fired because they weren’t offered PTO?

24,"Non-profit company denied letting me apply to rescue a dog because they assumed I was disabled. I am not. They then repeatedly insulted the disabled, mentally ill, and chronically ill communities, and then changed their policy and pet adoption requirements to specifically exclude the disabled.",1589198208,"I live in Virginia, and on May 5th I messaged a non-profit herding dog rescue in my area showing interest in a particular dog. The rescue asked that people message them first before submitting an application. I did just that. They posted a list of requirements for the dog. Myself and my husband met every single requirement, and then some. We have two healthy and happy herding dogs already, and are very familiar with the needs of the breed.

While waiting for a reply from the rescue, I commented on the rescues facebook post and spoke briefly to the foster mother of the dog. In my comment I mentioned that I have ""health issues"", which is part of the reason why I am home 24/7. Someone being home with the dog 24/7 was one of the requirements listed. My health issues in no way impede my ability to care for a dog and I had stated as such.

Because of this one comment with the phrase ""health issues"", the rescue assumed that I was disabled and refused to allow me to even fill out an application specifically because of my assumed disability. They knew, and know, absolutely nothing about my health. They never even bothered to ask any questions about my health or situation before denying me the application. I never stated that I was disabled. Not once, not ever. Again, I am not disabled. They assumed that.

I then posted a review of my experience on their facebook page. Stating facts only, and posting the screenshot of our one conversation, and the comment to the foster mother as proof. 

After their denial of allowing me to put in an application, they changed their requirements on the post of the dog specifically to exclude disabled people. I still met every single requirement, and was still not allowed to even fill out an application because of their incorrect assumption that I have a disability. I have denied having a disability at every turn. 

After the rescue changed the post to exclude the disabled, people started posting screenshots of the rescues policy that originally stated ""As a matter of policy, (rescue) does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, national or ethnic origin, or physical disability."" They then went on to change their website policy specifically to exclude disabled people.

Once the review I posted gained some views, people started calling them out for being discriminatory. The rescue then claimed that I, myself, was ""bullying"" them to try to get the dog and tried to discredit me and my review. One of their exact quotes was ""this review is just a clear attempt to bully us into giving a dog to a family who does not meet the minimum requirements."" Again, I met all listed requirements, they know absolutely nothing about me, my household, or my health, and I was refused even being allowed to apply.

The owner of the rescue, as well as few of their current/former volunteer/employees resorted to personal attacks, calling me a liar, calling me names, and even going so far to insult me and say they denied me because of how I look. (My profile picture has a snapchat filter with black lipstick on it.) One person who at one point adopted from them, said they had ""been on the admin side of the facebook page and saw the original transcript"" and said that I was lying to try to get a rise out of people. They made claims ""the real reason"" I was denied is that ""the dog was too high strung"" for me, even though they know nothing about me or my health issues, and I was never even allowed to submit an application. She claimed to have screenshots that prove that I lied, but refused to post her supposed 'proof'. It still has not surfaced. It does not exist. They are still trying to discredit my review.

The rescue then went on to start insulting commenters. One said, and I quote, ""Disabilities are not always physical many of these people seem to have mental disabilities and we should pray for them not try and reason with them."" 

Hundreds of people have commented and the rescue has been deleting every comment that criticizes their behavior, blocking anyone who says anything about the situation, and deleting and turning off reviews. Luckily I have screenshots of every single thing they have done and said. Timestamped, dated, all of it. 

This is no longer about me trying to rescue a dog. I understand that I am never going to get this dog. That is not the point anymore. The actions of this rescue towards the disabled, mentally ill, and chronically ill communities are deplorable, and they have shown no remorse. They have made no attempt to apologize for their statements, nor their treatment of the disabled, mentally ill, and chronically ill communities. At every turn, they have doubled down and made even more discriminatory remarks, and repeatedly changed their policies specifically to exclude said groups.

I have been advised to report them to the ADA. Can I report them for this discrimination against disabled people even though I, myself, am not disabled? What additional measures can I take to ensure that this never happens again? Are there other agencies or groups I can report them to? Is there anything I should know about reporting and dealing with a non-profit compared to a regular company? I am willing to provide the screenshots if anyone needs more clarification or proof.

25,Rent,1589197111,"This is a little long because it has been a six month headache. I should mention, both parties have been completely cordial with each other the entire time. It just needs to be resolved. 

My wife and I live in an apartment in Nashville, TN and have been living in this same complex for about a year and a half. We were able to pay our rent during the first year like normal, no problem. We do so from an online portal where you can pay rent just as you would any other bill online. The first year, rent was around ~$1500.

When the lease expired, we didn’t get any correspondence from them about either renewing the lease or giving notice of leaving. This made our rent go to a month-to-month rate, as well as raise our rent by an additional few hundred going forward. This made our rent for January of this year at $2200. So of course, we reach out to the leasing office to figure out the problem. Either we messed up, or they did, and we all eventually agreed that it was a wash and that we’ll just sign another lease and they’ll forgive the excess amount for that month. I was grateful and I thought that was the end of it. 

When it came to signing the new lease, we were given this message: “We offer you a $1000 lease credit and the following lease terms:” 
To which was listed, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. We had in writing that it said $1000 lease credit for January’s rent, regardless of what length of term that we chose.

My wife and I are recently married so we had been dreaming of owning our first home together. We thought that the six month option would be perfect and we could potentially be moving into a house come July. Due to it being a shorter lease term, the rent was a couple hundred dollars more than the entire year lease. This was then around $1700. So according to the terms of our agreement, January’s rent should have been $700, and then February would start the $1700 rent and we would pay as normal. 
Ok, so we think we have this new lease and life is all dandy. Then, January rent comes due and we were only given a $500 credit. This was a problem as we had planned and budgeted with the assumption that we were being given a $1000 credit. We reached out and called and emailed a few separate times, having to chase our leasing agent down in person, just to get a response. 
She then explained to us at that time, the 6 month term meant only a $500 lease credit. It said this no where on what she sent us. We should be receiving $1000 regardless based on her email. She agreed and explained to us that she screwed up and she should have never offered us that. Her boss would be really angry with her if they found out she did that. (Hence the not returning my calls/emails part.) I understand that situation, but, that’s not my problem in terms of my own personal situation. 
So apparently, she never submitted our new lease to corporate so it wasn’t legally binding yet. This was how she was going to switch the lease to a 12-month lease in order to give the $1000 credit. But we still wanted out in 6 months, so we agreed on a stipulation that we would agree to allow potential new renters to view/take over our apartment in July. 
So verbally over the phone, she tells us about the new stipulation and we agree on that over the phone. She told us that it would bring our rent to just a little over $1500, so we would be back to around our previous year’s rent. We thought that was great and that everyone was happy. 

Then February comes around and our rent says: “$78.00” Well that’s weird, so of course I call again. 
Doesn’t answer and never calls back. Sent emails, called, left messages. Never returned. My wife found her in person to confront her again. Now mind you, we’re not very confrontational people. We never imply that it’s her fault. We simply just explain the issue and what resolution that we’re looking for. This time being, go into the system and fix the amount to the proper amount, please. She says that she’ll do it ASAP. The next day, it’s still $78. My wife calls again, and she finally (to what we thought) fixed the amount. She had changed the rent to $1550.00 on our portal. With water bill and pest control, this would be about what a monthly payment would be. So we paid it and thought, okay, finally, we’re all good to go from here on out. 

March rolls around (Pre-Coronavirus) and the rent portal says “$38.00” so again, she did not permanently fix the problem. We emailed several times and called several times. She ignored every message and never returned any phone call. This was starting to be really frustrating and it has now evolved into way more than a simple mistake in the beginning... At this time, I just paid 38.00 since that’s all that I had the option for. And I even sent another email, explaining that I had only paid $38.00. Again, no response. So I said fine, the ball is in her court and there’s no way I did anything wrong. I have all the emails, phone logs, and texts as proof that I did every possible thing in my power, without involving her boss, to attempt to resolve this situation. Multiple times. 

Ok so mid-March, the Coronavirus is now a global pandemic and I’m left unemployed. (I’m a full time musician so obviously large gathering events are not going to happen for a really long time, especially at this point.) My wife was still working so we weren’t panicking yet. I sent a nice message to the leasing agent, reminding her of the situation and that we weren’t upset or angry. We just wanted it resolved right now so we don’t have to worry about whatever financial problems that the pandemic might cause us. We were frightened that this would still be raging when that 6 month lease came up and we would be forced into finding a new apartment in the midst of the pandemic, all while I had no personal source of income coming in for the foreseeable future. Or worse, what if we ended up evicted for being unable to pay in general in the near future? (That was assuming it would be fixed...) The irony is, we didn’t even HAVE to pay because it apparently didn’t matter. We could have not paid anything and skated through this whole thing without anyone batting an eye at us. 
She doesn’t reply to that email either. I called the office and she actually picks up. I tell her again, I sent you countless emails. She said that she just saw my email and was planning on calling me that afternoon. (Yeah, okay...) At this time, I ask if it’s possible that we can remove the 6 month stipulation since we don’t know what the world will look like in June so we would really like to stay. She says they would love if we stayed and that was no problem. Okay cool, so we’re back to being here until December 2020.
Turns out, the lease that we signed, didn’t have any amount on it. So neither of us even know the actual amount that our rent is. We knew it was around $1500ish but she never even submitted the paperwork. The reason it kept saying $78 and $38 dollars is because the lease she sent had a big blank line on what we owe monthly. We signed a lease that said we don’t owe anything, it seems like. And she never signed her half and never submitted it. I explain this again. 
So over the phone, she tells us that she’s going to send a paper copy of our new lease to our door. She sends someone with the lease who doesn’t know any of the situation so he didn’t answer any questions we had. This paper copy lease STILL had no amount on it. I tell her that, she doesn’t do anything about it. So we signed it (that was probably dumb but we don’t even know what is what anymore.) We found out that we can pay extra on the rent portal and it just shows a negative amount. So we pay $1500 to it and it shows we have a balance of (-$1430). That’s what it looks like is that it has a credit. So we just pretty much paid a credit of $1430, which could be deducted when the rent amount is fixed. She never signed the lease. She hasn’t signed any lease other than the original one when we first moved in. (We get email verification when each individual party signs.) 

April comes around, it’s the same song and dance... but this time, we put the $1500 into a savings account.

Fast forward to about two weeks ago, for May’s rent, I again go through my whole song and dance again. Email, call, text. Ignored again. I’m assuming she gets paid and has incentives to get new residents. Apparently, existing residents don’t get her any new bonuses as she clearly just never did her job. How am I asking for something unreasonable? Take my money! She has dropped the ball several times. It’s May for crying out loud. This should have been resolved in January, maybe February at the very latest when we caught it the first time. 
So at this point, even though she made it clear that she would get in trouble if we involved anyone else, we were just fed up. So I call and speak with another staff member, explain the situation, but I framed it as if it was some big misunderstanding and that it was all good. Just fix it. He asks the leasing agent I’ve been referring to, and she acts like she has no idea why we can’t pay rent and acts as if it’s a computer problem. As if there was an issue with the online portal for why we can’t rent and not any human error. I know this to be a lie, obviously, as she has countless emails from me explaining otherwise. But as I have to live here still, I want to keep them with a positive opinion of me. So I say okay fine, please take care of it then and let me know. She says she put a support ticket in and she’ll let me know. I said okay, fine. Just like the boy who cried wolf, I knew she wasn’t going to take care of it. So I call another person in the office and explain the situation again. 
The leasing agent then texts me and asks if I know my login information for the portal. (Again, implying that it’s a computer error and that she wants to see my screen and why it won’t show up.) I gave her the login info anyway. I told her that she knew about this and it’s been a big headache for us for months. She says, “I know and I apologize for that.” She then asks for my wife’s login info, we give her that too. She says she put in a ticket and she’ll get back to us in a few days. That was April 28th. Today is May 11th. 

This has been going on since December 2019. What can I do? I have been putting the rent into a savings account because I don’t want to financially be caught in a huge problem. But at the same time, do I even have a lease that I’m legally bound to? I can’t be expected to shell out $6000 all at once due to an error that was clearly not my fault, with tons of physical proof for how I have tried to resolve this multiple times, right? I have probably about 15 emails, a call log of times, text messages. 
The leasing agent is very nice and friendly towards us and has been through this whole time. As have we. She just didn’t do her job. It’s as simple as that. She just didn’t do it. And this is 6 months later. It’s just ridiculous and we don’t know where else to turn to get this figured out. Part of me wants to just put the money into savings and not worry about it until they do, but the anxiety in me just really needs this to be resolved so it’s one last thing to worry about during this pandemic.

26,Another rent deposit question for you guys and gals,1589196946,"I worked in Oklahoma for a job. I got an apartment there for work. Shortly after I moved in this corona thing started to get serious so I quit my job and went back home. I originally was going to do 2 weeks notice on the apartment since I didn’t want to get into the next month of rent. I decided that I needed to save up some money so instead of giving work no notice (I know it’s shitty but there was other stuff going on as well) I gave them 3 weeks. So that put me 2 weeks into the next month. I originally text my landlord to let her know that I will be staying an extra 3 weeks. So that put me from leaving at the end of February to paying March’s rent and leaving around the 10th or so. I originally text her my intentions of leaving. But when I went in to pay my rent we had a full discussion of it and she took down my forwarding address. 

It is now May 11th and I still have not got my deposit. I text her on May 1st and she said she would “try to have it out by the end of day.” But I still have not seen my check. 

I am a dumbass. This is my first real rental I’ve had. I went to school in a small Midwest town so those rentals were always just verbal agreements and we didn’t expect deposits back from a party house. I didn’t take any pictures after I cleaned that place. And I fucking cleaned it. It was pretty gross when I moved in. There was what looked like a mixture of hair and spaghetti in the kitchen sink. The toilet was stained piss yellow. There was no fridge. And the stove was disgusting. 

When I left I spent an an entire day cleaning every part of that apartment. It was 10x cleaner then when I got there. 

And now let me tell you I was a great tenant. I always paid my rent on time if not early. I never made noise because I was usually too tired to do anything. I let her know about problem neighbors which she said she appreciated.

This issue is that the business I work for has changed that to 90 business days and 6 months (counted as business days). I started on Feb 11, my employer changed the agreement while we were on furlough from corona. They stated the 42 days I was on furlough does NOT count towards the 90 business days. I am essentially working 2 additional months for my raise. They also stated that the 6 month raise does not start until after the 90 days raise has been given. 

I was told by the salesmen at my job that they get paid training HOWEVER if they make a sale during hands on training, they will only make the money from the sale. They WILL NOT be paid for the training they were promised.

31,"Work wish to drastically alter our contracts (UK), what rights do we have?",1589195304,"Hello all, and thank you in advance for any support you may wish to give at this time. Throwaway account (for obvious reasons).

I work in the marketing department for a law firm in the UK. We are used to working a standard 9-5 working pattern, but with the current COVID-19 crisis we have been working remotely for the past 2 months. 

Last week, my manager's manager announced that the company are looking to change all of our contracts to accomodate new working hours, as well as cross-skills in other roles not attached to my current role (i.e. HR). The new hours would encompass the same 8-hour shift, but could be anywhere between 8am and 11pm on the day, and also includes weekend working.  My main concerns are;

* There is no mention of any compensation changes, only that we would be paid overtime for any extra hours (which we already get in our current contracts).
* We would get cross-skils training, but not in any areas I'm interested in (I was hired to produce marketing materials, I do not marticularly feel that HR skills are very marketable in my field).
* The changes are deemed 'reasonable' by management, but instigate very drastic lifestyle changes. I used to work retail with similar shifts, and got my degree to not have to do shifts like these again. I've also had to do weekend and night working on a voluntary basis, which has worked to steady our workflow after a long period of increased traffic, but these were voluntary taken up, not forced to be taken.
* If we refuse, they have suggested that they can 'give notice to terminate employment and then offer re-engagement on the new contract terms.' 

I love my job and the people I work with, and the changes seem a complete 180 from the office culture I've known over the past 18 months (they're big on mental health, working from home pre-pandemic, etc.), but it feels as though this is a lot of stick and no carrot, and comes at a time of great upheaval where it feels almost predatory, trying to force changes on us while the job market is effectively closed off.

I left my old company (15+ workers) over six months ago, while I tried to make the break go cleanly because during my time there (two years+) they had violated many consumer laws, labor laws and I also had to put up with their awful behavior (for example sexually harassing wait staff at restaurants when we took our monthly lunches, coming back to the office to find porn up on the computers etc.) so I tried to leave with as much grace as possible. The company is beginning to finally get what’s been coming for them and customers are fighting back and the reputation is going down the toilet. 

One request I had (in writing) on leaving was that they remove my name and photos from the website. Now, the reason this is is because I was the ONLY woman working for them in a male dominated job sector, think electrician that kind of gig. I don’t want to give many more details but let’s say who I am and what I did makes having me on the page as a kind of “incentive” for customers... And my boss at the time said he was going to leave my picture up for publicity and “diversity”, I then asked him to remove it and I know they keep using my name (faking emails with “signature”) with customers who solely asked for me due to my area of expertise I had while working there.

I’ve sent multiple emails asking for removal of the photos and “use of my likeness”. Is there any recourse or would it be acceptable/possible to contact a local lawyer to get something drafted up to force them to remove the photos and not use my name?

45,Should I sue my former employers for emotional distress and lack of earnings...,1589191618,"So, this is my first post, and don't know what I'm doing but happy to answer questions? I'm also all over the place with this so I'll try make it cohesive but it might be a bit of a mess. 
I worked for my former employer for 5 years. Started off as a receptionist with only 3 months experience and worked my way up to management position. However during this time the company I worked for went through many changes, terrible changes, and good changes, but by the time I was leaving I was 1 of only 3 original staff members, from GM position all the way down to maintenance and every position in between had been replaced if not once, multiple times. This is due to the fact that the place was never run correctly despite or because of the constant turnover of staff. Not sure which.
Anyway, over my time here I was constantly overworked, never paid overtime. I managed the day and night reception team and was constantly covering shifts because the team members I had were average at best and would constantly not show up, or call in sick. Despite me working a full 45 hours a week I often did up to 70 from overtime and night shifts. Its also important to note that for the role I was doing I was getting paid at least 5k less than I should have. I was also never paid extra if I did duty manager shifts (above my pay grade), or nights shifts which pay more. As well as this I was constantly helping the event department. From running food to running the whole event. Nothing they asked me was ever too much trouble. 
Outside of actually being in work I was constantly harassed with phone calls at all times of the day and night. From 4.30am calls from the gm asking me to collect candles on my way to work. (I started at 7am) . To 3am calls from maintenance to ask me for codes etc that they should know. To 7.30am calls from my team saying they can't come to work for 7am.... I never got a minute peace from the place. When I tried to make changes to my team I was told by management that I had no grounds to fire someone, but they also wouldn't let me give them warnings or anything to get the ball rolling, or to even make them aware that constantly calling in sick or not showing up was not right or good and messed the team up . I was never late with any assignment, I was one of the only managers who had all their paperwork up to date. I was constantly getting great reviews from clients. I gave my all to that company for 5 years but when I started to have trouble with anxiety and depression, they basically treated me like shit. I needed time to get my head straight and instead of helping me they ignored me. Gave me no help with my disaster of a team, I still had to do all the extra hours and continue being overworked, with them knowing that I was struggling horribly. They just didn't care. I eventually  asked for a month off, unpaid, to get my head straight and take some time. They managed to convince me in my fragile state of mind that I would be far worse off because I wouldn't be able to pay bills etc, so I stayed.
3 months go by and I have gone downhill so much that I can now not leave the house some days. I have panic attacks screaming in my hallway because outside my front door is the scariest place in the world for some reason.
One morning I got up for work, and one my way out of my apartment block I gave genuine consideration to throwing myself down the stairs so that I did not have to go to work. Sounds crazy dramatic I know but I had just reached a breaking point. None of my family or friends  recognised me has the happy outgoing person I had been all my life. This happened when I was 29. 
I told my managers about it when I got to work and told them that I was quitting. That I would no longer let them make me feel like this.
Then. They persuaded me to stay one extra week, so that my line manager could go on holiday before I left. I agreed. Like an idiot.
A week later I left and had nothing lined up work wise due to needing some time, I then struggled to find work for 3 months, and because of this I am now in massive financial difficulty. In debt and constantly paying things back that I shouldn't have to. I am in a much better place emotionally however and feel like I am almost my old self again. Still struggle with anxiety some days but I'm getting better.

Some things I remembered!
They left me in charge of the company for a weekend when we had a huge event on. What they didn't tell me is that the umbrella company over ours had pulled their Contract, so that weekend while in charge, they came in and cleared out most of our stock, and any staff that wanted to remain with the umbrella company left at that time too. The whole weekend was a huge disaster and ultimately when the new company came in on the Monday, I got the blame for it. Although they tried to pretend thats not what they thought.
GM no3 spat in my face one night after myself and my husband bumped into her in a pub. She then threatened my job if I told anyone.
The company has settled mutilple lawsuits with people that I know about. 2 being personal friends, both for wrongful termination (basically the company trying to push them out of roles they were contractually tied to, and fucked up).

Im basically wondering, what legal leg do I have to stand on.. Or do I have one. I don't think they should get away with their treatment of me. And numerous other staff members who feel the same, but only worked there for short periods of time and had the good sense to leave! 

Happy to answer questions. Sorry if this is not the right format.

Oh and here's the kicker. There is a company associated with my industry that is specifically designed to help people struggling with mental health. I did not know about it at the time and was never made aware of it after speaking with my managers about how I was struggling.

Well after a couple more exchanges she sent nude and then asked me to send one. Before I sent one I asked ""You are 19 right""? Her tinder profile said thats how old she was. Well she said ya she was 19 so I sent her a full body dick pic meaning you could see my face. Well after another message or two is shared she sends another nude without me asking and states that she is 15. She kept asking me if I was going to snitch. I said no but to stop sending me pics. I honestly knew nothing about this girl other than her ""name"" and the number she gave me. When I googled the number nothing came up and didn't want to risk going to the police. And never texted her again. I had nor ever will have any desire to sleep with a minor just to be clear. I also deleted all pics but kept text, I didnt want child porn on my phone. 

Anyways I was hoping everything was over. After I had stopped responding to her I kind of just went about my day trying to forget that morning. Well around 6pm I get a text from her ""father"" asking me to call him about this whole situation. I of course was mortified and panicky because I thought I was gonna go to jail for my fuck up. But it turns out her ""father"" was calm yet seemed very angry at the situation. He explained he his wife had caught their daughter taking her Surface Pro to make a video for me. I was confused because I had never requested a video or even mentioned it. But according to the father she wanted to impress me. Well what ever the case may be, the daughter and the mother fight and end up breaking the Surface Pro. Im sure you can see where this is going. He says he just wants this to pass and that he understands his daughter was at fault but also blamed me for not asking for a pic of her ID to confirm her age before sharing nudes. But he blames me for the broken laptop and says I need to pay for it. He claims they are poor and that the wife needs the laptop for work. I was sent pictures of the broken laptop.  He says the laptop is worth $1200. Well in my panic state I send him money. I sent him $800 via cashapp and told him I would send the rest of the $400 in a couple weeks. 

After I sent him the money I was still freaking out. I didnt want to tell anyone what happened earlier because I didnt want them involved with my fuck up but now that I just lost $800 i had to talk to someone. So I reached out to a friend and talked to him about it. He said it sounded like a scam right away and I was being extorted. It wasnt too hard for me to believe that but I also feared being labeled a pedophile. He convinced me that in the morning I will call a lawyer and get their advice next.

That brings me to now. I am up at 2am because I cannot sleep with the fear that I may be in some serious trouble. So I googled my story and found multiple articles describing this exact scam. I even searched for the images of the broken laptop (friends suggestion) and found the exact images I was sent. So I am pissed and relieved all at the same time. I know it is a scam so Im less likely to get in trouble for unknowingly sexting a minor but at the same time Im out $800 plus lawyer fees. I still plan on consulting with a criminal lawyer just in case.  Oh I also might have found the ""wife's"" information. I already know I shouldnt use cashapp to send strangers money but their cashapp name had both first and last name. I typed their exact cashapp name into instagram and instantly found the chick. I also got her on facebook.

So reddit my question is this. Do I seek legal revenge and do you think that I am still at risk for the sexting despite being extorted and falling for a scam?",legaladvice,False,ifellforit777,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghkdot/underage_sexting_scam/

55,New coworkers call HR at the drop of a hat,1589187791,"Obligatory first time poster, throwaway account, on mobile, and if this is the wrong place to post this, let me know where I should go. 

I’m in CA, USA. Two late 20s, early 30s women got hired at work. Let’s call them Dee and Dum. They are sisters. I feel like they are misusing HR. The reason I’m looking for advice is: 

1. I like my team and I don’t want anyone to get fired (or worse). My supervisor is convinced that he’ll get fired because they call HR all the time. 

2. I’m afraid they’ll make false claims against me at some point. 

These two will not take any direction at all. We’ve tried to train them but they say “let us figure it out on our own.” They screw up a lot. It took me 2 hours to fix a job that Dum messed up. They both blame the screwup on the person helping them and call HR. 

They got sent home early because the job was done. (We are considered part-time and this is not out of the ordinary). They called HR. 

The boss didn’t need them because we were short on work last week and didn’t schedule them. They are going to call HR. 

The most egregious IMO is that there is a sweet old man (70 or 80 I don’t know for sure) and Dee claims he sexually harassed them when he was trying to help them do their job. There was a witness who refuted the claim. 

They seem to like me for some reason but I’m afraid I’ll do something to piss them off at some some point. I don’t want to be in their crosshairs for any reason. 

It seems like they want to make trouble and get a payout or something. I don’t want to see my teammates’ lives ruined for a dumb reason.

They have violated it numerous times, on video but the police have only charged them twice.

The first charge was from the beginning of December.  The police knocked on their door only once after seeing the video from the security camera at my door, but the neighbor didn't answer (they were home) so the police left.

Eventually I was able to find out an arraignment hearing was scheduled for April 1st.  But my neighbor continued to harass me.  Eventually in March the police charged them again (still not arrested, but they were taken to the hospital for 2 weeks this time, so I was okay with that.) That arraignment was scheduled for sometime in June.

Their April 1st arraignment got cancelled because of the pandemic, and hasn't been rescheduled even though there are supposed to be remote hearings and limited in person hearings still taking place.

In MN I know victims have a right to request a speedy trial, but I can't do that until after the arraignment.

61,Australia: Ex using court to torment ex-partner,1589187310,"Hello.  


I have a friend with several children who's ex became an ex after violence and stalking in another country.  My friend fled home to Australia.  Ex, also an Australian citizen AFAIK, followed.  My friend has had to move repeatedly due to threats of violence.  The ex has, at this count, perhaps four attempts to sue in court for custody of their child (as far as I know, the ex is only parent of this child, not of the others).  

My friend is, as a result of repeated hiring of lawyers and moving, living in poverty.  While they manage to school, feed and clothe their children, this is at the cost of food for themselves.  This is not a 'living okay, but doing it tough' situation - this is a 'skipping serious medical needs in order to heat a shed at a friend's for a baby' situation.  We have delivered things to them to ensure their children don't go without, and they work extremely hard to maintain normality, but by now are worn down.  We paid for the last lawyer for the last court case (my friend managed to pay us back after great hardship, which had I known about, would have forgiven the debt for).  Police in our location are...suboptimal with their beliefs about how much violence a partner and children should put up with because Two Parents Are Ideal.

Every time the Ex sues for sole custody of their child, they fail.  This is because they fail their court mandated drug tests, have not paid child support (ever, as far as I know) and because the TEENAGE child they want sole custody of wants to live with my friend.  Ex also failed at least once for not showing up to court at all.  So they will not succeed.  That's pretty certain. 

But Ex has enough money to keep suing...forever. This is entertainment for them, and allows them to argue that my friend cannot support their son appropriately due to poverty.  Every time my friend hires a lawyer, it gouges vast amounts of money out of a person living in complete poverty.   Apparently there has been a different judge every time, but I'm ignorant as to how this is continuing.

66,AMPM employee accused me of having fake ID,1589186236,"I went to AMPM today after getting off work, its right across the road from my work so a very convenient place to stop. I go in and stand in line for a few minutes and finally its my turn. I ask for a pack of Newport short menthals give the man my ID. He stood there looking at me and then said it wasn't a real identification card. Keep in mind I go here DAILY very often multiple times a day and this man has seen me plenty of times and always harasses me but the rest of the employees are really nice people so I continue going. After that he calls the police on me so I waited while he was on the phone hoping to clear my name as I'm wearing my name tag from work. Understandably that wasn't enough to prove the man then came around the counter, while he's on the phone with police and gets in my face yelling at me and i ask him to please step back as per my state (CA) social distancing policy. The employee refused to get out of my face. So I take a few steps back, he then approaches me again to continue screaming at me in my face. Spitting in my face throughout the entire time, luckily I happened to be wearing a mask (probably the 2nd time outside of work). I recorded the entire interaction and towards the end the AMPM employee smacked my arm very hard so stop me from recording.

After that the police show up walk in while I'm still recording and place ME in handcuffs. They walk me out. The cop explained I wasn't under arrest but I was detained. He asked what happened I explained just like the above paragraph, and he asks for my ID because he heard it was fake (reason for the 911 call) saw it was real and uncuffed me. I asked what I can do about being hit by the worker. He said I could press charges and have him arrested but then the other guy (employee) would have me arrested for TRESPASSING? How could I be arrested on account of tresspassing when I was never warned of not being welcome. After the employee said it was i told him I would wait for the police to show them myself. Eventually I chose not to make matters worse for myself as the employee said they were calling my employer to have me terminated. Is there any legal action I can take against AMPM for the assualt their employee commited. And would I actually face arrest if I press charges?

He comes in to my room and starts going on about how I owe him money for the phone bill me and a friend had together, that wasn’t even due for 2 weeks.

I told him I wouldn’t give him the money since I did not owe him that money, he then decides to try and grab me and throw me to the ground, I then jump up and get out of the room as fast as possible, but he is really close behind me.

I keep telling him to “stay away” and “stop coming towards me” but he keeps on coming, I end up in my younger brothers room who was just laying on his bed. My younger brother loved knives, so he had at least 40 or more knives sitting on his dresser. I quickly spot one and in a final effort to keep him from attacking me I pull a knife out and point it at him, telling him to stay back on more time. He then shouts at me, “go ahead and stab me you pos” I then proceed to throw the knife down since he decides to walk away.

71,I'm under a restraining order injunction for harassment. Do y'all think I will be able to pass a background for a firearm purchase [WI],1589185635,"Last year I was on probation for 2 non-violent misdemeanors. When a busy body friend of my ex learned of this she continuously fed my gf lies. My gf was very aware of my high-moderate drug use. I wasn't on getting tested from my PO. My family, friends, and gf were all cool with my drug intake. This woman wasn't. She told my gf that I was a heroin addict (never touched it), that my dad supplies me with heroin. 

It didn't stop there. This woman then claimed that I was on some sort of FBI watch list and that she knew an FBI agent who confirmed it. My gf claimed that this woman had a very elaborate security camera setup and also disclosed that her friend had been through a terribly abusive marriage. So I chalked it all up to that, and felt sorry for her

Later in a group setting with both my gf, this woman, and a few other people the subject of politics came up. This was following the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton and I said that I didn't think the shooters should be deemed ""domestic terrorists"" citing how fear of terrorism caused the trampling of Americans' constitutional rights under the Patriot Act, and also that fear of mass shootings is overblown.

The woman then claimed that this was a veiled threat. I let her know I knew she had been making things up about me. This caused her to go over the edge and file a police report and send the Co Sheriff to my house and give me her statement claiming that I had been threatening her for the previous 6mos along with all her other made up BS. My gf also said she tried to get the cops to search my apartment for drugs. I was in the last two weeks of my probation and she wanted a VOP and me to do 60 days. She was a very sick woman.

So when we're in court I'm trying to be rational while there's a hysterical woman flipping out and claiming I said and did everything under the sun. 

Hell, I feel bad for the judge  She couldn't make heads or tails of it. She didn't granr the injunction for the requested 4yrs. Only for one. But I was seriously pissed. This was the one time I'd been completely in the right but I couldn't win the case. Also IIRC when prepping for the case the legalese led me to believe that WI is a plaintiff friendly state.

Probably most pertinent is that when the clerk filed the order I was not forced to relinquish any weapons. Also this is what I found in tonight's research:

""Wisconsin prohibits the possession of a firearm by any person enjoined under a domestic abuse or child abuse restraining order or injunction, certain tribal injunctions1 or a harassment or elder abuse/adult-at-risk restraining order or injunction with an order prohibiting the possession of a firearm""

It doesn't include simple harassment injunctions.

During the end of 2019, I found other places to live. So I started planning to sublease my unit. Upon learning that I couldn’t cancel my lease with any fine and the releasing fee is 1000+. I decided it is best if I could find someone to move in and just pay me directly since it is a 1b/1b. 

Long story short, I found someone to move in on Jan. I asked him (I’ll refer him as D) to pay me rent on the beginning of the month and I collected an additional 1k deposit on the first payment from him so I can have ahead of time to find new people to move in case if he ditched our agreement.

However, on May 1st, D told me he is moving out this month and will not pay me any money since the deposit would cover it (it is 60$ short from the rent).

When I asked him when will he move out so I can collect the key. D ghosted me, still until today. 

Is there any legal action that I could do?

Could I call the management to swap the lock at my own cost?

78,Can I get a cash refund ?? Malindo air covid 19,1589184208,"Dear r/legal advice 

I was due to travel to Thailand and do 5 weeks round Thailand and Bali. Obviously I won’t be doing that now 
I had booked a flight with malindo air flying from Thailand to Kuala Lumpur, then Kuala Lumpur to Bali. 
Due to covid 19, Malindo air actually changed my booking. They have essentially changed one of my flights. In the email they used the word cancelled and so have put me on another flight. 
The issue with this is even if I was still able to travel (I can’t) I couldn’t use that flight anyway as it had me departing Kuala Lumpur before I even get there. 
When I contacted malindo air, like most airlines are only offering a travel voucher. However I won’t be back in Thailand within a year to use it 
Is there any way to get a cash refund like regulations or something ???

80,Friend's parents are taking advantage of him. (AZ),1589184035,"My friend has recently asked me what he should do about his parents actions.  I have given as much advice as I feel comfortable giving, seeing as how I've only taken a couple of law classes (that weren't about this type of thing at all) and I don't want to get something wrong.  This man has been a great friend for many years and he was even a groomsman at my wedding, so I want to make sure I get a second opinion before suggesting what I think I need to suggest.

I will give as much information as I can give without revealing any sort of identifiers.  Keep in mind that I potentially have an imperfect grasp on the facts of this case because I only know what I've seen personally and what he's told me.  I do trust him to be generally reliable, but everyone twists things a little.

These are the major grievances.

1.  His parents used money in his savings to pay for their bills when he was 17.  They said they would pay him back, but have never made specific payments designated towards that debt.  The amount was roughly $1000. 

I do not believe this to be actionable since he was a minor, but they did make a verbal agreement to repay him.  Haven't done any research on whether or not that changes anything legally, but I'm guessing it doesn't.

2.  His parents took a loan of $1830 from him last year in order to purchase a car.  They have since refused to make any payments, lied about the amount they borrowed (even though you can see the amount that was wired into their account on the statement for that month), given the car away, and tried to argue that they don't owe him anything anymore because they no longer own the car.

I'm fairly certain that this is legally actionable, as the ownership of something purchased with a loan has absolutely nothing to do with your duty to repay the amount that you borrowed.  They obviously still owe the money, regardless of what happened to the item that they bought with it.

3.  Taken out a credit card in his name without his permission.  He's asked for the card and the account information and they've refused to give it to him.  They said they did this to help him ""build credit"", but they've accrued a debt in excess of $5000 with only a year of use.  He found this out while filling taxes in February and confronted  them about this.  They claim that they plan to pay it off but he recently checked again and found that the credit card debt has actually grown slightly since confronting his parents.  

This is the big one.  Seems like a cut-and-dry case of identity theft to me.  Class 4 felony on that one, AFAIK.  If it was anyone BESIDES his parents, I would immediately recommend disputing the debt and contacting the police.  It gets messy though, because three of his siblings live with their parents.

4.  They verbally agreed to give him the truck (that he drives at his leisure and pays for all gas and maintenance) as a gift on several occasions throughout the years.  They have reneged on this many times.  At one point, they asked him to pay over $3600 to cover the truck, as well as insurance for some time.  He did so, over the course of a year. They've since reneged on this agreement as well, despite his full payment, and claim that he owes them $8000 for the truck (which is its full value).

The problem with this one is that the truck never switched into his name and everything was verbal.  I would imagine that he MIGHT be able to recover his money in a perfect world, but they could simply lie and say that the payments were just for insurance and not for the truck.  Since nothing was actually written, I don't think anything can really be done about this.

There are several more minor issues, but these four are the only issues that involve more than 1k in damages.  Anything lower than a thousand seemed pointless to bring up.  

All-in-all, I believe that he could go after his parents for about 7k for the fraudulent credit card debt and the money they borrowed from him for the car and refuse to repay, but I highly doubt that he has any way to recover the ~1k from when he was a minor or the 3.6k that he paid for the truck.  I'm also fairly certain that his parents should legally be charged with a Class 4 felony and face a sentence of up to 2.5 years in prison...

They may be crappy people, but they're still his parents and I would hate to see these issues tear their lives apart.  Would there possibly be a way to avoid bringing the charge forward, while still expunging the fraudulent debt?  Any way to recover those other debts that I believe to be unactionable?  Am I entirely mistaken on some aspect of this case?

TL;DR- Friend's parents owe him ~12k and refuse to pay any of it.  I think he can recover ~7k very easily.  However, his parents committed a felony and may face charges if he goes after the money.  He doesn't like his parents and rarely talks to them anymore, but I doubt he wants them in prison.

Living in Florida, renting an apartment with my SO. 

Our lease ended and we transferred to this apartment less than 2 months ago. Before moving, we were informed that the previous residents left before their first month was even done due to the upstairs neighbors because they wake and bake, then smoke all day. It doesn't bother us. We just wanted to know about the noise. We were told that the moving residents had no noise complaints, just the excessive marijuana use. 

We moved in on a Wednesday. By the weekend, there was noise all the time. We gave it a chance and introduced ourselves to them. In part, it was to let them know someone now lived there and also to address the party sounds in the middle of the night. Think more jumping/bass than music. It's been 6 weeks since then. The popcorn stuff on the ceiling has come down because of their antics. We've been up there multiple times, and emailed/spoken to management at least once a week since then. A lease violation was sent 2 Fridays ago. The noise died down for that weekend then got worse, day and night. 

Yesterday, one of them (or their visitors) tried to steal my package. They ran up the stairs before I saw them but when I yelled out, they dropped it over the side. Police were called, a report filed and management emaile &amp; a vmail left. The police can't do anything because it's a civil matter and they dropped the package/I didn't see a face. 

We want to be let out of the lease or transfer if management still refuses to handle this. We are anticipating a solid ""no"" to both, based on how they've been handling this. We don't know what to do, short of breaking the lease. But then, we'd owe thousands. Florida is not a very renter friendly state. As renters, can we pursue this in civil court?

87,Advice Suing Roommate Over Rent Not Paid,1589182139,"So I'll start by saying it's 4 of us in an apartment and we've been together over a year now at this place and rent itself has been paid on time but now due to COVID19 and everyone's kind of in a hiatus job wise.

So one of us, let's say his name is Joe, has a problem being on time with payments for other bills besides rent which I have to pay myself for everyone but Joe has gone a month sometimes even paying me what he owes for things because ""I need to remind him often"" which is irresponsible by itself.

So everyone's been paying rent, up until April and May. All the other 3 of us were sable to pay rent still but Joe has not paid April or May or any other bills he owes me for that matter. So we tried a Rental Deferment plan with the office so they can work with us. We all sign except Joe (who it's basically for to help us not get penalized for his part not paid) now here comes May and he decides to move everything out and just flat out moves all his stuff out and leaves. He basically said to one of us ""sorry can't pay anything"" and left. And Joe has terrible communication, absolutely no communication on his part to cooperate with us or the office which is frustrating. So now we're stuck paying his rent.

The office had kind of helped us in saying we should get him to sign a roommate release which we are doing so we don't accumulate more rent not paid from Joe's part and so we can move on and do a pay later balance with the office without Joe's signature and to get some replacement roommates.

So with April and May and other bills Joe owes $1,500. So with the office helping and suggesting, we're waiting until we get finally get him to sign the roommate release so we can tell him he better pay what he owes us by a certain date or we're taking him to court.

I don't see how he could possibly even win in court, it's basically 4(including leasing office help) vs 1 and we can provide payment proof and what everyone's been paying throughout the year, and messaged and everything.

90,"I discovered my apartment building has two managers. One for the people w/Rent Control, and a different manager for those without Rent Control.",1589181636,"Forgive the length in advance. 

I rent an apartment in Los Angeles. Been here going on 12 years. It's an older building and there is rent control. The building was sold 5 years ago to a new owner who made it clear he/she/they (the new owners) I don't know exactly who the owner is but it was clear they wanted the tenants with rent control out.

They started with our pets. Claiming that our leases did not allow pets. Long story short we hired a lawyer and all our animals became support animals so they couldn't force us to give away our pets or move. We won that fight but it's been non-stop with this Owner and the appointed Manager ever since. For starters we have a building complex that requires we have a manager on site. They claim there is one but there has never been. If any issues with the complex arise on the weekend. Waters not working. AC is not working. Plumbing issues. They all are put on hold til Monday. And then when you follow up Monday you are usually told the handyman is not available til later in the week. Unless it's a major issue (I won't say they haven't responded to the water being off for more than a day) but that even can take time because the Manager does not live here. The manager lives on the same street in a different building down the block. You leave messages and because he's not on site it's difficult to reach him. And when you do it's always as if you are bothering him vs. him doing his job as the Manager.

Cut to three weeks ago. I had an issue arise with my bedroom closet and I reported it the manager. It's in my kids bedroom and the closet structure is breaking away from the molding. Causing the doors to grind together and you can't open and shut it. I contacted the manager immediately via text. ""I will have my guy look at it next week."" he says. Monday arrives. I see the handyman on site. But he never comes. I follow up close to 5pm. The managers response. ""You have to text me in earlier in the day. My guy is gone."" I texted and asked ""If I could speak to his boss"". He called and started yelling at me then hung up. But he did text me a number so I called and I reached what appears to be either the owner or the owners lawyer. I explained I was having an issue with the Manager. The Lawyers response ""What unit are you in and how much rent do you pay?"" I said ""I didn't see how how much rent I pay matters."" He said ""Fine. If you don't tell me then I will instruct the manager to not make any repairs in your unit. How about that?"" Then I said ""I will contact my lawyer."" and I hung up.

I contacted a lawyer for a consultation, at which time he said to make a paper trail. Unfortunately there's no law against being a dick but there are laws to protect against them not fixing your apartment. So for now I'm putting all my requests in writing and they haven't responded. It's been three weeks.

But here's the latest thing and why I'm writing here. I was speaking with another tenant. One who is not under rent control explaining all this. And she was surprised by the Manager I deal with. She said. ""I have a number to a Mgmt. service. And any problems I have are dealt with by them immediately. I've never had to deal with the manager you do except when I first moved in. He showed me the apartment."" She's not rent controlled. She's a newer tenant.

I asked for the number and called it and heard a messaging service to a completely different management company. So now I'm thinking ""holy shit."" Each of the rent control people deal with the one manager. I know because we all complain about him, and the newer tenants, those that aren't under rent control get a different service entirely.

JM's video is accessible to the people on his friend list, approximately 300. Below I am outlining the contents of the video that I believe to be the most important:

1. Claims that the church is a cult, and discloses the name of the church. Does not state any empirical evidence.
2. Calls the pastor of a church a ""sociopath, crazy person"". Does not use the pastor's name.
3. Uses LW's first name, and claims LW is disabled based on the way he talked, the appearance of a limp and a scar on his head, but no other statement of evidence. 
4. Claims that LW's mother has been ""shit on by the men in her life""
5. Claims that LW (who is 21-22) is dating a girl who is underaged. **This is false**. She is 19-20. 
6. Claims that LW ""can't take care of himself, much less a child, or his younger brother who his mother puts fatherly responsibilities on him"". Does not state any empirical evidence.
7. Claims that LW's mother's current husband does not take responsibility for LW and his younger brother. Does not state any empirical evidence.
8. Claims that youth leader of the church hated LW and younger brother. Youth leader and JM previously lived together for a period of time. 
9. Claims that LW's mother ""lied to him for his entire life""
10. Claims that LW ""(doesn't) take care of himself, (doesn't) show up to his job, and shows up three hours later for a shift"". No statement of evidence.
11. Claims LW's brother did not have a father because the mother ""didn't keep them around, and was dating the wrong guys""
12. Reveals the fact that LW and girlfriend recently had a baby. Claims that LW engaged in sex with his minor girlfriend. **This can't be verified** as LW's girlfriend was born on June 20, 2000, and gave birth to their child in mid-March 2020. 

What are his options regarding the law? Is this evidence enough for my friend to file a lawsuit? I have a copy of the video as well.

My dog is a senior now, and she really needs care. My mom doesn’t abuse my dog but she could do better.

She texted me back saying that I don’t ever come over, I don’t treat her right, I wouldn’t help her or come over if she was dying, and I don’t need to reach out to her anymore and goodbye.

Recently he decided to add to the papers stating that whoever pays for my sons healthcare gets to claim him on their taxes. I’ve been claiming my son since the day he was born, his father and I were never married. Because I claim him, both my son and I receive Medi-Cal as we are eligible for the support (and need it). My ex refuses to pay Child support because he is active in my sons life and doesn’t agree that it’s fair even though I make significantly less than he does. I’ve always tried to pull my own weight and take care on my son by my own means, so I haven’t fought him much with child support, however this changes things. I’m not sure it’s even a valid stipulation. If he decides to start paying for healthcare for my son and claims him as a dependent without my knowledge, it will no longer deem me eligible for Medi-Cal, but I won’t be receiving child support on top of that, or tax breaks. So while he gets to save more money from taxes and not paying child support, I will be driven deeper down the hole having to pay additional healthcare bills that frankly I cannot afford. I am working hard and I don’t plan on or want to be reliant on the government support for longer than I absolutely have to be. 

I’m not sure what to do here, I’m not sure how to argue his request, and I’m not sure if there is a way to compromise. 

Any help is much appreciated. Thank you.",legaladvice,False,alwyzfamprobs,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghijku/child_custody_taxhealthcare_help/

99,A RUDE neighbor with an illegal mechanic shop? Keeps spilling oil and god knows what else,1589179445,"Recently a family of 5 rented the house next door. We don't live in the best area, and we didn't think much of it for a while until we noticed that they had 15+ cars over at all times parked all over around our house, people coming and going at all times of day, and constant noise and car repairs going on all the time. So. Much. Noise. Plus they've taken to hosing off gasoline, car oil, and whatever car fluids are used by mechanics into the entrance of our driveway. I'm sure it's some kind of environmental/health hazard.

We've asked them to stop with the fluids, and the noise. No response. We can't seem to get ahold of the landlord, and as far as I've heard from other neighbors, he doesn't care because our new neighbors pay him an extra high rent. He's also been kicked out of another house on our street for this same business.

In addition, one of the charming associates of our neighbor who just got out of prison (his words to my mom) constantly parks in front of our house. This guy is here ALL THE TIME. This is a private street, so theoretically no one can park in front of our house without permission like in most places, but the main thing is he keeps blocking our mailbox which we keep finding open and empty. My mom has asked him repeatedly to stop parking there and to stop blocking our mailbox, but he hasn't stopped and he's even yelled at her and flipped her off for bothering him. In any case, this seems to have the potential to escalate into a dangerous situation, and before this reaches Hatfield and McCoy status I'd like some advice because my mom gets upset too easily, and I'm not too sure of what to do.

1,My 102 year old grandma is not being taken care of by live in caregiver.,1589178965,"My grandma, who is 102, has been living under the care of my aunt for about 2 years. She pays my aunt 500$ a month plus free rent in her extra bedroom. Under their agreement, my aunt is supposed to take her to appointments, refil any prescriptions, cook her 2 meals a day, and keep the house generally clean. My aunt is not on the lease but has a close relationship with the landlady who lives next door. 
Since the beginning it has been made clear that they do not get along, my grandma speaks her mind and so does my aunt. 
Lately we have noticed the house is not clean whatsoever. We’ve been keeping our distance due to Coronavirus, but checked on her this week to make sure everything was okay after an argument between them. The shower was literally red with mildew, the carpet needs to be replaced and the fridge looked like it had never been cleaned. Cobwebs hung all over the ceiling, and the house smelled horrible.
She also has made it clear that she only intends on being “on the clock” 5 hours a day, which was not in the agreement. Neither one of them is happy. 
Last year we convinced my grandma to move to an assisted living community near us, which would be cheaper than her current situation + what she pays my aunt. She signed a lease and had a move in date, then suddenly she backed out and refused to talk about it. I have a feeling my aunt had something to do with this as it was so sudden as my grandma is her only security. It just seems when we find a living arrangement that my grandma is happy about, the next day or two she becomes extremely doubtful and I wonder if this has anything to do with my aunt.
My father is unable to take her into his own home as he is recovering from surgery and is aging himself, although still runs errands for her, and I would take her in as well but I just had a newborn and I don’t think I can handle it at the moment but would if it was the only way to help.

2,Legal responsibility for GRAB when not showing up for pre book travel resulting in missing flight (curfew situation in country),1589178940,"The other week I pre booked a grab for midnight having a flight at 3am.  There is a curfew in the country I am in for 10pm.  So at 8pm I did not no if travel after curfew by taxi was allowed (there are some rules that allow), so I used grab and did the pre book feature.  It accepted and sent me a message saying everything was good to go and my taxi would arrive around midnight.  Come 11:30ish the driver sends me a message and says, can not drive because curfew.  Now I have no chance to get another taxi or grab.

The argument I have is why does their system allow me to pre book at a time if they can't give me a ride and why didn't they notify me earlier.  If at 8 they said can't do because after curfew I could have easily just booked one at that time to go early.  Do they bear no responsibility, since I booked well in advance of the curfew and they did nothing?  

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I was not charged for the ride because it never occurred, so I am wondering if there is anything that can be done.   I talked to grab customer service and they shifted the blame to the poor driver who was only assigned my ride after the curfew and could do nothing about it.

3,"Not on an official lease, many unofficial tenants have lived here and owner wants me to pay for all damages and items left behind",1589178709,"Hello,

I'm living in Portland, OR. Two  years ago I moved into a house with a couple friends (both were already living there). It was our understanding that the owner of the house was ""Some hippie bohemian that has 150 houses and is just happy to get rent"".

When I moved in, the house was furnished and full of many dents/dings/mold/etc. but the rent was cheap so I didn't mind it. For the past 2 years I've been paying the one housemate, we'll call him John, rent he would then pay the owner. John decided to move out last month so the other housemate, we'll call him Alan, contacted the owner to let her know that we'd be giving her rent instead of John.

Soon after notifying the owner of the change, the property manager contacted us saying that we shouldn't even be there because we're not on the lease. Long story short, we've been working with them to get on an official lease but they're trying to pin all the damages and abandoned items on us (it's my understanding that this property went unchecked for 7-10 years and there have been around 7 unofficial tenants to pass live here in that time).

We're at the point where we definitely don't want to keep living here but would like some advice on how to handle this situation.

Timeline: (days are approximate)  
2018 August - Move in

2020 March \~22 - John notifies us that he plans to move out at the end April

2020 March \~30 - Alan notifies owner that we'd be paying instead of John

2020 March \~31 - Property manager contacts us and says we shouldn't be here

2020 April \~3 - Property manager comes to inspect the house to find various code violations (all present when Alan and I moved in) like indoor furniture on the porch, no stair railing to the basement and down the steps in the backyard, black mold in both bathrooms and the ceiling in one of the bathrooms was caving in, and junk lining the side and back of the house; a couple refrigerators, some mattresses and headboards, various other items that are not easily thrown in the trash)

2020 April \~7 - People come to haul the junk away and begin work on the moldy bathroom with the ceiling caving in.

2020 April ? - Alan and I submit our applications to rent the property.

2020 May 1 - Alan and I are approved and set a date to sign the lease. We sent an email asking about if we would be taking on all the damages and abandoned items from prior tenants, but no response.

2020 May 5 - Property manager and Owner come to the house, we ask them to answer our questions, they don't give a clear answer so we tell them we'd like to look the lease over before signing it and they obliged.

2020 May 6 - I sent another email telling them the lease looked good but I still had that outstanding question regarding the damages and abandoned items from previous tenants and they told me to forward all lease questions to their attorney, so I did.

2020 May 7 - The attorney responds to the initial email we'd sent and said the owner was retracting the lease and drafting up a new one, but shortly after he sent another email that basically said we'd be signing into the lease 'as-is' and we'd be responsible for all the damages and abandoned items but that ""The owner would unlikely come after you and Alan for any damages if you vacate.""

2020 May 10 - Alan and I have all our belongings packed and ready to move and searching for a place to move to, but we've not heard anything from either the property manager or their attorney.

Last week (5/4/20) my wife and I purchased an 8 week old French bulldog puppy from a breeder in Newport Beach (we live in Yorba Linda.)

On Thursday of last week (5/7) we took her to the vet to have her tested for parvo. Thankfully the test came back negative. We noticed that she has been coughing before vomiting, and after asking a family member who is a vet, we have determined she most likely has kennel cough.

This started up in either November or December. Becoming friends with every coworker led me to find out that (17F) had barely finished being 16 (birthday on 10/31) before the (26, 27M) started asking her out. At the beginning of this whole thing, I was working another job and only had a few hours, so I had no idea about what was happening up until December where I went to a bowling night with coworkers to see (26M) repeatedly touching (17F) at the bowling alley. Considering everyone else's non response, I chose to ignore his public and obvious advances. Then Hank (26M) kept giving Macey (17F) his beer without trying to hide it from bowling alley staff. Macey proceeds to get drunk, starts sloppily bowling, and the group has to get her water to calm her down so our whole group didn't get kicked out.

Months pass by, I don't look into things since I mistakenly trusted that the store manager (60F with kids) would have noticed and taken action.

Fast forward to now, and (17F) has maintained a friendship with me and a few other key coworkers, and done group activities, hot springs, hikes, more bowling etc. 

A few weeks ago things got very real and very sad. (17F) had commented to another co-worker she trusts who is a co-manager and almost like a sister type (her words) of relationship. Macey (17F) told me and her ""sister"" that she had been trying to break up with Hank (26M) for almost 2 months and he ""wouldn't let her."" She has cried in front of me, at said group activities, and she has expressed an excess amount of doubt that what she is doing is the best idea.

But as a teenager, she has flip-flopped a lot. One day seemingly fine, the next a mess (not at work) in messaging. I feel like I should report Hank (26M), and I feel like the psychological damage to a girl who is still so young may affect her for years to come.

I don't want my name on record since that will affect my work relationships, and depending on the day, my positive friendship with Macey (17F). It is clear that someone needs to be the adult and intervene.

What do I do? Can I report this anonymously to the police? How much evidence do I need for the cops to get something actionable?

I feel like this guy is ruining this poor girl's life, and even if not that, is controlling her every move, and threatening to kill himself if she leaves (her words).

They had me pay a security deposit prior to seeing the lease (too many people had asked for a lease without putting a security deposit down and I guess it was too much work to make a lease). I paid first months rent and my deposit. They sent me a video of the property. They would not let me see the property in person because of social distancing  Got the lease and felt good. 

Move in day the place was disgusting. There was rat poop everywhere. There are holes in the screens, everything was filthy. Tons of stuff needed to be repaired. The whole place smelled. I took pictures of everything. I text them to the landlady. She said the owner would give me $100 credit. I was desperate. The U-Haul was here, the movers were here, I had no where else to go. $100 and some elbow grease and I figured it'd be okay. 

It has not been ok. They've been doing shotty repairs, but as long as the gaps were fixed and stuff  I didn't care. However today was the last straw. Bedbugs. I've been getting bumps all week, but I hadn't really been thinking about bedbugs. Thought it was mosquitos. Until I found one, and another. I'm covered in bites. They've put in a work order, but the rat poop keeps coming and I'm trying to kill them off my sheets by washing everything and put it in bags. I've gotten quotes from pest control places, and it's all way above my price range. The landlord hasn't responded to any of my messages. Bedbugs are the responsibility of the tenant, but I've never had bedbugs. I'm disgusted, exhausted, and mad. Ultimately I would like out of my lease with my security deposit and rent reimbursed, as well as moving expenses if possible. I was combing through my lease again and I found this 

""Move-In Inspection: Prior to Tenant tendering a Security Deposit, Landlord shall provide Tenant with ""Move-In, Move-Out Inspection Form"" attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference itemizing any existing damages to Premises. Prior to taking occupancy, Tenant will be given the right to inspect Premises to ascertain the accuracy of the form. Both Landlord and Tenant shall sign the form and Tenant shall be entitled to retain a copy of the form. Tenant acknowledges that Tenant has carefully inspected the Premises, is familiar with the same and that the Premises are in a good and habitable condition.""

I should not have signed the lease. I realize this now, but they forced me to pay the non refundable security before I could read the lease. I was not able to see the property until move in day, and there was no move in check list, I just sent every picture to the landlord. 

Can a lawyer help me? I'm living in a disgusting place and covered in bug bites. I'm terrified to move out and carry bugs somewhere else. Please help me. I will be calling lawyers tomorrow, but some aren't open due to covid-19.

23,UPDATE - Suing a Fire Department for breaking the law,1589174981,"First and foremost, this is a throwaway account and will not be checked after I post this. No parties/cities/etc will be named. I will not name the state where this happened.

The original issue: I used to be a volunteer firefighter. There was hazing, destruction of public records and illegal discrimination going on and everyone in the small volunteer department was in on it. I was eventually fired from a volunteer position after complaining too much. 

I came on r/legaladvice and asked for some advice and everyone basically said call a lawyer, that's illegal, go sue em and that you can't do that sort of thing and attorneys love to take these kinds of cases on contingency and that I have a great case. I can't find the thread because I deliberately did it on a separate throwaway account. 

After talking to over a dozen attorneys, paying $200-500/hr for consultation, every one of them said the same thing: your case is worthless because you have no damages. You were not getting paid. Not even the biggest plaintiffs attorneys in the area wanted to take the case. I was into this thing for about $5000 in legal fees and everyone told me the same thing.

1. You have no damages.

2. The city's insurance company has a reputation for fighting anyone and everyone 

3. Even if you had damages, it's all your word versus theirs. You have no evidence whatsoever.

Nobody wanted the case, even if I did give them $30,000 and $300/hr.

So, I sharpened my pencil and went down to the federal courthouse and visited the law library. I filed the lawsuit myself and decided to fight city hall. 

The city tried their hardest to get the lawsuit thrown out but eventually, they caved and I got a sizable check for the disaster that was my career in public service and we settled all outstanding ligation courtesy of the insurance company that loves to fight.

TL/DR: I had a large legal dispute with the city fire chief as a volunteer. We hate each other. No attorney wanted my case, so I did it myself. I won.",legaladvice,False,firefighterthrowawa,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghhkcu/update_suing_a_fire_department_for_breaking_the/

26,Another lease break question - misrepresentation issues,1589174398,"I am wanting to break my lease. I have only lived at the property for a few weeks but have quickly realized it is truly just not a safe fit for me. There are several reasons, all of which I have brought up to the management company or maintenance staff over two weeks ago (right when I moved in). I have record of these requests that have not been taken care of.

\-First, the unit was advertised as having central air conditioning and a nest thermostat. No nest thermostat, which honestly is whatever...the real kicker is that I put in a maintenance request because my air wasn't working only to find out that the building actually has no central air system installed. They told me over a week ago that they would install a window unit for me. I have heard nothing. I would not have moved into this building if I knew it did not have central air. (Misrepresentation??)

\-The unit was advertised as having a nest deadbolt lock. I do not have any sort of deadbolt lock on the door to my apartment. Their reasoning why I do not have one was ""there's a deadbolt on the door to get in the apartment"". There are Airbnb units in the building that have nest deadbolts. 

\-There are vermin living in the ceiling and walls. I imagine they are possums as they sound larger than a rat or mouse. Very loud, they scratch at the structures all through the day and night. Maintenance told me last week pest control was scheduled to come, they did not.

\-None of the window locks work. Granted, I am on the top floor (third). However, the area is a rougher part of town. I don't really feel safe. The management's response time is several days later at best, and has only been empty promises or unfulfilled requests in the two weeks I have lived here thus far. 

Also, my lease has no early termination clause. I have no idea what would result from me telling them I want out at this point.

What is my best course of action here? I truly just want out. I can't imagine these people will get any easier to work with or more cooperative. I don't think I can make it a whole year in this lease feeling constantly on edge worrying about my safety, I am exhausted. Thank you in advance for your advice. I know I probably should have really done more of my own investigative work to begin with, but I'm hoping I can make it out of this learning experience somewhat unscathed.",legaladvice,False,Baby_Ruth22,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghhfvl/another_lease_break_question_misrepresentation/
27,"All my belongings got stolen, left with nothing, little to identify the person with",1589174359,"So this happened this morning and i genuinely have no idea what to do. 
I’m a senior in college and i attend college out of state. Since school shut down due to COVID, i moved into a friends apartment with my boyfriend near the school. They gave us only a few days to move out, and I had about 4 years of clothing / stuff accumulated that I needed to put somewhere. My boyfriend’s friends lived in a different house and let us store all of our stuff there in their garage. 
- My boyfriend and I live currently with two other young students in a house off of a main busy street. we see cars drive slow by it all the time and we always think they’re scoping it out because kids live here. 
- On May 8th at 3 am, me and my boyfriend were in bed when we saw a white car turn down our driveway and turn around. (very suspicious because our driveway is very long and there are plenty of easier ones to turn around in on the street). At this time, 2 cars were parked in our driveway. 
- On May 8th at 2 pm, our friends tell us we need to move our stuff out of their garage now because they are going home. we have nowhere to put it / no time to get a storage unit so we move everything from the garage to our back patio which is completely covered from the sides and you cannot see it or access it unless you are going to the back door. 
- On May 10th at 5 am, the same white car from earlier is seen on our security cameras turning into our driveway. this time, no cars were parked in our driveway. The car pulls up to our back door, a lady gets out and loads all of our stuff into her car. She pulls away and comes back 30 min later to fill the rest of her car up with our stuff. 

Now what we know for sure is she probably lives no more than 15 min away considering it took her 30 min to return including unloading time. She was unaware we had cameras and we have her exact car type, a photo of her (face blurry), and a video of her taking all of our stuff. The police say they cannot fix the resolution of the license plate to try and make it more clear which I find hard to believe and the letters are so close to being made out it is frustrating. It is also all of our stuff stolen, I am a senior that just graduated today from college and now I own absolutely nothing.

\- Car shakes above 45 mph , even after alignment

\- Most recently; break light indicators, traction, and check engine lights are suddenly on.   


She says they only gave her one piece of paper during the signing, this doesn't sound right to me. The dealership asked her to pay through Venmo, she's made two payments so far. One for $173.00 and the other for $172.54. April 2nd was last payment date, the dealer has not tried to contact them for their 2 missing payments (also fishy?).    


I will provide the APR and updated payment info once she's able to send it to me, her husband is using the vehicle (works nights). They are both very hardworking, have big hearts, and are still attaining higher education which sometimes leads to situations like this.

33,Who owns what?,1589173599,"I am located in Washington state.

I just recently bought a property with a building on it from a tax auction, and the septic system (which was approved by the Department of Health in 1998) is located on an adjacent lot. Both parcels were previously owned by one person, but when the parcels were foreclosed they were split up during the auction.

During the tax sale (which happened in 2003), my lot was purchased by the previous owner a few days before the adjacent lot. Neither of the Tax Deed records online show any record of a building. It looks like both lots were abandoned at that point and have been untouched by either owner. After doing some investigating, the owner of the adjacent lot is a 70 year old man.

The building is clearly on my parcel of land, but the adjacent property has the building listed on its tax assessment. As a result of having the building incorrectly attributed to the adjacent property, the property is showing an estimated value of $90k on Redfin (though the structure is only valued at $1000 by the tax assessor).

My goal is to renovate the building and live in it.

The questions I have are:

* What happens if the neighbor decides he doesn't want my septic on his property?
* Do I have any right to keep the septic as is, based on the fact that it was permitted and installed when both parcels were jointly owned?
* Is there a chance I could claim squatters rights / adverse possession on the property with the septic?
* Does the owner of the adjacent parcel have any claim to the building on my property due to the incorrect tax assessment? What about the fact that he has been paying increased taxes due to the building?

37,"Neighbor neglecting ktten, kept in outside cage in unsanitary conditions. Any possible actions?",1589172905,"A neighbor of my wife's family is keeping an approximately 4 week old kitten outside in a cage. The cage has no shelter inside, not even any blankets as the temperature drops below 50 degrees F. There is food in there but it is adult cat food for a kitten that is too small to eat it. There is also a small amount of water. The only other thing in the cage is urine drenched newspaper. The kitten has extremely crusty eyes which implies it is not getting the attention a cat of that age needs. The kitten is part of a litter born of strays. It is unclear if they found the litter on their property or not, and it is unknown what happened to the mother. My wife asked them about the kitten and they say the kitten is for their daughter who lives hours away. This daughter has also received multiple cats from prior stray litters. 

The reason this is a bigger issue is because the same neighbors have had kitten litters in the past that have been neglected to the point of death, and according to the daughters son, who lives with his grandparents, all the kittens that went to the daughter have died. A past litter, one of the kittens drowned because it was left in a box outside in the rain, and the rest froze from being left outside overnight. There have also been other issues of neglect/general disinterest in ""their"" cats. An example of their apathy is that the kittens that died were just thrown in the trash to dispose of the bodies. There is no proof of all of this other than my wife and her families testimony. 

In the past, with regards to previous litters kept by these neighbors, animal control was called and said they would do nothing about it. Last year, a stray had a litter on their property that they were claiming was theirs. My wife took the mom and kittens and tried repeatedly to find a shelter/humane society that would take them, it took multiple weeks to get them in to a shelter. As such, the local humane society has seemed ultimately worthless and they haven't tried to call them. 

My wife wanted to take the kitten to keep it safe, much like she did last year. This time however, instead of it being put out in a box or just left outside, it is in a cage. I told her that with the cage it implies more ownership and that to take it would be trespassing and theft. Is there any action we can or should take? We would be willing to home the kitten or have it be taken to a shelter.

46,Lemon Law on a salvage title? CA,1589171428,"Apologies if this isn’t the right flair. 

Last year, this month on May 4th I bought a salvage title 2010 Honda Accord coupe. I had only owned it for about 2 months (if that) before it started having major engine issues with oil and gas. 

This dealer is privately owned and family run. He also warranties his vehicles for 1 year, or 12K miles. He took my car in, and had it for just over a month for ‘engine repairs’ and to also fix a sensor in my driver seat for the airbags. I knew that was a very long time to have my car, and after constantly calling and checking up until that time, I told him I really needed it for work as I was still making payments. He told me it was ready then because he could probably hear the frustration in my tone.

I go and pick up my car, he didn’t fix the seat he said, and that the engine was a tough job but it’s all handled. He also carelessly mentioned that he had just disconnected my battery before I got there, to clear the codes?? I ask for the paperwork on the repairs and they give me a form and I leave. I notice after the fact that all that was written on the paper was “check engine light fixed” my car had more issues a few months later, went to the shop for another couple weeks. After getting it back he told me that if there’s any other issues to just bring it by. At this point, as of about January my check engine light is on. And whenever I bring it to him he just says he can throw a new spark plug on there to buy time for the misfire in the cylinder while he looks for a new engine.

In late February- early March I ask them to give me a written and signed statement saying that they will repair my engine outside of warranty parameters, considering he has been looking for an engine for over a month now. He says he can buy one, but after all the ‘work’ he’s done he is already diminishing his profit margin and won’t be making money off me, so he wants to get a cheaper engine.

Now with Covid, the shop is closed but they remain in there for other stuff? But say they can’t do repairs at this time and are still accepting payments obviously. It’s now May again, and officially a year since I’ve owned the car. Which means warranty would technically expire, yet I still have the (copied) email saying they will fix it. My seat sensor is back on, my car has been in the shop about 3 times, and I’m still having these same issues which cause horrible gas mileage and constant oil changes. He’s never given me a rental or temp car while repairs are done, and I still haven’t heard anything over the last two months about this engine he’s been searching for since the start of the year. 


This is the first car I’ve bought, I’m 24 years old and usually pretty passive. But what can I do to guarantee I get a working car that I’m still paying another 3 years on??

Her parents are charging her rent to continue living in the house. 

Her parents are also making her sign a contract that says if she doesn't pay, she'll be kicked out -- I'm almost positive that's under duress and thus not binding, but I'm not sure. She also said that she doesn't think her parents are reporting the money she gives them as part of their income.

53,Would not going to see an alleged detective be on my best interest?,1589170278,"I'm a teacher, I've been put on admin leave due and allegation, I dunno what the allegation is, the protocol for admin leave in my case is shady (not telling me what is, detective apparently working for police instead of employer, a building that belongs to children's advocacy center instead of usual building owner by my school district).

Now all this is been hell and a nightmare to me, I face the prospect or losing liberty and my job and being sent back to my county EVEN after things clearing up or so some lawyers say. Not to mention the psychollogical effects of this, I'm scared, fearful, my trust been abused, and I got this feeling that whoever i say, even you Reading this may doubt me and think I may have actually done whatever they may be accusing me of (it's a feeling leaves you feeling lonely and suicidal)

Anyway, seems a criminal lawyer may be best here. First I want to investigate who this detective is and why he was called and not the usual one and why in there? Then know what the allegation is of course.

At least two of them advised me to not go see the cops/the detective. In theory I'm under investigation and this isn't a formal appointment citation in which I got to go or else... Feels like that anyway.more like an invitation to go.. but I've been thinking these lawyers are probably right.. they can investigate all they want and I will cooperate with, THROUGH my lawyer.. it kind of goes against my instinct of ""I got nothing to hide"" but they say cops have all sorts of techniques to even incriminate the best teacher on earth you can imagine.

So anyway.. nightmare aside: is this what you would advise too? My employer may see it as not cooperating/admission of guilt maybe? But I'm thinking they may not rehire me anyway regardless of me being physically present in there or not. It's even more weird cause this allegation comes in a time when I was teaching online..and everything I wrote to my students can be seen no problem but I know it could be from before that.

I'm shattered by this.. and it's also starting to affect my loves ones of course.. seems to me someone is acting in Ill will towards me and I have my suspect. So frustrating to say the least. I wish this upon no one but that suspect if he's indeed the one behind which may turn out to.

Anyway: so .assuming this detective is legit and my employer knows of.. to go or not to go? Just send the lawyer? Give him my lawyer's number for cooperation and that's it?;why yes why not. Tho the prospect of losing my job despite the veredict is harming my faith on humanity, The urgent matters at hand is if course not being wrongfully incriminated by whatever allegation turns out to be.

54,"CCW charge in Detroit, Michigan need help",1589170161,"Posting this for my partner, however I was a witness to this event as well. My partner purchased a pistol in his name and registered it in another county where we live. He did not get his CPL because of the timing with the lockdown and many classes were suspended in our area. A few days later, he decided to transport his weapon in my vehicle with a lock box compliant with open carry laws since we were going to and from private property to grab money his family member had owed us. This is a high crime area in Detroit where his family member stays, one of the highest in the nation, so my car definitely stands out however it is a common make and model. 

I was sitting in the front seat of my car on my phone while he was in the front yard with his family member, he was open carrying the pistol on his hip after he took it from the trunk. He said he loaded the clip for the first time on the private property , and I know it was never shot once. None in the chamber. I did not see the police car approaching but he did so he went towards our car. Now my partner has intense anxiety about police and guns, as he was shot before and went to jail as an adolescent, so he does react with that anxiety in police situations even when he has nothing to hide. ** So for that reason he walked toward the car, opened the door, and set the pistol down before he could put it in his lock box. He did not want the pistol in his hand or on his hip as he was in the middle of securing it. ** He said he sat in the backseat but I did not see him do that before I saw the police lights in my rear view mirror.

They immediately cuffed him without identification, did not read his Miranda once he admitted to having a weapon when asked. He presented ID, no CPL. He had paperwork saying the gun was in his name. They did not search the vehicle. Did not ask for my name, ID, registration or insurance.

When he asked why they flicked our parked vehicle, they said they got a call about someone waving a gun in a vehicle matching the description of mine. They also said there was a shooting in the area, so initially my partner was overwhelmingly worried about that threat.They said that he needed to see a detective about the weapon, so they took him to the detainee center for 2 1/2 days. He never saw a detective and was released.

His court date has been rescheduled once due to the stay at home order extension. Now I figured it would be rescheduled again since his new date takes place in May before the state order ends. I’m reading things on the Detroit News that says they are doing Zoom hearings. He has got no notification of a virtual hearing for his CCW charge. On the court website, it says he had his arraignment in jail which is true. Next it says he has a probable cause hearing.

Here are my questions:

What is a probable cause hearing?

What is the best way to beat this CCW charge?.. do we challenge the illegal stop? Illegal arrest?

Do we challenge to see the 911 call that reports someone waving a gun?

I am a speech pathologist and our clinic was forced to close due to Covid 19. Up until now, We have been conducting therapy remotely for as many hours as we can and have been collecting unemployment for the remaining hours.

This week, our boss received approval for the PPP. Starting tomorrow, the clinic will re open and we will return being paid 40 hour/week ""salaries"" despite being hourly employees. Unfortunately, due to a decimated client base, it is unlikely that we will have 40 hours of work to complete in a week. Our boss is expecting us to complete other tasks, like paint and clean to help fill our 40 hour quota if there arent enough patients. However, Since we will be recieving 40 hours of wages, our boss is expecting us to pay back the paid (but unworked) hours at the end if the PPP. Thus, if I work 30 hours in a week, I will either need to pay my boss in cash or work 10 unpaid hours before the end of 2020.

I understand she is essentially giving us an advance, but I don't feel comfortable owing my boss anything. Is this fraud or illegal?

Who do I go after - the towing company, my neighbor, or the property owners? - California",1589169173,"My mom has lived in an apartment building in San Diego for 30 years. I live with her, although for the last few months I've been crashing at my brother's house in Los Angeles. My car is registered in Los Angeles as of January this year. I still receive mail at my mom's house, though I do not pay utilities and am not on the lease, mainly my credit card statement. 

Last Sunday, May 3rd, my brother and I drove down to visit mom. Mom texted our neighbor (Z) and asked if it would be okay to park in front of Z's garage while we unloaded the car. Z's garage is accessed from the rear of the building, where there are three garages in a row. The left most garage is owned by another resident and parked in front of that garage is the car of a different resident that has had their car there for a very long time. I was going to park in front of the middle and right garages, which are owned by Z and another long term resident, respectively, the latter of whom knows my car and even saw me drive up and was fine with my parking there. There are also two signs, one of which says \[TOW AWAY: Open public parking is prohibited; all unauthorized vehicles will be cited and/or towed away at owner's expense, etc\] and the other that says \[Resident Parking Only: Violators will be towed away.\]

I didn't park in front of the garages until Wednesday morning, however. On Thursday morning, I went out and my car was gone. The towing company was the one listed on the Tow Away sign, Western Towing. I contacted them and they had taken my car. My mom asked Z if they had called to have my car towed and they said they hadn't, as did their roommate. I went to go get my car and was charged $289 to get it out of storage. I asked them if they could say who had contacted them (the reason given on the paperwork was ""Blocking Garage"") and they said they weren't at liberty to say due to the potential for retaliation, so next I called the San Diego Police like the instructions I'd received told me to do if I believed I'd been wrongfully towed. A dispatcher there said that they could see that it was a private tow, not police related. Then I tried to call the property Owner, Real Properties Group, and when I heard back from them they said that they had not been asked to tow a car by one of their tenants, so that I would have to take it up with them personally.

How do I get the towing company to reveal who called for the tow? Am I correct that that person is the one from whom I should seek restitution? This will give me the clearest way to proceed, since I think the next step ought to be writing a letter to the person responsible for having called in the tow (whom I believe to be Z) or getting a lawyer to do it for me (which I don't want to do and doubt anyone would take up this small peanuts case anyway). I don't think confronting Z would be a good plan and not fruitful besides, and the property owners are pretty laissez-faire with a lot, so I'm sure they don't want anything to do with it. I just want the $289 back, so I know that the farthest this can go is small claims. Hopefully, it won't even come to that.

I bought my house about 3 years into a 6 year relationship that ended a year and a half ago.

I spend a night in jail and I  was charged with domestic violence. My lawyer was able to get the charge down to disturbance of the peace.

I was sitting on the couch watching tv performing dry fire drills with a relatively new firearm. I am not new to firearms and this is a regular thing I had practiced in the past to familiarize myself with the firearm. As I would do this, I would load it back up and set it down when the commercials were not on. At one point, I had released the magazine but did not clear the chamber (at the time I believed the gun was unloaded). I pulled the trigger hitting the tv. As you can imagine, I was shocked at what just happened and jumped up to go outside into the main hall to check on my neighbors. I had dialed 911 as I was opening my door to report the incident. As I went out, my neighbor came out of their apartment and asked if I had heard a loud noise. Seeing that they were okay, I told them that was me. At this time, the 911 operator had picked up so I stepped outside to explain what had happen while my roommate further checked on my neighbor and explained what had happened. After giving my address and explanation, I went back to the apartment and waited for the police to arrive. I told them what happened and after inspecting for damage I was arrested and charged with criminal recklessness - firing a gun into a dwelling or building where people are likely to gather.

71,Trying to legally bring back money from an offshore account,1589168004,"Seeking advice about getting money back to the US from an offshore account to help pay for medical school

My father moved to the US from xyz country around 1980. At the time, he used to save some of his taxed income in the US and some of it in an off shore account. He did this because he wasn’t sure whether he would return to Xyz country one day. 

Fast forward to around 2012. My father stayed, and continued to keep doing this. To my knowledge, here is the big issue: the money stored in Xyz has been collecting interest, but that money has not been reported to the IRS. Starting in 2012, a law was put in place to discourage this activity. Now, that money would need to be taxed 40% if we wanted to bring it back to US. This is frustrating, because that is my fathers taxed income. Alternatively, we can take it tax-free in increments of $8000. 

Now, the big issue: my older brother and I are both going to medical school in the next two years. We would like to use this money to help pay for our educations. However, we don’t think it’s worth paying the 40% tax. Is there any way can we get around this? For example, what if my father put the money in my uncles name? Could he then help pay it as a gift, or just pay it from abroad? Or would it end being revealed as illegal?

I never told anyone until about a year later because it slipped. cps was called and they interviewed me, my mom, and my brother (I don't know if they interviewed my molester).

I never saw a judge or talked to anyone else. my therapist tried to get me to say it was a lie and told me to think about how this would affect his life and well being. at the time I was searching questionable things on my own trying to find something to relate to and the caseworker pulled all of my histories up and read it out loud to my father, stepmom, step-sister, and brother. and told them to keep a better eye on my internet access. that was the end of it. recently (2020) I've been thinking more and more about pressing charges myself. at the very least I wanted to get an order of protection so that he wouldn't be able to be a vendor at any of the local conventions I frequent as he does currently. yesterday I spoke with my mother and she said it wouldn't work because I had no new evidence and since it wasn't enough back then it wouldn't be enough now.

88,Rights for disabled person in hospital being refused his caretaker present,1589165672,"My family is dealing with a really difficult situation and we are wondering if anyone has any ideas or people to contact. My uncle who is disabled from a brain stem injury and fully dependent on my mom - his caretaker, translator (she reads his lips), and decision maker regarding his health - had to go to Swedish Hospital in Edmonds, Washington for an emergency kidney stone operation. He’s in there alone and they refuse to let my mom in. 

He’s been there for a few days now, and keep in mind he has brain damage and can’t communicate on his own and she is legally his decision maker, and they won’t let her in to be with him. People giving birth get one support person to be with them so why can’t my uncle have his one person that has taken care of him for 30 years be there with him? It also says on their visitor policy page that people with my uncles conditions are allowed their advocate / support person. She keeps reading them this but they are ignoring her still. The hospital social worker is no help either. 

He’s extremely high risk for getting an  Pneumonia from aspirating due to swallowing issues. AND he’s in a double room with someone else. This is why they say my mom can’t come in. But can’t they move him to a single room? Also this is putting him at a greater risk of exposure to Covid from that person he’s sharing a room with (my uncle is so high risk for this). I’ve heard over and over the hospitals are empty. He can’t communicate to the nurses if he is in pain or uncomfortable because they don’t know how to communicate with him and my mom isn’t there to be the middle man. They let her in for one hour. She could tell that he was visibly uncomfortable and under stress, while the nurses, who don’t even know him said he was fine and relaxed. 

They literally threatened to call the police on my mom because she is insisting to be let in there. She doesn’t care if once she goes in she has to stay, which sounds like that’s the policy for pregnancies.

Anyways the hospital is blatantly refusing my uncle to have his caretaker and decision maker present to make sure he is being properly cared for (for example they were about to give him medicine by liquid in his mouth which would have caused him to aspirate). At this point my mom is getting so frustrated because he could very well get even more sick from staying in there without her taking care of him - he’s very special needs.

So Friday, the next day comes around and she brought him to my house. At first, he looked fine and acted about what you would expect for a 6-month-old German shepherd puppy. After she had handed me the dog we talked for a minute and I went to pay her. I gave her $400 cash and she left. After she left I realized there was a lot she did not tell me about Rambo, The first one was that for him being a 6-month-old puppy, Rambo didn't even know his name when he was being called. The second thing I noticed was that he had 0 training.

Fast forward a few minutes outside I remembered she said ""I did not feed him yet today, I did not want him to have an accident in the car on his way here."" so I went ahead and fed him. As he was eating I realized how skinny he was. he had a thick coat so I did not notice it until he was wet from the rain. As he was eating his bowl started to fall off the porch and I was going to grab it so it would not fall and he immediately showed food aggression.

I called her back to let her know all this and she told me to bad I am not taking him back. And here is where things take a turn. I remembered who she told me the breeder was and so I called him to let him know. The breeder told me that to be sure Rambo was a puppy that came from him I would have to look at his shot records. as I was looking through the stuff she gave me, the breeder informed me that he has everyone who gets a dog from him sign a contract. after looking at this shot records he told me that Rambo was, in fact, a puppy that came from him. He told me he would have to come to get Rambo because his contracts state that as a buyer you can not rehome a dog. If for whatever reason you can't take care of a dog it has to come back to him. I was never informed of the contract.

Fast forward to when he showed up to pick up Rambo he told me thanks for calling him because for the first five years of the dog's life he has to know where they are at otherwise he can lose his breeder's license. 6 hours after all this occurred the lady messaged me back and asked if I still had the dog and I did not respond and asked the breeder what I should do. He said don't message her back I will message her later tonight. Later that night I got a text message that he forwarded from her saying "" (Said woman's name), I need you to call the Vet @ (phone number) to give permission to have Rambo' s Vet Record's transferred. They open now till 7:30 her name is \*\*\*\* if not tomorrow from 9 am-11 am \*\*\*\* is in. You also need to Refund $400 Cash back to Matt (ME) immediately. If you don't comply asap then I will take you to small claims for breaking the contract. If you comply with what I am asking then I won't pursue filing the paperwork for small claims court. 

She responded to him and said ""Fuck off and die, I don't take orders from you or anyone so drop-dead asshole""

The next day he sent me a text saying that I would have to take her to small claims court because the money was between me and her. and he has to go to small claims with her son because he was the one who signed the contract and that she technically sold me the dog illegally due to the contract.

So now that is out of the way, Should I take her to small claims court for the $400? I was told if I went that way I would also most likely have to garnish her wages. But she doesn't work so I don't know what wages I could garnish. Thanks in advance.",legaladvice,False,itsmattthough,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghf9dc/ohio_need_advice_on_whether_or_not_i_should_take/
92,Landlord asking for 6 months of rent upfront before signing lease in CA.,1589165047,"My sisters and I are looking to lease a single family home in Glendale, CA. We submitted our application and the landlord is concerned by our financial situation. I am a graduating student and one of my sisters is unemployed, but the other has a job. We lost both our parents, but we have a beneficiary IRA worth roughly $300K each where we will be making our rent payments from.

The landlord said that she is concerned that 2/3 of us are unemployed and is asking for six months upfront of rent, plus a security deposit of both the first and last month of rent, totaling close to $30K. We included our beneficiary IRA account manager's letter of explanation, showing that we have more than enough to pay. In fact, we could technically pay a year in advance. But we have read things about it being illegal for a landlord to ask for six months of rent upfront.

We have been approved for another place, asking for the standard security deposit of one month of rent with no months upfront. She is the only one making these demands. The terms of our beneficiary IRA are that we must take mandatory disbursements and we can pull from the account without paying any penalties.

Is it illegal for her to ask for six months upfront of rent? Even if it's not, we believe it is an unreasonable demand and will be taking another offer.",legaladvice,False,electricguitar146,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghf8ut/landlord_asking_for_6_months_of_rent_upfront/

However a couple weeks ago i tried to make the peace. Then, after she was contacting my stbx husband saying derogatory things about me, I insulted her on 2 different occasions.

95,"Name on mailbox, but not on lease. Will it hold up in court?",1589164787,"Hey everyone,

My roommate and I received a letter from our landlord stating that 2 people are illegally subletting. Their names are on the mailbox as listed in the letter, but in their exhibit providing proof we were shown a description written up by a maintenance company stating somebody who the worker calls ""she"" multiple times without referring to a name whatsoever. Is this instance, coupled with their names being on the mailbox (even though that was NOT listed in reason supporting their suspicion, in fact, they did not mention names on the mailbox anywhere in the letter) sufficient enough evidence for a court to allow the landlord to evict us and charge us a months rent each per illegal subletter? There are no security cameras in or around the building and we do not talk to any of our neighbors.

We believe this is simply a scare tactic but we are being extra cautious as we do not want our credit to be ruined with an eviction and face the risk of homelessness.

Tldr; will a court find a report of a maintenance person calling someone ""she"" while only men are on the lease sufficient evidence of illegal subletting? If people's names are on a mailbox, is that sufficient enough proof to evict those on the lease and force them to pay fines?

98,Property Manager revealed I called about weed,1589164731,"So I had a roommate who would smoke weed and drink constantly in our apartment. I allowed it for a certain amount of time but eventually decided to call one of the employees of the complex and report it. That employee called the cops and my roommate was arrested with felony charges due to some other things found in the process. My call was anonymous. However, a couple weeks later that same employee was drunk at a party with my roommate and while under the influence revealed that I was the one who reported him. So I had to move apartments because my roommate hated me and I honestly feared for my safety. 

Was it illegal for the employee to reveal that I was the one who reported him? I figured those things were supposed to remain confidential. Because now I genuinely fear my roommate will find me years down the road and kill me for ruining his life. Okay that's a stretch, but still.
