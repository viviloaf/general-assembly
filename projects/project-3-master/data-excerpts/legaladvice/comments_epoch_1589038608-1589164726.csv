0,My brother stole our car and computer and is threatening to steal our dog.,1589164703,"My little brother (21 male) has decided out of the blue that in two weeks he is going to move with his gf of 3 months across the province to Huntsville, ON. He informed us that he will be taking one of the cars, which my parents let him borrow and he will be taking one of our family dogs on top of a $3200 laptop he stole. 

My parents informed him that he won't be taking the dog. He can visit him when he's home but he's not taking him. The dog is in my mother's name, he has been a part of our family for 10 years. My parents have paid for everything the dog has ever needed ie vet visits, medication, food. He has no legal claim to the dog. He believes that dog belongs to him because the dog used to sleep with him when he was home but he hasn't been home for more then 2 weeks in 4 years. 

He told us the dog belongs to him and he will just steal him when they aren't home and they will never find him. 

My parents are done fighting with him about the car (which he doesn't own) and have told him that he can have the car but they want to sign the insurance over to him as well as the ownership. They no longer want him driving under there insurance because he's a reckless driver.

When he came home to tell my parents about the move and him wanting to take the dog. He stole my mother work computer which he was allowed to use when at the house. He was told multiple times not to take it out of the house. It's worth $3200 and could get my mother in trouble at work if not returned. He won't return it unless we agree to sign the dog over to him. He plans on keeping the car and won't sign it over to his name because he can't afford the insurance. 

We don't know where he's living right now, other then that he's in Burlington and we know roughly where he's moving. 

I need to know what my options are. We are working on changing the locks to the house. My parents are heartbroken and at a loss for what to do. They don't really want to involve the cops but I don't see a way around it. 

In the past these things have worked themselves out or I would go and retrieve it myself but the car and computer are at his gf's parents. I can't just stroll up and take them back as much as I want too.

Any help would be awesome. 

Location:

Hamilton, ON 


Cliff notes:

My brother has my parents car and won't return it, we offered to transfer ownership and insurance of the car over to his name because my parents want him to have the ability to visit. 

He doesn't care to switch it over because my parents are currently paying for the insurance, we want him off the insurance. 

He said he is planning of taking the family dog. The dog is in my parents name, they take care of him, they look after him, they pay his vet bills. He only sleeps with the dog when he decides to come home. When they said no to him, he said his plan is to steal the dog when they aren't home. 

He also stole my mother's work computer valued at $3200. She doesn't own it and he won't return it unless we sign the dog over to him. 

If he steals the dog or leaves with the laptop we are screwed, we only know the town in which he's moving, we don't even know his girlfriend's last name. 

We need the laptop and to switch the car over to his name. I don't know what are options are. We know he's living in Burlington that's about it.

11,Employer spraying insecticide without notifying employees,1589163383,"I live in Canada and the situation is as follows:

There was a bed bug problem in the building for months. They were spotted frequently all over the building and on various employees.

Management placed traps under the desks where employees were asked to store their belongings. They did not provide bins or storage of any kind.

They brought in a professional to say that treatments weren't necessary as there was no infestation and bed bugs could not infest an office.

This is contradictory to the information provided by the extermination company directly, who a couple employees followed up with directly.

However, after employees continued to be upset over the apparent lack of action, HR and direct supervisors started telling us the building was treated regularly.

As the building is only empty of employees for a few hours, this raised safety questions, at which point they recanted and said the building was not treated and employees would be notified if spray treatments were used as they were big on transparency.

Eventually, six bugs are found within the course of a couple hours. The next weekend, certain employees are told the area is unavailable and to sit elsewhere for the weekend and that no further information would be made available.

Upon further pushing, HR denies any treatments have occured. Immediately after my meeting, literally within 10 minutes, an email goes out to select employees telling us the area is being treated but there are no harmful health effects. Other employees who work in a different department but sit in the same area were not notified continued to work in the treated area.

When questioned on the chemical used, HR pushed back but after a couple weeks, they gave the name of the chemical, admitted they had sprayed on at least one occasion without notifying anyone and said they would not confirm any of this in writing, either the name of the treatment or the dates and would not provide confirmation that the treatment was done by a professional.

The product, Temprid SC, contains beta-cyfluthrin and it's legally required that building occupants are notified and vacate the area for at least six hours. The building is empty for less than 7 hours and the area sprayed has no windows or doors to the outside.

When questioned, HR was insistent that the information came directly from an entomologist, who works for the extermination company and is somewhat of a local celebrity, and that they acted to ensure employee safety. However, the company's pesticide use agreement is publicly available and recommends those with certain health issues be out of the treated area for up to 24 hours.

Due to the obvious lies that were being told, the situation is well-documented with both screenshots and recorded meetings.

I know they have a history of doing this so they don't lose client hours. The workplace safety people came out and said everything was fine because of the email that was sent out on the one occasion.

Are there any legal avenues that can be taken to ensure that employees are kept safe?

Due to covid, we were given the option to work from home starting around mid-March and I took that option (everyone in my department did).

Last week we were told that we need to come back to the office starting 5/11. Except it will be 1 week in the office, 1 week work from home. It's also split 50/50 staff. So for example there are 10 people on my direct team, so 5 will be in the office at a time (we have about 10 teams with about the same or less people on each). We are also required to wear masks throughout the workday, and we must bring our own masks.

We are all very concerned about going back and feel that it's very early. Our seating arrangements are similar to a financial firm where it's one long table with no dividers, so it's very open. The reasoning they gave us for coming back was that they want patients to feel that it's safe to come to our hospitals again, yet I do not see patients, we only support the staff (doctors, nurses etc.) that our patients see. We also don't even see the doctors and nurses that we support as we are not located in the hospital, we have a corporate office a few miles away. So our interaction is strictly via phone or Microsoft teams.

I feel as a healthcare organization we know better than to bring people back to work unnecessarily, and everything that is being preached by hospital staff about staying home, we're essentially doing the opposite of. 

We also have been very productive at home, completing our typical day to day tasks, and also completing 3 projects that were supposed to go live by the end of 2020 and into 2021, all to help our hospitals with the covid situation. So to even suggest productivity is lacking would be false since we are required to work longer and harder because of the effect of covid on our hospitals.

I don't know what to do as I feel our concerns have fallen on deaf ears with our directors. Is it legal to require us to go back into the office, when I can 100% do my job from home? I am not an essential employee in the way a doctor or nurse is, and I assume that maybe the company gets away with this because they're considered essential, but I just don't think it's safe or smart to go back into the office when it can easily be avoided.

I did see on the NJ department of labor website, a form that allows you to report your employer if you're a non-essential employee who has the ability to work from home, but are still being forced to go into work. Don't think that would help with a quick turnaround though.

I told her there's nothing there because my brother was refused service on the basis of not wearing a mask, not because he is disabled. It is true that he does not wear the mask because of his disability, but if he was not disabled and didn't wear a mask, he would still be refused service.

But not finalized) and unfortunately even though they were divorcing, they were still seeing each other. He would one day be all for the divorce, telling her she needs to do this part of the divorce, the next hed be messaging her and wanting to see her and their son, inviting them over for a while, then a fight would ensue, shed leave and go stay somewhere, he'd blow up her phone with abuse, then be back to the divorce. There is a history of physical abuse as well, however the last incident I know about was a few years ago, so the recent stuff has been emotionally and verbally. He has never been abusive in any sort of way to my nephew, but obviously he hears all of this. 


This time, they got into a fight, but they had been ""together"" for a few months. She moved a large portion of her clothes and personal stuff to his house in that time. They got into the fight, and she left, her and my nephew are safe. She stopped communicating with him because he gets incredibly crazy during these stints, so I have taken up communication. To keep this short, when I got her stuff back from him, its missing A LOT of stuff. A fitbit watch, a bike, a lot of clothes. This was this afternoon, so she has yet to give me a full list of what's missing. He has gone radio silent, which is pretty normal for him because he's trying to be controlling in this situation. Honestly, I didn't expect him to give her all of her stuff back. 



In a few days when I have the complete list, I will be contacting him again. I completely expect him to blow me off, but I will give him the benefit of the doubt. If he refuses, what can I do then? It would hopefully be me doing all of this, as my sister is having a hard time with this and unless she really needs to contact him, I want to make sure she gets the space she needs to decompress.

26,CRASH!,1589161580,"Okay, bear with me - and hopefully I'm posting this on the right subreddit. I'm shaky and not quite sure how to proceed. My sister and I were just hit by another car and received a ticket for a red light infraction, which is absolutely not what happened.

Sis (driver) and I were driving home and came to an intersection. We STOPPED at the red light, then proceeded across the intersection when the light turned green. About halfway through the intersection I noticed a vehicle heading at us from the street perpendicular -- I screamed for my sister to stop, she slammed on the brakes, and the other car clipped the front of mine, taking off the entire bumper. As soon as I knew the crash was over I looked up at the the light to double check it was green (it was). The other car rolled over but ended up righting itself on its wheels. (This EASILY could have been A LOT worse.)

Anyway, after dealing with police, witnesses, etc, my sister was issued a ticket because a witness said we had the red light, which is absolutely false. I'm stunned and shaken up and now worried that this is going to be at ""at fault"" accident when we fully had a green light.

Once a judge rules on a case, future courts must use it to apply to their cases (especially with higher courts' decision). My question is when does precedent apply - more specifically in the following hypothetical case:

Person X is convicted of a crime. There has never been a person convicted in a case like X's before, but the judge sets a precedent that the actions done by X meet the definition of the crime. People in the past have been tried but cases tossed out because it wasn't defined.

Person Y committed the same actions as X five years prior. No case was brought up against them. After X's case, someone decides to turn Y in for the crime (SoL hasn't expired).

33,"Child moving out under less-than-amicable circumstances, possible to be charged with criminal car theft offense?",1589160819,"My girlfriend is 18 and intends to leave her parents' house. The circumstances there are dire and, essentially, her mom is abusive (mentally ill) and her dad is complicit, but given the right circumstances, he may be compelled to side with my girlfriend due to the fact that he himself is, in some sense, a victim of his wife's erratic and destructive behavior. That is the only reason this question arises.

My girlfriend has a car that is currently being paid for and is registered in her father's name. The way I see it, there are a few options, and I want to inquire which is most legally sound, as I don't want her to fall victim to action by the courts.

Option A: she leaves the car and relinquishes all rights to it. But, in this, she will definitely be left without a car and will have nothing, barring some miraculous act of generosity. This is a problem for a number of reasons (we live in a rural area and vehicles are necessary for survival, there is no public transportation. We are willing to accept that she just won't have a car if it happens, but it's less than ideal)

Option B: She takes the car with her when she moves out and either parks it at my house or somewhere public where she wouldn't be in possession of it. 

If we choose option B, there of course is a chance that the car will be reported stolen. It worries me that there is also a chance that she may be charged criminally with theft of a vehicle if this happens. My father is convinced that this will most likely be thrown into civil court and no criminal charges would be brought against her. However, I want to cover all bases. Is it possible that she will be charged criminally if we do everything by the book, including voluntarily relinquishing the vehicle if it's requested? And, if it is possible, in what ways could we help ourselves legally if it did happen?

My reasoning was that the car should be left on public property or essentially any property not my own and that since she would not be in possession of the car, there would be only circumstantial evidence and thus plausible deniability would be created.

34,Rent-to-Own Property from land owner with mortgage?,1589160680,"Hello, 

We bought our house last year and have a very small backyard, with a very dilapidated wooden fence running along the back end of it. My backyard is probably about 40x40ft. Right behind  that fence there is another section of land, probably the same dimensions (maybe a little bigger) covered in dead trees and brush and it is evident no one is using it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just got in touch with the property owner, a very sweet 88-year old lady. I told her I would be interested in buying it from her, knocking down my fence, and putting up a new fence along the new property lines to have a bigger fenced in yard for our dogs. She was very nice and said she was interested in it and would get back to me. She owns the property but does not live there, as it is a rental property for her.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, she stops by and talks to me about it. She says she has a 15-year mortgage on it (didn't specifically say how many years remaining, but that she plans on paying it off sooner than the original 15-year term). So while there is the mortgage, she cannot sell the property to me, but would be willing to do a rent-to-own. I pay her X per month, take out the trees, and put up my fence along the new property lines. She said whatever I pay her per month goes towards the eventual purchase of the land once there is no mortgage on the house; and if something comes up where we do not want to buy the land, we can always take the fence down and go back to the original property lines. 

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I live in Upstate New York. We plan on being in the house for at the least 3-5 more years, or if we do move sooner then we will most likely look to turn the house into a rental. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see two possible scenarios if we do this: A, she pays off her mortgage before we sell the house and everything works out well, we are able to annex the land and it becomes officially ours. Or B, something comes up and we have to sell the house before her mortgage is paid off. At that point we would have to look into either trying to do the purchase with the permission of her mortgage company (not liking our chances there) or take the fence down, give up the land and have it be hers again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on calling our closing attorney to discuss it with him, but I wanted to see if anyone has any firsthand experience or things I should make sure to ask. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My biggest concern:** given that she is 88 years old, what happens to our rent-to-own agreement in the event that she passes before the mortgage is paid off and the bank looks to foreclose? Will the force us to take out the fence and go back to the old lines, or do you think they would be willing to consider selling it to us? 

Let's say I make an agreement with this lady for $100/mo and an eventual purchase price of $10k (keeping in mind that the monthly rent contributes towards that price). If she passes 5 years from now and the bank takes over, we're only $6k in. If we have a signed agreement stating the $10k purchase price and I'm only $4k away, can the bank override that and do what they want or will they have to abide by that agreement?

46,"Issues with Property Manager and Landlord in Salem, OR",1589159305,"I'm located in Salem, Oregon and I'm in desperate need for advice on what to do next. Today I caught my property manager peeking through my window and when I brought it up to my landlord, he basically brushed it off. 

I have known she is generally nosey for a long time, but have never caught her being so invasive til now. Whenever any friend has come over in the past, if she runs into them she'll ask them all kinds of questions, not friendly chatting but things like what's their name, who are they here to see, or she may ask questions about other people that myself or my roommate have had over. 

The house we rent is split into 2 units and the property manager lives in a mother in law type house behind the main home. She has 3 car ports and we have a parking space as well that can fit up to 2 cars. The entrance for our seperate parking areas intersect. My upstairs neighbor in the other unit has a parking space on the other side of the house that is completely seperate. I bring this up because of the activity shes been up to in our parking area.

She stores her trash can and recycling bin adjacent to our parking area, in a strip of lawn that is the farthest from her area as possible. This is directly in view of our living room window, so now we generally keep our curtains drawn for privacy. I have suspected and recently confirmed that she is also allowing her 3 small dogs to defecate in this area and is not picking up their mess. She often will stand in our driveway area speaking loudly either on the phone or to her teenage son across the driveway.

Her and her son are also responsible for lawncare. I mention this because my bedroom is actually in the basement area and my window is level with the ground outside of it. I have a curtain up but there is about a half inch to an inch opening at the top of it that could be looked through if a person was closer than they should be. So when I brought up to my landlord that she had been looking through my window, he had said she was working on the landscaping / flowerbeds and had a right to do so. But the thing is, there is no flower bed there. Its mostly dirt and honestly isn't an area that is even normally worked on. 

Aside from all this, they have issued illegal eviction notices multiple times even after I've made them aware this is illegal (72 hour notices on the 4th or 5th of the month), given a 24 hr inspection notice after 3pm the day before when they said they would be entering the home at 8am the next morning, they also have been made aware of how the home was not at all cleaned and had damages when we moved in that should have been repaired prior to move in (missing lightbulbs, holes in the walls, a tremendous amount of dust dirt and spiderwebs in the basement, all of which i have documented). The landlord had indicated he would look into reducing deposit that was paid based on this and applying those funds to rent but never continued the conversation. They are also aware of the dishwasher not working since we have moved in, had the property manager (who is not a repairman) come look at it, and then never did anything more. 

One other thing thats happened recently is they're trying to charge some kind of fee over my roomates 2nd car that has been mostly parked since we moved in. This car runs fine, but my roomate works in caregiving and has a van that she prefers to use most of the time, so her other car has mostly gone unused over the last 6 months. The tags on it are good though, it's just not really something either of us have needed to use as much. I don't see why we wouldn't have the option to leave her car parked there though if we're paying for the space ? Seems unusual to me.

I just dont know what to do. My landlord refers me to the property manager, but she is acting innapropriately and not doing her job correctly and its been this way since the begining. My landlord is not allowing me the option to resolve this with him directly. I do not feel comfortable in my own home and haven't for some time.

I got into a bidding war with multiple people and the card ended up going for $710.00 US. The winner ended up not being able to pay for the item, so it was put up for a second chance offer to whomever jumped at it first. I ended up contacting the seller and we took the conversation from eBay to text message.

We messaged for a day or two and settled on a price of $600.00 US. I sent the first payment using the business option on PayPal and it took the protection money out of it, leaving him with $582.00 US. Seeing this, he asked if it was okay to refund him the money and use the family and friends option, I kindly obliged to the request. After roughly a week the card was sent to me and I received it three days later. 

While perusing the r/baseballcards subreddit a couple of days ago, someone else had posted a question about the authenticity of a Mike Trout rookie card that they also found on eBay (it might have been the base version or the gold version). This made me curious about the authenticity of my card. 

I decided to look at mine after I got home from work today. And after examining the card with a magnifying glass and comparing it to authentic Mike Trout rookie cards on eBay and authentic Topps cards in my collection, my father and I determined that the card in question is a poorly done counterfeit.

Red Flags pointing to its un-authenticity:

There was no glossy finish, no shininess where it should be, the lining is completely off, the players logo is uncolored on the back, and the use of a low end printer is evident by bad pixelation, etc.

The person who sold it to me pointed out on the listing that it is a reprint. A reprint in the card collecting hobby is something that is commissioned by the original printing company, in this case it would be Topps, and is sold as a reprint and says so on the card. This can be indicated by a number or the card saying that it is a reprint in wording.

I live in a great subdivision in Florida and for the most part get along with everyone.  My immediate neighbor to my right is just a terrible neighbor (dogs barking at odd hours for 1-2 hours at a time, not caring for their yard, whatever you can imagine not wanting to live next to they do it.).  

I’ve recently asked them (via text message) to please remove the trellis that they have tied to my fence.  Do I have any ground to stand on in asking them to remove it?  It’s very unsightly as it’s tied up with rope, I can see clearly from my side of the fence, and not even put up straight.  Now I confirmed that the fence is mine (I paid for the fence after my house was completed, and verified it’s inside 3 inches of my property line).  Now the neighbor responded to my initial text saying we can discuss the trellis but has not made himself available to speak in person with me or anymore through text.  Is this something i should just let go?  Am I out of line if I were to cut it down?  Aside from the vines he is attempting to grow on it it’s put on the fence that I literally just power washed off and was about to stain.

The agency collects rent for themselves and in term pays us a lease payment for the property. However due to the recent covid-19, most of the agency's properties have went into the red even though our property has remained in good standing and renters are still paying. This has led the agency to cease payment to us and keeps delaying it whenever we ask them. There is also a clause in the contract we signed with the agency stating that they would pay us a large sum as penalty if they are violating the contract (which they are). Is this case worth pursuing in Chinese court? My conjecture is that the agency is just going to keep milking the money as long as they can before taking off or declaring bankruptcy. We have contacted the renters of our property regarding the situation and they have agreed to sign direct contracts with us. Is this case worth pursuing in Chinese court? Will bankruptcy prevent the agency from having to pay the contract penalty? I know this is a stretch since it's in China but I'd appreciate any advice.

58,"Lease is up in June for a 4 bedroom apt. Three rooms will be empty, one will be occupied by someone renewing their lease. Does the remaining occupant have any leverage to stop the landlord from renting the other rooms until pandemic is over?",1589157937,"Hi all, this is a complicated one, so just hang in there. My best friend and I are renters in a college-style apartment that has 4 bedrooms. Each room equals a separate lease, with all being responsible for the total dollar amount each month in rent, divided by 4. 

My friend and I are closing on a home purchase (very exciting for us), and will not be renewing at the end of the lease. We occupy one room each. The third bedroom WAS occupied by someone else, but he broke his lease in the early days of the pandemic to shelter in place with his elderly parents. As roommates, we all agreed that the safest thing was to assume the cost of the third room, and leave it empty. 

The fourth room is occupied by a PhD student who never leaves. He is planning on renewing his lease, which would mean that finding three new roommates for June falls on his shoulders (we will help him,  because we don't think its fair). 

Our apartment is located in one of the hardest hit areas for covid-19. I feel that the risk of the remaining roommate becoming ill increases exponentially with each new person introduced to the space, and we are talking about 3 all at once, or else he will need to pay for all 4 rooms. He is laid off, and cannot do so, which would mean our leaving is essentially forcing him out also. 

My own personal sense of social justice feels that it would be unfair and unsafe for the landlord to require that all three bedrooms are filled while our region is still under heavy quarantine. The home is an open concept space, with one bathroom, so social distancing is not possible. We have all been working from home for weeks, and so have gone through the quarantine process

If the three of us band together, (though two of us are moving out) could we potentially force the landlord to leave the rooms unoccupied for the remaining person's safety? Without charging him for the rooms?? Are there any housing/public health regulations we can cite to try to support the remaining roommate? He does not have anywhere else to go. 

I know evictions are disallowed in my area, but since we are technically discussing lease renewal, this would not qualify. 

We are located in Massachusetts,  and in our region specifically Covid cases are increasing rather than plateaued.

I just got out of a toxic relationship of 2.5 years, ex is 24 I am 20


We were friends since I was 13 and he was 17-18, our friendship turned extremely inappropriate

It would escalate to him innapropreatly touching my chest when I was 14 when he came to my place for the first time ever “as a friend” (granted I lead him on, so, maybe partially my fault, but I was also attention and friend starved so.....maybe not, I still blame myself partially, and try not to think of it as sexual assault, we were both dumb, even if he was 18 at the time). 

During our relationship if we were in the middle of intercourse and I’d ask him to stop he’d complain that it “felt too good and that he didn’t want to” and wouldn’t stop until I pushed him off me.

**Location:** Roane County, Tennessee, USA

**Date:** 9 May 2020; about 19:10

**Summary:**

Last night I was driving home on a 4-lane highway, divided by a grassy median and occasional paved areas designed, I suppose, for U-turns and left turns. We were in the left lane, I can't swear to the speed limit but it's at least 45 mph, possibly 55 mph on some parts of the highway (and I'm one of those weirdos who tries to respect speed limits to around +/- 4 mph). The car in front of me pretty abruptly slows down and I presume goes to access the paved median and either turn left or turn around (there is no ""No U-Turn"" sign posted as far as I remember). I slam on the brakes but I guess it was just meant to be. We stop in the median, I check if they're ok, they were, so we decided to reconvene across the street in a business parking lot. Their car wouldn't stay running, so I help the passenger push it across the highway to get it out of the road. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other driver was a young lady (to not identify anyone, think licensed for a year or two, and a minor &lt;18) with her boyfriend in the passenger seat. She calls her parents arrive and I mostly dealt with her father after that. I was amenable to calling the police to get a report, but he decided he didn't want to do that because he's out of work due to COVID-19 and didn't want the burden of a ticket. He was also expressing concerns about how he didn't each other's ""insurance companies suing us."" Fine, whatever, I told him that at the time I was not interested that sort of thing either. The other driver and I took photos of each other's driver's licenses, insurance cards, and damage to both cars. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her family got her car to run but opening the trunk and messing with something they called an impact sensor (?). I offered to call AAA for them have it towed to wherever they wanted, but they seemed satisfied it was operational.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually asked her father ""So what's the solution here?"" He told me he would rather not involve insurance and he would find prices for a replacement rear bumper of their car, and asked me to pay half the cost (because he said the bumper that was on the car already was faded and worn already, their car is a 2002 model), and even offered to help me fix my own car (I informed him I intended to have my insurance handle my car). My reply was to find prices and we can stay in touch. The situation eventually ended a little abruptly after that conversation. He turned to his daughter and said ""go home and get in your other car,"" then turned to me a shook my hand, and everyone started leaving. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went home and submitted my insurance claim along with my photos and information. Awaiting a call back from a claims rep probably Monday May 11.

&amp;#x200B;

**The question:** I just want to find the best solution to resolve this and everyone forget the other ever existed. I expect my car will be fixed under my collision coverage, and if he wants to fix his own car with no claim to his own insurance, no skin off my nose. I'm amenable to paying half of the bumper cost if he finds one, and I don't expect it'll be over $300. Hell, he's out of work for COVID-19 and I'm still working, I could even be persuaded to pay the whole thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- How do I create a document trail that establishes this thing is settled with my payment for whatever agreed upon portion of their replacement parts?

&amp;#x200B;

\- The other driver was a minor at the time of the accident (18 soon), is it enough that I deal with her father or do I need to worry about her introducing some other elements/issues later on?",legaladvice,False,temporario11,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghda37/rear_end_collision_need_some_advice/

The issue this week is that he has his mother visiting from TN to OR. Ex has to work on Thursday the day he should return him by 4. But since he has work at 8am  he won't be the one watching the kid. He wants his mother to do it. Which by my understanding would constitute as disobeying the executive order since his mother doesn't live in the state. 

He's trying to take control of the situation and say it's going to be his way or the highway. She's scared of a full blown legal battle because his parents have money. And she doesn't. 

Mediation is NOT signed. And there is no law in effect here other then established parentage and the fact that they are married. She has lived and provided food and care for over a year and a half in the same house. Which he only lived in temporary after coming out here unannounced.

75,My University is effectively coercing me into paying fees for services that aren't rendered due to COVID19 to get my degree.,1589156283,"Lots of details to this but I'll try to stick to the highlights in hopes that it's more readable and I can get some advice!

&amp;#x200B;

I have no trouble telling you that this is occurring at the University of Madison - Wisconsin. For as long as I've been attending school here (undergrad/graduate degrees since 2009) the university board has become increasingly conservative and money focused. Of course, this has been the general trend of all major universities for decades as state funding has decreased from close to 50% to around 15% for UW Madison since 1976. The problem is that that burden has been shifted to students and in my case, right now, in a glaringly unethical way.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to be enrolled to graduate. In order to enroll I need to sign [this](https://bursar.wisc.edu/about/terms-and-conditions). Those are the terms and conditions that serve as a promissory note for all students. It outlines our legal obligations to pay all tuition and fees, no exceptions, or the university will sic collections and credit agencies after you while you pay for it all. Other than tuition, the university charges what they call ""segregated fees"" to students for on campus services. This is, of course, all well and good since I value my education and the university does provide services like health care, gyms, bus passes, union access, etc. - the cost of all this is questionable and never mind that 80% of those fees are diverted to other debts, which are not outlined in the actual services they tell us they're paying for. The problem is that the university has closed its campus in response to the COVID19 pandemic effectively barring students from using many of the services we are entitled to through our payments. I won't go into the details but you can look [here](https://bursar.wisc.edu/tuition-and-fees/tuition-rates/segregated-fees) to see how they are allocated.

In short, to graduate I need to enroll. In order to enroll I need to sign the promissory note. Once I sign that I am obligated to pay seg fees. The seg fees (ostensibly) pay for services like using our union (closed), using the gyms (closed), health services (phone in only at the moment), campus radio (nope), child care tuition assistance (no UW preschool while the campus is closed), bus pass (I'm not riding a bus for fear of spreading or contracting disease), you get the idea... I'm wondering if this sounds legal to you all? Would I have any success seeking legal help? Is it even worth it? This is just such an ethically disgusting thing the UW is doing to us right now on top of other shitty policies for example, furloughing it's faculty to make up for money it's over spending on campus development. I am more interested in what's right than the money aspect. I will eventually just pay the fucking fees and be done with it but I'm very interested to hear what you all have to say about this because so many graduate students are financially effected by this bullshit and it needs to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw - I've been speaking with our teaching assistant's union who've constantly been putting pressure on admin about these fees for years and they're telling me the admin are justifying the full costs by saying that at least some of the services are still available. Like, what the fuck? They outline costs, revoke access to campus, force us to pay, and say ""yeaaa well you get some so shut up and take your scraps or don't enroll.""

77,Landlord selling our condo that we rent,1589155811,"Hi all! We have lived in our condo for two years which we rent. Not gonna lie it's a really nice place, and after a few years the price of the rental market has gone up. We pay 1500$ a month, but now a two bedroom unit could go in our area for probably 1800-2000 for the quality we pay for. 

Before our landlord put our place on the market, he offered for us to buy it. We weren't in an ideal financial position to buy it so we turned him down unfortunately, thinking we couldn't legally get kicked out.

Fast forward half a year, our landlord has officially put his property on the market, and we have learned that we could get kicked out with 60 days notice. We can only get kicked out we think if the new owners move in, or immediate family moves in. So now we know we can get kicked out. 

Anyways we don't want to move, cause we love our condo. Just wanna know what our rights are as tenants.

78,"I had a loaded gun pointed at me, unprovoked, by a security guard with video evidence, legally what can I do about it?",1589155773,"So as some of you may have recently seen \[this post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/ggufni/security\_guard\_points\_gun\_at\_skateboarders/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/ggufni/security_guard_points_gun_at_skateboarders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)) on r/PublicFreakout, that is me with the loaded firearm pointed at my body. This happened in north eastern Ohio.    



The story behind this is, my friends and I went to skateboard in a heated parking garage that is a pretty frequently visited spot by us and others. Sometime security gives us the boot but it is always with respect from both parties. However, this time, a new security guard who later identifies himself in the video as an ""off duty police officer"" (yet to be proven), does not ask us to leave or approach us in any way but instead, sneaks up, with his gun out and starts yelling things like ""how many people are down here"" and ""how'd you get down here"" (not breaking and entering, there are clearly marked doors and even an elevator) at me about a two minutes before the video starts. I answer them and then my friends realize he's been pointing a gun at me this entire time and they get involved, that's when the video starts. In the video, my friend recording asks ""Did we do anything to threaten you?"" and he even says ""No you did not"".    



My question is, what can I do about this besides report his actions to the local PD and the management of the parking garage? What is the legality behind this? Would it be wise or worth the time and money to hire a lawyer and prosecute? The whole thing has been a pretty traumatizing experience from not knowing if this guy was about to unload his weapon into me for skateboarding in a parking garage.",legaladvice,False,Na_palm,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghct6t/i_had_a_loaded_gun_pointed_at_me_unprovoked_by_a/
79,Evicting a family member,1589155743,"I live in California.

The Facts:
I bought a house in September of 2019 that had a detached garage in the backyard. My wife's sister needed a place to stay so we began converting ot to a 1 bedroom apartment. We discussed that it would take time to complete the project and she could live in the house with until it was completed. After the bedroom, living room and kitchen were completed, she decided she wanted to move from the main house to the apartment. She had full access to the bathroom and keys to our house so she could come and go as she pleased and was happy with that as we finished the bathroom.  There had been several delays and the bathroom is now completed. The only thing missing is a hot water heater.  We have no written rental or lease agreement. She is on ssi and goes to school. Her rent of 600 is paid automatically by her bank in the form of a check that is mailed to me. Before we started any of this we said we would need her to pay rent to be able to afford any of this. She pays nothing for pge or xable/internet; we all agreed to this.

The Issues:
Recently she has been fighting with her boyfriend and getting us in the middle of it. They'll get in a fight and she'll stop taking his calls and try to avoid him. They are on again off again on basically a daily basis. Today her boyfriend showed up looking for her and when she found out she started texting me saying that she pays rent and she was calling the police on him (that's her right).

The Question:
Aside from all the family drama and what should be done with that, if she wants to try to withhold rent, can she be evicted even though the rental is not legally habitable? This isn't necessarily something I want to do, but if she does threaten it I would like to know what to say or do.",legaladvice,False,ChickenBasher88,/r/legaladvice/comments/ghcswb/evicting_a_family_member/

84,Removing Roommate from Lease,1589155330,"After a disagreement over a lock and her trying to rent her room out without my permission for two weeks, my roommate sent a message requesting me to take a notarized letter to the office removing her from the lease or I could add an additional lock to the door on Monday. I responded and told her that I would remove her from the lease if she paid $1200 (half of the breaking lease fee) and that I would have somebody come Monday to add the lock. She responded that her removal from the lease would be without fee and I said okay. 

Here’s the thing. She does not spend nights here. She only comes home once every 10-14 days or so to wash clothes. Could I wait until her June rent is paid to remove her from the lease without getting in legal trouble since she already documented it would be fine for me to remove her with a notarized letter to the leasing office? My thinking is that she technically doesn’t live here because she hasn’t spent two weeks home at all and the only thing that legally proves her residence here is that she is on the lease. Also she has been texting me for two months trying to figure out a way to get out of the lease without fee or penalty. (I at least want June rent paid because her asking to be off the lease at a moments notice is not ideal). Also I’m concerned about adding an additional lock since she has given her key to a friend I don’t know and I notice somebody tried to get in the apartment last night (currently filing a police report for that).

I don't know what to do.",1589155214,"I had Garrett when I was 17 going on 18 and to be honest he did not have a great childhood. His dad was absent (real POS) and he and I did not get along. As soon as he turned 18 he was out of the house. Last I time I heard from him he was taking classes at a community college in Florida. My other son Peter, who has moderate/mild ID, was very close to Garrett and was really upset when he moved out. He said Garrett called him all the time but I assumed he was just pretending. 

Well few weeks ago Peter tells me that he is moving out. I obviously don't believe him because 1) he has no job 2) no money 3) no place to go. Well a week later Garrett shows up and knocks on the door. Says he's there to pick up Peter. I have no idea what is going on. I ask Garrett what the hell he thinks he's doing and he says Peter is moving in with him. I asked him how he planned on taking care of him if he has to work. Apparently, Garrett ended up working in finance. According to him he ""shorted the hospitality sector"" (still unsure what that means) and is getting such a large bonus that he no longer has to work. I don't know if I believe him but that is besides the point. I obviously forbid Peter to go. 

As soon as I said that Peter starts saying he is an adult. Over and over again. Like he had been coached. ""I'm 22 I'm an adult I can go where I want"". Peter was carrying and I told him he couldn't take his stuff. I told him if he was an adult he didn't need any help from me. He started getting upset, but Garrett said he'd buy him new stuff and not to worry about it. Garrett asked if Peter had his passport. Peter must have some how stolen it from my room because he gave it to Garrett. Garrett told him to get in the car. I told them I was calling the Police but they just left!

Well I have been worried sick about him and calling everyone who may know Garrett or where he is. I got in touch with an old girlfriend of Garrett's, who has him on social media. I told her the situation and here is what I found out. Apparently Garrett has been partying nonstop with a bunch of loose women and taking Peter with him. She recorded his story and I have to say I was disgusted. Peter is drinking alcohol. Smoking cigars. He was slapping girls on the butt. Riding on an intertube by himself. On the story I saw a white powder that may have been cocaine on the table of the cabin. It was heart breaking. Peter is mentally a child. He can barely put on his shirt himself, and now his brother is corrupting him for laughs. Who knows what they are doing off camera??

I have a month-to-month gym contract at an independent gym in my city. They have been closed since at least early March and are still closed due to COVID-19. At the end of March they charged my credit card my membership fee and a building maintenance fee, despite being closed for weeks at the time and for the foreseeable future. I had already been planning on canceling my membership, so thought this was the perfect time. I called the facility and got no answer, which is understandable. I then sent two emails, about a week apart, stating I wanted to cancel my membership and an explanation as to why I was continuing to be charged while they were closed. During this time I read their reviews online for the first time since I had joined and turns out these guys are total scam artists with multiple people saying they’ve been charged after cancelation, had dates on contracts changed by the owner, locking them in for longer than they actually agreed, a lot of people being taken to collections after they didn’t actually process membership cancelations, etc.

I contacted my credit card company to put a stop on their charges so they cannot continue to charge my card, which I know from other members they are still doing.

Two years ago my uncle was in the local news.  He had created a “Blessings Box” on the front of his property by the street.  The idea is that it’s free food, take as much as you need, no cost.  This idea was like wildfire in our local area.  The article spawned 20-30 more ppl to do the same.

The fight came over me bringing up legal liability.  To which I hadn’t even chosen firm ground to make a statement.  It was more a topic statement to inspire discussion and thought.  I didn’t expect to have to immediately defend the position of there existing a liability.  

Now do I think that a true threat is likely scenario for them?  No.  My family (grandmother, although others were complicit) stuck to the argument that there isn’t any liability to this.  Like firm stick, in concrete, they weren’t budging even though I made several points that were at the very least something to think about.

These boxes are just plywood contraptions.  They are nice but they have no insulation so whatever items are in there are exposed to cold and heat, constantly, for who knows how long.  They do have a door and covering to prevent precipitation from effecting them.  Another valid point is that, these boxes aren’t secured.  Anyone could walk by and put anything they damn well please in there.

5,Kicked out of school because of depression and anxiety,1589152662,"This is an extremely long story so I will try and capture the main situation.

I'm an 18 year old sixth form student living in London. I have had depression and anxiety since I was 6. Anxiety and depression become a million times worse when I have exams. I've always been top of the class and a high achieving student. 

•i started sixth form in september 2018 and was enjoying my time

•As the year went on, teachers and heads of year were telling us what would happen if we were to fail our exams, this was when my anxiety began

•I had revised for my exams and was ready to do them, however the night before I had a series of anxiety attacks and was physically sick. I was told by my parents to not do the exam

•I went to school the next day to try and sit the exam, however I threw up in the toilet moments before. I told my head of year that I was incapable of doing the test and he told me he had no sympathy for me and sent me home.

•I eventually ended up doing the exams and got Us

•I was allowed to retake the exams after my therapist emailed them to tell them about my mental health situation. I was told I was able to retake 1 day before the first exam.

•after retaking, I failed again and was told I couldnt progress to year 13

•After 10s of emails were exchanged between us and the school they invited us for a meeting in which they said under no circumstances they would allow me to go to year 13.

•I was allowed to retake year 12 doing the subjects I did the year before. I took this option as my mother was very distraught and wanted me back in school

•I became more depressed every day and ended up losing a lot of weight. Every night I was having nightmares about school and exams. I would wake up having panic attacks and it would wake my parents up too.

•After months of not attending school, I decided to teach myself and become a private candidate. I did this and I had tutors to support me

•One day I heard banging on my door. I live in an apartment so I should have heard someone ringing from downstairs but I didn't. The person was banging on the door shouting ""[MY NAME] OPEN THE DOOR ITS MS XXXXX FROM SCHOOL. WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN COMING IN?!?"" She was shouting this for all of my neigbours to hear.

•I called my mum, she heard what happened and so did her boss. She told me not to open the door.

•I was receiving calls from a private number which I knew was the teacher as I could hear ringing from outside the door 

•she also called my mum to tell her to tell me to open the door. 

•my mum talked with a friend about this and was told that this was against the law as I was under 18 at the time (I dont understand quite what this was)

•we emailed the school about this and told them what they did, we believed to be against the law and i was let back into school

I'm sorry this was extremely long, however I would like to sue the school. They have caused me years of serious emotional trauma and have caused me to start taking anti depressants on top of the pills I already take. So much more had happened that I havent written up there regarding their carelessness. Is there anything I can do to sue the school? Is this even valid ground to sue? Or am I just being immature.

6,[CA] Landlord has requested a lease amendment related to COVID-19 one week after signing apartment lease. Should I agree?,1589152587,"My new landlord (through her real estate agent) has asked me to sign a new form that was recently published by California Association of Realtors entitled ""Coronavirus Addendum or Amendment"" C.A.R. Form CVA-LR, 04/16/20 ([link](https://imgur.com/a/LMVBcDe)).  For context, the lease agreement has already been signed by tenant (me) and landlord, and deposit check has been paid and deposited, prior to this request.  The move-in will occur at the end of May.  The form appears to give either party an ""out"" if they cannot fulfill the terms of the lease due to COVID-19.  My concern is that if I sign, this form could be used by my landlord to terminate our lease agreement prematurely or otherwise sidestep eviction laws by invoking a ""unforseen Corona Circumstance"".  I understand that the agreement would also offer me some protections if I had a ""unforseen Corona Circumstance"" but I am lucky to be in a position, financially and otherwise, where I am very confident I will not need any protections afforded by this agreement.  I would rather stick to the standard lease. The form says it is optional to sign, so as a first step I have told my landlord I would prefer not to sign, and am awaiting reply.

17,I think my ex-employer paid me with money from a PPP loan. Can I legally cash it?,1589151632,"Okay so I'm normally a lurker and I just read previous posts to answer my questions, but this is a pretty unique situation.

I live in a small town in Wisconsin and for the past three years I have worked at the same local theater. It's a very small movie theater that doesn't get much business. I quit this year in the middle of March because I felt unsafe working with COVID-19 going around in the US. I handed in my letter of immediate resignation on March 18th and explained the situation to my manager and went my own way. 

Today, in the mail, I received what I assumed was my last paycheck since they never mailed it to me and I never went to pick it up since the building was closed. When I opened it, it was a check for way more than I should have been paid for my last 2 weeks. When I looked a bit closer, I realized the check was from the PPP loan they must have been approved for to keep paying their employees. It's quite a small check (under $400) but it would be very helpful right now.

I texted my old manager right away to explain that I thought it was a mistake. The conversation went as follows:
OP: ""Hey, so I just got a check in the mail from the theater. I'm assuming it's from the small business loan thing, but I don't think I should have gotten one. I just wanted to let you know since I think it's a mistake. Just let me know what to do with it.""
MANAGER: ""It's not a mistake as far as I know""

And that leaves us here. Am I legally allowed to cash this check? I could really use the money right now but I technically quit so I don't work there anymore. The only reason I could think of for me getting this is that my manager never officially turned in my letter of resignation. The place is run pretty poorly and it's a very small place so it isn't run very professionally. We don't have an HR department and I don't even have my actually boss's number as he is a pretty laissez-faire guy.

19,University CARES Act advice!,1589151502,"Hello everyone! I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to post this but here goes nothing. I'm seeking advice on how to proceed in filling out a form to request some emergency funds from my school.

As part of the CARES act, my school has been granted around 2 million dollars to give to students who have expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the coronavirus

In order to receive this money, the school is requiring that I fill out a form that details the expenses I have had since the disruption. Now, I'm eligible to apply for these funds, but idk if I actually meet the criteria to receive them.

**the criteria**: ""students must submit the application showing expenses they have incurred related to the disruption of campus operations due to the novel coronavirus.  The expenses can be related to housing, food, course materials, technology, health care, or child care""

**""Examples of ineligible reasons** **to receive HEERF funds** • Lost wages due to loss of job as a result of COVID19 • Paying rent for an apartment that you were previously living in prior to the disruption of campus operations • Technology expenses that were previously purchased prior to the disruption of campus operations (i.e. purchased laptop at the beginning of the school year, already have WIFI at home)""

So after I read the two bold segments, I realized that I might not have anything that I can count as an expense. But then I read this in the FAQ: ""**Do I need to provide receipts to receive the HEERF Funds?** Not unless the University deems it to be necessary.  Please remember that when you fill out the application, this is a legal document that the University will maintain in the event the Department of Education requires information on how the funds were awarded.  Though not directly related, any person caught lying on the FAFSA is subject to penalties of up to five years in prison and a fine of $20,000 under the Higher Education Act of 1965.""

That part got me thinking, ""if they aren't asking for receipts, cant I just *say* that I had an expense?""  I'm fresh out of college (finished today) and have been furloughed until further notice. I had some plans for post-graduation but now i'm a bit worried about the next time I will be able to make money the way I want to so every cent I get will be instrumental in keeping me afloat.

My question for everyone is: How do I (should I?) take advantage of this opportunity?

Here are the exact instructions on the form:

When filling out the form, please put in the amount of the expense you have incurred, as well as an explanation of the expense. With each expense, you must be able to answer **“how is this expense related to the disruption of campus operations due to the coronavirus?""** If the expense cannot be tied back to the disruption of campus operations, you cannot list the expense. Please be aware that the Department of Education has stated that a loss of income due to the coronavirus is not an acceptable reason for receiving HEERF funding.

20,Legal advice over temporary guardianship (I really need help please),1589151293,"I really need some answers please

My parents were manipulated into giving temporary guardianship of my sister (15) to her friends mom. The mother then asked my sister for her social security number without notifying us first.  

They made this “agreement” through email and both parties agreed for a few weeks. But it has been 3 months and the social worker said it is legally binding even if one party retracts their agreement. 

The agreement was made for 2 weeks then they kept extending it and changing the reason for it.  The email just says it gives temporary guardianship (no court order or anything) nothing else 

I do not think a half assed written email is legally binding. Also can social workers make legal say in this situation. She said I legally can not talk to her or reach out to her or her doctors unless she contacts me first. She also threatened to get Child protection services involved if I spoke out and tried to get involved. 


My home is perfectly fine and I think the other family is brainwashing her and using covid as an excuse. They say she is not allowed near the house in fear of getting my mom sick yet my sister and I put our lives at risk everyday.

30,Stimulus Check Held Without Stimulus,1589150244,"Hey y'all. I've posted on here before regarding my ex and some troubles I'm having with getting some of my possessions back. This, sadly, is a new problem I'm having with his mother. For reference, I live in Texas. 

As most of us know, stimulus checks from the government have been given to some people. My check was sent to my ex's mother's house as I was using her address in 2018. The bank account I had used to direct deposit my 2018 tax refund has been closed and for whatever reason the IRS decided to send the check there instead of my new address, which I used for my 2019 taxes or the direct deposit I used for my 2019 return as well.

I've been reaching out to the ex's mom for well over 3 weeks trying to get my check from her, which I've been documenting. Every time I talk to her, she tells me she is going to mail the check so I leave her alone. After a week goes by and still no check, I reach out to her again. I always get the same response that she's going to mail the check but it's going on a month and I still don't have a check. It should be noted that I'm not messaging her everyday; I call, we talk for a few minutes and she tells me she's going to mail it, I say cool I'll be looking for it and thanks then we hang up. To document our conversation, I send a quick text afterwards recapping that she said she will mail the check, like your HR department at work would do after having a redirecting conversation. 

3 days ago, I received a letter from the President (one of those mass printed letters) about the stimulus checks being sent out and it had a number to the IRS to call about the stimulus checks. 

I called the IRS and essentially was told there was nothing they could do as they're showing the check has been cashed.

I'm really not sure what to do now, as I still haven't received my items I originally posted about and now my stimulus check has been cashed? Is there any legal actions I can take? Once the city they're in opens up, I'm going up there with a police officer to collect my items, but I'm not sure what to do about my stimulus check? I'm honestly at a loss and I'm slightly frustrated at the whole situation.

31,[VA] How to determine if I have good cause to quit my job in order to receive unemployment benefits?,1589150238,"As of Friday, I am back at work after being furloughed. I work in Crisis Stabilization. I was told that the reason for this is due to a change in the Department of Medical Assistance Services \[DMAS\] regulations requiring a ratio of client to counselor of 1:1. However, I cannot find this documentation anywhere. I suspect that being called back (along with other colleagues) has to do with PPP loan forgiveness.

Social distancing: On paper, we are being required to adhere to social distancing guidelines with staff and clients. In actuality, the children are not social distancing because they don't understand the concept (or, at least, they are incapable). The staff is also not social distancing with fellow staff nor with clients. This afternoon, in a particularly troubling event, three counselors and one client were all sitting at a picnic table, none of whom were wearing masks.

PPE: Which brings me to another point: on paper, we are all supposed to be wearing masks whenever possible. So, always unless one is eating or drinking. In actuality, myself and my direct supervisor are the only ones wearing masks. The rest of the staff are either not wearing them at all or do so with irregularity. None of the clients are wearing masks and are not required to.

Temperature checks: Clients, not staff, are undergoing required temperature checks. However, these checks are being done AFTER they are transported to the center (by staff) and AFTER they interact with other children and staff. These temperature checks are such a farce, that one staff member took a child's temperature today and it registered at 92 degrees. Instead of rechecking (or, calling for an ambulance) she simply wrote it down. We have no medical staff on the team. Only Qualified Mental Health Professionals and various counselors.

Telehealth: Only assessors are allowed to use telehealth. Telehealth is not an option for any other staff for any other purpose. I don't know if this is a company policy or DMAS policy.

Risk: I work predominantly with a Medicaid population. Needless to say, the parents of these children are more likely to have pre-existing health conditions. Many children are foster children who are being taken care of by elderly folks. This is what has spurred me to action this evening - meeting the elderly foster parents of one of my clients. I feel sick with the knowledge that I could be contributing to someone's death but staying mum on what is going on for a paycheck. The children are with us for 8 hours a day. 7 hours in the center during the week and 6 hours in the center on the weekend.

Edit: Documentation: I forgot to mention that we have been instructed on our documentation to omit any mention of ""group."" It looks, on paper, like we are providing these services in a 1:1 setting. I have this in writing.

When three years came up, he asked me to give him a break until our youngest child finished high school; he was 16 at this time. I informally agreed, ie I did not sue him, for the next two years.  

That was stupid. Two more years go by and he does not sell or refinance. I was in the process of relocating to another state at this time so I didn't sue him then either.   

I kept telling him he needs to refinance and I do not want my name on his mortgage, I want this over with, especially because he missed mortgage payments often so my credit is now shit. He tells me I need to sign a quit claim deed so he can sell or refinance. I was not able to travel back halfway across the country to do that, so I gave my youngest POA and he signed it under my name. (He was 21 at the time.).  

Nothing happened. I want to buy a new house but can't because I'm still on his mortgage. Cut to 2019. He has completely defaulted on his mortgage and they are foreclosing the house.

New to reddit so forgive formatting. I have also tried to read the Vermont consumer protection legal stuff but I don't understand it which is how I got here. 

I live outside of Burlington and have a gym membership which, to be honest, is more than I want to pay but it is nice and has changed my life. I use the gym daily and shower there, so COVID added some costs to my life. Regardless of my situation of being unemployed due to COVID (and unable to get unemployment), I recently found out that my gym has continued to charge its members. 

I called asking about this, since I assumed it would be suspended until reopening. 1. the gym owner will not give a refund, claiming the email said they would continue charging (it was vaguely worded saying nothing about continuing to charge, rather it asked for support as they navigate this crisis) 2. they say that they legally can because they have been posting facebook videos

This situation irks because  since the high living costs, combined with new challenges, puts me in a situation where I really cannot afford to pay $160 for two months of a gym membership I can't use and their inability to be flexible and give a 2 month extension is bizarre. I feel deceived by their lack of transparency and sneaky language, but they claim they legally can continue to charge. 

More simply, my gym is charging me for a service I cannot use and I have a contract there (for automatic billing and membership).

Hi everyone,
I’m trying to help my brother stay away from abusive and neglectful parents. My grandmother currently has custody of him, she was also my guardian for the majority of my life growing up. Our mother is fighting for him back. We are all very scared the court might let her take him from us. She is not mentally stable, is usually homeless, surrounds herself with toxic and abusive people, is emotionally always on edge, and has been a drug addict on and off for the majority of her life. My mama is still beautiful and can hide it at times in her face with makeup. Most people can tell she has had a hard life though. I just don’t know what can happen in this situation, she’s a danger to herself and others. I love her very much, but the best place for my brother is at my grandmother's until she gets to her best self. My mom's motive for getting my brother back is to fill her void. At times when she has had him, she immediately can’t handle the constant care of another human being. This leads my brother to be in the arms of whoever is closest to her. My baby brother deserves more than that. He is doing amazing at my grandmother's house, he is growing and learning every day. He has his own room, homeschooling, cousins to play with, healthy food, a huge loving family. My family is even willing to help my mom, once she takes the first steps to better herself. My father who is not the father of the baby and an abusive toxic person is now around her. CPS took me away from both of my parents. My mother has retreated back to him because he enables her in exchange for her company. My father is trying to help my mom get my baby brother, in order to make my brother his own. I do feel he is trying to get back at me because I never felt safe in his presence and ultimately did not want anything to do with him because of his abusive pattern. My father is smart, and my mother is vulnerable to someone like him. I’m scared for her too. I’ve written decelerations, and letters to the court. My mother just filed an ex-parte, filled with many lies. I’m going to have to go back point by point and refute every single lie she has put. I plan on doing an opposition to her termination of guardianship papers. **DOES  ANYONE HAVE ANY  ADVICE  OR FREE LEGAL AID THEY CAN DIRECT ME TO? I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO A LAWYER LAST WEEK BUT THEY HAVE NOT GOTTEN BACK TO ME BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL BACKED UP.** I’m trying to save my brother from a lonely and sad childhood. I feel like he will have it worse than I did because my mom is the worst she has ever been. I love my mom, I think about her every day and pray she will finally see the truth and understand. I want her to understand and see why we are doing this. No one wants to hurt her, but we have to do what’s right for my beautiful baby boy. He lights up the world, he has already gone through so much. If my mother gets him I don’t know where that path will lead. I know he will face many more obstacles than he should.

45,Dental licensing issues in the context of Corona,1589148712,"Hey guys

So I’m a newly graduated dentist moving to Ohio soon. My fiancée has a medical job there as a physician so I don’t have the ability to move locations to avoid the madness im about to explain....

Long story short, dental licensing is usually accomplished by performing certain dental procedures on humans in a test setting. As long as you pass the test, dental boards nationwide will give you a license after you do some basic documentation and pay them a fee. With corona, the company who offers this test has switched entirely to mannequin tests and has stated that they have no plans to offer testing on humans any time soon.

The dental board of Ohio decided yesterday that they will refuse to accept the mannequin test as there is no evidence it is equivalent to testing on actual people. This is obviously absurd as there has never been an event like corona that has prevented testing on humans. They are offering a temporary license that will expire in October, but this license has a bunch of caveats like requiring direct supervision of practice by another dentist, etc etc. Basically the barrier to entry is getting absurdly high. The caveats with the temporary license are going to fully prevent any new dentist from opening a practice on their own and even will make dental employers think twice about hiring us new dentists due to the burdensome requirements that the temporary license will place on those already-practicing dentists.

Any advice/suggestions as to how to proceed would be great. Obviously I’ll try to get the temporary license but I really think I’m going to have tremendous difficulty getting any dental employer to consider hiring me with it. We’ve tried to convey these issues to the dental board of Ohio but they frankly do not care.

fast forward to this week, on previous occasions  I was not here, the hot water has gone again, the breaker switch on the fuse box had tripped, when I flipped it back there was a chemical burning smell coming from the cupboard where the water tank is. 
Flipped the power back off and called out the plumber, after fiddling around with the boiler for a bit he said the problem was with the cut off switch to the boiler and said we needed an electrician. The electrician I called out checked the wiring and said there was nothing wrong with it and it was the immersion heater. 

This evening I have had another look at the thermostat on top of the watertank, I can clearly see scotch marks on the underside of the aluminium cap that covers the thermostat, there is white residue coming from it that is clearly the source of the smell that occurs when there is power going to it. I know the plumber took this cap off and cannot understand how he could have missed this. 

I am not sure where to go from here, part of me thinks we should insist he cones back and fixes it, however, I am not sure I trust the plumber after today.

51,[CA] Received unemployment benefits even though I never filled out any follow-up paperwork and employer should have denied the request.,1589147879,"This might be a dumb question but I know times are a little crazy at the moment and I'm perplexed as to how this could even happen. 

In February, when concerns over Covid 19 began to rise, my employer began cutting hours of employees a few days of the week. Naturally, I applied for unemployment because of the reduced hours as recommended by the state. Shortly after submitting the initial application, my employer notified us that they will be participating in the CARES program and we would be receiving our full 40 hr/wk pay regardless of how much we worked. They also advised us that we absolutely could not collect unemployment benefits while on this program and that if we had already submitted a claim that they would deny it but we should try to cancel it if we could. Of course, with the high volume of unemployment requests currently it is all but impossible to contact the EDD office to do so. 

Fast forward to today: I have ignored all follow-up paperwork for the unemployment claim past the initial application as instructed to do so fully expecting that my employer has denied the claim. Check my mail and I have received a prepaid unemployment benefits card. I checked the account and it contains that entire month and half's salary (that I have also gotten paid for through the CARES program). 

I guess my question is, what is my responsibility here? Am I on the hook for this money for a claim that never should have gone through? Should I notify HR? Will I be ineligible to go on unemployment insurance when our participation in the CARES act ends next week?

I send the money through Zelle (online transaction) as requested, but the mover claims he didn't receive the money and sends screenshots showing he didn't receive it in the 2 days after I sent it, which is suspicious since it should have taken minutes/hours. We contact my bank, his bank, and Zelle and find that the problem most likely stems from his bank, since my bank confirms they sent the money and it reached his bank properly. The money has left my account.

**Then, as we try and track this transaction,** the check that the subletter sent me almost a week ago is canceled as ""invalid"" and the money she sent me leaves my account. Now I've lost $1700 of my own money. For over a week we attempt to resolve the issue but the mover and subletter respond infrequently and in the past 3-4 days I have been unable to reach them through text or call.

My bank is filing a dispute but say it is unlikely to work since it's been weeks. I'm incredibly frustrated with myself and desperate to get the money back.

63,"A 14yo. Friend of Mine Lives With Her Parents and There is Enough Child Neglect to Call CPS, But My Family Who Lives in Separate State Wants Custody / Fostership / Guardianship Over Her. Is this possible?",1589146666,"Okay, so first of all, this is a throwaway account, she doesn't want to risk any of this getting out to her parents until after we figure out more of the situation. She isn't withholding anything, she just doesn't want to get into a serious argument without being fully prepared and risk her (possibly) one and only chance at getting out before 18. To specify, she is 14 and turns 15 later this year.

&amp;#x200B;

To put things as brief as possible, her living situation is bad enough to call CPS. There is no doubt about that. Everything that she has gone through has pushed her to become grotesquely underweight (100lbs. or less her entire life), crippling nausea and migraines from the stress of her family and hoarder house, and has frequent and easily triggered panic attacks from stressful situations. Her adopted sister who recently moved out has suffered from numerous mental disorders her entire life; like hallucinations and depression, and has taken multiple attempts at suicide. The reason this is particularly relevant is because until her sister moved out of the house they shared a room, and her sister would constantly share her visions, thoughts, and behaviors to my friend which definitely contributed to her anxieties and previously listed emotional issues.

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason she has not called CPS is because she has the fear that if she is denied living with my family, she could end up in a worse situation than the one she is in. She is also worried for her other siblings and what could happen to them.

&amp;#x200B;

  
My friend lives in Wisconsin while my family lives in Oregon. My younger brother has known her about a year and half, maybe longer, but I've only really been talking to her maybe 2 months. My mom made a joke about us being a foster family for her, but after talking about it for a few minutes, it actually became a more serious claim and possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My family is more than fit for her, especially in comparison to her current living environment. We have better schools, she'd have her own room here, access to a shower, a clean house, a more financially stable family, she wouldn't be around mental illness, she would no longer have her medical and psychological needs near-endlessly or endlessly  postponed, and she'd also be happier because this is something that she truly wants.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In case it is relevant, her specific living situation is written here: 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She lives with her mom who has Bipolar Disorder and is the main cause of the hoarding. My friend lives with her two older brothers, one of which is a high-functioning autistic 16 or 17 year old. Her dad might be the one person that she can truly depend on and look up to in her life. The unfortunate part about that is that her dad works a state away for his job and spends 2 or more hours just driving to and from work. With the quarantine he has been working from home as much as he can and it has given him the opportunity to work on the mess. The mess includes dog and cat feces, hundreds of fruit flies, rotten food and things, unwashed dishes for months/ years, close to absolutely zero counter or table space to put anything, no direct path way to walk in most rooms of the house, and just so much more that I may never fully understand or know. There is no working shower or other sanitation options and she is forced to take showers at other places, which the quarantine has effected. There has been at least 5 dogs and 2 cats at the same time that I know of (the dogs have not been neutered or spayed, and that has caused problems in the past).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am certain there is more, I will edit more here as I remember it and consult her for more info if she is willing to have it listed. I can't imagine that this post will stay up forever.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So that is the whole story and situation, now we are looking for what we need to do to make any of this happen or if it is even possible to begin with, so:  


1. Is it possible to get her out of her home in Wisconsin and over here in Oregon in the first place? By this I mostly mean is the crossing of state lines an impassable roadblock and should we give up on getting her here? (note that we do not care what the term is- foster family, adoption, legal guardianship, other- we just want her out and safe.)  

2. Should we look into establishing this home as a suitable foster home with CPS? Is it even necessary in the first place?  

3. If total guardianship (or whatever term) is impossible, is there anything else we can do to limit her time in her home in Wisconsin and expand her time here in Oregon?  

4. Should we look into a lawyer on my families side, my friend's side, both sides, or neither side?
5. Is there anything that could be a deal breaker that we should be on the look out for?

77,Houston Real Estate Issue,1589146021,"Hey guys, this is my first post, under not so great circumstances :|

I'd appreciate yall's input because I've spoken to a few lawyers and heard different things from each of them, leaving me unsure what to do. Here is my situation:

I am in the process of purchasing a condo in Houston, TX and the closing date was Monday 5/4. I received an email from what seemed to be from the title company (on 4/30) with wiring instructions to send them the down payment money so we can close without delay. I forwarded the email to my realtor and asked  ""Is this fine? Just want to double check."" He responded "" Yes this is fine. It is standard practice in these new times."" So I went to my bank and wired the money. On Monday 5/4, I was speaking with my lender who told me that the title company will require me to bring the down payment money in the form of cashiers checks. I was confused as I had already wired the down payment money.  We soon discovered that the previously sent money was the result of a wire fraud scam. I immediately went to my bank and started a wire recall process and filed a complaint with the FBI and with the local police. On Thursday 5/7, I received notification from the bank that the money cannot be returned to me a it has been taken out of the other account.

A few important  things:

\-I obviously have the proof of the email exchange between me and my realtor. I also have a text where I say ""Hey. Forwarded you an email from the title company. Just want your blessing before I respond. A sanity check if you will"". He responded ""Yes sir. That's fine.""

\-When I received the email (asking me to wire the down payment) from what seemed like the title company, they had knowledge of my exact down payment amount which the actual title company would reveal to me, for the first time, a day later. This leads me to believe the title company had a data breach. Also, the email contained the email signature of the person I have been dealing with at the title company. 

\-I still want to close on the condo. The original closing date was Monday 5/4 but because of all this I was able to get it extended to Wednesday 5/13 to give me time to move funds around and sort things out. I'm not sure if proceeding with a lawsuit against the realtor and/or title company before the closing would affect the closing. I'm also not sure if me signing the closing documents and then filing a claim against either or both of these parties results in me losing some power. I cannot delay the closing much more because the sellers already bought another property with the expectation of having the funds from the sale of this property. I don't want to screw them over.

My questions are: Do I have a case against my realtor (for negligent advice) and/or title company (for being negligent about data protection)? If so, when should I sue? Before or after closing? The down payment was in the neighborhood of $13 K, FYI. I just want the original down payment back and have no interest in getting more money.

I believe their behaviors at least somewhat stem from their own childhoods (my mom's dad has PTSD and would take it out on her brothers, and my dad's stepmom was emotionally abusive.) Neither of them like to talk about their feelings, and will let negative emotions build up until they explode.

I don't want to take my siblings away from our parents, and I can't afford to take care of them, but I also think that my parents need to start dealing with their behavior/personal traumas, because I genuinely fear for my siblings' overall physical and mental health

82,Need help with kicking my uncle out.,1589145484,"Currently living in Cumberland County Tennessee. So my uncle (50) is freeloading off of my family and has been for nearly a year after my recently deceased mother, who spent upwards of 35,000$ on him in the past 3 years.

He is mentally handicapped and we have been told by his case worker that if we kick him out we will go to jail, but I'm not 100% sure of how actually true it is, and we've also had new developments. Currently I have 0 proof of any of this, but we have had things go missing, and when I've tried to track things that have disappeared, they aren't touched. So far we've had food, needles, medicine, plungers for needles, and small things that you won't miss at first disappearing.

The new development however is that my brother (24) went into his room this morning and the door was unlocked, and some of his things were thrown about the room, but none of his expensive things were touched. The door was locked, and there are only 3 people in the house. Myself, who was asleep, my step dad, who needs assistance to get in his wheelchair, and my uncle.

94,Split from partner and kicked out of house we own but I funded?,1589144114,"Hi there,

I have very recently gotten out of an emotionally abusive relationship, but I'm now in a bit of a pickle.

So we recently bought a house (in UK) where I fully funded the deposit and have paid for expensive updates on property (rewire and boiler) while he has redecorated.

We have a deed of trust in place such that upon sale of the property, I would get my deposit and extra back before equity would be split between us as 50/50 owners.

As a background, we bought the property nearer to where he worked and far from where I work with the hopes of me working from home. He naturally moved in first so it had become more his home and with his stuff, while I had minimum things there really. Then with COVID-19, I was able to move in full time and work from home but it made the situation worse and very difficult to live with and I had bounced between being there and at my mother's. 

Then when things went down, despite trying desperately to win me over, he ultimately said for me to pack my stuff and leave and I had to get my mother to pick me and my stuff up. I left without an issue as would have left anyway, but know that he doesn't have the right to have done that.

We pay mortgage and bills 50/50 but all bills are in my own name and he pays me which pays the bills. If he's worse than I believe him to be, he could always stop his standing order to me.

I've been in touch with my mortgage lender as I was hoping I could buy him out (though there is no equity so he's not due anything) but sadly would need to cough up a lot of cash to afford it on my own income despite KNOWING I could.

He also owes me £10k. I had him sign something before it fully kicked off to confirm it in writing.

I have reason to believe that he intends to try and make money out of me if he can, not that he will as I won't allow it. His mother is fortunately on side and wants to make sure I don't lose out. 

Just wondering what things you guys would consider doing that I haven't looked in to or done yet, or ways in which I can deal with the property and him?

0,"Restraining orders, eviction and mail",1589143583,"This is in California.  There's a bit of a family issue going on between a relative and their grandson.  Some backstory: the grandson was living with the grandparent, but there would frequently be clashes (on top of drug use and other fun stuff).  It came to a head one afternoon, when the grandparent asked for some of her belongings that were in the grandson's locked room (he was inside).  The grandson said to wait...and to wait....and to wait, eventually just ignoring and refusing access.  So the grandparent retrieved a screwdriver and began dismantling the doorknob.  This enraged the grandson, and he barged out of the room pushing her aside and destroyed her bedroom door by repeatedly punching it.  We tried to get him to leave, but he refused.  Law enforcement was called, but because he was living there, they couldn't do anything to make him leave.  However, one officer pulled the grandparent aside and said that if they were to file for a restraining order, upon serving it they could get him to leave.  The grandparent got a temporary restraining order (100 foot distance) and he left.  They have since gotten the formal order, which reduced the distance to a mere 6 feet, because legally he is still is able to reside there since no eviction process has taken place.  This formal order was very recently granted and hasn't been served to him yet.

Forward to a couple days ago.  The grandparent texts him and his girlfriend that he has mail, and that he also owes money for a cell phone bill he hasn't paid.  The girlfriend responded, and asked when she could pick up the mail.  The grandparent responded by saying anytime, and that they can also bring the money to pay the phone bill at that time.  The grandson misconstrued this as a threat to hold his mail hostage, so he contacted the police.  They showed up at around midnight and told the grandparent that it is a federal crime to withhold someone's mail, and to hand it over.  They did so without issue.

So the plan is to remove him from the cell phone account and see if there's any way his unpaid charges can go with it (doubtful, but worth a shot), and definitely to proceed with the eviction process, though the grandparent is (duly) concerned that when served the new restraining order, he will attempt to move back in.  In the interim, is she under any obligation to hold his mail for him?  Is she able to at least mark it ""*Return to sender. No longer at this address*"" and put it back out (after photographing it for CYA purposes)?

A few months later one of the cats started hanging out on our porch and wouldn't leave. He was/is missing more than half of his tail, had fleas, open sores on his body and a terrible wheeze/cough.

Eventually we decided to take him in. Over the next 3 months we took care of him, took him to the vets for his wheeze and wounds. On a number of occasions we would let him outside only for him to turn around and come back into the house. We allowed him to be able to leave whenever he wanted but he never left.

The neighbor would comment as to how ""healthy"" the cat is looking when she saw him on our front porch.

We found out the neighbhor had been evicted due to not paying rent on time (She told us this).

She turned up today claiming the cat - we said no. The cat was still in no condition to leave as he was still wheezing. We had a shouting match at the door and claiming that ""the cat has been living out here for 10 years!""
She tried to push past us to get into our house...

We told her that if she can prove she owns the cat then by all means we'll give him back.

Due to one of our airlines not yet making a decision about flights, we have given attendees the option to stay on for 2021 with an extra £15 cost, or drop out and get all of their money back except £15.

One of the attendees is unhappy with this, and has written an email asking for all their money back on the grounds that we have not ""fulfilled our agreement"". I believe that he is referring to his payment to us constituting a contract.

We've obviously not a holiday company, we're run by volunteers and we're now running the risk of being sued by this attendee (who has made a lot of trouble in the past, has a bit of a reputation).

23,Is a chargeback or other action warranted here?,1589141498,"Morning all, 

I hired a business ""coach"" (for $2k US per month) and during our initial call, I was under the impression he would be doing consulting AND marketing. When it came time to run ad campaigns he the said ""I meant I'd HELP you with marketing, but if you want us to set it up it's another charge.."" (an additional $1k per month)      - red flag #1

Last month I called him and said ""I'm not getting anything out of this and I'm still steamed about the extra charges I thought were included, so I'm canceling""

He's an NLP graduate and convinced me to stay on for 30 days more as ""we're so close"".

He's a young Australian, as are most of his clients (my friends) and one mentioned that he charges them $2000AUS while he's charging me $2000USD (a difference of \~$700 per month for the same exact service (we do group calls etc).

I called him to confront him about this ""why am I paying $700 more for the same thing ($4200 more over the course of the program)?

I got nothing out of working with this scammy guy and have been trying to let it go, but it's really bothering me that he refuses to refund me that partial month and that he was taking advantage of the currency situation and refuses to acknowledge it.

**In my eyes he charged me $2800 more ($700\*4month) + $500 (for marketing services not used) and refuses to acknowledge that he did anything wrong at all. So a $2000 chargeback seems fair to me.**

24,I'm pretty sure I'm being sabotaged.,1589141408,"I start off my by saying sorry if the flair to this post is misleading.

Anyway, I've been living in a small apartment complex for a couple of years now. Early last year my landlord told me he they were looking to sell the whole apartment complex by the end of 2019. He told me I should prepare for different management and to expect the monthly rent to increase. I thought to myself ""no problem if things get bad I'll just move out.""

A couple months after he told me that. He actually offered me the single apartment unit I had been living in for 45k. Again i thought to myself ""that's a steal."" Considering the fact that they were just remodeled. And were built in the late 90s. My landlord and I really got along. I've lived here for 5 years and never had any problem with him. So I think he sold it to me out of the kindness of his heart, but i could just be naive. 

So in late 2019 the majority of apartment units (46 out of 52 apts) get bought by new management. I'm assuming my previous landlord sold a couple other single apt units to his best renters, but I'm not sure. Well this is where it gets dicey. Right off the bat, the new landlord (we'll call him ""Bob"") knocks on my door and is curious if I'm willing to sell him my apartment unit. He shoots me with an offer of 48k. I politely rejected it and he seemed to understand. 

Everytime I see Bob around he's really respectful and always greets me, but it's all a facade. A couple of days after I rejected his offer. I wake up to the sound of running water. I rush to the restroom and see water dripping from the roof of my apartment. (I live downstairs. The apartment upstairs is vacant.) So I run  to Bobs office and tell him about the situation. He tells me he'll go turn it off in a couple of minutes. Naturally I run back to my apartment to clean the mess it's made. Bob never shows up. After 10 minutes I go back to his office only to see he's not there. His truck is gone from the parking lot. So i take matters into my own hands and went upstairs and shut if off( Literally all the sinks and showers were running). Now I got water damaged on my roof. Bob doesn't return for 3 days, I called him and he never answered. Finally when I did see him I confronted him about the situation and he claims ""he forgot, and that he wouldn't be able to fix my apartment unit because he doesn't own mine or the upstairs one either."" I go online to my city property records and see the upstairs apartment are indeed owned by the company that owns the majority of the apartments. I confront Bob about it and he makes up some BS excuse that it must be a mistake. 

Okay whatever I get it fixed pretty cheap and move on. I buy a security camera to see who exactly is going upstairs. And ironically the situation never occurred ever again. Next, one day I arrived from work to see a plastic ziploc bag on my doorstep. Inside it contained bottles of prescribed pills. I find it odd because no one else lives near me since most of the apartments are still vacant. (This happened right before I installed the camera.) As I'm on my way to the office to deliver them to Bob. I see him around a corner staring at me trying to hide from my sight. I confront him and tell him these pills were placed on my doorstep by ""accident."" He takes them from me and places them in the ""lost and found box."" Okay now I know something is going on. Why would he be looking at me mysteriously from around a corner? The next day he knocks again and offers me to move out for 50k. I dont budge though. I plan on renting the unit out after I pay it off. 

Next situation. Bob and his team of workers have been planting grass seeds in hopes of sprucing up the outside appearance of the apartments. So from time to time I see them watering certain patches of grass. Well, my A/C Unit is near one of those patches of grass. Its around the corner from my apartment so I have no view from the inside. Well one day I go to check my mailbox and on the way there, I see Bob literally pouring water into my A/C unit with a hose. Now I'm pissed. I confronted him yet again and ask why he's pouring water into my unit. He told me he wasn't trying to on purpose. He was ""watering the grass."" He was literally just holding the hose on top of my A/C unit. Another situation is they replaced all the mailboxes for no reason. Like they had just been replaced maybe 3-4 years ago. They told me I would have to pay $500 for the new key. Which is the most absurd thing I've ever heard.

Lastly(for now) Every weekend he parties with his team of labor workers but usually stop at 12am. Except yesterday.They continued all night. Finally at around 2am I called the cops because they were drunkenly singing and screaming in unison. The cops never showed up because my luck and town just suck balls. So I go out there and politely ask them to turn down the music. Which they did for about 45min. Then they huddled around my window all night talking nonsense and playing music off their phone. I called the cops multiple times and they told me they couldn't do anything if they didn't hear any loud noise when they showed up. This went on until 5am. To be honest I didn't want to go out there again, because I felt like they were being hostile the first time I told them to turn it down. I was outnumbered and outmuscled. Plus these idiots were drunk as hell and probably would've wanted to fight me. 

My point is, I believe they're sabotaging me so that I sell them my apartment. So far to my knowledge they've obtained 2 apartments using these tactics.
I didn't even want to post this because I hate claiming myself as a victim of a situation like this. But right now I can't help it. What can I do legally to mess with them? Or at least get them to leave me alone? I live in Texas btw if that helps.

Any info would be appreciated it!

(M) MS,1589140172,"For context I was going to welding school in MS, I told my program director a week before I actually gave written notice of dropping that I was being evicted and had to move back to NC. Due to corona virus I lost my job and couldn't find work, he tried to get me to stay and offer to get me jobs locally. Saying I could also take a LOA for up to 6 months but I'd have to come back to complete all the physical work.

 Nothing panned out, so I got in touch with financial aid 2 days before my written notice about how much of my loans had been dispersed and if anything would be returned because I couldn't actually get any of the hands on training that I paid to get for the last 2-3 months. She told me she couldn't give me this information and that id have to talk to my program director(this was all in an email). 

I get a call from the director later on telling me he doesnt know how much has been dispersed or if I'll get any refund but that the majority has already been paid out so i might as well stay and finish out the couple months. I asked how can that be when I haven't been in class for 2-3 months because of the virus?

I called back on 4/29 to tell my program director that I was dropping, he told me he needed written proof so he could submit it to his boss. I did, explaining my situation and choice to drop.

38,Medical aesthetics - misconduct,1589139757,"Hello! I believe I was wronged by a medical aesthetics company and I just wanted some opinions. I live in Alberta, Canada. 

Short story - I have some facial flushing and I went in for a consult at a high end place for some laser (non-invasive). The aesthetician was pushy and up sold me to custom resurfacing which was expensive but she was virtually guaranteeing I would see $2000 worth of difference for my money. 

I feel silly for falling for this. 

She did not discuss risks of the procedure barely at all. They knew I had a history of accutane use and therefore acne prone skin but did not tell me that a laser procedure was likely to exacerbate acne. Sure enough within a few weeks my previously clear skin started to break out. I brushed it off for a long time thinking it was just skin purging or something but it never went away and got worse and worse. It was resistant to 1st and 2nd line treatments and I now have the worst skin of my entire life and I am on accutane again which is an extremely harsh drug. 

If the risk of even a remote possibly of acne resurgence was discussed with me I would never have had this procedure. It wasn’t even the original procedure I went in for. 

Of course I signed a consent form but it is a little bit bare bones and as I understand it, that does not cover the pillars of informed consent. There was nothing about acne on it and no risks were explained to me other than it would take several days to heal and infection was a risk. 

I highly doubt I have enough to sue since medical associations are very rich and powerful but do I have anything here? Like just enough to get some sort of settlement? My money back??

I have reached out to the company and they basically pretended that my problem was that I was dissatisfied with my results when in reality my problem is that they acted unethically. They offered me additional treatments at cost but I just don’t feel that’s enough. 

I don’t know, am I overreacting? As anyone with bad skin knows it causes a tremendous hit to the self esteem and I’ve been really depressed. I just want them to acknowledge how bad they messed up but I don’t know if it was illegal.

42,[CA] We have a flea problem in our apartment. Our landlord is moving very slowly to fix it. What can we do?,1589139542,"My SO and I have lived in a small 1-bedroom apartment in California, in a fairly small building (6 units total), for a few years. About 6 months ago, we noticed fleas in our apartment. We have no pets and all hardwood/tile floors, but we thought at the time that the fleas were due to a friend's dog coming into our apartment one time for about 30 minutes. (We're now almost certain the dog visit was unrelated, for reasons laid out below.)

For about 4 months after that, the fleas appeared sporadically. We'd have a week with a lot of them, we'd vacuum and clean intensely, then we'd find none for about a week, then we'd see them again later. It's also worth pointing out that I never seem to get bit (or never notice getting bit), but my SO's bites swell up and itch instantly, so she's been miserable dealing with this for months.

Because we thought the dog visit was the original problem (and because that dog visit may have been against the rules of the building, though somewhat unclear), we paid to have a company come out and spray the apartment for fleas on our dime rather than bothering our landlords. We followed the instructions, picking up everything off of the floor except furniture and vacating the unit for 4 hours while they sprayed and let it dry. We saw no fleas for about 3 days, but after that they were back, despite the fact that we vacuumed thoroughly every day and emptied the canister in the dumpster outside immediately each time. We contacted the pest control company and had them come out and take another look. They confirmed that we still have fleas (and that they were actually fleas and not another insect), and after looking at our unit and the building, they said the likelihood was very high that there was a host or hosts elsewhere in the building. This could be rodents or other animals crawling into the openings under the building, or a cat or dog in another unit.

This is where we finally brought our landlords into the loop. The building owner lives in one of the units, and we see him around, but we're really supposed to go through the property management company for maintenance requests (though this was ambiguous -- the owner seemed to like us coming directly to him with these things in the past). The pest control company wrote me out an estimate for them to take care of potential rodents under the building, and asked me to give it to the property managers so they could contact him and pay to have it taken care of.

Here's an overview of what's happened since then (if you don't want details, you can skip these bullet points for a brief summary):

* I drove the estimate for the rodent service over to the property managers the next day, handed it to the secretary, told her it needed to go to our manager/rep and that work needed to be done on the building. This was about two months ago. A couple weeks later, I saw the building owner and asked if the property managers talked to him. Turns out, they didn't act on it at all. Didn't get work done, didn't talk to the owner about it at all.
* The owner originally said he would ""take care of it."" To him, this meant using some expanding foam stuff to block one of the places where animals could get in and out under the building. Others were still wide open. In the meantime, we're still getting fleas, my SO was still getting bit, we were vacuuming, setting out flea traps, dealing with this every day and it was only getting worse.
* About a month ago, I run into the owner outside and tell him the problem is worse than ever. He says he'll talk to the pest control company they use (a different one than who I hired previously) and have him ""come out and take a look."" I tell him that's fine. A few days later, he knocks on my door at 7pm to tell us the pest control guy is gonna come by the next day at 9am. I would have sworn he said it was just to ""take a look"" at the problem, which I expected meant the rodents moving in and out of the building. Come 8:45 AM, he knocks on the door and wants to make sure I'm ready to have them come in and spray, meaning we'd have to be out of the unit for 4 hours. This was not what we discussed at all. Keep in mind, COVID was in full swing at this point. My SO is in college and works part-time, and I work full time in a job that's almost entirely work-from-home now. We can't just leave for 4 hours without planning. Where would we go? The owner responds with ""I don't know why that's so hard,"" makes me feel bad his possibly having to pay the pest control company for a missed appointment. Regardless, the pest control guy arrives, we look around the building and start talking about potential solutions. The owner insists ""there's nothing living under the building,"" despite the pest control guy looking directly at the openings and telling him ""that's wide open, it totally makes sense for animals to come in and out of there.""
* About 2.5 weeks ago, we find a good time for the pest control folks to come and spray when we can be out of the unit for 4 hours. It's the same dude from the company who was here before, so he looks inside, we talk, seem to be on the same page. After this second spray (the first one the landlords pay for), we see no decrease in the number of fleas. There are *always* fleas in the toilet, most of them seem to be in the bathroom but we notice them in almost every part of our small apartment, still vacuuming every day and emptying the canister outside.
* I call the property managers multiple times to tell them there's still a problem, with no response for a couple days. During this time, my SO and I notice that the unit above us is vacuuming far more often than the usually do. I go up and ask them if they have fleas. Turns out, they do! They also have no pets, all hardwood and tile, and had been getting bit for about a week. I ask them to contact the property managers.
* Property managers finally get back to us (this is about a week ago now). They tell me the upstairs unit is getting sprayed the next day. That's too soon for us to plan with our employers to be at work, but they have the pest control company call us directly to plan something a few days down the road. While I'm on the phone with the pest control company, I ask them what the next step would be if spraying in our apartment doesn't help at all, despite having no pets. Their response is something along the lines of: ""You'll have to talk to your property managers about that. We've discussed recommendations with them for other service to the building, but I can't give you specifics."" In other words, they've told our property managers what else they need to pay for to fix things, and they've done none of it. Around this time, the building owner used the foam stuff to block another opening to under the building, but there are at least three other places I'm sure a rat could fit into.
* On Friday, the pest control dude (same dude as before) came by to spray yet again. I talked with him for a bit before leaving. I asked, if this didn't work (again), what would be the next step for the building? He didn't have a good answer. He said there could be a pet somewhere in the building, or it could be rodents under the building, but they can't spray around the building on the outside, that wouldn't help. He said he would talk with his people again and give his recommendations to the property managers. So far, it seems there are fewer fleas than before, but they're still absolutely there. Three sprays total, two of which were paid for by the property managers, and all signs point to the fleas being back to their previous numbers in the apartment in a few days, just after another spray and after nearly a month of thoroughly daily cleaning and vacuuming.
* Yesterday, we ran into the building owner on the way back from the pharmacy. He informed us that according to the pest control company, who told the property managers, who told him (but not us directly), they wouldn't honor a warranty on the spray if the fleas were still there because I didn't move our furniture out of the way of all of the baseboards. This was never communicated to me (in fact, they specifically said we didn't have to move furniture), and while I'm not the one paying for it anymore, they clearly told me this as a way to make me think that it's my fault if we still have fleas, which at this point is beyond absurd. He also posited that maybe the fleas were ""airborne"" and jumping to our building from the one next door, where some tenants have cats. Because that's totally rational.

The bottom line is: as of yesterday, our building owner was telling us that he wants us to be ""comfortable"" and doesn't want us to leave, while still strongly implying that none of this was their fault and that we weren't doing enough to ensure that the fleas would actually be gone. He frequently asks us if we're harboring an animal, even though we're absolutely not. (I haven't informed anyone that we did have that dog visit once, for 30 minutes, 6 months ago, because it should be painfully obvious that the problem had nothing to do with that, and yet somehow I don't think they would respond well to hearing about that.) I informed them that my SO is in pain, with dozens of bites on her legs and thighs and no end to the problem in sight, and they seem to be responding by telling me that if spraying my apartment doesn't cause them to go away, they there's just no way to fix the problem. I also informed them that we have a few weeks more of this before we're gonna move out and find somewhere else to live, but we've been looking and it's extremely slim pickings in our area right now, for obvious reasons. Also, I would feel awful if someone else moved into this apartment and had to deal with this problem, along with a property management company that has no interest in fixing it.

What are my options here? In California, if our apartment has a flea infestation and it's not our fault, aren't they legally responsible for fixing it? Is there any way I could contact the city or the county to force them to actually do something about it? If they just keep blaming us for not ""following the rules"" of the flea spray service, despite not being told about them in the first place, do we have no recourse? And if we do end up moving out and living somewhere without a flea infestation, how can I hold their feet to the fire to ensure that no one else has to deal with this awful problem? (Also, if folks have experience with pest control and dealing with fleas, if we've been sprayed 3 times in 2 months, vacuumed and emptied outside every day, is it still normal to keep seeing fleas all over? Is having some of the baseboards covered really the problem? How are fleas getting in our toilet just minutes after we flush it and see it void of fleas??)

Thank you in advance!

**Edit:** One other question: I've heard that in California you need to give 30 days notice before vacating a unit if the lease is month to month, which ours is. I've also heard that you don't need to give *any* notice if your landlord fails to fulfill legal responsibilities affecting our health and safety as tenants. Would that apply here? Do we need to meet a burden of proof if we leave in fewer than 30 days?

47,Landlord Called ACS. They're trying to retaliate. What can I do?,1589138937,"The landlord for my residence is trying to make a life for my family a living nightmare.

**MAIN POINTS:**

* We do not have heat in our home.
* We have an open case in housing court for **not having heat in the home**.
* We are not paying the rent. My family and the kids are freezing!
* The landlord has not installed the heating tank purchased by the city of New York.
* New York State has issued a violation to the landlord.
* The landlord reported my family to ACS for child abuse.
* The head of the household is in the hospital.

**We're not receiving heat.** The two-family home is not receiving heat. During the winter, everyone at home sleeps in the cold. We brought it to their attention two years ago and there was no outcome. During winter 2019, we had enough. We called New York City 311 hotline and reported that we do not have heat. A week later, the city of New York came by to the home and inspected the location. **The landlord received a violation** and a case was started in New York City's housing court.

Because of not having any heat, we refused to pay the rent until the issue is resolved. The court ordered the landlord to fix the property so that heat can be provided to the house. But because of the expensive cost, they have not done so. At the second court hearing, the court questioned each of us and we were honest with our responses. The court ordered the state to purchase the heating tank for the landlord and it was delivered. All that needs to happen is the landlord should install the tank. 

**Still, to this day, the tank has not been installed**. The landlord received a violation (which I believe is a really expensive bill from New York State).

The court asked us if we plan on moving. And we said, yes, but it's hard finding a home right now because of the coronavirus pandemic and the law that's in place to not evict anyone.

Recently, we were visited by ACS. They received a report from someone at the location who reported a case of child abuse. The investigator started a case and visited the home. All the kids at home were stripped searched. The investigator said, ""Wow, there's no abuse on these kids. None, whatsoever."" She searched all of our rooms, our refrigerator, and also searched the bathroom. When the investigator opened our refrigerator, she said, ""You guys have more food than I do, this house is stocked!"" Then, she started to interview each of my children and question them. Then, the adults were asked a few questions separately. We expect this case to be closed out.

The landlord lives in the same building. She occupies the top level and my family and I occupy the first floor. 

Today, the head of the household had to go to the hospital because of shortness of breath. The doctor said that her blood pressure is high she needs fluids because of dehydration. She's at the hospital getting help. The doctor will not rule out ""stress."" But the doctor says, ""This could be due to  stress.""

**I want to file a lawsuit for emotional distress and abuse** **and have the court issue a protective order to prevent the landlord from continuous retaliation**. We plan to find a home to move into and move out of this mess by NOVEMBER or sooner. We are actively looking to get out. And I **refuse** to pay the rent.

51,Tenant Rights in Florida during home repairs,1589138375,"Hello! I am a fairly new reddit user so I'm sorry if I do anything wrong here but I have a legal question about tenant rights and couldn't find a solid answer on Google.

I live in a four-unit apartment building in Florida. Recently my neighbor in the building told me that a plumber had found a leak. Today, I received a call from a plumber informing me that they are coming at 9 AM on Tuesday and will be completely gutting the only bathroom in my unit, removing the toilet and all of the flooring, and there will be no running water in the building, but they plan to have the plumbing fully repaired within 24 hours. 

Under normal circumstances this would be annoying, but my partner and I are both employed with a local university, and I am a grad student, so we would likely just spend the day on campus. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, we can't access our offices or any of the spaces on campus. We both have to work from home, and spend almost all day on Zoom. My partner has IBS, and really can't be without a functioning toilet. My partner is  immunocompromised so we don't feel comfortable going to a public place right now, and even if we *did* feel comfortable there really isn't anywhere open where we could go. 

My question is: Does our landlord have any legal responsibility to provide us with a safe space to be during the repairs? What if the repairs take longer than 24 hours? Does the pandemic change anything? We have not received any communication from our property manager, and we want to reach out to her and ask for accommodations, but we want to know what our rights are in this circumstance. We're very stressed and we need a quiet and safe place with a functioning bathroom. We're also fairly low income / I am a student, so we can't afford to rent a hotel room or hire a lawyer for something like this.

You run a hotel, which is open to the public, out of a pretty building on a public street? Guess what, people are going to take pictures. Deal with it. 

This is a question about legality. 

There’s a beautiful old motel in Los Angeles. It also has a cool restaurant on the premises. They have gone to great lengths to make these buildings era authentic and aesthetically pleasing. They rent them out for movie shoots as well. To be clear, they’re on a very busy road in an area with other businesses and shops, and are on the edge of a residential neighborhood. This is not a ‘hidden gem’ or anything. We’re talking plain site on a heavily trafficked road in Los Angeles. 

People like to walk across the street and take photographs of the building. Of course they do. Yet the owners have NO PHOTOGRAPHY signs up all over the property, and have been known to come out and scream at anyone taking photos of the building. 

My question is, what does the law say here? I’m of the opinion that the owners should be told to fuck off by everyone taking photos, but I’d like to know my rights before I take this step. 

Here are the important details. I’m across the street on a public sidewalk and not on their property at all. I’m legally parked. I’m not obstructing anyone or anything. I am not being paid to take this photo, nor am I attempting to sell this photo.

55,California / Bay Area stay at home order: Am I allowed to leave the United States?,1589138141,"I'm a permanent resident in the United States and I still own condos in both places (my home country and the United States) that are otherwise empty so I can use them at any time. Given that the Bay Area is particularly strict with lockdown measures and that the measures in California don't seem to have a strong effect (the case numbers are still increasing) I'm considering leaving the country for a few months until the whole situation here hopefully gets better (my home country is very close to completely eliminating Covid-19 and there are only very few restrictions on daily life).

What I'm unclear about is if I'm currently allowed to leave the United States and if that would put my status as permanent resident into jeopardy. I'd still be keeping my employment in the United States (working remotely), my condo, my car, and all the other things. Also my domestic partner is a United States citizen.

The [California Public Health Order](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/SHO%20Order%205-7-2020.pdf) order says:

&gt; Californians should not travel significant distances and should stay close to home.

What is the meaning of ""should"" here? Is that just a suggestion, or does it have any legal consequences?

The [San Francisco Shelter in Place order](https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/files/HealthOfficerOrder-C19-07b-ShelterInPlace-03312020.pdf) says:

&gt; All travel, including, but not limited to, travel on foot, bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit, except Essential Travel, as defined below in Section 13.i, is prohibited. People may use public transit only for purposes of performing Essential Activities or to travel to and from work to operate Essential Businesses, maintain Essential Governmental Functions, or to perform Minimum Basic Operations at non-essential businesses. Transit agencies and people riding on public transit must comply with Social Distancing Requirements, as defined in Section 13.k, to the greatest extent feasible. This Order allows travel into or out of the County only to perform Essential Activities, operate Essential Businesses, maintain Essential Governmental Functions, or perform Minimum Basic Operations at non-essential businesses.

It appears that the Shelter in Place order doesn't allow me to leave the county, so flying to a different country doesn't seem to be an option either. The only potential exception that I would see is:

&gt; Travel related to the provision of or access to Essential Activities, Essential Governmental Functions, Essential Businesses, or Minimum Basic Operations;

Hey all,

Back in January I went in for a colonoscopy, under order from my GI. Before the procedure I called the hospital to confirm they were still in network for my plan (Anthem PPO). They told me they were, and confirmed my amount due after insurance would be \~$670.

Day of procedure they make me pay a $175 deposit and tell me they will collect the rest once insurance is settled. Procedure happens, bill is submitted, wait a few weeks and the claim is denied. I call hospital and they say they will talk to insurance and resubmit. A month later I check in, and the resubmitted claim has also been denied.

At this point I call Anthem and they tell me the hospital is not coding the procedure properly. On guidance of the Anthem CSR I spoke with, I file formal appeals with Anthem for the rejected claims. Note, through all of this, the hospital is not updating my amount due on my online account as they say they are waiting for the insurance to approve it.

Well, now almost 4 months after the procedure, my hospital billing account is showing I owe them \~$7500. I am calling Anthem again tomorrow to see what the deal is, but I'm pretty frustrated I have to go through with this based on the hospitals lack of ability to code this properly. At best I see it as incompetence and at worst I see it as a way to try and get more than the negotiated rates used with Anthem by billing me the full balance directly. 

Throughout all of this my insurance company has been pretty great (minus rejecting the claims); the people I speak with their seem knowledgeable and confident this will get resolved. Meanwhile when I call the hospital it is impossible to get someone on the phone who knows what they are talking about or cares.

Any advice from Reddit on how I can get this resolved?",legaladvice,False,citizentome,/r/legaladvice/comments/gh7aac/hospital_preapproved_procedure_with_insurance_now/

Ok guys, I need some help here.

Me (19) and my boyfriend (19) are trying to get his sister (16) who turns 17 on the 1st of June, out of her dad's house.

We are well aware that her dad could call the police and feign kidnapping, or she could be brought back as a runaway. Her dad is an alcoholic and has been since BF was about 8 years old. He mentally abuses her and threatens physical violence almost daily. So far he hasn't touched her, and we're both glad for that. He has also, very recently, threatened suicide.

He threatened to off himself with her in the house. If he had done it, she would have been there to hear it, possibly even see it happen. They (her dad and grandmother) call her fat, lazy, ugly and have even said that she was abusing them by ""eating all of their food and leaving them nothing."" Her grandmother even forced her to weigh herself to prove she was fat. Mind you her dad is around 41 years old and he acts like a middle school bully.

She's constantly stressed out and scared to live there or be around her father. She doesn't want CPS involved because they might not let her go with my BF. She does self-harm and has attempted suicide 3 times in the last year because of her father. She also can't see a therapist because of him, ad he won't take her and refuses to pay for one.

We are trying everything we can right now to find an apartment and move him out to live with us. We're afraid that her dad will start hitting her sometime in the future, and we are trying to avoid any more abuse. She can't handle another year in that house, with the abuse getting worse by the week.

I really need advice ASAP! We need to know what we can do legally to get her out of the house so he can't use police to drag her back. Emancipation would take far too long and we can't get him to sign a document stating he allows her to leave. As he constantly takes her phone (that my BF bought her) she is unable to record almost anything he does to her.

So I got a signed agreement that our 3 year old son lives equally with her and me in changing 3 day intervalls. She signed it without pressure and I had the document checked by a lawyer beforehand so it will hold up in court. We both got custody and only live ~5km away from each other.

Now all of a sudden she‘s acting up that she won’t stick to our agreement anymore and basically is telling me she wants custody for her. If that‘d be in our sons best interest I would do everything necessary to fulfill his needs but as far as I’m concerned she‘s doing it cause she gets less money out of me if we keep the agreement up and she‘s petty cause I started dating a friend of hers. So basically that’s her way of having revenge on me. 
As far as our son is concerned he, at least in my opinion, likes how things are going at the moment. In his words this is really cool cause he has 2 rooms twice as much stuff to play with and 2 homes. 
Also, she‘s been fighting bulimia and depression for more than a decade and in my honest opinion isn‘t fit to be a mother 24/7 if one of her bulimia attacks kick in.

employed at a company I’ll be taking over in the next 5 years and am doing everything to make sure our son has a great time every time he‘s with me.

Our company in the midst of all this decided to transfer a bunch of upper level managers around our district. One came from a location where a bunch of people had self quarantined and were showing signs of the virus. (There is a documentation for this as a bunch of people blew the whistle on our DM for doing so)

Again nobody has show visible symptoms and I even tested negative for the swab test but an immediate family member who hasn’t left the house during this somehow contracted the virus. It is entirely possible I’m asymptomatic and never showed signs. Our company is also cheating with our payroll. We are supposed to be scheduling 500 hours for sanitation but what the manager is forcing departments to do is just changing worker titles to sanitizers and they’re still just doing their regular jobs and not really sanitizing.

I accepted a job offer in mid-January of 2020 in my home state of Pennsylvania and the company wanted me to start training the next month. The company is two hours away from my hometown, so naturally my family and I had to go hunting for my first apartment.

A few days later we started taking tours of potential places, explaining to the landlords why I needed to move in so quickly and so on. One of the tours showed us the complex’s package room. This is where all the packages are placed for tenants to pick up at their leisure. As one of the landlords (there are two, but only one gave us a tour) explained the room’s function, I noticed a package for Room 535. This is the same room the landlord told me I would be moving into, as the previous tenant was no longer there. It was completely vacant. I pointed this oddity out to him and sheepishly replied “Oh...that’s weird, that shouldn’t really be there.” Despite this, it was my best option so I put a down payment on the apartment that same day. Two weeks later (mid-February at this point), I officially moved in.

It’s been almost three months since then and the package from the previous tenant is still in the package room. I’ve told the landlords about this, saying that the package isn’t mine, it’s clearly labeled for someone else, I even pointed it out on our tour, so on and so forth. They said they would take care of it, but it’s still there. A few days ago they even sent me an email that said, “The number of packages received daily has increased significantly...we ask that you please retrieve your packages in a timely manner.”

I’m also very certain that the previous owner is not going to come and get it. I believe this not only because of COVID-19, but two days after moving in I got a letter from the IRS in my mailbox addressed to the previous tenant.

1,Microcenter Warranty Question (Stickers US Law / Computer Hardware),1589134441,"Conversation with Microcenter https://imgur.com/a/rCpwbSt

Edit: Purchased in Fairfax Virginia, current resident of Michigan, living in Maryland (Military)

I am curious what would be my best path forward.

I purchased a product that I want to open for various reasons (desire, general purpose cleaning, thermal paste reapplication) and have been told that the sole absence of a ""Warranty Void if Removed"" sticker would invalidate the additional warranty I purchased directly through the retailer (Microcenter).

This warranty is often presented as a ""no questions asked"" type of warranty .

Regardless of the particulars of the warranty, can a US vendor invalidate a warranty solely based on the absence of said sticker.

I included a digitaltimes article referencing the FCC warning letters to companies regarding these stickers as well as to be sure to clarify that the sole absence was enough.

As a follow-up question, is there anything I can do it after pushing back they say they would allow the absence of the sticker but not a change of thermal paste.

This would be akin to Ford saying you can take off your oil filter and put it back on if you like, but you can't change your oil.

I live in the United States and am undocumented (I am working on getting my residency though). I've been living in a place with my husband (who is a citizen), we have 2 children that are still under the age of 18. A while ago (like 5 years, give or take) my husband's son, who is about 30 years of age (who he had with another woman before we met) had gotten out of jail and needed a place to stay. He had been staying with his mother beforehand, but for some reason they decided they didn't want him to stay there anymore, so he just showed up at our house. My husband, obviously trying to care for his son, let him stay at our house. Everything was fine until he brought his ""girlfriend"" and his dog to also stay at our house and then started taking illegal drugs inside of our house (he admitted to doing so) and if that wasn't enough he apparently had schizophrenia (i don't know if he was ever actually diagnosed, but I don't doubt it, given he is a drug addict) and would frequently have manic scenes where he'd break stuff and yell at us. We've had to call the police a number of times on him because of this. He's been living in our property ever since without ever paying any money in the slightest, he's now living in the garage because we just couldn't handle keeping him inside.

At this point I'm tired of it, and reasonably so, but I don't know what I can really do legally to just get him far away from my family, especially my children. My name isn't on the house documents and I've tried restlessly to talk with my husband about this, but I just cannot convince my husband to take him elsewhere. I don't really want to leave my house either because I feel like it's unfair for me to have to do that when the only problem here is his son. It's like I'm completely powerless in this situation.

Our neighbours loved the previous owners and were very good friends, they mention it all the time. 

About a year in, they approach us saying that our fence is 6 inches in to their yard and they’d like it moved / rebuilt sometime. They had mentioned it to the previous owner who just left the fence as is (our neighbour says previous owner couldn’t afford to move it so they let it go).

Fast forward to now. After not mentioning the fence since that first time they are now going hard on the issue ‘we will help’ ‘we notice you’re not on that side, might as well do it now’ ‘materials are cheap’ etc.

My questions are:
Should the fence have been disclosed at time of purchase? (Were previous owners legally obligated to tell us if they knew?)

Am I legally obligated to move it? (I believe the first step will be to have the property line surveyed... and if the fence is over and they’re still crying over these inches, I’m willing to do it. Just really don’t have the desire to with the way they’ve approached it)

7,Online template to release tenant from all liability from rental agreement?,1589133693,"Location: Michigan

Does anybody know where I can find a template that would release one tenant from liability on a rental agreement?  Long story short, my stepdaughter has left her abusive bf. She's been living in house with him and 2 others (4 people total),  She left the house shortly before an eviction was started on the other 3. The landlord, being sympathetic towards my step daughter, told her she would not be held liable for any of the outstanding rent or other charges incurred by the other 3, and gave her a form to sign. However, the way the form is written, it says nothing about releasing her from liability. It has the usual language about all tenants being ""jointly and severally liable"". I told her not to sign it, but to instead have the LL sign a document that specifically states that she is released from all liability on the lease agreement.

I've looked online for a template of this, but I'm having no luck. Does anyone know where I can find something like this? Or just a generic liability release?

I was active duty up until 2014 and I was a Illinois resident because that is where I entered the service.

13,City Employer Warning if I Don’t Consider Open Position,1589133033,"I work for a city government as an on-call employee. Within the division I’m employed with, I work several positions and upwards of 30-35 hours a week (my on-call threshold is 39 hours maximum a week.) Due to COVID-19, I’ve been furloughed until our facilities can reopen, and am currently claiming unemployment to keep financially stable.

Recently, the city sent notification to all employees that a couple of emergency positions had opened, temporary on-call positions within shelters and prisons. My primary duties in my regular employment pertain to child care and customer service, far from what these new positions seem to require or would necessitate. I appreciate that the city reached out to their on-calls to offer these positions, but thought no more on them as I did not feel I would serve either position best.

This morning I received a text informing that I should, “Please consider the open opportunity to continue [my] on-call employment with the city.”

This immediately struck me as quite ridiculous and forceful, at the same time an obvious indication of desperation to fill the position; I believe it’s the position within the prison, which I feel particularly uncomfortable applying for. I am a dedicated employee, highly regarded not in my own opinion but as evident by my job titles, responsibilities training new employees and leading program engagement, and reliance on by my immediate superiors.

My great concern though, if you’ve stuck with me this long, is whether I can actually be removed from employment for not actively engaging with this job offer? 

There are several things I think I understand about the situation: obviously this is a very unstable and desperate time for all of us, and necessary that we all do our part to support our communities and come through this. And there is reverence for those that continue to work, on the front lines, sacrificing their safety and comfort and health to take care of others, that’s an immense sacrifice. And I certainly am not one who simply doesn’t want to work, would rather be making bank on unemployment - I am itching for the day I can be back at work, in my programs, doing what I do within my community. However, I feel the city that employs me is singling out their on-call employees, without consideration for our skills or work prior to shutdown, and it feels very threatening that should we feel we could not serve those offered positions as best as possible, having considered them and found we can’t operate safely or affectively in them, that’s essentially a resignation letter. Can they do that, can they hold my job hostage if I don’t apply for this other job? It’s really making me question my dedication to my employer, I don’t want to feel like a mule being led by carrot to something I am not prepared to do.

I’m just gonna put a good ol TW here to be safe. 
Now into the post:


Their older sibling sexually abused them when they were a child. The older sibling continues to harass my friend now, but my friend does their best to ignore it. It is not physical abuse at this point, but my friend has trauma from it, stemming from a childhood event. 

This friend can’t talk to anyone about it because, in their words, because:

A) they have no certifiable proof. 

B) their parents are uptight, so they fear the repercussions of any call to any organization. 

C) the older sibling can deny everything, and would be more believable, as my friend has a history of mental health issues (depression and anxiety). Their family tends to favor the other siblings as well, due to gender. 

I realize it sounds like my friend could be making this up, but I fully believe them. 

My question is, is there any way I can help her? Is there a way that they can move out, or anything? They live with the older sibling, so I want to help them get out of that household, but she doesn’t turn 18 for another year.

22,"USA:NC Housing laws, squatters, etc",1589131403,"Greetings - 

I am on the hunt for a direction to head to for research. 

My friend, Z, has a house in their name in North Carolina. It was purchased and then quitclaim deeded to Z. Z does not currently live in NC. Since leaving, Z has solely paid  the property taxes  and just recently started the home owners insurance on it.  Z's parent and Z's siblings live in the home. There is no paperwork between Z and their parent.  The parent works under the assumption that it is their home to do with as they please. One adult sibling is on SSI and can not live on their own. There is another adult sibling in the house that could leave at any time if they chose. Here are my questions:

1.) Is the parent actually a squatter in Z's home? What rights does this give them?

2.) If the parent invites another adult to live with them, how long do they have to stay to have ""legal"" rights to stay in the home?

3.) If the parent passes while the guest is still there, how long does Z have to call the sheriff?

4.) What other things does Z need to be concerned about? (We're already aware of the damage angle possibilities.)


This young person Z already has the weight of the world on their shoulders and I'd like to lift a little if I can. There is also massive enmeshment between Z and the parent. Any answers would be fantastic and links to websites would be great too.

I have a case number, but I really feel like this girl skated on a potentially serious situation and now I’m worried that I will have to pay for damage to my truck.



Edit: This happened in Fort Myers, Florida



While sitting on the back porch with my roommate B, we both heard the unmistakable sound of a car crashing into another car.

We both came out the front door in time to see a white/beige Ford Edge backing away from the scene. After I watched the car park in the visitor parking area of my street, I took a few pictures of the front passenger side of my truck.

We then went over to the visitor parking to have a conversation with the girl (who was now out of her car and walking towards the scene, maybe to the house she was visiting). As soon as we approached it was very clear that the she was drunk, smelled of alcohol and having difficulty standing up straight. The girl stammered and gave me a fake name when asked who she was, but would not provide a drivers license. She said she was visiting a friend and that she lived in the next town over when asked if she was from the community. I asked her for some contact information, and when I tried to call the number she gave it did not go through. So I gave her my number which she tried to call from a hidden number. 

I then took pictures of her car and license plate, and told her that I will be calling the police after feeling as though she was being dishonest.

Once on the phone with the 911 operator she then ran back to her car and fled from the scene.

I was still in the phone with the operator and informed her that the person who hit my car was fleeing. I gave the plate number, description and where the driver was heading.

We were then instructed to wait for an officer to arrive. 

When the officer (a) did arrive, he seemed to not care at all about the situation, extremely lethargic and not helpful. He asked me to email him my account of the situation after going over it a few times with him. About 10 minutes later, the girl was found about 5 miles down the road and the officer (a) with us left to go help with the stop.

The officer (b) who stopped the girl came to pick up me and B to make an ID. On the way there he told us it was pretty obvious the girl was drunk, and that she was driving on a suspended license. 

After making a positive ID, we had to give written accounts of the situation. Meanwhile, the girl was given a field sobriety test. Watching from 50 yards, it was extremely clear to me, B and the officer (b) with us that the girl was not only having trouble standing up and walking, but she was falling on the officer (a) giving the test. It was clear she was flirting with him and it appeared he was flirting back.

The officer (a) came over and said she dispelled reason that she was drunk, and that she was fine to drive home. She would be given a summons to court for the hit and run, and driving on a suspended license. The officer (b) with us asked why she wasn’t in cuffs, and the officer who did the test said that “Lee County is not arresting for that at this time”.

I find it hard to believe that a drunk driver could hit and run on a suspended license, and be allowed to drive home.

This might sound rather arbitrary, but it's a genuine question I have. If I'm in a longstanding relationship with a woman I  love; can I ""marry"" her without the paperwork and get in any sort of legal trouble for it?

I'd want to be married in every other regard. It literally would be a marriage...proposal, vows, ceremony (unofficial but we'd just treat it like a regular wedding), and socially claim to be married. To me, it seems just as important and valid as a marriage without the papers (vows are vows). Of course, I realize we don't get the benefits of marriage either but for me keeping our finances separate is essentially what allows me to live since I'm self-employed. I'm in MN (US).

If it weren't for the US healthcare system, I'd happily marry this woman on paper too. I just have chronic conditions that I need managed and if we tied the knot legally my income wouldn't nearly cover my medical insurance on the lowest tier. What I have now is income-based, reliable, and relatively affordable so I can manage my stress levels.

We file separate taxes and have separate accounts (we just reimburse one another and keep spending even) and our only joint venture might be a home in the future. We've discussed that I'd get it in the event of a split as I'd be paying the majority of it and my business will rely heavily on it. We are adamantly opposed to having children so that is not an issue either.

We'd continue to keep things separate even after a ceremony and would never refer to ourselves as married on paper. She would probably change her last name to mine though.

He has been obsessed with her for over 6 years and I am really worried about her wellbeing with this man around.

Both accounts have had multiple reports filed against them and even his main account but to no avail. He just keeps making new ones and coming back. Seriously what can we do about this? I am more worried for her safety, it is obvious that this guy is not all there mentally considering he spends hours and hours on end posting on these accounts. What can we do? Can instagram IP ban him? Thank you so much.

I absently thought her debt would get gobbled up by future returns, and we never really discussed it much. Asshole move on my part, certainly. 

Now she and her partner wish to buy a home and this debt is causing problems for her.

A few years later, she says the debt has ballooned to $10,000. She got tangled up and missed payments, it appears.

I want to make this right and eliminate her debt.

This is about a retail job. My manager and I have always had a rough relationship. He’s a jerk. I have self esteem. 

I’ve been off since March because I was sick (not with covid, thankfully) and I was supposed to start back on Wednesday. So I rolled up at 7am and started to ask questions. Mostly “hey, how are you keeping us safe.” I confessed that I’d been anxious about going back (he knows I have severe anxiety, but he thinks it’s not real). 

He got hateful (granted, he was already pissed that I was wearing a mask, because no one else was) and said “If you don’t want this job then leave.”

So I left. 

Now what? 

Was I fired? Did I quit? It’s been four days and I’ve heard nothing from them.

Long story short, sewage leak in our house. The first time was when we first moved in, and we cleaned it up ourselves. 

Second time it happened the real estate said they'd fix it, got plumber to clear pipes.

Happened again for a third time, same response from the real estate. We were pretty fed up at this point and asked about swapping residencies, because we weren't fans of ecoli poisoning. 

They said it'd be a break lease and we'd need to pay all costs for advertisement etc

We had the council take a look at our plumbing as suggested by our tenancy union who we had called looking for advice on the matter. They advised the owners to relocate an overflow outside.

We also let the real estate know about the sewage going underneath the lino in the laundry where it was leaking.

They claimed it was dry underneath so we checked. 
It wasn't. it was wet and mouldy from sewage water.
We had the pipes cleared yet again and was told it wouldn't block again.

They sent a handyman around to take the lino and clean it.
Also had some workers come to look at digging out some trees which roots were contributing to the blockage.


Tonight, our toilet blocked and the pipe leaked sewerage for the fourth time.

We're honestly sick to death of sleeping elsewhere because our downstairs laundry reeks of our own shit and piss. We're sick of plumbers rocking up without notice, trapsing their shit-sucking machines through our bedroom, into the ensuite and leaving faeces on the floor, sick of bitchy real estate agents being rude and reluctant to fix the situation, and sick of the owners that are basically silent on the matter.

70,I Need To Save My Mom From an Abuser,1589125453,"Not sure if this is the place to do this, but I can't think of anywhere else to ask. All of this is taking place in North Dakota (ND)

A few years ago, my mom started dating this guy, who I'll call Jack (nowhere near his real name). I knew from the get go something wasn't right about him, but I kept my mouth shut, because he made my mom happy. Over time, however, I learned enough to confirm my fears.

- Jack has a felony change on his background. I'm not fully sure for what, but he does have a Parol Officer he must still speak to. I do not know how to get in contact with his PO.

- Jack is not allowed to have alcohol, medication that is not prescribed, or any substances similar to either in his house, on him, or on anyone he interacts with. If he is caught, this will violate his parol.

- Jack is smart with technology. I am not fully sure what he has done to my mother's phone (the only phone she has assess to) but he knows exactly what she does on it, where she goes as long as the phone is on her, and has more than once called her out for doing things he tells her 'is not okay'.

- Jack is an amazing liar. I've seen him smooth talk to my grandparents, lying about what he has been up to. Because I'm considered 'alright' in his book, he generally tells me what's really going on, and my mother can confirm more often than not.

- Jack can, and has, lashed out for really stupid things before. I've seen him angry, he throw things and tries to pin the blame on anyone but himself. He's tried this with both me and my mom. While I can stand up for myself and call him out on his crap, my mom can't. She has tried and failed multiple times, and I'm the one who normally helps her out in these situations.

By the time I got to know this guy, it was almost impossible to talk to my mom about him. She was in denial about him and what he's doing. However, in the time she was dating him, she became a horrible alcoholic. She would always call me and cry in her drunken state talking about how horrible everything was. Eventually, my mom and Jack moved halfway across the state, as Jack was offered a once-in-a-lifetime job. They packed up and took off, telling only a handful of people.

Today, I called my mom to wish her a happy Mother's Day, only for the call to start with her sobbing uncontrollably. She was begging me to come get her, to take her away. Jack has been abusing her. In what way, she didn't say. But she did tell me she was scared, and desperate to get away. She said she was willing to leave everything behind, including her personal belongs, important documents, and all of mine and my brother childhood photos. 

I told her she needs to call the police, but they had just stopped by before I called. Jack had lied to them, telling the cops she had accidentally taken the wrong medication for her MS, causing her to be delusional. Because my mom has a criminal record of substance abuse, so they believed him. The cops told my mom if she called again, they would arrest her.

I need to help her. I'm scared of what he's been doing. She has no way to get away, as she no long has a car (Jack 'borrowed' it to someone over three months ago) and she terrified of using her phone to get herself any help, as Jack will know. I need to get her out safely, along with those important documents, as she has no other way of identifying herself otherwise.

76,Buying a house with friends?,1589124656,"I’m 25. Two friends and I are looking to get a house together for a few years. Now, out of the three of us, I’m in the most financially advantageous position (for reasons too complicated to get into, I went from being a broke college student to a trust fund baby in the span of a year). Don’t misunderstand me, I don’t have unlimited money (and if I want to have a shot at a retirement as a millennial I have to invest it wisely; this isn’t money I can just live off of indefinitely) but I do have some capital to work with. My friends are still pretty much paycheck to paycheck though. I was already looking at houses for just myself seeing it as a more wise investment than throwing my money at ANOTHER absentee landlord, but it would be easier to have others to split the rent, and I’ve got issues with depression anyway, so it would be beneficial to me to live with other people who I know care about me.

I digress.

While the three of us are all in on living together and sharing expenses, it’s looking pretty legally sticky. Neither of them feel comfortable signing a mortgage or any kind of loan with me for fear they’d hurt my credit, and they don’t care for a Tenants in Common (TIC) agreement that could give them equity in the house. 

Honestly, I’d be fine picking up the payments in a few years when they’re ready to bail and settle down. I looked into a Room Share agreement, but that would mean I’d be taking in their share of the mortgage as taxable income, which I don’t want to have to do. 

They’re perfectly happy signing an agreement saying they’ll split costs with me for a given amount of time, but I don’t know a way to do it that wouldn’t be a liability to me tax wise.

Any advice?

81,Landlord isn’t returning my security deposit,1589123665,"TLDR: Landlord isn’t returning my security 
deposit after constant emails and text messages 

I live in Denver, Colorado. The landlords are a couple. I have their email and phone numbers and I have been in constant communication with them. 

With all this pandemic happening, I had moved back home and I wasn’t living in my apartment anymore. So I asked my landlord if I could move out early, and she said yes, that there will be no issues as long as I can have someone move in and take over the lease. She also said she’s willing to not charge me utilities for the month of April. A week later she text me and says that she found someone and that I should move out as soon as possible. So I drove up to the apartment and moved out a week later on April 18. She never met up with me for an official move out so I texted her updates as soon as I moved out, took pictures of the empty, and clean apartment,  locked the door, and threw the key under the apartment so I didn’t leave it unlocked. 

Two days later, someone in the apartment next door texted me and said a new tenant moved in. 

Landlord said she was going to send me an itemized email with everything she should owe me (security deposit, pro rated rent, etc) and I sent her my forwarding address, but I didn’t hear back for a week. So I sent her an email breaking down everything I had paid (utilities, rent, etc) and the money she owes me. I texted and emailed her every other day since, and she either says she’s busy and she’ll get to it, or flat out ignore me. The new tenant already moved in so she should have already fixed anything that would’ve been an issue. 

I’m thinking on threatening to sue her in small claims court, but a few things are stopping me. How long do I need to wait after I move out before Its legally ok for me to sue her? Also, I’m scared to do It at all because I moved out early, I don’t know if that will hurt me in any way. She did state that it won’t be a problem as long as someone rented out my apartment, which they did.

87,Uncle was Shot by His Ex Girlfriend and the Whole Debacle. (MT),1589122466,"Hi everyone, just letting you know that I’m trying to keep this pretty non-specific because the ex girlfriend is crazy and has lashed out at me before and I’m also on mobile so sorry!

So here we go, last week my uncle was shot.  He was with his baby mama in a parking lot.  The details are kept away from even us but the most detail we have gotten is from news journals and because of the COVID-19 hassle we haven’t gotten any communication besides emails and phone calls.  

The order of events are very confusing, so after the ambulance takes my uncle away to the hospital the girlfriend gets taken into the police station for questioning, residue tests, and gets her phone and car confiscated.  The next course of action that the police take is dropping her off (I don’t know why they released her because she’s currently their only suspect) at my grandmother’s house aka my uncle’s resident with his mom, now call me crazy but I think that shouldn’t be allowed?  My mother doesn’t find out about her brother’s shooting until 2 AM when the crime happened at about 8 PM the previous day. 

So now our biggest issue has been between the police releasing the girlfriend, the issues with the hospital because of it, and dealing with custody of their young child.  Ever since the girlfriend was released from detainment, my mom has believed she shot her brother, even the detective explained that he thinks she’s guilty but they’re not keeping her in custody?  

The hospital has been one of our biggest issues, they’ve been rude, refused to tell us their policies, hung up on us when we try to get information, and have actually threatened to press charges on my mom.  The first day my uncle was in the hospital we set up a list of people who are allowed to have contact about my uncle’s conditions.  Then the next day we call and try to get updates and they inform us that he is not a patient at the hospital and the case worker for my uncle says that our list for people who can contact about my uncle practically has no hold and he can’t do anything else for us.  We have suspicions that the ex girlfriend is harassing the hospital and impersonating family members to try and get more information because as far as she knows he’s in a coma and possibly paralyzed.  The reason we have these suspicions is because she was spamming my grandmother’s phone for more information so much that my grandmother blocked her, then the next day we get blocked from getting more information by the hospital?  The hospital has then pressed charges on my mom who has only talked with the hospital 3 times from the time when my uncle was shot last week.  Upon further inquiring the hospital staff says that my mom keeps “calling them from different phone numbers and shrieking at them.”  My uncle has an ex-wife, who i refer to as my aunt, as well who is the mom of one of his children, the other is the crazy one, but when she called and asked for more information on behalf of my grandmother (who has memory and hearing problems as well as english not being her first language) she was treated very rude by the charge nurse who when asked for her name then hung up on my aunt.  For some reason the hospital claims that my uncle won’t allow us to get access to his medical conditions because they told him that opening up access would allow anybody who asked to get access to his information, when they know his life is in danger and that isn’t true at all.

We have been told repeatedly that hospital policies don’t allow us to have any updates about my uncle but they refuse to show us these policies or tell us where they can be found.  The hospital has threatened legal action against my mother when she has her phone records showing that she wasn’t harassing them.  The police haven’t been any help so far and keep moving the “interview” of the girlfriend farther and farther away as well as not putting any order of protections on my grandmother or my uncle when their top suspect is still at-large and has access with their child.  

Their child is still with the girlfriend’s mom so the girlfriend still has access to her and nothing is stopping her from taking off with her child; she has her car back from the police and even had it immediately detailed which she told my aunt for some reason.  We have several eyewitnesses saying that the girlfriend keeps loaded guns around her house while her young child is allowed to walk around without supervision as well as a testimony that she threatened my uncle while she was drunk, her kid was there, and she had a gun in her hand.  There was even news last night that the ex-girlfriend tried to take off, and it’s not surprising either there’s really nothing stopping her.  She’s gotten a lawyer and it seems like things are running by her own accord.

At this point our family can’t trust anybody whether it be the ex girlfriend, the detective, or the hospital staff and it’s super discouraging to our family that the girlfriend has so much control.  This might be a hard case because of my uncle’s past criminal charges/drug use or even because he’s a person of color whereas his girlfriend is white.  We don’t really know what to do from here but our current plans are to file for a restraining order for my grandma and hope for the best because we can’t contact the hospital at this point without legal repercussions.

2,Wedding Contract in Michigan,1589120092,"Hey all,

Like many out there, my fiancé and I are trying to figure out how to handle our planned wedding in Michigan in late June and I’m hoping some here may be able to provide us with some direction.  We are setting up some time to speak to our venue later this week and will obviously discuss options directly with them.

Essentially, my questions is whether we have a leg to stand on if we were to request a cancellation and full refund.

Some details - we’ve already made a 50% deposit (around 10k) and the contract states that there are no refunds.  From what I can tell, that’s all it says - nothing about “acts of God”, public heath, etc.

It sounds like currently, due to MI laws, we would not be able to have the wedding today, but it isn’t clear what the laws will look like in late June.  Based on the conversations we’ve had with the them, they appear to be willing to proceed with the June date, if state laws allow it (although, they’ve been non-committal so far).  They are also are caterer and have mentioned possible issue with their food vendors.

The obvious concern is that their ability to host the wedding may require a couple of weeks notice, but our ability to plan and send out invites to guests requires a longer time horizon (i.e. we need to start making decisions ASAP).  Even if we were to reschedule with the same venue, we fear we could be repeating this whole process in a couple of months.

So here goes:
- does lack of specificity of the no refunds clause, help or hurt our case?
- would this be considered our cancellation?  Or would it be due to the virus?  Specifically, if they state they can make the decision 10-days prior, can they hold us to the contract, even if we need to make decision long before that?
- is there anything else that I’m not considering?

Any general feedback would be much appreciated.  So far, our relationship with the venue has been good and we’d love to work out something with them, even if we forfeited part of our deposit.  But I’d like to have a genera idea of where we stand so we can start making decisions.

Hope you’re all well.

If you haven’t read my previous post, then all you need to know is I sold an expensive item 3 months ago and the seller recently opened a PayPal claim that it was fake. Now, I’ve received the item and it is indeed different to what I originally sent. 

So in short, I’ve submitted a police report, went to a luxury boutique store to confirm inauthenticity and have been calling PayPal every couple days or so to reiterate my stance on this situation.

Seeing as how gravity is definitely a thing, all the furniture on my patio has been covered in dog urine and feces for about three to four months now. Obviously, I've had no use of my patio, nor my storage closet, since this began.

My property manager stated to me in person that they would serve my neighbor with a letter of Demand For Compliance Or Possession, but as the dog has continued to relieve itself on a daily basis since I was told that, I'm not convinced that letter was ever served. 

I have called local Animal Control, and was informed that this was a civil matter to be taken up with my property manager. 

For the last month, I haven't received a single response from my property manager, or anyone in my leasing office. I understand that ""response times are delayed due to reduced staff,"" but a month of no response or acknowledgment is officially unreasonable to me.

9,Mother was in a small car accident,1589119441,"Last year in California, my mother was a passenger using one of those ride service apps similar to lyft etc... The accident was caused by her driver who swerved into another lane and hit a car. 

The driver was undocumented and uninsured, and actually stole my mother's purse/phone after the accident.

My mother has back pain ever since the accident and and has been shown to have a herniated disc by the doctor. She has no other history of back related problems other than a surgery she had back when she was 14 years old. The old procedure involved placing a metal rod in her back to fix her posture. Now she has trouble walking and moving her legs. 

After all these years she has had no problems since. 

She eventually found a lawyer who was eager to take the case. Sent a demand letter for the maximum policy amount of the ride sharing company.

The lawyer seemed ready to get the process started in the beginning according to my mom but now his replies has become few and far between.

The lawyer told my mom that the insurance company is only willing to to settle for a small amount of money that would not even cover her full medical expenses or leave her with enough to survive as she cannot work due to this.

The lawyer said that the insurance company is claiming that the collision impact of the vehicle is not ""strong"" enough to justify her injury.

Now the lawyer is questioning my mom again about how ""bad"" her injuries are and is the pain severe... And ignoring the fact that the doctor said she needs mandatory corrective surgery to deal with the herniated disc.

The argument about the vehicles not showing signs of a *major* impact justifying her back injury sound really stupid to me.


She has documented back injuries following the surgery, confirmed by doctors. Is this argument really that strong? 

Is it too late in the process for her to look for a new lawyer?

10,Plans to adopt adopted cousin from rapist father,1589119415,"Throwaway. 

Hello, I don't know where to start with this. This will primarily be based on the Philippines. If there are other relevant subreddits for advices, kindly point me to them.

This is about my uncle and his adopted son. I'm related to my uncle as his wife is my mother's sister. However, his wife/my aunt passed away about a year ago. They have two adopted children (15M and 11F), they adopted their son when he was about 3-5 years old (can't remember the specifics, but I grew up with him) and they adopted the girl when she was around 7-8 years old.

My uncle has always been a pervert growing up, he has sexually harassed me and my cousins many times over the years. I finally left the Philippines when I was around 15 years old and was glad he couldn't harass me anymore. However, now, I'm 18F and found out that my uncle has been raping my 11F cousin since she was 10. He has fled our city to another province whilst medicolegal investigations are undergoing on my cousin (yes, despite lockdown). 

We don't know what's happening yet since the pandemic is being prioritised by hospitals, but I'm anxious on his custody over the kids. My mother and I are willing to adopt my 15M cousin as he's been treated poorly by my uncle and aunt growing up and this just became the final blow. However, both my mom and I are overseas and sadly can't take him here with us due to expenses and we're worried about him integrating from rural Philippines life to urban cities. My mom proposed that she can visit the Philippines for extended periods of time as she can work remotely. Further, we plan to let him live in our house with a helper covering his school fees and everything. However, I understand that this does not suffice the prerequisites for adoption as the child must physically have the parents present. 

Given this unusual circumstance, what actions can we take to adopt my cousin? Do we even have a chance in the first place?",legaladvice,False,1throwing1away1,/r/legaladvice/comments/gh21dv/plans_to_adopt_adopted_cousin_from_rapist_father/
11,Can I file a class action lawsuit?,1589119383,"So my fiancé got caught up in a scam and there seems to be a lot of people that have joined it. Basically they use a legitimate trading tactic as a disguise for their pyramid scheme. You join with an initial $235 investment for some pretty basic software that will “allow you to beat the market” when trading foreign currency. This is followed up with a $160 monthly fee for access to your “motivational mentor” and “education”. There seems to be a more “advanced” software for additional money as well. 

Now here’s the part where it gets extra shady. If you recruit others into the “business” then you will earn monthly income. What they call a Platinum 1000 will earn you $1000 a month and you can get to that level by recruiting 12 other people. If we do a little bit of math, 12 x $160 = $1920 meaning the scheme pockets $920 per month (plus the initial $2820 from the initial “investments”) and then will give you your $1000 a month. All of this of course is super illegal. There is no way to participate without at least paying the initial $235. 

So my question is can I go to someone to start a class action lawsuit? Luckily I convinced my fiancé how illegal the scheme was and we only lost $235, but I’m sure there are several thousands of people in our same boat or worse just from gauging the amount of people on the Zoom call with her at a meeting.

15,How best to Claim Unpaid Wages from an Unscrupulous Employer?,1589118497," I am in England.

So, this could be a long story, but I'll spare you the gory details.

Just before the ""lock-down"" in the UK, I started working at a local corner shop (an independent small store selling newspapers, food and alcohol - the big three ""essential goods""). The manager seemed okay, and insisted on paying me through official means, which was great. I was expecting a more ""cash-in-hand"" part-time situation. Over the next few weeks, he hired another worker - he told us he had been covering the full opening hours of the shop himself - and that his half-brother owned it.

Eventually he was missing for a few days and a third brother arrived at the shop (neither the owner nor my manager) and informed us the manager had been stealing months worth of profits, and had never informed the owner we were hired.

The third brother agreed to sort out our pay, and we should carry on as usual. The first pay-date came and went without money. The third brother quickly left. I finally met the owner, a real ""Del-Boy"" type. He took our payment details (now the 5th I've given these details), and insisted we would get paid. I told him I would not be returning to work until my missing (now two months) pay was covered.

Now he refuses to reply to my emails confirming the debt, or texts or calls.

There are a ton of other details - they are literally the shadiest trio I have ever met - but I'm not sure what actions I can pursue to get my money (now about £600).

TL;DR - working for some shady brothers during quarantine, missing two months worth of pay from April and May - not sure what to do next.

18,Is being forced to register for college a violation of 1st Amendment Rights,1589117983,"This happened a year ago, but I am just now wondering if my rights were violated.... In high school my school REQUIRED us to register for Community College. I asked if I could refrain from doing so, as I had zero intention of attending that  institution. They said no, I was not about to argue because I was not going to risk my good academic standing. A few months later, I am accepted into a University that I actually intended to attend and am registered for orientation there. We are then once again REQUIRED to do something related to this college: register for classes. I was 18, I said I did not want to register for classes and told them I was already accepted into a University with orientation planned and paid for. Once again, I was told no and required to go back with a community college representative and register for classes I absolutely did not want to attend. This was a public high school if it matters. Now I have bills from this institution that I never had the slightest bit of intention on attending... which isnt what I am worried about right now, but it is what got me thinking about this since I wouldnt have these bills in the first place if my HS didnt force me to register.

What worries me though is.. were my rights (as well as those of my dozens of other classmates) violated when my school against my wishes made me apply for college?

21,Should I sign this Return to work/Resignation/“permanent lay-off “ document?,1589117500,"Should I sign this Return to work/Resignation/“Permanent Lay-off” document?

Greetings All.  I'll try to keep it short but need your advices -  


 I was laid off at the start of April due to Covid-19.  
At that time I received and signed an initial [Document 1](https://imgur.com/jfCS3Et), indicating I was laid off and should *""please follow up with us at such time as you decide you would feel comfortable coming back to work and we will do our best to find a place for you...""*   


Fast forward about 4 weeks to this past Thursday, and I received via email [Document 2](https://imgur.com/H1x4NK5), asking me to sign that I will either return to work, or that I resign and the company is free to hire someone to fill my position.  During the month in which I've been not at work, I finally received unemployment benefit payments after about week 3.5, and around week 2  I received a single phone call from the boss asking about if I was ready to return to work where he also mentioned he would need to hire someone soon.  I said that I had been waiting for additional clarification from our state government regarding the Stay-At-Home order (MN) and was not yet prepared to return to work.  This was the last I heard from them up until the Document 2.  


My reading of [Document 2](https://imgur.com/H1x4NK5) is focused in particular on the second half where I am given the option to ""accept a permanent layoff below"".  The final line sentence where I am declaring agreement to the terms and sign simply indicates that I resign my position and  contains zero wording about being ""permanently laid off"" as he mentions above in the first paragraph.    


Also of note is that the original Document 1 that I signed no where said anything about a time frame for the layoff, which is shown in Document 2.  


I am worried that I could lose my unemployment benefits by giving the wrong response.  Should I sign this new document?  Does it need clarification?  Or am I being overly paranoid and just send it in.

Any thoughts on the situation are appreciated.  Thank you and good health to you, reader!

She has screamed at both kids for what I see as just being kids, the usual difficulties of parenting. 

I am petrified to leave her because I don’t think anyone including my friends or family will believe the life I live and how she treats us and therefore at best I will have 50% shared custody of the kids. 
I can almost guarantee she will abuse the kids more and more as they get older. 

My kids are my everything and the reason I take the abuse almost daily so I get to see them every day and can ensure their safety. 

She is a great mum 90% of the time but has some mental health issues like anxiety which cause episodes which results in the abuse. The kids are also her everything and I know if I tried to leave her she would fight tooth and nail to have as close 100% custody.

The lawyer that handles the trust works for a firm that specializes in debt collection and his name is not part of the law firm's name, so not a partner.

39,Questions about software law and licensing,1589110769,"This is a little bit long, but I hope someone can help me, and hopefully also help other software engineers/developers.

I don't know the correct flair, as I think this could be in multiple ones (international law, intellectual property, non-US)

---------------------------------

Background:

- I work as a full-time as software engineer at a multinational consulting firm.
- I signed a very big NDA and exclusivity contract on this company, but I plan to make a document, where they state that I can make this project and make money from it, being that I commit to working on it only outside work hours.
- I have an idea for a software toolset and I want to build it, license it, and sell it to companies/startups/developers/etc.
- I am from Portugal, but I want to sell licenses internationally.
- I want to protect my work and, in the future, be able to live off of it.
- My idea is a one time fee for each project that uses my software toolset and package.
- Software takes time, dedication and hard work, so I want to be able to license it and earn money from my craft, without someone stealing it and use it without paying.

---------------------------------

Questions:

(I am asking with examples to different types of software)

- How does software licensing work? I.e: what makes a software license valid? Do I need to go to some place/institution and get it signed by someone, or if I write a license and ship it with all my software is considered valid and I own the copyright?

- How do you enforce copyright in other countries? What about in China?

- (for example purposes): In the case of templates/themes. Imagine HTML/CSS/JavaScript Bootstrap templates (e.g: https://themeforest.net/tags/bootstrap) or even WordPress templates/themes (e.g.: https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress/corporate). How do they enforce the copyright and avoid misuse of the code? And how do they know if websites are not using them improperly (I.e: for free; stolen)?

- *(e.g.): Imagine backend code (the code that no one sees; the code behind a server or desktop application) or a framework. The example that comes to mind is the Qt company (https://www.qt.io/licensing/). They have a free license for open source and a paid license for commercial software. How do they enforce it? How do they know if a company is using it and profiting from their work without paying? What could they do about it?
(This is probably the one that would remove any doubts about the subject).*

- (e.g.): How do desktop applications enforce it's license to the copyright so other people/developers do don't violate it?

- Are there any resources I can read to know all of this?

*I agree that any and all information provided by me is legitimate, can be used in the case of neglected debt and that I am liable for a lawsuit of up to $100,000, including all legal costs throughout the legal process.""*

I guess ultimately, since I have proof I returned the item on my end, and they initially confirmed the return. Can they still debit me the cost of the item. They said they'll contact my credit card fraud department and all this sort of stuff.

I live in the UK but I was doing contract work for a US company, a startup.  They listed my name and a cartoon image of me on the ""Team"" page on their website.  Two months ago they terminated my contract but my name and the cartoon image are still on the Team page.  I emailed them a couple of days ago to ask them to take my name and likeness down.  The CEO responded with ""we will get to it"".

The CEO is basically a compulsive liar and has publically lied about worker numbers before.  As I understand it, in his view it's OK because it's a startup and he has to do everything in he can to make the company seem the best it is.  In my view, it's basically the CEO's psychopathology.  I'd would be very surprised if they actually took down my name and likeness any time soon because, in the CEO's eyes, that would make the company seem smaller and that would threaten their surivival.  This really bothers me.

I want them to take my name and likeness off their website.  In order to do this, I plan to send them a notice in a couple of weeks that I will charge them for the use of my name and likeness if they don't take them down.  Here is an example email notice to demonstrate what I'm considering:

-------------------------------

My contract with them had no clauses relating to the use of my name or likeness or anything like that.  As mentioned, it's a startup.  I was happy for them to use my name and likeness while I worked for them but I'm not happy now.

So my question is: if I were to file a complaint in a US court, would this kind of notice stand up?

Also, in the UK I can file a court complaint myself, I don't need a lawyer.  Is that the case in the US too?  How would I go about that?

Also, would it be possible to backdate the claim to when my contract was terminated?  Would I be able to make the last sentence read ""at a rate of $50 per day, backdated to the date of the termination of my contract""?

45,Did this cop do anything illegal?,1589109020,"Hi all, 

I'm a 16m and my brother is a 12m. Earlier today my brother and I went for a walk around our neighborhood, we went on this really small neighborhood trail that goes through maybe a 1/2 mile max. 

My brother and I get to the end of the trail and we hear someone walking up on the trail towards us. A guy comes up on the trail finally around the corner and he's maybe late 20s, bald, really fit, with his hand on his gun that's on the outside of his waistband. He's wearing jeans, and like a workout/ spandex shirt.

He walks towards us with his hand on his gun and asks us who we are and what we are doing there. 

I tell him we went on a walk to get fresh air and to get out of the house for a little. 

He says were not allowed to be there. 

I told him were sorry, we didnt know this was private property/ we'd been walking this trail our whole lives. 

He said theres a new law that only people that live in the neighborhood gets to walk along the trail. 

I said our address is at (...) which is on the block. 

He looked frustrated and his tone shifted from more ""concerned/ assertive"" to angry. He then pulled his gun out from his holster and pointed in our direction towards the ground. He then said, ""you guys should be lucky that I'm a cop and that from a far I could see you guys are kids and that phone you were holding was a phone and not a gun."" (I'd been texting on my phone while walking on the trail earlier)

I really didnt know what to say, i just laughed and said yeah. I laughed because I was extremely uncomfortable and I really dont know what he meant at the moment. He then told us to follow him back to the road and he was going to call the police.

He put his gun away, and we followed him, but I kept telling him, you can call our mom, and I told him we can literally walk up the street, our house is about 5 houses away from the trail head and that he can talk to our mom. 

We got to the trailhead. And there was a group of people (3ish people?) standing in front of the house across the street of the trailhead. It's like they were waiting for us to return? He then asked me if I had an ID. I gave him drivers license and my school ID (I know I should've given him my ID sooner but I literally just got my ID 2 months ago and wasnt thinking clearly cause I was honestly pretty freaked out). He then said he needed to run my drivers license number in his phone. A minute goes by and he says ""okay you're free to go"" and he walks towards the group of people. 

I ask my brother if he wants to go back but then he started crying and I'd realized he must have peed his pants while walking back. So we went home. 

Now my brother and I have been arguing all day about whether we should tell our mom. My brother is embarrassed about peeing his pants. And he still thinks if we tell our mom about today that shell call the cops to report the incident and then well get in trouble for ""trespassing"" from the cops because they'll follow up and maybe it is true that now that area is private property. I keep telling him we WERENT trespassing and if we were we would have gotten in trouble then and there and if it so happens to be private property now we TRULY didnt know. On the otherhand we both agree and are nervous about telling our mom and then her calling the cops to try and report him and then police getting mad at us for wasting police time or blaming us for making it up. 

He didnt hurt us. He just pulled his gun out and pointed it towards us on the ground. But there was no one around to see/ no proof. 

The only witnesses we have is the people in the house across the street from the trailhead (who we now assume called the police/ maybe he lives there and is a cop??) But all what they saw was him taking my ID. 

Also my brother and I agree that were not sure if he even did anything wrong. Apart of me is extremely ANGRY for how he handled his firearm considering were literally young teenagers going on a walk on a neighborhood trail and he treated us like we were doing drugs or stealing or causing damages or hurting someone. It was bizarre. 

Did the cop even do anything wrong? Is my brother and I being over dramatic? Should we tell our mom and try to report him/ is there anything to even report? Should my brother and I just let it go and move on? Also, was he even a cop? I told my girlfriend about the situation and she said she thinks he probably wasnt even a cop??? Also my gf says that she thinks what he said to us was sort of a weird threat about possibly shooting us and should be reported?? Thanks. 

Also before anyone accuses me of being anti cop our dad was in the Marines for 15 years before he passed away a couple years ago. So I have 100% respect for cops and military. But I feel extremely uncomfortable by this situation and I dont know what to do.

I confronted her she went crazy on me tried making herself look like the victim,we then stopped having contact with each other. 

YEARS later 2018 -2019 we started talking again. One day we were talking I brought up the fight we had about her hacking my accounts I asked if it was really her that hacked my Facebook and email, I explained how I didn't care and that I just wanted the truth and to put it past us. She then admitted in front of me and my boyfriend that she did take my facebook account and email years ago. I forgave her for it &amp; put it passed us, because she was my childhood friend I wanted that connection again.

We had a falling out in May of 2019. I called her out for being disrespectful towards me and my family, i had to end our friendship with how crazy she got. She did not take it well, she started attacking me on Instagram every day literally bullying me.i had to block her on multiple catfish accounts she made to get a hold of me (she will make multiple accounts under other people's names and photos just to stalk, not just me but anyone! That she doesn't approve of). then One day I woke up to emails from Instagram saying someone has logged into my account and that it has been deleted (she knew my password from it being my password for my wii she would use, I Know I shouldn't have trusted her again and I shouldn't have had my password the same for everything.) I confronted her about the Instagram hacking she of course lied and manipulated the situation with more insulting. I then said I was going to take it to the cops for harassment, she got scared and went quite. That night When I logged into my emails to change all my passwords I saw a new email connected to my current emails, IT WAS THE EMAIL SHE HAD HACKED AND KEPT FROM ME 12 YEARS AGO, what was so stupid of her is that she connected my hacked email to my current emails with my current password, There was no way that email could have had my current password that password was created 6 years after that email was hacked and stolen. I immediately changed all my passwords and logged out any other devices so she couldn't get into any other accounts or emails of mine again. every now and then I get an email saying someone is trying to get into my old hacked email she stole.

Couple days of silence go by then suddenly I get this message for a man saying someone has put my information out there and that I should check it out. She Doxed me!, She took a screenshot of my Facebook page and posted it on 4chan.org with my full name and phone number with this made up story saying ""she was my boyfriend and that I cheated on him with his best friend and ended up getting knocked up and now I am spreading lies to his family in an attempt to ruin his life"" she ended it with a "" Do gods work and by all means don't hold back"". The story of course is not true. people started pointing out in the comments that they could tell the story was fake how the story didn't add up to my profiles.one guy commented that he was trying to get her IP address. once he said that she got scared and took the whole thing down. I did get screenshots of the webpage.

But that's not the end. I forgot to change my snapchat password I found this out on March 29th of 2020 she has hacked my snapchat. When she got access to my snapchat my bitmoji connected to HER HOUSE LOCATION! I got screenshots of my snapchat bitmoji on her house!. snapchat also emailed me warning me that someone had logged in and sent me the IP address of login, the IP showed up in the same location of her house. I now have more proof that this woman is crazy and hasn't left me alone since may of 2019. She is also starting to go after my boyfriends accounts, we get emails that someone is trying to log in.

61,Seeking Advice for a Custody Agreement contract draft,1589103006,"My soon-to-be ex husband is willing to forfeit his custody rights to our two girls (2 &amp; 4), in exchange for being absolved of child support responsibilities. In the state of California where we live, this is not legally possible as ""a voluntary relinquishment can only be finalized if another person is assuming the role of the parent who is relinquishing their rights."" There is no one to fit this role other than myself and I cannot fill both roles in the eyes of the state. Additionally, ""Parental rights can only be terminated in California by court order. Parental Rights cannot be terminated by a parent who simply wants to avoid paying child support and is not being adopted by another parent.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am in complete agreement with my ex about his suggestion. I have observed him to be an unfit parent; details can be provided, but they generally boil down to abandonment-related negligence, and willful ignorance involving our youngest's autism treatments/evaluations. His dismissal of mental health sciences has directly impacted his ability to care for our girls in a manner that is healthy for their growth, especially with the complications at play.

&amp;#x200B;

The only sources about the laws I could find did not involve the consideration of the custodial party agreeing to forfeit child support, or if that could be a factor. I know it is not normally within the rights of either party to draft a contract involving these kind of terms, at least with the limited research provided. I am willing to forfeit the right to child support based in majority on the desire to be done with his presence in our lives as quickly as possible, with as little resistance as possible. The only thing I would be concerned about losing is his insurance for the girls' dental, medical, and eye insurances. It may be possible that my ex would compromise to only paying for these things, instead of full child support.

70,Sue my landlord for negligence?,1589100699,"I'm considering suing my landlord for not fixing things in my apartment that are a danger to my life. First it started with neglecting to have the gutters cleaned regularly and it caused a leak in my roof. The leak has happened every year since i moved in years ago and all he does is a shitty patch job every time. The current leak has been leaking inside my apartment for almost two months now, I notified him to fix it 50 days ago and it's still not fixed. Here's the bigger issue, an electrical fire happened in my room where the leak is about 30 days ago. Tons of smoke billowed into the room from within the walls, turned the electric off and that stopped the smoke but how the fire started is still unknown. We started having rats in the ceiling/walls a couple months ago too so I  reckon it either started from rats chewing on wires or the leak dripping onto the electricity..... 

Luckily everyone was safe no property damage but it did cause a lot of emotional distress and I've been increasingly concerned for my well being not knowing if the bad electric could ignite again so I have the breakers completely turned off. This week I start getting suspicious of my landlord neglecting things for so long and I looked up the property for any violations. He's had a class C (immediate hazard) violation for almost a YEAR. He's got an illegal front door that can padlock and trap us on the inside, big fire hazard. And my floor has no fire escape either that's not even reported!

75,"[Texas] For a small claims case, can I provide affirmative defenses in my request for a Motion to Dismiss?",1589098993,"I’m acting Pro Se as the Defendant. The Plaintiff does not currently have an attorney, and I do not plan on getting one myself unless the situation escalates. 

Pursuant to Texas Civil Rule 91a, I‘m considering filing a request for a Motion to Dismiss a small claims Citation. As a bit of background, the case is Plaintiff vs. Me and a Trust. I have no association with the Plaintiff or Trust, legal or otherwise. The Plaintiff claims that I and the Trust are a single party. To the best of my knowledge, the Trust does own the rental property the Plaintiff filed the complaint about. No idea about any of the trustees. I literally have absolutely no connection with any of the named parties in the Complaint. They’re all complete strangers to me. 

The Cause of Action given by the Plaintiff on the Citation/Petition essentially comes down to, “My previous landlord owes me my deposit and additional fees over the course of my rental history. The landlord refuses to give me my money back.” Neither the contract/lease nor the address for the supposed rental property is provided. I got the address during a phone call to the Plaintiff (recorded, of course), but I’m taking it with a grain of salt. The Cause of Action also fails to mention me by name or assign me to the role of landlord or owner. 

Basically, I’d appreciate some insight on whether or not I can provide affirmative defenses to support my Motion and if the court will actually consider them. I know that Rule 91a hasn’t been super popular since it supposedly only allows the court to make a decision from the Cause of Action, but I think the Texas Supreme Court set a precedent earlier this year with its ruling on Bethel v. Quilling, Selander, Lownds, Winslett &amp; Moser. Basically, the Court allowed for affirmative defense to be taken into consideration when used with Rule 91a; this is something I would mention specifically in my request as legal precedent. I’m just worried since 91a basically says that I’d have to pay the Plaintiff her court fees if the Motion is denied. In light of this, I’d also appreciate some advice on whether I should file an Answer instead of a Motion to Dismiss.",legaladvice,False,an0nstudent,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggxnw0/texas_for_a_small_claims_case_can_i_provide/

I tried again, but she blocked it, however her own hand was pushed into her face. I had drank a couple beers while she was gone, shocked at her insistence to go and leave me and the kids, and so when I went to leave, she called the police to stop me driving drunk. They saw a ""mark"", and I was arrested sitting in my carport (I never went anywhere). 

She tried to get me out, calling the jail crying, but of course that's a no go.

83,"Legally, does a seller/builder have to disclose the foundation of another structure located in the yard of the property being sold?",1589095360,"Just closed on a new construction a couple of weeks ago. Have had some problems with the builder—for instance, I am the first person in the new development to close, and the builder/seller didn’t take the lockbox off my door when I asked them to and they kept saying they would do it later, which resulted in the house getting broken into about two days after I closed and a bunch of my stuff getting stolen (they ended up breaking the lockbox open and just using the key to get in). Also, some of the builder’s guys have been on my roof having lunch and stuff without notifying me because they didn’t know anyone lived here yet and one morning I opened my blinds to one of the guys facing my window and we both scared each other. Some other annoying stuff too, like the builder not yet installing a cluster mailbox so my mail is in limbo and charging extra for everything down to the toilet paper and towel racks, but I’ll get to the main point where my legal question comes in. 

Went to start tilling my backyard today (new construction didn’t come with any grass or landscaping, just the “soil” which is pretty much bark slivers) and hit something hard. Thought it might be a rock or some construction debris so kept going and kept hitting it. Dug out part of what looks like a foundation for an old house, barn, or driveway that takes up half my yard, probably 50’ x 20’ in total and at least 2’ deep (still digging so not sure how thick it is in total yet). The seller/builder had to have known about this, right? They didn’t do grass anywhere but did “plant” a bunch of cheap trees in the half of the yard where the concrete is but not in the other half, so I think they were trying to hide it. Is it illegal to have not disclosed this? The houses in this new development are more expensive than others in the surrounding area because of the large yard space, which is rare for the city I live in and thus why I decided to go with this house, and now come to find out that half my yard is concrete. Not sure if other yards in the development will have any similar issues, but since we’re all paying the same price, seems like I should be getting the same amount of yard space and not have mine halved by concrete. 

Any recommendations on how to handle this? Should I contact the builder directly and see if they can/will do anything? I paid extra for a one-year home warranty but not sure how that works when it comes to the yard. Should I just get a jackhammer and try to do it myself? Should I reach out to a lawyer? Finances are tight right now after closing costs, down payment, and work being slow from the pandemic, so this extra hassle so soon after closing is a real bummer. I spent most of my leftover money on having a fence built since I got freaked out by the burglary, but now come to find out that half the fence is built over concrete and will likely have to be removed and rebuilt if the concrete is to be fully removed. Do I have a right to compensation for remedying these defects, especially since I just closed, the house has a one-year warranty, and the builder is clearly coming and going at my house anyway since he keeps getting up on my roof and the like?

85,Any lawyer here knows of immigrant rights regarding loss of employment without good cause?,1589095095,"Recently it seems that I've been accused of something (still don't know what) and a detective wanna talk with me. I've been put on leave

Long story short: I'm hiring a lawyer, trusting he will bring on the truth about it and my persona is stopped from being related in any way with whatever matters at hand.

My question is regarding what's next:

After my name is clear from the picture and the law sees that I am indeed a victim of defamation if any. What will happen?

I fear my employer/district won't want to hire me again even though I am the victim here.. making me a double time victim . Some lawyers have told me this. I know at least one teacher that's been on leave and has returned.. that gives me certain calm.

What are my immigrant rights regarding this? Basically I left everything in my country to become a teacher here in the states and now I can be robbed of it because someone decided to accuse me of something that most likely they did? (Assuming there's indeed a child that's being abused somewhere IF it's that). What are my rights as an immigrant worker?

Is the law telling me that is ok for my employer to fire me if someone accuses me of something that I did not do at all? Is that enough reason to basically Rob someone of years of hard work and dreams? Is this the great America? Come on.. there must be someone that's not completely insane here?

 Some kind of lawyer that says to my employer: ""turns out your employee is innocent and was put under severe stress and loss of time and money because he was falsely accused of something he didn't do at all...  there was absolutely no evidence whatsoever of these claims/allegations, he's in the clear.. do not date to fire him on the basis that you rather don't have someone being wrongly accused of something.. he's already been put under severe stress and robbed or time and money""

Does a lawyer defending someone like me exist? Can my employer fire me ""only because""? I mean.. I know the joke's on me but really.. what are my immigrants rights regarding this?

I trust what these lawyers are telling me isn't truth: that even when I am innocent and everything points out to that and the investigation ends up knowing this.. my employer will most likely fire me. That would make in my eyes, my employer even more harmful than whoever's accusing me of God knows what

91,"""Site"" Unseen. Signing a new lease during COVID without seeing the new place in person. What should/ can we have included in the lease to protect ourselves?",1589093863,"tldr; we like and trust our current landlord/ building management company, and they've really been working with us to answer our questions about the new place. We have also been pretty good tenants: payments always on time, incredibly well behaved dog, etc. We are moving to another property they manage. However, because of the COVID crisis we haven't been able to see our new site in person - though the current tenant did provide a pre-recorded video walk through and pictures. 

**Pandemic related legal advice:** I'm wondering what kind of protections we can/ should reasonably negotiate into our lease with that in mind?

**Part legal, part regular advice** (so maybe I'll post this somewhere else, but might as well throw it in here): is it weird to ask them to give my contact information to the current tenant in case they'd be willing to talk to me? Just about anything they think is worth telling the next people who live there. I'm also especially curious about what Internet provider they are currently using. Does it make it easier to set up Internet in a new place if you just use the previous provider?

**Non-pandemic related legal advice:** one of us kind of has their own business buying and selling trading cards. They have been ramping it up and getting it off the ground for a while. In the new place they want to use one of the rooms (or part of a room) as sort of an official home office and might try to get some kind of tax deduction for it. They know they need to have the space clearly demarcated and all the stuff the government needs to see for a place to be tax deductible (or whatever the terminology is for that). Is that something we should disclose to the landlord and might that affect anything? (To be honest they've been really responsible about researching that stuff, but they're asleep right now so I can't ask them what they already know about it.)

More details:

We are happily moving from one apartment (in an apartment building) to another (a whole floor of a rental house). One of us is getting a second degree at the nearby university this fall so it made sense to move closer to it (even if they may or may not be doing in person classes right away). We've needed more space for a while anyway.

We have been really happy with the management company that is our current landlord, because they've been incredibly responsive to issues pertaining to mice, natural wear and tear in the appliances, etc. They've also been good about COVID: apparently we have some nurses in our building or something, so the management company increased the regular cleaning of communal areas. We decided to stick with them when finding a new space, because the neighborhood by the local university has some notoriously awful slumlord-landlords. 

The new place is owned by someone else, and this will be the first time our management company- landlord takes over the property management for them. The current tenants should be fully moved out by the end of the month (May), if not earlier because they are students who are wrapping up their school year. The management company will then have a month to make any fixes because our current lease ends at the end of June, so we'd move then. The place comes ""fully furnished"", but the property managers are pretty sure most of it can be taken out since we're bringing our own furniture.

We've all been renters for a while, so the basic questions regarding utilities, parking, security, etc have been asked and handled. 

Less stressful and the total opposite of what a lot of people are going through right now. Moving into a new place, not worried about getting kicked out of one.

94,Ex Boss Stole Personnel Files,1589093463,"
TLDR: My wife’s crazy ex-boss’s business got in trouble with the law, ex-boss tried unsuccessfully to blame my wife, wife quit and ex-boss got fired ...now we got a letter saying ex-boss went into the business after hours and took confidential employee personnel files (including wife’s). Business reported it to police. How worried should we be? Is there anything we can do? 

.      .      .      .

My wife took a job at a counseling center as administrative staff. On paper the job seemed sound and she has experience and was highly recommended by a family member who was executive level staff.

1) They gave her a different position/title than agreed upon. Different hours and no benefits. Although this was so many red flags, there was the fact wife was transitioning to almost no commute from 2.5 hours a day. So she kept the job while lookin for something else as close.

2) The “training” was practically non-existent. (They basically said, we don’t know how to do this either, figure it out.) Wife did figure out and streamline some of those processes eventually, except...

3) The CEO was personally involved in the day to day and instructed the team on how to do some of the work, but what they were instructed on turned out to be illegal/fraudulent. Also executive level family member retires.

4) Eventually the boss got caught and tried to blame the team but mainly my wife. (Although my wife had previously openly challenged the ethics and legality of their process)

5) This led to a meeting where the CEO retaliated by trying to cut my wife’s hours and title and force her to sign a document stating CEO had instructed her NOT to use that process. Which was a complete lie, so my wife refused to sign it. Then shady CEO requested her to write “Refused to sign” and initial... wife wrote “Refuse to sign, this is a lie” and initialed and requested to keep a copy. Shady CEO went to photocopy, but while gone, wrote on it “did not read” and signed it before copying and giving a copy to my wife. Wife immediately resigned from that toxic work environment.

6) It has been a few months now, wife has a new good job. The counseling center has ejected the CEO and relocated with all new staff, completely distancing themselves. We think that nightmare is over.

7) Both the counseling center and the Shady CEO have retained counsel. The counseling center lawyer has been trying to contact my wife, but she just wants to put it all behind her since she resigned and moved on. Now retired executive level family member requests wife to talk to lawyer, but won’t or can’t tell her why they want to talk to her.

8) We get a letter today (Re: Breach of Confidentiality) ...that just after the counseling center rid themselves of shady CEO (coupled months ago) the shady CEO’s spouse entered the counseling center building after hours and stole confidential employee files. Letter says they were returned within a week, but the counseling center has reported it to the local police.
(Shady CEO and spouse own the building)

So after all that...how worried should we be about my wife’s personal information/confidential employee file being stolen by shady CEO? Is there anything we can do about it?

97,Ex parte in Florida,1589093215,"A little over a year ago, two police officers knocked on the door of my mother’s home at 3:30am. She answered the front door while I was in a bedroom by myself. I was taken from the bedroom to the police car by the officers. The officer handcuffed me and then closed the door and drove to the hospital. When we arrived at the hospital, he took the handcuffs away from me and walked with me towards the hospital er behavioral health entrance. The officer gave judge order papers and copies of my id (idk how he got those but he waved them at me when the police told me to go with them from home) to the er nurse and then they guided me to a section of the er where I was locked inside. I was put into a room by myself after they gave me a hospital gown to wear and took samples of my blood. They took my belongings (clothes, phone, wallet). If I hadn’t gone with them or did what they told me to, the nurse and officer were ready to do it all by force. I was extremely intimidated yet threatened by what seemed to be professionals. I gave them the requested samples and went into my room by myself. They just left me there for a while then a couple of nurses entered the room to talk about a few things then brought me a weird breakfast so I had that even though I experienced trauma from that entire unexpected situation. So I’m a 24 year old female and was 23 at the time that happened. There were older large adults that guided me to that abnormal er room (there was only a cot/bed and chair inside the room) at that point and i was locked in that part of the hospital. There were only a few of those types of rooms and a bathroom at the end of the hall. There was a nurse station and secured doors that separated the mini psych er hall section and the rest of the hospital on that floor. The nurse told me once I finished the procedures with them, then I was sent to a doctor for the involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Normally it’s a baker act that gets ppl into there but mine was an ex parte (iderk). Apparently the ex parte was filed from my mother... then a judge signed it off and then police officers went out to follow the order so they got me and took me to the hospital for the involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Ugh. Once I got in and saw the doctor, I refused to take meds. They can get orders for medicine to be requirement. If I didn’t take the drugs then they had the job to restrain a patient and inject them with the medicine. So I didn’t take them (ambien for sleep at first, then some antipsychotics and benzodiazepines). Then they held me for more than the max 72 hour hold of the evaluation. I had to meet a social worker and doctor almost daily for 3 weeks in that hospital. My access to a phone was limited to a landline by the nurse technicians that worked in the behavioral health facility -behind a glass window locked door office. This is frustrating btw. I had to slur conversations with doctors, nurses, social workers, and patients while held against my will or better choice to stay locked up and drugged in a strange hospital. So I did what they told me to do, made up an outpatient plan, took the medicine, practiced fake smiling, took care of myself, and even spoke to estranged family members of mine that called the hospital to try and reach me. Sometimes the nurse office took messages for me until they saw me in the halls. Then they shared that I received phone calls with a note of a recipient phone number. There were limited phone use times and sometimes the phones didn’t work. I tried calling 911 the day I got into the ward and then the front desk nurse restricted my phone use. Apparently it’s frantic to make a 911 phone call if you’re hospitalized/abducted from your bedroom in the middle of the night? Eventually, I had a trial in the hospital against my mother and the doctor i met with 3 times since the start of the evaluation. I went through the legal process with the doctor and public attorney (that was assigned to me and met 5 min before the trial in an office room outside of the main group lounge meeting area for the facility) SO the results were that my mother claimed guardianship of me since I refused medication the first week of the hospitalization... When I couldn’t sleep or eat or feel anything... probably out of shock. They took advantage of me in so many ways. I’m still getting my life together anyway. I didn’t need to go to the hospital and there’s a lot more about this that happened. For example, I was violated by the staff and some other patients. When I left the hospital after 21 days in there, I went home to my mother’s place to get my stuff then caught the flu so I watched our cat and handled my flu while my mother was out of town then she returned and I left town. I moved a bunch then went back to college and have faced so many obstacles since that hospitalization. I never went to the scheduled outpatient because I moved out of town also I was over the entire situation but I’m not really okay. Now I’m in school to finish my dual major degree and I can’t afford anything. Still getting over any traumatic experience. Still worrying about medical concerns, bills, school, housing, or anything I have control over.

1,I am an immigrant teacher with a working visa,1589091753,"Recently it seems that I've been accused of something (still don't know what) and a detective wanna talk with me.

Long story short: I'm hiring a lawyer, trusting he will bring on the truth about it and my persona is stopped from being related in any way with whatever matters at hand.

My question is regarding what's next:

After my name is clear from the picture and the law sees that I am indeed a victim of defamation if any. What will happen?

I fear my employer/district won't want to hire me again even though I am the victim here.. making me a double time victim . Some lawyers have told me this. I know at least one teacher that's been on leave and has returned.. that gives me certain calm.

What are my immigrant rights regarding this? Basically I left everything in my country to become a teacher here in the states and now I can be robbed of it because someone decided to accuse me of something that most likely they did? (Assuming there's indeed a child that's being abused somewhere). What are my rights as an immigrant worker?

Is the law telling me that is ok for my employer to fire me if someone accuses of something that I did not do at all? Is that enough reason to basically Rob someone of years of hard work and dreams? Is this the great America? Come on.. there must be someone that's not completely insane here?

 Some kind of lawyer that says to my employer: ""turns out your employee is innocent and was put under severe stress and loss of time and money because ""x"" wanted to avoid jail.. there was absolutely no evidence whatever of these claims/allegations, he's in the clear.. do not date to fire him on the basis that you rather don't have someone being wrongly accused of something.. he's already been put under severe stress and robbed or time and money""

Does a lawyer defending someone like me exist? Can my employer fire me ""only because""? I mean.. I know the joke's on me but really.. what are my immigrants rights regarding this?

I trust what these lawyers are telling me isn't truth: that even when I am innocent and everything points out to that and the investigation ends up knowing this.. my employer will most likely fire me. That would make in my eyes, my employer even more harmful than whoever's accusing me of God knows what. As you all may imagine this prospects puts me in the verge of suicide.. thus making me a full victim of both: my accuser and my employer..with my family suffering the pain..which is the only reason I won't leave this at times too messed up world.. that and because unlike whoever is accusing me, I actually love life.

3,Southern California Skydive Company pushing employees to return to work for reopening during Stage 2,1589091250,"TL;DR - Skydiving Company pushing instructors to come back to work, even though there is a high chance of getting sick due to close contact with passengers. Advice welcome. I think this is the right subreddit to post as well, if not, please direct. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a skydiving operation in Southern California as a Tandem Instructor. I strap people to the front of me and take them on skydives. After putting them in a harness, you board a plane and sit for 20 minutes until it’s time to jump. Once you reach altitude, you jump out, freefall for 60 seconds, open a parachute, and float down for the next 3-4 minutes. After landing, you’ll board a bus and go back to the hangar to do it all over again typically 8-10 times that day. During a normal flu season, it isn't uncommon to catch something due to the close proximity you spend with so many strangers. You're literally directly behind their airflow during freefall and under the parachute. Not to mention the time you spend inside the airplane, and bus. Both of which are normally packed ""nuts to butts"".

Many times I'll land after a jump and notice snot, drool, or spit on the visor of my helmet that came from the customer unknowingly. Typically, it isn't a big deal because these things tend to happen at 120mph and the consequence isn't that dreadful. 

Fast forward to today. We're in the middle of a pandemic because there is a virus that is highly contagious and is easily transmitted through close contact of people. 

Like most of the country, we shut down in the middle of March because the country went on lockdown. This was obviously the right decision because we are a non-essential business and the risk of spreading the virus among each other is very high. 

I just received an email, saying that the company has received funding through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and that I have 7 days to let them know if I plan to stay with the company once they open again. If I don't send an answer back, or if I say no, then I will no longer be considered an employee for the company and they'll release me from employment. 

I responded to the email asking;

When exactly would we reopen? (expecting phase 3 or 4). Employer responded, ""we are in constant contact with the Mayor of the city is very pro active as (city) has very few cases for the 190.000 population and has sent a letter to San Diego County already 20 days ago to re open all business (I have attached). We are opening Tandem Skydiving in phase 2 second part when Groups of 10 or more are allowed again. This to be expected over the next 2 weeks.""

What steps would be taken to ensure safety of all parties? Employer responded, ""Your decision is at free will - we are offering you to be put back on payroll if you confirm within 7 days. this is a requirement from the government to qualify for the PPP program as many business are facing exactly that question (Hairdresser are asking how should we qualify for the PPP program rules when we are not even allowed to open ?) We have decided to put all of you back on payroll even we dont know when we are able to open. We offer that to you - you have the choice. If you are not coming back we have to report that to the program as funding is based on former payrolls""

If I choose to not come back to work after this week, am I giving up my unemployment benefits? Employer responded, ""this is a decision that is from the government to be made. We are just taking you off payroll if you are not confirming within 7 days - again we are required to do that.""

Overall, I guess the advice that I'm looking for is whether or not I should say yes or no? Do I say no, and try to stay on Unemployment Insurance? Or say yes because I don't want to lose my job. I don't want to be on unemployment, but I also don't want to be hooked up to a ventilator because my job pressured me into coming back to work too soon because they were just trying to meet guidelines to fill their PPP loan. I'm very happy working for this employer, and I love my job, I just think they aren't thinking about the severity of the situation at hand. I honestly don't think strapping strangers from all over to me right now is a good idea and I don't want the anxiety of wondering if I am going to get sick BUT I also don't want to lose my job. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks for any input.",legaladvice,False,drawinggablank,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggw61e/southern_california_skydive_company_pushing/
4,Need advice. Car dealership has made bad situation worse,1589091096,"Need advice (26f). Car dealership is ruining my life.

Please help me or tell me if wrong and lead me right direction before you read further. I am not the type of person who ever wants to make things up about an experience to get anything for benefit. I’m not someone who even would leave a bad review or ask a manager unless experience inexcusable. Please keep in mind. Before you read. Whether in communication with bank, dmv and even dealer. I have contacted all multiple times asking who do I need to resolve this? What can I do to help clear this up? Offering to do anything that is needed of me. It is not solely me relying on this manager at dealership to do so. 

So I bought a car in March. In april I got an email saying check your VIN as may be different then paperwork. Sure enough it was. The dealer made seem like no big deal come to dealership and we’ll redo everything good as new. Same year make and model. Keep in mine he acted like he did me a favor by keeping payments same lol. Well no shit why would they change since it’s basically same car so no different value really.  

I knew I’d have problems as at first he was doing everything in his power during quarantine in AZ to physically get me to come back. The dealership I bought from is autonation in phoenix and they’re 2 hours away. I told him this would not work since he wanted me to go during times I worked. To me it was crazy to basically drive 2 hours there and back so 4 total. Take time off work. Fill gas there and back. Risk being pulled over with a vehicle that is not registered to me at all and hoping an officer would believe me. All for the dealerships mistake. When there was an Autonation dealer in where I live, this sales manager would not let it go. He was very demeaning the entire time.

Finally I got him to realize it was not my mistake to fix so he fedexed papers to location I live. I went there signed was told he’ll email you a copy. Perfect right?? No. It gets a lot worse.

The dealer told me not to worry about payment as he will make first payment or just get extended. Well I’m so glad for listening to my gut because I called my lienholder. Lienholder told me they have no knowledge of the dealers mistake and payment is due. I called them multiple times. After speaking with sales manager I was in touch with finance manager especially by text from dealer. I told him in text which worked great for me so I could have proof of all our conversations. That by the way the lienholder said you haven’t told them about this mistake in paperwork and are saying I owe them. He promised me he did and doesn’t know why besides maybe they didn’t update their side. So I kept calling lienholder making sure it was all being done. No still nothing from him.

I go online one day to check account with lienholder and see another account for a car! I wanted to throw up now this lienholder believes I owe them for two cars. I called them immediately and once again nothing from autonation. I texted him saying they had two accounts. Well technically 3 because even one says a savings with them?? The first one being for original paperwork of course with wrong VIN. That I was under the impression could be an easy switch?? I told them once again I do not own this vehicle this is not a car I have ever even seen in person. They kept passing off as just dealer. Finally someone at lienholder had sense to report to a couple different departments like loans and have them reach out. I thought maybe this is hopeful? Not I haven’t heard from this person who’s supposed to be investigating this at all. 

I called DMV and at first the lady had the usual screw off attitude. By the end of our call I could tell she actually felt bad for me. Telling her how worried I was that one a car is registered to me and idk who it even belongs to?? And 2 the car I’m driving and in my drive way is not! She can’t even legally put me on that car because dealer didn’t even send them the paperwork. 


I am so fed up with this situation it is still going on. For well over a month. I am 26 and have always been a responsible person and was actually proud of how I had great credit. Was never the type to have all these accounts. Now this man has screwed me bad. He’s made up for all the bad decisions I could’ve made and screwed up my credit for in one purchase of a car! I told him thank you for making me most likely the only person who’s credit has been fucked by a stranger who’s not an identity thief or a pissed ex wife. He keeps trying to reassure me this will be better. I’m sick. 

I called the dealership asking for a corporate number as this was ridiculous. They said they don’t have one?? Lol! I asked general manager and was told my name would be taken down he’d call me back. 

Again I am not a spiteful person going out of my way to do this is not easy for me. I do have a back bone but I don’t want to take my time when I get off work to relax to deal with something I didn’t cause. And not once have I felt anyone down there has felt remorse for this crap. I feel helpless. I even asked lienholder do you want me to pay for the wrong vin payment then just switch to actual correct loan when resolved so my credit won’t be hurt?? They told me I could but they won’t report until after 30 days delinquent. I don’t think either they or dealer have been any help at all. 


Please help? Does making 2 auto loans under my name make sense to anyone for same year make and model? Why not a simple switch of VINS? It hit my credit for that 2nd loan that’s not accurate because I don’t even have 2 cars. It also hit my credit that he ran it again with other banks too! I thought maybe it was a Wells Fargo type bs at first with bank maybe. Yet dealer owned up to doing it. And trust me I did ask dealer and he went right over and did not answer. Like should I get a lawyer? What can I do? Time is running out and I can’t even imagine what my credit already looks like from this mess. This has been something that has been bothering me bad. 

By the way I have called lien holder and asked to speak directly with departments who can fix this. Ask them what paperwork do they need from me? Each time I am told representative I am speaking with is basically the middle man and will not put me on the line for whatever reason.

10,"Pre-closing, found out seller lied on disclosure form, WA state",1589089102,"In Washington State, first time home buyer and appreciate any insight. Made an offer on a single-family home, built in early 1900's, offer accepted, seller provided a disclosure form that noted no disclosures relevant to the current issues (only disclosed a non-specific infestation had occured at some point). We hired an inspector who noted several hazardous issues with the home that he said must have been around for quite some time to be in the state they are in, items that the seller's specifically noted on their disclosure as didn't exist or that they ""didn't know"" if there were any iasues. Our agent learned, in speaking with the Seller's agent, that many of the issues were known by the seller as they were present at the time they bought the house and their original inspection. However, they specifically noted on their disclosure that there were no issues or that they didn't know, an obvious falsehood. Note also that there are Ring cameras all over the house (it's unoccupied) so I don't know if they could have been monitoring our conversations within the House- we tried to be discreet around the ones we noticed.

We have had a few contractors inspect the larger issues and provide estimates for repair so that we can negotiate. We learned from our agent that the seller also happened to have a contractor provide an inspection and estimate for the major issue (foundation issues), which happens to be many thousands of dollars less and does not cover the entirety of the job, than our estimate, and provided it to our agent.

We love in a seller's market, even during COVID-19, so I don't know that we will have much negotiating power, especially since they just happened to get their own bod for an issue they claim they knew nothing about. At this point, if we pull from the sale we will lose thousands in inspection and loan administration fees, is there any recourse to get this money back given they knew about the issues and lied? The only proof we have is the seller's agent speaking with out agent and mentioning it, and the fact that they just happened to get a quote for the needed repair, but I suppose, for the second piece they could claim they heard it via their surveillance cameras.",legaladvice,False,4goodnessbakes,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggvq7m/preclosing_found_out_seller_lied_on_disclosure/

About for years ago, I settled a lawsuit against a school district due to abuse I suffered as a child and I got a sizable amount of money out of it.  Right afterwards, my dad created a trust account with my money without my permission.  

Since then, he only gives me $150 a month and says that I don’t need more since I’m already paying for rent, and other bills.  The only time I’ve ever been given more is if we’re on a trip or if I’m buying birthday/Christmas gifts.  Unfortunately, I have at least $70 a month in bills that my dad won’t put on the card linked to the trust account and I have to keep a minimum of $50 in my account every month.  

He does this to my mom too.  He has control over both of our finances and gives us allowances every month.  And he watches our accounts so he can see every penny that gets spent.  He says this all will make me appreciate money more, but if anything I think it’s made me more irresponsible with it.  

I don’t know how to pay a bill, I don’t know what’s in my account, and I don’t even know how to write a check.  I want to be able to talk to him about this, but I don’t know how to do it without starting an argument.

17,Why did I get fined? Indecent exposure in park?,1589088588,"Hello,

My boyfriend (23M) and I (22 F) haven't seen each other in a while and can't meet indoors because we live with family. We love to hike, and because of Covid-19, that's all we've been able to do lately. We decided to go to a state park today, in PA. I thought It'd be fun to watch a movie in the car after the hike, so we packed snacks and hot chocolate. After the hike, we put the back seats down and cuddled up to watch a movie. I'm completely against the idea of car sex, my boyfriend knows this. I find the idea of it stressful and immature. He starts making out with me during the movie though, and ends up begging me to give him a blowjob. I told him we shouldn't, I don't think it's a good idea. Although we parked in a far, secluded area I was still paranoid someone could come. He insisted it'd be fine though, so I did it. I stayed fully clothed. He took his clothes off, but when it was over he put his underwear back on. I just layed on his chest after, and we just talked for a while.

 A park ranger stopped by though, and my boyfriend quickly put his pants back on. The ranger was like ""you obviously know why I've stopped you."" He asked us to get out of the car, took our information, and eventually fined us. He said that it could have been much worse (indecent exposure, etc.) I said nothing at all during all of this, I was shaking and terrified because I have never been in trouble in any way shape or form. I think I was just shocked, and scared. Thinking back to it now though, I was fully clothed when he stopped by, my boyfriend was in his underwear.

18,"[USA, Ohio] My.. I guess complicated possibly former significant other is trying to go around CPS.",1589088411,"State: Ohio  
County(s): Clermont and Brown  


Alright, so this begins last week I believe it was Tuesday May 5th, 2020. I had not heard much from my boyfriend for the past roughly 8 days one of the times he did say something to me he said he had a lot stacked on his plate with his job and ""personal obligations"" as he put them. Well little did I know that that Tuesday I got a call from him telling me what exactly that meant.   


He called me and told me he has chosen to adopt two children, a two-year-old girl and one that will not be born until September. He said more or less that once the virus dies down then he will  be getting his own place for them all to stay. The reason why he is doing this because his mother who he knows as a good friend and stresses that they are just friends has been deemed unfit to have custody of her kids (She is on 3 year probation for what he claims is ""weed and alcohol""). He told me he intends for this mother to live there with him and the children so she doesn't lose her kids. He claims he would be saving them from the foster care system since the father(s?) of the children are ""metheads"". He had told me that he called someone from CPS and they said that was allowed however, I find this hard to believe that CPS would allow them to defy court orders like this.   


Sidenote: He is a 20 year old male about to be 21 and had lived in Florida last year for about six months and has Florida license plates on his car. Looking at this section of Ohio law specifically at C:2 it states he would need to live in the state for 5 years straight to adopt ([http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2151.86](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2151.86))  


My Legal Questions:  
I am worried that he is doing something that could get him into some level of criminal trouble however, I really don't know if he'll even be able to adopt these kids. He doesn't have a place for himself yet.  


1. Can he actually adopt these kids and then live with the mother that was deemed unfit?  

2. Will he get into trouble for defying a court order and potentially get arrested?  

3. This was reported to out of concern to CPS in Clermont county because the only thing that is known about the mother is that she went to school in that county. But the adoptee lives in Brown county. Do CPS offices in different counties communicate to each other or should it be reported to Brown county too?

29,Slumlord in PDX,1589086175,"Hi all. Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I have lived in and older apartment building in Portland, OR for almost two years now. Privately owned by one man, and managed by himself and his son. Tenants pay one lump sum to the landlord for “utilities.” This covers water, sewer, garbage, and building maintenance. In the time that I have lived here, the water to the building has been shut off twice. The first time, notices were hung on every door by the water bureau. I was early enough to see mine and have kept it. When I came back, the landlord had removed all of the others. Most recently, a notice was posted on the front door of the building. I was able to take a photo before the landlord again trashed it. 
Now! Being that the building is older and the rent is somewhat cheap, I don’t expect it to be extremely nice. However, several things that need to be fixed have been completely ignored. (Unfortunately the old texts with the landlord have been deleted before I took a screen shot.) But, most recently, I reached out to notify the property owner that large amounts of bees have been coming in my open windows. There are no screens, and the windows are required to be open for at least an hour post-shower— in the lease— because there is no fan or ventilation in the unit. 
The bees are mostly a non-issue for me, but that’s only because I’m not allergic. 
On top of all that, there is a huge spider infestation in the building, trash in the halls and outside, and common use items like washers and dryers rarely work. They have also never responded over quarters being eaten, etc. I am not the only tenant to have brought these things up. 
I’m moving at the end of the month, but having a hard time letting them off the hook. They’re taking advantage of people that can’t afford to live elsewhere. Do I have a leg to stand on here?",legaladvice,False,inspectorgidget,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggv3zv/slumlord_in_pdx/
30,Made to work in a smoke filled building after a fire what are the laws regarding this?,1589086016,"If this isn’t the right flair, or anything sorry. I’ve never posted here. Not sure if this is even the right place to post this, but here goes. 

I live in Indiana and I need to know what the laws are about having employees work in a building where there was just a fire.

On Friday I was working my usual part time shift as an unloader at a particular package delivery hub facility. The kind that sorts packages to go to other areas in the state/region. 

An hour before we were about to be finished (a little before 8) with the sort for the day a fire erupted on the other side of the building. 

Somehow a hazmat (hazardous materials) package had caught fire in a trailer and it was either put out or it ran out of oxygen, then the guy that was in the trailer left to get the full time supervisor when it reignited and burned the entire trailer it was in completely. 

Everyone was evacuated when the alarm went off and we waited outside for over an hour while the fire department sorted it out. All this was fine and dandy until at about 9:30 they gave the okay for us to go in to get our belongings. 

Mind you that the building is still filled with smoke so much that my throat and eyes were burning, nose running and everyone else’s as well. I just wanted to get my phone to call my boyfriend to come get me. 

About 10 minutes after that they handed out cheap masks we’ve used for covid protection to use against the smoke and had us all gather at the opposite corner of the building that the fire happened so the man that run the facility could talk to everyone.

At that point I realized that building management was gearing up to try to make us work in this smoke filled building like nothing happened. I was livid. 

We were told if we didn’t feel safe being in the building to go outside and wait there, so I did. But to also be there to attend this impromptu gathering in a building filled with smoke from metal, plastic, cardboard, processed wood and who knows what was in that trailer that was charred so we could continue to work. 

Eventually the man that runs the building told us all that they needed us to work for another half hour to finish the shift and thanked us, when in reality my coworker was there until 1:30am, three hours after this point in time. 

After the guy that runs the place asked us all to continue working and head back to our work areas, I headed back to my own area where a supervisor, not mine, but the supe
for the area next to ours said “you know you can’t leave right?” To which I replied “sure”. 
That pissed me off to hear him say that as if I would lose my job for leaving somewhere that many people clearly do not feel safe, and many have already left without permission.

At 11:30 I told my direct supervisor I was leaving and I left. She expressed to me that if it were up to her she wouldn’t have been trying to make people work ‘in this environment’. 

I’m at a loss as to what I should do, but I’m almost certain it’s breaking some kind of labor laws to expect us to work in those conditions especially when some of us have asthma, respiratory conditions or such.

37,Help locating next court date,1589084995,"TL;DR - where the heck can I find/get notified of my court date?

I am in Chicago, IL staying at an Airbnb. Originally from NYC. I was staying at an Airbnb last February and was arrested for criminal trespass, misdemeanor. I had only been in Chicago for two weeks. 

I had taken Ambien and apparently was sleepwalking outside and went to an apartment that I thought was my Airbnb. It wasn’t. 

All I can recall from that moment is me standing outside his gate saying “You don’t understand. I’m staying at the Airbnb and I lost my key.”

He was standing in his doorway, no porch-light, with a handgun yelling at me. I called 911, the cops came, and I don’t know what happened next but I woke up in jail and was released with a court date for March 18th. 

I have no criminal record. Since I have no idea where this happened I didn’t leave my Airbnb for two weeks and then eventually moved to another Airbnb. I have no friends or family here. All I do is sit and wait. 

Due to Covid-19, my March 18th court date was postponed to May 1st (or at least that’s what I think it was based off of what little confusing information I got from the Cook County Clerk’s website). 

And now my court date is postponed again. I had called every number I could find to get an update. Nothing. They don’t have my correct address either so I haven’t received any notifications via mail. And nothing has been sent to my NYC address. 

I had a consultation with an attorney about two weeks ago and he was able to locate my next date, June 8th. Since all dates are being rescheduled and most appearances are now being done via Zoom I don’t even know where I am to go to do this. 

The Judge’s order on their website is difficult to read and parse and he mentions the branch courts are closed so everything is being done at the main Criminal Court House. 

My mother lives in Wisconsin and I had came to the area last year to take care of her. I am self-employed, currently have no income, and keep having to pay for an Airbnb (I can’t leave the state) just so I can be in Illinois. I’m on the verge of bankruptcy. If it getting postponed I will be broke, homeless. I don’t know how to apply for a job now with a court case hanging over me. 

My questions - is there a way (which doesn’t involve me having to endure virtual capital punishment) for me to contact someone to get my new court date and is it possible to petition the Court for an emergency hearing? 

I realize the answer may be “call the Clerk’s office”. I have. Close to 100 times as well as any other number I could locate that I thought would be helpful.

41,Car parked in front of my house. Boyfriend is disabled.,1589084363,"Hi,

We are located in Arizona.

We have a bit of an annoying issue. A car is currently parked in front of our house. We live in a college town and the houses in the complex are a bit far apart, but all of these houses have 3+ people living in them. Which means 3+ cars for each house. Many of the houses have garages, and ours does not. We have one parking spot in front of our house (very obviously just in front of ours, not near our neighbors etc) but our neighbors consistently park there. 

The next closest spot that does not belong to the neighbors is approx 250ft from our back door, which we do not have access to 24/7 (our roommates room has the back door in it). To go through the front door and walk around the cul-de-sac to get to the same space is approx 500ft. This is how we usually park because the space in front of our house is constantly taken up by other vehicles, frequently abandoned vehicles.

I completely understand that the street is public property and I have no right to this space. However, my boyfriend recently became disabled and cannot walk 500ft to get into the car. To get from our front door to the parking space is no more than 50ft. This is doable for him even when his illness is at its worst. 

Is there anything we can do to get a disability parking put into my complex for him? I really do not want to be afraid to leave my boyfriend home alone during an episode because he will collapse on his way to get into the car.

I currently live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Me and my mothers BF never got along. I sent him a formal letter kindly requesting he vacate the home on 31 May 2020. He isn’t the most sound person, so he immediately texted me after he got my letter and told me (this was 2 weeks ago) that it is “illegal” for me to kick him out right now due to the COVID-19. 

Me and him have no formal lease in effect. His name was NEVER on the house. The mortgage (which is ongoing that I am currently paying out of pocket for) has NEVER been paid by him. At this point he feels more like a trespasser than a resident.

I have drafted the below language. I would just like some brief feedback or recommendations on how to remove someone from a home.

Again, quick brief:

Home was in Mother’s name -&gt; Home quick deeded to me in 2018 -&gt; Mother passed away 2020 -&gt; Mothers BF not being cooperative leaving home -&gt; BFs name is not on mortgage or ANY home bills (e.g. electric, internet, cable, water, etc) -&gt; BF is NOT currently paying me nor is ANY formal agreement in place for his residency -&gt; best advice on how to remove him from home? 

Please be aware that I have reviewed STATE OF FLORIDA OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR EXECUTIVE ORDER NUMBER 20-94 (Emergency Management - COVID-19 - Mortgage Foreclosure and Eviction Relief). Under this Executive Order, it reads that the governor has suspended “any statute providing for an eviction cause of action under Florida law solely as it relates to non-payment of rent by residential tenants due to the COVID-19 emergency for 45 days from the date of this Executive Order, including any extensions” as of 02 April 2020. Under the State of Florida Statutes Title VI, Chapter 83, the definition under State Statute (SS) 83.43(4) of a “tenant” is “any person entitled to occupy a dwelling unit under a rental agreement”. Under SS 83.43(7), a “rental agreement means any written agreement, including amendments or addenda, or oral agreement for a duration of less than 1 year, providing for use and occupancy of premises”. Thus although you could be considered a tenant based on our prior agreements to occupy the home, you are NOT being asked to vacate the home “solely as it relates to non-payment of rent by residential tenants due to the COVID-19 emergency”, therefore the above Executive Order is not applicable to this memo.
 
I will then point out SS 83.20 which reads:
 
Causes for removal of tenants.—Any tenant or lessee at will or sufferance, or for part of the year, or for one or more years, of any houses, lands or tenements, and the assigns, under tenants or legal representatives of such tenant or lessee, may be removed from the premises in the manner hereinafter provided in the following cases:
 
(1) Where such person holds over and continues in the possession of the demised premises, or any part thereof, after the expiration of the person’s time, without the permission of the person’s landlord.
 
This dictates that a tenant is enabled to be removed from the home after expiration of the time limit they were granted to stay in the home by the landlord. As I am the current homeowner, that would equate me to be the landlord, therefore this provision only confirms that you should vacate the home on 31 May 2020, the expiration of [your] time.
 
I then wish to direct you to SS 83.57 which reads:
 
Termination of tenancy without specific term.—A tenancy without a specific duration, as defined in s. 83.46(2) or (3), may be terminated by either party giving written notice in the manner provided in s. 83.56(4), as follows:
 
(1) When the tenancy is from year to year, by giving not less than 60 days’ notice prior to the end of any annual period;
(2) When the tenancy is from quarter to quarter, by giving not less than 30 days’ notice prior to the end of any quarterly period;
(3) When the tenancy is from month to month, by giving not less than 15 days’ notice prior to the end of any monthly period; and
(4) When the tenancy is from week to week, by giving not less than 7 days’ notice prior to the end of any weekly period.
 
As we have never formally agreed to a time period agreement for your residency in the home you are currently residing in, the above regulations seem most applicable to our situation. Therefore, as the informal text exchange that occurred on 15 April 2020 granted you an additional 26 days of residency at the home, that is most closely associated to a “month to month” agreement. Therefore you are being afforded your right to not less than 15 days of notice prior to the aforementioned agreement ending that you are being asked to vacate the home.

After it became dark and we were unsure of how much farther ahead our designated campsite was, we chose to pick a hidden location off the trail to camp, even though it was not our official, permitted campsite. As we were packing up early the next morning, a backcountry ranger ""found"" us, and also saw me relieving myself from a distance of 300 ft or more while he was walking on the trail, and cited us with 36 CFR 2.10(b)(9) and 36 CFR 2.14(b).

I received two citations in the mail (7 months after the incident..) from an NPS ranger, requesting that I pay the collateral forfeiture, and stating a court appearance is NOT required for either citation.

When I remember all the times we've had together, spent happy and sharing. Takes something that I don’t have, and seems not worth it to see their faces when I'm gone. I'm their only one who puts them first.

48,Having serious issues getting courtdate,1589083517,"TL;DR - where the heck can I find/get notified of my court date. 

I am in Chicago, IL staying at an Airbnb. Originally from NYC. I was staying at an Airbnb last February and was arrested for criminal trespass, misdemeanor. I had only been in Chicago for two weeks. 

I had taken Ambien and apparently was sleepwalking outside and went to an apartment that I thought was my Airbnb. It wasn’t. 

All I can recall from that moment is me standing outside his gate saying “You don’t understand. I’m staying at the Airbnb and I lost my key.”

He was standing in his doorway, no porch-light, with a handgun yelling at me. I called 911, the cops came, and I don’t know what happened next but I woke up in jail and was released with a court date for March 18th. 

I have no criminal record. Since I have no idea where this happened I didn’t leave my Airbnb for two weeks and then eventually moved to another Airbnb. I have no friends or family here. All I do is sit and wait. 

Due to Covid-19, my March 18th court date was postponed to May 1st (or at least that’s what I think it was based off of what little confusing information I got from the Cook County Clerk’s website). 

And now my court date is postponed again. I had called every number I could find to get an update. Nothing. They don’t have my correct address either so I haven’t received any notifications via mail. And nothing has been sent to my NYC address. 

I had a consultation with an attorney about two weeks ago and he was able to locate my next date, June 8th. Since all dates are being rescheduled and most appearances are now being done via Zoom I don’t even know where I am to go to do this. 

The Judge’s order on their website is difficult to read and parse and he mentions the branch courts are closed so everything is being done at the main Criminal Court House. 

My mother lives in Wisconsin and I had came to the area last year to take care of her. I am self-employed, currently have no income, and keep having to pay for an Airbnb (I can’t leave the state) just so I can be in Illinois. I’m on the verge of bankruptcy. If it keeps getting postponed I will be broke, homeless. I don’t know how to apply for a job now with a court case hanging over me.

50,Tenant advice!! Landlord wants us to pay 12 months of bills that he’s never mentioned before.,1589083037,"(Philadelphia, PA) My roommate and I moved in April 2019. We were supposed to pay for all utilities. We got billed for all of them— gas, electric, etc. which we got PHYSICAL bills for in the mail and then paid through mail or making an online account. We never received a water bill, and I couldn’t make an online account with the water services because it needed my service number which was supposed to be located on my physical water bills.

So we ignored it, since our water was still running.

Now fast forward to May 2020, we’ve moved out of our year long lease. Upon asking our landlord about our security deposit being returned, he said that we have to pay him back for the 12 months of water bills that we didn’t pay.

Is this legal?? Or? We never once saw a water bill. I assume they were all billed to him since someone had to be paying them. What angers me is that if he knew the whole year that he was paying our water bills, why didn’t he mention it earlier?? He could’ve mentioned literally any time in the 12 months, “oh by the way, I’m getting your water bills delivered to my address and you need to pay them.” But he only brought it up after we asked for our security deposit.

I work at a restaurant in a small town with the highest coronavirus cases in our area. We (employees) were all told that if we didn't come back to work immediately, then we would be considered no call-no shows and they would cut our unemployment.

Naturally, everyone went back to work. We were told this was to only be a trial run to see how business was going, and that at the end of the week on Friday we would all be getting paid for the hours we worked. Business is absolutely terrible. Servers are walking out with less than $20 in their pockets. Most of the profit is from to-go orders, but tips from that are very, very rare. 

Friday (the 8th), everyone was wondering where their money was. Our boss then revealed in the middle of our shift that we would not be getting paid, and that our unemployment checks would be considered as our paychecks. I already know this shit is illegal.

He's making us work for free and is taking all the wages we are supposed to be getting to support himself and his business. This is not right. He cannot afford to pay all of us so he isn't paying us at all. Obviously, our restaurant is not fit for running yet and he should shut down, but no one can say this because he will force us to quit and cut our unemployment - cutting off any and all income.

I don't know what to do. I'm just so, so angry.

They have off campus student housing. It’s run through a third party. I’m not about to ask them questions because it could and probably would jeopardize my housing assignment for the rest of my time there. financially I can’t even dream to afford on campus housing or  even off campus housing as it’s in an expensive area. It just feels shady and I’m wondering what you guys think. They have different regulations than on campus housing. It’s feels wrong that if I were to stay in the same housing assignment for summer where I have already paid a pet deposit, they charge one again and then, they charge one in the fall for the new year.  It doesn’t come back in my pocket. It is a non refundable pet deposit IRCC. They allow pets so I’m EXTREMELY reluctant to question it but, it doesn’t feel right. Also note that I am weary of any landlord as my very first apartment in a different area of CA with my partner allowed us to rent but, asked for six months rent in advance because I didn’t have a co-signer with a decent credit score.

Obligatory 'I hope this is the right place to ask this'...

My wife and I own a house with 8.5 acres, and .3 of those acres are landlocked behind my neighbor's house two doors down. **Parcel data image for reference below**, I own the green outlined lots.  
The neighbor closest to the landlocked property is asking about buying or leasing the .3 acres. I do not want to sell, but don't mind him clearing or using the land. He's been clearing his 'back yard' and wants to clear (my) .3 extra wooded acres to use in addition to his existing property. We live in a rural area, and he'll likely be riding 4-wheelers, shooting, etc on this property if leased.

I'm trying to determine the pros/cons of leasing this land to him and how to best go about the process to protect myself. I do not want to sell the property outright as it could lead to him collecting additional property and developing (my .3 acres blocks his connection to additional property with potential development possibilities...nothing I've researching as far as zoning potential, that's just a concern I have). 

My other main concerns would be him or his family getting injured on 'my' property he's leasing, and also the concern of him 'tending' the .3 acres to any extent where he could them claim full ownership.

1) What all should I be aware of in this process (including if I do NOT lease him the land), 2) what would be the best way to go about this process to protect myself, and 3) what am I looking at as 'worst case scenario'?

They asked me and my wife if we would look after their pets, and their house for the next 3 weeks, as they needed to return to Taiwan as his mother was dying. They even left me $500 dollars for food for their 2 German Shepards. 

I don't know what happened to them, but they just never came back. I don't know if they ended up in some sort of prison, or decided to just not come home at all. Today i found out their basement had flooded, probably sometime within the last week. Apparently a pipe burst, but the entire basement is completely fucked. I paid for have the leak fixed, and i spent all of today using my shop vac to drain their basement to the best of my abilities. 

Between this and one of their dogs needing surgery i have spent several thousand dollars of my own money, and frankly the damage to the basement was pretty awful. I don't have their insurance paperwork, and don't really know if i can even do a claim for them.

On top of this his two giant German Shepards while they are amazingly good boys, it is becoming almost too much for us to handle. Their last name is extremely common, and their Facebook profiles are private. Which gives me very little avenue to tackle this down.

* July 1st, 2019 - Neighbors sent me an email stating they needed some additional time to handle his father's affairs. He apologized and said he would be back by July 15th at latest.
* July 21st, 2019 - Sent him an email asking what was going on, explained how we were going on vacation in August. Never got a response.
* July 31st, 2019 - Tried calling him on his cellphone, # he was given to me was no longer in service.
* August 14th, 2019 - Went on vacation, had my brother look after all 4 dogs, for the next week.
* September 2nd, 2019 - Emailed him again, no response.
* September 3rd, 2019 - Tried to reach him and his wife via Facebook using the private message feature.
* September 6th, 2019 - Ended up moving his 2 dogs, 1 cat into our house as they seemed extremely miserable. I ended up disassembling part of our adjoined fence to allow his dogs to use their outdoor area.
* November 19th, 2019 - One of his dogs started showing signs of being ill, brought him to the vet turns out he is suffering from a medium severity case of IVDD. He ended up requiring surgery which we paid for.
* January 21st, 2020 - Sent another email and never got a response.
* Today - When i was bringing his mail in to his house, i noticed it smelled pretty awful and i quickly discovered his basement had about a foot of water in it.

They seem to think that the space in front of their house (that I believe they rent, possibly section 8) is solely for them to park in.  They will take up room for two vehicles with their one vehicle when possible.  They also throw fits if anyone parks in ""their"" space.  Not to their face, but as soon as that person leaves or goes inside.  Loud enough for the whole block to hear.  They have taken a particular dislike to me and my friend, because we park wherever is open based on how other people have parked.  This neighbor has never spoken to us, or asked us to change anything.  They just started bitching about us.  At first we thought to just ignore it and they would stop, but they are escalating.

96,Illegal ppp activity,1589077859,"I am a server struggling with some sketchy things related to the owner
Yesterday, we were informed the money owner received from the PPP loan has run out just after 3 weeks when we were told it would go until June. All the FOH and BOH are to return to normal wages. The majority of the workers believe this to be untrue and think fraud is being committed. Our hopes are he can be investigated.

The owner has altered out time cards as well as the pay period to how he sees fit. We were supposed to be paid last night, Friday the 8th, and received no paycheck. He claims he paid us early last time and we have another week until we are paid. We were just informed of this last night. None of us were aware.

We find it suspicious that a policy book came out days before opening that was mandatory to sign before returning to work. We have never had any sort of policy book up until now. Many of the points in this policy are rather suspicious.

This previous week I and another server have found ourselves in an uncomfortable situation where we needed to report the restaurant to proper sanitation department for breaking the reopening procedures. He allowed a group of his own friend to sit together. This composed of 9 adults. He also allowed customers to sit at the bar. 

When we got ahold of him about our concerns over the phone his response was simply ""ok"". No action was taken.

The sanitation department called me back and informed me that he told them it was a disgruntled employee and a lie. The next day he approached me and another few workers and said that they know an inside employee reported him. He said they were a liar and he planned to find out who it was. A few days later I found my hours were cut back on the new schedule even though I was told I would need to work 21 hours. I was told it was because we aren't busy enough for me to work as much. However, another server that needed 21 hours was schedule even MORE than the previous week. Including shifts I lost. I believe the owner is discriminating against me for calling in. I now find myself needing to apply for unemployment again. I worry I won't have a job much longer and theres no way to prove this

During the shutdown, those who continued to work for takeouts didn't see any tips. The owner claimed they were being saved to pay the employees once we opened back up. We were also asked to work without clocking in. Our Sous Chef who was on salary was paying the back of the house out of his own pocket to assist him in the kitchen. He didn't receive any of the take-out tips despite the workload being immense.

The salary workers were asked to lie about their hours on unemployment and only report 10 hours but continue working the full 40. He then said he would pay out of his personal bank account whatever unemployment didn't cover for their salary wages.

Another occurrence was when the staff all met together for a meeting before reopening. We were told we could come back to work but only for 75% of the hours we have been working. This was so we could remain unemployed. Everyone was quickly kicked off unemployment after returning to work...We were lied to. He claimed it was the government's fault and we were all lazy.

Even though we were told we would be working 75% of our hours we were only allowed to come in a couple of hours then management adjusted our hours to see fit.

It was brought up that we weren't being paid for 75% like we were promised and some of us were shorted an hour or two on our paychecks. When asked, the owner simply stated that the government isn't black and white. He can't pay us exactly 75% of our old hours because it would look odd.

97,Our lawyer is offering us $50K from a settlement and I haven’t even gone to court. Is something wrong here?,1589077702,"I will try to keep this short and to the point without missing any key details. 

I will refer to my moms common-law partner as her “husband” for simplicity sake. 

My mom and her partner (common-law marriage) were planning on buying a property together about 3 years ago (yes it’s been that long, if not more.) My mom filed for bankruptcy in 2010 so it would’ve been very difficult for her to get a mortgage alone but her husband‘s credit score and history was pretty well. They decided to purchase a property together and my mom would put $50,000 in for the down payment. The mortgage broker asked that we put the money into one account for the bank statements. So she did this just a couple days before the appointment with mortgage broker/bank. The day of the appointment we find out that he went to the mortgage broker alone. He ended up putting only his name on the paperwork and got approved for the house. We don’t even know how this happened or if he made some sketchy deal with the mortgage broker. 

After this happened he started to get more and more abusive towards my mom, probably as a way to get her away from the house. We then find out, he’s still married to his ex wife in Jordan. 

We didn’t have a lot of money to pay upfront for a lawyer so we retained a lawyer for $5000 and and agreed that he’d take a percentage from the settlement. It’s been almost 4 years now and there has been no progress. He filed a motion against him only a couple months ago and he told us last year ... during the only mediation that we had, that he would be putting a lien on the house. 

Last week we find out that the house was sold, and he made a profit of $200,000. I don’t understand how this house is sold if there was a lien on it. The sketchy part is that the lawyer offered us $50,000 for June 1 and then would continue to sue him and sue the land registry for other damages. Again, this case has taken almost 3 years. Our lawyer knew about her ex husband buying a new home, how much he bought the new home for and where his address is. I dont know how he got this information but the whole thing is very sketchy. He said that he’s offering us this money just out of the goodness of his heart and he feels sorry for my mom and that she’s been through a lot but to be honest with you he’s always been so disrespectful and rude towards us and has always avoided us. Because we don’t have thousands of dollars just laying around it was hard for us to retain a new lawyer and so much time has also passed by. 

So our main issue is - he stole that $50,000 from my
Mom, he abused her emotionally. He tarnished her name and reputation within our family and we don’t want settle for the initial $50k, is it unrealistic to sue for more? 

Also - is the lawyer allowed to do this? We asked another lawyer and he said that there could be a possibility that he made a personal deal with her ex-husband and his lawyer and might have already taken his share of the money.",legaladvice,False,hyrdoflouridequeen,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggt3vf/our_lawyer_is_offering_us_50k_from_a_settlement/

99,Help finding court that keeps getting postponed,1589077597,"TL;DR - where the heck can I find/get notified of my court date?


I know there is LegalAdvice (no answer) but there’s always someone on here that knows something. 



I am in Chicago, IL staying at an Airbnb. Originally from NYC. I was staying at an Airbnb last February and was arrested for criminal trespass, misdemeanor. I had only been in Chicago for two weeks. 


I had taken Ambien and apparently was sleepwalking outside and went to an apartment that I thought was my Airbnb. It wasn’t. 


All I can recall from that moment is me standing outside his gate saying “You don’t understand. I’m staying at the Airbnb and I lost my key.”


He was standing in his doorway, no porch-light, with a handgun yelling at me. I called 911, the cops came, and I don’t know what happened next but I woke up in jail and was released with a court date for March 18th. 


I have no criminal record. Since I have no idea where this happened I didn’t leave my Airbnb for two weeks and then eventually moved to another Airbnb. I have no friends or family here. All I do is sit and wait. 


Due to Covid-19, my March 18th court date was postponed to May 1st (or at least that’s what I think it was based off of what little confusing information I got from the Cook County Clerk’s website). 

And now my court date is postponed again. I had called every number I could find to get an update. Nothing. They don’t have my correct address either so I haven’t received any notifications via mail. And nothing has been sent to my NYC address. 


I had a consultation with an attorney about two weeks ago and he was able to locate my next date, June 8th. Since all dates are being rescheduled and most appearances are now being done via Zoom I don’t even know where I am to go to do this. 


The Judge’s order on their website is difficult to read and parse and he mentions the branch courts are closed so everything is being done at the main Criminal Court House. 


My mother lives in Wisconsin and I had came to the area last year to take care of her. I am self-employed, currently have no income, and keep having to pay for an Airbnb (I can’t leave the state) just so I can be in Illinois. I’m on the verge of bankruptcy. If it keeps getting postponed I will be broke, homeless. I don’t know how to apply for a job now with a court case hanging over me. 


My questions - is there a way (which doesn’t involve me having to endure virtual capital punishment) for me to contact someone to get my new court date and is it possible to petition the Court for an emergency hearing? 


I realize the answer may be “call the Clerk’s office”. I have. Close to 100 times as well as any other number I could locate that I thought would be helpful.

8,My father died and my aunt refuses to give us his briefcase which has important legal papers we need,1589076926,"Long shot anyone will see but I’m at the end of my rope and would appreciate any advice. 

My dad died this year in January. He wasn’t the best but he did love us. I miss him a lot. Anyway, my aunt (his sister) decided to take it upon herself to keep his briefcase, which as stated before, has important legal papers (such as land ownership) and other items that my mom needs. 

My father and my mother did not have a good relationship. My dad battled with alcoholism which made him become verbally abusive and unbearable when drunk, which was all the time. They lived in a constant shouting match for the last ten years. My mom finally searched for a divorce lawyer but never actually did anything to start the divorce process. My dad somehow found out about it and just gave up on everything. His health deteriorated and he met an early death. 

During his stay at the hospital, my dad had his briefcase with him and told my aunt to take care of his things for the moment. He didn’t know he was going to die. No one had any idea what the hell was going to happen. But she took that as binding and now refuses to let go of it, much less acknowledge she has it even though everyone knows she possesses it. Since my dad’s death, my aunt has turned the rest of the sisters  and grandmother against my mom and have ostracized her. To the point that she wishes to leave the home she built with my dad from the ground up (my aunt is our neighbor).

My mom has expressed anger and desire to bring her to justice, but has yet to do anything. 

Which brings me to the legal part of this, is there anything I can do that will force her to return my dad’s belongings to us? If we can’t, is there a possibility my aunt could screw us over due to having the papers? i.e. take my sisters and I out of the land ownership and keep everything to herself?

10,Arizona. Ex-husband lied about income on modification of child support form. Any advice on the best course of action?,1589076839,"Hi r/legaladvice,

I'm actually writing on behalf of my partner. We're unmarried but live together, in case that is relevant. A couple months ago, my partner was served papers ordering her to appear in court (the actual court date has been postponed, due to covid), because her ex filed for a modification of child support. His reasoning for filing for a modification is that one of the children from their marriage has turned 18 since the original child support determination. He wants to pay my partner less each month. Which is kind of a gross signal to send to your kid, IMO, but whatever.

The ex has a regular salaried job but also sells real estate. On the child support modification form he only included his salary; however, on the 2019 tax information he supplied to my partner (at around the same time he filed the modification form) he included his salary **and** earnings from real estate sales. It's clear that he understated his income by what amounts to tens of thousands of dollars for the year. He's petty, vindictive, and abusive. So, neither my partner nor I have any doubt he's doing this just to avoid paying her and to try and make her life more difficult. It's his thing. I realize it's not illegal to be a shitbag, but misrepresenting your income to a court has to at least be frowned upon, right? What is her best course of action, here? Is there anything in particular that she ought to consider, but might overlook as a layperson?

12,"Our neighbor keeps accusing us/our children of throwing rocks in his yard. Today, he claimed to have video proof and called the cops.",1589076679,"This has been going on for several months. It started with him approaching me while I checked the mail to ask if my kids were throwing rocks in his yard, or if we noticed rocks being thrown into our yard. Our yard is desert landscape aka full of rocks, but I told him I doubted my kids were doing it because (among other things) they’re young (2,4,7)/can’t throw well, plus our walls are pretty high. Every once in while he would catch me while out walking his dog or even just come up to our door if he noticed it was open to ask us if we were absolutely sure our kids weren’t throwing rocks. 

Shortly after the stay at home orders started, I was letting my dog out one morning and he was up against the corner of wall where our yards meet, doing something with his trees. It looked like he was installing floodlights that pointed into his yard, and I didn’t give it much thought. He asked me, again, if my kids were throwing rocks (I said no) then tried to act nice by offering me hand sanitizer. I said no thanks and went back inside. When my husband looked out to see what he was doing a little while later, he was installing a camera on the back of the palm tree up against the corner, pointed strait into our yard. Not even cleverly hidden, it was point blank, practically *in* our yard. My husband was disturbed, but approached our neighbor calmly and asked him to take it down. Our kids play back there, and sometimes they’re naked. He took it down pretty quickly - quick enough that by the time we thought about it, we weren’t able to get a picture. However, he reinstalled it pointing into our neighbors yard, and we’ve always wondered whether it could see a little into our yard too. Later he came over to talk to my husband and apologize. He explained the damage these rocks were doing to his property were stressing him out. My husband is a handyman, and gave our neighbor his number, offering to help him with repairs for free if provided the materials. Then he actually showed us one of the rocks he found on his roof. It didn’t match the rocks in our yard, so we thought it was finally settled. 

Since then, almost every time the guy hears us doing something loud in the backyard, he texts my husband. One time I was scolding the kids for dumping water into their sandbox, and he immediately texted my husband to ask if I caught them throwing rocks. I moved their swing set into the shade and he texts my husband asking if I’m mad or something (like he thought I was shoveling up a pile of rocks in preparation of a throwing contest later I don’t even fucking know). He asks us why our porch light is on, why our blinds are open, why the dog is barking, etc. 

I have been in the hospital with our 4 year old since Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday he texted husband about the kids throwing rocks again, but he and our other kids and had been in and out of the house, they were currently napping and had yet to play in the yard all day. My husband kind of snapped. I don’t know what he said exactly, but I know he told him about the situation with our son and assumed the guy would back off for a while. 

Onto today. My husband left the house early this morning (around 8) to help my parents with something, do some shopping, then bring me lunch. As he’s heading out to me, our neighbor calls and says he finally caught us, claiming to have a video of rocks being thrown into his yard from ours. My husband heads back home to diffuse the situation. He contemplated calling 311 and filing a harassment report, but thought it might just make things worse and decided to drop it for the day. An hour ago, the cops show up. Our neighbor called, showed them the video, and filed a report. My kids are no longer suspected, my husband is, and if the neighbor calls them about this again, he can go to jail for assault. 

My husband wants to just move and be done with it. We rent, so having the rocks removed or even having our own security system installed is not something we can just do, but I’m about to bring home a preschooler who just had brain surgery - it’s not like we can move tomorrow.

(I don't know much about taxes, so I may have got some of the terminology wrong)

When I submitted my tax forms for 2018, I accidentally claimed myself as a dependent. When my mom also claimed me, her taxes didn't go through. This happened a long time ago, but I guess it wasn't caught. With an accountant's help, we resubmitted our forms like 2 months ago. She tells us that it's gonna take like six months to fully process.

From what I understand, you're not supposed to get a stimulus check if you're somebody's dependent. I just checked my mail, and I got a letter saying that my stimulus check has been direct deposited. I have two bank accounts, and I had $1,200 deposited into the one I don't check often (it's like my super savings back account, I put money there and basically don't look at it so I'm not tempted to use it). 

Is this going to be an issue when it comes to redoing our tax forms to make me my mom's dependent for 2018? Is this fraud? I mean, all those mistakes were made before corona was even a thing on the western world's radar.

my boyfriend (M17) came out as transgender years ago, and a few months before now he went out to start gender confirmation therapy. his dad (divorced, not living with him) who is anything but supportive, got extremely upset and took him off of his insurance. he hasn’t had insurance for quite some time now, and has no way to get it in the near future. he’s applied for state insurance but the process is lengthy and difficult for him to get through alone.

for background, he has a host of serious mental illnesses that cause him to have a lot of harmful habits and dangerous suicidal tendencies. the covid19 crisis has made him extremely anxious too, as he was born without a trachea and has breathing issues that put him at risk. he relied on medication and therapy to keep himself in a mentally and physically stable place for years, but now all of that is completely cut off. he doesn’t have nearly enough money to get any help without insurance.

i’m watching him spiral out of control, all because his dad doesn’t want him to start transitioning if he got to that point. he was exposed to and had symptoms of covid a few weeks back and didn’t have any money to receive medical help if he needed it. it feels cruel that his own father could put his child’s health and safety at risk, then go home to his other family of three young kids.

Shes now claiming he doesnt have a life insurance policy, she wont allow us on the property because we had a major falling out due to her behavior. Her nieces are harassing my family, and threatening us.

My girlfriend is an adjuster, and is somewhat familiar with property laws, and said that I have legal rights to community property in the state of Texas.

We are under the assumption that he does have one and shes lying, which is fine because she would likely be the beneficiary but... my father was planning on leaving her when he took this job and if she isnt lying and they arent giving her information on this policy, it may be in my name.

22,"[US-PA] Currently fostering a dog. He was neutered, but the operation failed. Vet was pretty neglectful of him. Whole situation is a bit confusing but details are in the description.",1589075643,"Sorry if any formatting issues, I'm on mobile.


I have absolutely no idea what flair this should be under, mods please feel free to change it or message me or whatever.


Ok, let's start from the beginning. 


My mom and I volunteer at an animal rescue located in Pennsylvania. We loved this one dog, let's call Scruffy. We decided to foster him during this whole coronavirus thing. At the time we began fostering him, he was not neutered. 


We've fostered him for about 2 weeks, and a few days ago was his operation, as planned. In the morning that we dropped him off, the lady at the animal rescue said to us that she would call us once the operation was complete. We never received any call.


My mom got worried, and about 10 hours after we dropped him off for his operation, she decided to go to the rescue to check up on him. When she got there, no employees were there, only a few volunteers. She found him in a tiny crate in the side room. He was sitting in his pee without any food or water. Had she not gone there, he would have been in a small crate for at least 14 hours without any food or water and a lack of sanitary conditions. We asked a volunteer if there was any pain medication left for him, but there wasn't any.


At this point, we think everything is over and it might have just been a communication error. But nope.


A day later, we go in to volunteer at the rescue, and the manager of it says that the surgery failed. They could only find 1 testicle and that they had to cut him open in several areas to see if they could find the other one, but to no avail. They did not have a CT scanner or MRI or whatever, so they were digging in the dark.


My mom asked for any pain medicine, and the manager literally said ""It's good that he feels pain"" and denied our request. She also said that he would get a second surgery sometime in the future, and I'm assuming they would try the same thing over again without a CT scan.


Right now, the dog is in pain, doesn't have any pain medicine, and was operated on without the necessary medical equipment to perform that operation (a CT scanner). We're terrified he will go in for a second surgery and will end up in more pain.


We want to take this dog to an unrelated and more professional veterinarian to get the operation done right, or to, at the very least, get him pain medication. Again, we are only fostering this dog, and we have no intention of keeping him long-term. 


Can we take him to a vet? Could the animal rescue do anything against us if we did that? From the short description I gave, are they doing anything criminal/animal abuse?",legaladvice,False,mattbernss,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggskyx/uspa_currently_fostering_a_dog_he_was_neutered/

It's a small family business owned by wealthy Indians and she has recently experienced some mental health issues arising from stress and in my opinion a significant amount of brainwashing and bullying from the family. Due to these issues, she has been asked to sign a contract for a settlement to stand down which just seems insulting seeing how loyal and hard-working she has been. The boss constantly calls and messages after hours. Any advice on whether what he's doing is legal (I know it's not immoral and downright wrong) and at all fair. There is evidence to take him to fair work in Australia, but my wife is so fragile atm that she does not even want to think about that path. Please help us.

42,NYC - Roommate Is Intending To Stay Past Lease End - Is Risking My Security Deposit,1589074070,"Hi all. Am in a bit of a pickle and am reaching out as this sub often has sound advice on legal issues.

I currently occupy an apartment with two roommates in NYC, one who's a friend and the master tenant on the lease and another person who we found on Craigslist a year ago. The latter roommate is insinuating that they intend to squat in the space beyond May 31st, which is when the current lease ends. She's been a real nutcase, and is the main reason why we've made plans to leave the apartment when the lease ends.

This would, as the landlord has made known, cost us all our security deposits (the same roommate is currently unemployed and already used her deposit to cover this month). I tried to argue with the landlord that I should get my share of my deposit back since I had given 45-day notice but she's making it contingent on *everyone* being out of the space by May 31st so she can rent out the space to other tenants. I totally get her side as well. What's my recourse here?

49,Signing a lease without knowing about college classes,1589073588,"Hi folks! I'm based in Los Angeles, CA and have some questions before my friends and I sign a lease. It's a long one, I'm sorry!

Background: I'm a college student and a group of 4 friends (also students) and I were planning on living in a house nearby campus next semester (5 of us total). The house is owned by a private student housing company so the process is pretty easy, we'd all be co-signers. We were supposed to sign the lease in March, but were delayed in signing because one person in the group had trouble with his background check - a necessary prerequisite to signing - and we've kind of dropped the ball since then. Around two weeks ago, I got an email from the housing company saying that someone else had outbid us on monthly rent by $2000 and that we would have to sign the lease within a week if we wanted to keep the house. I said we would try our best and pushed the guy to sort out his background check issue. Unfortunately, he was only able to get it resolved yesterday. In the past two weeks, I hadn't heard from the housing company, but when I emailed them yesterday about his background check being complete and asking whether the house was still available for us at the originally agreed-on price, they said that it was available and did not mention the other group, who had supposedly outbid us, at all. This makes me think they were bluffing to try to get us to sign the lease quicker. 

The problem: Now that we're actually able to sign the lease, we have another problem. Our college has not yet confirmed whether or not the Fall semester will be going online - and will only be confirming this at the end of June (classes start mid-August). For me, moving in with my parents is not an option so I would still need housing if next semester is online. But everyone else in our group would no longer need the housing if next semester is online - either they would take a leave of absence or take classes from their parents' houses. As such, we're now pretty nervous about signing the lease. If classes are in-person, we will definitely still want the house, but we don't want to be stuck in a lease if classes are online. Even though I need housing, if classes are online I could instead live in a 1BR apartment or a studio which would be more expensive than my share of the house (not ideal) but cheaper than all 5 of us having to pay rent for a property that only I live in.

We have two options right now: Sign, or don't sign and hope that it's still available in June. My main question is: **If we sign the lease, but classes end up being online, is there any way to get out of that lease?** The housing company has said that they would not let us out of the lease if classes are online, but is there a legal way we could? I know that the law isn't always fair, but it seems unfair that we'd have to commit to something so expensive and set-in-stone when this pandemic is so uncertain. My second question is: **Is it likely that the company was bluffing about the other group outbidding us ie. is this something that housing companies often do?** If we don't sign the lease and instead try to hold off until the end of June when a decision about classes is made, should we still try to get this house?  If they were bluffing, I doubt they'll get any other group to sign at a higher rent than what we'd be paying, so I'd feel safe holding off until June. But if there really is another group and we're racing to sign the lease, and there'd be no way to get out of the lease if we do sign, then I'd need to look into other housing options as soon as possible. I'd appreciate any answers to either of these questions!

Some notes/preemptive replies: 

* I'm definitely not going to abandon this group and just sign my own 1BR lease. Firstly, an apartment is out of my price range and I'd have to go into debt every month to pay rent. This is the worst-case scenario. Secondly, if I ditched the group and they still signed the lease, they'd be short one person and would probably struggle to find someone else to commit - I'm not going to do that to them. Thirdly, I hate living alone and would only do it if I absolutely had no other option.
* Please don't try to predict whether or not the college will go online. We've been playing those well-informed guessing games for weeks and the conclusion is truly that no one knows! I know many other colleges are going online, but ours is also very determined to open in person so who knows!
* There are other houses in the area that would suit our needs and are in the same price range, but we'd likely have the same issue if we went for another house - the dilemma of signing a binding lease versus risking someone else signing before us and snatching up the house. All the student housing companies in the area operate in the same way and we wouldn't get different treatment by choosing a different house owned by a different company. (We know from friends who are in similar positions)
* None of us is rich! We're all in positions where if it's at all possible to live rent-free  (ie. move back in with parents) we're going to. No one in the group (aside from me) would be willing/able to pay rent and live in the house if they're taking online classes that could be taken from their parents' house.",legaladvice,False,0113j,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggs1si/signing_a_lease_without_knowing_about_college/

51,"Got rear-ended, at-fault driver wants to pay out of pocket otherwise file claim with 50/50 fault",1589073556,"Hi all, I'm in a bit of a unique situation so any insights would be helpful. Here are the details:

1. I got rear-ended after I slowed down to yield to traffic after exiting highway (no yield sign but there was pedestrian crossing sign)
2. During the exchange of info, at-fault driver kept mentioning it's my fault saying that I shouldn't slow down since I have the whole lane to myself etc. I verbally admitted fault since I thought there are no repercussions. The at-fault driver has a brother at the scene who witnessed my admission of fault.
3. At-fault driver is 18 years old. His parents offered to pay out of pocket to avoid huge premium increases.
4. They are willing to pay up to $5K. The initial estimate from the body shop is about $2.5K based on visible damages. It will go up for sure if they discovered hidden damages after pulling out the bumper.

Communicated with at-fault driver by phone and we arrived at the following strategy:

1. I take my car to the body shop again, let them pull out the bumper, and get back the final estimate with hidden damages included.
2. If the final estimate is less than $5K, we agreed to settle out of pocket.
3. But here's the tricky part, if the final estimate is more than $5K, the at-fault driver wants to claim insurance based on 50/50 fault. I just feel that this is ridiculous since I was the one who got rear-ended while slowing down at a pedestrian crossing. However, the at-fault driver strong-armed me by saying that he got a witness (his brother) to testify that I admitted fault.

Personally, I feel it's safer going the insurance route but I don't want to be the one determined as at-fault in this case, as my insurance premium will go up as well. Currently, I'm inclined towards the out-of-pocket option. Although it's definitely riskier for me, I could be saving some money by avoiding premium increases over the long run.

56,[NY] Neighbor wants access to yard for service trucks,1589073206,"A tree from the neighboring house's back yard has fallen onto it.

* I'm a new homeowner, of a few months.
* The damage from the tree doesn't look like it's, e.g. collapsed the roof but it looks pretty heavy and is probably putting some load on it.
* The house itself is pretty neglected and I don't think anybody's currently living in it.
* My yard is also pretty neglected. (I've prioritized work inside the house first.) They probably assumed I don't care about my yard but I don't want to give up the ability to make it nice.

65,“Friend” is saying I drugged him.,1589072203,"Mods, I wasn’t sure where to post this, so help me move it around if I need to. Thanks. 

A few weeks ago + 1 day, I’m with friend 1 as he trips on psychedelic mushrooms to ensure that he is safe and responsible and doesn’t get anxious or anything like that. It was a very personal moment, and I felt entirely trusted by him. He had a bit of anxiety, but it was overall not too bad for him. 

A few weeks ago, my group of (college) friends (including friend 1) was waking up in the morning to watch the stock market. I’ve been trading the longest of my friends and my laptop was going to die, so the newest trader (first week) asked to come back to my dorm with me if I saw any stock market plays to call out. I obliged, and we talked about fitness and health supplements on the way there. 

He mentioned Lion’s mane mushroom, which is a non-psychoactive substance that we both evidently take that is said to enhance general cognitive function, mood and memory. I showed him some of the health supplements I take, and he saw that I had two bottles of lions mane powder, so he asked to have one. I gave him the one that I had that was already opened. Big mistake. 

Some days go by, and he apparently goes home that weekend and takes a lot of this lion’s mane and smokes a bowl of weed, and somehow ends up breaking his toe by falling off of a tree (no idea why he was in a tree) and having a horrifying trip. I know nothing until another friend in our group, friend 2, calls me one night and says friend 1 (Lions Mane guy) is freaking out and “needs to talk to me”.

I go down and of course meet with my friends, and friend 1 tells me about his experience and asks if it’s possible I could’ve mixed some kind of psychedelic drug into the powder, to which I of course say that’s not possible (it really isn’t possible). He seems to trust that, but then at the end of our short 1-hour meeting, he looks at me suddenly and asks “why did you give me the opened container?” 

I tell him that it was because he could buy the stuff on amazon and have it here in 2-3 days, so I gave him the smaller supply since I bought it for myself to use. He doesn’t take it, and I can tell. He says that his parents have sent the Lions Mane I gave him off to a lab to get tested. 

Now, fast forward two weeks, he hasn’t spoken to me either time I’ve reached out to him asking how he was doing/if the test results came in, and he doesn’t answer either time, but he opens the message.

Now, I’m on trial it seems with my fraternity (which we’re both members of) because he told them that I drugged him. A friend on the executive committee showed me screenshots of a home ehrlic reagent test kit, not results from a lab test, and it shows that there are “LSD analogues” and “DMT” in the powder I gave him.

I found some people on Reddit saying that they had bad “psychedelic” experiences with marijuana after taking mushrooms (just google “weed ruined after shrooms) similar to his, so prior to seeing these test results I had confidence that I could defend my case and explain what I thought had happened to make him “trip” at his house that day. 

I’ve never had access to either of those substances, and I’m trying to figure out what to do before our fraternity next decides to meet about this because there’s NO WAY that I could’ve done this.

&amp;#x200B;

as of late, i have been the target of what feels to be harassment and quite honestly i dont know what to do. basically, this all goes back to feb of this year. my stepfather had the police called on him, and this kid (lets call him Jay) walked by my house and he sees the cop cars. me and jay go back, but we dont have a good relationship.

jay goes around and tells a lot of people that go to my school that i was arrested for child pornography (we're both minors, 15). he also makes up false accusations and tells those same people that my parents are divorcing (and that its my fault, to add to injury). 

jay also gets some of his friends to take pictures of my house and send them to me via an unregistered landline on skype.

in the moment when he first got his people to start this shit, i did say in the heat of the moment i would jump him. i have since apologized multiple times, saying that it was in the heat of the moment.

She has no written contract with the landlord (NJ).,1589070572,"Hi, I'm asking for guidance on behalf of a friend, who has rented several rooms in a house from another couple for five years. The couple and my friend get along swimmingly, probably enhanced by  by the fact that my friend worked nights and weekends (the home has seperate entrances) and they worked normal M-F 9-5's. But the quarantine has caused the couple's marriage to start to unravel, to the point where my friend thinks their marital fights have become a source of shame and embarrassment for them. Although my friend has continued (and can continue) to pay rent and is on friendly terms with her hosts, she was given 30 days notice and asked to leave. This presents a number of challenges:

1. My friend has never had a written contract. Their agreement was that the rent was $850/mo, and 30 days notice could end the arrangement on either side.

2. My friend works for a generations-old business that is very likely to survive COVID, but she is currently collecting unemployment because the company is non-essential. She is technically unemployed (but has been promised her job whenever they can re-open) when seeking new accomodations, and worried that will present a challenge.  

4. She is very poor. She lives frugally, but her income level makes it hard to find accomodations in our very wealthy area in northern NJ she can afford. Studio apartments seem to start around 30% more than what she's paying in rent. 

Although I know it would be unpleasant because of the shared common areas, is it possible that, as an absolute last resort, any of the eviction protections in place for contracted apartments might also apply to my friend during this time, at least to give her a few extra weeks to find something else?

79,Unmarried Visitation Rights (OH/AK),1589070426,"Some backstory: I gave birth to my almost 5 year old child in Ohio. He was 24, I was 26 at the time. The father and I were already separated when I found out I was pregnant (drug use, him lying to me about why he was really on probation, and his friends planning to drug my food led to me ending things between us). When I found out I was pregnant I was instantly accused of lying to him that I was on birth control (I never told him I was), getting pregnant on purpose to trap him, and being a gold digger. He wanted me to get an abortion, he even offered to pay me to get an abortion on the stipulation that he be there when I got it done. I refused. I told him if he didn't want the kid he didn't have to be in our lives. Over the course of my pregnancy I nearly miscarried a couple of times due to the stress he and his friend were putting on me, telling me what a terrible person I was for forcing him into fatherhood by continuing with my pregnancy.
Well I gave birth to my child early, my child was underweight and small, immediately diagnosed with failure to thrive, had to be on preemie formula for the first six months.

He wasn't there for the birth. Later on he accuses me of lying to him, he's not the father, the baby's skin color is too light. He wants a DNA test. He refuses to sign either the birth certificate papers or paternity affidavit.

I go to child support. They do the DNA test. He is the father. He doesn't show up for the child support determination. The attorney when I asked about if he gets visitation and rights now told me that its separate, child support has nothing to do with it, it just makes him obligated to pay, if he wants his rights he'd have to go to family court for that and establish them. And after everything he did to me mentally and emotionally I didn't feel safe. I also ended up learning that the felonious assault charge he was on probation for was originally an attempted murder charge that got dropped to a lesser charge. And yes I was too stupid at the beginning to google him. I wrongfully believed that doing so would be an invasion of his privacy.

Two years later he continues to show no interest in having a relationship with his daughter, he'd come see her maybe once or twice in the two years since child support was determined. Though we lived in the same city and it was easy for him to stop by at any time. There was always a third adult there for safety. And he became progressively more abusive towards me. If I didn't do as he wanted he would get angry and accuse me of making the father of my child feel terrible ""Why would you make the father of your child feel this way? You're a terrible mother to make her father feel like this. I wish things between us would go back to the way they were BEFORE.""

I was and still am scared of him, his schizophrenia makes him violent and he refuses to seek help for it despite past incidents. To him he doesn't have a mental illness. And the more drugs he does the worse it gets.

When my child was 2 ½ years old I got the opportunity to move to Alaska and took her with me. The move took almost everything I had and I didn't tell him. His worsening outbursts had me terrified. He took to hanging around my work and would accuse me of sleeping with my male coworkers if he so much as saw me joking with them on the job. He would call me a whore, a slut, that I was sleeping around on him even though we no longer had any kind of romantic relationship between us.

He had shown to me time and again he had no interest in developing a father/child relationship with her. I felt I'd given him ample time to prove to me he really wanted to be in her life and take the necessary legal actions in court that would establish his rights. And with the attorneys words still in the back of my mind I made my decision. 

Now 2 years in Alaska I've heard from him only twice and it was to tell me what a deadbeat mother I was, what a piece of shit I am (his friend also messaged me to tell me this).

Some people have told me I am denying him visitation rights as I've subsequently blocked him on everything to put a stop to the verbal attacks. We still have one mutual friend between us and I haven't changed employers in 4 years and he knows where I'm living. Child support has my contact information though he has stopped sending regular payments. He recently created a new facebook account to contact me again and blame me for most of his stimulus check being taken by child support. And again to tell me what a deadbeat mother I am.

My question is, if he ever wants to pursue a court order for visitation would I have to travel all the way back to Ohio for this or would he have to come up to Alaska? Neither of us are exceptionally well off, I work retail and he blames the pandemic for his not paying child support this time though he's only sent in one payment in over 6 months because child support said they would start legal proceedings if he didn't.",legaladvice,False,RogueKhajit,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggr6q1/unmarried_visitation_rights_ohak/

83,How to breach of contract/quit under Sinclair Broadcast Group contract?,1589070028,"I've been a producer at my local news station for almost two years and it has been a living hell. 

I'm under a 3-year contract as of now and I'm ready to move on as I am not given any opportunity for advancement. 

I have several years of background experience in journalism along with 6 accolades for my work. I wanted to give television a shot after the newspaper I worked for had to make staff cuts. 

I applied for the reporter position and was offered the producer position instead, but with a negotiated salary. The News Director at the time hired me and said I was about six months behind in television reporting experience but there would be more open opportunities for me within the company.  With that, I signed the contract. 

However, that News Director resigned and his replacement is the worst the entire newsroom has experienced. 

I applied for an Executive Producer position and he turned me down, saying, ""Although you have the education, experience, and integrity, there's a personality issue."" Instead, he hired one of my coworkers who is my senior, but has no degree or experience in journalism, as this is her first newsroom job. However, she later quit. 

He also said this to another experienced female manager who tried to apply as Assistant News Director; she was turned down and told the same thing. This manager then addressed her concerns to the General Manager, whom also is a female, and told her she ""needs to stop playing victim"". 

Since then, I applied for two other positions and was still passed over, this time, for lack of experience. However, I noticed he started hiring more employees that did not have needed experience; many of my coworkers have complained about their work because they have not been trained and or had to learn on their own. 

He has gotten in trouble for encouraging other employees to apply for positions but then does not choose them. We've had a few people leave because of it. 

Speaking of, I learned that he offered the EP positions the rest of the producers, whom have no experience and this is their first job. He dodged me again. But they all turned it down because nobody wants to work for him on that level. 

He also even said to me, ""Our producers aren't experienced, they've only worked on projects. You were an exception though, because you have a background."" 

Yet, I'm not good enough for any promotion. 

Meanwhile, a few women have reported sexual harassment against him, as he tends to check out butts and legs. We've had two female managers quit after reporting him. He was required to have private meetings with women with another manager behind closed doors, but then he later ignored it. 

He has also asked my coworkers to show him their bills to see if they can afford certain things. 

He has also expressed that he did not promote an experienced reporter to an anchor position simply because he didn't like him for him, either. 

At one point, he also embarrassed me in front of my coworkers after an agreement with me. We were limited on resources for our shows at the time and I asked him if it would be OK if I could present the show differently. He said it was fine, with other coworkers agreeing. 

The next day at our daily meeting, he said in front of everyone that my show was failure because of how I presented it. I said right then and there, ""I thought we had an agreement"". He later pulled me into his office saying he didn't appreciate me calling him out and I need to take criticism better. My coworkers that witnessed this encouraged me to keep this on record, as many of us felt it was inappropriate. 

Long story short, many people have complained about this dude to our General Manager. I even talked to her with a group of my coworkers about our concerns. Apparently, she is trying to make a case to fire him, although that has yet to happen, probably delayed by the coronavirus. 

I would really like to leave as this has taken a toll on my confidence, mental health, relationships, and overall quality of life. I have been on antidepressants for a year now and I have to change my career path to better myself after this. 

 Right now, both the News Director and General Manager are angry at me because:

1. I pushed the initiative that producers should work from home due to the risks of COVID-19.
2. I recently called out for the week as I have had symptoms for COVID-19 but tested negative. 

There are monetary repercussions when it comes to breaching and getting out of this contract. I am hoping to not have to pay due to the evidence I could possibly present to HR, although they may be aware of it. 

How can I go about breaching this contract due to these conditions?

91,About to file a complaint against a competitor for Trademark Infringement. Trying to get a feel for my probability of success.,1589069159,"Hey folks! TIA for any and all advice. 

I'm in NYC and manage a Shopify site in the arts &amp; crafts niche founded in late 2017. Our name is very descriptive of our niche, and without giving too much away, is along the lines of ______ with ______. 

In mid 2018, we successfully filed to register the design mark, which features an illustration next to text with our name, ______ with _______. Unfortunately, I didn't consult an IP lawyer at the time and only registered the design mark with a literal element and not a word mark. 

In early 2018, up popped a competitor called ""Original _______ by _______."" For the longest time, I brushed it off and focused on creating and marketing a better business. But this competitor seems to have gained considerable sales traction in the last 2 years with a name that seems confusingly similar to ours. 

I've consulted an IP lawyer, who advised we simultaneously 1) start the process of registering the word mark for our brand name 2) send this person a C&amp;D along with a 3) draft complaint including ample evidence of actual confused customer emails. 

Shortly after these steps were taken, the competitor responded by briefly pausing the Google Ads they were running - ads featuring our brand name! - but then immediately ramping them back up with similar wording, ""_____ by ______."" He responded to the complaint by saying our design mark wouldn't make the case for us, that we should instead change our name to be less descriptive, and that we should worry he may countersue for false advertising and other claims. 

Right now, our Word Mark is pending. I understand this process takes a while. My lawyer at this point is advising that we move forward with the suit, as it doesn't seem likely this guy will stop willingly. However, I'm a bit apprehensive as I'm not sure how ironclad our case is without the Word Mark. 

According to back-of-the-envelope calculations based on order numbers on THEIR customer support emails we've received, they've done over $1m in sales. If the profit margin is anything similar to our business (10%), that's a considerable sum at stake. 

Over the past 2 years, this guy and I have established a lot of bad blood. We've exchanged DMCA takedown claims for various artwork featured on their site (ours valid, theirs not). They maliciously copied our top products, put the associated artwork on a random blog, claimed to be the initial artist, and issued DMCA claims. This guy has also sent us profanity-laden threats via anonymous email. 

It's also worth mentioning that while this guy markets his business to US customers, he's located in Canada. I'm located in NY, and my LLC is also registered in NY. 

So I'm staring down the barrel of a lawsuit here that the lawyer estimates at around $50k on the high end, all things considered. It's a difficult decision to make, but given the real and opportunity costs, it might be worth taking. What do you guys think?

We signed a year lease agreement when we first moved in around two years ago. The property has been listed since we moved in, but haven't heard anything from the property manager until the owner of the apartments had a realtor come by when a buyer is interested. We sign some paperwork for the bank about our monthly rent, but that's it. This was around four months ago. 


The sale falls through and we get a letter from the realtor about an increase in rent around two months ago, saying the increase date is May 1st. It's a little under 8%, but we haven't had any of the requested repairs even looked at since requested close to 5 months ago.

Only two out of the six tenants have signed the paperwork, and we haven't had any request from the property manager for the paperwork.

I get an email from the realtor that the amount paid this month doesn't reflect the increase, but nothing from the property manager. The other tenants have been ignoring the realtor and only communicating through the property manager, and only one that I know of paid the new rent. I'm looking for a new place for my roommate and I, but I'm curious if this is going to become a bigger issue.

7,"Do we have a case against our HOA's new trash &amp; recycle replacement resolution? [DE, USA]",1589067839,"As of last week, our HOA has stated that they're going to begin to replace our full size trash &amp; recycling cans, which are curently 96 gallon cans, with a much smaller 35 gallon can. Our current pickup schedules, which the Association has already said will go unchanged, allows for trash to be picked up once a week, and recycle to be picked up every other week. As of right now, with our current 96 gallon cans, trash is often overflowing weekly, and recycle filled to the brim every other week. Mind you, there are only two occupants in the unit I live in, including myself. Many of the units in my community (as the units differ in size) have 1-4 people, not including children. 

The association notes that this resolution was made as the rule was not being followed that notes trash receptacles should not be kept in ""common"" areas. Here are the two rules below that relate to trash receptacles:

\&gt; Section 5 - no storage pod, trash receptacle or other similar personality may be parked, situations, placed or maintained on any roadway, parking area, Common Element or Limited Common Element without the consent of the Association Council or the express written consent of the management agent (NOTE: this specific rule does not go on to mention what a common element or limited common element is defined as).

\&gt; Section 7, rule 1 - all garbage and other refuse shall be deposited in covered containers and in accordance with such instructions as may be furnished from time to time by Coucil. Each Unit Owner or Occupant shall take all reasonable steps to prevent his garbage and refuse from omitting odors sufficient reasonably to annoy any other Unit Owner or Occupant. 

The resolution that the Association has decided to go forth with is to provide each unit with a much smaller, 35 gallon trash can and recycle can (thing is seriously something out of a Barbie dream house set), and to have four trash cans placed under the stairs that lead to the upstairs unit on each end of the building. The recycle can is to be kept out of sight in the garage of each unit. Please note that the stairs leading up to these units are owned by the resident of that unit, and at the top of those stairs is a small private landing where the occupant can set up outdoor furniture to enjoy the ""outside"" of their unit. Furthermore, a proposed resolution of increasing pickup times was shot down by the Association as it was ""outside their budget."" 

The above two rules are the only that can be found within our ""Rules of Conduct"" for the community. Upon recepit of this resolution, the association was met with a vareity of complaints and negative comments. The Association sent an e-mail back out to its residents with many of these complaints &amp; negative comments being summarized which you can view [here.](https://imgur.com/GTh7RsS) The Association went on to say that this resolution is what was found to be most reasonable &amp; fair, and is continuing to move forward with their resolution. 

Throughout all of this, I have yet to speak with one community member or neighbor that has seen this resolution as something that was reasonable, or fair. Myself, as well as a few neighbors have come up with the following arguments that have all fell on deaf ears so far. 

* Recycling in my state, Delaware, is a requirement by law (as seen [here](https://delcode.delaware.gov/sessionlaws/ga145/chp275.shtml)) and trash companies must provide adequate containers so that families can recycle. 
   *  \&gt; ""Single stream curbside recycling collection services to all of their Delaware single-family residential customers, including delivery of a container for the purpose of storage and collection of recyclables that is adequately sized for the customers use such that recycling is encouraged and disposal of recyclables is discouraged; and the recyclables collection service shall be provided at a frequency of not less than once every other week.""
      * Important to note that the decreased size in recycling bins will discourage residents from recycling as they will not have the storage to do so in these cans. 
* The Association, and the fee that comes with it, is supposed to be set in place to provide residents with the appropriate means to live within this community. By providing us inadequate trash &amp; recycling receptacles, that will surely fill up quickly, leaving us with no place else to put our garbage &amp; recycle items, they are not providing us with the appropriate equipment to reside in this community (Reminder that the Association shot down a simpler resolution of increasing pickup times, which many community members recommended). 
* By placing all four trash cans directly under the stairs of the side units, there will be an inevitable odor that is created. This is unreasonably unfair to the occupants of these side units as the trash cans will be placed directly under the private landing for these units, as well as a window that sits above the stairs. Originally, this space was being used in order for unit owners to place their own cans. The Unit owner can control the odors emitting from their own cans, but will find it much more difficult when the cans are not owned by that unit. This resolution puts an unfair burden on the occupants of those specific units. This may result in an increase in neighbor disputes as well.

9,"How can I find out my court date (Chicago, IL)?",1589067639,"TL;DR - where the heck can I find/get notified of my court date?

I am in Chicago, IL staying at an Airbnb. Originally from NYC. I was staying at an Airbnb last February and was arrested for criminal trespass, misdemeanor. I had only been in Chicago for two weeks. 

I had taken Ambien and apparently was sleepwalking outside and went to an apartment that I thought was my Airbnb. It wasn’t. 

All I can recall from that moment is me standing outside his gate saying “You don’t understand. I’m staying at the Airbnb and I lost my key.”

He was standing in his doorway, no porch-light, with a handgun yelling at me. I called 911, the cops came, and I don’t know what happened next but I woke up in jail and was released with a court date for March 18th. 

I have no criminal record. Since I have no idea where this happened I didn’t leave my Airbnb for two weeks and then eventually moved to another Airbnb. I have no friends or family here. All I do is sit and wait. 

Due to Covid-19, my March 18th court date was postponed to May 1st (or at least that’s what I think it was based off of what little confusing information I got from the Cook County Clerk’s website). 

And now my court date is postponed again. I had called every number I could find to get an update. Nothing. They don’t have my correct address either so I haven’t received any notifications via mail. And nothing has been sent to my NYC address. 

I had a consultation with an attorney about two weeks ago and he was able to locate my next date, June 8th. Since all dates are being rescheduled and most appearances are now being done via Zoom I don’t even know where I am to go to do this. 

The Judge’s order on their website is difficult to read and parse and he mentions the branch courts are closed so everything is being done at the main Criminal Court House. 

My mother lives in Wisconsin and I had came to the area last year to take care of her. I am self-employed, currently have no income, and keep having to pay for an Airbnb (I can’t leave the state) just so I can be in Illinois. I’m on the verge of bankruptcy. If it keeps getting postponed I will be broke, homeless. I don’t know how to apply for a job now with a court case hanging over me. 

My questions - is there a way (which doesn’t involve me having to endure virtual capital punishment) for me to contact someone to get my new court date and is it possible to petition the Court for an emergency hearing? 

I realize the answer may be “call the Clerk’s office”. I have. Close to 100 times as well as any other number I could locate that I thought would be helpful. 

TL;DR - where the heck can I find/get notified of my court date in a timely manner. Thanks for any insight.",legaladvice,False,iambienwalrus,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggqf5n/how_can_i_find_out_my_court_date_chicago_il/

13,Report a Dog Breeder?,1589067224,"Hi, I am not positive if this is for this subreddit but can use some advice. My story goes:

Yesterday (may 8th) I had gone with my parents to pick up our German Shepherd puppy we have been waiting for. For weeks, we searched to find a reputable breeder and we settled on one we THOUGHT we could trust. Anyways, we picked up our puppy yesterday and took him home and almost immediately noticed something was off. He was very depressed, not very playful, very dehydrated, and sleeping a lot. We though it was fairly normal thinking, ""oh, new house so he's a bit nervous and puppies sleep a lot anyways"". Plus, the woman we got him from had them outside in the sun on pickup day (we live in a hot area) and figured thats why he was dehydrated (first thing we didn't like about her). The next morning (today may 9th), we took the puppy outside and saw that he had obvious worms in his stool (although we were assured by the breeder that he was dewormed 3 times already). We immediately contacted our vet who we then brought him to, and turn out he has worms and Parvo. 30 hours into owning our dog, he is a sick mess. Knowing how contagious it is, I can only assume that the rest of the liter she sold is sick as well. We contacted her after this, and she was not too helpful. She said she would take the dog back for a refund or we keep him and its on us. We can't in good conscience let the dog die in her possession, so we are taking him to the animal hospital in high hopes for a good recovery.

My account was set in USD, and Airbnb instead of doing a conversion from 730.92$CAD to 520.99$USD (because 1$CAD is 0.71$USD), they simply charged me 730.92$USD, which is equal to 1,024.57$CAD.

17,"Former employer publicly smeared my wife and I (on twitter) as terrorist sympathisers and Jew haters after sacking me for writing several pro-Palestine articles and essays. Is this libel, or his free speech? [UK/England and Wales]",1589066635,"My former employer, who is Jewish (this might be relevant) came across a series of essays and articles that I’ve written over the last 4 years regarding Palestine, Zionism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and found out about my work raising money for Palestinian children. Nowhere in my work do I incite or promote violence or say anything that can be reasonably construed as anti-Semitic, if anything I have repeatedly said that it is important not to equate Jews (the race) and Judaism (the religion) with Zionism, the political ideology.

Anyhow, I had walked away from my work to cook for my son and help my wife, who is struggling with a difficult pregnancy and only 2 weeks ago recovered from COVID-19, when I returned about an hour later I found that I could not access the server at my work, or the email account connected to my employer’s website, I went to my personal Yahoo account to write a note to a colleague, I am not particularly tech savvy and have struggled with this work-from-home concept so I thought that this was a problem of my own making, but then I saw an email from my boss that contained three sentences, telling me that my values are antithetical to that of the company and that my employment is terminated effective immediately, that I will receive my final cheque in the post by week’s end, I replied asking for clarification and only received links back to my own writing.

Later I made a Twitter post saying that I was looking for a new position, hoping that friends, colleagues or former schoolmates might lead me to new job. I did not mention my former employer at all. However I suppose that my activity was being monitored because soon after my former employer, on his personal Twitter tagged me in a post saying that I am, and I quite ‘a radicalised convert to Islam with terrorist sympathies and a rabid anti-Semite with backward ideals that have no place in British society or in a British workplace’ he then made a second tweet accusing my wife of being a ‘burka [sic] clad Jew hating Islamofascist ’ sharing a photo of my wife from her Facebook at a pro-Palestine event (where in fact she was not wearing a burqa), I replied to him and told him that he should not make such serious accusations, that attacking my wife is disgusting and that he should remove these posts immediately, he has neither responded nor removed them.

I don’t want my job back, I do not want to work for him and frankly I believe that someone should have the right to not employ someone who doesn’t share their values. My problem is the accusations against my wife and I, that we are terrorist sympathisers, Jew haters, radicals etc. as these could harm my career prospects and possibly cause trouble for my family and I in the future. Aside from my being a convert to Islam nothing he said about me had factual basis — is this libel? What can be done?

19,I am a victim of revenge pornography with substantial evidence of who did this to me. What comes next?,1589066462,"Hello all, 

I am looking for advice on how to move forward as I have been having an incredibly hard time getting in contact with a lawyer, let alone finding one in my area who deals with such matters. I am in Ohio but this started while I was living in Texas. The entirety of the situation is incredibly long so I will try to make this as easy to follow and short as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the late months of 2018, I began an **online** strictly sexual relationship with a man who I thought was in my local area. We never met in person and we spoke over the course of a few months in which we exchanged nude photographs. The relationship died down and we never spoke again. In February of 2019, my nude photographs were posted on a website that wasn't hosted in the U.S. so I was unable to send them a DMCA claim to get the pictures taken down. As it goes, they were up for too long and made their way through various sites like Reddit, Imgur, and 4chan (I was also doxxed on 4chan). While the person who was doing this to me was posting my nudes they also had a Kik account that they were using to circulate them even more. You could message this account, ask for my pictures and they would send them to you. When this all began happening I filed two police reports and contacted OSI and the legal team at the AFB the suspect was supposed to be stationed at. I also contacted a lawyer, who was incredibly insensitive to my case. It was a hard blow that no one seemed to care so I gave up trying to figure out who was doing this to me, counted my losses, became depressed, and did my best to move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was obviously devastating so a few months ago I started trying to figure out where this person was and why they did this. Through white pages premium, I was able to find the person (or so I thought) who was doing this to me. While doing this, I messaged the Kik account previously mentioned with a grabify link. I was lucky enough for them to be dumb enough to click the link in total 7 times without a VPN. I then had an IP address. I was able to find the general location of the IP and it was in South Carolina. 12 minutes away from my ***best friends*** (or so I thought) physical address. Their phone number area code also matches the location of the IP address. I have not confronted nor accused them of doing this to me in fear it would wreck my credibility somehow. I know their full name and address as well as their IP address. If you haven't figured it out yet, my very strong assumption is that my best friend at the time made a fake dating account near me, used fake photos and pursued a sexual relationship with me, and then posted my photos online. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I need help. In the state of Texas and Ohio, this is considered a crime. In the state of South Carolina, this is not a crime. Does this mean I do not have the ability to fight for a criminal case? Would this be strictly a civil case? If I pursue a civil case, is my evidence substantial enough to prove anything? If so, what exactly can be done in terms of a civil suit? Can literally **anything** be done at all? I appreciate any advice in advance, I have since reached out to several lawyers since obtaining the IP address but no one has contacted me back.

21,Did I have my dog stolen/How do I report a Rescue Agency? (VA),1589066185,"TL;DR and Questions at the bottom if the story is to long:

Recently my GF and I have been working with a dog rescue in VA to adopt a puppy. From the beginning, communication was tough, but they set us up to virtually meet two puppies that were being fostered by a couple. We wanted to adopt puppy A, and the fosters wanted to keep puppy B, which was great! However the fosters told us that communicating with the rescue had also been tough and that the person who ran it had been difficult to work with. 

Some time goes by and we both sign paperwork and pay our adoption fees and are told that we have officially adopted the respective puppies, but are told by the rescue that the puppies need to stay with the foster till they are 8 weeks, which will only be in a few days. 

The fosters take them both in to the vet, and to their surprise the rescue calls them and tells them that the vet is going to keep them and that they are undoing the adoption and that they can no longer have the pups. They are also then told that the puppies are only 5 and a half weeks old, which was a new development to all of us. The fosters call us and tell us what happened and are obviously devastated. 

I then call the rescue and ask whats going on, and they tell me that the fosters were unable to care for the pups (which isn't true, I spent the week facetiming them) and they also suggest I back out the adoption but didn't explain why. I then offer to take my pup, which we had technically adopted (as far as I know), as well as puppy B to foster them. This whole situation was weird and uncomfortable, but I felt these dogs needed a home. 

After having them for about 24 hours, the person that runs the agency then asks me if I can help cover both of their medical bills, past and future. I'm a little taken aback by this. I had previously offered to cover puppy As medical bills going forward, but not the past ones, and definitely not the new puppy who we were fostering. She then accused me of rescinding my charitable offer, which quickly spiraled downhill but I was able to calm down the situation. Just to be clear, to adopt each puppy we need to pay the agency 500$, and the agency then takes care of the puppies medical needs through their own vet for the first few months, i.e. vaccinations, deworming, etc. So asking for 1000$ and then also to also possibly cover several thousand in bills on top of that is unusual. 

The next day we need to go take puppy B back to the vet for health issues. The agency tells us to take both of them to their vet, which we go do. Once we get there the vet only wants to see puppy B, and they tell us to take puppy A home. About 5 min into the drive home the woman who runs the rescue calls us and quite literally yells at us telling us that puppy A needs to go back to the vet now, without any explanation to the urgency. We oblige, thinking its health related, but the vet isn't able to tell us anything. I then get a message from the agency that they will let us know when they are ready to pickup.

About 4 hours later I get a call from the woman that runs the agency. She tells me that she is going to refund the adoption fee that I paid. Initially I think this is because we had made it clear that we felt that the communication was bad with them and that she had literally just yelled at us on the phone for no reason. I then ask if shes trying to undo the adoption, and she tells me that she is and that they are keeping both dogs. When asked why, she tells me that she doesn't think we are a good fit, and that because I wouldn't pay their medical bills. I respond saying that even though they are covered by the adoption fee, that I would still be happy to help out, but she says she doesn't believe me. 

The conversation then gets worse when I ask how she can nullify an adoption, and she says she never actually approved it in the first place (even though I have the agreement, even though its digital). I then ask if theres someone else I can work with and she tells me that she is in charge of the whole agency. I also go on to ask who certifies her to run an agency, and she refuses to tell me. This then causes her to go off on a rant about how she would take me to court and how she had tons of money. And she literally calls us ""ungrateful pieces of sh\*\*"" and says that shes going to ""track \[me\] down and ruin my f\*\*\*ing life"". I then hang up.

We are obviously torn up about this. We only had the dogs for about 3 days but caring for 6 week old puppies is extremely time consuming and we got pretty attached.  

TL;DR:

I adopted a dog from a rescue and was fostering his brother. When I took them to the vet the person that ran the agency called me and told me they were undoing the adoption and couldn't provide a reason that broke the contract. The agency also did the exact same thing to the previous fosters as well. The woman that runs the agency is also pretty damn mean and explicitly threatened us.

29,My employer wants me to resign so he can have his PPP forgiven (FL) Advice?,1589065558,"I work for a small retail business in one of the counties that reopened in Phase 1 recently. Before the official order, my boss (owner) was planning on opening early with precautions (appointment only, 1 employee and 1 customer at a time, etc). 

Before when things were more uncertain, my boss flip flopped on how we would be paid, first he said he would pay us, then told us to go on unemployment and back and forth until finally he said he was approved for the PPP and would continue paying us as usual. By this point, I had already filed for unemployment but made no claims to it. 

I came in one day to assist with some things (one which was primarily going into several customers' homes) and despite promises of safety procedures, we did not follow any verbal promises and my work environment felt very unsafe. My boss later asked me to write a SOP for safety which we would then implement and I laid out basic guidelines following CDC and OSHA guidelines. 

Later, our county was announced open and when asked what structures we were implementing, my boss (through text) said that he had no plan. My boss then called me to say that he could not reasonably implement ANY safety standards, and that he would understand if that makes me uncomfortable, and I should resign officially so that he could get the loan forgiven but he would, whenever I felt safe to do so, welcome me back. 

My concern is about how this impacts me financially and how this impacts my ability to claim unemployment. I would be resigning because of unsafe work conditions, which is a reason for unemployment benefits, but hard to prove without writing. Through rejecting his offer to be ""rehired/go back to work"" I may be ineligible for unemployment. However, after the 8 weeks that PPP covers, which is coming up soon for us I believe as we closed on March 21st, one is able to put employees on furlough or lay them off and the employee would then be eligible for unemployment. Is it possible to remain on furlough while other employees are back to work? Are any of these avenues I can pursue?

30,"[WI, USA] Vehicle broken into while at dealership for service work. Dealership saying “sorry it’s not our problem”.",1589065493,"I brought my vehicle to the dealership I purchased it from, for routine maintenance. During the appointment (Wednesday), the service advisor noticed a recall was open that needed special order parts, so I was given a loaner and told it would take two days for the parts, and that I’d receive a phone call when they were in and another phone call when it was completed. 

I received the “parts are in” phone call on Friday.  On Saturday morning, I received another phone call. I expected it to be the “cars all done” call. 

Instead, it was the new car sales manager, saying that a few vehicles had been broken into the previous night and I needed to come in. 

Turns out, about 5-6 vehicles on the lot - all new (less than 3 years old) and all of them customer owned (I’m told it’s because our vehicles have “a person drives this car regularly” stuff inside them) - were broken into. Most have the rear window smashed out, including mine, and they took my stereo system, subs, whatever change I had in the cup holder, and my sunglasses. 

The dealership is telling me to kick rocks, basically. They’re offering me a 5% discount if I repair my vehicle through their body shop, but the service form I signed apparently absolves them of all liability. 

Police did come. They were there when I got there and remained when I left. I do have a copy of the police report. The dealership has cameras posted along the back and side of the lot (where the customer cars, employees, and loaner vehicle parking spots are), but they said “oh they haven’t worked for years”. There are no lights in the back/side lot, but there are in the front (where the new cars go). 

Is there anything I can do to not have to pay for this? If I hadn’t had the safety recall (airbag harness), it would’ve been in my garage and not been busted into. The dealership should have to help with SOMEthing, right? Or is it really that one signature that says they can work on my car make it so I’m out this repair money?

Note: the recall was completed Friday afternoon, but the RO shows that it was finalized at 5:32pm and the dealership closes at 6pm on Fridays.

I’m not gonna get into the nitty gritty but I have found myself in a situation where I never thought I’d be, girlfriend and I of 6 years are done and we have a 2 year old son.

* She has been a stay at home mom for many years, no income, and a recent case of mental health issues regarding suicide.

* I work a lot of hours to keep us a float, and have a temper during fights (nothing physically) and tend to raise my voice, she and her mother now have called me mentally abusive and an absent/inattentive parent. None of these is true, so I am here to figure out the smartest next steps for my sons long term benefit.

- She says she has video recording of me being loud and mean to her. a) I have never done anything other than be loud, nothing “abusive” other than maybe saying she is acting “crazy”, “insane”, something of that nature which albeit not nice to say in the heat of things, but as I said... I’m being called mentally abusive. And b) I was never informed of these recordings until today with the blow up, so god knows how long she’s been hiding these. I looked it up and Illinois is a 2 party state and since I was not told about these recordings... they are illegal correct?  Like I said, nothing in them that is “bad” I’m just trying to keep her from messing things up by trying to bring illegal tapes to court.

- She is now asking me to stay with my parents. I don’t quite know whether or not this is a good idea. I rent this home and I feel as if we have lost a lot of trust during this ordeal... but now she is attempting to guilt me into leaving my saying it’s best for our son... I want to do right by him first and foremost... but I do not want to end up a statistic in the list of dad’s who got screwed over in custody hearings.

- Should I speak to a lawyer yet or wait? I’m thinking yes, and have always heard it’s the best choice to do so immediately but I figured I’d at least ask this question and see what kind of guidance I could get.

The divorce was pushed for more by me than it was her. There is no history of any domestic issues between us, no sleeping around or anything like that(that I know of anyway). How can one just get a summons asking for access to your information like that it makes no sense to me.

42,Can I sue my workplace for failing to reestablish my health insurance after mistakenly dropping me? Health situation MAY be life-threatening.,1589064441,"I'm a contractual employee. Two months ago, I noticed that HR had the wrong end date for my contract. I corrected them, and they supposedly fixed the mistake in their computer. Despite this, they  proceeded to terminate my employment on that date and I lost my health insurance as a result.   


I didn't have to stop working. They were able to fix my employment issue immediately, but it's been over a month and I've yet to get my insurance back. My prescription medication, which is related to my recent emergency hospitalization, is about to run out, and I still have very important appointments (that I've had to reschedule) that I really can't miss. Since losing my insurance, my anxiety has been so extreme that I'm having physical symptoms and regular breakdowns. As I'm typing this, I'm in severe enough pain to possibly warrant another hospital visit but I can't and won't because I can't afford the hospitalization on my own. There seems to have been little to no progress made. 

This is not the first time that I've had my benefits dropped. I can go into greater detail upon request, but I want to know if the current situation alone is enough to sue. The previous instance was more convoluted and there were too many moving parts to know immediately who was at fault.

43,Neighbors threatening to sue over lost house sale because of dogs,1589064427,"I have been living with my fiancée in his parent's home since March - his parents live in another state. I normally live on my own (personal preference until we're married), but my job was affected by COVID-19, and I have been unable to secure another apartment without income, so my future in-laws let me stay at their home. 

I have two small dogs, and occasionally I would let them out in the screened-in pool area (lanai for those of you familiar with Florida homes) when we ran short errands. I did not know that my dogs barked while I was gone - I came back one day to find a strong, green, acidic substance all over the hallway where my dogs stayed. Looking at the spray marks, it looks like it was sprayed from the neighbors. I asked them the following day about it where they complained that the dogs were constantly barking but denied spraying or doing anything to the dogs. No harm no foul - I no longer let my dogs out, only for when I took them to the bathroom. 

Fast forward to 2 months time now. My fiancee's father receives an email from the neighbor who admitted that he had shot two firecrackers at my dogs in an attempt to get them to stop barking - thankfully he missed. He also said that he planned on multiple occasions to shoot them with his BB gun or rifle, stating that he would if they tried to challenge them. I let my dogs roam the lawn without a leash and there is not a fence between the lawns, so occasionally they will wander to their plants, but they have never strayed more than 5 feet from our property as we were always supervising them. 

The neighbors were in the middle of doing a private house sale but the buyer changed their mind because of my barking dogs. They are now threatening to sue over lost compensation and realtor fees. They are leaders in the HOA and have given us an ultimatum: either we get rid of the dogs, or they will sue and also draw up fines for when the garbage bin was left out too long (bins are supposed to taken in immediately after trash day, but my fiancée sometimes forgets and has left them out for 2 days. They also complained the property was basically a ""slum house"" - the grass was brown for a bit, and we had trouble getting the pesticide business and water sprinkler business to come out. 

I was finally offered a job so I will be moving out by the end of month, but I am scared what legal recourse they could take and what protection we have. They even filed a police report for the time my dogs strayed onto their lawn. I'm also wondering if I have any power since they admitted to shooting firecrackers at them. I don't have photos of the residue they left unfortunately. I feel that they are being extremely unreasonable and I wish they would have talked with us first if they felt this strongly, and we took steps to resolve the barking when they addressed it with us. They even complained they could still hear the dogs barking when we left them in the house, though that would mean they would hear the barking from 2 sets of walls and 50 feet between the homes. We are taking the dogs out on leashes to the bathroom now.

47,"Legality of out of jurisdiction traffic stop? (State Statute no. 629.40) [MN, USA]",1589064225,"Hi all. I was pulled over recently on a MN State Highway for swerving out of my lane (""crossing the white fog line,"" according to the complaint). During this traffic stop, the officer searched my car because she smelled marijuana, found some, and arrested me accordingly. I'm fairly sure I didn't swerve over the fog line, as the fog line on that particular stretch of highway was painted directly over the rumble strip and I did not feel my car touch the rumble strip.

I was released the following Monday, made peace with my situation despite my gripe with the reason for the traffic stop, and hired a lawyer. Due to the pandemic, I couldn't talk to my lawyer in person, so I recounted the events that led up to the stop via email. For context, I'll give a boiled down version that directly relates to my question:

I was driving back to my small college town from home, and I was extremely tired as it was late at night. I was on a state highway, and had to pass through several small towns on the way. Since leaving the last small town I'd passed through (let's call it Little Town on the Prairie), the highway was straight as an arrow for several miles and I'd kind of zoned out and gone on ""autopilot"" due to my tiredness and focus on music I was listening to. I had cruise control set to the speed limit, so I was basically just holding the wheel steady. It should be noted that after a while on this straight stretch, I noticed a car behind me but thought nothing of it. The highway started curving to the right which caught me off guard, so I jerked the wheel. The red and blues came on behind me so I pulled over immediately. The officer who pulled me over was a municipal officer with Little Town on the Prairie's police department.

 While recounting this experience in my email, I was trying to be as detailed and thorough as possible, so I wanted to make sure I gave him the exact location of the stop to the best of my memory. Since I remembered that I swerved because I encountered a curve in the highway, I decided to use Google Maps to identify the location I was pulled over. It was quite easy to find, as it turned out there was only one spot of the highway between Little Town on the Prairie and the next small town that curved rightward (or curved at all, for that matter). The rest of the highway in between the two was straight.

I noticed that this bit of highway was pretty far away from Little Town on the Prairie, and remembered how I was pulled over by a member of their police force, not by an officer of the State Patrol or a county sheriff/sheriff's deputy. I used the ""measure distance"" feature of Google Maps, and found that the location was a little over 8 miles down the highway from the city limits of Little Town on the Prairie and some 1,300 feet from the city limits of the next town over. This put a damper on the peace I had made with the situation and raised some questions, so I visited the website of the Office of the Revisor of Statutes and looked up the relevant regulations related to jurisdiction.

On the Revisor's website, I found Statute 629.40, relating to jurisdictional restrictions of officers and cases which allow them to exercise powers of arrest out of their jurisdiction. 

Subd. 2 of that statute is as follows: `Subd. 2: Out of jurisdiction arrests: In any case in which a person licensed under section` [`626.84, subdivision 1`](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/626.84#stat.626.84.1)`, may by law, either with or without a warrant, arrest a person for a criminal offense committed within the jurisdiction of the officer, and the person to be arrested escapes from or is out of the county, statutory or home rule charter city, or town, the officer may pursue and apprehend the person to be arrested anywhere in this state.` 

Subd. 3 is as follows: `Subd. 3.Authority for arrests outside jurisdiction: When a person licensed under section` [`626.84, subdivision 1`](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/626.84#stat.626.84.1)`, in obedience to the order of a court or in the course and scope of employment or in fresh pursuit as provided in subdivision 2, is outside of the person's jurisdiction, the person is serving in the regular line of duty as fully as though the service was within the person's jurisdiction.`

I did not commit a traffic violation within the borders of Little Town on the Prairie, nor did I flee from the Little Town on the Prairie city limits in an attempt to evade that town's police force. As I said, the traffic violation I committed happened well outside the city limits of Little Town on the Prairie, and I pulled over immediately when I saw the lights get flicked on. 

Now, Subd. 3 allows an officer to extra-jurisdictionally pull someone over as part of their ""course and scope of employment."" This is a quite a vague statement. So, I researched exactly what that phrase meant. There wasn't much in terms of a concrete definition, but I found a retired MN district court judge, Alan F. Pendleton (10th judicial district), had written a handbook titled ""Minnesota Handbook on Motor Vehicles: Stops, Warrantless Searches, and Seizures."" 

Within this handbook, which is intended to ""provide judges, attorneys and law enforcement officers with a comprehensive reference guide to the laws governing motor vehicle stops and the seven (7) exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement under which warrantless searches of motor vehicles may be justified,"" Mr. Pendleton provided insight on what the ""course and scope of employment"" was. He gave an example of a case which a MN Court of Appeals ruled that an officer's out-of-jurisdiction arrest was justified. In that case, the officer noticed a vehicle driving erratically within his municipality and followed it outside his jurisdiction, where he ""soon noticed"" it continued to drive erratically. He pulled it over and arrested the occupant. Other than that specific case, Mr. Pendleton wrote 'it was unclear how far MN appellate courts would go in defining the course and scope of employment.'

I will restate that I did not commit a traffic violation within the borders of Little Town on the Prairie, nor was I driving erratically at any point during the night, much less while I was within their city limits. So, it seems the Little Town on the Prairie officer had followed me 'just because' for several miles outside of her jurisdiction, almost into the next town, until the point I swerved over the fog line. There wasn't any behavior on the roadway until that point on my behalf that pointed to the fact I might have been under the influence or otherwise a danger to myself or other motorists. 

Thus, it seems like the Little Town on the Prairie officer was out of her ""course and scope of employment"" when she pulled me over that far outside of her town, considering she had no reason to follow me that far outside of her municipality. Municipal police do not patrol state highways. What are your thoughts on this? Is this something I should bring up to my lawyer so he can argue it in court?

A letter containing your personally identifiable information may have been inadvertently included in an envelope addressed to another person. Out of an abundance of caution and concern for the integrity of your personal and confidential information, this e-mail is to advise you of the issue and to inform you that the New York State Department of Labor will be providing you with free credit monitoring for one year.""

MY QUESTION IS: How can we warn other homeowners that this woman may take advantage of them as well? Can I publicly post her photo, name, birthday (I have a copy of her driver's license)? Is that legal??

(Yes, we've talked to a few lawyers: they initially said to settle out of court because there is no way to tell how long this moratorium would last.

She has listed her ""friend"" on her will as the daughter of a her life long friend. This is someone I don't know at all, and haven't seen in nearly 30 years.

She believes the lawyer put this clause in there in case I am unable to act, but unless I'm reading it wrong, it essentially means she has as much power over my mothers assets as I do. I don't know if this person is nefarious or would try and dick me around (it would be a pretty large estate if and when the time comes).

90,Solar panel company installed panels on my roof but never completed the installation and has now gone MIA,1589059024,"Last December I entered into a contract with a company to have them install solar panels. They installed the panels shortly afterwards, but the county wouldn't approve it due to a technicality, so the company agreed to come back at a later date. (This was a few weeks before covid-19.) Since then, the company has completely ignored all of my messages trying to schedule an appointment to fix the panels and I have no idea where we are on status. 

I would like to get panels installed ASAP whether it be with them or another company. Unfortunately the contract says that I have the right to cancel the contract if they haven't installed the panels by this upcoming December. On the other hand, I have their panels on my roof.

I guess my questions are: (1) Do I really have to wait until December before I can cancel the contract? Does it matter that they haven't responded to me for almost three months? (2) In the meantime, can I have another company remove their panels and install their own? (3) Does the fact that I literally have their panels on my roof give me any sort of leverage?

91,Bought house with existing fence encroachment based on realtor's professional advice -- now I'm losing land to adverse possession,1589058659,"I bought a house back in September 2018 as a 26 year old first-time-home-buyer. The morning before closing, my realtor ordered a survey of the property.
Minutes before closing in a law office, my realtor told me the survey had been done and it showed the house I was buying had a fence encroaching on my southern neighbor's property by a few inches (for a length of 15 ft), and then my eastern neighbor had a fence built that was actually on my property by up to 6 ft (for a length of 100ft).
She told me as she showed me the survey ""it's not a big deal. Encroachments happen all the time and I recommend that you keep the survey in a safe place and maybe talk to your eastern neighbor about his fence being on your property.""

Based on her response to the survey and ""it not being a big deal"", I continued through with closing and I own the house now.

Fast forward to March 2020 when I finally saw my neighbor for the first time. I introduced myself and told him he's on my property. 
Things went downhill from there. He's claiming adverse possession of the land and I'll likely lose if I were to go to court. He would've satisfied the length of time to claim the land through adverse possession before I even bought my house.

What legal options do I have?
My title insurance won't cover me because there's an Exception in the policy that makes it not cover adverse possession (which makes me think why the hell do we get title insurance anyway?)

96,Owner isn't paying drivers for time in company vehicle in transit to job site (MA),1589058322,"My boyfriend has a friend who owns a small trucking company (like dump truck/heavy construction kind of trucking). Owner was telling my boyfriend that he had a small disagreement with his new driver because the driver put more hours on his timesheet for the week than the owner had billable hours from the jobs that were worked. The driver put down the hours from when he left the shop in the company vehicle to when he returned to the shop in the company vehicle at the end of the day. Owner said that he only pays his drivers for their time from when they arrive on site to when they leave the site, because he only bills the customers for the time they're on site. 

My boyfriend and I both think this is, at the very least, unfair because in order to perform the work on each job site, the drivers have to go to the shop and get the company vehicle and then drive to the site. It seems like this should be paid by the owner as part of his overhead cost of owning the business, or in other words that the rate he's charging the customer should include enough to pay his drivers travel time. It seems to me like since part of the driver's job is to get the company vehicle to the job site (rather than it being on site ready and waiting for them), that this is working time rather than personal commuting time.

However, obviously my feelings don't matter here. So is there any actual legal or labor regulations on this where the owner has to pay the driver for the time spent in the company vehicle between the office location and the job site?  Or is it simply ok that as long as the owner and the employee agree that these are the terms of employment (that were clearly not made clear at the time of hire), that it's totally allowable?

98,Work dispute... need advice on employment law! (UK),1589058247,"Obligatory: on mobile so sorry for format. Also apologies as it’s a bit of a long story but is all relevant.

Last year in September I was suffering with mental health disorders and sleep disorders, ongoing for 6 months prior to that, which I was under investigation for. My doctor recommended I speak to occupational health to see if I could have any help at work as I was really struggling.

I requested a referral to occupational health by email to the head of HR, Maddie, to see what could be done to help me at work. I was told that in the first instance I would need to discuss my symptoms with her in more detail, so I had a meeting with Maddie and my line manager, where I explained my ongoing health difficulties. 

I had been suffering since February 2019. In the meeting I became quite emotional, which I admit was a bit unprofessional, but I’d been suffering so much I couldn’t help it. She barely responded at all, except to ask me if I felt well enough to be at work. I told her I did not, I went home. My GP then signed me off work. I was signed off until January 2020. 

In October 2019 the company I work for requested a report from my GP on my current state of health. I was contractually obligated to consent to this. The report was received by the company in January 2020. The report had everything I had told work about my disorders, confirming the authenticity of everything I had told them. It is my opinion they thought I was lying and were trying to catch me out. Anyway. At the end of the report my doctor had advised he didn’t know what would help me at work and to seek the relevant occupational health advice. 

On my return in January 2020 I requested a seat change to help aid my return-to-work, since a huge trigger for my mood disorder is loud and conflicting noises. I suffer panic attacks in loud environments. I was placed directly in the middle of the office, surrounded by noise (before my absence I was on the outskirts of the office, but my seat was changed during my absence) I asked to move towards the outskirts again so I could focus and not feel overwhelmed. I was told I had to wait until March 2020 to move seats. I asked if it couldn’t be brought forward, as it was directly impacting me. This question was brushed off. I was signed off again in February 2020 for 2 weeks from persisting mental health disorders. 

By the end of March, my seat in the office still hadn’t changed despite almost every other colleague having had seat changes! I was shocked since I had expressed difficulty in this seat and was a perfectly reasonable adjustment to request, yet it had been completely ignored. I had been promised a seat move in March.

I had another meeting with Maddie in Feb 2020 when I returned to work, where I expressed that I didn’t understand why an occupational health referral still hadn’t been made when I requested one in September AND my doctor report recommended one. I asked why they even requested the report if the advice on it was not going to be followed. (I would like to note the medical report included details of my medical history that was NOT relevant to my absence, such as my weight and previous conditions. Maddie commented on my weight during this meeting, which I found inappropriate). I expressed frustration I hadn’t had a seat change. I just couldn’t understand why nothing was being done to help even though I didn’t feel that moving seat was a huge ask. 

We have been working from home due to covid since the beginning of April and since then I had 2 days off, for the same thing - mental disorders continuing. I then got an email last week threatening formal action against me for my absence, however before that would take place, I was finally being granted an occupational health referral. 

I am challenging the threat formal action. My argument is  that if I had been given one when I requested it 8 months ago and when my doctor recommended one, I may well have had adjustments by now, that meant my absence would’ve improved. I emailed my line manager expressing I felt my situation was being mishandled. 


I got a rude email back from Maddie directly, saying the company has done everything they can to help me, and that if I don’t agree with her then I should file a grievance. I replied to her explaining I didn’t feel I had been supported adequately and outlined the reasons why. I included I felt it was inappropriate to only offer the occupational health referral alongside a threat of formal action.

I had my occupational health meeting last week and they let me know my conditions are covered by the equality act since they have severe impact on my day-to-day activities and have persisted for over a year.

Does my employer  have grounds to formally discipline me? I have worked for this company for over 2 years and was an exemplary employee before falling ill. Since then it feels like I am just being managed out. I could understand formal action being considered if occupational health had made recommendations and THEN I continued to be absent, but I feel until they have sought specialist advice on how to make adjustments, or listen to any of my concerns, then they can’t formally discipline me for absence. I have involved my union but thus far haven’t heard anything back.

99,We Just Found Out My Husband Is Married To Someone Else,1589058217,"Last night I (40F) was searching our State’s Judiciary Case search because I wanted to see if a judgement had been recorded as paid off so my husband and I can apply for a mortgage. To my dismay I discovered that my husband (48M) had an entry in which he, the plaintiff, filed for divorce from his son’s mother (30F) in August of last year. Important note we got married in October of last year. Needless to say I was beside myself and immediately confronted my husband. He told me he had no idea and immediately tried calling his son’s mother. My husband sent her a screenshot of the on line divorce entry and told her to call him immediately. 

She called back this morning very upset and crying saying that when her grandmother died over a year ago she needed to be married in order to receive the inheritance. She then stole his social security card and birth certificate, applied for a marriage license, convinced one of her friends to become ordained online who then signed the marriage certificate and filed it with the court, thus making them legally married. My husband had no knowledge of this, nor did I, or else we would have delayed our own wedding until theirs was annulled. When she received the inheritance she filed for divorce with my husband as the plaintiff. A hearing date was set to which he didn’t show up to of course so the case remains open and they are still legally married. 

Of note, this woman has a history of spending addiction, being evicted on several occasions, and was sent to inpatient rehab and counseling to address this issue. Obviously she has not overcome her demons. 

She has told my husband she will contact a lawyer and make arrangements to get it annulled ASAP but of course this can’t happen for quite some time due to the courts being closed for the foreseeable future. 

My question is, are my husband and I not married? Are we breaking the law? Can I be cited for insurance fraud due to placing my husband on my insurance and him using those services?

1,Question about Neighbors Throwing Away Our Cats' Food,1589058110,"Hi,

I am posting here and on a few other forums hoping to get some advice. I don't have a lot of experience with posting, so please let me know if I am not following specific protocol!

My parents are the elders of a church, and their church rents the church building from a landlord who also used to be a pastor back when the church building hosted a church that belonged to him. I know that's kind of confusing, but basically, he retired from his church and started renting out the building. My parents' church has been renting this building for about 15 years to have their services throughout the week. 

The building has two units, the church and one residential unit where other tenants live, which have separate entrances. For the last five years, my mom has had 3 pet cats at the building. A stray gave birth to these kittens at the church, and my mom named and kept them for the last five years. They live outdoors at the church, and my mom goes to the church almost every day to feed them. She loves these cats. She leaves the food and water underneath the stairwell to the entrance to the church so rain doesn't get in.

A new family (whose dad is a pastor at another church owned by the same landlord) moved into the residential unit recently, while my parents' church is still there. My mom noticed that for the past two weeks, the cats have disappeared and that the food seems like it's being cleaned out by someone every time she goes. She thought the new tenants were doing that, so she put up a sign saying something like, ""Please do not throw out the cats' food. Thank you."" She went back today to find out that the food was thrown out again.

So she knocked on the door of the residential unit and inquired, and a woman from the house (probably the other church's pastor's daughter) said yes, she was cleaning out the cats' food since they are allergic to cats. She also said the fur from underneath the stairwell is coming into their basement, which is not true since fur can't come in through the window, but I digress. When my mom asked her again to confirm if she was throwing the food out, the lady lied and denied it!

My mom is really sad about this since the poor cats must be starving, and she's not sure what rights we have as owners of the cats. The main issue is that the other tenants have been throwing away our pets' food for weeks on end without asking us and without our consent, when this is supposed to be a shared space on the property. As church tenants, we have a right to use the space, too. We've been here 15 years and for the last 5 years, our cats have never caused a problem. Is what the other tenants are doing illegal? Or is it within their legal rights?

4,Vet Won't Give Dog's Records,1589057448,"Los Angeles, CA, USA: My father bought a health insurance plan for the dog as a gift for us. Before he purchased the plan, I'd gone to a vet and pointed out a lump on his neck which the vet told me to keep an eye on. All was well until I realized that was before I got the dog's plan and the lump now excludes him from cancer coverage as it's considered a preexisting condition. Since it was only one lump (on a now 10 year old lumpy dog) I realize if I get the medical records and have that one particular lump tested, he may have coverage for cancer if the test comes back negative. I've been fighting with the vet to get his medical records so I can prove to the insurance it was just that one particular lump (which the insurance claims to have no specific information as to its location) that needs to be tested. Apparently, they can't give pet owners their own pet's medical records? They only fax it to the new vet or hospital. When I explained the new vet doesn't have access to a fax machine they basically told me they couldn't do anything. I continued to hound them (pun intended) about getting his records. They finally gave me summary notes about the dog's visits but nothing with information about the lump or where it was located and the date it was found. Which is the only reason I'm asking for the records. So now my kind father is paying for expensive dog insurance that won't cover the dog for cancer because this vet refuses to give me what I need. I asked them to send the records to the insurance and they won't even do that. I've done research on pet medical record confidentiality and it says the owner is supposed to be given the medical records when requested. I plan on reporting them to the veterinary medical board but I feel there has to be something more I can do, though I'm not sure what. Any suggestions?

TL;DR:

Lumpy older dog has expensive pet insurance that won't cover cancer because one lump was preexisting. I'm trying to get that particular lump tested so I can prove it's not cancer but the insurance has no record of the location of the lump. I asked the vet for medical records for the location and date found which they won't give to me, or the insurance company for that matter. I will report them to the veterinary medical board as I see CA says I should have timely access to my pet's records but there has to be something more I can do? If the dog dies of cancer in the future cause they won't give me the records... the thought infuriates me, the dog doesn't deserve that.

For some context, I'm a Male 15 year old, and my mom died a few days ago for a reason I'm not aware of yet. My aunt has a history of taking very valuable (monetarily wise) things from people that recently died (she took an extreme amount of things from my grandfather, she even ripped up the newly installed carpet in his house). With the death of my mom, she was found to have taken a safe, and a Tupperware full of money. She has been acting extremely suspicious, like bringing her boyfriend and child to my mom's house when it was just supposed to be my father, sister, her, and me. The fact that she brought her boyfriend has me a little bit suspicious because the safe is large enough to have to be carried by 2 people. My aunt is the only person with a key to my mom's house, for some unknown reason.

I'm not a law whiz, but I think this would be enough to be able to call the cops based on circumstantial evidence, and get some justice on my mother's and grandfather's behalf.

11,Can I take action against this surgeon? VA,1589056676,"I am new to this and would just like some advice on this situation. When my wisdom teeth started to grow and cause me pain, my dentist referred me to an oral surgeon. The first red flag occurred during my consultation with him. I spent the majority of the appointment making it clear to him that I am SEVERELY allergic to penicillin. That day he wrote me a prescription because I was set to have my wisdom teeth removed 4 days later. When my mom and I went to have the prescription filled, we asked the pharmacist if the prescription had any relation to penicillin. The pharmacist told us that it was penicillin. I was pissed but my mother told me that we had to go through with it because this was the only place nearby that would take my insurance. On the day of the surgery when he went to insert the IV needle, he didn’t wipe my arm with alcohol. Then he couldn’t get the needle in so he tried again and again. It got to the point where he had stabbed me twelve times as I was begging him to stop as well as the nurses telling him to stop. When I came out of surgery my mother asked why I looked like a human pin cushion. He claimed
I was being difficult which is untrue. As soon as I woke up, I knew something was wrong. I was still on the anesthetic but I could feel this awful pain in the top right side of my mouth. I am on video saying that it hurts. He told me to shut up. When I went back to the dentist it turns out that he left the top right hole opened and the skin that grew back didn’t cover the hole, but it covered my back molars which is quite painful to deal with. I was told that it will probably require surgery to fix his screw up. I’d rather die than go back to that madman. What can I do?

16,Father's custody rights question,1589056176,"There is so much to our situation, I'm just going to keep it simple and answer questions as i go.

Children: 2 girls, currently aged 4 and 6 years old.


Current court order from february 2020, states:

There is no significant change in circumstance therefore father's application to be the parent of primary residence is hereby denied. Parenting time is not being amended, the parties are free to amend the parenting time as they see fit. Father is currently residing in bucks county. Pennsylvania. Mother currently resides in Gloucester county, nj. Children go to school in gloucester county. We have an out of state father who is the PAR and a instate mother who lives in Gloucester county, nj.

Previous court order, included; father has parebting time from 6pm friday until 6pm sunday, 3 weekends per month. Curbside pickup at mother's residence. 


Mother was allowing me to pickup our children fridays by 9pm, as my ride gets done work at 7pm. It is approximately an hour drive from my residence to hers. 

Mother stopped allowing 9pm pickup time, once i asked the court to change the primary residence to my residence for our children. My concerns were:

- Mother previously stated several times throughout 2019, that she was moving to maryland with a guy she met, she did not follow through.

- Mother stated she was moving to south Carolina several times throughout the year, with another guy she met, she did not follow through.

- My children had told me that they weren't living at ""aunt jen's"", they stated that they were loving in a hotel. Jen was a friend that mother moved in with when we split up in december of 2018.

- My children had told me that there were several different people bathing them during different times throughout the year.

- My children had told me that they stayed overnight with mother, at various times throughout the year, at the homes of men that mother had met.

- in July of 2019, mother had told me that she was going to commit suicide and that i was to keep the children, that she wouldn't put up a fight to let me keep them.

- i had stated to the court, that i was concerned with mom's mental health, due to her suicide attempts and also i have on record where she wanted to kill our children.

- i had stated to the court my concerns of issues that may arise from moving in with a guy that mom barely knows.

- My children were telling me that they were living in a Wawa parking lot, mother confirmed that she stayed at a Wawa parking lot overnight at least once, because of somebody she was staying overnight with to go to a funeral, had an issue with his 'ex' breaking in during the night and a physical fight had happened.

- DYFS was called when mother was staying at a Wawa parking lot, not by me, by a mandated reporter. 

- mother told me she was moving in with a guy she met, to Gloucester county. She made the move with this man on december 17, 2019. I filed on december 20, 2019.

- i asked the court to ask mom, how any of this was beneficial to our children, to be moved around, change schools in the middle of the school year, how it was beneficial to our youngest, of whom had a placement in a school and now does not where she had moved. I was told by the judge that, mom has the right to move 20 times or more throughout the year and it was none of my business as to why. My testimony was deemed credible and so was mom's, as she had stated that nobody bathes our children, except for her.

I had brought up all of these concerns with DYFS as well and nothing was done about it, as DYFS had gotten involved for something soon after the court hearing on February 4, 2020. I cannot currently recall exactly why they were involved at that time, no documentation was provided to me.

- on april 23, 2020, mother had called me saying that she had the cops called on the guy she moved in with, as, she had found pictures on the guy's phone of our daughter's crotch.

- DYFS was again involved because of this, i again stated to them about all of my concerns that i had brought up in court and how i explained it all to DYFS back in february, 2020 and nothing ever happened from it.

- Mother has told me that the family of the guy she was living with wants to evict her and keeps playing little games, like, shutting utilities off.

- DYFS had asked what my plans are for taking my children, i had said i already tried and nobody wanted to take any of my concerns into consideration. DYFS kept telling me that i have rights and with joint legal and physical custody, i can legally have my children.

- I asked mom if i were to exercise my rights as a father, would there be an issue. Mom had said that i can visit with my children, but i am not allowed to take them back to my residence.

- mom has not allowed visitation, since the COVID breakout has occured. I have been telling her that i will take them until everything dies down with COVID, as there are less cases here in Pennsylvania than in new jersey. She keeps telling me ""no"" but I'm allowed to visit with them, only if she is allowed to partake.

- mom keeps telling me that she doesn't want my children around anyone that I'm involved with, i have been telling her the same thing, since she started saying it. 

- since everything has happened with the guy she's living with, she has had guy friends stay over ""for protection"" in case the guy's family starts anything further, or in case the guy himself tries to come by.

- mom feels that if she has the children, the family is not allowed to evict her under any circumstances, COVID laws aside.

21,Purchased a used vehicle and had a return period. I used this period and the dealership attempted to fight me and claimed I committed fraud.,1589055165,"So I purchased a vehicle, the next day I was verbally told that our pay could potentially be going back down sooner than expected(I have no way of proving this its purely what I heard and I don't even remember who I was talking to about it.) and the insurance rates were way higher than I had been quoted for previously.

 I am currently being paid more due to the pandemic but as things open sooner than expected we may be going back to normal and as such my pay would be as well. I did not feel comfortable with the new payment as it would have put a huge financial burden on me earlier than expected so I utilized the return period that I had.

They attempted to say I could not return it as I had been given special financing that voided the return guarantee, no where in the papers that I signed did it say this. I specifically signed a paper saying I DID have the ability to return it within a certain number of days/certain mileage used. His claim was that when I changed my down payment he printed off the old one for the return and that I actually could not return it despite the fact I never signed a paper saying I couldn't. He stopped arguing once I told him that I am going based off the paperwork I signed and I was audibly frustrated with him on the phone.

He was asking why this was going to be a problem for me financially and that I committed fraud by using my adjusted pay knowing it could go back down, all I did was provide what I was asked which was when I was applying for the credit for the vehicle I was asked to provide my last two paystubs, which I did but they were at the adjusted rate and I did not think twice about it. I did not intentionally mislead him or the lenders I just provided what I was asked and my situation changed rapidly. He talked to his boss and they agreed to unwind the deal and I signed a paper named ""unwind sheet"" and that they were going to charge me for the miles and two days I had it and that my down payment would be refunded in 4-6 weeks. Which is fine. My concerns are could they come after me still? I had to turn over all the paperwork I had(per the agreement I signed during initially buying the vehicle) so I have no copies of what I signed now, I also was not given a copy of my unwind sheet despite my asking. I opened a customer support ticket in regards to this so that I have a paper trail of some sort and I also texted the manager in an attempt to have it emailed to me.

I'm just worried they may come after me or the financial institution might for ""fraud"" that I don't think I committed and I feel like I have no protection when I have no papers or anything besides a witness that was with me during the initial purchase and return.",legaladvice,False,Arsenal85,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggmq03/purchased_a_used_vehicle_and_had_a_return_period/
22,I [21F] want to report my ex [22M] for distributing child pornography. He got wind of this and said he'd report me for logging into his email/social media account without his consent. This all happened 4 years ago—does he have a case?,1589055164,"(2016) When I was 17, I went on a post-prom getaway with my boyfriend at the time, who was 18. While we were here, he took a sexual video of me while I was drunk. Fast forward to that summer, he shared that video of me to another adult without my consent. I expressed anger at the situation but I didn't know what to do because this was my first relationship. This all happened in NJ, where he was living at the time. 

(2017) Fast forward a couple months later, I finally broke things off with him after he became more and more abusive. We were both 18 at that point. I had told him in my breakup speech that he was abusive and that I could report the stuff he put me through but I wasn't going to. This got him paranoid and he started telling all of his friends that I was making false rape accusations against him to ruin his life and get attention. (I had never accused him of rape, just abuse in general, and had specified I would not be going to the police but that I very well could so he had better stop harassing me. I think he just told his friends that in order to get sympathy from them and make me out to be the bad guy.) 

At first I didn't really know what was going on but people were telling me I was a horrible person, my ex exposed what a snake I was, women who make false rape accusations belong in jail, I needed to get help, etc. I was completely bewildered and my ex would not tell me what kind of rumors he was spreading about me. However, he had always used my computer throughout our relationship to log in to his email and his social media accounts, so all of his passwords were auto-saved on my computer. I decided to log in to his email and Facebook messenger to see what he was saying about me, and I was horrified at what I found. 

I quickly told him I knew what he was doing, and that if he was gonna keep up with this, I was actually going to report him for the distribution of child pornography and other abusive things he did to me so that everyone would find out what actual accusations I was making against him. He responded with screenshots of his social media/email login activity which showed someone logging into my account from my town and said ""Good luck with that, I'll report you for hacking into my accounts which is a felony, and you also broke a FERPA law because that's my school email. Thought you wanted to go to law school?"" I got scared and I had a lot of other things going on at the time so I dropped it. All of this happened in PA, where I lived with my parents and he went to college. 

Now it's been a few years since all of this happened and I am in a much better place. I have recently been talking to my therapist about all of this and have been thinking maybe I do want to pursue legal action. I have very well-documented evidence. I know NJ's statute of limitations for child abuse (which is what I assume what he did would fall under) is until the victim is 55. However, I am not so sure about the statute of limitations in PA is for me logging into his accounts, and whether or not he has a case. 

I really do not want anything on my record because my ex is right that I am planning on going to law school, and I have worked too hard for a good GPA/LSAT to give up now. Do you think my ex could still report me for logging into his accounts back in 2017?

34,**SAVING MY BABY BROTHER**,1589054410,"Help Saving My Brother

Hi everyone,
I’m trying to help my brother stay away from abusive and neglectful parents. My grandmother currently has custody of him, she was also my guardian for the majority of my life growing up. Our mother is fighting for him back. We are all very scared the court might let her take him from us. She is not mentally stable, is usually homeless, surrounds herself with toxic and abusive people, is emotionally always on edge, and has been a drug addict on and off for the majority of her life. My mama is still beautiful and can hide it at times in her face with makeup. Most people can tell she has had a hard life though. I just don’t know what can happen in this situation, she’s a danger to herself and others. I love her very much, but the best place for my brother is at my grandmother's until she gets to her best self. My mom's motive for getting my brother back is to fill her void. At times when she has had him, she immediately can’t handle the constant care of another human being. This leads my brother to be in the arms of whoever is closest to her. My baby brother deserves more than that. He is doing amazing at my grandmother's house, he is growing and learning every day. He has his own room, homeschooling, cousins to play with, healthy food, a huge loving family. My family is even willing to help my mom, once she takes the first steps to better herself. My father who is not the father of the baby and an abusive toxic person is now around her. CPS took me away from both of my parents. My mother has retreated back to him because he enables her in exchange for her company. My father is trying to help my mom get my baby brother, in order to make my brother his own. I do feel he is trying to get back at me because I never felt safe in his presence and ultimately did not want anything to do with him because of his abusive pattern. My father is smart, and my mother is vulnerable to someone like him. I’m scared for her too. I’ve written decelerations, and letters to the court. My mother just filed an ex-parte, filled with many lies. I’m going to have to go back point by point and refute every single lie she has put. I plan on doing an opposition to her termination of guardianship papers. **DOES  ANYONE HAVE ANY  ADVICE  OR FREE LEGAL AID THEY CAN DIRECT ME TO? I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO A LAWYER LAST WEEK BUT THEY HAVE NOT GOTTEN BACK TO ME BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL BACKED UP.** I’m trying to save my brother from a lonely and sad childhood. I feel like he will have it worse than I did because my mom is the worst she has ever been. I love my mom, I think about her every day and pray she will finally see the truth and understand. I want her to understand and see why we are doing this. No one wants to hurt her, but we have to do what’s right for my beautiful baby boy. He lights up the world, he has already gone through so much. If my mother gets him I don’t know where that path will lead. I know he will face many more obstacles than he should.

It took a while to get, but the total award was $18,000 and my dad is getting back his original $2,000 in a number of installments while the attorney is keeping the rest.

I’m now getting involved with my father’s affairs because of things like this, and although he’s happy to be receiving the original $2,000 back it seems like he was taken advantage of.

It’s pretty lax as far as HOAs go, so I haven’t been really concerned. This is the first time I’ve lived somewhere that has one. We pay $500 a month to maintain the gravel road, central water system, street lights and random maintenance. I’m no expert on what those cost so I went back through the Declaration of Easements, Covenants and Restrictions to find an itemized list.  What I found said this “Each member shall pay two maintenance fees of $10 each per month to the association. One such $10 fee is to be used for paying cost associated with the driveway, and shall be due beginning the month after purchase of a lot from the developer. One such $10 fee is to be used for maintaining the central water system and shall be due beginning the month after a lot is tapped onto the system.” To me, that says I’m only supposed to be paying $20 a month which comes to $240 a year, not $500. Now, maybe things need to be adjusted over the years and I get that, but our HOA officer said that she “needs to be paid from that amount too”. I was under the impression she was a volunteer and was not supposed to be paid for this. She got frustrated when I asked her for an itemized list and told me it was in the Declaration.

It was month to month, had to pay first+last+security deposit and it was relatively lax with a sparse rental agreement and payments in cash. It was a very casual rental situation because the landlord was cool and the place was a work-in-progress situation.  
  
After I gave her notice (which she acknowledged), cleaned, and moved out, I waited almost a month and didn't hear anything from her. I asked for her to send my deposit via text because that was how we communicated. No reply for a couple weeks, so I asked again and nothing. In comes my letter of demand asking for my deposit by 5/20 and she called me asking for a copy of the rental agreement because I assume she lost it. She is forgetful and a bit on the old side, so I understand, but I don't know if I should.  
  
I already told her I would send her a copy of the rental agreement like a fool because she's this frail character and I felt like I couldn't say no. I was also not sure if somewhere, somehow there is a little tidbit in law that says I would have to provide a copy if asked, but I feel like that is not the case and there would be no benefit to sending a copy.  
  
I don't want to be an asshole about anything because I feel like we've always been on relatively good terms, but I'm conflicted about this whole situation. Is there any reason for me to send her a copy of the rental agreement that *she* lost? For that matter, is there any reason I *shouldn't*?

My question is regarding a will contest. I have no experience with legal matters so I  have been shocked by what I have seen so far.  The contest is based on pure fiction and demonstrably false allegations. Also the grounds for contesting this will are all 4 reasons you can contest a will ( undue influence, forgery, improper execution AND lack of testamentary capacity).

I don't understand why someone would do this.  To my mind it makes the contest look more like a fishing expedition and less of a sincere effort to right a perceived wrong.

Also why would the party contesting the will file a book of bald faced lies?  

I asked my attorney if all this dishonesty and  viciousness  was the normal way to contest a will?   My usually calm,  prim and proper attorney surprised me by blurting out "" Hell no this is not normal, but she's a vindictive bitch!""

If my attorney can see that then I'm guessing the judge will see that too.  So how does making it obvious that one is a greedy, vindictive liar who will say anything to get the will thrown out possibly sway a judge to rule in one's favor.  I don't understand.  What am I missing here?

When I was 18 years old, my fathers girlfriend sold me her car. I paid $1000 for it and took over the monthly payments as well as the insurance. The car was never put in my name and she told me that once I finished paying it off, she would turn the title over to me. In October of 2019, the car started breaking down. I took it to a mechanic and they did a full inspection of the car. The whole thing was falling apart essentially. I still have the document that lists everything that was wrong with it. I spent October through January paying 1600 to 1800 dollars worth of repairs on it. Neither my dad or his girlfriend offered to help with any of it. I made my payments, fixed the car and paid insurance on it without any help. Despite all of the repairs I did on it, the car still had issues. 

In February I came home from work one night and my dad told me that my insurance had went up. He would routinely claim that my insurance was going up, but I would later find out from my sister that he was just trying to get extra money out of me. I confronted them and they told me that I could stop using the car if I got my own and paid my own insurance without any assistance. They also told me they would give me all of the money back that I had spent since they sold me the car with issues on purpose. I found a dealership that would accept me and decently priced insurance as well.

However... And this is where the story starts.

My roommate and I were both just recently released from prison and are in transitional housing. We were each released about a month apart, but JUST before the quarantine, and suffice it to say, we haven't hand much in the way of job seeking opportunities. My roommate is 30 and had been in prison for 13 years, meaning he was 17 when he was locked up. Having gotten out when we did, we were each depending on the Economic Impact Relief payments to get things we needed to take care of ourselves. Having no previous obligations against myself, I got mine without trouble. When his came in the mail, it was as a notification that 100% of his relief had been taken for child support.

As I stated before, you make a baby, you need to take care of it, but, aside from food stamps, that is his ONLY source of income and at the moment I'm pretty much supporting his non-food needs at the moment, which I can't afford either. He's not a family member, he's not my lover and had no interest in me anyway,, and we hadn't even know each other before being put into community placement together.

Is there any recourse to be taken aside from simply appealing the decision?

Hey guys, sorry if I break any social rules I’m new to reddit (just got told to post this here from the r/motorcycles guys) I need help with my situation, some guy tried robbing my bike a bit ago at night while it was parked but he got caught, not before he dropped my bike, dragged it and damaged some parts of it. I tried to claim it on my insurance but me being dumb, didn’t buy vandalism/theft, the police say I can claim restitution but I have no idea how that works and since the I don’t have an income right now because of the virus, I can’t really pay a mechanic to look over it. So what I’m asking is what I can do now, what should I check for and how do I get the most amount of money out of this scumbag, and maybe any stories of something similar happening to you all. From what I can see, the part that houses the key hole is cracked when he tried jamming a screw driver in there, both fairings are broken with the left one cracked the most, left rear set is broken clean off, it looks like the chain is touching the swing arm but I don’t know how normal that is, the left handle bar is bent and other parts of the bike are scuffed. I haven’t turned the bike on since the battery is dead and I am a bit scared to since I’m not mechanically enlightened enough to tell is anything’s wrong.

Hi Reddit. My grandfather recently had a heart bypass surgery. He was in the icu for about a month before being transferred to a rehabilitation hospital. Due to COVID-19, we have been unable to see him other than facetime calls. Calls from the rehabilitation hospital have been extremely brief, and not informative. Our first sign of negligence is the rehabilitation hospital removed my grandfather’s tracheostomy tube without consent. My grandfather has dementia and my grandmother is his decision maker. She and his other doctors have made it clear that she is the one who needs to give consent, not my grandfather, because he is confused and doesn’t know what he is consenting to. We were not made aware of the tube removal until two days after it was removed. The final straw for us was two days ago, my grandfather had been trying to get out of bed (which he cannot do, due to his weakness) and we were not informed. The next day he had fallen three feet from his bed. I am concerned this is negligent behaviour, as no precautions were put in place to prevent the fall from happening.

Michigan doesn't have any pet laws per se, but I wasn't notified of the change in advance and this seems like a change to our current agreement. Do I even have any room argue this?

Important Details:

* Has an ID but no drivers license. DPS shut down as soon as she was about to go take the test.
* The vehicle she used has full coverage but only under her partners name.
* She has auto insurance on her on vehicle.

A couple of weeks ago she had to use her partner's car to get to work due to being an essential employee. On her way back home she was doing a left turn when a truck hit the rear passenger door of the car she was driving. The intersection has traffic lights and 5 lanes (next to a highway). The left most lane (lane 1) is to do a U turn over the highway. The other two left lanes (lane 2 and 3) are two turn left only. The right most lane is to go straight or turn right (lane 5) and the other one is to go straight (lane 4). The truck was on lane 2 and she was on lane 3. As she was turning the truck struck her vehicle. It appeared that the man driving the truck was attempting to leave but two other cars blocked his truck from leaving so he had no choice but to get out. My friend was able to get the contact information for those two witnesses. The police were called and showed up but they did not make a police report because they don't do them unless someone is hurt. The man in the truck did not have any ID or insurance or at least that's what he said at first but then was able to provide an ID through a picture on his phone that was sent to him (if I remember correctly). My friend obtained the number of his insurance but when she called they told her that he was not on the policy and it was someone else's policy on that truck. After some back and forth with the insurance company they told her that the person on the policy was not answering so they can deny her claim. She called her partner's insurance and they aren't taking any initiative at all. I believe she has some of the guy's info. What can she about this matter?

We found an apartment that we like but my girlfriend has a dog who is an emotional support animal under direction from her doctor. The apartment that we are interested in (and have already paid to apply to) has a no pets policy, but the property manager told me that support animals are welcome as long as there is a note from a doctor, we would just need to sign a lease amendment. We were approved for the apartment and before paying the first month’s rent, I asked to see the support animal lease amendment. The amendment was all pretty straight forward (no excessive barking, no aggression, etc. etc.), but one of the points states: “ the comfort/service animal will not be allowed to use any part of the building or property for depositing waste. Should this occur accidentally, tenant will immediately pick up the waste”.   
I found this strange since this essentially makes it impossible to have a dog if you cannot let it go to the bathroom. At our current apartment we walk our dog on the grass and immediately pick up and waste and dispose of it. We have never had any unhappy neighbors or property manager and I feel like we are good dog owners. So i asked him to clarify this point and told him that we currently immediately pick up and dispose of waste. he said: “correct, you cannot take the dog out on the property of the apartment complex, but there are properties down the street that you could take it to”. To me this seems like a convenient way to “technically allow support animals, but make it so inconvenient that no one would actually rent there”. Is this legal? Would it be reasonable for me to request that he changes the amendment to say: any waste will immediately be picked up and disposed of”? We really like the apartment, it is a perfect location and price, but this would make it extremely difficult to rent there. What are my options?

89,Wedding venue vendor changing contract for rescheduling wedding date due to COVID-19,1589050291,"Sorry for the novel, I want to be sure to provide all the details.

**Some background:** We were originally scheduled to get married on June 27, 2020. We had all our vendors lined up, contracts signed, and deposits paid. Then COVID hit.

We waited it out a bit but eventually decided we needed to postpone the wedding. As we reached out to all our vendors, all of them were very understanding and accommodating. Well, all but one.

The venue was incredibly hesitant to reschedule our wedding despite the circumstances and the date only being 65 days out at the time. At first they said they were following the CDC guidelines of large group gatherings and only offering free rescheduling to weddings scheduled through May 15. If we wanted to reschedule in the meantime, they expected us to pay a $1000 administrative fee. This was nowhere to be found in the contract we signed, and upon calling that out they responded with ""well we lose money when events reschedule"" like they were the only ones affected.

Our wedding coordinator was absolutely shocked and appalled by this and said that of the 11 other weddings she was organizing at the time not a single other couple was experiencing such pushback from any vendor.

I pushed harder and imagine I wasn't the only one outraged and eventually the venue backed down and said they were now waiving the administrative fee (you know, the one they created out of thin air). I said great and asked for whatever paperwork they would like signed to document the change in event date.

We aligned all our other vendors and found a date that worked for everyone (an entire year out: June 26, 2021). All other vendors sent over paperwork for me to sign that just had the event date amended. All other vendors were satisfied with just that -- previous deposit remained intact and no changes to the contract other than the date.

**Current day:** I received the updated contract from our venue. It's not just a new event date, instead there are entirely new clauses in this version:

* Due to the current situation, [Venue] is allowing User to change event date. A full venue payment is due upon signing new contract by User. (Original contract stated outstanding balance must be paid 60 days prior to the scheduled event date.)
* Full venue payment is non-refundable. (Original contract provided x% refund of the initial deposit depending on how far out the event was cancelled.)
* [Venue] is waiving any changing and administration fees. (Again, there never was a change or administrative fee called out in the original contract.)
* Any User hosting an event during the pandemic will be granted unlimited date changes (after this one, limited to Sunday through
Friday dates only), until Local or National Government announces the pandemic has concluded. (IMO this is ridiculous to exclude Saturdays.)

I have not signed this new contract nor do I intend to pay the venue the remaining balance due when the event is still 13 months away.

So my questions are:

* Is the venue legally allowed to change the contract so drastically in their favor despite just wanting to change the date?
* The original contract had absolutely no language about rescheduling, only cancelling. The cancellation language was as follows: ""A 50% deposit, credited towards the total fee, is required with the signed Facilities Agreement within seven (7) days of receiving the Agreement. This deposit is refundable minus a $500.00 administration fee if the event is canceled over 6 months before the event date, 50% refundable if canceled between 6-3 months before the event date, and is not refundable if canceled 3 months or less before the event date. The balance of the facilities fee is due and payable by the User sixty (60) days prior to the event and is non refundable. The event is subject to cancellation if this payment is not received on time."" Given that's what we signed, is the venue able to introduce new clauses that are only beneficial to their party at this time?
* What's the best approach for us to take? I've already pushed back hard about the $1000 administrative fee and we still very much want to have our wedding at this venue.

Any and all advice and guidance is appreciated. Thank you in advance! And oh, it probably doesn't matter but FWIW the venue is 501(c)4 Non-Profit Social Organization.",legaladvice,False,___Art_Vandelay___,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggl6zx/wedding_venue_vendor_changing_contract_for/

What's not fine with me is that they make the noise until midnight or later (I have to be up at 4:30am for work), and they let their toddler RUN all day through the apartment. All we hear all day from the kid is BOOM BOOM BOOM while it stomp runs through their house. I've already talked to them once about it and they said, ""oh sorry. We will keep it down."" But they haven't kept it down. 
I've called the office and talked to them about the noise, and they've spoken with the neighbors about it. But the noise is still ridiculous. 
What can I do at this point? 

As an afterthought I'd like to be clear on something. I understand that kids run and play. I get it. But it's unacceptable for them to let their kid run and stomp as often as they do. It's about 70% of the day that there is running and stomping.",legaladvice,False,Camerondotkent,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggl509/noisy_neighbors_ca/

8,“Asked to resign” from my job - coworkers insist i have a case,1589048452,"Okay, here are the facts. 

January 2020, i became homeless. The fourth key at my work offered to take me in. He lived with another associate at the time, who he referred to the job. I agreed. We didnt think to update my home address as the company didn’t send any mail to us, w2’s and all that are online. 

About a month ago, we were exposed to someone with the corona virus. He had since been promoted to ASM. He went to visit his friend, who was diagnosed a week later. We were both put into quarantine for two weeks. Our store manager wrote a report to corporate explaining the circumstances of our exposure. 

Two weeks later, corporate contacted our store manager and notified us that it was against policy for managers to live with associates. I promptly moved in with another, non manager coworker to rectify the situation. 

The day before yesterday, I was asked to either resign or transfer to another store. ASM could not be transferred since no other locations had openings, i could not be transferred for the same reason, AND i had no transportation and the coworker i was staying with lived 1/2 a mile from the store, which was why i was able to stay when i moved in with her in the first place. On top of all this, our stores are extremely low on hours, the woman who came down to ask me to resign admitted that our store was the only one in the entire district that had any associates because of the virus, so i couldnt transfer even if i had the means. 

I was a very good worker. Never written up, a model employee through and through. My store manager, ASM, and previous ASM’s and managers in training all fought for me, and have urged me to fight this. 

I have aspergers and this job was the first place where i didnt feel stupid. I am obsessed with animals and know very little about anything but the care of the animals in the store. I was knowledgable about every animal in the store, fantastic at customer service, and always happy to help people. All this is not just my opinion, but was told to me by managers during performance reviews. Several of my coworkers and even managers at other stores who have worked with me have suggested that their sudden change in plans were due to them somehow finding out about the Aspergers. They believe corporate didn’t up and fire me because they found out through the grapevine that i had autism and knew i couldn’t sue if i resigned. While this is very suspicious, I’m not sure if thats their motive and if i can even prove it is. They’re claiming I’m being asked to resign because any of my coworkers can claim favoritism if they're disciplined for something that i also did. 

The problem there is that i know of at least 2 cases of similar situations (not counting the fact that the ASM’s other ex roommate faces no disciplinary action that ive heard of), including one including a store manager and an district manager being married that went on for 20 years, including a period where the company paid for the down payment on their house so they can move to a new district. The DM was fired in the end, but that was after 20+ years of this, as opposed to 4 months. The relationship between the ASM and me was completely platonic, and he was (and is) in a relationship with someone else who was living in the apartment at the time. 

The problem is that we have no way to prove there was any wrong doing in regards to my aspergers or unfair treatment. As of yet I haven’t resigned, and I’m being urged to refuse resignation and have them terminate me. I’m confused why so many people are adamant that i should seek legal assistance.

I'm now the defendant and have tried legal aid, etc. To make this short I have been trying to get help since day after being served. I can only leave messages and am still waiting for response and list of attorneys from legal aide. The attorney who represented me for accident does not answer my messages or emails for copies of documents etc. (You name it , I have been in contact and told no they will not be getting involved.) So I need to atleast file my response on time with the court. I'd really like more time since walk ins will be allowed in my area in PBC Florida on May 11th.
I understand I need to admit, deny or state I have no knowledge to each of the 12 items. 

Example #5 : At all times pertinent to this action, A.S. Subrogor , the owner of vehicle that is subject of this  action, and the occupants of said vehicle, covered by a policy of insurance issued by Plaintiff Geico General Insurance Company providing Uninsured/ Underinsured Motorist benefits pursuant to terms and conditions of said policy.

Yeah I know the guy had Geico and I had Progressive. I dont know what his policy means. There is exhibit A attached of 47 pages of policy which I cant understand. How do I respond correctly to say party admit partly deny? Or what would be correct terms to use?

For example #9 states :

On or about date mentioned plaintiff was suffered serious bodily injury as a result of defendant's negligence operating mother vehicle.

I want to say I deny this. That the plaintiff ran red light while speeding resulting in severe bodily injury to myself and daughter. Is this too much info.? Should I just say deny and move on to next? 

From what I do understand I'm supposed to attach evidence supporting my claim. I'm trying to get copies of independent 911 call my attorney used to get me a settlement but like I said, he will not respond to my email or phone messages for this request even though he said it would be mailed out weeks ago. I feel like there are some documents that I could add but I dont physical have them to use. 
Example # 10 :

As a direct and proximate result of (me) 's negligence, and pursuant to terms and conditions of the aforementioned policy of insurance, Plantiff was forced to pay the sum of $100,000.00 in uninsured/ underinsured motorist benefits for personal injuries suffered by Mr. A.S.
I want to deny. But how do I say correctly that plaintiff hit me and his insurance paid me. ( my insurance was basic and he could have received small amount but my insurance claims adjuster told me they didn't pay him a penny because they found him at fault.) Is less said the better in statement responses? Should I just say no knowledge? 
What I would like to say in whole is I deny this because plaintiff ran a red light speeding hit us totaled car and I got some money. Now plaintiff and his insurance are coming after us for that money. But I dont know how to properly word this.

Ex #12 : plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent required of it to for bringing this action against defendants, and no facts exist that would constitute either set off to this debt or a counterclaim against plaintiff. 

How should I know? I'm not in legal field. Can I say I have no Knowledge? Or do I say I deny ?

14,"N11 Form versus 'a release form'. Is there any issue with not signing the latter, after my lease has ended? Ontario.",1589047557,"Kind of a complicated scenario but I will try to keep it brief. 

I have moved out of a rental unit at the end of April. I signed an N11 Form, but did not perform a move out inspection with the landlord. The lease says that:

*After the Tenant gives a Notice of Termination of Tenancy to the Landlord, the Tenant shall arrange with the Landlord to complete an Outgoing Inspection Report, which shall be signed by the Landlord and the Tenant. If the Tenant fails to arrange for the completion, or to complete, the Outgoing Inspection Report with the Landlord, then the Tenant is deemed to accept the content of the Outgoing Inspection Report completed solely by the Landlord.*

No move out inspection was performed by the landlord until into May, when a new lease had begun. The scenario around why it was not performed in April with my one roommate that remained in the unit until April 30th is unclear, but I'm not too sure it matters (correct me if I'm wrong).

The landlord is now claiming that I **must** perform this move out inspection now, and sign a release form; saying if I do so they will minimize fees directed towards me. My argument is that the unit is now in a new lease, and that any damages/items in the house cannot be tied to me as my lease ended at the end of April and there is new tenants that can instead be held accountable. 

For more context, when I moved out, I emptied my room and removed all possessions (have a video of my empty room as well). One of my old roommates, who's lease terminated when mine did, is now subletting from the new tenants that took over for May and moved a few items in my vacant room. There is currently a dispute between the landlord and this roommate, that I want no part of.  However, the landlord keeps tying me back to the issue by bringing up this release form not being completed. 

My question is, do I have to sign this document now that my lease is over? Can an outgoing inspection report even be performed after my lease is up and a new one has begun? I keep trying to tell the landlord this, that I am no longer a resident, but the release form not being signed and the fees I will have to pay because of it keeps coming up. I'm wondering if my thinking is wrong, because the lease says '...t*he Tenant is deemed to accept the content of the Outgoing Inspection Report completed solely by the Landlord.'* Is this applicable, even into May?

We would like to give the option and allow those who want to work to return now, but allow the others to stay on unemployment.  Texas has no job search requirements at the moment, but if we are open, and they theoretically have the option to add themselves to our schedule, does that automatically disqualify them from benefits based on ""refusing to accept a suitable job""?  We have absolutely no reason or plans to report them, as again, they are independent contractors and we have no control over when they offer us time anyway.

21,"My job will not let me return because I am still positive for COVID, however they are not furloughing and I have already used all of my pandemic sick pay. I’m now not getting paid at all. What can I do?",1589047035,"So back on the 21st of March is when I had my first symptoms of coronavirus. I got over the worst of the illness and now I am well over a month from day one of my symptoms and still have trouble breathing and have a cough. So last week I finally got the go ahead to be tested, and I just got my test results today and they were positive. The provider I spoke to on the phone said there was really no telling when I’ll stop shedding the virus but that I have to continue to quarantine. 

The problem is is that I am now completely without income. My job gave us an allotment of two weeks of pandemic sick pay to use and then an additional borrowed pto of 100 hours that I would essentially be in debt to them and if I decide to leave the company before I’ve worked enough hours (15~ months) to come back from -100hrs to 0 hrs of PTO, I will owe them the amount of money that was given to me. Which now would total around $2300. Which is not something I have lying around. This is also a really well paying job and the schedule works perfectly so I would like to keep it. 

I’ve reached out to my local HR rep and they’ve basically told me I’m SOL. I have bills and have literally no way of paying them now. I’m also not sure what will happen with my health insurance if I’m not coming in to work. 

Is there anything I can do about this? Would I qualify for unemployment? My manager and operations manager called me the other day and told me very sternly that I was not furloughed so I could not apply for unemployment. But that I was also not allowed to come back to work. 

I have no idea what to do here! I recently moved to this area so all the savings I’d had were blown through on the move. And then I wasn’t working long enough at this job to build up more than a couple hundred of savings before I came down with COVID. 

I have no money to fall back on except the $800 in my account right now. I have absolutely no idea what to do. I’m fucked financially until I test negative. This is in Indiana.

TL;DR: I am still testing positive for COVID after a month and a half and my job will not let me return to work, but they are also not offering me any more options as far as sick leave or anything goes. I am now totally without income until I test negative for the virus, which there’s no telling when that’ll be.

Here's the situation: Over ebay Kleinanzeigen (which is like Craigslist in Germany) I made a post about a specific Graphicscard I was looking for, and someone messaged me over Whatsapp because I attached my phone number and the end of the post. He said he had the Card i was looking for and showed me pictures of it which were way too good to be done by an amateur. So I googled a bit and found them on a Tech Forum Post. I asked him if he made the pictures himself he responded he didn't make them  and sent me a picture of  the Graphicscard which was nowhere to be found online. He lowballed the offer I made him for the card which was 1700€ and said he would give it to me for 1600€. I got kinda suspicious but still rolled with it. Now if you pay over Paypal as Seller and Buyer you have insurance incase you get scammed. He did not have Paypal. So since i really wanted the Graphicscard I used a Purchase Contract which I found online. (Linked below) He sent me a picture of himself with his Personal ID (i don't know if that is him but we had a voice call where the voice could definetly match) and some pictures of the ID itself so I could copy the information on the contract. I filled out everything, signed it, scanned it and sent it to him. He printed it out, signed it, scanned it and sent it back. So now I was assured i would be safe and sent the money to the bankaccount he gave me, which was also from the city his ID stated he was located in. So everything matched. He also took me through the whole process by sending me pictures of him printing the contract etc. . So a bit of times passes and i ask him if everythinng went well and if the monney reached his bankaccount yet. Be said he doesn't have online banking so he went to a bank by foor and said he would take the money from the bankaccount if its there and then send the Package with the card right after. So then I didn't hear anything back from him andI asked if everything went well. No response. So I went to bed(really worried) and in the morning he had blocked me on Whatsapp. I tried calling his number on 2 SIMS but it doesnt even ring. I also contacted my Bank but they said its too late to cancel it. Im not entirely sure but it seems like a scam to me. He sent me screenshots of his email account, too it looked really legit. There were emails from Forums and Stuff like that.

My sister passed away in a tragic accident on the first of February this year. I contacted Robinhood through my personal account about a week after to report the death; the representative was sympathetic and helpful at first and provided me with all the information they need in order to close everything out and have the funds transferred to her family. Through my own research, I found that we don’t have to go through probate court since the estate did not exceed $166,250 (we live in California), so after 40 days I gathered a notarized small estate affidavit, and Robinhood’s required affidavit of domicile from her husband, and submitted it through a secure portal they sent me online along with a color scan of her death certificate. 
I received a confirmation that they received it and that it appeared complete. But then nothing...
I followed up weekly at first, and they let me know that they are “waiting on their legal department to review.” Then the communication stopped. It’s been 3 weeks of no communication despite my consistent follow-up emails. They have no number so I can’t speak to anyone. 
My sister had 2 other accounts in other financial institutions (Chase and a local credit union) both were able to close out and distribute the funds on the same day the paperwork was turned in. 
Her Robinhood account had a little over $55,000 so it’s very upsetting that it has taken this long and I can’t even get an update. All her positions were closed out so that money is all in cash, it should not be taking this long.

32,Apartment building switched my storage unit to a smaller one without telling me,1589046213,"I recently purchased a unit in a newly built apartment building. I was the first purchaser at the time and a few months after purchase, management told me that each unit now has storage units in the basement of the building that they had just built and divided. Someone from management showed me the storage units and how each unit was labelled with the apartment numbers (basically a door sign) and showed me my unit and told me I could use this from now on. By chance, the one that had my apartment number on it happened to be one of the larger storage units, which was nice. I didn’t have much to store other than a few empty boxes from moving in. Management told me I could use my own padlock to keep things safe, but I figured I didn’t need a lock at the time because it was just empty boxes (mistake on my part in hindsight).

Fast forward a few months (to a few weeks ago). By this time some of the other units were sold. I go down to store some more valuable items and have a padlock in hand to lock my valuables. What was my storage unit is now locked (not by me). All of the door signs that labelled/assigned the units to each apartment are gone, and my unit now has a piece of scrap paper taped to it with the number of a different apartment. The only remaining open storage units are very small (about half the size of my original unit). I call management and they say they don’t know what happened and why signs were removed from all the units. I call the selling realtor and he goes back and forth with the builder and he gives me different answers until eventually he tells me that the labels were originally mislabeled and the larger units were intended to be assigned to the more expensive apartments. I have my doubts as my purchase contract and the other a paperwork I received didn’t even mention storage units as they were nonexistent at the time of purchase (and I’m assuming the same goes for the contracts of the other units). Also, I wasn’t even notified of this change.

My parents met this ex-Hollywood couple 4 years ago, two years ago we went through a family tragedy and suddenly my parents bought an adjacent 40 acres property next to their and started dumping their savings into it to build a yoga retreat for this couple they met. They also moved the couple into a rental on the property. My mom and the man became really close and she started telling me things like ""he doesn't want any business or rental contracts in place, because our relationship is built on trust"", ""he thinks we should go high-end with our property remodel because this retreat is going to attract the 1%s"" (their property is in a very low income desert area and this is not even close to reality), ""he wants me to sign a life estate for him so he knows he won't have to move once we pass away"". That was the one that really got me - this couple tried to manipulate my mom into signing a life estate after dumping over $150k into this new property. 

I know they are con-artists, I know they are manipulating my mom, but I cannot seem to get through to her and my step dad. I worked with a PI and saw the man has used 10+ different versions of his name over the years and 5 different social security numbers. He has addresses and PO boxes in his name from all over the country. I've told my parents and they go through phases where they are concerned and seem to realize what is going on, but then go back to trusting this couple even over their own children. What can I do?

50,Refrain from order details.,1589044761,"I had too much to drink on a handful of occasions a few months ago, at my home. GF lives with us, as does GFs sister. GFs sisters kids visit periodically. Nothing happened, but my girlfriends sisters kids (ages 5 and 7) were present and I was being loud and silly and eventually went to bed. My GFs sister does not like me. She thought it was necessary to get a ""refrain from"" order, saying I cannot consume, be under the influence or possess alcohol in the presence of the children. If I break this, I go to jail. Obviously I do not and have not violated the order out of fear. All has been calm. Because I was not present at the court (I was served at my front door by cops/sherriffs), I have a court date which on the paper says ""Purpose: Return of process"" scheduled next week. A few questions I have (I live in NY):

When I go to the court...what exactly do they need from me? What are they going to ask me? Do I need a lawyer? From my understanding, since I have not violated this order, the judge will ask me if I want to dispute the order, since I was not present with her at the court when this document was obtained, I have any questions and that's it. I continue to do what I'm supposed to.

Secondly, like a fool, I spent a weekend at a friend's house about a week ago and shared a joint with him. I've been so consumed with just not drinking alcohol anywhere, it didn't cross my mind. I know, lesson learned. THC is unrelated to this Refrain from order, but will the courts test me for alcohol usage (and any other drug) and obviously see THC? I'm under the impression family court will only test you if you've violated the refrain from or had any problems or incidences.

Also, since the conduct I am supposed to abide by, says no possession, consumption or under the influence of alcohol ""in the presence of"" the children. Am I allowed to drink away from the house with a friend or collegue, say if I had 1 or two beers at a lunch meeting, and come home 6 hours later bone sober? And believe me, I'm so anxious i have no interest in participating in this. Im just curious.

54,"(AZ, USA) My abusive ex destroyed my stuff",1589044315,"I (19M) was with my abusive ex for about 5 months (24/25M). He was coming out of a bad relationship himself so with barely knowing him, I offered him to stay at my apartment with his cats and dogs (2 dogs and 2 cats). I needed a roommate as mine had just moved out, and I thought it’d be perfect (Im young and stupid I know). I had no idea for the hell I would live in. He was controlling and emotionally manipulative (I couldn’t go to classes because “what about him” and “I didn’t really love him if I went” + any time I would go he’d go into a suicidal rampage). During this time I also had a dog. One day he came home with another dog. Then another. Then another. And cats too. I repeatedly asked him to stop and he never did, and he expected me to solely care for the animals, pay the bills (including 1100/mo rent), all while he never worked and had my bank info so any time I got money he’d immediately use it for himself. Any time I’d confront him he’d go into a suicidal bout and talk about how he should “just kill himself” then. Because of the apartment conditions I eventually developed a kidney infection with an uncommon strain and was completely bathroom/bed ridden. Eventually there were 10 dogs and 10 cats in this apartment (including my now 2 dogs, who I took care of separately and went out of my way to make sure were as healthy as I could provide for and had separate food, toys, and treats). Animal control was called and all animals were seized, I went to court to get my dogs back and spent 2000+ in lawyer fees and general court fees as they said I was an accessory (my parent wound up being able to get my original dog back which sucks I couldn’t get the other one too but hey what’re you going to do). During the court case the cop repeatedly misgendered me (We’re both FtM) and *laughed* when I said I had had a kidney infection and that I’m blind (I was diagnosed at birth with a rare genetic condition, I have the medical documents to back up both these claims) and it was generally awful. The worst though was after the animals were seized I had moved out after my ex had raped me (He got me blackout drunk while he was sober so he could sleep with me thinking it’d get me to stay as he knew after my animals I hated him and didn’t want to be with him and to get away. I already had a friend who was actively trying to help me leave) and my ex squated on the property and wouldn’t let me pick up my stuff. I salvaged what I could from when I had moved out but the rest had to be thrown out, and countless memories with yearbooks and what not were lost because he wouldn’t let me inside. Do I have any legal recourse to get money from him so I can get fees back, money for new stuff or *something*? Sorry this was long.

60,Can I sue my former roommate over last month's rent?,1589043542,"Here's a quick summary of my situation: about seven months ago, I had an emergency and needed to move out of state to be closer to family. I talked it over with my roommate (Mike) at the time, since we were only halfway through our lease and I didn't want to leave him high and dry. He said he was comfortable with me leaving, and instead of breaking our lease wanted to sublet my room to one of his friends (Sarah).

After explaining the situation to our landlord, the landlord said that we would have to sort the details ourselves as far as replacing initial finances (first/last month's rent and security deposit). I first texted Mike to explain that I would send an email asking Sarah for first month's rent (a prorated amount for the month I was moving out, since I had already paid for that full month), last month's rent, and the security deposit in the amount of one month's rent. He agreed that this would be fair. I then sent an email to Mike, Sarah, and CC-ed myself explaining the same thing. After sending it, I got a text from Mike saying that it wasn't fair for Sarah to pay this much because ""nobody has that kind of money to move"" (red flag #1). We went back and forth and eventually agreed that she would not have to worry about the security deposit, since I ""would probably get it back anyways"".

Fast forward to the week I am about to move out, Mike comes tome and explains that it's unfair for Sarah to pay last month's rent and that she should only pay first month's rent (red flag #2). At this point he already knows that I have quit my job and made plans to live in another state, so it's too late for me to stay at this point. I pushed back and explained that I thought it was fair because I essentially already paid her last month of living, and therefore she should pay me back. After going back in forth, Mike verbally agreed to reimburse me for last month's rent. On my move-out day, I was venmo-ed the prorated first month's rent and was told that Mike would venmo me at some point for last month's rent (red flag #3).

Within a few weeks of moving, I tried reaching out to Mike about last month's rent. He never responded. I decided to wait until our last month of the original lease (this month) and then reach out to Sarah to see if she had planned on paying me. I tried reaching out repeatedly over Venmo and text but was ignored. It had been three weeks of me trying to get in touch with her.

My last month's rent was around $750. As someone in their mid-20's with chronic illness, that's a lot of money to me. I'm incredibly anxious because I'm still not sure if I will get my security deposit back, which would total around $1500 lost from this living situation.

It this worth taking my subletter to small claims court for? Do I have a case? I have text and email receipts of agreements for her to pay my last month's rent, but am not sure if this is enough. This has been an incredibly anxious experience and my anxiety would be eased if (at the very least) I could get my last month's rent back.",legaladvice,False,herbal_gerbils,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggj2b6/can_i_sue_my_former_roommate_over_last_months_rent/

I currently reside in California, my dad did too before he passed away in 2016. I'm sure without a doubt that the heir is my mother. Are there fees associated with it? 


Honestly the more I type this up the more I keep thinking eff it, it's not worth the trouble. I'm almost thinking I should've claimed it in his name and deposited it in my mom's account since she has one in case straggler checks in my dad's name come in.",legaladvice,False,TheRavenGrl,/r/legaladvice/comments/ggiemn/unclaimed_money_from_a_medical_officelab_is_in_my/
72,Can I be evicted?,1589041187,"I’m (24F) back again because of my crazy sister L (34F). Several years ago my mom (61F) added L to the deed of her home. My moms reasoning was 2/4 kids were minors, L was in her early to mid 20s. And my mom didn’t have a husband to leave her home to. I believe she was ill advised by her lawyer and L didn’t need to be added to the deed. I still live with my mom while trying to get out of student debt and save for a home. I do not pay rent but my mom has never asked me to and I help out with what I can. L lives in her own home. 

Anyway, let’s fast forward to September 2019. L and I got into an argument over her kids (8F and 4F) making the house messy and having no respect for people’s belongings. One of the kids took a bracelet from me that holds the ashes of a loved one. I was made at L for not disciplining her kids or cleaning up after them. L threatened to put a protective order on me and have me thrown out of my moms house. She did not have cause for this as I never threatened her or became violent. L stated she was my “landlord” and I need to respect her. This caused a huge fight between L and my mom. I’m the youngest and so my mom is very protective of me. My mom asked L to remove her name from the Deed. L refused to sign and told my mom she was dead to her. It took several weeks but things calmed down until March 2020. 

In March my moms health drastically declined. She was in the hospital/rehab for over a month. She is home now. Since admission to the hospital, L went insane. She told the hospital she was an only child and became my moms POA while my mom was unable to make decisions for herself. L refused to update me and my 2 other siblings on my moms progress and told nurses they weren’t allowed to speak with us. I called the hospital prior and they were shocked to find my mom had 3 more kids but they couldn’t do anything to help. This caused a huge fight between my 2 other siblings and myself against L. L again threatened to kick me out of my home. 

It is very stressful to think I could be thrown out of the home I’ve lived in my whole life. I understand with COVID-19 evictions cannot happen right now. I’m worried when this is over what will happen. My mom wants me to stay here. I am the primary caregiver to my mom and she needs me. It’s not good for my mental health knowing L could come here anytime she pleases, move in, or kick me out. Is there anything my mom and I can do to protect me? L and my mom are not speaking currently. A few days ago I had to call the police because L was screaming at my mom and refused to leave. L accused me of stealing from her. I do not have what she wants and I told her it’s somewhere in my moms room but I’m really not sure where. Things have been shuffled and moved around. The police told me they cannot make L leave because she is on the deed. 

I could move out but then the issue of who will take care of my mom comes up. I want to do what’s best for my mom because this may be her last few months. But I also know I need to take care of myself. I’m so stressed out I can’t eat or sleep because of L. She has a history of violence and so does her husband (he was in prison for attempted murder). 

My mom should not be in stressful situations. It makes her confused and stress isn’t good for anyone. If there’s anything we can do please just mention it. We have a lawyer redoing my moms Will and POAs this week.

81,USA - Illinois - Taking contract freelance work while furloughed. Will I lose my unemployment benefits?,1589040222,"I was furloughed at the end of March until July due to COVID-19. I've been asking around but I'm not sure what I should do here.

I have an opportunity for some small freelance work. Nothing major or full time. A couple hundred here and there. Some weeks it may add up to full time work.

Here's the elephant in the room: if I take this freelance work, it would go against what I get paid out in unemployment, and on certain weeks it may completely eradicate my weekly benefits. So if I make 600 or so a week, I would be ineligible to receive any amount of UI, including the extra 600. So I'm making less as a result, but I'm being productive and have opportunities to make money.

I am, however, worried that due to something vague in employment law, if I work enough, I will be considered fully ""self-employed"" and thus lose my benefits altogether when I really want to make extra cash and fully intend on going back to my job full-time once the furlough ends.

I regularly have my dogs on all types of preventatives, veterinary preventatives, over the counter, collars, ointments,  pills.  I've used preventatives on my carpet, flea traps and diatomaceous earth. The main problem is it is coming from the grass outside. I've found this out by giving my dogs a flea bath, taking them outside immediately after and by the time i bring them back inside they're covered again. I have also done the white sock test and watched them physically jump on my socks while I was outside. I've already informed the complex about the problem outside and they keep saying they're going to handle it but it's been months. At this point it has made it's way inside on to the carpet and it just keeps getting worse. My dogs constantly have fleas and it has gotten to the point to where the fleas are occasionally jumping on my wife and myself, and biting us as well. 

After speaking to the community manager asking for replacement floors, (She said she can't do that because we're on the second floor), asking to be transferred (She said no because she wants to fumigate and try and handle the problem with our carpet first). Or for them to just break out lease (She said no). We asked for a number for corporate but no one ever answers the phone it's just automated. She keeps saying she won't move forward with anything because she needs to fumigate first. 

Our problem is that with my wife is always working and myself as well we have no time to be able to move everything out the apartment for 4 hours. I work in sales for a dealership and we never have time off, like i actually have no vacation time at all so i can't ask off.

Even if we were able to move everything out for a day, nothing is going to prevent the fleas from coming back inside. They need to treat the complex. When I mentioned that she said that she doesn't know if she can..???? It's a never ending cycle.

I gave her the mail and we let it go... to be completely honest I didn't really mind the very few junk mail anyways I would just throw them away...As time progressed,  I moved to paying all bills online and stopped checking the mail as frequently. If I had gotten anything associated with her name that was junk mail I'd send it to the manager and eventually just stopped out of annoyance ( I would just leave it in my mailbox since most of it was junk mail ; Also, I stopped sifting through to figure out which ones I should send to Sam).

I took a recent interest into creating suck a book but I thought about just referencing the stories and evolving their plots (not citing direct words, exact scenarios, names, places etc.) I would probably exaggerate some to the extent that they couldn't be tracked back to the original content.

By doing so, would I be stealing intellectual property?
I plan on getting all kinds of tales about experiences in the field that I'm interested in other ways as well by interviewing some of my former coworkers about the topic and asking on social media for stories if people want to contribute.

Would writing as a disclaimer that all the stories are inspired by experiences of colleagues of the trade but ate partly fictitious be enough to not become liable to lawsuits?

96,What is the statute of limitations for violating an order of protection in New York?,1589038686,"A friend of mine had an order of protection placed against his (now) ex-girlfriend in New York in 2016. During the 90 days she was supposed to stay away she repeatedly violated it by contacting and coming to see him. He did not report her at the time, and I'm wondering if he could now show evidence of the contacts to get her in trouble.

They are no longer together but she recently started contacting him again. I'm wondering if he could expose her violation of the order of protection - or at least threaten her with doing so? Would they care since it's been a few years? Just want to know the facts on this.",legaladvice,False,IdLikeSomeAdvicePlz,/r/legaladvice/comments/gghilb/what_is_the_statute_of_limitations_for_violating/
97,My younger brother has been harassed online by the same people for close to 3 years.,1589038660,"For the past 3 years or so, my younger brother has had his “old high school friends” coming into his twitch streams with accounts like “OPsBroisafaggot” “OPsbroisan1gger” etc. they come in and harass him and try to embarrass him. Each time the accounts get blocked, they make more. Last night they came back for more while he was streaming with his new girlfriend and humiliated in front of her. He came into my room with tears in his eyes asking for help and I didn’t know what to do. 

I talked to a local police officer and he said there’s close to nothing the police can do and since “just deleting his account” would make the harassment go away that’s what he suggested. 

My brother makes money, sometimes a couple hundred bucks a month off of his twitch account. “Just deleting the account” would be like shutting down your business because the local drunk won’t stop coming in and the police won’t do anything. 

We live in Utah, for reference.

98,Sharing my MeToo story on Twitter,1589038622,"Tara Reade's latest interview gave me flashbacks of when I had something of the sort happen to me. 

I posted a tweet with my personal story and tagging the company where it happened.

I no longer work there and its been 10+ years since I got fired. Am I legally in trouble for having shared my story and tagging them as well?",legaladvice,False,nonamaejo,/r/legaladvice/comments/gghhwz/sharing_my_metoo_story_on_twitter/
99,"When I go back to work, I will be expected to commit tax fraud.",1589038608,"Hi, I'm a horse and I'm in a bit of a bind at work.

I'm a ""salesman"" at work by title, but really I got delegated to take care of the sales legwork. I fill in orders, make sure they ship, fill out the required tax forms including a shipping label and commercial invoice, and do the same for when someone needs a part to repair our products or for whatever reason.

Until I left for corona leave, there was a woman who oversaw the whole process. Really I was easing her job, so she just knew how everything was done at my company. She always wanted me to give false values on the commercial invoices and other forms ""for tax reasons"" which I'm pretty sure is a sly way of saying ""so we can commit tax fraud."" These are often $100,000-200,000 products we list as $200, or at the very least $5,000 listed for $5. The second happens every day, the first more like monthly. I did this because it was a part of my job, but I made sure to let them know I'm uncomfortable with this and the only reason I'm doing it is because my overseer was always the one to put her signature on it, leaving me blameless (?). (Note: I think I'm on one or two of the earlier ones, before I realized that something sketchy is happening.) Well of course while I was gone they shat on her and she left. Now I'm going to be expected to do the same, but I don't want to break any laws for a sketchy company I don't even like.

What are my options past contacting a lawyer? 

Would I be held legally responsible for what I've done so far? 

Should I be turning these people in?

I've seen the IRS gives a reward for people who help with significant cases of tax fraud, is this something I can claim a reward on? Would I be incriminated to the point I could not get a reward? Am I looking at jail time?",legaladvice,False,NotReallyAHorse,/r/legaladvice/comments/gghhrw/when_i_go_back_to_work_i_will_be_expected_to/
