3,3,Need help trying to detect a song and turn on a powerstrip,1601577870,"*Apologies if this is the wrong sub. TL;DR at the end*

We live on the busy main street of our neighborhood and COVID has hit the businesses pretty hard. In fact of the 9 shops on our block, it looks like only one is going to survive to the end of the year. Most of them are boarded up because we're only a few blocks from where the protests usually gather, but the one that just went out of business below us hasn't been yet, and our building owner told us we can decorate it for the holidays!

Why I'm here: the landlord told me I can't have lights and a train running all the time, and while it would be easy enough to set up a timer, I had this merry idea that's very far beyond my abilities: Wouldn't it be fun if singing a Christmas carol turned on all the lights and decorations?

I have no idea if that's possible or how to accomplish it but I figured maybe someone here could help. I just love the idea of hearing carolers and having something fun for the neighborhood that's powered by cheer when there's so little of it around lately.

If you have any ideas on how to accomplish the technological side of this I would really appreciate it. I'm a capable woodworker and my neighbor is great with electrical. I'm prepared to drop some coin to make this happen but trying not to go crazy as I just had my salary cut.

9,9,"What are the advantages to going to an ""Engineering School"" vs. going to a public University",1601574130,"Hello community,

I have been doing a lot of research as to where I'm going to go to pursue my bachelors. For context, I'm a sophmore (27M) and already have been back and forth the fence as to which university/school to go to (USA).

Circumstances:

My technical/community college pushes MSOE(Milwaukee School of Engineering) very strongly, and so a lot of my friends strongly urge everybody studying Electrical Engineering to pursue the same track. All credits transfer nicely, and the school itself is pretty proactive regarding financial aid packages and scholarships given to the students. Even so, the cost of going to this school is very high (a simple google search yields \~ $55k/year) without financial aid and scholarships and an estimated slightly more affordable ($23k/year). The cost of attending this school is just... so much money compared to...

&amp;#x200B;

My local university UWM (University of Milwaukee) would cost about $9k/year without aid and scholarships.

&amp;#x200B;

Goals as an Engineer:

My main goal would be to be better compensated in the workplace, that is to say having a better paying job with full benefits. Also, to be much more financially stable, to buy a home some day and truly save and start an actual IRA or other investment portfolios.

Secondary goal would be to contribute in some way, small or big, to the current improvement of the global climate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Concerns about my educational path:

My main concern is being able to payback (within a reasonable amount of time) the amount of loans I have already accrued going to my community college. Is going to an ""Engineering"" school worth the money investment or is going to a public university a much more efficient use of my time and money. I ask because although I have decided to pursue public university, many of my student colleagues urge me to go to MSOE, but I wanted to hear from real engineers in the field and how their educational paths have affected their careers and their lives.

Everything has been great so far; I love the people, the work, and the cause. My job has been surprisingly a lot of hand calculations which I'm really happy with. My team tends to be within 4-8 other mechanicals depending on the project. 

The biggest road bump I've run into so far hasn't been learning how to apply my knowledge from school, but moreso how to have confidence in the work I complete. I understand that I'm brand new and  can't be anywhere near perfect but it feels like every time I speak with the senior engineers I work closely with, I find myself apologizing for every little thing, even things that aren't my fault. Some of these other engineers are incredibly smart and experienced in the field to the point where I'm intimidated. I always assume I did my calculations completely wrong with the wrong assumptions and have no confidence in anything I ""submit"" to the other engineers on my team.

I should also add that although it may not directly make a difference, I have been working from home since I started and have never met any of my co-workers in person. Hopefully soon that changes!

17,17,Company has no Technical Career Path. Red Flag or Possible Opportunity?,1601562937," I have worked at this company for roughly 2 years (as an application engineer). When I first joined, all of the employees and management made it seem like it was very easy and encouraged to move around &amp; move up into other roles within the organization. This is one aspect that really drew me in when I joined-as I aspire to be a technical leader in the future. So far I'm really enjoying the technology, products, and people (for the most part). I feel like I'm still learning things. But ultimately I forsee myself coming to a cross roads in a few years-with learning as an engineer here. I have seen multiple seasoned engineers here quit or get let go who were later in their career which makes me think there is no incentive to stay past mid-career....more to come.

Fast forward to earlier this year, and I'm settled into my role. Our company rolls out some career progression template to everyone. Due to the fact that it is a very flat organization, and supervisors/managers have all sorts of weird direct reports or none even. It makes no sense. So it looks like they tried to take a stab at making some sort of logic out of roles &amp; progression since prior to earlier this year, nothing existed in the company!

But the thing is, my company has not talked about career progression since! Until recently. In my most recent 1-1 with my meeting with my boss I brought up this career template. Career progression for an engineer is:

engineer -&gt; senior engineer -&gt;engineering supervisor (which my boss is). That's it!

No more roles after that. So I ask my boss about this, and he has no idea about this career path worksheet, and says he needs to look into it more. When asking about how I can progress in my career at this company, he states that: 'you will either have to join sales, or marketing-that's probably your best bet.'

However, none of those 2 functions interest me.

So from what I've gathered, my company rolled out this career progression worksheet, my boss has no idea what it is (and no one really knows how report chains work here), and suggested to me that I switch functions if I want to move up and get more growth here.

I'm curious-is this a red flag? Maybe I'm just overthinking things and titles are just titles?

I'm also thinking that perhaps I can pitch a role to the leadership at the company-some sort of leadership role blended with technical things, and see if they bite?

18,18,Help with test bench fixture design,1601562111,"Hi,

I am designing a test bench to assess the performance of a turbine and I am having trouble in how to keep the assembly in place.

The mechanical portion of the test bench is comprised of the turbine, whose shaft connects via coupling to a torque transducer, which is itself connected to a DC brushless motor (via coupling as well). The couplings are only strictly rigid at the rotational direction and can take a bit of misalignment in the other directions.

I am designing some supports for the torque transducer and DC motor. The turbine has supports already. All of them are supposed to be kept at the same level by their supports and then bolted to a fixture.

My issue now is how to design this fixture. I'm thinking that this would be machined in house. We have a workshop at our department, but it's not free, we have to pay for the cost of materials and machining.

I was thinking about just getting a slab of aluminum or steel and machining the threaded holes for the support bolts for each component and having slots in the supports to account for gaps and misalignments.

20,20,Best control system for linear output?,1601558301,"I have a system where either cold or hot water (let's say 20 and 80 degrees celcius) passes through. The system should switch between the two, but for practical reasons there is a period of time when the two mix. Ten seconds. The curve in temperature however should be as linear as possible, in order to get the best balance between quick switching and limiting deformation due to temperature changes. 

I was thinking of doing it with a PID-controller, seeing as that was the controller of choice at my university. However those always had outputs that were logistic(like) curves, where they were only 'linear' for a moment at the point where the output was increasing the quickest before slowing down again as the output approached the target value.

Seeing as the maximum temperature of the water is fixed at 80 degrees celcius, I don't think I have to worry about overshoot since no higher output is physically possible. Because of that I'm thinking of making the controller react very strong so the maximum change in temperature is reached quickly and the output will continue increasing linearly until the target value is reached. However I am sure that would mean the target value would be reached before the ten seconds, which is undesirable.

My question essentially comes down to:

Is a PID-controller even the right fit? If so, how would I go about finding the right tuning for a linear output if the settling time needs to be close to a specific value.

29,29,"If the EU is so focused on Euro emissions standards, why is there not more focus on truck design?",1601548747,"So this is gonna sound like a bit of guesswork, and it is.

However as a truck driver, I full on believe that I can *feel* the extra resistance when driving a Cabover truck versus a bonneted truck.

Plus from my experience, our Bonnet trucks got better economy over our new Cabovers at work.

The old bonnet trucks did around 650km from 400l of Diesel, these were running Mack Engines designed in the 70's, so an economy of 61.54l/100km at 55 tonnes

The new trucks are a tad heavier, I've not had one past 60 tonnes, however we get down to 350km from 400l of Diesel, which comes to 114.29l/100km on some runs.

The new heavy transporter (low loader) can get, on a good day, 200l/100km and if terrain is bad, even less, but that's in excess of 100 tonnes.

However then you go across to companies that make bonnet trucks, so for example the drag co-efficient of a Tesla Semi is 0.35, most Bonnet trucks get around 0.5 and most Cabovers get as high as 0.9

So it makes me think if anyone knows how to reduce aerodynamic drag, it would be Tesla, so they clearly picked a bonnet truck for a reason.

Now, to me, even with the DPF and DEF and all the other emissions gear, the fact that our new trucks that are Euro 5 are chewing damn near double the fuel of our old trucks at a similar weight makes me wonder, is this Euro 5 Emissions stuff actually achieving anything?

Would Manufacturers possibly see better gains from making more aerodynamic bonnet trucks? I get that you might have to knock maybe 2-4 pallet spaces off a trailer to get the overall length to be the same, to remain under dimension limits, however if you're spending half the money on fuel, surely those savings could stack up over 1,000,000kms?

For reference, our Cabovers will chew 1,142,900 litres of fuel, the old truck would chew 615,400 litres, so a saving of 527,500 litres over the life of the truck, or at current Australian prices of $1.19/l that's around $627,725 AUD per truck, so a fleet of trucks us a massive fuel saving

So looking at a cost of $2.05/km on average to operate a truck in Australia, and an average 45ft trailer so for 26 pallets that's around $0.07884615/pallet/km

So freight of 1,500km as an average would be $118.27/pallet per trip

So if your average trip is 1,500km then you would get 666 trips out of your truck per million kilometres.

So that's $78,767.82 earned by that truck per pallet space, so removing 2 pallet spaces would lose $157,535.64 over the lifetime of the truck, 4 spaces would lose $315,071.28 so even losing 4 whole pallet spaces to run a bonnet truck to a Cabover would still net you a saving over the life of the truck of around $312,654 if the fuel savings I've observed hold true.

So yeah, it's got me wondering why Euro Emissions aren't calling for more efficient truck shapes, and instead seem to focus on engines and exhaust emissions?

Is there a practical reason why Cabovers are still preferred by European truck Manufacturers and why a lot of the trucks coming out now to Euro emissions standards, even from companies like Kenworth are pushing Cabovers, with the bonnet trucks being more focused on the heavy lifting (Like the T909 being aimed at Road Train work and the Mack Titan being targeted at Heavy Haulage) where economy and emissions aren't as much of a concern?",AskEngineers,False,Rumbuck_274,/r/AskEngineers/comments/j364x9/if_the_eu_is_so_focused_on_euro_emissions/

37,37,Windows Environment Variables and Values,1601529967," So, I'm taking a class on you Udemy about Git. In the due course of the class the instructor led us through a session where we configured Git with Windows in order to quickly access it via the command prompt. In order to do this the instructor led us through editing system variables in Windows. 

In particular, we edited the `PATH` variable. Though I've recently graduated with my CS degree I was never really instructed on the use of Windows system variables. Being new to the concept, I decided to do some research to better understand what it was that I was configuring. Thanks to that research I've been able to understand exactly what path variables are and how they work, with one exception. I don't understand how the values are set.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me be clear, I do understand that system variables work very much like json, with two strings, one being the value and the other being the variable name. What I failed understand is that after I set the `PATH` (the value) of a particular system variable, say to execute a program from the command prompt, I don't understand how the OS knows the name of the typed program.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps a scenario will help explain what I mean:

Let us say that I wish to run chrome from the command prompt without typing in the full system path.

 I go to my system variables and I add chrome's EXE to the end of my `PATH` system variable. I then go to my command prompt and type in ""chrome,"" it brings up my browser. 

How is it that the system knew to connect the keyword ""chrome"" with the particular path I set in the system variable? In traditional programming, say in an array, I could set the name and then set the value. To access the value, the program would associate the `array_name[index]` with the value of that index. In the case of programming therefore, I set both the name and value. But in OS system variables I only set the value, and the OS seems to know intuitively what name to associate with it. How is this achieved?",AskEngineers,False,Zdragon1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/j32jn6/windows_environment_variables_and_values/

So I currently attend a university as a geology major that does not have good career outlooks. Because of that, for the last several months I have been looking into engineering fields to pursue &amp; settled on computer engineering.

My issue is that my university requires I ""apply"" for their computer engineering major and that I have to meet their prerequisites. Unfortunately they need 11 STEM credits and I've only got 10, meaning I have to spend another semester before I can actually apply to the major.

So as a result I've spent the last few weeks looking into other colleges rather than waste my time hoping to make it into an engineering program 9 months from now. I've recently applied to some and just got accepted to one, but my question is, is it worth to pursue?

Would it be worth to completely leave my home institution, the one I have grown to be familiar of for the past year, in order to pursue computer engineering at another institution? And that being said, if the college I transfer to is seen as more or less a downgrade when looking at the rankings, would it still be worth it at all?

I am mostly doing laboratory photonic and RF stuff. Here is my experience so far..

My coworkers have been pretty accepting of me. I suspect I have some form of autism or more intense than average social anxiety. I have a horrible habit of spacing out when people talk to me (not good when people are explaining things verbally) and have a tendency to get confused very easily. I also have poor short term memory. When I was in school, I mitigated this by just forceful studying however the work place is much much more complicated. You have to keep track of many things at once and be able to work on a team. I have extremely poor interpersonal skills. When people are having a conversation I often don't understand the humor or banter they use. I am usually many steps behind other people. I think slowly. Whenever I have to talk in front of people my voice becomes strangled and shakes and I start turning red in the face. I am 23 years old so I guess this will never go away.

The thing that makes me nervous is that many people in the field dislike people who do not have a passion for what they do. They don't like people who think that it's ""just a job"". The reason why I went into engineering was for a stable career where I could find some area I could be useful in given my issues. I really couldn't tell you if I have a passion for it. I really don't have passion for anything. Whenever guidance counselors asked me what I wanted to do with my life I just gave them bullshit answers. However in the workplace I find everything complicated. The job I have is fairly relaxed if you are a smart person but I am not a smart person. I feel so lost most of the time I don't even know what questions to ask. In meetings I hardly ever understand what is going on and I feel anxious as hell. My brain is very illogical and I find it hard to have a coherent chain of thought. I hate feeling like a burden on my team by people having to constantly re-explain things over and over. People have been nice so far but I fear that eventually the niceness will run out and people will just get sick of me and then I would be at a loss with what to do after that.

I have thought about just changing careers and going to trade school to learn something that's hopefully more procedural and straight forward. However, I know everyone in my life would think I am a loser for doing that and I have a history of quitting everything already.

73,73,New Engineer working as a subcontractor in in hopes of starting a business. I need advice!,1601492993,"Hello everyone. I want to get the advice of anyone who has started a business in the engineering/technology space.

I am a recent graduate (2018) with a B.S. in Aeronautical Systems engineering technology. Due to being a primary care provider of my father (he suffered from Alzheimer’s prior to passing), my grades suffered while I was in school. I managed to gracile with a 2.55 and, as most would imagine I could not secure an internship, much less a job, from any employer. When I did secure a job, it was for a position managing a small public school’s IT network and computer fleet. The compensation was next to nothing with no benefits.

I currently I work as a subcontractor for my business partner’s associate. Right now, the job provides easy money as an on-site installer for a VOIP phone company called [Weave](https://www.getweave.com). I install their phones, forward their calls to a temp number and train their staff to use the phones. I’m planning to train in running ethernet cables with a associate of mine. This will open the door to a higher rate of pay as an installer (I’m told that I can charge per line I drop as well as an hourly rate).

This is where I am currently.  My next goal is to grow my knowledge and experience in IT, but I am stuck. Id love some advice on how to build my knowledge. Any resources that you can point me to are welcome. I’d also love some business advice from those you’ve started engineering/consulting firms.

78,78,"Is it a bad idea to tell the interviewer that you have other interviews scheduled, and an offer from their competitors to speed up the process and maybe salary?",1601490533,"Hi, 

A little bit of backstory, so I made a post about 3 months ago \[[Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/haw1l6/a_company_wants_me_to_talk_and_present_my_work/)\], my interview with company-A was delayed for 2 months so I didn't get an interview until early September. It took about 3 weeks (last week) for them to come back saying they are interested in giving me the position but we have yet to talk about salary or have it written down yet. The company-A told me they are waiting for everything calm down a bit (due to the fiscal year ends today) before they would proceed with the next step. Which makes me uneasy, consider it took them 2 months to schedule an interview, I 'm not sure how long I would have to wait for them for a final offer, It could be another 2 months, and they also still can rescind the offer.  I only have a year of experience so I'm not exactly valuable or have any negotiating power. Then I found out I might get laid off very soon at my current company due to a contract problem so I decided to start applying for more jobs last week since I have to support my family so I can't be unemployed for too long. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far I have around 5 companies who want to interview me for a position. These companies are also big corporations (LH, NG, AeroCorp, etc) so I expect it will also take them forever to get anything done. I know there are processes in place and I don't want to make them think I'm being needy or impatient. But do you think  If I tell each of them about other options I have, it would help (indirectly ) fast track the process and give me a bit of negotiating power?

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't usually negotiate with people and just took whatever people give me and I think It was a mistake on my part. Some of my male co-workers end up having way higher salaries than me because they were able to negotiate for a better salary.

I am working at a major office building in the sustainability department. We operate a restaurant where we almost achieved full circularity - but then COVID hit. Now we serve food in single-use plastic containers that rarely get recycled. 

We are looking for a smart system to serve food in reusable packaging (i.e. tupperware), and make sure that the packaging gets returned when our customers are finished eating. 

Our idea thus far is a token based system, where the customer pays 5$ for a token, which is taken by our cashier at check-out. They then get their food served in the tupperware. They are free to take this to another area of the office building and eat, or stay in the restaurant and eat there. When they are done, we will have some sort of machine in the reception area, where they can return the tupperware and get a token back. The tupperware gets cleaned in our industry dishwashing machines. The token being worth 5$ is of value to them, and they can keep using it to get their tupperware every day. 

Now, the two challenges to this are:

- Multiple items. We want our customers to not carry with them more than one token, as more than this will be a hassle. If they take multiple items (such as a sandwich box and a salad box), how can we account for this without having them pay for multiple tokens?

- The return machine. We are thinking of having QR-code stickers on the tupperware that gets scanned by the machine, and then disposes a token. The specifics of this machine are still a bit fuzzy. Any good ideas here?

i want to make a display with ferrofluid in it so that I can play around with it and electromagnets. im an electrical eng though so im not confident in my box making abilities so want to check things over.

why dont i just buy a watertight perspex box?

im not sure where i'd get one from. I want it to be really thin and also want to be able to seal it once i've got the ferrofluid inside. That seems like a niche buy to me? i dunno maybe it isnt, i feel like my box making skills need improvement though cause i keep running into problems everytime I need one.

So could i cut and slot wooden panels so that perspex windows slot into them, then add silicon sealant around the edges? then just screw it all together? would that be enough to make it watertight or would i need to coat the wood in something or add rubber seals somehow or something else entirely?

127,27,"Cultural attitude to the Engineering profession, UK vs US",1601424311,"Is there a noticeable difference in the cultural attitudes of engineering/technical professions between UK and US cultures?   


There's a common perception (at least from my experience) that the engineering/technical field is more respected in the US from a cultural level. Of course, this is a highly generalized claim, as wildly varying personal experiences are likely to obscure any general trend (providing it exists in the first place).   


In the UK, ""engineering"" is a very loose term. Unlike some parts of the world, engineering is not a regulated profession, one can claim he/she is an engineer outside of a formal/legal framework (unless they have a CENG, IEng). It gives the word a much more versatile application. A firm can advertise for the position of a ""weldings engineer"", requiring someone with vocational qualifications+hands on experience, and not necessarily an academically qualified person with some fundamental knowledge of metallurgy, thermodynamics etc. In many parts of the world, they'll be called technicians or just welders? In summary, engineers are mishmashed with technicians and mechanics, at least culturally. Which often makes it really difficult to explain what your job.   


I think it's much less ambiguous in the US? There's also a salary perspective. Engineers in the US get paid more, in general. How much does the cultural perception (in terms of value) set the bar for engineering salaries, and their ability to negotiate for a higher one? Of course, it's mostly set by market value/demand, like most places in the world, so it might be a dumb question. And I'm aware of multiple other factors that contribute to the higher salaries in the US, like a much stronger economy (per capita basis), bigger industries, extremely wealthy cities etc.  


But there's a perception that engineers just aren't respected enough in the UK, whereas it's a much more respected profession in the US. How true is this?",AskEngineers,False,Energia91,/r/AskEngineers/comments/j2bd9p/cultural_attitude_to_the_engineering_profession/

Here the  Aerospace program has the reputation of being the hardest bachelor of  all. One of my best friends does it and from what he has told me, I  believe him. It's a quite strict and busy bachelor. And they have  selection, so most of them are really smart people that got in.

Mechanical  on the other hand, has no selection so many people who were unsure end  up leaving or don't do s!@t, 3-4 courses instead of 5-6 simultaneously  and is a little more relaxed but still busy. We also have projects every  quarter.

This is a busted water pump from a machine at work that I took apart cause the tech was throwing it out and I was curious as to how it worked.

Googling didn't help much since I don't know what terms to use.

The yellow hose is silicone(?), serves as both the water input and output and doesn't seem to have any holes in it.

The three white cylinders are just plain plastic stuffed inside with no attachments.
I don't know if they are supposed to turn, if that's even possible given that they all touch each other.

The metal bit in the center is the axle of the 24v (3700RPM) DC motor.

The area around the white cylinders is wet but I don't think it is supposed to be because the housing isn't water tight and the pump was leaking and making a humming/chugging noise. Interestingly the machine has 4 pumps with the inputs in series and when the first pump died it killed the other pumps in line one after an other.

So my questions are:
1. How does the axle turn the white cylinders?

I’ve been told that everyone is different so, if you’ve passed the FE exam, can you tell me how you prepared, link to resources you used, and any hindsight tips.

Thank you all in advance!

198,98,Concrete building floor vibrations- can I dampen by adding weight?,1601349254,"I live in a high rise concrete building where the floor has noticeable vibrations from people walking and run machines in other units. In certain areas of my unit there is almost a (very subtle) ""trampoline"" effect when I walk. I can literally feel the floor give and return with my 190 lb steps. 

I have done some research, read about the causes (cheaper thinner concrete floor slabs, bad design), read about many of the fixes (expensive and intrusive), but also read that sometimes the cause is that the floor is underloaded versus the design load, and adding weight can help to solve the problem. Apparently there has been a major shift in the weight of appliances, electronics, furniture, etc, and the stuff in peoples condos just weighs much less than it used to. And to be honest I did not notice this vibration for a very long time and I think it got worse after a particular neighbor moved out. I am wondering if they had lots of heavy furniture that they took with them.

Firstly, is that solution actually possible, or is it just a pipe dream? Could adding a feasible amount of weight (maybe up to several hundred pounds, but definitely less than 1,000 lbs) to the floor of my apartment actually dampen the vibrations?

Secondly, could I test it out with water, or would the sloshing of the water negate any dampening effect? I was doing brainstorming and came up with the idea that the cheapest and easiest way for me to load the floor of my apartment with significant additional weight would be by buying 30 gallon barrels, which I could fill with water from the tap, which would each weigh \~250 lbs. The idea would be to test the concept and then invest in heavy planters or furniture after showing it works. But would water even serve as a valid test?

Third, how would I determine the best places to put the water? Would it be in the places with the most ""trampolining""? Would it be along the common walls with neighbors?

Finally, do you have any other explanations from structural engineering as to why floor vibrations would have changed over time, other than shifting floor loadings?",AskEngineers,False,tax_scam_throwaway,/r/AskEngineers/comments/j1r9g0/concrete_building_floor_vibrations_can_i_dampen/

The actual work is very interesting since it is mostly IR&amp;D (in my experience much more interesting than the work most engineers do at the larger defense contractors). However the work is slow and the pay is just average. I worked hard to graduate the top of my class and get a job working on 'cool' stuff,  yet I have classmates making roughly the same salary in far less competitive engineering roles and companies where all they do is punch numbers into excel spreadsheets and make presentations. Are the 'cool' engineering jobs just generally more competitive with the same or even lower pay? 

Here's my dilemma. While I really enjoy my current role, I don't want to stay technical forever, but also I haven't heard great things from becoming an engineering manager...long hours and still average pay.  I feel that I will get burnt out of the technical route in a couple years, and started to realize that if I focus and solve problems as well as I do in my current role, I could make much more money doing anything else. 

I am tempted that a career in software engineering is far more lucrative with a variety of opportunities in different industries.

I got a job for a large Tier-1 automotive supplier as a supplier quality engineer. Things were great for the first week then things started to go downhill fast. All day long I am either getting yelled out by one of our suppliers, customers or coworkers or being told my bosses and their bosses to straight up lie about data that is collected and supposed to be distributed out.

I am 3 weeks through my first term in electrical engineering and I am afraid that I may have made the wrong decision. 

When I came to school I was thinking that I wanted to do mechanical engineering as it had a lot of avenues. In first year I was (in my opinion) quite good at 3D modelling, maybe not the best but it came pretty naturally to me. So much so that I got to work as a CAD intern at a company for the summer, which was mostly boring intern work but I got to do a bit of new part modelling at the end of the summer. 

I eventually decided to go into electrical because I have family in it and our school's discipline showcase made me excited about being able to work on technology in a field that seems like will only keep growing.

My problem though at this point is that I have yet to really enjoy it... Partly it is due to how bad our department is at my school, and COVID online learning has not been fun on its own. But this material is not coming very naturally to me. I'm mediocre at best with programming (however after this year I don't think programming is really mandatory anymore). 

Was anyone else in a similar position? Was there something that made you change you mind and end up loving it? I have been considering more and more to switch into mechanical if I am able to.

232,32,Recent Grad - What's the best way tell an interviewer about my DUI?,1601320468,"Hey there guys,  


The title kind of says it all. About 18 months ago I made the greatest mistake of my life. Chalk it up to a toxic college environment and being out of touch with myself. I will officially be tried and charged within the next few months, and the charge will officially appear on my record.

The experience was very challenging but overall wound up being overwhelmingly positive, because it forced me to confront my unhealthy college habits, taught me a lot about myself, and brought me to really buckle down on life. There is no excuse for my mistake- I am just overwhelming grateful that I got pulled over and that no one was hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout this time, I had been working for an automotive manufacturer, interning under the program manager for the projects team. The work experience (1y 10m) was great and has set me up well. When this event went down, I told my  hiring manager. He was understanding and explained that as long as it never affected the quality of my work then he had no problem with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Interviews are all about creating a good first impression, and it really sucks to have to mar my first impression with an employer with this detail - but better they find out from me rather than when doing a background search.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I drop this piece of information in the interview? I've read that, in psychology, people are disproportionately influenced by the first and last pieces of information they receive. I'm conflicted as whether or not I should drop this piece of information mid interview, or if I should wait till the very end to spill the beans. 

Would it be distasteful or unwise to use this as an example of ""a hardship that you had to get past"", which is a common question for entry level positions?

Regardless, I plan on emphasizing the following:  
\- that it was a one-off mistake, however grave, and that there's no excuse for it regardless.

and

\- that it has never and will never impact my work, and that this can be corroborated by my old higher-ups listed in my references. Additionally, it took place 1 1/2 years ago and my work since that time speaks for itsself.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you best receive this sort of information if you were interviewing someone? Should I emphasize anything more/less?

Also, how F\*cked do you think I am because of this? I would like a gage as to how this information would impact your impression of a potential candidate for a position.

233,33,Ampere's law with two wires from power supply,1601320405,I've been thinking about how Ampere's law affects wires. For my example it's a 5V and ground wire from a power supply and for example they're 22 AWG. If they are to be connected to another external board then what would happen? Since current flows from 5V to the board then back to the supply through the ground wire then there is a current loop which means that there is a magnetic field generated by the wires. Due to this wouldn't this also mean that the wire will be repelled from another based off the right hand rule? What would also occur in the other case if the current flows in both directions? I'd expect them to pull towards each other. Is this also why many cabling are twisted pairs?

236,36,I feel like I’ve forgotten everything I learned since I graduated a few years ago. Terrified after working in an unrelated industry for a year.,1601317407,"Saw a similar post about not knowing anything after graduating and thought I would try my hand at advice for my particular situation. 

I struggled a lot in undergrad. Took me almost 7 years to graduate with over a 3.0 GPA but a ~2.7 technical GPA. A lot of this came from undiagnosed mental illnesses that finally were identified when I was a junior. The following years were equally difficult as I tried to find a combination of medication and strategies to help. All in all, I’m incredibly lucky to have graduated, and privileged to have had professors that let me make up work after the term due to a breakdown in my last year. Despite these setbacks, I’m still immensely proud of myself for stepping back from the “edge” countless times. My medication has been effective thankfully, I haven’t had a panic attack in almost two years, and very few depressive episodes. 

After graduating, I applied everywhere I could find. I got discouraged because my gpa and technical knowledge were clearly lacking. Years to get a degree and I felt like I knew nothing. I had only one technical interview that I just could not understand. It felt like (and still feels like) those years were wasted because I didn’t know anything. After months of applying, I finally got an offer for a large company. However, the position was not in engineering.  Little to no technical skills and lots of soft skills in a client facing role. Completely unrelated to my degree, more related to a business degree to be honest. Exhausted after job searching, happy to see a high salary to support myself, I accepted. 

Ever since then, I’ve slowly started to regret this choice. I work 10-12 hour days in a position that I wasn’t passionate about. My round trip commute is 4 hours. Remote work due to the pandemic has been a blessing and it’s made me realize that the pace I was going with this position wasn’t sustainable for my mental health. I want to start looking for other positions, but I’m terrified. 

I don’t remember my coursework. I don’t remember all that I learned. I wasn’t even a strong student to begin with. But I love engineering. Any chance I get to try to inject /something/ technical to my job, I leap at the chance. 

I’m truly scared that I will burn out at this position and be unable to find any engineering jobs with years out of college and no practical experience. I haven’t been able to learn via experience on the job due to my completely unrelated position. Has anyone had a similar experience and been able to “bounce back” into a technical field? I would try to refresh my memory and study my EIT but I truly cannot keep up with a 50-60 hour workload, meet my basic sleep/dietary/exercise/mental health needs, and study. I feel like somethings gotta give.

250,50,"What would be the disadvantages of a 2 stroke engine built with all the same modern technology that modern 4 stroke auto engines are built with? Wouldn't the mechanisms they have added to the 4 stroke design (fi, di, vvt/l/d, egr, etc) fix all the major downsides of the 2 stroke?",1601308123,"I have been reading about 2 stroke and 4 stroke engines and it struck me that the comparisons being made are always assuming relatively archaic engines. Yes, I see how if this was the 1930's, the 4 stroke has major advantages over the two stroke.

But the engines being sold in today's cars are much more complicated than those designs. A significant percent of cars sold today come with some form of forced induction and a major new trend is electric superchargers that can provide any level of boost independent of exhaust pressure and engine speed. These cars have variable valve timing, lift, and duration. They have direct injection. And they are getting even more complicated with EGR systems and variable compression ratios and HCCI and all this stuff that to me, completely rewrites the question of 2 stroke vs 4 stroke.

For example, if you had an electric supercharger, couldn't you completely separate induction from the crankshaft, and solve the 2 stroke's lubrication and volumetric efficiency disadvantages? As in, completely solve them, the 2 stroke would be able to have dedicated crankshaft lubrication just like a 4 stroke, it would be able to load as much air into a cylinder in any condition as a 4 stroke. It would also mean that you wouldnt have to mix in oil and wouldnt be burning oil.

Additionally, if you had direct injection with computer control, wouldn't it be trivial to inject the fuel near a top-cylinder intake port *right before* the bottom-cylinder exhaust port closed so that the exhaust closed right before the fuel reached it, allowing for maximum fuel mixing without wasting any fuel?

Additionally, if you had variable intake valve mechanisms attached/enabling top-cylinder intake ports, wouldn't you be able to improve fuel mix across all conditions, and optimize air flow in all conditions? I am not even sure you would need valves for the bottom-cylinder exhaust ports. Maybe restrictor plates that didn't need to move with each cylinder rotation, they could be adjusted with hydraulics corresponding to engine rpm to change the airflow rate and effective timing of when the piston would close the port (shorter time if the restrictor plate is activated to whatever position).

2 stroke engines also achieve EGR without needing to tack on an EGR system.

Basically it seems to me that if you add the same mechanisms that are now commonly added to automotive engines, you solve all the fundamental disadvantages of the 2 stroke design, while not being any more complex (and possibly less complex) than the 4 strokes. And you still seem to be left with the fundamental 2 stroke advantage: it still has twice as many combustion strokes per rotation and should be capable of substantially higher power density than a 4 stroke.

After this, management brought up a guy from the shop-floor to take his seat - my understanding was that he was starting as Junior and that it would be my role to train him (despite him being at least 10 years older than me) - but no, he was made a fully fledged, fully paid, Engineer.   
Beyond that being a bit insulting (due to the years of training I did in comparison), I have tried my best to teach the guy the industry, but the guy is dangerous.

I've convinced management that it is a good idea for us to both to check each others work before it is submitted (as I'm not his superior, it had to be a two-way street) and I use this as a way of teaching him the job - things to look out for; the maths that he should be doing; and general rules of thumb. But, for the most part, he disregards everything I teach him because he feels he knows better - which really grinds my gears. Forever trying to be supportive in teaching him rather than being ""that guy"".

I've had lots of fallings out with him over what he calls ""petty"" and ""irrelevant"" topics - when actually I'm preventing him from potentially killing someone.  
I only manage to convince him when management get involved, and I have to explain Electrical Engineering codes of practice, standards, regulations and go through the maths line by line to Directors before he is told that he needs to do it... It's exhausting, and this happens frequently.

He's good with the logic, but doesn't care about the finer points of Electrical Engineering or the safety beyond the mechanical side of things - I've made my managers aware of my concerns and that he needs some training; I have shown them training courses that would be great for him and that wouldn't bust the bank, but he's the blue-eyed boy of the company and my concerns are dismissed.

The work load is atrociously slim, not enough for 1 engineer yet along 2 - so (in addition to the above), I want to leave, but if I do then he will be left as the only Engineer - and no one else at the company is electrically biased.

There will be no one left to monitor his work, and make sure it is safe - is it wrong of me to leave knowing that he may hurt someone some day?",AskEngineers,False,Dinoduck94,/r/AskEngineers/comments/j17jng/morality_help_electrical_engineering/
270,70,Starting over after a gap,1601273435,"This might not be the right place to post but giving it a shot.

My brother graduated with an Engineering degree (Mechanical). Right after graduation he was diagnosed with a mental illness. Because of it his self esteem took a HUGE hit. He never really looked for an engineering job because he thought no one would hire him and he was scared of the rejections etc. He has since been working low paying dead end jobs as a machine operator, factory worker, helper etc. Over the years he has slowly built up his confidence. He is now in his early 30s and after much therapy wants to start a fresh. 

Is it even possible for him to get back into engineering? How would he explain the dead end jobs? 

If not any programs/certifications that could help him get his foot into the field of engineering? He has done some robotics courses. He is willing to learn and has the aptitude for numbers and is a good problem solver.

I have a number of questions:

How is nominal size determined? I guess it would be defined by the aperture of a sieve? If so, I guess that means that a rock may be longer, but at least 2 dimensions need to be smaller than the nominal.

Are rocks that are larger (in 2 dimensions) considered unacceptable or is there a percentage (say 10%) that is normally accepted even though it's larger than nominal?

Are there standards (either international or Australian) that I can point to to say that these rocks are too much bigger than nominal?

How complicated would it be to actively cancel these vibrations? If you put a small box on the floor (maybe the size of a subwoofer), and inside that box you had a mechanism that could fling around a weight in however may axes was necessary, and there were also vibration sensors involved, and obviously control software, could that produce any positive effect? 

Would it need to be programmed to the specific geometries and properties of the floor system, or could an algorithm theoretically cancel some vibration when placed on any location on any floor?

Both positions are offering about the same salary, and about the same benefits, with Raytheon coming out slightly on top in both regards. Raytheon is based in Tucson AZ, while GM is based in Austin TX (I grew up and still live in TX). 

Originally I was going to take Raytheon since I went to school for Computer Engineering and like working close to the hardware, but I've heard bad things about working for a defense contractor. That how much work you have to do, and consequently how much you grow, REALLY depends on project placement. You can get lucky, and you can get unlucky. I would also have to wait 3-6 months for clearance to be placed on a meaningful project.

However, I've also heard a lot of mixed things about GM. Some say it's great for someone just starting out, and others say that rather than working on CS/CE work, you get pushed onto excel spreadsheets and the like. I also heard that once you're done with the new-grad portion (3yrs), the mid-level engineers get pushed aside and the company doesn't really care much anymore about you.

I'm the type that likes interesting and dynamic problems, and having something to do. My mind needs to be active. Legacy systems are a no-go.

1. Mask seals to the face, enclosing nose and mouth
2. One-way valve, open only when exhaling
3. Exhaled air passes through a water reservoir, with a material barrier submerged well below the water surface, such that all air is forced through it
4. Water reservoir made of or coated with anti-microbial material
5. Air, once on the water's surface, exits the reservoir via pressure from the next breath exhaled, rejoining open outside air
6. One-way valve, open to the outside air, with a filter in place, open only when inhaling

I'm not sure what materials are best suited for each part. The reservoir could be small, like the size of one of those [CO₂ cartridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlet) for paintball.

I need to select 2 DC motors to rotate the rear wheels on a four-wheel robot that will move on grass. I'm trying to dummy check my math and make sure I don't select the wrong ones. Specifically I'm struggling with calculating the torque I need.

My weight estimation is 88 lbf, so each motor will push 44 lbf of that.  
Rolling resistance is F = cW, where c is the coefficient of rolling resistance. The closest values for c I've found are 0.04-0.08 for car tires on medium hard soil. So F = 0.08\*44lbf = 3.52 lbf.

The rear tires have a radius of 5 inches, so T = rF = (5/12)\*(3.52) = 1.467 ft-lbf or approximately 281.6 oz-in.

This seems low to me but I can't figure out if I'm approaching the problem in the wrong way. I assume that this value would be my stall torque.

I have spent the past few weeks reading up on methods used in structural health monitoring, such as optical fibre sensors, particle image velocimetry, vibrating wire gauges, and even the embedment of magnetic microwires into the concrete, but they don't meet the criteria that my professor has set out for me.

314,14,An important topic that I could really use some insight from other Engineers: Managing your EGO,1601216850,"Background, EE major, worked in the aerospace industry for 15 years and after that, started my own e-commerce business which has been successful and allowed me to live internationally while having a team supporting the business. I’m 39. I read a lot of philosophy, history, politics and generally, try to understand the world more as well as listen to various science and philosophy podcasts like Sam Harris (not for politics but for approaches on how to think, hope I don’t get flamed for his political leanings as that’s not why I listen to him).

I’m reaching out here because I feel engineers are the closest group of people that can understand some of the plights I have been struggling with. To be fair, even within engineering in the various companies I’ve worked for in the aerospace industry, there’s a lot of incompetency but the smartest, most logical thinking people I have ever met, are always Engineers (I understand some of this perception might be skewed by the fact I just generally meet more engineers). Having been out of the industry for 6-7 years now, I am missing the wise words of more senior engineers who really used to provide me life advice and mentor me in ways of thinking.

The issue (I apologize in advance for what must sound egoistic as I didn’t want to take too much time choosing every single word to soften my statement) 

For the last 20 years, I have really honed my thinking in an attempt to be highly objective, logically, fact based, understanding the source, considering multiple variables in a given system or scenario, removing bias, playing things out to its logical conclusion if I take certain actions, understanding unknowns, managing risk, etc when thinking about any single topic in life. This is generally what good engineers always try to do in order to get better at what we do. After 20 years of doing that, it has served me very well as I generally always understand what is happening accurately in a given situation in life as well as it has led me to successfully start a business  but as you get better and better at that, I feel more and more isolated in that, so much of what I hear from everyone around me (opinions, etc from friends/family), is quite frankly, just low level, surface thinking. To be blunt, 99% of opinions I hear are “dumb”. Over the years, I generally try to bite my tongue and not give my opinion as most of the times, when I do share my opinion and really break down the logic of everything, most people can’t even seem to comprehend, consider or visualize more than 1-2 variables for instance. And what would sometimes happen is they would feel the need to blindly defend their position at times. But generally, if the people are of somewhat average competency, they would not be able to really even appreciate some conversational depth. It almost always leads no where. So I think generally, it’s best to bite my tongue and don’t share my opinions given the level of competency of the average crowd.


Does anybody else feel the same? As in feeling so many people around them are “incompetent” and feeling isolated? How do you guys manage it? Any insight from some of the more senior engineers? What do you guys do or would you advice? How do I stop feeling like I’m living on an island by myself. I miss kicking the shit with my fellow engineers at office as everything was so congruent as we mostly all thought so logical.  As they say, sometimes, ignorance is bliss and “simpler/not smart people have happier lives”. 

Additional insight as it might add more color to my issue: I was born in Asia, went to school in Madison, WI, worked in corporate America for 15 years, and moved to Thailand (I’m not Thai) 3 years ago. Although I still had this issue in America, it’s definitely more pronounced in Asia with the lack of logical thinking as that’s not something really championed here. Have not met many engineers here socially.

I was called in for an interview this upcoming week, and I was notified yesterday that the role is actually under my old boss.

A bit of backstory... I've been with this company for about 2 years, I'm a mechanical engineer, and got hired in as a test engineer. It's a well known defense contractor. My current base salary is $98.5K, and with bonuses, benefits, tuition reimbursement, and OT, I will be breaking $130K total comp for this year. I also get a % of the student loan payments I make, go into my 401K. I've only been 6 years out of school with a bachelors only, and I'm about to start an MBA program, paid for by my employer also.

In my  old department I was asked to take a leadership role, only 6 months after I had started, no pay increase, just stepping up for a chance to prove myself. And then, a whole bunch of drama ensued throughout the year (2019), mostly because my leadership team was detached, it was my first leadership role, and I had an underperforming engineer who tried to ruin my reputation and the managers did not address my concerns. Eventually I was asked to find ways to not overspend the program, and I said the remaining work could be performed by a smaller team.

I found the kid another assignment, but I was also disappointed with the lack of leadership and support in that department and I reached out to my network and took a lateral move at the end of the project, in a more finance/project management role. I didn't burn any bridges, and I told my boss that I wouldn't mind working under her again, just not in that department. She's a really nice person, I just didn't want to work for her. I feel that if I had met her long ago, we would have been friends, we have a lot of stuff in common. She saw me struggle, she also saw me really pissed, and  she stood up for me when the underperforming engineer played the victim and wanted to take me to HR. 

She saw me make it out the other side, with an increased understanding on how to deal with politics and BS, and still complete the project. 

I started my current job in January 2020...then COVID happened. I've been working from home since March, we were told we won't be going back to the office this year. My role has been great, I get a lot of visibility, opportunities to show case my skills and even find myself with downtime every month, which I've used to document reporting processes and learn advanced Excel and Power BI and Data Analytics to make my reports pretty and accurate.  I don't want to leave my group, I've gotten really good mentorship here. The thing is, that my role as a project engineer, due to someone's ""organizational effectiveness"" initiatives, is now under the finance organization. The pay ranges are also different, basically lower. With a technical job code, my salary range at my current level is $72K-135K, but the same grade in for a non technical job code, is $51K to $112K.

I started applying for jobs internally. There was this really cool job as a deputy program manager, and I have 90% of the skills they're asking for, so I applied. The median base pay for that role is $120K-$130K, and it caps outs at $160K, it will also be a promotion for me, though I am on track to be promoted anyway at the end of this year,  I just don't want to be in the finance organization. They called me for the interview, and I accepted. Today I found out that it's gonna be under my old dept manager, and right now...I don't feel ready to go back and work for her again. She knows me a little too well, and that scares me.

I'm looking for advice, I was considering cancelling the application and interview, but then…as a deputy program manager, I would be promoted into a technical job grade, out of finance, better base pay and travel internationally, and guaranteed mentorship because I would be the lead engineer/program manager's deputy.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks

I have written a rather massive article in the hopes of teaching people with mid-level knowledge in electronics about the idea of Duals in mathematics, how that applies to circuits and the various types of circuit duals that exist

I also include a great deal of detail in the end about one very obscure and rarely studied circuit dual called the magnetic circuit dual, it is a circuit, like a magnetic circuit, but instead of current being the flow of electrons, it is the flow of a magnetic field through wires made of iron instead of copper.

I even touch on briefly how one can extract energy from permanent magnets and other details most people arent very familiar with.

The problem is the article is massive and I really could use some eyes on it. Whether its just to try to help me catch english mistakes, or if your not that experienced perhaps tell me the parts that are confusing, as I would like this to be accessible to people who may not be scientists and only know entry level electronics or science. any feedback from anyone at any level would be highly appreciated.

Keep in mind I couldn't find many good sources laying out the equations for magnetic circuits very clearly so I had to derive a lot of the equations myself, though the concept is well established as fact and many peer-reviewed papers have been written on it. But bear in mind there may be minor errors in my math as well, so that too needs some criticism, though the math should be fairly close to correct.

Anyway any input from anyone would be much appreciated.

332,32,Project Management and You! Some resources to help people think about systems and their role in it,1601166258,"**What is a Project Manager?** 

A project manager in an engineering environment is an individual usually in charge of a small group of people developing some technical system for a larger organization. They are responsible for their own technical goals, but also to some extent engineering the team that engineers. 

**The basic duties of the project manager** 

* Serve as the interface between stakeholders and the team 
* Engineer the team links (between members of the team) to ensure success 
* Develop the team such that they can handle changes to stakeholder needs 
* Keep themselves and the team accountable to the larger organization's standards (conduct, paperwork, etc.) 
* Set goals and help the team provide the necessary deliverables 

**The Iron Triangle** 

Why does the project manager do all of this? Cost, Scope and Schedule. The minute a project is committed to paper, the Iron Triangle is set. Unless some amazing breakthrough happens (i.e. your future self comes back to give you the technology), you have a budget in cost, scope and schedule that is cast. As development happens, the project manager needs to make trades between cost, scope, and schedule to deliver the system. Some things will let you meet scope (what the system needs to do), but come at the cost of....cost. In other situations, you can cut scope and gain some more money budget  (cost) and some more time budget (schedule). The project manager needs to be the engineer in charge of making these high level trades. 

**Managing Scope** 

Many engineering projects in the undergraduate and even graduate domain have clearly defined scopes with clearly defined deliverables. This is not true in real life. Ask a lot of questions of your stakeholder and document their needs. Every major requirement should be worded as the object "".... shall do...."" something. Functional requirements are something the thing should do, performance requirements are things you can measure to make sure it does what you want it to do. Developing a Concept of Operations, or a narrative of how the thing should work is super helpful. 

Every project should have a list of functional and performance requirements as well as ways to validate these measurements. If development happens and something needs to change, talk to the stakeholders. 

Furthermore, if you're in a team that needs to negotiate with another team, you should make an Interface Control Document. Here is an awesome one for cubesats. [http://nanoracks.com/wp-content/uploads/Current\_edition\_of\_Interface\_Document\_for\_NanoRacks\_Internal\_Platforms\_1A\_2A\_NanoLab\_Modules.pdf](http://nanoracks.com/wp-content/uploads/Current_edition_of_Interface_Document_for_NanoRacks_Internal_Platforms_1A_2A_NanoLab_Modules.pdf) Here is another awesome one for a rocket!

**Managing Cost** 

Depends on the organization. Try to aim to always have 20% allocated for manager's margin just in case! 

**Managing Schedule** 

This is usually done through a Systems Engineering Management Plan. You should set up Design Reviews regularly (once a month typically or at least four times through the development process). Check your work against your scoping documents and requirements. 

Furthermore, determine a rough list of tasks and their dependencies. From this, make a swimlane chart or a gantt chart to understand what your schedule is and how you must progress/what problems you might encounter. A design structure matrix might also help! 

Also determine what kind of organization or schedule do you need. Do you need waterfall development, where you make big steps every once and a while or do you need continually improving and working prototypes (spiral development or Agile development). Make sure your team structures and schedules match. 

**Putting it all together**

This is literally your job. Help your team make goals and schedules to meet your scope goals. Check the cost, schedule, and scope, and make choices to balance out development. Keep your team incentivized and engaged and issue Personal Improvement Plans if necessary with the help of HR or whatever. 

Ironically, there aren't any definitive resources about how to do this super easily. No design project is the same and the study of the field has only existed for one hundred years, and systems engineering even less.

I’m looking for some advice about whether or not I should accept a return offer from the company I last interned at. This upcoming summer will be the last summer before I graduate in December 2021, and I’ve been under the impression it’s important to get an internship with a company that you really want to work for during that last summer. I currently have a return offer from a major appliance company but I’m really not interested in working for them long-term, and I didn’t love living in the city where it’s headquartered. That said, I did really enjoy the internship and I learned a lot. With everything going on with COVID, I’m nervous that I won’t find anything in the field I’m interested in (Biomedical/Med devices), and I’ll end up with nothing if I don’t take the offer I have. I would also be happy with an internship in any other field; ideally, I just want to learn new things and experience a different company while I can. 

I already tried to get the offer deadline extended, and I was able to add 3 days to the original 1 week deadline, but that still only leaves me until Tuesday to decide.

338,38,Tips for a future Electrical engineer interested to work in the aerospace industry.,1601159410,"Hello everyone :)

I'm asking this here because I want a real opinion from people that have experience or can give good advice.

I'm a second-year Electrical engineer student, I always loved to think about what might the future bring us from an aerospace point of view, I'm very enthusiastic about SpaceX and Blue Origin work and about exploring Outerspace. And I'm looking for directions and advice on what kind of work or disciplines  Electrical engineers take in the aerospace industry.

And second what kind of farther education or experience outside of the academy should I try to gain in order to build my path to be a better engineer relative to the above. It could be advice on some topics I should look into, some courses I should take, or recommendations on some software that I should learn that most engineers use in there work.

 I know that this is a very general thing to ask but I'm open-minded and looking to learn new things.

I thought that might be useful to add that I did some small Arduino projects. I have some programming knowledge in C C++. And my last project was a teensy 4.0  flight controller for a quadcopter programmed in VScode.

393,93,Aerospike nozzle contour design issues - Please help!,1601087493,"Hello all,

I am a mechanical engineer who is attempting to design a bipropellant rocket engine.

For various reasons, I have chosen to implement an aerospike nozzle. As such, I used method of characteristics and created an Excel spreadsheet to plot the nozzle contour. What I've encountered are some issues with the resulting geometry. I've stared and played around with this for a long time, and can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

So basically, this is what I'm getting. Referencing the attached spreadsheet:

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-58ZZk9aJWHRs9ePnQ-oARIZb2Uvpda/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-58ZZk9aJWHRs9ePnQ-oARIZb2Uvpda/view?usp=sharing)

\-The functions I've written for Фx, re, θt, νx, &amp; x are correct (fingers crossed). I say this because when I input 2.5 for rx (column K) in the very first row, the x value for the throat is -0.9315"" (where the zero datum is the cowl lip). This is also what we get from the equation Δx = (re-rt)\*tan(θt) = (3.11083-2.5)\*tan(56.7452deg) \[in\] = 0.9315 \[in\].

What seems to be messed up is my radius function (column K). At the throat, the radius \*should\* be 2.5"", but the function yields 2.93235"". Additionally, the radius never converges to a point (r = 0) at the exit Mach number.

Please note that I'm not specifically and aerospace engineer by trade; just learning some principles from books and research papers.

I would be very appreciative if someone could take a look at my spreadsheet and see if I missed something. I am well aware that I could easily calculate my nozzle contours using software ([http://www.aerorocket.com/MOC/MOC.html](http://www.aerorocket.com/MOC/MOC.html)), but that's not how I like to do my engineering. I want to make sure I get a thorough grasp on what I'm doing instead of plug and chug.

I should note that this design process is for my own educational benefit. This is not a pie-in-the-sky idea to actually build one (at least not in the foreseeable future), as we all know those pitfalls...

I will be glad to clarify anything if you feel my post isn't clear.

Another safety mechanism of the drive motor doesn’t allow the motor to shut off until it reaches a certain temp so that when it gets turned back on; there will be ample room for the temperature spike in the windings due to the surge in current at start up. However if the ambient temp that the compressor exists in is always high, than this prevents the compressor from shutting off completely in unload mode; and thus the low pressure caused by unloading, forces the compressor to go to load mode.

412,12,Choosing a Course at Oxford University,1601067077,"Hello, I’m looking for a bit of career advice. Any help would be much appreciated!

(I’m probably wrong in a lot of my opinions too! As I am pretty much just a high school teenager with little life/work experience)

**So, I’m in year 13 in the UK (equivalent in US is high school senior?) and I’m applying to study physics at most universities. However, I’m applying to Oxford University (or Cambridge, maybe) and I’m torn between two courses, physics and engineering science.** 

Some background: I don’t know if there’s a pleasant way to say it but I’m quite academically gifted (or hard working – take your pick). All 9s/A\* at GCSE and in my recent mocks all A\* in Physics, Maths, Further Maths and Chemistry, which are my predicted grades. For a lot of secondary school and primary school I was also bored in classes because they went slowly for me. And in an ideal world, I’d like to be able to have a job that’s intellectually challenging among other things.

In practicality, I think that means I don’t really like “stagnant” jobs where you do a very small set of tasks, and I’d prefer ones when the problems to be solve/situations vary or at least new challenges come up. So in a task, if I feel like I’ve “solved” how to do a certain task optimally, I guess I feel like I’m just an advanced input-output mapping machine, and I don’t really want to become that. 

So, talking about physics. I’ve done quite a lot of research into studying it I’d say, and I do enjoy it, and I definitely think \*studying\* physics will be the right sort of “intellectually challenging” for me. However, I don’t really see myself in academia and I don’t think there’s anywhere else that will pay you to study “physics for the sake of physics”-especially because I guess that doesn’t tend as much to apply to real world results. 

(Even if I liked academia’s environment, I wouldn’t be sure about it because the nature of science research seems very “unpredictable” in what will be a fruitful endeavor. And I want to have a job that “actually” has a good impact on the world. I don’t want to spend my life toiling away for little (subjective)reward, though furthering human knowledge is a very noble mission.)

**I also am applying to study Physics at most unis (we choose 5 in the UK), because I don’t really want to be an average engineer as I don’t think I’d enjoy the work.** Speaking honestly, I don’t think it would interest me a lot as \*cue oversimplification\* it seems that engineering is about knowing your sets of rules really well, and how to work within them. However, once you know the rules well there’s not really much more to do.

In this case I guess physics would be the study of “creating” these rules/physical laws, playing with them/testing them. But I don’t really want to do that because physics research seems hyper specialized. And I don’t think mayybe stumbling on the discovery that stuff may or may not happen with cold Rydberg atoms in a vacuum at exactly -271 degrees, would be very satisfying to me. (I’m not sure how much I agree with this though)

**That is to say, I most likely see myself working somewhere between engineering and physics. I want to apply the rules to get real life results, but also have a very good knowledge of the rules and how to manipulate them, maybe to create better ways of applying these rules or something like that. I kind of see myself being an applied physicist, or a “theoretical” engineer.**

**This kind of seems like what the “Engineering Science” course is about?**

Like if Quantum computers (QC) were being worked on, I wouldn’t be the person who discovered a new thingamabob that might lead to maintaining coherence better in theory. I want to be the person who gets the theoretical idea and turns it into something that works. 

Later down the line of practicality, what I don’t want is maybe something like making computers for the mass market and looking at optimizing the cooling of a CPU. (That actually sounds somewhat interesting, but) I don’t think I want to be that level of “practical” as an engineer. And if it was just going through methods of cooling and applying them slightly differently, it would lose many more interest points for me. I hope this makes sense.

**So overall, if I want to become this “theoretical engineer”, is it better to go at it from the engineering perspective and become more theoretical, or from physics and then apply it?**

Aka, With these two courses:  [engineering science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/engineering-science) and [physics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/physics)

Which one would be best?

And maybe if I do realize “theoretical engineering” isn’t for me, which would do you think would be the best choice?

As most of us know, ink printers are sold at a loss and ink is a scam. My printer has been out of ink for some time now and it would cost about $200 to buy replacement ink. Lmao no thanks on that one. But it got me thinking, I use pens every day and those have ink in them so why can't I just make a printer that drags a pen around a page and print things that way? 

Unfortunately, I have no idea where to start. The initial idea was to build something similar to a Fused Deposition Modeling machine that hovers a pen above a workspace (in this case the page) but I'm not sure if that's a viable option because I'm just a college student and I lack experience when it comes to projects that are this complex. 

General Doubts: Is this project worth the time? I could say it's a good project to get my feet wet but I know nothing about computer science so the programming will take a lot for me. Will the printer turn out to be cumbersome or failure-prone? I don't exactly trust in my ability to build a perfectly-functional printer with the little experience I have. Will the printer cost a lot to make and if so, will it last a long time and save me money in the long term?

It seems like it would be easy to stamp out long parallel Tesla valves as a densely packed textured surface. When exposed to liquid, it seems like such a thing would have very strange  properties...especially as the texture size decreases and is vibrated.

Examples:

Olympic swim suits mimic shark skin with textures that counter-intuitively increase drag...and by some weirdness they work better that way. It seems like a 'Tesla valve texture' used in the non-favored direction (resisting head to toe flow) would do a great job of this...but this time, only in one direction. Would such a texture actually work like this? 

If you put this texture on the wall of a shower favoring the upward direction, the chaotic motion of water and air would work to drive water up the wall of the shower to an extent and create a 'clinging' effect by harvesting a portion of the energy to drive water upward.

I'm looking for some advice on how to proper size a 3-phase transformer (ie power rating).   


Here's my setup:

\- I'm using a 3ph 480V (primary) to 240 (secondary) delta-delta transformer  as a way to sink power into the grid.   
\- The ""loads"" connected to the 240 secondary are SINGLE phase devices (240V L-1), each outputting 8kW  
\- I have 24 devices in total that I want to connect to the transformer but I will be evenly distributing the units across all three phases (ie 8 units connected L1-L2, 8 units L1-L3 and 8 units L2-L3).   


How do I calculate the required power rating for my transformer?   
Is it simply kVA = (8kW \* 240V \* sqrt(3)) \* 24 = \~320kVA

480,80,Engineering company's decision for 2021/post-COVID office,1600963681,"I've posted this in r/jobs as well but wanted to see what my fellow engineers think:

My company yesterday sent an email about the plans for 2021 post-COVID returning to work/office plans (this was from corporate, the big wigs in different office than my own). Since March, we have been working from home for the most part (some employees going in 1-2 days a week as of recent months) and have been maintaining our 9/80 schedule (9 hours a day for every other Friday off). This email's TL;DR is ""We know you want to know what we're doing next, if your position is eligible, you may CHOOSE to work from home up to 3 days a week come 2021 but we are also removing the 9/80 schedule, you will now work 5 days a week for 40 hours"".

It has been a very lukewarm response so far from my coworkers. I'm contemplating reaching out to my boss within my office to say well... why is this the decided option? We've literally been working from home almost 4-5 days a week for the last 6 months, still on the 9/80 schedule and we have not been less productive. Why is removing this big benefit of 9/80 scheduling the ""solution"" to allowing some working from home allowance permanently? How are they related? I honestly have been getting tired of working from home (getting lonely, no routine, less active, etc) and arguably would not want to work from home 3 days a week. But if that 9/80 schedule is removed (a day that was for ""me time"", appointments, etc), I mean... what was the point? Is it fair to bring up these concerns?

500,0,English name for the device,1600936489,"Hi all, fellow mechanical engineer here. English is my second language, and usually I have no problem translating the terms from Croatian to English and vice versa. But I'm stumped by the device we call ""hidrofor"" which google translates to ""hydrophore"". After googling that term I can't seem to find what I'm looking for. 

The device is composed of a pump and an expasion tank, prefilled with compressed air, and a pressure sensor of some sort. The tank holds pressure between two set points, and pump is occasionally turned on/off (on at lower set point, off at upper set point). Usually it's used at homes that have a well or a water tank, to pull and pressurise the water for the house where classical water distribution network is absent (mostly rural areas). 

Thank you 😁",AskEngineers,False,DeeN56595,/r/AskEngineers/comments/iytfn0/english_name_for_the_device/
501,1,Engineers are people too! Optimize Life outside of code,1600933212," 

## [Optimizing Life](https://algodaily.com/lessons/to-make-progress-start-by-breaking-it-up)

There's a few computer science principles that can be surprisingly applied to general life. As an example, the notion of greedy algorithms. One can liken the idea of optimal choice at every iteration to trying your best daily so that it works out over the long term -- seems reasonable.

Another one is the idea of instructions, that is, single operations for the processor. Code in aggregate is difficult to comprehend, but when taken line by line, make for a narrative of sorts. The key is that the big concepts are broken down as much as possible, to the point where the processor can accomplish a single task.

This works outside of computer science too. The notion of building a great career over 40 years can be intimidating, but can also be broken down: are you improving technically? Are you taking on harder tasks? Do you demonstrate enthusiasm?",AskEngineers,False,jahapiv,/r/AskEngineers/comments/iysta7/engineers_are_people_too_optimize_life_outside_of/
502,2,What's the best way to become self taught.,1600930756,"It's the information age, and I feel for most subjects it's easier to learn online for free then to go to a university. Right now I'm going through Khan Academy's math courses, and they have stuff like multivariable calculus and linear algebra and a bunch of other stuff. I'm pretty confident I can learn just about any field of math or science from internet resources alone.

But I think with hands-on stuff, when it comes to designing and building new technology, I'm not confident that I can learn those things from my computer. So how can I make sure that I can really get a firm grasp on the hands-on part.

However, I had some intern experience, and some balls. So I left the job with no safety net. Nothing in my savings. Cold turkey. The PE next to me at my job would harass me all day about every little micro mistake I made. I left so fast. I was free, but jobless, and at what cost?

She has 3 years experience mostly working for Vinci Construction, 1.5 yrs in the quality and safety departments and 1.5 yrs in the project management department.

She's trying to figure out what the best investment of her time would be for her career right now. Her main interest is in Project Management/Budgeting. We've been looking into some certificates offered by [SDSU](https://ces.sdsu.edu/construction/professional-certificate-construction-project-management), [ASCE](https://www.asce.org/continuing-education/construction-engineering-certificate-program/), and [PMI](https://www.pmi.org/certifications). In all honesty, I'm a finance/CS guy and she's not from the US, we are entirely out of our depth here. No idea what the best course of action as far as career progression and actually landing a job is here.

My undergraduate school was small and didn't really have an engineering program so I don't know much. I'm considering many master's programs, mostly those in energy systems engineering.

1) Tufts has a MS in Offshore Wind Energy Engineering. Is this too specific for it to make sense to get a master's degree in? It seems to be a booming industry and it really interests me so I think I'd like the program, just wanted to get some advice as to whether it's too niche.

2) On the other hand, would it be smarter for me to look into programs like Energy Systems Engineering? I definitely want to focus on energy but this could help expose me to more ideas. 

I've also looked into doing mechanical engineering because it's the ""jack of all trades"" and certainly could apply to energy. I'm looking for programs that would allow for a concentration in energy. I just worry that that would be too broad and that I should focus on energy in my program if that's what I want to do.

I keep in contact with them once or twice a month, and while they still want to hire me, they need to wait for more projects to come in before they can justify bringing on new people. I don't want to risk my entire career banking on the fact that I might get this position so I keep applying to jobs dilligently.

As for interships, I worked for the government for one year total while in school, but the position was more of a technologist role rather than anything to do with design. I was recently rejected for an engineering position with them and all their technologist jobs have already been filled.

I am applying to entry level engineering positions as well as technician/technologist roles. For engineering positions, its difficult for me to even get an interview, while the technician roles are turning me down because they don't want someone with a degree. I also look for technical sales and IT positions which hasn't lead to anything so far.

What would the best course of action be for someone in my position? I'm mostly applying through various job boards and contacting old employers. Are there any skills I should try to work on right now, or other places to look?

It's abundantly clear to me I have no chance of standing out from anyone applying for these jobs. Graduated Dec 2019 BSME. I can't even get hired a fucking factory job doing technician work. I'm stuck in this stupid retail job. No internships or industry experience at all. 

What can I do to become a stronger candidate for engineering jobs? I'm studying Japanese to try to attain N5 fluency. I've done quite a bit the last few months studying Japanese and I think I'm fairly close to completing all the stuff I need to learn in the next 2 or so months. I'm also trying to study for the patent bar I'm trying to take by the end of Dec (though I'll probably have to put the testing date off for a bit longer). Lastly, I'm trying to figure what parts I need to build a CAD/programming workstation on a budget (using planning on using Solidworks, OnShape and Fusion 360), also including a build-it-yourself 3D printer in the budget also (looking for suggestions on those, I saw a $250 printer a while ago but forgot the name). I haven't put any CAD work in my resume at all because I've literally done none. I have knowledge of how the programs work, but not any professional or hobby work.
 
Here's what I want to do:

* I want to specialize in patent law down the road (definitely as a patent examiner), but if not, I'd like to switch over to computer science.
* PLC programming is definitely in my near future 100%, after I complete the patent bar.
* Programming is definitely the next focus for me.
* I don't know if I should try to get the FE certification. I'm thinking of going to graduate school for computer engineering or computer science, but it's not in the cards whatsoever because I have no money.
* I also want to immigrate to Canada or somewhere that's not US within the next 7 years or so (ideally within 5). I'm kind of stuck here with my home under my name at the moment.

What can I do to strengthen my chances in those aspects?

568,68,I'm a BSMET who feels lost. What can I do?,1600869976,"Greetings all. I'm a new user to reddit but have scoured it for literal YEARS. Anyway, I'm a Mechanical Engineering Technologist who graduated December of 2019. 

Right now I'm working as a contractor Field Engineer/Controls Tech for an electric company. I work primarily in data centers and am usually at construction sites majority of my time. I been at this job going on 8 months and am currently looking for new work because I feel this kind of work doesn't reflect anything I did in school. Not to mention, the pay is kind of crappy and tbh, even though I like the hands on stuff, I enjoy the behind the desk stuff as well, I'm almost 80% hands on and just don't enjoy being on a construction site for most of my time.. 

I've struggled to land something and I'm convinced it's for 1 of 3 reasons (or maybe all of them) 1. I'm not an actual engineer and a lot of the jobs I apply to only look for people with a BSME 2. My resume is scrapped by computers before it even reaches somebody. Perhaps I'm not tailoring it very well, or my resume is not the most impressive. I didn't truly have actual internships when I was in college so I feel that played a role. Or 3. I don't have connections really to these jobs. I see BSME grads themselves on here through the years struggle to break in the field due to not knowing many people on the inside.. I know it's not a foolproof solution to me finding something in the field, but it wouldn't hurt to have those connections. 

So I just want to know from my fellow METs and even hear from some actual engineers, what's some advice? Or better yet, what job descriptions should I be looking for? Maybe I should be looking more towards test engineering/design engineering rather than mechancial engineering? Most jobs I found either I can't qualify for (require a BSE) or I have way more than what's required (jobs that I qualify for seem to be mostly be jobs that only require a HS diploma) I've had classmates with the same degree whom I was pretty cool with in college who work now as Systems Engineers, Manufacturing Engineers, Quality engineers, and Mechanical Design Engineers for places like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. one guy I had classes with landed a full on Mechanical engineering job upon graduating at a pretty decent sized company. So I feel it's not necessarily my degree holding me back, it's myself. It's me not knowing the right people, and not using my connections efficiently to find these right people. 

For a little more background, I live in the Northern Virginia area so there are a lot of government contracted jobs out here but they seem to be pretty dead set on having an actual engineering degree (which I can understand). In addition, I'm not looking to leave my area just yet. Nearby cities sure but I'm still looking to pay off my student loan within the next year or so.

0.999...

""the 9s dont stop""

thus

0.999.. is an infinite decimal non-integer

just like

0.888... the 8s dont stop thus is an infinite decimal non-integer

0.777... the 7s dont stop thus is an infinite decimal non-integer

0.666... the 6s dont stop thus is an infinite decimal non-integer

so when

1=0.999...

that means

[integer]1=0.999...[you say the 9s dont stop-] thus an infinite decimal non-integer

we have a contradiction

or again

when maths proves 1=0.999...

thus

Let be x = 0.999.. [the notation means 0.999.. you admit ""The 9's never stop"" thus is an infinite decimal is a non-integer]

10x = 9.999...

10x-x =9.999...- 0.999...

9x=9

x= 1 [the notation mean 1 is a whole number an integer]

1= 0.999...

it is proven an integer (1) = a non-integer (0.999...) [you admit ""The 9's never stop""thus a infinite decimal thus non-integer] maths ends in contradiction

mathematics is irrational inconsistent ends in meaninglessness 6 proofs

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/MATHEMATICS.pdf

proof 4

A 1 unit by 1 unit triangle is a contradiction in terms-the length of the hypotenuse is root 2. Ie non-finite which does not terminate ie can never be constructed- thus the triangle can never be constructed Thus a contradiction in terms Thus mathematics ends in meaninglessness

if the root 2 diagonal stops that means root 2 stops-which is not the mathematical case

and

you end in contradiction

you admit that root 2 is an irrational number

you admitt an irrational numbers is

An irrational number has endless non-repeating digits to the right of the decimal point.

https://www.factmonster.com/math-science/mathematics/rational-and-irrational-numbers

if you you say root 2 stops

contradiction dude

ie root 2 never stops but it stops

thus supporting again Magister colin leslie deans view that ""all products of human thought end in meaninglessness""

This again shows that mathematics/geometry/trigonometry cant be the language of the universe as the objects mathematics creates ie a 1 by 1 root 2 triangle cannot exist in our universe

Godels theorems end in meaninglessness

Science Magazine says ""Kurt Gödel—Separating Truth from Proof in Mathematics

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/298/5600/1899.full.pdf

Wikipedia says

It is said of"" Gödel's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that demonstrate the ... Many logicians believe that Gödel's incompleteness theorems struck a fatal blow to David .. The Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems

but to your shock- Godels theorems end in meaninglessness and cant have been a Mathematical Breakthrough

Magister colin leslie dean the only modern Renaissance man with 9 degrees including 4 masters: B,Sc, BA, B.Litt(Hons), MA, B.Litt(Hons), MA, MA (Psychoanalytic studies), Master of Psychoanalytic studies, Grad Cert (Literary studies) :

He is also Australia's leading erotic poet

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/book-genre/poetry/

shows Godels 1st and 2nd theorems shown to end in meaninglessness

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/GODEL5.pdf

Godels 1st theorem

“Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In particular, for any consistent, effectively generated formal theorythat proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true,[1] but not provable in the theory (Kleene 1967, p. 250)

but Godel cant tell us what makes a mathematical statement true,

thus his theorem is meaningless and the Science Magazine claim is nonsense meaningless

even Cambridge expert on Godel Peter Smith admits

""Gödel didn't rely on the notion of truth""

thus by not telling us what makes a maths statement true Godels 1st theorem is meaningless

so that shows the ""Science Magazine"" claim:""Kurt Gödel—Separating Truth from Proof in Mathematics"" is nonsense as Godel cant tell us what truth is and there cant have been a ""Mathematical Breakthrough""

and for some relish

Godel uses his G statement to prove his theorem but Godels sentence G is outlawed by the very axiom of the system he uses to prove his theorem ie the axiom of reducibility -thus his proof is invalid,

Godels 2nd theorem

Godels second theorem ends in paradox– impredicative

The theorem in a rephrasing reads http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Proof_sketch_for_the_second_theorem

The following rephrasing of the second theorem is even more unsettling to the foundations of mathematics: If an axiomatic system can be proven to be consistent and complete from within itself, then it is inconsistent.”

or again

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems

""The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.""

But here is a contradiction Godel must prove that a system c a n n o t b e proven to be consistent based upon the premise that the logic he uses must be consistent . If the logic he uses is not consistent then he cannot make a proof that is consistent. So he must assume that his logic is consistent so he can make a proof of the impossibility of proving a system to be consistent. But if his proof is true then he has proved that the logic he uses to make the proof must be consistent, but his proof proves that this cannot be done

note if Godels system is inconsistent then it can demonstrate its consistency and inconsistency

but Godels theorem does not say that

it says

""...the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency""

thus as said above

""But here is a contradiction Godel must prove that a system c a n n o t b e proven to be consistent based upon the premise that the logic he uses must be consistent""

But if his proof is true then he has proved that the logic he uses to make the proof must be consistent, but his proof proves that this cannot be done

My goal is to work flight side - specifically to put something on the Moon or in space that I worked on directly not just tested.

After a conversation with a friend who was 26 and had a fully finished degree from the same program at the same school, he explained to me that I should switch to mechanical engineering. He said that after 2.5 years on the job, it wasn't feasable anymore to continue a degree in petroleum engineering. If I were to stay at ULL and transfer to mechanical engineering, I would be behind about a semester. So, my options are to transfer to either LSU or Texas AM which both have pros and cons. If I were to go to LSU, I can continue to either pursue a petroleum engineering degree as well as a minor in mechanical engineering. My main concern is if a minor in mechanical engineering would be useful if I needed to leave the oil industry later on, and would a minor in mechanical engineering be considered at a higher standard if I was a graduated engineer in another discipline. Here are my pros and cons of each:

1. Stay at ULL and transfer to meche eng
   1. Pros
      1. Saves money
      2. Can finish pete eng degree if I wanted to
   2. Cons
      1. Will be behind a semester if I transfered to meche eng
      2. A pete eng degree my not be feasable in the future to hold a job.
2. Transfer to LSU
   1. Pros
      1. Can study pete eng as a major then study meche eng as a minor
      2. Keeps scholarships because I stay in state
      3. Possibly better networking at LSU 
      4. Pete eng credits at ULL fully transfer to LSU
   2. Cons
      1. Cost slightly more than ULL by a few grand a year.
      2. Studying for a meche minor will delay my graduation by about a year unless I take 2 summers of classes.
3. Transfer to Texas AM
   1. Pros
      1. Much better meche eng program (ranked 10-13 depending on source)
      2. Can study meche eng major then get a minor in pete eng. 
   2. Cons
      1. Significantly costs more as I would no longer be eligible for my scholarships and would have to pay for out of state tuition.
      2. Lose alot of credits since LA credits may not apply to TX univeristy credits.

I started my career almost two years ago in a multinational company that manufactures industrial equipment. I work at the Research and Product Development Department. I have learned a lot in my job up to now and it seems that my boss believes in my potential. Every day is a new lesson and I still have a lot to learn (really, a lot!). Lately, my responsibilities have been scaling up and today the company Product Portfolio Committee has approved two new product line developments, in which I have been assigned to be the technical coordinator. One project involves some innovation and new product design, the other one is more like an adaptation of a product line for a specific market (Russia).

&amp;#x200B;

These two projects add up to some of the responsibilities I already hold. I am coordinating another product line development which I took over at the end of 2019 when the former coordinator moved to another country. I also coordinate a small structural analysis team (2 other engineers and an intern) and a team that develops FEA tools (2 engineers), both of these leadership roles were also assigned to me at the end of 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm quite young at the company and I feel like upper management is betting on my development. However, I'm feeling very insecure and all these responsibilities are stacking up to the point where I am starting to feel that if I don't come up with a good methodology to manage many different projects at the same time, I will get overwhelmed and things will start to fall apart.

I wanted to ask for some guidance on how to better organize myself and these projects, how to deal with the daily struggles when you feel lost and don't know how to proceed.

606,6,How to escape the jobless pit of people with a degree but no prior work experience?,1600810779,"Preface: 

I am a recently graduated (May 2020) ME from an ABET certified school with a 2.93 GPA and no prior internship experience. My primary interests are in machines, fluid mechanics, energy production, CAE/CAD, and the field that always seems to be dealing with these, aerospace, but also I'm not averse to MEP or HVAC. I am not interested in manufacturing, quality engineering etc., but at this point, I'd probably take a job if I could get one. I have been applying for jobs without success, and in the meantime, I have gotten my EIT and am studying for the TFS PE exam.

&amp;#x200B;

Title point:

I have been noticing in my job applications that there is a noticeable gap in the experience levels for which jobs are available. At one end there are the jobs that are seeking currently enrolled students with a GPA of (generally) 3.0 or higher and possibly some related experience. Then there are the jobs for graduates that *require* 1, 2, 5 years of experience in a highly specific field or skill (sometimes also with a required GPA of 3.0 or higher). Positions that are in between these categories, I would say true entry-level positions, are scarce.

I'm applying for jobs anywhere and mostly in the fields I'm interested in, but pretty much always, I am not even meeting the basic requirements for the position, which I frankly feel is not the way of an engineer to apply for jobs one doesn't qualify for. Not to mention the difficulty of sinking so much effort into cover letters for positions that are very likely to reject me without even reading the letter due to not meeting the basic requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions: Do I apply for internships? Do I apply for internships that require one to be currently enrolled? 

To what extent should I be particular with the fields that I apply to, if at all?

What are some ways for me to gain experience? Or do I have all the experience I need to get my first job?

611,11,"Would it be practical to significantly increase radiative cooling of the earth, using one-directional (wickless) heat pipes to carry subsurface heat up to radiative coolers at night?",1600807625,"Hi All,

I've been curious about this idea for a while and have been looking for a place to ask this question.  Ask Science doesn't seem to like it. Here's the background:

1. Climate change seems to be increasing the earth's surface temperature
2. Sub-surface heat (e.g. water beneath the ice caps) may not easily reach the surface, because rock, soil, ice and snow are poor thermal conductors
3. Heat pipes can support enormous heat flux, and when they lack a wick they tend to be unidirectional (liquid can't flow up against gravity, so they only conduct heat upward. When the temperature differential goes the other way, the stop working)
4. Radiating heat into space at night is an effective way of eliminating it
5. Also: Some materials exist which predominantly radiate heat in the atmospheric window while reflecting other wavelengths. This might help increase radiative cooling without increasing daytime absorption.

My question:  I'm looking for a rough but rational way of assessing the feasibility of something like this.  I imagine it being possible to make hundreds of thousands or even millions of cheap heatpipes out of mostly plastic (more conductive materials at top and bottom) and stick them all over the ice caps or other places where there is significant heat retained below the surface.

612,12,Wastewater plumbing/moving wastewater uphill,1600806999," Hi - I am an electrical engineer/avid diy'er and I recently posted this question in a home improvement sub and got no results. I realized it's probably a more engineering related question. I have included the pictures here: [Pic 1](https://imgur.com/eIMcrrG) [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/RdA3xW6). This question involves something I am working on personally, not at work. The question relates to pumping systems:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, looking for advice here. I have a remote cabin I recently acquired that I use for hunting, riding sleds, etc. The property consists of a main cabin, which has electricity, well water, and a septic tank (that is oversized for the application.) Then, there is a second cabin on the property that is approximately 45-50' away. **I am trying to add utilities to the second cabin** so I can use it for a place for friends (or maybe my brother) to stay. For the record there is no building office here, this cabin is seriously in the middle of nowhere, and the state has no records of anything that happens around here. Also worth mentioning that this property is not used even close to full time, maybe 40 days a year max, rarely more than 2 per week.

The previous owners ran electricity and a water supply line out to the 2nd cabin, and began to renovate, but I bought the cabin before the renovation is was finished, and am picking up where they left off.

The key issue here is that there is an elevation gradient on the property. The septic tank is buried about 2' underground near the main cabin, but the ground slopes down by about 2 feet between the tank and the outbuilding. The ground surface at the outbuilding is approximately the same elevation as the top of the septic tank. (I measured this with a laser system) The floor of the outbuilding, where the toilet would be, is about 1.5' above the ground. **How do I get the waste water from the outbuilding into the septic tank?**

There are 2 ways I can think of, reference crudely drawn diagram included.

Option 1, buildings shown in red: Install macerating toilet system [Link](https://www.ferguson.com/product/sfa-saniflo-usa-sanigrind-pro-115v60-v-pump-for-closet-bowl-san014/_/R-2501739) and bury waste pipe below the frost line. Not sure if this is kosher because the installation instructions for the macerator state that any vertical rise must come before any horizontal run. In other words the waste pipe must leave the macerator vertically, then gravity drain horizontally. In order to accomplish this, the waste pipe would have to be above ground level, as the floor is already above the septic tank level. Could I get away with using a macerator, as I would be basically using it to move waste horizontally, and not really pushing the limits of the pump in the first place? I have been reading several posts on forums where macerator systems were used in outbuildings with no issue in situations like this.

Option 2, buildings shown in purple: install a standard gravity drain toilet with an intermediate waste pit in the space between the buildings, use a sewage ejector [Link](https://www.zoellerpumps.com/en-us/products/sewage-pumps/residential/260-series#product-specifications) to move the waste from the intermediate tank into the main septic tank. I would prefer not to use this option because I would need to bury electrical to the pit tank to facilitate pumping. I would obviously have to do it if there was no other way.

People told me not to do it because

1. the workload would be too much
2. neither company would be comfortable with me doing it and would fire/rescind the offer

I just wanted to let you all know that I ignored that and did take both offers and even took a 4-week summer course at the same time. 2 jobs are a lot easier when all work is remote and you're a student with nothing else to do (which I specified in the original post). Remote work means more work can be automated or approached efficiently without the distractions of an office and lab environment (something I initially didn't think was as feasible working at a powerplant for one of them). Workday was typically 6-8 hours long, with 3-4 hours spent on projects from both locations and the rest of the time in meetings or dealing with shitty work software. 3-5 hours per week was spent on summer classes. 

I received a fulltime offer from one following graduation and made my resume look better. also had enough left over to pay for my final semester's tuition and half my student loan debt when the time comes.

- someone's gotta spend time organizing 
- not super searchable/ can't file a lesson learned under two different headings

As for general catch-alls, I imagine that we could write something about the tenant being responsible to clean the sand off the property at the end of the lease. We want to also add something about physically protecting the house from sandblasting damage - for example, with an industrial/thick curtain.

I put a lot of value on work life balance and I’m slightly concerned that they will expect long hours on a regular basis (despite being a salaried position). I know I can simply ask but I’m not sure I would feel confident in any answer they would give me because obviously they don’t want to scare people away.
I have no problem working longer hours every once in a while to meet deadlines but I also don’t want to be taken advantage of and working long hours all the time.
Is there any other surprises (good or bad) that I should except if I move forward?

655,55,Math grad looking for an efficient pathway to more advanced engineering after being away from math for a while,1600720763,"Hi all, had a question for the engineerfolk/academiafolk here.

I graduated as a double major in mathematics and journalism, but decided to go down the writing route for a career instead of something more engineering-focused. I ended up writing for about 8 years before finally going back to a more data-focused role (in marketing).

I enjoy my work a lot and don't have any immediate plans of moving from it, but I also know I want to graduate to another technical level beyond what's currently kind of data science-lite at some point. I would love to get into something that's more related to aeronautics (an absolute dream job would be working on anything in engineering that's space-related).

I don't know if the route is publicly-available resources, or if it requires going back for a masters. I'd really want to dig into something closer to what I studied as an undergraduate (applied/engineering) but I have no idea on the pathway to get there if it goes through grad school, for a couple reasons:

* I'm absolutely terrible at standardized tests and always have been (and I think they don't accurately represent skill levels, but that's a whole other thing).
* I'm literally a decade removed from academia so the whole idea of getting letters of rec is completely moot.
* I wasn't \*the greatest\* student because I devoted almost all my time to my jobs and additional activities beyond studying (you know, the stuff that actually gets you a job).
* I'd love to find something cost-effective and time-efficient (part-time or full-time).

None of these are absolute dealbreakers, (minus the letter of rec part) and I'm ready/willing to grind out any of it where needed.

I'm at the beginning of the exploration and I'm sure there are plenty of people here that have gone through the same process. So I was wondering if anyone has any advice or go-to resources here before I start smashing Google to go down a rabbit holes with terrible/wrong advice and FrEe MoNeY cLiCk HeRe.

I have a degree in Materials Science and slightly unrelated internship experience in Manufacturing Engineering. Since looking I've been called back for 4 positions (1 interview I was unprepared for and bombed, 1 after the interview it seemed clear I didn't have the experience they were looking for, and the 2 I'll talk about here). 

I got called for a Materials position and went through two rounds of interviews for it which I felt confident about but ultimately I didn't get the position for ""someone who better fit the needs of the position.""

I guess some specific questions I have would be:

Am I doing myself a disservice to take a job that isn't going to give me a large number of the skills that relate to my ultimate career goals?

Should I view this situation as any experience is good experience and try my hand again in 1-2 years?

Anyone in a hiring position, would you see my resume with 1-2 years of not completely relevent technical experience differently (I guess more appealing) than a new graduate fresher out of school but a lack of experience in general?

662,62,Making a driveshaft disconnect out of scrap,1600717655,"I'm starting on building a 4WD tractor out of crappy old cars and some other stuff I have laying around. I'm currently having a problem with my planning of the drivetrain. 

Engine + 1st gearbox will be a 1.9td from a golf mk3 mounted longitudinally with the diff welded so I can use only one of the drive outputs. 

Next will be a gearbox and transfercase combo from a UAZ that I plan on modifying for the project to get an extra output for a PTO on the transfer case. 

This however will cause both axle driveshafts to be connected, so permanent 4WD with no center diff.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to create some kind of drive disconnect for the front driveshaft. Ideally would be switchable from driving position, but I can live with getting out and connecting something under the tractor too.

1st idea I had wast to build a small box and populate it with sliding gears/splines from a random car gearbox.

2nd idea was a splined sleeve directly on the driveshaft that i can slide and lock with a simple pin from under the tractor.

The advantage of the first option is that its possible to make it work with a lever just like in a normal gearbox, but that would be much more complicated than the second option.

I can't think of any other options that wont crate a mess of chains and jackshafts which don't look as pretty as nice contained gearboxes. Other than buying the part I need of course, but that's out of budget.

I work for a large company. In my current role I get customer problems/requests and have to work to resolve them. Sometimes it requires longer term (weeks/months) cross-functional collaboration to work through the issue. 

My concern is that I don’t have the authority to drive where decisions/scope are made. I make suggestions to the team but at the end of the  day I am an individual contributor / engineer and not an official project engineer. The cross functional engineers I work with have more experience in their expertise and I value their input but it’s hard to drive scope/action items when the issues are complex. We do try our best  to solve things most of the time but there are the one or two things I don’t know how to bring to a resolution. 

I struggle with knowing how to communicate to all the stakeholders on the scope and get others to provide a response. Because I am not an official project mgr it feels out of place for me to take the reigns and start implementing project charters for project statement, stakeholders, scope, etc. not to mention needing to do my own work. 

My company does have specific project engineers to drive large or high priority projects for cross functional teams. 

I feel like I am at a loss because I have to do my daily work, and also figure out a way to communicate with everyone on longer term issues besides talking to them individually. Am I overstepping my bounds if I start setting out group emails with summary and action items for future issues?

667,67,CHEM PhD vs. MEng in Materials Science Engineering,1600713295,"Hi everyone,

I’m a current chemistry PhD student (just started my 2nd year) at a mid-rank American university. I have a B.S. in chemistry with a minor in mathematics. I am beginning to feel burnout on my research and have looked into transitioning my career path to materials science and engineering. I held a government internship for two years in the subject, mainly studying materials durability. If I switch paths I would complete a M.Eng. degree at the same school I am attending now and would be sacrificing my chemistry PhD stipend and tuition waiver.  But truly, I do not see myself as a research scientist. Instead I envision working on and leading projects like I helped with during my internship (materials qualification, durability testing, etc.). I just don’t see the need for me to get a chemistry PhD, and I think a big reason for my decision was My mentors told me that I could and I was scared to enter the chemistry industry with only a BS. My questions for all of you are:

1. For someone who wants to work as an engineer with a natural science background is a M. Eng. with a B.S. in chemistry worthwhile?
2. Is it career suicide to drop out of a Ph.D. program and into an engineering masters program?
3. Is a Masters degree in engineering marketable? I’ve gone through undergrad thinking I needed a PhD because I was studying raw chemistry. I have no clue what the industry looks like for engineering. 
4. Do jobs require some sort of research background or are there jobs that look for engineers like I desire to be?
5. Is it reasonable to feel like I’m letting down my PhD advisor if I drop the program? This is a big one for me. 

Apart from these questions, any insight would be helpful. I’d like to know what YOUR path was/is.

671,71,Food packaging engineers/scientists- I have wrinkly pretzels!,1600711026,"I have a “home-based” soft pretzel businesses.  I want to start shipping within my state (Ohio). Cold Chain shipping cost too much and I’d rather not ship if that is my only option.
 
I've been reading about MAP, modified atmosphere packaging, but the cost of a nitrogen filler &amp; sealer is out of the budget.  Especially, not knowing that it will get me where I want to be.
 
Ingredients:
 
Flour, water, milk, butter, malt, sugar.
 
Issue:
 
I’m getting a “wrinkly skin” when my pretzels are bagged for a few hours to 48 hours.  We bake a traditional German Pretzel with a “set” outer crust.  It is this crust that is wrinkling.
 
I can ship next day delivery via UPS anywhere in the state.  24 hours should be my max time needed in the packaging but I think it is best to target 48 hours to be safe.
 
Test:
 
On Counter, not covered: Just hardens after 8+ hours, no issues with outside skin appearance.  Not edible / sellable.  
 
Tied bag:  Slight wrinkles, gloss &amp; shine on the surface.  Lacks smell.  70-75% of taste at 24 hours.
 
3mil Vacuum bag, w/o pulling a vacuum, just sealing:  Lots of surface wrinkles, maintains smell well, 95-100% of taste. Baking (reheating) reduces the wrinkles but I do not think the appearance is acceptable. Note: I have been pulling a little air out when I do these tests but not pulling the bag “tight” around the pretzel.
 
3mil Vacuum bag, w/o pulling a vacuum, just sealing + oxygen absorbers: Same as above.  I think it wrinkled quicker oxygen absorbers?
 
Frozen pretzel sealed in a home grade vacuum bags:  No go, the pretzels collapse once they thaw.
 
6x6x3 inch Vacuum chamber: worked well.  Nice smell, low to no wrinkles, the taste was at 98-100%. To be clear, this is a 6x6x3 inch container that you use a home vacuum sealer to pull out the air. Marketed for marinating meats.
 
Conclusion / Questions:
 
I do not understand why the vacuum bag with less “air” space works poorly but the 6x6x3 inch vacuum chamber works well.  Is there some sort of osmoses from the pretzel crumb to the air in the bag?
 
Does anyone think nitrogen filling would fix the issue?
 
Is there something I’m missing?
 
Is this a cause of the butter and/or sugar in my recipe? Meaning, is it worth making a batch to without butter and or sugar to see if it does the same thing in packaging?  I could drop the sugar out of the recipe, the butter would be harder.

Currently I drill &gt;100 holes into a 3/8"" steel plate and this is very time consuming and physically taxing.

I have several ideas and wanted your input! 

The obvious is to purchase a single tool CNC machine to perform this operation. Obviously this is very expensive!

Another option would be to have a drilling/milling machine with an autofeed plunge. This is a happy medium as it is not super expensive. The issue is that it would still require someone to move the x-y table and press go for a new hole. Much easier for the operator to do, but still time consuming. 

A 3rd option would be to modify the above mentioned machine with an Arduino to automatically move the x-y table following a drilling operation. This option is interesting but I foresee the issue of as the drill bit wears, drilling time would increase and therefore the x-y movement could not be time dependent. This would add significant complexity to the control systems that would need to be designed from scratch by me (inexperienced with control systems). Not to mention that playing around with a mills electronics can go quite badly so I also have safety concerns.

My thought is that the workers could dunk the cloth in the concrete slurry, form it over a base structure (a removable mold), then let it set until it creates a perfect little Penguin house.

Additionally, would it be viable to use GFRC (glass fiber reinforced) as a substitute for concrete in order to cut down on weight?

I came into school with the goal of going through medical school, but an opportunity I had to work with a veteran amputee sparked a passion in me. My current goal is, upon graduation, to work on research and development for neuro-prosthetics. The only thing is, as I go deeper down this hole of interest, I keep finding that everywhere I turn, people are warning to stay away from a B.S. in biomedical engineering, as it limits your opportunities to work on actual research and development. I think that my interest lies in the electrical engineering aspect of designing and working on these systems, and I am currently working towards a concentration of ECE within biomedical engineering; however, I’m starting to question if the path I’m taking is the one that will get me to where I want to be.

My main worry about switching majors is the finances, as I have needed loans and I don’t have a lot of money to cover expenses from having to take more classes on. I thought about doing a masters in EE after graduating from my current major, but I know how difficult that would be, as I don’t think I would have enough of a foundation in that material for a masters.

My question is this, what do you think is the best path that I could take? Would it be wise to remain on my current path and pursue a masters in BME or EE, or is it worth taking the time to backtrack a bit and fulfill a major in EE, with a potential minor in BME. I’m graciously thinking of this as a sophomore, and not farther into this, so I know that I have a bit more flexibility. I’m willing to make sacrifices to reach my goal, I just feel a bit lost in how exactly to most efficiently reach it.

I truly appreciate any feedback anyone is able to provide. It would honestly make my year if someone related to the field of prosthetics was able to provide some knowledge about what sort of paths lead to developing those systems.

Something I can change the pulleys on for different speeds. I don't like inverter generators because they are finicky and easily broken with large inductive loads like my well pump. I want belt fed because I can swap the motor easy. 

I found an example, a generac 17 kw portable generator with a 26 KW surge capacity. It has a 22 lb flywheel. I figure a 30 lbs wheel for a 13 HP motor would give me all the surge power I need. The motor would be going around 1800-2200 rpm. So I figure 8 hp. 

I have a 13 KW donor generator head from a broken generator that I want to use. So I would have a oversized generator head kept cool and it would have the capacity to start things with the torque that the wheel provides. 

I need something that can attach to a 1 inch shaft. What is the rpm limit on a cast iron say 12 inch flywheel? 

I see a lot of old hit or miss flywheels for sale on ebay that fits the bill weight wise but they usually are on engines that might do 1000 rpm. I don't want to make a 300 mph 50 lbs missile. 

Would I be better off having a solid steel wheel fabricated? 

I could either put it on the engine which should be at a lower speed of 1800-2200 rpm or I can put it on the generator head itself and avoid potential belt slippage but it would turn at 3600.

But the timeline is at least a year down the line, probably a bit longer. 

I have some questions I am hoping someone could answer:

\- If I went to grad school abroad, but came back to the US to work, how would an international degree be regarded back in the US? 

\- Is there anyone currently in grad school abroad that was allowed to leave the US to attend in-person? Or, if the pandemic is still going on and there are still travel restrictions against US travelers (ughhh), will I even be able to leave the country to attend grad school?

\- Would attending grad school abroad be the best way to begin working abroad, if I decide to stay in the country where I am studying? Are there certain countries that are easier to get jobs in after getting a masters degree?

I am a visual artist who is going to have a light installation inside a church in 3 weeks.

I will hang these balls with the help of wire tightened horizontally (well, almost) between the columns of the church. I don't want any glass balls to fall on any's head, so here I am just double checking if I got this right:

I plan to tighten the wire in a way that the line falls off (with the glass balls already hanging on it) 15 degrees in comparison to a horizontal line between the columns. I have seen a table that this would about double the stress on the wire. Is this correct? the balls weight about 10 kgs, so the stress would be around 20 kgs, correct? Yes I will put a factor 12 for safety in my minimum requirements to the material, but I just want to make sure I got the maths underlying this right and I have no experience in hanging stuff horizontally rather than vertically.

738,38,Finance to Engineering Question / Advice,1600629665,"I have a read a few of these threads before but somewhat in a unique situation and wanted to get thoughts from the subreddit. I (26M) currently work in high finance (Private Equity / Venture Capital and previously investment banking) and like my job but really want to learn more of a technical topics like ECE (Cyber-Physical Systems) or Applied Physics. Most of what i do now is financial number crunching, diligence, speaking to company mgmt. teams / entrepreneurs to see if we want to invest capital into their business. I perceive that i'm missing out in creativity, building stuff with my hands, and lack the technical ability and wherewithal to build solutions to problems that i see or am generally curious about. I also perceive that many of the companies and teams that i'm speaking with are building very cool and innovative products that only wish I had better technical knowledge of - maybe this is a grass is greener on the other side syndrome?

I have a degree in Finance / Statistics from a top ranked UG B school. I went to an engineering focused HS and taken up to Calc III / Linear Algebra and calculus based Mechanics / E&amp;M but haven't really touched any real math / science in my undergrad (I placed out due to AP Credit) and have forgotten most of this information.

I was thinking of going to my community college and taking 50-60 credits of all the necessary courses (Statics, Dynamics, Mechanics, E&amp;M, Modern Physics, Calc I-III, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra, Algorithms &amp; Data Structures and a few others) to apply for an integrated BS/MS or MS in ECE at top ranked program (CMU, GT, Michigan, Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, Cornell). It seems from my research many don't actually require a BS engineering degree to get into the MS program, just need to be able to show that you can handle the rigor of the masters classes. Is this correct?

Here is the tough part - is this even a good idea? I realize I would probably be taking a pretty big pay cut and leave a good career path to do this, take on debt where i have none right now, and there is no certainty that i will even be able to get into a top ranked program even if I were successful in all my pre-req classes. Am i being stupid in even considering this? I would probably quit my job to take the pre-req classes and I can do it relatively cheap at my community college (&lt;$3000 a semester for a full 18 credit course load) and it would likely take 3 semesters of full time study to take all the above mentioned courses. I took a look at the BU LEAP program but looks overpriced.

Will programs like the above even consider me? My end goal is probably to work for a few years and gain experience in a electrical engineering team at a consumer products company and then if i see something worth building or have an idea that I want to raise capital for I would try to join a growing start up or start a business of my own (probably something consumer electronics related). I also really enjoy investing so I may even want to end back up in PE/VC later in my career - i think my technical knowledge could add a lot of value.

What are your thoughts - am i being stupid in considering this? My biggest motivator is really learning something new and getting confident in my own technical abilities.

## **Main Questions**
1. How much will bottlenecking of air flow limit the effectiveness of my design idea?
2. Are the built in holes in the metal large enough that I could place the wall directly on window framing?
3. Is providing bottom vents from within home chamber helpful or detrimental?
4. If I block the exhaust fan from pulling air from the home area, will it be effective in forcing air through the wall chambers? And would it help at all?
5. Is this a dumb fucking idea that won't work or will take too much effort? aka is this effective at preventing heat transfer into the home when I do not want it and using the heat when I do


### Environment
* Climate is Warm-Hot 9-12 months out of the year
* Travel North America North to South to maintain ~70-90F weather
* Rarely expect temps below 40F at night
* NO AC unit
* Diesel Heater when necessary


### HVAC Plan
radiant barriers, convection, and venting to exhaust trapped hot air when desired, or force trapped air in.

* Radiant Barrier sandwich = directly on van metal and on 1/4"" Luon walls
* Air gap between 1/8"" - 2"" between radiant barriers (Van metal walls fluctuate)
* Exhaust Fan up to 900CFM
* Bottom Vent inside home chamber (gap between floor and wall)
* Bottom Vents also at bottom of van body (see images)
* No R-Value insulation anywhere (bygones fluffy stuff!)
* ""Window"" Air inlets for exhausting home air


### Logic
\#1 reason: **I want the van to cool off at night as quick as possible.** 

* With NO AC for forced cooling, want tactics to reduce as much heat transfer
* With no R-Value insulation Air moves freely between bottom vents and exhaust fan
* Exhaust Fan serve many purpose
	* Only draw air through home via ""open window""
	* Allow Wall air to vent outside roof
	* (Hopefully) force air through wall air chamber
	* Act as ceiling fan with air chamber open or closed (push hotter trapped air into home)


### Paragraph Description of plan

Since I summer dwell, I want to keep heat out during the day and let the cooler air in at night. Thus low R-value should let the heat escape the van at night. IF my walls are radiant barrier trapped air with no insulation, air can move freely. If the flange for the van has openings which allow air from the walls into the fan path, it could convect outside. IF I close the fan flange I could stop air from inside the home exhausting out, and the fan CFM would pull air from the trapped air in the walls. OR, I could close the lid of the fan, and use it as a ceiling fan, hopefully pushing the trapped air from the walls down into the van if I wanted to try and warm it up a bit. 

Fresh air would mostly come from a single vent in the floor of the van into the home. The walls would have gaps at the floor to allow convection. The holes at the bottom of the body panels I assume won't play a large role but haven't though much about the cons of opening them up for air flow.



### Concerns

* There will not be enough air flow in air chamber (too many bottlenecks)
* IF I must keep interior wall away from metal surrounding windows for air flow, increase complexity of construction greatly
* Will the fan actually be able to assist in moving air inside the air chamber when flange opening closed?
* Will condensation get trapped in certain areas and cause issue?

.

Again I know this is a lot and has complexities to it, and the final plan has many parts and ideas attached to it.

742,42,Computer Engineering Student who Wants to Build Chips But Not for Warfare — how to get the right role for me?,1600627339,"Hello Engineers,

Im a sophomore Computer Engineering student, so Ive just barely taken two courses in digital design and barely a couple courses in Electronics. But I was recently thinking about my career and couldn’t find the answer to my questions on the web. 

Besides being a student, I work as a front end web dev “software engineer” in the automotive industry. What I like about the my job is the product, and how I feel its serving the needs of civilian customers. What I dont like about it is I feel that all the knowledge needed to do my job is on the internet. And I feel this type of job is the type to get outsourced, as a lot of team members who work on similiar code base are already overseas. Im in USA by the way. 

I thought that perhaps when my Computer Engineering degree is finished. I will have the chops to apply for a true engineering role. The type of work done by the mega companies of the US, such as intel, broadcom, qualcom etc. 

In thinking about these companies, I was wondering how I could go about finding jobs in these places where the products are made for civilian application. I get very scared thinking about what if the work I do contributes to violence, even if its in the name of defense. Like I said at my current job, I have no fear of something making something unethical. 

Since this stuff is all in my head. I was hoping somebody would guide my thoughts to what the real world actually is. Is it possible to work for these large companies and build stuff for their civilian projects. What are the pros and cons I might incur? And how do I ensure when I apply for them in a couple years that I apply for the right role at the companies?

758,58,Question about Ownership of Intellectual Property,1600611865,"A bit of background, I am a recent engineering graduate. Before graduation I participated in a problem-based solution activity that my university did with a foreign university, and I had a pretty decent idea (nobody suggested any modifications) and my group decided to go with it. The people involved were pretty impressed, and it was all good. The lecturer from my university said that its a good idea and that I should build a prototype that we can submit to the Technology Expo happening soon. The foreign university agreed to pay the fee for the entering the expo, and the lecturer said he will cover the cost of fabricating the prototype (not a large some, its a simple design). I thought this is great, an opportunity for me come up with a prototype my idea and present it. 

So I spent a good amount of time coming up with a design that can be fabricated which is not an easy task considering all of the tolerances and practicality in fabrication, (with some supervision from the lecturer). I sent the design for fabrication, got it and prepared the prototype. 

Now, when its almost time for submission I saw in the form that we can submit one person's name as  team leader and the rest of the names are contributors (only the leader's name will be written on the certificates). Out of the blue, I asked my lecturer that I will be the team leader right since the idea was mine and I did all of the work. And he loses his shit, says that he took the initiative and paid for the whole thing, and that I shouldn't even have asked this question. Am I wrong to think that I deserve that title?

805,5,Help me troubleshoot a scissor lift,1600522899,"At work I have been instructed to install controls on a scissor lift. The lift was originally attached to a machine with its own controller. It was cut away from the original machine and now there are 2 cables hanging off of it. One of the cables is clearly the power supply wiring, as there are 4 wires of different colors including a green one, and they all eventually connect to a control board. The green wire is clearly ground, and the three other wires appear to first go through fuses on the board, and then make their way through a contactor. The other side of the contactor goes to a cable that goes directly to the motor. The rest of the board looks to be too complicated to understand what is going on, but there are 4 cables leaving the board and going to other places. So in total, there are 2 cables that go to nowhere with wires hanging out,one being the power supply, and 5 other cables. 2 of the 5 cables are going to limit switches. Then there are 2 cables going to the electric motor, one which is clearly a power supply, and the other looks like some sort limiting switch just based on the coloring of the wires. There is a cable that goes to a valve, and this valve controls the flow to the hydraulics in the lift. The last cable is my biggest struggle. There are 5 black wires hanging out of it. 4 of those wires are going to the board, and the 5th wire is not connected to anything.

The two directions I am interested in taking are listed below:  
1) Scrap the existing board and create my own electrical system. This is a little bit more in my comfort zone but way more expensive. My company is definitely pinching pennies right now.  
2) Somehow supply the scissor lift with power and try to figure out what the 5 black wires do. I think this would be the ideal solution, but this solution is way out of my comfort zone. I am a Mechanical Engineer without much electrical knowledge and there is no documentation or electrical schematics for it. I have a nice ohmmeter to work with, but otherwise I don't have enough experience to say what other tools I have to assist me.

So I guess my question is would you go with the 1st solution, or would you go with the 2nd solution, and how might you go about testing the 5 (technically 4) black wires?

My current job title is application engineer and a part of my job is guiding sales reps to using the “right” designs and selections of our product for their projects. 

My company’s “gimmick” is semi-custom solutions, so a lot of the time I essentially do “front-end“ design of the product. 

Anyways, since I have joined the company, one of my main roles has to work with sales partners on developing national accounts. Many times these have semi-custom or custom solutions that require front end design by me.

 To put it simply, national accounts went from being non-existent to ~$60 mil business in 3.5 years. The repeat business has invigorated the company that honestly had mediocre growth before I joined. 

I don’t get any of the kudos or finder‘s fee, and I am lucky to get 3-5% of my (mediocre) annual salary as a bonus. I honestly feel like management gets all of the credit and all of the bonus money, especially when the president drives in a few months ago with his new Maserati. 

I guess this is normal? To do a lot of the grunt work but be overshadowed by those in charge, and getting a bonus that equates to an extra paycheck once a year? Is this what engineering is like? 

I don’t really get any career progression either. I figured if I performed well I would be promoted to new roles, but that hasn’t happened. I envisioned that I would start in my role and move on to more product design, and I’ve made that clear to my supervisor multiple times.

I'm currently a freshman at university studying Mechanical engineering. If you asked me why I choose engineering I would probably say for my love of science and combining creativity into that. Yet, when I see the engineering coursework, I'm so disinterested. Learning about mechanical parts is, simply put, boring. 

When I look around at the nature world, I always think to myself ""how does this work"". For example, if I see an oddly shaped tree I wonder to myself ""why did it grow like that?"". When I see a bruise heal so quickly, I am fascinated by the complexity of the human body. Yet, I don't really have this kind of mindset when it comes to engineering related parts (although, I do get fascinated from certain engineered things such as airplanes. It's crazy how this huge contraption made of tons of metal is able to fly). I would say that I like solving circuits, but the overall engineering process, I'm not sure.

When I look through the courses required for biology, everything on there fascinates me and I would love to study it. When I look through the engineering course list, I can probably say maybe 50% interest me if not less. I do have the possibility of getting a concentration in biomedical engineering. Or a minor in biotechnology. But, what I'm contemplating now is whether or not I'm forcing engineering on myself. Maybe it's the job security and decent pay vs the uncertainty of a science degree.

I have Googled almost every engineering path, and materials science and engineering is my top priority right now. My post is only about my expectations for after graduation, as I don't mind biting the sour apple to get to my dream job. 

I'm good at math, but frankly I don't like it. I have read that there is a ton of math throughout the school bench, and I'm fine with that, because I have also read that it's only during uni and there isn't much math after as everything is done by computers. My first question to materials scientists or engineers is, is that true for your career? According to some online sources materials science and engineering has the least amount of math compared to other engineering fields. 

Secondly, how stressful are your jobs? This is very important to me, as I don't handle stress too well because of personal reasons (it's not like I can't take any at all either - I expect to do well in uni as I'm very driven). I have read there is a very balanced desk- and field work, and that everything you may learn during your time in uni is actually relevant unlike many other engineering fields. And how much customer contact do you have? Are you constantly supervised? Or whatever else lead to a stressful job, how stressful is yours. 

And finally. Two years into my business degree I quit it. It's was just too wide. We had marketing, finance, law etc. But it was necessary. When I look at materials science and engineering, it looks like a niche. It's very narrow, but can be applied to many many industries. Is this a true statement?

856,56,How to fortify an air mattress for long term use. - continued,1600456850,"This was a question from 4 years ago and I wanted to add to it. I have been a structural engineer since 2002 designing commercial and residential buildings. In around 2010 I decided to broaden my work path and started marketing online. In late 2017 I wanted to solve a problem. That was how to sleep comfortably while camping. So the research began and the starting point was an $8 intex air mattress.

For reference, this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3mfkem/how\_to\_fortify\_an\_air\_mattress\_for\_long\_term\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3mfkem/how_to_fortify_an_air_mattress_for_long_term_use/)

Anyone who's used an air mattress knows they don't last. Typically a tiny pin hole will develop, and if they last past the tiny hole, they will blow a seam. What is not so obvious is that sleeping on an air mattress causes your body to sink through the night. This can cause back pain. The reason is because the tensioned plastic just stretches, causing the drop. 

To solve these problems, I came to the idea that almost all the stresses inside the air mattress can be passed to an exterior fabric cover - 6 sided. Fabric that is similar to canvas, non-stretch. The way to transfer the stresses is by making the cover slightly smaller. I call it the tensioned mattress cover.

\- No more holes

\- No seam blowouts

\- No sinking through the night

The mattress now behaves like a structural slab. Albeit a weak one, similar in analysis. I've had a prototype blown up in my spare bedroom for over 2 years, it holds the air for months. I've taken them camping, made air beds out of them, and I've never had an air mattress lose the air.

Just wanted to share because there is a solution for air mattresses and they can last, and they can be comfortable.",AskEngineers,False,Markmgs,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ivcmkd/how_to_fortify_an_air_mattress_for_long_term_use/
857,57,"Is it possible to run a pump with 1.5"" port connections through 5/8"" pipe?",1600456360,"Hi everyone, I've inherited a test bench at work that is intended take measurements as hot oil is pumped through a radiator. The piping on this bench was laid out horribly. As the title says, the outlets in my pump are 1.5"". From the discharge side of the pump is an immediate 90deg bend followed by a reducer down to 5/8"" diameter pipe. 

5/8"" pipe was apparently chosen bec that fits the size of various instruments and filters that we already have, like our flowmeter. Also in the system are about 10 other 90deg bends, a few valves, a heat exchanger, two different sized filters, and eventually the radiator.

The pump is a 3-phase, 0.5hp positive displacement pump that's intended to run at 1A at 480V. 

The issue is that the pump draws 1.8A until it is eventually shut off by the heater elements in the starter. I think this is happening bec there is too much resistance in the line and the pump cannot get up to its set rpm.

Anyway, it's my job to get the thing to work consistently and I'm trying to do it without ripping out all the pipe and buying new flow meters and everything else to fit 1.5"" pipe.

Questions:
1) Is it possible to have a diameter reduction in the system (from 1.5"" to 5/8"") and for it to still work properly?
2) Does it matter if the reducer is right at the outlet of the pump, or further down the line? (say, I could get half of the system to 1.5"" pipe and the rest would stay at 5/8"". Would this be a substantial improvement?)
3) How many 90deg bends can a system like that handle? 

Note: I just ordered 1.5"" pipe from the reservoir to the suction side of the pump, bec I know this is an especially critical area.

But I was curious so I googled it and found that the peak efficiency for most car engines is around 7000 rpm, which is just passed the redline for most modern cars.

875,75,"Flexible, durable, waterproof, easy-care material w/ similar tensile strength to leather?",1600432019," Hey engineers!

I’m working on a project in the equestrian space, and hoping you can help me find the right material for one of the components.

I am trying to make completely waterproof halter for a horse.

Most are made of leather or nylon, but leather is hard to care for and nylon is too strong (will explain below). Some folks use Biothane, which is a very nice, waterproof, durable, leather-like material - but by itself, like nylon, it’s also too strong.

**Context on why being TOO strong is bad:**

While the halter has to be strong enough to withstand some pulling if my horse is reluctant to move, nylon and Biothane will not snap as easily as leather in an emergency situation - for example, if a tethered horse spooks at something, flips out, and gets tangled up. This kind of situation can be very harmful to the animal (and possibly the human) if the material won’t snap free **completely** with enough force in a **single**, jerking motion (as opposed to requiring **multiple** blows to rip completely, like a nylon, which could again cause injury).

Some folks add a piece of leather to a Biothane or nylon halter for this reason, but leather degrades over time without frequent cleaning/conditioning and will dry out when exposed to water too often. (It rains all the time here *and* my horses need to be hosed down every day, so this happens fast.)

So, I’m looking for a replacement material for leather that I can *either* use to make the whole thing, or add to a Biothane halter, that is:

* strong, but no too strong (similar tensile strength range to leather);
* flexible;
* durable;
* waterproof; and
* easy to care for.

Quality and safety are much more important to me than cost. I’ve been researching cork with a wax coating as one possibility, though I'm not confident yet that it'll be quite strong enough (you all may know better).

How come there are frequently hacking/phishing/ransomware incidents that hold critical equipment hostage when those system could  be practically airgapped?  
As i understand it the problem is legacy software, firmware and OS that is susceptible when connected to internet.   
Why are these not physically air gapped from the outside to ensure security?

Most newer instruments need to communicate in some form to input and output data, i imagine this could be solved by a ""dumb and blind"" hardware coded exchange system that puts any data into an something like ascii format, transfers this file to a separate processor that will only read these as table data. Nothing else is possible to get in our out than the standardized data fields, thus in any malware context the computers are air gapped.   
Bigger data like nMRI, CT or røntgen can be output only as it only needs to go one way.

919,19,How to use a car alternator in conjunction with a wind turbine to generate power for a small air conditioner?,1600352535,"Hello everybody, I am a mechanical engineering student and I am working on a project but I need some considerable help with understanding the electronics and feasibility of it. 

I have a car that does not have a working air conditioner and fixing the AC in the car would cost me upwards of $1000. I wanted to resolve this issue (while simultaneously building my knowledge) by developing an air conditioning unit that could be installed on the car and would run on wind power. The wind speeds surrounding a driving car are comparable to the speed of the car; the idea is to capture this wind power by placing a wind turbine of sorts on the car's roof. The output of this wind turbine would go to an alternator, then a battery, then an inverter, then finally to power a compressor and fans for the AC unit. The AC would be a variation of a mini split air conditioner with the cooling unit inside of the car and the compressor and condenser outside on the roof of the car behind the wind turbine. 

Some things I need to study much more/understand better: 

**Wind turbine design**: which is best for this application? For example on my drive to work, I travel anywhere between 0 and 65 mph. How would a wind turbine be affected by these fluctuating wind speeds? My average speed is around 45 mph, and I occasionally sit at red lights or in traffic, but not for more than a minute or two. Are speeds on the higher end detrimental to the turbine? What power output does the turbine have at various wind speeds? What sort of drag will a wind turbine produce at various wind speeds? How could I reduce this drag to prevent wasted car horsepower? 

**Alternator**: A car alternator will charge a car battery even when an engine is idling at 700 rpm, as alternators triple the engine rpm. Will I be able to use an alternator for this purpose? What rpm can i expect a turbine will spin at? I know there are ways to alter alternators (lol) so that they can work for different applications, but I am no electrical engineer and I struggle a little to understand how i would modify an alternator to work for this application.  

**Battery**: which battery would be best for energy storage purposes? A regular car battery? A deep cycle golf cart sort of battery? 

**Compressor and AC unit**: Is it smart to take the power output from the battery and run it through an inverter to then power the battery? In that way, I end up losing some of the power in the conversion process. Is it possible to use a compressor that runs directly off of the DC voltage to compress the R410A and fans? 

The average vehicle class size is around 100 cu ft. Using online calculators, I found this volume would need about 2000 Btu/hr of cooling. I believe (although this is an approximation I made based on other air conditioners specification sheets), the power requirement for AC's are usually a factor of 10 less than their cooling capacity. So a 10,000 Btu AC unit usually requires a power input of around 1kW. Using this ratio, I believe that in my application, I would need about 200 W of power for my car AC unit. 

If you guys have some relevant knowledge that could help me, or links to some journals on this topic, it would be greatly appreciated!

922,22,"Car paint --&gt; Why does RED paint fade, yet BLACK doesn't",1600347918," Ok, I just got a random thought which i think deserves some attention.

Most of us have seen that yellow, and in particular red paints on cars always fade when they stay in the sun for prolonged amounts of times (think years here).

The cause is related to the fact that red and yellow rays in the suns colour spectrum contain the lowest energy. If these are the ones that are reflected (hence the red and yellow colour) it means that all the other(more high energy waves) are absorbed. And this causes the paint to degenerate more quickly.

BUT WHAT ABOUT BLACK PAINT!

930,30,"Help needed in ""Design an inspection machine for measuring roundness/runout of rod journal pins of the crank"".",1600338866," 

So we just started on a this project we plan on presenting as our final year project. This is an industrial project and we get an A if it gets delivered and D if we dont deliver the project. None of the group members has worked before on any precision engineering projects nor have we studied any such course.

After some studying/digging, we plan on using a V-block 3-probe roundness/run-out measurement method. the crank will be rotating continuously and the v-block will stay on the journal pin under The senors to be used are solartron with resolution upto 0.15microns. We are looking for literature and guidance that can lead us to a refined product.

The problems so far are:

1. We are unable to find some solid procedure that can help us change the sensor output information into some useful information, that will eventually lead to calculate the total runout, while compensating the errors.
2. Some papers mention use of FFT, DFT etc., for which we don't comprehend the need or reason.
3. The V-block+sensors mounting is a pivoted slider. The crank input is at constant angular velocity which makes irregular intervals of data acquired.
4. For the compensation of irregularities and to evaluate the accuracy of the method, I need to perform motion studies (with coordinates/orientation monitoring for analysis) on two things:

* motion study of V-block+3-probes on circlar profiles(self generated on cad) of runout ranges 0.001-0.1 mm.
* motion study of pivoted slider with probes mounted V-block placed on the rod journal pin for acquisition of orientation data.

Kindly suggest any literature, advice or help for the procedure(point1, although we did find one paper on v-block 3-point method but that was focused on error separation and was different in the sense that we have all 3 probes in between the V contacts with the pin). Also suggest any literature for caparison of probes orientation/probe angles. I'm planning on using Comsol or simulink for motion study, for that I need some tutorial/guidance. I want to be able to export the motion study data afterwards, so that I can use that data for Rondness+taper measurements.

Also, this post starts kind of heavy. But I promise, it gets better toward the end :)


I really don't know where to start with this. It's like my entire idea of my self has shattered into place. While it is terrifying, it feels like it's supposed to be happening. 


Let me back up.


I'm a sophomore, prospective MechE at Cornell. Since middle school, I've wanted to go into aerospace. My eyes were on NASA, my head beyond the clouds and crowding with the stars. This vision of my future, my desire to leave behind the life I was trapped in, was what motivated me to work hard enough to get into Cornell.


Fast forward. Fall, freshman year. I'm taking 20 credits. It's a lot, and I barely have enough time to breathe, but I'm surprisingly managing it. And then I get a call. 


It's my dad. My step family tried to murder him in his sleep. And they might've been coming for me.


For the next three months, I am living in hiding. My depression and anxiety have gone from bad to worse (this... was not the first tragic thing to happen in my family). I cant manage my classes. I have nothing left to give to Cornell Engineering. I barely pass chem. I dont pass math. And I dont care. Because what does it mean to me? I dont feel connected to life itself-- I dont want to feel connected to life, because life is miserable and cruel. I'm even less connected to my dream. There is no passion left. There's barely a will to live.

Next semester comes. I resolve to keep trying. Covid hits. And... something just clicks. A teacher believes in and supports me. I study regularly. I see a therapist and start antidepressants. I work out. As covid progresses, I keep working on myself. I appreciate life again. And as I get to know myself... I rediscover a lost passion.


The thing that drew me to space... it wasnt space itself. Rather, it was the idea of exploring an unknown frontier. That is the thing I want out of my career, out of my life-- traveling to foreign, wild locations, traversing rough terrains, all of it. That is one of the two things that gives me unadulterated joy in life. I could cry from happiness, because finding out this truth that was so deeply entrenched in the recesses of my mind puts _everything_ into a new perspective. And it _finally makes sense_.


Which leaves me at a conundrum. All I've thought about for years was aerospace. I'm essentially forgoing the entire path I based my life around for what, a decade? For some intangible idea that I cant properly describe? For a feeling?


That's why I said it was terrifying. But I know it's the right call to make. 


I still want to stay in engineering. For a while, I wasnt sure. But once i figured out this part of what I wanted, I realized I _did_ actually enjoy the discipline. 


Now, this is the question I'm dealing with: how do I reconcile these two things? A career in engineering, and a career where I get to explore crazy places? Where I travel to far off, remote locations? Does such a thing exist?

While looking for projects to build, I came across a really neat idea that I find quite fascinating.

That is,

an exoskeleton that is entirely analog, but provides lift assistance at different levels. I am currently doing research as to how this exoskeleton would work, and from the video below, it seems to be spring assisted.

I have so many questions, and yet my most important one would be: Which books or videos would I read/watch to learn more about say - the linkages in the back of this frame? Are the actuators 'vacuum actuators'? (after some googling of 'what is an actuator'? I came across 3 types, and the vacuum actuator seems to align closest to the design of this frame)

Are there any mechanical design books to read, or channels to watch on youtube?

956,56,Advice for choosing and Aerospace engineering program,1600302100,"Hello, I’ve posted similar threads in this sub and others and received some good advice from users, and it's getting close to when I need to make a decision on where to go to school so I’ve decided to post again and see if I can get some more good advice. I want to go to school for aerospace engineering, and if I were to work on the aeronautical side of things I would be completely satisfied, but I am more interested in the astronautical side of things. If I could pick any job in the world right now it would probably be at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on the Roman Space Telescope or in Texas working on SpaceXs Raptor Engine. 

I have gotten into Alaska Fairbanks, Colorado State, Iowa State, and New Mexico State but have basically decided against these schools either because they don’t actually have an aerospace program, or they seem isolated from the rest of the Aerospace industry. I have also decided against Alabama Huntsville despite its strong aerospace because if I wanted to live in the south I would prefer to go to Florida Tech.

Florida Tech is probably my favorite school of the ones I have got into. It is a small tech school, which is what I really wanted, and is focused on Aerospace. I would love to live next to KSC and watch the Vulcan, Falcon Heavy, and Artemis launches but the big problem is I don’t want to live in Florida. Simply put, I like deserts and mountains and Florida is the exact opposite. If I thought I would just go to class and only leave campus to get groceries I would probably choose Florida Tech but I want to be able to head up into the mountains or desert on the weekend.

I have looked into NM Tech and I love how small the school is but I don't know if they would have as many resources as a bigger school. They have 2 rocket test stands, and are close to White Sands and Spaceport America, but they don't actually have an aerospace major, just a minor. I know you don’t need a major to get into the Aerospace industry, I’m just not sure if it would have as much opportunity as ASU or CalPoly Pomona.

I have also got into the Arizona campus of Embry-Riddle, and it's another small aerospace focused school that seems great, but Prescott seems far from the Aerospace industry, and it seems more focused on the aeronautics side. 

I applied to 4 CalState schools and have got into CalPoly Pomona, and I don’t think I would choose any of the other 3 if they do accept me (San Diego State, San Jose State, CSU Long Beach). At first CPP was my top choice of the schools I’ve listed so far but I’m not sure if I would choose them over Arizona State. They are in Southern California, which I think is the biggest Aerospace center except for maybe Florida, and are extremely close to CalTech, my favorite university, and JPL. But even though they are a tech school they don’t seem to have as much of an aerospace focus as ASU. They only have an MS program, while ASU has a PhD. I have no clue if I'll want a PhD but I thought it was a good measure of how serious the school takes the program.  

I originally didn’t think much of Arizona State besides that there is a generic huge state school but after some commenters on a previous thread told me to take a second look I did and visited the school. I was impressed with how many NASA planetary missions they are involved with and the heavy duty focus the school seems to have on Aerospace and space exploration. I particularly liked their “School of Earth and Space Exploration” and while the AE program is of course in the Engineering college, I am interested in research opportunities or a minor through the SESE. Their AE program also offers an emphasis in Astronautics. While CPP seems like a better STEM school overall and a little more prestigious, ASU seems to have a more developed Aerospace program. I also got into University of Arizona but it just does not seem as good as ASU. 

At this point I am thinking it’s a choice between CPP and ASU, and I’m slightly favoring ASU. Like I said, after going through the SESE at ASU, I get the sense that space exploration is a real focus point at ASU, whereas it’s just another thing at CPP. But Southern California seems like the place to be for Aerospace. I get the feeling ASU has more opportunity on campus whereas CPP has more in a days commute.

I would love to go to one of the small tech schools I mentioned, Embry-Riddle, NM Tech, or Florida Tech. But the most important thing for me is going somewhere where I can make good connections in the industry, and get some real work as a RA or intern on a project that will be used in the real world, and I feel like ASU or CPP are the best two places for that. What do you guys think? Do I have the wrong impression of things? Should I look again at a college that I disregarded? 

I am still waiting on a response from CU Boulder and they will be my top choice if I get in, but I’m not counting on it. Thank you for your time.",AskEngineers,False,FormItUp,/r/AskEngineers/comments/iu8d8g/advice_for_choosing_and_aerospace_engineering/

961,61,Best way to perforate non woven fabric?,1600294842,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

A friend and I are working on a small project, which is to perforate non woven fabric through the help of rollers and a PLC to create smaller rolls of a 100 wipes, already precut for packaging. However, we have hit a wall upon trying to determine the best way of creating the perforations. We have seen there are helix blades that create the perforations as the material moves trough the mechanism, but the thing is, we have yet to find a part that is smaller than a meter in length and that does not come from China. On the other hand, we have seen some machines use pressure, although the material feed should be stopped as each cut is made, thus making it a slower process.

The fabric is unrolled with the help of a planar rubber band, synchronized to all the rollers in the mechanism that share the same sprockets, all joined by a chain and to the motor itself. Movement and tension is no longer an issue. We have pretty much finished the drafts but are yet to come up with the most crucial part. Any ideas are greatly, greatly appreciated.

I'm wondering if for plaster investment cast molds, if it is common, or possible to do over molding. Where there might be a steel part pre positioned in a mold cavity, then aluminum or brass is poured in.

Is this something that is done in industrial investment casting?

988,88,"Just got a gig consulting, questions on standard hiring practice",1600270032,"Hey everyone,

I've  had an LLC for a while set up if I ever found myself in a position  where I could do some consulting work on the side as I finish up my PhD.  I just got in contact with a startup that needs some RF engineering  help, and our goals lined up in that I could help them with some  part-time work.

After negotiating a  contract, the hiring company that this startup uses wants to run a full  background check, wants me to sit for a drug test, and wants me to sign  on to some pretty broad IP agreements. I was just wondering what is  standard for this kind of work. Is this unusual? This isn't for defense  or anything critical, just a small &lt;20 people hardware startup. Even  so, I don't know if I'm comfortable sitting in a LabCorp waiting room  for 2 hours, seems like not the place to be during a pandemic.

Also  is this typical for hiring an LLC? My understanding was that the LLC  was supposed to be a ""buffer"" between me the person and the ""company""  performing work. A lot of this hiring paperwork looks specific to a sole  proprietor or a single employee, not a company.",AskEngineers,False,activeXray,/r/AskEngineers/comments/itxpum/just_got_a_gig_consulting_questions_on_standard/
989,89,Just a venting CS grad,1600268746,"It's not popular to play the victim when concerning one's carrier but, there is a sense of needing a therapeutic moment of weakness in all this. Whether anyone reads this (due to its length), it feels good to put it all out there.      
That being said, my post:   
I've grown up in a small town in Missouri, the bastard son of a signal teenage mother who never married my father.  I'm in my mid-30s and thus was born in a time when deadbeat dads could get away with not paying child support, mine never did. We were poor. Add to that a string of drug issues my mother had in my early life and you can begin to understand how I and my half-brother found our way into the care of DFS. By the end of that, I would be taken in by my grandmother. My bother, on the other hand, wouldn't be my brother anymore (given up for adoption).   

  
My grandparents weren't like my mother ( who would later go to college and improve), they were hard-working upright middle-class folks. They raised me, as essentially, their third child.  I would eventually come to live with my mother again. Now improved she had an associate's degree and a job, but still couldn't make enough money to support us.    

  
It had become apparent that I struggled in school and so a round of progressive actions was taken. LD classes were followed by DB ones, and finally, the IEP's. These were seen as a good thing at the time, a way of lowering the standards for those children who couldn't ""keep up.""  What it really meant was that I was learning pre-algebra as a jr in high-school.   
Somewhere in the mix, I was put on minor disability by my mother, who despite me saying it was shameful, saw it was a way to supplement our low income and make a better life for me. I told myself at the time that I wouldn't stay on it after I became an adult, but when the time came, the security of it was too much to give up. I'm not proud of it, but there it is.  

   
I stayed on the check until 23 when a drunken fight on someone else's property landed me in jail. Although no one was really hurt I pled guilty to 2nd-degree assault (in MO a non-expugnable crime) in exchange for getting to go home that day and walking 3 years probation. I've never been drunk or violent before in my life, but, the one place I messed up would end up following me for the rest of my life.

     
When I began to explore how to rebuild my life I found most things out of reach. Felons, I learned cannot hold office, be a lawyer, work in the medical field, etc. One thing I kept coming back to was computer science, however.  I was told time and again that CS was the way to go if you had a record. That field was in such demand that many companies couldn't afford to care too much.   With all of my learning issues, I poured myself into learning this stuff. I started again at basic math and worked my way up ( as a grown man) to calculus. I did whatever I had to do to pass my classes. In this time I met the love of my life, inherited a home, and thought I was working my way toward something, a real life. It has taken me 7 years to get a 4 year CS degree.   
Now, the year of graduation, I find that my education has not given me everything I need.  I've no working knowledge of React, Angular, or really any framework outside of .net. I've no portfolio, nor the knowledge of Git or modern frameworks to make one. It would take me months or weeks to learn even one of these frameworks enough to make me competitive and even then, my age and record conspire against me. 

 COVID has robbed me of the one job I had (a web dev for a very small company), destroyed the economy that made me even remotely hirable, and now, my grandfather (essentially my father) lays dying of the same illness in the ICU.  To make matters worse, I now see that there is very little in this town for me. I, a diabetic, live in a hotspot area. And the board of health tried to pass a simple mask mandate last night, only to be met by throngs of protesting anti-maskers. Living in fear of my neighbors and the virus is not the way I want to live.  

 My dream? Go to Colorado. They have a 7-year rule there, and my record won't be such a big deal. Of course, to go I would need a job, and to get one I'd have to be competitive.  Which, I'm not.  The whole thing is just so much. Such a long journey and I'm still not even close to where I want to be. I'm tired...The whole mountain just seems far too high to climb.  It really hurts to know I've come all this way only to fail. To be in my mid-30's, have no children (because I didn't want them to be poor like me), and to realize that because I can't find a good job I likely never will. I've failed my wife and myself.
