6,Practical considerations for developing an automated hydraulic model,1595002666,"Hi All,

I am a water utility EI with almost enough experience for my PE and I have been recently tasked with developing a hydraulic model for our water utility. I've been approaching the task from a data perspective, developing scripts to automate the importation of shapefiles from our GIS data and flat tables that can then be loaded into the model (watermains, pumps, tanks, etc.). The scope of this is about 14,000 mains and about 25,000 nodes.

I've been running into typical roadblocks (inaccurate data, missing assets, etc.) and have been documenting what all needs to be updated in order to make this happen. I own several books on modeling and feel like I understand it well enough, but also feel that I am lacking a Computer Science background to really make this happen without paying a consultant. My goal is to make model generation a pushbutton effort, so that future updates can be automagically brought in.

Unfortunately, modeling efforts have been farmed out in the past so I do not have any peers that are knowledgeable about the details. My question is, are there any good practical resources for taking data, cleaning it up, and organizing it into a modeling effort? I'm thinking it doesn't have to be for hydraulics specifically, but just helping to understand some of the workflow needed and how to organize myself. If anyone has any advice for developing models or overcoming common challenges, I would certainly be eager to hear any advice. 

Also, am I in over my head? I am familiar with R for programming and thus far have been developing all my scripts in R because it can easily pull in and spit out different data types and is wonderful for GIS. Is that crazy?

Hey (respondent), 

I appreciate you taking time to correspond with me. I think speaking to someone in industry will be really beneficial. 

I wanted to speak to someone with your experience because my motivation for doing this interview is I am considering going back to school for a Mechanical Engineering degree. I currently have a bachelors in Manufacturing Engineering Technology, which placed more emphasis on things such as Six Sigma, Ergonomics, Project Management, etc. As a result, Statics and Mechanics of Materials was an upper level course for my program, and when I finally took those classes, I fell in love with the material and have a strong interest in the tools of design and engineering analysis now. Since I was so close to graduating though, I decided to finish the Tech degree and enter the industry. So the information you give me will help me weigh the pros and cons of going back to school or staying on my current path.  

1). For starters, tell me about yourself and what made you want to be in this industry?

2). What does your job in (XYZ) look like day to day or week to week? What tools and skills do you get to use there? What do you like best about your job? 

3). How often do you apply engineering design tools at work compared to time spent doing non-technical work?  

4). One of the tools I am interested in is Finite Element Analysis because of its power to solve engineering problems across multiple disciplines, and also seems to be the indispensable in stress, heat, and fluid analysis, but I have no one in my network that even seldom uses this tool in their jobs. Is FEA a tool that you have used, or know people in the industry that make use of FEA? If not, what level of analysis do you typically use to fulfill your job duties?

5). At my current employer, I know of 6 people in my position who were educated as mechanical engineers, but do not use many of the specialized skills they learn in school (we are more technical project managers). I am concerned that if I invest the time and money to get another degree, I may also be unable to find a job that allows me to use these skills. From an employer standpoint, I see it makes sense to hire a candidate with broad knowledge such as an ME, but as someone currently working in the design field, do you think that as time goes on there will be more or less opportunities for someone to work as an ME that is hired because of their speciality knowledge, or will the will trend be more towards hiring MEs because they are expected to be more flexible in their job duties as opposed to someone in the electrical or civil field?

24,Is important where you study (which universuty you go to) if you would like to work abroad?

I did a lot of research but I guess I still failed to figure how heavy this would be when done and it's already bowing a little in the middle. It's only a 4x6 beam. :-(  The options I came up with are, easiest to most difficult (IMHO), keeping in mind that this side of the structure is ""floating"" as it's not attached directly to the trees.

* Sister it with some 2x6s hoping the different grain pattern will add additional support. Nail and glue.
* Try to sister in a metal piece to give the beam rigidity. This seems plausible but I don't know enough to know how to do this.
* Add a turnbuckle to the center going up to the tree ([https://www.treehousesupplies.com/3\_4\_x\_18\_Turn\_Buckle\_Jaw\_Jaw\_p/tb3-4x18.htm](https://www.treehousesupplies.com/3_4_x_18_Turn_Buckle_Jaw_Jaw_p/tb3-4x18.htm)). I could add two, one going up each way but this would affect the tree/house connection.
* Add knee braces ([https://www.treehousesupplies.com/Knee\_Brace\_Bracket\_1\_25\_p/br-1.25knee45.htm](https://www.treehousesupplies.com/Knee_Brace_Bracket_1_25_p/br-1.25knee45.htm)) but again would then connect the structure to the tree.
* Add a support post under it in the center. Not ideal, would kill the ""treehouse"" look and might shift when the treehouse moves (floating structure).
* Jack up the structure and replace the wood beam with metal or a sandwiched wood beam. This sounds difficult and dangerous though.

57,Protected Left Turn Signal Not Turning Yellow - City Traffic Tech Says This is Working as Intended?,1594945823,"TL;DR In the US, is it ever valid for a protected left turn signal (GREEN ARROW) to **not** then display a clearance interval left signal (YELLOW ARROW)?

Details:

Hello group! I apologize in advance if this is not the right place, or if the terminology is incorrect. I'm a regular Joe who's on an info kick :) I tried to search online for the answer but no dice.

I travel through a 4-way intersection that has protected left turn signals. In the past (and as far as I have experienced in my home state, and elsewhere in the US), protected left turn signals will illuminate GREEN for a X-time, then change to YELLOW (the clearance interval I believe?) for Y-time, and then disappear, or becoming ""not protected.""

About three years ago, I noticed that the YELLOW turn arrow (the clearance interval) was no longer illuminating after the GREEN protected left turn signal. I figured the YELLOW LEDs must be broken. I emailed my city government (who forwarded to the traffic dept.). The response was along the lines of ""We can't see any issues."" This ticked me off but I'm sort of apathetic and lazy so I did nothing.

Until yesterday!

Since the original contact to my gov't three years ago, another left turn YELLOW clearance signal and normal GREEN signal were no longer illuminating. I had some extra time and filmed all three signals, including both left turn signals going from GREEN/Protected to nothing (not illuminated). To help my cause, I included directional maps, commentary, dates, etc. I posted this on our local ""fix issue"" website that the government monitors, and sent the same message directly to the town's traffic technician. My goal was to have these signals reverted to the original pattern I remembered. GREEN ARROW, YELLOW ARROW, GREEN NORMAL TRAFFIC SIGNALS, etc...

The gov't acknowledged the ticket pretty quickly. However...

A traffic tech posted the regular GREEN LED was out - great! But, the traffic tech also said the protected left turn signals are ""working correctly"" and that ""once the green arrow goes away, the intersection flows in both directions.""

W...what? In all my years of driving I have never seen a GREEN ARROW go to NOTHING. It always goes GREEN ARROW, YELLOW ARROW, then either GREEN SOLID CIRCLE or RED ARROW.

To help illustrate the underlying issue, here's a small animation I made showing what's happening:

[https://imgur.com/a/nFNwzs4](https://imgur.com/a/nFNwzs4) 

AND...an actual video of the issue:

[https://youtu.be/v6xA\_hBsZpk](https://youtu.be/v6xA_hBsZpk)

So, personally, I find the traffic tech's explanation hard to believe. I have experienced, both in a vehicle and as a pedestrian, the GREEN arrow going away, and the opposite flow of traffic sitting there (seemingly for the YELLOW clearance interval to complete) for about 4-5 seconds before advancing. This is however difficult to prove (I'd need two cameras, and some other logistical issues...).

If it would help I can provide more location data. That said, I would assume these types of signals would be somewhat standardized nationwide.

My question is...who's right? Is this some new traffic pattern that's valid or does my town have some lazy/cheap techs? A combo? Am I'm wrong in my thinking? To me, it seems somewhat dangerous as it is since drivers *think* the yellow arrow is broken and just keep trying to sneak through before the opposite flow can go.

64,Is automation only a buzz word that doesn't help in improving the plant?,1594938072," I wanted to write a document on implementing automation into a manufacturing plant but ended up comming to an unexpected conclusion instead. Tl;dr at the end.

**How to automate a production plant**

1. NFC chips in raw material and NFC chip reader under material handling trolley to scan it. This is an automatic material entry into the ERM (Enterprise Resource Manager) system with location, quantity, material, etc.
2. Also, use RFID tag/reader.
3. Have pressure-sensitive or laser sensor for checking if the material is in the racks and when it is withdrawn.

The above ideas are horrible because they only take into account the tracking of material through the plant. The above steps also ignore the cost of implementation, as a better, cleaner, simpler solutions can be implemented. 

To write this paper, I will first need to decide what this paper wants to convey. Is it  “How to build a fully automated manufacturing plant”, which means the manufacturing plant will not have any employees. Or is it going to be “How to convert a manufacturing plant into an automated manufacturing plant”, this is going to be more widely helpful as there are multiple pre-existing manufacturing plants but this “automation” will most likely be “the robots in Alex Rogo’s plant”, they will increase the operation expanses as we can’t fire people and the “automation” won’t increase the sales/throughput, it will only improve the “efficiency” (I internally cringe as I write that sentence). 

The problem is I want to fuse automation into a manufacturing plant, but it’s done only for the sake of being futuristic. Now that I know the problem, I can very easily solve it, **I just need to either increase the throughput, and decrease inventory and operational expenses.**

Thus, automation in a manufacturing plant needs to work towards “The Goal” (of making money).

Can automation increase sales?

Can automation reduce inventory?

Can automation decrease operational expenses?

Doubtful, maybe, quite the opposite.

Lets elaborate, I cannot see a way where automation can increase sales, it can increase the production rate but so can purchasing more machines. Inventory can be reduced in a way, by decreasing the cycle time of a process, we can make the process more “reliable”, so we will need less inventory (but only inventory against errors, safety stock, etc.). Automation will most definitely increase the operational expenses, as we cannot fire employees. Thus automation only helps in making a process more reliable.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Automation can only improve safety, speed, reliability of a process and inturn of the overall plant but doesn't help in being more profitable, so automation should be used only for safety, speed, reliability reasons and not be implemented for the heck of it and expect things to improve.",AskEngineers,False,Truly_Edge,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hsjqi6/is_automation_only_a_buzz_word_that_doesnt_help/

I'm a big fan of Michael Reeves and his videos and bc of that wanted to start small projects to get into robotics/electro engineering. I don't have any experience with electro engineering what so ever and I'm currently in my first semester of computer science.

My idea for my first project was to build something to automate my curtains to open at a specific time in the morning. I quickly realised that without any help its gonna be a real struggle to figure out how I can achieve something like that. The base concept I thought about was to get a motor that has a rope attached to it, which Is also attached to the curtain and can pull it to close/open the curtains.

I didn't figure out which kind of motor I can use for that, I bought a small one from a store for remote controlled cars its called: Absima 80T Brushed, on the back it says Thrust B-Spec is 2310079 80 T.  
I'm not sure tho if it is fit for the purpose of the project , if it has enough power etc, since its quite a big curtain.  
I've seen in some videos and other projects from people on the internet that you can program Arduino's and raspberry pi's to control the power for motors. I have no idea tho how to exactly do that, and what is a good fit for my problem.  
I know it are a lot of I don't knows and that explaining everything is to much to ask for, but it would be really helpful if I can get some directions on where to get information fit for the idea and maybe what kind of motor would work and what the beginner friendliest tool is to program something like that.

89,Bioengineer looking for radical career change,1594909618,"Hi all,

I am currently registered in a Masters Program in Bioengineering at EPFL in Switzerland, and I am getting close to finishing my studies. I have absolutely no interest in any of the courses that I have chosen, I already made two attempts to switch fields by going into Mathematics or Computer Science, but I didn't find fulfilment in those fields either.

I am doing okay academically, so I  think that I will manage to get to the end of my Masters degree, however I am absolutely lost as to what career path I might pursue afterwards. I have no professional experience but I have to do an internship to complete my studies. I am currently looking for one.

So my first question for the short term is the following: Do you have any ideas of a field to work in that kind of matches my profile? Or a company in particular that is susceptible to offer a really good first experience in the professional world? I am very flexible and I wouldn't mind to work almost anywhere else in the world.

My second question is the most important one, as it focuses more on the long term: Considering your own experiences, do you think that I have a chance to find work that I will like with my profile or do you think that I am better off if I start over by studying another field entirely? I have been considering studying Industrial Design, as it seems a good opportunity to use a few engineering skills but in a much more creative mindset.

My interests outside of my studies are sports, cooking, cinema, arts in general and design. Also, I would like to work for a rather small company, preferably no industry giants.

One of the most common questions asked by people looking into a career in engineering is, *""What do engineers actually do?*"" or, *""What's an average day like for an engineer?""* While these questions may appear simple, they're a gateway to a vast amount of information. Much of the info available on the net is too vague or abstract to be helpful, and often fails to describe anything specific about engineering work.

To offer practical and actionable info, AskEngineers hosts this annual Work Experience Thread where engineers can talk about their daily job activities and career in general. This series has been successful in guiding students towards the best major for them, and helping engineers better understand what their counterparts in other disciplines do.

Today's thread is for engineers who want to share their stories, advice, and collective knowledge with our community. The responses here will be archived in the AskEngineers wiki and made available as a public resource.

3,Calculating motor power and torque for a given payload at a fixed length and rotational rate,1594883856,"I recently took on a project as an electrical engineering consultant and there are a few requirements that I understand, at least conceptually, but I have long since forgotten how to do the calculations. I made the customer aware of this up front and it's not an issue as I'm most likely going to sub the work to someone else. However, I am frustrated that I can't figure it out, so here I am asking for help.

I have distilled this into a simpler version of the real problem. In short, how much motor torque and power are required to rotate a 5 kg mass at 1 m once per second? The idea is to hang a 5 kg weight on a fixed arm with a length of 1 m and it is parallel with the plane of the earth. The issue I'm having is tying the moment of inertia to the motor power requirement based on the rotational acceleration.

Said another way, I am asking myself questions that I can't answer without developing a better intuition for this type of problem. E.g.:

* How much power is required to spin the 5 kg payload at 1 m?
* How long does it take to accelerate to full speed?
* How fast can the same motor/power spin a 1 kg payload at 0.5 m?
* etc. etc.

My first thought was mounting anchors on the inside to mount varying shapes of nylon fabric or some kind of woven fabric. Then I considered that the pressure of someone waking on it would put stress on the walls around it, or the gaps between the fabric would be dangerous, or that the mounting system wouldn’t align right in general.

Every one I’ve talked to has said it’s the same, I even looked at the US Bureau of labor statistics the median incomes are only a couple hundreds difference, and the median income for students at my school for both are the same as well.

19,"What is the most economic way to build a 15m diameter, 5.5m deep pool?",1594866169,"Hello! 

I'm trying to find the most economic solution to building a large circular pool. (15 meter diameter, 5.5 meter depth). The pool can be either below or above ground. From what I understand, I believe the best direction will be an aboveground concrete pool. Considering this I hired an engineer from Fivver to create a first iteration of the structural drawings. After completion of the concept I ran these structural drawings by another experienced pool resource who felt there might be some structural flaws. I have no idea what's what, a lot of the language in the structural drawings is completely foreign to me. I'm not sure if it will hold up or not. At this point I feel the best option is to connect with a reputable engineer or firm that could help steer the project in the right direction. So if anyone has advice or could connect me with someone who could help on this project it would be greatly appreciated. 

[Structural drawings from Fivver engineer](http://www.cliffdiving.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Structural-Drawings-copy.pdf)

**Other important points of the design:**

\-Can be as simple as possible - no jets, no drains, no filters, no lights necessary - if it's easier to run pvc up and over the side of the pool for filtration thats o.k. 

\-Pool will need to have a large tower next to it as seen in the drawings, the concrete base of that tower will be very much like the base of a large tower crane

**I've also explored a couple other options which I believe are most likely more expensive:** 

\-Rain water collection tank, typically made from curved sections of corrugated metal on a concrete slab. [example](https://www.tank-depot.com/p-3865/rain-harvesting-steel-tanks) 

\-Steel paneled tank - I've been told most likely won't be the most economic solution considering the additional support for the steel walls and the liner for a pool of this size

Worse case scenario is to use electromagnets that can have a permanent state (magnetized or not magnetized)  without consuming energy other than for switching between those stages ( I think those exist dont they? ) 

Point being I want to avoid using electricity unless there absolutely no other way but dont mind to use pedals etc 

Imagine like a funnel resting on the floor filled with small metallic (or magnetic doesnt matter ) balls and a tube connected to it ""sucking"" balls from one end (continuously or randomly also doesnt matter) and spitting them out at the other. 

Also speed doesnt matter I dont want to make a gauss canon they could ""flow"" from the tube slowly (within reason like I wouldnt want them to move out like 1 small ball every day or something like that :P )

A) is this possible?  If not why not?

Well, months later I'm finally about to have my degree on my academic official record so I can send it to LADWP and be placed back on the candidates list for a second interview.

1) Is it likely I'll still get a second interview despite months having been passed since the first opportunity?

2) Is it okay to take the software company position, but leave after only 1 or 2 months if LADWP offers me the position? Since its contract, I'm not sure if this is possible. I'll have to look into it a bit more.

33,Career/Industry options for a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate with a sleep disorer,1594848998,"Hi Reddit, 

TL;DR at the bottom 

I'm 25 and recently graduated with an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from a top engineering school in the US in May of 2020 and am currently in search of employment.
Aside from hiring freezes due to Covid-19, a major obstacle I've encountered during my job search is that I have a sleep disorder called delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD). In short DSPD is a neurological disorder that causes my circadian rhythm to be pushed hours ahead of a normal person's circadian rhythm. A normal person may naturally fall asleep at 10 or 11pm and naturally wake up at 6 or 7 am- well I naturally fall asleep hours later at 4 or 5 am and wake up at around 12 pm if like permits me to. The disorder itself is characterized by my inability to shift my circadian rhythm back to match with societies expectations. It can be considered a disability. 
It is a rare sleep disorder and most people have never heard of it so for more information about the disorder here's a link: https://www.circadiansleepdisorders.org/docs/DSPS-QandA.php

I was diagnosed after participating in a sleep study by a neurologist who specialized in sleep medicine. I have tried every available treatment for DSPD, maintained good sleep hygiene practices, light therapy, chronotherapy, never eat late, never exercise late, blue light blocking glasses at night, etc. The gist is that I'll most likely be stuck with this sleep disorder for life and in order to not be sleep deprived and miserable every day I need to sleep when my body tells me to- which creates major conflict with the typical 9-5 job. 

As a consequence my goal is to find a second shift job(12pm to 8 or 9 pm) that utilizes my degree. From what research I have done I've found that there are an abundance of technician jobs (which don't require a degree), but there are very limited options that do requires degrees- and I also read that the positions that are available for those shifts are usually dead end jobs because you have very little face time and interaction with your boss. 

Could anyone point me to resources and/or mechanical engineering career paths that will allow me to work second shift hours? Any advise would be appreciated.

Some more background: 
Building a trashcan that is a dodecahedron and I want to make it one of those nifty automated ones. EE background so I'm comfortable with the electronics, but I'm a little lost as to how to accomplish what I want physically. If the trashcan is sitting on one face, the opening is one of the faces that is facing up/forward, that face will be split into two halves and when it opens I want one half to go into the can on the right side and the other half to go in the opposite side, figure I'll use a garage door style, so the two halves will be made from vertical wooden slats with hinges on the back and move along a T rail that is on the inside of the can on standoffs 1-3 inches from the inner wall of the trash can so the ""door"" halves can slide and fit between the wall and the T rail. Hoping to curve the T rail along the inner perimeter of the can so I can get away with just using one motor to control both halves, the motor would be located directly oppose this face on the opposite wall. Hopefully that's clear, always have difficulty explaining stuff like this.

Question 1: What is a good way to get this ""door"" to move in/out of position? Are there some terms I can look into? I can think of an easy way of pulling the doors sideways with a motor and string or equivalent, but getting it back seems difficult. Not sure what the mechanism for this would be besides maybe a bunch of gears, which I'm not opposed to but I don't know how that would work on a curved rail (also not married to the idea of a rail, just got caught up with the garage door design)

Question 2: if the door slides into the can to open up, it would be easiest if it was inset a bit so it doesn't collide with the side walls. Would it be possible to have it push forward to look more natural? I have a few ideas on this but they all seem kind of janky and I haven't thought them through enough to write clearly. 

Note: keep saying 'can' because this will be a trashcan, but the shape is not a cylinder, felt weird writing it but couldn't think of an alternative word and didn't wanna keep writing dodecahedron.",AskEngineers,False,PhysicalChess,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hrvdex/door_mechanism_design_help/

Hey (respondent), 

I appreciate you taking time to correspond with me. I think speaking to someone in industry will be really beneficial. 

I wanted to speak to someone with your experience because my motivation for doing this interview is I am considering going back to school for a Mechanical Engineering degree. I currently have a bachelors in Manufacturing Engineering Technology, which placed more emphasis on things such as Six Sigma, Ergonomics, Project Management, etc. As a result, Statics and Mechanics of Materials was an upper level course for my program, and when I finally took those classes, I fell in love with the material and have a strong interest in the tools of design and engineering analysis now. Since I was so close to graduating though, I decided to finish the Tech degree and enter the industry. So the information you give me will help me weigh the pros and cons of going back to school or staying on my current path.  

1). For starters, tell me about yourself and what made you want to be in this industry?

2). What does your job in (XYZ) look like day to day or week to week? What tools and skills do you get to use there? What do you like best about your job? 

3). How often do you apply engineering design tools at work compared to time spent doing non-technical work?  

4). One of the tools I am interested in is Finite Element Analysis because of its power to solve engineering problems across multiple disciplines, and also seems to be the indispensable in stress, heat, and fluid analysis, but I have no one in my network that even seldom uses this tool in their jobs. Is FEA a tool that you have used, or know people in the industry that make use of FEA? If not, what level of analysis do you typically use to fulfill your job duties?

5). At my current employer, I know of 6 people in my position who were educated as mechanical engineers, but do not use many of the specialized skills they learn in school (we are more technical project managers). I am concerned that if I invest the time and money to get another degree, I may also be unable to find a job that allows me to use these skills. From an employer standpoint, I see it makes sense to hire a candidate with broad knowledge such as an ME, but as someone currently working in the design field, do you think that as time goes on there will be more or less opportunities for someone to work as an ME that is hired because of their speciality knowledge, or will the will trend be more towards hiring MEs because they are expected to be more flexible in their job duties as opposed to someone in the electrical or civil field?

* What are some favorite online marketplaces for linking up with clients?
* Is most of the available work 3D and 2D specific, or are there opportunities for new product development and consulting?
* Would a Solidworks professional certification help my appeal?
* How has the market changed with COVID? Is it saturated
* Did you set up an LLC?

48,Thrusting Machine Final Touches [NSFW],1594841680,"Okay so I posted a question awhile ago asking for help with a diy sex machine and got a fair bit of help. I've decided to go with a 130vdc motor/speed regulator set up and use a flywheel. If I'm correct, I need a 13 inch diameter flywheel at least for a 12 inch stroke length? I've heard every inch on the flywheel will translate to either one or two inches of stroke length so I'm not sure which is true. The biggest hang ups I have right now are connecting to the fly wheel (rod end bearing?) and the exact joint I need to connect the driving rod to the linear rod. I thought about a u-joint but I'm not sure it would be the best option. The rod end bearing I'm thinking female with 3/8th inch threads so I can use a male threaded rod for both the joint/hinge and bearing. 

Questions:

1. Will each inch away from the center of the flywheel translate to one or two inches of stroke length?
2. Best connection to translate from rotary to linear motion?

62,In a car with manual transmission does it hurt my baby to switch between gears that dont have synchronizers between them?,1594830524,"So my understanding is that there are synchronizers between:

-The 2nd and 3rd gear
-The 3rd and 4th gear
-The 4th and 5th gear

So for example if I switch from 3rd to 2nd I disengage the clutch, shift the shifter to 2nd, blip the throttle to bring the engine to more or less 2nd gear RPMs, engage the clutch.

But, when I switch from 3rd to 5th or viceversa or 2nd to 1st (not much torque on low RPMs and 8000 redline so sometimes I feel like I have to) the gear doesnt go in easily if I do it in that order. Instead I have to wait for the engine RPMs to drop when switching from 3rd to 5th, or when downshifting blip the throttle BEFORE I use the shifter, even though the clutch is disengaged.

So am I right to assume that this happens because there are no synchros between between those gears? Should I avoid doing it because of wear and tear or is it not a big issue if I rev match correctly? The rev matching wont be as accurate since I have to do it before putting the gear in.

Or maybe Im just doing it wrong??",AskEngineers,False,heyredditimadeanacc,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hrqrcc/in_a_car_with_manual_transmission_does_it_hurt_my/

90,Any engineers out there that didn't begin with a maths/science background?,1594789861,"Hi guys,

I (21 F) am planning on studying engineering, however I have always leaned heavily toward humanities and english based subjects.

My boyfriend (27 M) is a civil engineer and since he's been WFH i've realised how interesting his work seems  to me. I've since spoken to a few other engineering friends (mechanical) and think I would enjoy the job at the end of the degree but know I will struggle getting through the degree itself. I don't know what type of engineering interests me at this stage but the first year is the same for all specialties so I can decide later.

For context, I have almost finished (1 semester left) an undergraduate in commerce majoring in economics and have completed one year of law as I initially studied this as a double degree. I always planned on becoming a lawyer and have recently decided the long hours, toxic work environments and low pay is really not what I want.

I stopped science in year 10 and the highest maths I have is 3AB/3CD (maths methods, I did well in this unit). I've always excelled academically and I work hard, but I appreciate humanities/english based subjects and science/maths based subjects are very different skills. To enter engineering I will have to complete a 2 year diploma as a bridging course for the undergraduate eng units and 2 years of masters.

So, my questions are:

How do I decide if engineering will be a good fit? All I see everywhere is if you're good at maths and science and if you like understanding how things work engineering will be a good fit for you. I've always thought i'd end up in a humanities type career so I haven't given myself time to explore this and like a lot of girls I didn't grow up tinkering with things, so I just don't know.

How do I decide if i'll get through the degree? Next semester I'm doing physics and maths (equivalent to specialist). Other than this, how can I know?

Any other advice or options I should consider?

Thanks in advance!

I have always loved flight, planes and space travel has been my favorite subject since I was little. Now that I'm faced with the decision on what type of engineer I want to be I'm faced with a tough decision. I personally don't think I would find much joy in aerospace engineering because as much as I like CAD I can't see myself designing screws and minor parts for a career.

I’m [26F, Mech Eng] two years into my first engineering position, and I feel like I’ve hit my stride almost too quickly compared to others in my position?  I’m landing major projects and deliverables within my first year and getting involved in every area.  I’m getting my MBA.  I have a lot of visibility with upper management, an open communication with my manager about wanting to become a manager, and I feel pretty confident nowadays.   Almost a little... well. Cocky and comfortable and bored.

To be honest it’s not fun being someone who now knows things.  I like constantly learning things about the business and about my role/group (manufacturing engineering, operations).  I like being on the younger side, having a mentor rather than being one.  But my group is made up of young people like me, high turnover, not a lot of senior people.

I also really love the department I work in.  Operations, Manufacturing is my soul.  I can’t stand being stuck behind a desk not able to be hands on or interact with the ground-force.

I like being the person who can make the hard decisions and help pave a path for smarter people than me to get things done.

5,What to do after taking a job I absolutely hate as a new grad?,1594772660,"Hey guys,

I graduated in May and accepted a job as a Field Service Engineer a month later. I chose to accept the offer because it's close to home with good benefits. I had other offers and more interviews coming up, but I believed this was the best choice at the time because the benefits at the other companies weren't that great and I was worried about a possible unemployment gap if I didn't succeed in my other  interviews.

I've been at the job for 1 month so far and it's not something that I see myself doing longterm. I feel more like a technician than an actual Engineer. I haven't used any of the material that I've learned in school and will probably not be using that knowledge in the upcoming future. All I do is install and repair tools following procedures. When I try to go above and beyond to do more than what is needed for this position so I can learn, my boss is not happy and tells me to just find a procedure and do things the ""easy way"" instead which is demotivating. I'm also beginning  to get frustrated at my boss constantly micromanaging and asking for updates every hour.

I want to start looking again, but I'm afraid other companies will see a red flag since I've only been at this company for a month. Can this experience make it harder to switch into a different engineering position if I stay too long?

6,Help starting a project for a pulley system on the side of my family's house,1594772306,"Hi everyone! Full disclosure that I originally posted this on r/engineering, but someone recommended me here.

So I'm nineteen and currently living with my mom, grandmother, and my mom's boyfriend. My mother and nana are both disabled, and our house has quite a few steps to get into our house, and another ten or so in a super cramped stairwell. As such, getting things like groceries or bags of trash in and out of the house is really difficult, and I normally wind up doing most of it, especially since my grandfather died last month. Hopefully though, I'll be moving out within the next year to live on my college campus (virus permitting, obviously), and I'd hate to leave them having to strain themselves too much.

So I got to thinking, and right below the window in our living room is clear to the ground, and I thought it might be possible to build some kind of pulley system (I'm thinking like an old-timey dumbwaiter, except outside) to bring things in and out of the house. They could put things going in the house on the platform, go inside, and hit a button to bring it up.

For reference, I took AP Physics 2 in high school and might be making physics or engineering my major, so I thought this would be a good project to do to see if I want to change my major too.

8,Is there anywhere good to learn about designing mechanisms and getting actuators to cause the kind of motion I want?,1594769004,"I've recently become interested in the YouTube channel Stuff Made Here. He makes a lot of devices with steppers and servos and such, with various pushrods to get the type of motion he's looking for.

In my experience, I struggle to make successful mechanisms - things end up flopping around, or there is too much force in other directions to get the thing to properly open.

Like, let's say I have a small box with a hinged lid, and I want that lid to pop open. I get a spring-loaded hinge, and I attach a latch like this on the front of the box: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yWl4fanbL._AC_.jpg

So on the body of the box, I'd have a servo with the rotating hook, and it would be basically a pin holding the lid down. The servo is supposed to turn and pull the hook out, releasing the lid, popping the lid open.

But when I build it, I find that the spring pushing the lid open puts too much cross-force on the latch mechanism, so the servo can't turn the hook because it's all bound up.

I'm sure there is a better way to design this type of mechanism. Where can I learn to do that better?

23,Would pursuing a career in medical devices or pharmaceuticals be better long term? (Need help deciding my bioengineering concentration),1594753721,"I am currently a rising third year bioengineering student at Northeastern University and am trying to figure out what concentration I want to pursue.

Here's my thought process so far:

The options I have are med devices, cell and tissue engineering, bioimaging/signal processing, and biomechanics. I don't really have an interest in the bioimaging concentration so that narrows it to three. I heard from upperclassmen that biomechanics doesn't have much of a career path outside of academia (I'd rather be in industry), so if this statement is true, that narrows it down to two. (Is the assumption that biomechanics leads to academia research as a career true?)

That would narrow it down to two. What I'm trying to figure out now is if I want to pursue a med device concentration and go into those or if I want to pursue cell/tissue engineering and go into a drug development company (like Merck or Takeda or a start-up). I had the opportunity to co-op at a start-up therapeutic company and it was a good experience overall. Not sure if that is really what I want to do though. I know in that field you would usually need to get a masters/PhD. I am ok getting a masters, but a PhD is not something I really want to get.

I guess what I am asking is what are the pros/cons of the two options in terms of careers? Which do you think would be a better career long-term? If you work in one of these two fields of bioengineering, do you enjoy it?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my thoughts so far:

Med Devices Pros- Higher starting salary (from what I've researched), no push to get a masters/PhD, seem to be less moving around in terms of jobs (not sure if it is true, again, just from what I've researched), companies in Boston (where I go to school and where I want to live after college), I like programs like SolidWorks (not much to go off of, but that's better than not liking it)

Med Devices Cons- Don't have experience working in this field, not sure if I'd like it (still willing to try though!)

Cell/tissue Pros- Have some experience in this field already, LOTS of companies in boston, I seem to have a slightly greater interest in bio than material science, I like the aspect of moving around during the day in a lab

Cell/tissue Cons- People seem to move jobs more often, may need to get a masters (only one extra year, not a huge deal), not a huge fan of having to constantly read literature (may be mainly due to my lack of understanding of material in it though (since I have only taken 1 bio class so far))

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if there are a lot of grammar errors. This has been a spewing of thoughts and I completely understand if there is a lot of confusion based on things I've written here.

It looks like their tolerance is not very good (expected, considering the welding arc moves a lot) and in photos that they've posted on Twitter it looks like they grind the tank smooth afterward. As far as I can tell, there are 4 considerations:    

1) Strength: the 3D-printed tank will likely be weaker than the machined one because it's not as uniform (stress concentrations at layer boundaries?)   
2) Weight: probably similar    
3) Cost: seems like the 3D-printed part would use slightly less material, but you also have to pay for specialized machinery and to run a 1-2kW welder for a week continuously   
3) Time: they said it takes a week to print the tank, and then it probably takes some time to grind it afterward, so maybe 10 days total. That seems like more than enough time to machine a tank.

My wife and I had been dreaming about relocating from the Midwest to Washington D.C/Maryland/Virginia area for a little while now.

I'm searching for EE Design Engineer roles in the greater DC area, but about all I see is MEP/Construction or Defense sector jobs; I don't know the first thing about these sectors, so not sure how I would sell my self in an interview even if I applied.

41,Young Engineers First Full Time Job Decision,1594740079,"Job Decision

Hello all, I am in need of some outside opinions on some job choices.
To start I’m currently still a student working on my Mechanical Engineering degree and will graduate this December.
I had an internship with a job offered when I graduate with a nice $63,000 salary and a $3000 sign on bonus. The job wasn’t anything too involved in engineering but it was within some realm of it. I enjoyed it but I got laid off due to COVID-19.
So I started looking for internships/full time jobs. 
I’ve found 4 so far, a couple are very similar and 2 are different.

The first job I got offered was in tool design engineering, but I have to wait for the market to pick up and I nor the manager knows when that will happen (Aerospace). I have no idea about benefits nor salary but it seems like a nice place to work at, close to home and school.

The second job is also for tool design engineering but it’s further away from home, pays 25$ an hour with health insurance and all that Jazz. Tool design isn’t my dream job but I do somewhat enjoy doing it.

The third job, I haven’t been offered a job exactly but it is for design engineering further away from home, but it starts out as a contract job until I graduate and then turns into full time. It pays 21$ an hour and I think I may like this more than tool design as it involves more engineering and problem solving.

The last job is for an Engineering Technician for press manufacturing, it involves both design and hands on work which I like but the bummer is that it only pays 19$ an hour with benefits, it seems like a great job to work at with some room to grow but I honestly balked at that low of a salary. They strung me along for about a month and said multiple times they have a competitive salary, which to me seems false.

None of these jobs are truly my “dream job” but the contract job is the closest to it. Am I better off taking the highest salary and finding a better job when the market improves or to take the job I might like the most?

TLDR: Have 4 jobs to choose from, none are my dream job but the highest paying is my least favorite (I still somewhat enjoy the work).",AskEngineers,False,markistador147,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hr3frj/young_engineers_first_full_time_job_decision/

So i've just watched some videos of paul mcworther (a very succesful engineer - had very high positions at important companies) and I wanted to ask for more opinions. He said that in order to get to the top of your game (in engineering), you need to work hard in college (of course, i agree with this) and you should have no distractions. And by no distractions he means no alcohol, no parties, no girlfriend. This is where I'm not very sure if he's right. I mean, yeah, I want to be a very succesful engineer and I am ready to work hard for that, but shouldn't I also have a good social life? I don't mean going out 4 times a week, no. But going out once a week on a friday or saturday night and take dinner or go clubbing with your friends. Maybe drink some beers on this kind of occasions (no exaggeration of course). Besides that, should I really be a virgin until a finish college (until 25-26 years old)? I mean, mistakes and love relationships are our best teachers, aren't they? Of course, some relationships may be toxic and get in the way of you learning for college, but if you have a good relationship or you're just going around dating girls, isn't this a good way to develop your personality or improve yourself as a person? Aren't these kinds of things also important in life and for your career? 

If there are any succesful engineers here, in order to get to this point, did you really neglect your social or love life? Isn't it ok to have hobbies (dance, playing guitar) and improve on those too or have a loving and great relationship with an awesome girl? Isn't it ok to experiment as many things as you can in your free time and make new friends and connections (even if they are not in the engineering field)?

I am an ME planning to move to the US, and am wondering what options would be available for me.

\-3.5 years of experience in the construction industry, under a main contractor. Work has been in the Arabian Gulf region (Qatar). The majority of the standards and codes used here are the BS and EN ones. Projects that I've worked for were commercial buildings, hospitals, and pumping stations.

With the aforementioned quals, what would be the career options for me? (even if outside of engineering). What are some resources that could help with the shift between codes and standards?

Would the experience that I have be of any use in the US? Would passing the FE exam help my case?

My current title at my employer is Sr Engineering Technician within our Process Engineering department. I have only been in this role for four months. We mainly run a thermoforming process although we have some processes that are strictly RF and some Injection molding. I am getting close to graduating school, however I am getting a B.S. in Business Management. I pursued this degree before I got this engineering job and I'm finishing this fall.

Now that I am in engineering, I am beginning to think long term as far as how this degree can help or hurt me in the future. So here is my question. 

There are many engineers within our company that have made it to PE I, PE II, Senior PE I, etc. positions over the course of their careers without any degrees. The next step past those positions would be Engineering Management, provided you have the right amount of experience. My question lies with the ""Do you have an Engineering Degree"" portion of the application. I realize I only have a Business Degree so would you, as a hiring manager, take someone with a Business Degree with many years of engineering experience, into consideration for a management position?

I have thought about pursuing a Masters in Engineering Management just so I can check the box down the line, (I am only 23 at this point) so I have plenty of time, however that is assuming I can even get accepted into a MEM degree program. Many programs say they evaluate on a case by case basis, for non engineer BS degree holders, so I would hope that some day with enough professional experience and good references, I could get accepted into a program like this. But I want to assume that I never get my MEM and end up applying to an Engineer Manager position 10 or 15 years from now with just a bachelors in Business. What are your thoughts?

I am new to reddit.  I have BS degrees in EE and physics and a masters in EE specializing in semiconductor devices.  However, I live and work in and area where there is hardly any semiconductor industry (Detroit) and I have decided to get into the automotive industry instead.  Since graduating in 2008 with my BS I have had a rough go and dropped in and out of grad schools the last 10 years several times until finally getting my masters.  I have about 7.5 years of experience doing various engineering jobs but none have really satisfied my technical itch so to speak.  

I really want to get into automotive control systems (think autonomous vehcles, electric vehicles, etc) and my alma mater offers a control specialization in an MS Mech E program.  It seems perfect since it is geared toward automotive and it is at my alma mater.  I have also essentially already been accepted but I am now getting cold feet.  It is a lot of money (35k total) and will take 3-4 years.  Also, my current employer doesn’t offer tuition assistance but that could change if I change employers.  

I have had a really rough time convincing people to hire me despite having a masters in EE, some decent experience (even if not totally relevant to the jobs I want to get), good grades, and a dual major in EE and physics.  Life isn’t always fair to everyone and I have had my fair share of struggles the last few years.  

I really want to try learning some things about mechanical engineering though.  I think it would be fun but I am 35 and not getting any younger.  I also currently live with my parents and will probably be 40 still living with the parents when I finish this masters...

My dream is to work in academia and get a PhD but I think that ship has sailed.  I have dropped out of two PhD programs in my lifetime now and still regret it.  I just think the MSME will satisfy my curiosity and will get me a good job as a controls engineer.

What do you all think?  Good idea or no?  If not, how do you suggest I get into the automotive controls engineering area otherwise?  No controls experience means no controls job.  No controls job means no controls experience.  I hope getting a masters in ME will break that catch 22 and help me get my foot in the door somewhere.",AskEngineers,False,SemiconductorGuy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hqsabm/should_an_ee_do_a_masters_in_me/

Be it as part of an external antenna on a desktop or an internally routed cable in a laptop, what exactly determines how long that cable can be before you start seeing degraded performance?

I have been trying to look for jobs but have not been successful in this economy. I recently received an opportunity to work at a small firm in Detroit through a personal contact.  


\- They don't have any open positions but are essentially creating a position. It will be more of a trainee position with the role similar to that of a process/product development engineer. (I may have to 'clean benches').

94,What are my easiest options for cheap infrared dyes and reflective coatings?,1594675032,"Here's my use case: I would like to have a highly visible (very high-contrast) QR code (actually specifically an ""april tags"" code) which is also large, but without being an ugly sight to the user.  So I was thinking rather than the characteristic black and white high contrast tag, I could make the contrast in the IR part of the spectrum.

* So I could put the QR code (actually april tags code) in a picture frame without glass, with a normal fairly dark background - dark so it tends to absorb IR light, and I could put infrared reflective tape over parts of it and then read it with an infrared camera, which has infrared LED's (or I can also shine my own infrared flashlight on it).  I can flip the infrared image so the light parts of the image become black, and vice versa, thereby giving me an image that is almost totally white with a very clear black outline of the QR code (april tags code).

* Meanwhile although the contrast is large for me, the user wouldn't have to look at the characteristic black and white outline in a large area, since at a casual glance it just seems like any picture.  (It is okay if they notice the reflective parts.)

So with that constraint, I'd like to know what my CHEAP options are!

Here are my questions:

* Is infrared sort of like a ""color"" so that I can find some infrared dye and paint some ""infrared"" spots on an otherwise blank piece of paper or photo?  That's what I was originally thinking.

* Isn't all glass infrared reflective? Could I just cut out glass or any kind of seran wrap type thing in the shape of the QR code I want?

* What about those pieces of tape, that are IR reflective?  Can I find one that is cheap and actually transparent in the visible part of the spectrum but reflects infrared light?

* Or could I find two dyes that are both transparent in the optical range but one is highly reflective in the IR range and one is highly absorbent - then I could use a normal frame including the glass, the user can put whatever they want in the picture frame, and I can just paint onto that glass with the black parts of the QR code (april tags code) painted in the absorbent dye and the white spots of the QR code (april tags code) painted in the reflective dye.  The result could be that the user sees just a normal picture in a normal picture frame but when basked in IR light the camera sees the super high-contrast code?

* Basically ideally I would like to spend about &lt;$10 in materials to come up with something where I can have a bright and clear QR tag painted in infrared, visible from a camera without an infrared lens (I can illuminate it with an infrared flashlight or infrared LED's on the camera, that is okay) but without the user having to see a large visible QR code - they might see it if they really look, but at a glance it should just look like a normal picture.  It's okay if there is a reflective coating in the shape of a QR code though, this is just meant to be a pleasant human interface not any secret.

4,Can I ask some questions about hydrogen fuel cell technology?,1594667947,"I thought of a way to crack hydrogen chemically instead of electrolytically, and it actually works pretty well, but there's no way it would scale up industrially without serious expenditures, which is probably why it isn't done.

I have been reading an awful lot about how hydrogen storage works, how hydrogen fuel cells work, and other related subjects in preparation for actually setting up a system which makes use of these mechanisms to store power. 

I thought it would be wise to ask a few questions, since a lot of the reading is rather theoretical and not practical.

1. I read an article about using proton exchange membranes to compress and purify hydrogen, and I think that's the way to go, everything else seems to be more industrial scale solutions.

What would a hydrogen electrochemical purifier look like, and where would be a good place to find membranes and other parts for it? Is this even the way to go? are there other, more compact methods for separating hydrogen that don't require absurd temperatures and pressures? I'll be separating the hydrogen gas from ammonia gas, water vapor, and nitrogen gas, so a lot of available solutions don't account for the godawful amount of corrosion that will occur when exposing the materials to the gases in my case. 

2. I've read a bit about hydrogen tends to explode when decompressed. This is obviously concerning. I don't want my expensive machine to explode because I put a valve on it and didn't account for this.

I hear there are polymers to put in the valves to prevent this that slow down decompression. Are there other solutions for this?

3. Hydrogen tends to be leaky, and I know this. If I do a solid job with a mig welder, xray the joints, do all my diligence to make sure joints are kept to a minimum, is there a particular alloy of steel you recommend for use in a small scale application like this? Or is steel a bad idea? I'd like to keep as few moving parts and joints as possible in the system, with the exception of lots of valves so I can turn things off if there's issues. 


4. Are there serious issues I haven't thought of, that I probably should consider? This sort of system is rather complex, and if I work on this sort of thing, I'd like to make sure I get it as close to right the first time as possible. 

5. Is there any reason I shouldn't go lower tech? I don't really need extreme efficiency. Hydrogen leaks REALLY WELL from small gaps, I could just set up a sealed chamber with a really long pipe running through it with lots of fittings on it and separate the hydrogen that way, maybe pay someone to modify an engine to burn hydrogen instead of regular fuel, and skip a lot of the technical aspects. 

6. Is there anywhere to just buy fully formed parts, or am I stuck with cobbling this together with a machinist friend in my off time for the next few years? Not that I mind, I love a good project. 

7. Lastly, Is this a dumb idea? I don't really care about the riskiness of the idea, but I do care about the feasibility and efficiency. If I can source my own hydrogen for less than the market rate, I feel like that would eliminate a lot of complaints about the whole thing. The problem is how complex the whole thing looks to be. I could build a lot of things that would be easier to build but more expensive to run, and produce more waste. Is it worth it? 





I'm asking a lot but I haven't been able to find some of these answers, I assume because you fine folks learn them in school, but I don't have that kind of money. I am pretty decent at fabrication though, and I'm willing to put in some effort, and I'm not very space limited, though I'd like to set up the system in a cargo container for mobility (while empty)

The thing is, until now I was having pretty bad grades in university. Let's say that at the end of this year, my gpa is probably going to be around 3.(The scale is from 1-4 , best to worst) Worth mentioning that my uni is the best uni in Germany and is known for having a really rigorous program. It's not that i'm not learning a lot, trust me i am, but i feel that I'm much behind all my other friends because all of them went to competitions in programming, maths etc. and they just seem to 'know how to learn better' if that is even possible and they have much much better basics than me. I wasn't much of a pupil back in high school and i pretty much just started working hard this school year. My hard work immediately payed off in my 3rd semester and I know that it will get only better and better with time. Maybe worth noting is that my gpa is going to probably improve even more in my last year(3rd) because the subjects won't be as theoretical and we'll actually get to choose the subjects that interest us the most and which are actually practically used. I heard from some friends who are older than me that the GPA usually gets much higher(or in the German case, lower)

But then I want to run a (different) current in that same direction through that same object. So I don't know what happens. Does it accidentally induce an AC current? Does it work but the magnetic field and current both weaken? Does the magnetic field pulsate or spin around or something freaky?

My position is in the modeling and sim realm and we provide engineering support services and software. 

I'm honestly looking for advice about how to deal with a seemingly perplexing management style. Here is further background:

- My manager and I have been working together on a task which is a part of a larger project. He initially asked me to propose a few ways to do the task. I did, and he replied ""I don't know how to do any of these ways"" to all of them. We settled on doing it a way he's far more experienced than me with, but I explain this to him in the beginning and tell him that I'll really need some help along the way. He agrees, and we start the task. 

- The next day, he says he won't have much time to help due to his own management tasks and that I'll have to try and work independently. I acknowledge, and move along. 

- In the spirit of trying to give him space and work independently, I've been trying hard to do the task with minimal supervision. Over a month's time, I've pulled tons of research papers, wrote a Word doc of 10+ pages of literary review from those papers. Every week, I've shown him what I found and ask for feedback. Tells me I'm working too slowly, he'd have been able to do my task much more quickly, and he doesn't have time to give me feedback. Last week, he ended up telling me that I've just been ""copying"" from papers and a lot of what I've got in my Word doc is just ""flat out wrong."" I tell him that the purpose of the doc is for me to track my progress and to get feedback from him. He replied with ""I don't have time to give you feedback, "" and walks out of my office. In our next meeting, he berates me in front of everyone and says I'm the only one not making any progress. 

At this point, I'm not sure what to do. Since that interaction, I've had a couple phone interviews in case I have to leave this position.

39,Working of a power plant: Energy transformation process,1594647056,"So I was thinking about how different types of power plants work and something struck me. Things like a hydropower plants or solar cells seem fairly straight to the point, they convert one form of energy into electrical energy in a fairly direct manner. But thermal power plants, whether it be coal, gas or nuclear, they all first convert the chemical enegry of the fuel into heat, then that is used to convert water into steam, which generates pressure, which then causes kinetic energy to finally drive a generator to get electrical power. That seems like such a, sorry if I put it very bluntly, clumsy and inelegant process. When you think about it, we still use steam to power I believe around 70% of the world. So I was wondering whether there are any alternative ways of converting the potential energy in those fuels into electrical power. I couldn't think of anything except for using an engine, like in diesel generators and similar things, but since these are not applied on a large scale I concluded they must be less efficient. It also feels like a somewhat stupid question actually. What also got me thinking is why they use water, surely there must be liquids better suited for this, or is it because water is easily accessable and cheap?

Thanks for your time.

I'm wary of this design during impact forces in a car crash, which has created a bending moment arm, and would create huge bending stress in the bolt threads. There's also the bolt tension which adds stress, and the stress concentrations of the threads.

I reckon a much better design is to put a steel member between, and leave bolts to only see direct shear forces: The steel member has much higher section modulus to resist bending, than spacers or washers could.

48,What is something electrical engineers know that but other people don't know?,1594637449,"  1. Did you ever notice gravel beneath and around large transformers?

​​​​One of the reasons for this practice is actually ""**snakes"".** Yes, you read it right.  
Large transformers produce substantial vibrations due to magnetostriction which gets transmitted to the ground. Due to this effect, the transformers placed on solid ground attract snakes. To prevent this, transformers are surrounded by gravel which prevents snakes from coming near it.

2. A common ceiling fan (not the BLDC ones) can actually rotate in either direction. It is the capacitor that makes it run in a specific direction (clockwise or anticlockwise). If you just remove the capacitor and complete the remaining circuit you can make it run in either direction by giving it a gentle push.

3. You can estimate the transmission voltage in overhead lines by merely counting the number of insulator disks used to support the wires.

​​​Each of such disks can withstand 11 kV of voltage. So in case you see 3 disks then you can safely deduce that the transmission voltage can be around 33 kV.

4. If you look at the transmission line you might find small devices like the one in the image below.

​They are called Stockbridge Dampers. They are usually present as a pair on either side of a pole/suspension point. They are used to dampen out vibrations produced in transmission lines.

5. Zebra, Dog, Peacock, Moose, Dog, Hen are also named for transmission line conductors. They differ from each other in terms of size, a number of strands, the material used, etc.

6. About 70% of the electricity produced in the world is actually consumed by Induction Motors. Their ruggedness, easy speed control, nil maintenance requirement make them the most commonly-used motor.

7. Hydro Power Plants are actually a necessity in today's electrical grid network. In their absence, the electrical grid will become highly susceptible to load variations and collapse on the occurrence of a moderate load variation on the consumer end. It is because these hydro turbines increase the inertia of the power system which protects it from sudden jerks due to load variations.

EDIT 1 :

8. Magnetic field strength developed inside a transformer core ranges from 1.5 to 1.6 tesla. It is very large in comparison to the magnetic field strength of Earth or the Sun.

​​​​Earth's magnetic field is of the order of a microtesla. Whereas the Sun's magnetic field ranges from 0.1 to 100 milliteslas.

9. You must have seen that overhead transmission lines are laid with a sag in them.

​​​​​The sag is not introduced instinctively. It is mathematically calculated to determine the height of the middle point of the conductor from the ground keeping in mind the effect of wind, temperature, frost, and other types of condensation.

EDIT 2 :

10. Electromagnetic isolation for a device can be achieved by placing it in a metallic enclosure. The same principle works in Faraday's Cage to protect a person from high voltages.

​Sometimes line maintenance workers have to work on the active transmission lines ​to prevent loss of power. The workers are directed to wear Faraday's Suit then to prevent electrocution from induced currents in their tissues due to high strength electrical and magnetic fields.

&gt;​The suit is in effect a wearable Faraday cage, which equalizes the potential over the body, and ensures there is no through-tissue current. The strong electric field surrounding charged equipment is enough to drive a current of approximately 15 μA for each kV·m−1 through a human body. To prevent this, hot-hand workers are usually required to wear a Faraday suit.

EDIT 3:

11. The shaft of a 2 pole 3 phase synchronous generator, in power stations, operating at 60 Hz can spin at 3600 rev/min.

The blades of your humble kitchen juicer &amp; grinder rotate at a whopping 20,000 rev/min. They utilize either a DC or a Universal motor. So it goes without saying that you must keep your fingers out of them.

As an interesting comparison, the cricketing legend Shane Warne is able to spin the cricket ball at around 5000 revs/min. I bet he can make one hell of an orange juice.

&gt;PS: Reducing Step Potential and Touch Potential are the main reasons for using gravel beneath transformers. The use of gravel grants us many other benefits too. Deterring snakes is ONE OF THEM.

When the person releases the Pawl, the load falls quickly because of weight.

Is there a way to have a controlled drop of the weight so it doesn't drop too fast or too slow?

Ideally, a person would be able to flip a switch depending on how heavy the load is.

Example,

**Light Load** (5lb) switch mechanism to light mode (not much tension required to control release of load)

**Heavy Load** (30lb) switch mechanism to heavy mode (more tension required to control release of load).

You'll top out way sooner than your friends in other disciplines, like HR or supply chain management, or accounting. After 5 years you'll both be making the same, but their job doesn't suck, yours does. You'll answer to sales associates that are stupider than you, even within their own discipline. They'll get credit for your accomplishments, because your company executives are all former sales people, or business development managers and are biased towards them.

Sure some engineers are making $100K out the door but they live in expensive areas, and are probably logging in mega hours doing some soul crushing coding for 60 hours a week. The nature of a lot of work is also highly specialized. This makes it hard to switch jobs to something else once you get put on the subject matter track (they will try to do this to you, because everyone wants to move to the administrative side, including people from other areas). You'll always be a nerd in the company eyes.

I probably have a higher credit rating than anyone at my company that was allowed to touch the budget, own and manage rental properties, and trade options as a hobby.

Turns out they brought me in the be the only EE in a company that apparently hires only ME. You can imagine the upcoming situations. 

So first project is solving the problem of an inaccurate 5 micron linear magnetic encoder. The machine uses 5 servos. 2 for xy on top rail. Two fot xy on bottom rail. And one for z on top rail. Magnetic strip is on top rail in x direction. When just that servo is on encoder is accurate. When the bottom rail servos are on its a little off, but when top z is on encoder is all over the place. Mind you this is just turning them on. Not moving them. 

I assumed it was back EMF from servos. Encoder uses square waves and since servos use PWM I figure that is the problem but I have no idea how to isolate. Encoder head doesn't touch metal rail. Held in place by ABS plastic bracket though they are still using metal screw.

There is all 36mV noise on signal line at all times that bother me, bit doesn't change when servos are on. Looks to be from the computer not connected to computer. They are us8ng LabView which of course I am new to.

My plan is to check grounds of servos but like I said I dont know how to isolate back EMF. Any help would be appreciated. 

Company believes since I am a degreed EE that I can fix all electrical problems. Even though EE could have focused on Power, Robotics, Programming, Networking, Solid State, Circuits.. etc etc. I of course did not choose Robotics.

Despite travelling for a couple of years I could not get an engineering job due to visa complications so i decided to come home temporarily. I then got really sick and had to make the decision to take more time off when I arrived home until I was in remission. I then managed to get myself into remission with my health, and began applying for jobs again and failed to find anything for 4 months. Then Covid happened and 4 months later I am back applying for engineering roles again. I am starting to really become disheartened by the fact that I might never get an engineering position even though I believe I will excel in this career choice. I couldn't do internships during university due to an underlying health issue and after university I really needed to unwind whilst I tried to treat my chronic disease. The only experience I have is working on the FSAE team as a project leader, which I learnt so much and developed my skills greatly. 

Does anyone have any advice they can offer? The idea that I might never get an engineering position is really starting to get me down. I understand the timing is not the best, but does anyone think I have a good chance of still landing a graduate position in the near future? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am happy to volunteer if necessary, and I am also currently studying a MATLAB course to help me master that software. Other ideas for staying relevant I would also appreciate.

88,Is a career in engineering possible with only a mathematics background?,1594588688," 

Hello, AskEngineers. I am looking for some advice from those who are familiar with career opportunities in engineering fields.

I have a BS in mathematics and am a semester or two away from completing an MS degree. I am tremendously passionate about mathematics, but to make a long story short, there is pretty much zero opportunity for me to put food on the table with what I've chosen to focus my life on, and as such, I am considering my options for careers outside of my field. Aside from mathematics, I have always been very into electronics, and I had intended to do an EE degree before I discovered my love of math in my early years of college. I have a decent knowledge of basic electronics theory from reading EE textbooks as a hobby, and I have done various electronics projects over the years. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable on some aspects of EE for someone who is only self-taught, and I think that my formal training as a mathematician has equipped me with the tools to learn things from textbooks with minimal guidance. With that being said, I was wondering how employers would feel about my situation? Are there any entry level jobs out there for which I could leverage my math degrees to get my foot in the door, and pick up new skills along the way? I do not expect the kind of career opportunities of a proper BSEE graduate, but is there at least something that I could do?

FWIW, I am not interested in being a programmer/software engineer, and I have been in school for too many years to consider taking any more classes after I finish my graduate studies.

90,What can I add/remove from my civil engineering personal statement?,1594586850,"I am applying for university next year and here's my first draft of my personal statement, I'm planning on doing a civil engineering course so any help would be appreciated! :

 

I see civil engineering as a liberal art of the engineering world. I believe civil engineering challenges us to push the boundaries of the impossible and make it a reality, I am fascinated by its existence since the beginning of our time on earth and how it consistently evolves to change and shape the environment we live in . As I’ve grow older I came to the realisation that everything around us is built the way it is very deliberately and studying engineering at high school and seeing it first hand at a work place has shown me that civil engineering is a versatile vocation, with endless possibilities to improve our planet. 

I had a work placement at Arcadis, one of the top engineering consultancies in England, they worked on projects from as little as local bridges to the HS2 to enormous projects like the Burj Khalifa, my time there transformed the way I viewed engineering, I witnessed the multiple disciplinaries within engineering sectors and how projects we see in day to day life are huge collaborations between them, clearly highlighting the importance of team work. It was also interesting to see the amount of work and different factors that are considered when working on a project such as planning, surveying, budgeting and marketing. My placement there fuelled my interest in the subject to pursue as a future career. 

I am a regular reader of the ICE news, one of my major interests within civil engineering is how we can build projects that will benefit the population whilst working with nature in order to prevent damage. I am extremely passionate about sustainability and looking after the world around us, I have attended multiple climate strikes in my city, so I’m naturally drawn to new and innovative projects that are sustainable and work with nature instead of against it. 

One of my strengths is problem solving, in my spare time I like to work on coding projects that require me to problem solve in order to come up with a solution. I find coding also improves my numeracy and analytical thinking skills and writing programmes challenges me to think creatively and critically in order to come up with a suitable solution to problems. In my first year at sixth form I mentored children from our high school in maths which proved to be a challenge as I had to explain concepts I already understood in a simpler and easier to digest manner, it was a valuable experience as it improved my communication skills with the child I was mentoring but the role of mentoring also meant I had to work on my visualisation skills to illustrate skills I already knew to someone with less understanding. I am fluent in three languages excluding English, two of which I learn online through my strong enthusiasm and commitment. Adapting to new situations has always excited me, moving to the UK from Italy at the age of 9 was undoubtedly challenging, in my final year of high school I was part of the student leadership team which taught me how to manage my time well and the experience overall made me a more responsible and well-rounded individual. 

As a woman in this sector I hope to graduate with a degree and inspire other females to pursue their education in engineering from an early age, I believe change starts with representation so I hope to have a long fulfilling career as a civil engineer that can hopefully inspire others young girls to do the same.",AskEngineers,False,neptuneblue02,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hq1qkw/what_can_i_addremove_from_my_civil_engineering/

Let me introduce myself. I am 35 years old, from Germany, my apprenticeship started at the end of February, takes 28 months and i won't receive an academic degree. I got to this profession because of severe health issues that prevented me from continuing my old job and almost put me into pension.

I couldn't find the equivalent of my education outside of Germany, mechanical engineer is as close as it get's. We are not as math and science heavy though. In the past our job title would have been called technical illustrator although it's more than just illustrating. We will have to pick metal-alloys depending on various criteria, plan, design and build parts and assemblies with CAD, pick tolerances, document steps, etc.

Things are going pretty well so far, i am always ahead of my classmates (sometimes days) and I've completed all tests revolving around math, metallurgy, construction and documentation far below the required time with a score of 95+%.

16,Please help understanding Design Factors (Shigley Example 1-1),1594554630,"Shigley says the design factor is :

n = design factor = loss of function parameter/ maximum allowable parameter

In the question however, he says the load causing failure is known within +/- 15% and is nominally 2000lbf. He also says the maximum load on a structure is known within an uncertainty of +/- 20%. He

He calculates the design factor as:

n = (1/0.85) / (1/1.2) = 1.4

I don't understand this. He says in the example we only care about the maximum loss of function load., represented as (1/0.85). This doesn't make sense to me. Why are we thinking the structure will break at this highest possible load when it could break or fail at (1/1.15). In other words, he considers 2300 as the loss of function parameter (2000\*1.15) rather than 1700 (2000\*0.85). Similarly I don't understand his thinking of using the minimum possible maximum allowable parameter.

18,Questions from an aspiring civil engineer returning to study in their late 20’s - is it too late?,1594545175,"
I’m returning to study Civil Engineering next year and am worried my age might be a problem when I graduate. Depending on what course I choose, I’ll either graduate aged 30 or 32. Would this be an issue when I enter the graduate job market as I’d be older with no experience?

My main goal is to hopefully get a degree level apprenticeship that would let me work with a company and earn a degree at the same time. Aside from Maths and Science qualifications, what else would make me stand out as a potential candidate for an entry level role like this? I have a degree in software development and 3 years experience working on major civil construction sites as a labourer but as I have over a year to improve my skills and qualifications, I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations on what else could help me stand out above the rest as I hear they’re very competitive? I was thinking trying to teach myself the basics of how to use 3D CAD software or something similar like that but haven’t fully looked into it as I’m still swamped with maths work!

I guess I’m also looking for some encouragement or reassurance that I have little to worry about in the grand scheme of things as long as I keep working my ass off. I have a bit of negative mindset sometimes and am worried that it’s just too late to follow my dream and that I’ve already messed my life up irredeemably by getting the wrong a level subjects/results first time round as a teenager. 

Final question is UK specific: How much does the university matter as long as the degree is accredited by the ICE? I’m limited in choices because I’ll be studying part time and have read some negative reviews about the place I’m considering but as long as it’s accredited and I do well, does it really matter? 

Thanks a lot to anyone who’s read this and any advice would be immensely appreciated.

I understand that when it comes to setting up a power station for this it would have double the material in some case but is this not worth it? 

And on a side note how does power distribution in this manner affect those who would receive this power? If a 6-phase power station was set up does this mean that it would be able to power a larger area due to its doubling the power? Is it harder for a company to maintain that level of power?

34,Is it better to stick with a bad engineering internship or to quit?,1594518366,"I'm an Electrical Engineering student and I'm currently at my wits end with my internship. I've completed about 6 months out of the one year program. The two engineers I'm under seem completely clueless. Whenever I ask them a question they can never figure out an answer. All the operators at the plant are very vocal about the fact that they don't know how to do their jobs after 5+ years of working there. When I started they admitted they didn't come up with anything for me to do because their last intern just goofed around on their phone. I spent the entire first month just reading manuals all day long. The head electrician got really upset about it and said  I should be working with the trades people to get more hands on experience. For whatever reason my boss didn't want that to happen. A higher level engineer stepped in and helped me to learn how to read PIDs and single line diagrams. Any time he wasn't around my boss just wanted me to sit around not doing anything useful. I think the two engineers I'm under are the only electrical engineers at the plant. Everyone else seems to want me to learn something but they don't and I'm starting to wonder if they want me to quit.

After COVID I got to work from home. They tasked me with automating reports in Excel for the operators. I was given one working example and had to make the rest. Its slowly turning into a nightmare. One I got to work but it ran extremely slowly. After I talked to the people that made their software I found out its slow to import or export large data sets because they're using an ancient version of the software. They're not upgrading their software until sometime next year and still want me to get it working faster even though the makers couldn't think of a work around.  Another I had to quit halfway through because half the data I needed wasn't even in the software. I had a meeting with my boss and an operator this week about my progress on the current report. I mentioned that the values from the software I was using were different from what the operator had recorded. It was just casually mentioned that the operators were using different software and I needed to get my data to match theirs exactly so they won't have problems when they get audited. I've never seen the software they're using and don't have access to it. I honestly don't know what to even do at this point.

Sadly this is a government internship.  I'm not sure if they'd say anything bad about me if I left early. If they did it would probably hurt me if I apply for a different government position after I graduate. I might be able to come up with some school/COVID related excuse to leave but I don't know if that would work.

I have a BS in Civil Engineering, with a concentration in water resources engineering; a certificate in energy systems engineering (also obtained back in undergrad); and an MS in Mechanical Engineering, with a concentration in energy and sustainability. My prior internships and research experiences were related to water resources engineering, environmental engineering, and energy engineering. My current position is so unique, that when I saw the initial job posting back in late 2019, I knew I had to apply for it. 6 months into it, and I’m absolutely loving it.

I’m currently studying for the CEM exam (in my case, if I take it sometime soon, and pass, I would become an EMIT, or an Energy Manager in Training, and all I would have to do is get a couple more years of experience in order to obtain the “CEM” title). Additionally, I knew that I wanted to take PE exam ever since college (before grad school, I took and passed the FE, and am now an EIT), I just wasn’t exactly sure which one I would take, as I didn’t know what I would be doing after graduation, at the time!

First case- I'm letting my kids use my old Xbox 360. Yesterday we had an issue where it just wouldn't turn on. Initially it would make the noises when you press the power and CD tray buttons, but it wouldn't actually power up. So I went through the basic trouble shooting routine trying to find the cause of failure. After I unplugged the 360 from the power block it actually got worse. So I swapped the power block out for a different one that I knew worked, and it still failed to power on. I naturally reasoned that the issue was located somewhere internal to the 360, and was basically dead (not paying for repairs on a 7 year old console). I left the 360 where it was and stashed the power block away. Today, on a whim, I plugged it back up and it booted up just fine. Lucky me I guess.  
     
Second case- Some years back my TV started to fail. I don't remember the exact description but I do know it was losing picture right down the center (maybe dead pixels? It was 9 years ago). I wasn't surprised though, as my GF (now ex) was obsessed with always having the TV on, even while sleeping. I remember just turning the TV off all day and did something else. Later that evening when I turned it back on the issue was fixed, and it never happened again.      
     
So what gives? In both cases I did nothing to fix the issue apart from turning them off and letting them sit for awhile. In the case of the 360 I went through all the basic troubleshooting steps: It wasn't overheated, has good ventilation, relatively dust free, and I isolated the cause by using a separate component.

The cables can be switched to give 12v or 24v  depending on the application. All of the trucks we typically get run off of 12v systems, so we jump them off with 12v.

 Sometimes, if the vehicle batteries are completely dead, or if the charge on the jump cart is low, my boss will tell me to have someone briefly switch the system to 24v while I crank the truck up, after which my assistant will switch back to 12v. This generally works VERY well, making the starter run much faster than normal. My boss told me that it has to be switch back to 12v quickly to avoid burning up the vehicle wiring.

Now, here's the part I don't understand: I was under the assumption that batteries are rated by Cold-Cranking- Amperage, vehicles needed a minimum of X amount of amps to be able to start in cold climates.

- Lab demo payscale, I am a band 2 - 3, so I can go up to end of band 3.  How fast I move along the scale is not disclosed yet. I had heard this facility is potentially an 18 month to max, which sounds insane.

- Student Loan Repayment is possible, I can ask about that with my manager to see about lump sum or in payments. I need to check if it is 10,000 per calendar year from starting or calendar year in general, since it is already July. 

- They encourage education and they may be willing to reimburse tuition costs for continuing education immediately (I had read that it takes a year first). 

- Health, Vision, Dental will all be available for select immediately.

- Thrift Savings and retirement plans are also available.


Does this sound like a study job offer or is there any glaring issues?  Is there any benefits I have not mentioned that I should ask about that people are aware of?

I intend to continue my education to be of more value to the facility and more skilled in my field.

For the most part, I don’t have to talk about the end use of the product, but when it comes up I get extremely light-headed/anxious and I’m honestly worried I’m gonna pass out one of these days.

4,Advice on getting an online Engineering MS,1594420450,"I would love some of your opinions on this question.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently work as a technician at an aerospace company, and while I thoroughly enjoy it, I feel the earning and intellectual ceiling is too low for my long term goals.

&amp;#x200B;

My undergrad is in plant sciences, but most of my work background has been in assembly, machine shop, mechanical, and electronic type environments. I find engineering really stimulating and would like to get more into it as a profession even though it is not entirely in line with my previous studies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since my work offers tuition reimbursement, I am considering going for an online degree out of convenience. In person seems better for a variety of reasons, like being funded, working in labs, and meeting people, but given both my lack of an engineering BS, the current corona situation, and the value of being able to keep working and earning while I study, it seems like online might be a great option.

&amp;#x200B;

I was previously thinking I would go in state, but the offerings here are not quite what I want, so I'm thinking it might be worth it (in terms of ROI) to just pay out of pocket for an out of state degree somewhere else (looking at UCLA at the moment). I'm not certain, but I think I'm interested in material science, manufacturing design, product design, or possibly things more related to aerospace to piggyback on my current work position's experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I would just wonder if any of you would be able to give me any advice, both from a professional and academic standpoint, about this idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, my back education included calc, organic and bio chemistry, basic calc based physics, and a few one-off classes like metallurgy and design for people with disabilities. I have some personal experience with Fusion360 and would like to get more proficient at it.

6,Value of a PhD in industry vs government contracting or civilian positions? Any advice or experience?,1594417175,"Hello r/AskEngineers. 

I am a mechanical engineer with a Masters degree currently working for an academic research institution on a federal government contract. I graduated back in 2018. When I finished my Masters, I had not planned on continuing on to get a PhD and I was mainly looking at jobs in industry. However, I ended up taking my current job which is more research focused. I took the job because the project sounded interesting and is related to a technology area I am interested in pursuing as a career. It was also the most attractive offer I had in terms of overall salary, benefits, and location.

I like my job and plan to put in a couple more years there. However, I am looking toward the future and am trying to decide what the best career path is for myself. 

My government sponsor has floated the idea out there of me getting a PhD, but I'm not sure if this is something I really want to do. I know there are plenty of benefits to a PhD, and I would most likely be able to receive funding for research related to my current work, but I'm not super excited about the prospect of going back to school for another 4-6 years, especially after earning an actual salary for the last two. If I'm being honest, research is something I'm not particularly passionate about. I love the creative freedom and hands-on aspect of my job, but I loathe the more academic duties (publishing, proposals, conferences, etc.).

However, my colleagues have made some good arguments for getting a PhD. If I ever manage to transition from contractor to govt. civilian, I might max out my career/salary limits early, as PhDs are preferred for a lot of senior level civilian positions in my field. There is also the argument that in several years time, PhDs will become more attractive for many employers as the value of a Masters degree starts to depreciate. There are also a lot of soft skills that come with a PhD (technical writing, leaderships skills, etc.) that would only be an advantage to me on a resume.

I'm pretty confident I could easily make the transition to industry with my current experience and skill set. My impression is that a PhD is generally valued less by most industry companies than it is in research and is therefore unnecessary. I also wouldn't mind staying in contractor positions, so long as I'm not making purely sideways moves.

Does anyone here have advice or experience working as a government contractor or civilian with or without a PhD? How has it affected your career? Is it wise to avoid a PhD if my heart isn't in research, or is it worth it to bite the bullet and do it now early in my career for the potential late career benefits?",AskEngineers,False,Pharaoh-Magnetic,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hoxsyk/value_of_a_phd_in_industry_vs_government/

I (23F) live with my grandmother for the time being. This is because my mother lived here up until last year, and when my mother moved out, my grandma then had a pretty nice room vacant upstairs. My room is pretty large, it takes up over half of the second story.

My worry is if my floor is structurally sound. The second story consists of two large rooms, one of which is mine. Sometime recently (I guess like 2 months ago or so) I started noticing that my floor (which is carpeted) suddenly felt uneven when I would walk on it. I can take one step and feel the that level of the floor is slightly lower or higher. Now, for context, the floor has had a creaking issue for years. However, I never noticed anything odd aside from the occasional creak when I’d step in certain spots until a couple months ago. Anyways, not only does the floor feel uneven, but I can also feel random little bumps in the floor. It almost feels like maybe it could be where the beams in the floor intersect or something? I know nothing about floors or structures, but that is my best guess. Additionally, the floor bounces pretty substantially. Any time I walk or do anything, I feel it bounce/vibrate like I’m at a small house party or something. It even feels like it is slightly vibrating every time the air conditioning comes on. Again, never noticed that until recently.

I have severe anxiety, so I keep urging my grandma to please get this checked out. I understand that I do not pay the mortgage so I may sound ungrateful or whatever, but I am genuinely worried that the floor may collapse and that something is seriously wrong structurally. Is that even possible? Can a floor suddenly start having issues with bouncing and uneven spots, then collapse shortly thereafter? My grandma keeps saying she will get it checked out, and then just puts it off. Should I start sleeping on the couch downstairs/is it unsafe to continue staying in my room? I just cannot tell after researching for countless hours online whether or not the floor is in immediate danger. Many articles say this happens and there is no need to panic, and other articles say a floor with these issues could collapse at any moment.

For reference, the house was built sometime in the 80s, and the carpeting up here on the second floor was replaced back in November (no clue if that matters, but can’t hurt to include it).

74,What's the difference between similarly rated brushless motors for go-karts vs electric skateboards?,1594332571,"Hi all! 

I am looking into electric bldc motors, in hopes to buy one (and a controller) for a go-kart. I have found that while looking for motors with a certain power spec, say 3000W, there are many motors designed for electric skateboards that are much smaller (and a little cheaper) than the ones ""meant"" for go-karts. In addition, it seems that the electric skateboard motors go much higher in power than I can find for go-karts.   


Presumably, there is a good reason that the motors designed for go karts are larger, and thus I should not buy a small motor to drive a go kart, but I am curious as to why they are larger.   
If both motors have the same power spec, why is one much larger than the other, and why shouldn't I buy the small motor to power the kart? Is because the larger motor takes a higher voltage or something?

77,Design Engineers - How do you avoid those 'schoolboy' errors we all seem to make?,1594331391,"Hi everyone,

I'm a mechanical design engineer who designs product handling equipment. I wanted to write this post after some recent frustrations i've been feeling in work. I hope that some of my fellow designers (or anyone for that matter) might read this and would like to share their thoughts. You might read this and get where i'm coming from with some of the points! Apologies if i come across like i'm moaning, i'll admit it felt good writing this, but I'd really like see how other engineers deal with the below issues on a personal level and a practical/ solution based way.

So..... It's occurred to me recently that I and the other engineers in my office can't seem to get away from making those schoolboy errors. By this, I mean silly things like holes being misaligned in mating parts, the wrong fixings being selected for the clearance holes in a part, clashes with mating parts..... the list goes on. Part of me gets frustrated, i'm not a master of my trade but experienced enough not to be making these mistakes, yet i make them. It's not through naivety or lack of engineering know-how but carelessness and lack of attention to detail i suppose. I analyse this frustration I have with myself and realise that almost every designer in our office makes these silly mistakes. Its not just in my office either, i noticed the same thing at my last place and the other engineers in the office agree that it's a common thing, these silly mistakes *'are just part of the job'* they say. i understand we make mistakes, we are all human, but i don't want these schoolboy errors to be part of the job!

 It's frustrating when the shop-floor or management look at you like you're an imbecile for making such stupid mistakes. It looks obvious when you stood on the shop floor and clearly two parts aren't fitting together. I used to work on the shop floor and use to give the design engineers the same look, but i'm on the other side of the fence now and it's not easy at times. Some people think that the CAD system your using makes it super easy, but in reality, it a tool to do a job no more than a spanner is. The truth is that most stuff i've designed generally, fundamentally works and i like to think that systems have been designed with safety, cost, manufacture, installation, etc... all somewhat taken into account. I haven't had many major disasters ( we've all had one or two nightmare jobs am I right!!) overall, but i do let myself down with those 'schoolboy' errors at times. One might argue that often you are pulled from pillar to post and thus get distracted from your work. You're about to add a hole into the part your designing and then BAM! Your phone goes, then a lad from the shopfloor comes in with question, then you have a meeting. Next time to sit down to work, you miss that hole. As i said, it looks all to obvious when your staring at on the shop floor. scratching you're whilst John the big hairy fitter  shakes his head in disappointment! 😁

How all this has come about is because the company i work for is documenting all of these issues and its quite bad when you see the numbers. Admittedly, when you break it down, some of the documented issues have been a missing dimension on a drawing or lack of information on a drawing. Some of the more severe issues documented have been issues where something has needed re-drilling, holes slotted, etc.... 

I mention some of the process we have in place currently. We do have a design review  once the system is designed/modeled. Present is a senior engineer and a engineering manager. Usually the fundamentals of the design are covered, thinking about fit, form, function. Recently, a checklist has been put in place that needs to be run through before the drawings are issued. This covers things like 'are the correct fixings on the bill of materials' or ' are key-ways correct in shafts' for example. Basically a general checklist that will hopefully make the designers double check those things that often cause issues. 

Anyway enough of me waffling on. What's your thoughts on this topic? Are there any engineers that feel my frustrations? What processes do you personally use or do your company use to combat these issues? Is it better use of the CAD software, more checking procedures, more time added to projects that allow you take your time more? IF anyone's got anything they'd like to share on this topic then please do. I don't imagine that i'm alone in these thoughts!

So we're having a bit of a debate at work about the EIA-364-06 specification which is dedicated to measuring contact resistance. 

Nothing too complicated really but one point has raised questions: the specification states that if the voltage drop measured is very low, ""reverse current reading shall be taken"" and then you average the measurments.

So maybe there is something lost in translation to us, but do we agree that this means that you should invert the probes between the contact measuring points ?

If so, does this mean that it is expected that the resistance of a conductor might have a different resistance depending on the current's direction? (This is really weird to me but some of my colleagues came to this conclusion)

15,"What qualification do I need guys? Seriously, I'm getting the run around and it's driving me mad with frustration, I'm nearly ready to cry at the absurdity of getting no answers",1594281593,"G'day guys,

I'm looking to get into the electric car industry, I want to work on, design, build, play with, repair, and or be in the electric car industry.

I have talked to TAFE QLD, almost every university in QLD, about engineering, ""mechanicing"", working on, designing, honestly, I just want to get into electric cars.

Honestly, I thought it would be simple, Automotive Engineering, or Electrical Engineering, or Mechatronics Engineering, Electrical Automotive Technician, whatever.

But then I started talking to TAFE's and Uni's about do I need a Trade, Certificate, Diploma, Bachelor, Masters,  Doctorate, what?

I have talked to career advisors, employers, etc.

All anyone can tell me is ""We don't know""

Some are like ""Well you could do Automotive Engineering, but there isn't anything in it at this stage through our organisation that deals with Electric Cars"", others are like ""You can do Electrical Engineering, but none of it is Automotive"" and others are like ""Mechatronics seems to be the go, but it doesn't really qualify you for the field you are interested in""

I don't care if it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or whatever years, I just want to know what hill I need to die on so to speak to get qualified.

After a decade driving trucks for the Army, hands on wheel, brain in neutral, I just want a change. I want to better myself, look to the future, do something cool and innovative, and be part of change.

I'm almost ready to give up, I have even emailed people that work with electric cars and asked them, what skills/course do I need to gear myself up to get a job in the industry, and they either don't answer me for fear I'll become competition (Some have literally said that, being keen to get into it means that I want them out of it), or they're like ""You just fall into it, just do whatever, you'll get there""

I don't want to do ""Whatever"" and ""Just get there"", sure, if I end up better at it, I will compete, absolutely. I'd be silly not to. But everyone seems to be smoke and mirrors about it.

The only answer anyone is being able to give me is ""Move to America or Germany, get *some* qualification, get *any* qualifcation, and hound Tesla or VAG or BMW to give you a job."" which seems like piss poor way of going about it to me. I mean, I'm not above hounding people to give me a job, but what skillsets do I need in the industry? Where do I start? I know that no professional ever really ends their learning, but no one can even give me an idea where to start the learning.

This literally seems to be a case of the more I learn about the industry, the less I know about the industry.

I recently graduated as an aeronautical engineer from a big engineering university in the mid west and am moving back to California to find a job as an mechanical engineer. A little background knowledge... while in college i made dumb mistakes and hung around people that only cared about partying. I graduated with good internships, and grades but in my partying I received a dui which Was eventually brought down to a “wet reckless” or a reckless driving misdemeanor. A couple months later I received a another misdemeanor for disobeying the orders of a police officer. I am embarrassed Just saying it.  As bad as the situation was, it’s made me a better person and changed my lifestyle for the better. Nonetheless, I constantly worry that the mistake I made will affect me my whole life.

I researched heavily into this and the more I research the more hopeless I am so I turn to you, in your experience how badly have I ruined my chances of working as an engineer?

I had a job offer after graduating, but due to COVID-19, that offer was  rescinded. So I decided to start studying for the FE exam and also start a personal project during this down time.

The personal project I decided to settle on was an HVAC design project for an office building that a friend was assigned a couple of years back when he took an HVAC design elective at my college.

19,Joule-Thomson Expansion Effect - What's the fundamental relationship between expansion and cooling exactly? I've looked everywhere,1594268119,"I've been thinking in circles about the relationship between the key variables in relation to the JT Expansion Effect. I'm particularly talking about a situation where the expansion takes place across a valve. Please help clarify...

I've read almost every source but all that is defined is the Joule-Thomson coefficient which describes the dT/dP i.e., magnitude of cooling per magnitude of pressure drop. But from my understanding, the actual cooling fundamentally happens due to the *expansion*, particularly in the form of **PV increase**.

1) So shouldn't there be a straightforward relationship between the magnitude of expansion (specifically magnitude of PV increase) and the magnitude of cooling?

2) Very importantly related to the above question: What actually determines the magnitude of the PV increase?

3) Also, dT/dp is well known to increase as temperature decreases. Again, what is the effect of temperature on PV increases?

I graduated near the top of my class with around a 3.5 GPA, but unfortunately was never able to get an internship (I had a summer research position at my university instead and was able to co-author a couple published papers, but that hasn't really helped me). Was able to get a few interviews after graduation but no offers, then hiring slowed down after summar/fall and now covid has made the job market a lot worse too. I had been working as a barista but my work closed down due to covid and I'm on unemployment benefits.

Basically at this point I feel like I don't have much of a chance at getting an entry level engineering position with no experience and a year gap from graduation when there are so few openings and so many new grads for companies to choose from. I feel like there must be some other fields I could apply to where my degree could give me an edge, even if they aren't as interesting and don't pay as well as an actual engineering position. I figured I'd post here to see if anyone has any ideas for what to do in this situation - I'm really hoping I don't end up having to work at a grocery store or something after my unemployment runs out.

 I am a Structural Analyst with a large Aerospace company in the US. I have been looking to move out of the country (ideally EU), but the Aerospace field seems to be very location limited.

 My first thought is Automotive, with a revised focus on affordable structures rather than light weight. Civil would require a PE or similar certification to solve the same Mc/I equations but with building codes in mind.

I need a switch that's triggered by a marble sized object at the end of a vertical tube. I initially thought to just put a microswitch at the bottom but I can't find a switch and marble combination that has the mass to trigger the switch. 

An optical solution (e.g., ir diode and ir sensor that's blocking) isn't ideal because the tube should appear clear (the bottom of the tube can accept a switch, but the marble can't ""fall through"" so it needs to be visible and electronic components outside the tube would be problematic). There's also a good chance that alignment would be an issue as this device would be subject to considerable jostling.

Would it be feasible to use metal contacts and short them with a metal ball (~5V) even if the marble is regularly handled (i.e., whatever crap people have on their hands getting on the marble)? I've considered a Reed switch but they seem fragile as this marble will fall a decent distance and I can't guarantee any magnetic orientation.

At the welding supply store where I bought the CO2 cylinder, an employee told me that he was sure that there's no different between industrial grade and food grade CO2 in terms of the actual gas, but simply that the food grade CO2 comes with an additional label and perhaps some analytical information of its composition.

I've heard this opinion echoed online, but you never know who these people are or their qualifications to be telling you ""it's just the same."" I'd like not to risk my future health thanks to opinions from people who don't fundamentally understand gas processing or chemistry.

Is there a chemical engineer out there working for a big gas supplier that knows the answer to this question? It seems logical to me that it might be cheaper for a company just to have one CO2 production process to produce both industrial and food grade gas, then simply charge more for food grade CO2 thanks to the additional labeling and analysis requirements. But I'd love to be sure.

It look as though I'll need a cable with a DC 5525 tip to connect to the TS100 and screwing down the bare metal ends to the one of each of the V+ and V- (though I'm not sure which) in order to power it, and for input to the power supply, I'll be connecting a power cable to the L/N/G from a wall outlet--L being hot; perhaps I could cut up a spare computer power cable to do so--similar to the DC 5525 cable for the TS100 &lt;-&gt; PS connection.

I think V+ is the hot end, and V- is the neutral end--I'm thinking that these may be terms for AC and not DC currents.

I’m aware that getting an FE for this discipline is not really necessary but I’ve heard that some people regretted not doing it sooner as it could’ve been useful down the line. It was quite easy for me to pass this exam as all the info was very similar to what I learned and I remembered mostly everything. I had some extra time due to quarantine so I figured it wouldn’t hurt and it paid off. 


So now, I’m just not sure what to do. The job I currently work at is not in the IE field so my work is not relevant towards this subject. I currently work as an associate engineer at an electric company for about 9 months now. It’s a great job (good pay, good security, good people) but I’m not really satisfied with the work itself and want to do something relevant to my field. I wasn’t able to achieve this coming out of college so I had to settle for this job.

I also plan on getting my six sigma black belt certification by the end of the year before searching for a new job (I currently have a green belt).


Any industrial PEs or people who have passed the FE out there? Where can I go from here and what should I do? Can I become an EIT at a job that isn’t relevant for the field I took the FE for?

# On changing career direction


I’m really not enjoying this line of work and want to find something else to do. Not entirely sure what, but I need a change. I don’t see myself in a strictly design role, I didn’t enjoy CAD much in school and like using my hands/not being tied to my desk. Maybe a maintenance engineer position could suit me, but I also don’t have a lot of experience working on equipment. Maybe something not engineering related. Been thinking about getting into a trade, but I have my pros and cons on that.


**Am I too far along in my current career to try something else out?** I am aware that I would most likely start at the bottom of the totem pole and pay scale. I’m fine with that, I’ve done some hard saving and investing in the past few years and can handle a pay cut. But, I’ve read that getting out of the government gets hard after the five year mark.


# On “the trip”

 
During this transition, I’m going to take some time off to fulfill some long-term bike travel dreams of mine. No debt, no kids, no mortgage. House fund, e-fund, retirement all good. Not worried financially. I know the general advice is “have something else lined up before quitting your job”, but I don’t want to have to worry about heading back for a start date during the trip. I want the liberty to extend the trip if I feel like it.


I’m thinking of taking anywhere from 6 months to two years to do this, though two years seems like it could be detrimental to finding a job when I get back. I’ve done plenty of reading about finding work after having a break from work. **But, will it be extra hard for me because I’ll have the gap on my resume AND I’m looking to do something totally different AND I’m federal?**


# Addressing a few questions I believe will come up


**“Don’t you know we are in the middle of a pandemic, especially in the US?”** I do not intend to quit until this clears up, and am aware that it very well could leave a recession in the wake.
 

**“Why not just ask for unpaid leave and look for something when you get back?”** I intend to ask about this before quitting, but I have a project coming up that could last a year or more and would definitely not be granted unpaid leave until it’s over. It’s either stick the project out and hope they grant me leave after, or quit before it starts. I don’t want to leave in the middle of the project. 
 

**”You’d be crazy to give up the benefits of a government job!”** I know, but as stated above, I am straight up not having a good time right now.

My background: I have done 1D FEM for beam bending/axial loading, and 1D/2D heat conduction using FDM (the 2D was solving the Laplace Equation) amd I understand those.

We go through cycles of being very busy or very quiet, depending on how many customers we have needing systems. During the busy times we have to work late very often and also are expected to come in on weekends if extra work is needed. During one project a few years ago, it was probably close to 6 months straight that I was working until at least 7 every night (normal hours are 8-5) and probably came in on a Saturday once or twice every month. During my yearly review, there was a section for dependability and commitment to show up to work and get things done and I was given a 4/5, so I take that as they expected even more from me. 

Another time, there was even a misunderstanding between me and my boss where he expected some work to get done over the weekend and I understood it as needing to be completed at the start of the week. He sent me an email Monday morning saying that insubordination was grounds for termination. It may seem like I'm hiding details here, like there was a big fight between us and I lashed out and that's why he sent that email, but it really was just a misunderstanding. I was pretty shocked at seeing that. This is right after 3 weeks of me working until at least 8 every night for a project that I was PM on and wanted to run smoothly.

There was a document I needed to send out but I needed my boss to review it first. After he reviewed it, there were other documents I needed to make based on the first one that was checked. I sent it to him sometime around noon and reminded him about it again at the end of the day. He got back to me at 9:00pm with feedback and told me to send it out that same night. So I was expected to drop everything I was doing to make sure it got out that night.

These are just some examples. The point I'm trying to make is in general, I am expected to work very late and I feel like there's no appreciation for it. Extra PTO is never given to us to offset how many extra hours we put in, we aren't allowed to leave early during the quiet times, etc. On top of that, I have not received my yearly salary increase or bonus in 2 years because the company has not been doing well.

So my question is: How typical is this kind of work environment? I expected that engineers may have late hours, but this is just exhausting here. Do any of you work a low stress 9-5 job where you just show up, put in as much effort as you can, and then leave when you're supposed to?

An electric motor converts electrical energy (intended input) to kinetic/rotational energy (intended output). The motor can also be used as a generator or dynamo producing its intended input when the shaft is turned by whichever means. In effect this reverses the input and output.

• LEDs &amp; Solar Panels (https://youtu.be/6WGKz2sUa0w) 
• Piezoelectric crystals (e.g. buzzers)
• Speakers and microphones
• Rechargeable batteries (to an extent)

Easy enough.

So why are the engines mounted under the wing?? Surely there has to be some sort of suction created at the back of a jet engine wherein air outside of the engine gets accelerated and pulled along with the exhaust, causing it to move faster around the outside of the engine...which is under the wing.

93,"To which industy and job to switch to after 4 years in the electronics industry, looking for something more inclined to mechanical engineering",1594198689,"Hello,

I’m thinking for some time now to change the industry I’m in, but not sure in which direction to go. Sorry for a load of text, I tried to condense it as much as possible, but there is still a chunk to read.

Background: I’m a M30 with a master’s degree in mechanical engineering. 

After finishing University I worked for 1 year as a design engineer, designing wood burning stoves in SolidWorks. Then made the switch to the electronics industry as a quality assurance engineer in serial production, which I did for 3 years. After that I switched within the same company (lateral shift) to process development. I have been here for little over a year now. I was hoping from the current position to be more inclined to mechanical engineering, but it’s not. Electronics and electricity aren’t my filed of expertise and I also don’t want to become a great expert in it.

Hence, I am now thinking of changing the company and industry at the same time. However, I am not sure in which industry (or position/job) exactly to go to. Hence, I tried to write down the things I liked doing, didn’t like doing and things I would like to do in a job.

**Things I liked from my previous experiences:**

· 3D design was good, I liked learning new ways to model things and seeing the products come to life. Solving problems with the engineering department during the prototype phase was also nice.

· The few CNC milling programs I did at my first job were interesting, although I guess doing it a lot would become rather boring after some time.

· On the current position I like that its project based and that the deadlines are not breathing down my neck all the time. This allows for, most of the time, a rather relaxed working environment. 

**Things I didn’t like on my previous jobs:**

· Doing 3D design 90% of the time tends to become tedious and doesn’t require a lot of thinking when you are doing individual drawings etc.

· The quality assurance job I hated, I was in charge for too many things with constant issues popping up. It was a huge amount of stress, and you had no time to go deeper into any of the issues. It was fire-extinguishing and reporting to management.

· The current job involves too much grunt work (assistants should do more of it, but they tend to be rather incompetent unfortunately). 

· The processes we are developing are very rudimentary, it’s mostly powder coating in various forms. Neither the processes nor the trials we do are very interesting. It requires almost no mechanical engineering knowledge. Technical discussions are not common, and when we have them its mostly about electrical/chemical issues (I’m not perticularly interested in either).

**Thinks I would like to do:**

· Something with a real connection to mechanical engineering, kinematics, thermodynamics, fluids, static, etc. I really enjoyed kinematics, thermodynamics and fluids at the Uni. The working of engines, power transmissions, etc., were all interesting topics as well. 

· Some 3D design – 10-50% of the time. Writing some CNC programs in that period would also be ok. (this is not a hard must)

· Even though I am not an expert at it, some CFD or FEM simulations could also be interesting to do, but also not all the time. (Maybe I have false notions about how interesting this is, correct me if I’m wrong).

· Project based work, but without constant dead-line struggle

· I have no experience with it, but something connected with robotics or automation could be interesting

· Rather more development based, then tightly connected with a running serial production (since this is bound to be connected with super-tight deadlines and a lot of stress)

· Occasional travel to suppliers or customers would be quite ok, up to a week or two per quarter

· Ideally, something from which after 5-15 years of experience I could start my own consulting or project company.  For instance with acquiring some kind of state accreditation or the like.

· I would be willing to learn some programing, but don’t want it to be the focus of the job

98,Piston vs Turbine for theoretical steam powered machinery.,1594183188,"Evening everyone. Now this is more of a curios idea i had while thinking about a steampunk style world i've been thinking on for some time now. There's obviously going to be abundant steam power in any machine shop be it home produced or hooked up an in town steam system. 

I wanted some insight on how the machinery would translate the steam into power for any machine shop likely with a unit on the machine itself. . Here are some of my theories so far but please do elaborate further, this is more for my own curiosity and writing than any practical real world examples. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lathe (Turbine with valve):

My theory for lathe being turbine based with a valve to adjust it is that lathes technically desire speed over torque. Therefore by adjusting flow rate you can adjust the speed of the lathe in the way you can throttle an electric motor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shaper (Piston):

The long stroke of a piston would work well for a shaper. Really not much else to say.

&amp;#x200B;

Mill (Unknown): 

This one is hard for me to decide on. The mill requires torque vs speed and yet i can't see a piston working out well for it. A turbine would be easier to implement on the head but the problem is that i'm not sure if you can vary the speed with flow rate and torque with psi of the incoming steam. A piston engine while harder to implement can get more torque potentially but rpm could be an issue.

6,An Apartment Gym Question (with a Twist!),1594171577,"Hello, engineers!

Apologies if this is not a good sub for this question, but in my searches I found many posts on this topic, but they did not particularly answer my question.

Background: I live in a large, commercially managed apartment complex of timber construction in the USA. I am not on the first floor, but like these days have found myself looking for long-term fitness solutions as we weather the COVID situation. Gyms seem like a very unsafe place to be these days. I am by no means a heavy lifter; I benched about 110 before the quarantine and due to chronic injuries that I am trying to rehab, even 90 is too much for me to feel safe squatting/deadlifting.

I've done a ton of research in the last few days about how much load a residential floor must hold (40 psf common, 30 sleeping area), but I have also occasionally seen mention about a ""concentrated"" load limit, where a certain weight in small footprint would cause a failure.

I'm not worried about the 40psf, as I am dealing with a \~8x8 section of my living room (full room size is probably 20x12) that will have a static load of \~400 pounds when not lifting and \~700 when I am. I plan to keep the bumpers in a different room to lessen the load on the joists when not in use. The static load will be on 3/4"" plywood (cut into 3 sections so that I could get it into my car, if that matters), and 3/4"" high density foam [gym tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/TrafficMASTER-Black-25-4-in-x-25-4-in-x-0-68-in-Shock-Absorbing-Gym-Floor-4-Pack-24182COPLHD/301152527)

I am also not concerned about the noise, as I don't drop my weights and am relatively gentle when racking; I also plan to put foam on all bar contact points, and have thick crash pads from Rogue to soften any accidental drops.

Here is my question--as mentioned above, I am concerned about not concentrating too much weight into one spot and cause a structural failure. If:

1. [Bench](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-ab-3-adjustable-bench?bvstate=pg:2/ct:r) = 120 pounds, oriented in the X
   1. 4 points of contact--12"" apart in the Y, 52"" apart in the X
2. Lifter = 230 pounds, oriented in the X
3. Total lifted load = 205 pounds (45 [bar](https://www.roguefitness.com/the-ohio-bar-cerakote) \+ 160 plates eventually), oriented in the Y
   1. Bar is 87"" wide

How much of that load gets transferred to any given point on the floor? Are the 4 points of bench contact the only points that bear the load (I assume yes)? Does the load raise any alarms for you in a relatively recent, average timber construction?

I'm sure it's fine, but just looking for some peace of mind. I am also just curious about the math.

I asked the same quetion to FST (Freudenberg Sealing Technologies) who are an O'ring manufacturer and they said:

""Generally silicone o-rings don’t go well in silicone oils,  Nitrile should be good with silicone oils. If they are in fact using silicone o-rings in silicone oils, there maybe some additive that is being used that requires the silicone o-rings that we don’t know of.

I'm not a mechanical engineer. I'm an electronics engineer trying to pass as one. I've made a piston and cylinder, that I intend to use as a hydraulics pump. Nothing fancy, just a 1:1 pair, 2x cylinders and 2x pistons, that I want to use to actuate the gearshift lever of an outboard engine. I would expect pressure to be &lt;0.7 MPa.

I made a piston with O-ring grooves that fit nicely in a tube. All aluminium. Well not the O-ring, that's silicone.

But I can't for the life of me get it to slide in a reasonable fashion. It's either:

1. Dead stuck and needs to be pulled out with a pipe wrench
2. Sliding smoothly, but with way too much resistance
3. Full on insane stickslip, going suddenly to zero friction making me smack myself in the face.

As far as I can see, what lube I'm using changes everything. I've tried standard ball bearing grease, lithium grease, light oil, heavy oil and WD-40. It behaves differently, but not in any way that makes sense. It always ends up in scenario 1, 2 or 3. Fuck, I tried dish soap of all things, and that was the best so far. The hell?

I've also tried different surface finishes for the cylinder. From the original smooth surface produced by the extrusion process, to a polished one, a 240 grit and an 80 grit. Yup, it behaves differently with different finishes. Still not making any sense of **whyyyyy**.

As far as I can tell, the O-rings are pretty much stealing all the lubricant from the cylinder walls, scraping it completely dry. Why? I HAVE NO CLUE.

I graduated with a bachelors in manufacturing engineering technology (technology programs were all that was offered) and have been employed as a manufacturing engineer for about two years. Technology programs, of course, emphasize application rather than theory, but we still take some classes such as statics, strength of materials, and thermal and fluid dynamics (which for us was one class). I fell in love with the material and realized I would have much rather been in a mechanical engineering program, but it was my senior year and I was ready to graduate. 

2 years later, it’s still all I think about. I have just enough interest in my job to get it done but don’t want to do it the rest of life. If I stopped here, the answer would seem simple. Go back and get a degree for something you are passionate about... but **I’m not sure the job I want with the degree exists.**  I am passionate about the *tools* of engineering and not the application of those tools. Most of the good engineers I know get a hard on from “building things”, meaning they think about the end product and the tools are just a means to get to the end product. But I like the tools themselves (CAD, mechanics, thermo, etc). The best way I can describe it is a quote from the Stress Strain Analysis Wikipedia entry 

“In engineering, stress analysis is often a tool rather than a goal in itself; the ultimate goal being the design of structures and artifacts that can withstand a specified load, using the minimum amount of material or that satisfies some other optimality criterion”
 
Are there any jobs besides those in academia (although I’m not ruling it out as an option) that one can specialize in where the tools of engineering are the goal and not the means to the goal? I will be reaching out to some local engineers and professors from the local university in hopes to ask them these same questions, but I wanted to post here also. If my search is unfruitful, I’m going to take the education I have and go back to the family trade of construction. It’s something I have interest in and can make comparable money to what I am making now, and I have a great teachers in my family.

I am currently job hunting and am in the interview stage for a company I am considering. I've received instructions the presentation that is expected from me for this interview and I sense red flags and reluctance to continue the process. Is this really reasonable?

Background: This is a relatively small \~100 person company, government contractor working on R&amp;D proposals. I am fairly reluctant on this company at this point, but it's the furthest along opportunity I have so far. The opportunity only partially aligns with my goals, and I've sensed several red flags so far in learning about the company.

\- Talking to a software engineer sounding fairly exasperated and admitting they are overworked

\- Talking with a director who when I ask at the start of the call ""How are you"", responds with ""confused and dazed"" as a result from managing so many projects. Dude, I appreciate the honesty I guess? But you are not selling the company or position

\- My general perception of the company is one that bids on many proposals and takes on more then they can chew, and scrambles to deliver on the ones they win, with a lack of engineering rigor.

I've had technical engineering interviews before, including ones that require a presentation on myself and/or a project I've worked on, ranging from 15 minutes to an hour. I get that, it makes sense, and I even had some fun making those. This company, in addition to that, is asking for me to come up with a sample proposal for a government R&amp;D topic, including sample sketches, schedules, costs, calculations, background research, etc... And to have it done 3 days from now.

I estimate this would easily require 8+ hours of work to make a quality presentation. It feels like I am being exploited for free labor, and this is just a hint of things to come and reflective of how this company operates, placing little value on employees well-being. The role I am applying for is not a project manager, it is to develop some control software (albeit take on some more responsibility than I've had before). 

I suppose a benefit of the culture and work environment of this company would be gaining entrepreneurial style experience, writing proposals and seeking out new work. But that doesn't interest me, I am currently seeking to continue broadening my technical skills.

This seems ridiculous, I have other phone screens to prep for, and other technical skills to sharpen. I am not a workaholic and I don't want to become one. Should I go through with this for the experience? Or decline and move on? And if the latter, is there any point to offer a reason for declining, or just say no and move on? Am I just whining and should I just suck it up, or are these legitimate red flags?

44,How is it possible to reduce the weight of small modular reactors?,1594125872,"Hi everybody,

I have designed a crewed interstellar spacecraft called Solar One.

It employs a combination of 3 propulsion methods: nuclear fusion, beam-powered propulsion , and photon propulsion.

Basically, several compact fusion reactors power a laser system that propels a huge light sail.

Physicist Robert Forward already proposed in 1983 to use a 26-TW laser system to propel a 100-km light sail, a fresnel lens to focus the beam of the laser, and decelerate the spacecraft with a secondary light sail.

I propose something a bit different, which is to use to use for example a 60 TW-laser to propel a 5-km light sail that would deploy from the spacecraft after the acceleration stage, use parabolic mirrors that gradually change their orientation in order to focus the laser beam, and finally use a photon rocket to decelerate the spacecraft.

In theory, it could be possible to achieve 25% the speed of light, reaching the closest potentially habitable exoplanet in less than 20 years.

There are of course many challenges, like building high-energy continuous-wave lasers, reducing the weight of the nuclear fusion reactors (and of course achieving effective nuclear fusion first), and minimizing the effects of zero gravity during such a long trip.

I graduated with a BS in Mech. Engineering about a year ago and have been working at my current job ever since. I like the job in the sense that I get to work on large commercial projects in NYC, but it is insanely stressful. The company I work for does not have much of an infrastructure so many aspects of the commercial HVAC business, outside of project management, (estimating, purchasing, field supervision, etc.) becomes my responsibility. I'm constantly getting yelled at by GC's and have to deal with foreman with shitty attitudes, and the Senior PM that I have been assigned to give me next to zero guidance. Even though my title is ""assistant"" PM, I do all of the work that a regular project manager does. All the senior PM does is show up to job sites and tells me what to do with no help at all. On top of all of this I normally have to work anywhere from 10-12 hours a day while I'm paid salary with no OT. I've tried going to the owner of the company and was basically blown off... overall my current situation is a nightmare.

A career path that I have grown an interest in is working as a sales engineer. I like the idea of having a job where I can apply what I learned with my degree while also using more personal skills/communication in a business setting. The only downside to this is that not many sales engineer openings I see are for selling HVAC/mechanical equipment. Most are for software sales which I am not qualified for since I went to school for ME.

What I am most concerned about is that I have backed myself into a corner by starting out in construction.

75,Materials Engineers. What is the current status of metals used for Nuclear applications?,1594083597,"TLDR: Are there any metals or is there research on metals that can handle 

Neutron Flux: 10^15cm^3/s
Pressure: ~1,000 psig
Surface Temperature fluctuation: 20°C-~650°C
Helium Embrittlement issues
Time: 60-80 years 





So I’m a Nuclear Engineer, and one of the projects I worked on in school was a Helium-Cooled fast reactor design. I was the head of materials and worked a bit with a PhD student who specialized in steels for Nuclear applications. The general Helium-Cooled reactor design is actually an amazing design. Very safe and potentially low cost. However, as the materials guy, I ran into the major issue. I needed a pressure vessel that could withstand a neutron flux around the 10^15 n/cm^3/s and was also to be resistant to Helium embrittlement, and could operate at a pressure of 1,000 psig and had a maximum surface temperature of around 650°C, and could handle cooling to 20°C when shutdown. This pressure vessel was also expected to last no less than 60-80 years. 

Initially, I looked into a SS-304 variant as SS from what I read was supposed to be capable of those kinds of temperatures, and is fairly resistant to Helium embrittlement, however after discussion with the grad student, he said that the SS304 becomes increasingly brittle under those types of temperature fluctuations and is further accelerated by the neutron damage. Another issue that arrises is the Ductile to Brittle Transformation temperatures actually move upward from neutron damage in any materials which contain nickel or copper, which is contained in most welds. What I ended up doing was choosing an A509 steel and slapping a cooling system on the Pressure vessel to ensure the walls didn’t exceed the ASME standard for temperature. But this caused issues with the efficiency of the plant and I didn’t know enough to determine whether or not this could last the minimum 60 years, although my DBTT equations “said” it could. At the end of the design, the grad student applauded my section for being the one of “closest to feasible designs of that style of reactor that he has seen.”

Something I learned from the whole experience is that when it comes to materials, most of the engineering lies within the actual testing phase and you can only calculate so much.

So my question is. Is anyone currently researching steels in this category and have there been any new technologies or new materials developed recently that allow these metals to deal with insane conditions like the one this plant has.",AskEngineers,False,Schnieds1427,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hmkmfs/materials_engineers_what_is_the_current_status_of/

Most of my job is copying designs, trying to balance many projects, and meeting hard deadlines. I'm starting to dislike it to the point that its stressing me out even when I'm not working. 

Before this, I was working for a small company as a field engineer for a year and a half, and I enjoyed being able to work in substation maintenance (relays, circuit breakers, transformers, etc.). However, I left because work was slow due to the company's lack of clients and I thought there was a stigma on being a field engineer. 

In the long run, I want to start a family and settle down so the travel and weekend/holiday work that comes with being a field engineer/technician would get old. I'm worried that it would be hard to transition to an engineering job working for a utility if I work as a field engineer/technician for a few years. From what I've heard/read, utility work seems to have a better work/life balance as well as being less stressful.

Some additional background: I graduated with a BSEE at the end of 2017, so I'm still pretty early in my career and am in my mid 20s. 

**My questions are:** 

1. Would it be a bad career move to go back to the field and work as a field engineer/technician? I've been reading different job descriptions for field engineers and field technicians and they sound the same. 
2. Should I stay in my current job for at least two years so it doesn't look like I'm job hopping?

I can manage constructing the tubes myself, but I'm unsure of what's next. I'm planning on attaching a 10RPM 24V DC motor with very high gear reduction for rotating said tube. I could attach the motor to the stationary bottom tube or to the rotating tube. I think the stationary tube would be the best.

Now this is what led to my question. I don't know a good way of rotating the tube with the motor. I thought of attaching a spur gear to another gear which goes around the tube, but gears of that size are surprisingly expensive.

Another idea I had was attaching a bicycle gear to both the tube and the motor with a bicycle chain connecting the two. Since the gear are not in direct contact with each other I'm thinking that any torque applied to either the motor gear or tube would result in the motor shaft bending. This problem wouldn't happen with touching gears. The same thing goes for a drive belt.

I need the gears to be able to sustain a high amount of torque. And the best way for this would be spur gears I think, but the cost of it dissuades me. I can get bicycle gears and a chain for free but again, I think this would bring the shaft bending problem with it since the motor is not that big and neither is the output shaft.

85,How is it possible to reduce the weight of small modular sreactors?,1594071347,"Hi everybody,

I have designed a crewed interstellar spacecraft called Solar One.

It employs a combination of 3 propulsion methods: nuclear fusion, beam-powered propulsion , and photon propulsion.

Basically, several compact fusion reactors power a laser system that propels a huge light sail.

Physicist Robert Forward already proposed in 1983 to use a 26-TW laser system to propel a 100-km light sail, a fresnel lens to focus the beam of the laser, and decelerate the spacecraft with a secondary light sail.

I propose something a bit different, which is to use to use for example a 60 TW-laser to propel a 5-km light sail that would deploy from the spacecraft after the acceleration stage, use parabolic mirrors that gradually change their orientation in order to focus the laser beam, and finally use a photon rocket to decelerate the spacecraft.

In theory, it could be possible to achieve 25% the speed of light, reaching the closest potentially habitable exoplanet in less than 20 years.

There are of course many challenges, like building high-energy continuous-wave lasers, reducing the weight of the nuclear fusion reactors (and of course achieving effective nuclear fusion first), and minimizing the effects of zero gravity during such a long trip.

I need a little bit of help. I'm an Aerospace Engineer with a Bachelor's Degree and want to change careers. I'm not challenged in my work, and in fact, I foresee certain aspects of my job as prone to automation within the far future. I make a good living, and live a comfortable and safe life. But, this ""white-picket fence, 9-5 routine"" isn't really doing it for me anymore.

In addition, the industry within I work is not conducive to certain life goals of mine.

These goals are:

* Start and operate a business which can withstand five years of operation (doesn't matter if it turns a profit or not; I just want to wet my chops with the stakes involved in risking a business venture)

* High level management

* $1M or more in assets before retirement in 30-40 years (definitely doable with my current 401k/ roth contributions but I'd like to get there faster, and with integrity)

* I would settle on a job in the space industry if all else can't be achieved

This is what a career move should provide:

* An industry or job which is conducive to starting a business (low barrier to entry, tech related)

* An industry or job that is highly technical/ cutting edge

*Work that is highly visible and challenging

* Work that would provide inspiration for creating a business that could solve a problem

* Live and work in a large midwestern city, such as Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Omaha, Des Moines, St. Louis. I'd consider Denver too, but Chicago is at the top of my list.

Things that I like to do:

* Math (I sometimes do structural and aerodynamics analysis, but the frequency of these tasks is too few and far-between)

* Numbers

* Design

* Music

* Money (I like to read SEC reports and use them to pick stocks)

* Coding

* Leading

I've targeted a few career fields which I think might be conducive to these goals, and all of which I'm confident in my ability to succeed:

* Electrical/ Computer/ Software Engineering

* Cyber security

* Finance

**Questions:**

* Are there other career fields which I've missed, that would align with the goals/ enjoyable tasks stated above?

* Should I consider grad school?

94,"Not sure where to ask this, I can't find an answer anywhere. Should instrument accuracy affect the acceptable range when measuring a device with a certain tolerance? I'm an intern trying to understand how this works but my boss isn't being super helpful.",1594060856,"Hello! I'm an intern currently in Quality Engineering (I know, I know), and I was performing an audit when I stumbled upon this webpage: (summary below if you don't want to read)  [https://www.keyence.com/ss/products/measure/measurement\_library/basic/tolerance/#:\~:text=Tolerance%20refers%20to%20the%20total%20allowable%20error%20within%20an%20item.&amp;text=In%20this%20way%2C%20tolerance%20is,occur%20at%20any%20given%20step.](https://www.keyence.com/ss/products/measure/measurement_library/basic/tolerance/#:~:text=Tolerance%20refers%20to%20the%20total%20allowable%20error%20within%20an%20item.&amp;text=In%20this%20way%2C%20tolerance%20is,occur%20at%20any%20given%20step.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Which to me makes sense. This is my understanding of it using a simpler example: It is basically saying that for example, you receive a product, and in order for you to accept it, the length has to be 10 inches, with a tolerance of + or - 1inch. So theoretically, the acceptable range is 9 inches to 11 inches. But then you use a measuring instrument with an accuracy of + or - 0.5 inch. If you use this instrument and get 11 inches, you should not pass it, because the true value (based on the instrument's accuracy) can be anywhere from 10.5 inch to 11.5 inch. By that logic, the actual acceptable range for that product using this specific instrument should be from 9.5 inch to 10.5, this way even if the instrument is at its worst case scenario, every piece of product is guaranteed acceptable (assuming the instrument is calibrated).

&amp;#x200B;

But my boss is saying that if we are measuring something with say width of 0.100 and tolerance of say 0.005, as long as the instrument's tolerance goes one place further, say 0.0005, then we are good and the acceptable range is still just 0.095 to 0.105. But I feel like even in this scenario we still need to take the accuracy into account and have the actual acceptable range be from 0.0955 to 0.1045.

My boss said that since the tolerance is only 0.005, then it doesn't matter what happens in the digits after that, so if we get anything that is 0.105X, whether that is 0.1050 or 0.1059 then it passes, which is the only way I could see the caliper accuracy being a non-factor as long as it has more decimal places for accuracy than we need tolerance, but that really doesn't sound right to me.

--------//-------//--------//-------//

Today I'm quite saddened. Saddened, disappointed and frustrated that my 6 month internship at ""Company X"" is nearly over. It has been 6 frustrating months with ups and downs and with long intervals between experience of success. 

I'm an automation engineer student graduating in September 2020 and Company X was my dream company and first priority when hunting for an internship. It's a renowned international company and a market leader in their field and the competition to get a spot was quite fierce. Dozens of my fellow classmates from our university alone had applied and they had only room for two interns. After a pleasant interview I got one of the spots and was told that I was their first pick. The thing is, once you're ""in"" in Company X, you're most likely secured a job if you do well. Statistically, 7 out of 10 interns gets a full time position after their internship.

So you can imagine how happy I was! I was almost in tears of joy. :-D

Fast forward to today and I'm feeling like crap. Not only didn't I get a position after my newly job interview at Company X but the internship was nothing like I had imagined. Nowhere near it.

I would like to state that we landed amidst a big reorganization as a handful of key individuals had left the company. I would also like to state that it is my impression that Company X wanted the best for us. They had an overseas trip to a site and different quality courses planned for us but then Covid-19 hit. But even prior to Covid-19 we felt that the management in our specific department was severely lacking. I got the impression that this wasn't the case in the company's other branches (they also had interns).

A long story short: At first, we were given two assignments:

Project A): An in-house project. We had to build a machine almost from scratch. It was a leftover project that was stranded on a desk (ours) as the guy in charge of the project had left the company two weeks prior to our first day at the office. None of us interns had any knowledge about mechanical engineering but there was an engineer assigned as our project leader. However, it quickly turned out that he didn't have the time or ressources to help us out - and he wasn't a mechanical engineer either. We were alone and this assignment quickly got shelved/put on hold by the manager. We ""wasted 4 weeks"". Alright, moving on to the next plan.

Project B): This was also an in-house project with a higher priority but with no strict deadline. Now, this assignment was very exciting but also highly complex as we had to dig deep into a system that has taken 3 years and hundreds of man hours to develop. A mentor was assigned to us, the system architect, highly knowledgeable person with years of experience and very likeable - however he was very busy and was only available sporadically. He also left the company midway. Again, we were stranded with no mentor and no real plan. Halfway through my internship my companion also decided to leave as he assessed that he wouldn't gain anything valuable from it any longer. He terminated his contract and decided to do his own project. 

I went to HR to tell them the situation. Before all of this, me and my companion had meetings with our (former) manager and told him that we needed weekly meetings and 1-on-1 once per week or every other week. Nothing really happened. My former manager is a very likable individual but he is a little too loose and distractedly. 

So, I went to HR with a written report that stated what we have experienced as interns, what we liked and what we've missed. HR took it very well and were actually pretty surprised how lacking our division has been in taking care of us. So, I got another manager, he's cool, we got 1-on-1 meetings every two weeks and a stand-up meeting every week. But he doesn't know much about my assignment, no one really does, as I'm still trying to decipher lines and lines of code that was written within a ""black box solution"". 

So, why am I still there? Well, I wanted more experience so I stayed and even prolonged the period by a month. HR and my manager welcomed it and I also hoped that it would give me better chances to land a job at Company X. Weeks went by and suddenly there was an open position.

So, I applied for an open position in my division. However, due to Covid-19 crisis they had to put that open position on hold. My application was still in the pool and two weeks later I'm called in for an interview as there was an open position in another division. 

Even though I was an intern in the company and most of them already knew me, I still had to undergo personality and logical tests along with a case. I felt the interview went fine. Actually, very fine. My only fear was that I didn't really click with the manager from the other division - even prior to the interview. We are very different - he's very outgoing, some would even say loud and I'm the opposite. I'm very social but I'm also low key, if that makes sense?

Well, a week ago I was told that I wasn't fit for the position. He (the manager) liked my profile, I didn't say anything wrong but I didn't have the experience required and they didn't have the time to get me aligned with the rest of the team. I nodded, said I'm sorry for their decision but thanked them for the opportunity. 

I was devastated. I've never been late, no sick days, been proactive and kept my spirit high at all times. Coming in early and one of the last ones to leave. I gave it my all 

To be honest, I thought it was BS. They've screened my CV. They knew how experienced I was. Also, my perspective is that they were the ones who should have given me the necessary experience. 
My guess is that the manager just didn't see me fitting in. The funny thing is that I have very good chemistry with the rest of the team. They were surprised I didn't get the position. 
To make matters worse, I recently learned that a classmate of mine has been called in for an interview. For the exact same position. He is, in my humble opinion, in no way more experienced than me or as qualified. I wish him the best but I just don't buy their reason for the rejection.

I asked HR for feedback on my interview immediately after I was rejected. What I could have done differently. If I said anything wrong or didn't sell myself well enough.
HR said my application, CV and interview was flawless. I did nothing wrong. I'm very transparent, open and likeable. I said to myself, ""then wtf didn't get the job?!""...

I'm confused. Confused, sad, disappointed, frustrated and mad. Not at anyone particular - just the situation. 

This was my chance to get my foot inside the circle. Now, I'm just a soon to be graduate with not enough experience in the bag.

20,Question Regarding Hole Limit Designations,1594036135,"Might be a bit of a stupid question, but for some reason I’ve been stuck on this for a while now. I’m dealing with a tolerance issue from a previous design (not mine) that had too much of a gap in tolerance regarding a press-fit bearing and the hole it goes into. 

The bearing we use has a larger tolerance than I’m used to seeing in a bearing (outer race is +.001/-.000). However, I’m having trouble finding out what the tolerance should be for the bore. Using the Machinery’s Handbook chart regarding housing bore limits from basic outside dia. of shaft, I’m trying to determine what hole limit designation I need to use. This technically would be for a shaft, but I thought it could be applicable to a bearing as well which may end up being my issue here.  At first, I thought I would need to use the H7 designation given the race tolerance, but I’m not convinced I’m using this chart correctly and I can’t find anything on the vendor’s site that could tell me/hint at what the bore size should be for this particular bearing. 

Is there something I’m missing/doing incorrectly here? Or is there another resource I can use specifically for bore sizes with bearings? I feel like this is such a simple problem and yet I’m struggling with it. I’ve been a design engineer for less than two years, but have had more than a few successful designs make its way into our catalogue. Yet I’m stumped on a simple hole. 

Bearing is an LM11910 tapered roller bearing.

It's for a position that I'm very thankful for (Robotics Software Engineer), because in my country investment in Robotics is tiny in comparison to other countries. So landing this job was a ""miracle"", and it's the field I want to work in.

My degree however is in Mechanical Engineering, however throughout my degree I have been taking all the optional computing courses, I made my dissertation focus in mechatronics, as well as mechatronics for my master's projects. 

The company I'll be working for is a startup. They even wanted me to start early, in the middle of my exam season, because they needed my help. (This made me feel like an imposter even more).

The pay is pretty low too, very under average, so I'm hoping this work experience can boost me into something more sustainable in the future.

I thought of ideas for improving digital cameras in general. This inspired to think of ideas for improving smartphone digital camera systems. This is based on realistic scenarios.

**The features include:**

* Ability to install 3rd party plugins for the default camera app
* The default app can be set in simple or advanced mode. It can warn about settings that are not recommended and what's for advanced users.
* Phone disables notifications by default for video.
* Show a grid that guides for different aspect ratios like 2x3 and 4x3. The grids can also have composition guidelines **in addition** to rule of thirds.
* Spirit level to prevent crooked horizons
* Optical image stabilization will be a given.
* Ability to slide on external filters like polarizers and ND.
* White balance bracketing for JPEG and video. The user can select a bracket then create a LUT to remap the color balance later. It'll be useful for candle light scenes.
* Ability to tap to select what areas are and are not worth factoring in for exposure purposes.
* Ability to use **lock and compensate**. It works where if one setting affecting exposure value is adjusted, another one is adjusted to cancel the change in EV.
* Ability to lock then adjust EV values.
* Ability to tap to select what points you want in focus and out of focus.
* Internal xenon flash with support for external flash. Ideally, the internal flash should be designed to prevent red eye. An idea includes having the internal flash beam up inside then get spread out when emitted. The next best thing is to use an easily attachable external flash that can be repositioned on a bracket system. Color balancing gels can be installed as needed. If feasible, an internal time of flight sensor can be used to determine distance and automatically adjust flash power.
* Quad pixel phase detect autofocus
* Use an array of small sensors to small lenses to achieve the effect of a large sensor and lens. Each array will have a periscope enabled optical zoom. There will be an array for standard focal length, wide angle, moderate telephoto, and 180 degree fisheye. All 4 arrays will have adjustable focal lengths **without** protruding components. The code for the blending will be licensed on the basis of ""use but don't modify.""
* Continuously adjustable apertures
* Dual base ISO gap of 4 stops (like ISO 50 and ISO 1600). It will be used for scenes with extreme gaps between bright and dark. Usefulness for low dynamic range low light scenes will be a given.
* The ISO can go up to at least 1 million yet look clean. It'll be useful for video recording on starry nights.
* Internal ND filter that can be switched on.
* In sensor frame averaging for still and video. In each pixel, there will be a buffer and processor for storing and averaging the values after the A/D conversion (making the original 1s and 0s) but **before** saving to storage. This is to produce forerunner of longer exposures and slower shutter speeds.
* Recording to near lossless RAW for still and video. Recordings with dual ISO reconstruction can have it adjusted after recording.
* Ability to ""push and pull"" for RAW. It's for those who ""expose to the left or right."" The factor can be set at the scene or in post
* Ability to have lossy pre-demosaiced RAW that's downsampled to save storage. It'll can be used for still and especially video. The latter will be done with LongGOP compression.
* Support for downsampled material before it's time to process the original in storage. It'll be called **smart draft mode**.

79,Electrical Engineering vs Engineering Physics,1593935592,"This is crossposted with AskPhysics. I didn't see anything about crossposting in the rules for this sub, but if it's not allowed please let me know and I'll just remove this post. If it's no problem I would greatly appreciate your perspectives as engineers!

This is a bit long; if you'd rather not read all of it I've put a TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm really struggling to decide between EE &amp; Engineering Physics. From what I've read a physics degree, even Engineering Physics, is not as employable. In fact, the Engineering Physics degree at my school is not even ABET accredited. This accreditation is crucial for engineering jobs; I read somewhere that employers may not even look at applications that lack this accreditation.

On the other hand, I really don't know what direction I want to take in my life. Electrical Engineering would set me up for a job straight out of undergrad (presumably), which is great, but what if I would be happier pursuing graduate studies in Physics for a research career? I just don't know yet whether I want to go to grad school. A part of me wants to do it because I find physics fascinating, and being a researcher sounds like a great career for me. (I say it ""sounds"" that way because I have no clue what it actually entails, of course.) If any part of me wants to do EE, it's the practical part of me that wants to find a stable, well-paying job without the huge commitment of getting a PhD, which is needed for physics research. I would likely not even need a Master's with a BS in EE, though I might go back and get it later after a few years in industry- but then my company might pay for it, so it's still much less of an opportunity cost than the physics PhD.

Another consideration is that I could probably complete a BS in Engineering Physics and then go for a Master's in a practical engineering discipline to get a solid job. In that case, having engineering knowledge supplemented by a physics background might actually give me an edge in some respects (most likely quantum), although it might be a disadvantage in others- I've heard many engineers get MBAs later on, and I don't know how this would work if I started in physics. A BS in physics, then MS in engineering right after undergrad, then an MBA on top of that after a few years of work? Well anyway, I'm getting a bit carried away. The point is, there are many moving pieces to consider and I don't know how to choose. So here's my question (and also the TL;DR):

TL;DR: Essentially, my question is- as someone who isn't sure whether they want to do graduate studies for a research career, or just get a solid job right out of undergrad, would it be best to choose the less practical Engineering Physics degree, which might give me more grad school options, or just go with practicality from the outset and choose Electrical Engineering?

I would appreciate any guidance. Thanks!",AskEngineers,False,Jreddit72,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hliw5b/electrical_engineering_vs_engineering_physics/

While I am hopeful for a recovery of the job market, I know that it is wise to prepare for an uphill battle. What can I do other than the normal ""work hard, do projects, and apply""? 

My pros:

\-Landed a great internship this summer at a company that I'd love to work for. While they are growing rapidly and have government contracts, I know that it is not wise to rely on getting a job offer from them. 

\-President of the ham radio club at school

\-Have plenty of hands on experience

\-Love electronics as a hobby, not just as a job

\-I have aviation experience which is a field that I would like to work within

My cons:

\-Majoring in Electrical Engineering Tech, not BSEE. I sure wish I went BSEE but transferred into engineering. I am doing my best to make up any deficiencies of ET with more self-teaching. Not worth going back and doing BSEE at this point. 

\-2.99 GPA. I had health issues earlier in my undergrad and I took my basics at community college and the GPA did not transfer. I get get a 4.0 this last semester though! 

\-I go to a small school. While my school has a good engineering program, it is not really known of in the broader engineering world outside some select fields.

90,Please poke holes in my design for a temperature controlled sealed 3D printer enclosure with HEPA filtration and flame suppression system.,1593910877,"I'm designing a workbench/cabinet to house my Sidewinder X1 3D printer and was hoping to elicit some feedback before moving forward with my design. I've attached a rough sketch of what I'm hoping to ultimately build, with specifics below. At this stage I'm hoping some engineering-minded people can poke holes in my project before I go blowing money on it. I don't have the space nor the ability to vent to a window, hence the built in filtration. [Design sketch here.](https://imgur.com/a/SYQYWKa)

**Notes for those unfamiliar with 3D printing:**

* Different plastics require different build plate and chamber temperatures. The build plate will be the heat source as it easily reaches 100°C.
* Different plastics put off varying amounts of VOCs, requiring the HEPA and activated carbon filters in lieu of an open window (which would also introduce humidity as a downside).
* The entire thing needs to be enclosed to keep my mischievous cat out.

**CONSTRUCTION:**

* Wood construction with a [flame-retardant additive](https://www.amazon.com/Flamecheck-M-111PA-Retardant-Additive-Gallon/dp/B084BN3CH8/) in the stain/paint and foil tape in the printer chamber.
* Doors with windows, and LED lighting to minimize the need to open it.
* Dry storage chamber above the printer with filament racks and [silica gel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z8ZYJ75/) to reduce the humidity.
* A filtration and vent chamber below the printer.
* General tool storage or TBD space below the filter chamber.

**AIR FILTERING/HVAC:**

* Using off the shelf [HEPA and activated carbon filters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N8SQSYA/) to trap as much of the VOC and particulate exhaust as possible (I have pets and don't want to risk their health).
* The filters are a near perfect fit for 3x 120mm fans side by side, I'm still waiting to hear back from the manufacturer about the static pressure of the filters- presuming it comes in under a certain threshold I think I can find pc radiator fans that should meet the requirements. If it's a higher static pressure than expected I'll have to completely rethink this part.
* A hot air exhaust and cool air inlet, both with gravity shutters, with fans connected to a [media center cooling controller](https://www.acinfinity.com/component-cooling/cabinet-fan-systems/airplate-t7-home-theater-and-av-quiet-cabinet-cooling-fan-system-12-inch)\- this way I can set the fans to trigger when the print chamber goes above a desired temperature. These will be *after* the filtering stage.
* A separate tube for inlet and exhaust of the printer's electronics, which has vents on either side of the main body. I think a small exhaust fan inside the unit should be sufficient to keep it cool.

**SAFETY:**

* The printer has thermal runaway protection on the build plate, which is AC powered.
* A smoke detector near the cabinet.
* An arduino with a [flame detector](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/SURYATEJA/arduino-modules-flame-sensor-6322fb) above the printer that can cut power and trigger a fire suppression system- a [paintball co2 tank](https://www.amazon.com/Tippmann-40020-Aluminum-Paintball-Tank/dp/B0008G2WAW) connected to an arduino powered [solenoid](https://www.amazon.com/Normally-Pneumatic-Aluminum-Electric-Solenoid/dp/B01M0UEISP/) with tubing running to the build chamber, using printed parts to direct co2 flow to the near-side base of the build plate, in the same way you would use a co2 fire extinguisher. For simplicities sake and out of an abundance of caution it won't have a regulator, once it trips it'll keep pumping co2 until the tank is empty.

Recently I have become tired of my job, I'm running out of motivation due to the huge amount of documentation (validation protocols, FMEAS, SOP, etc) it involves and also my technical skills are suffering a lot.

This company has grown a lot due to the COVID-19 pandemic and it's developing a lot of processes as molding, extrusion, ultrasonic welding to comply with the ramp up. I've seen this as an opportunity to switch to a more technical role as a process development engineer, but there is a lot of resistance from management because I lack the proper technical skills.

Any advice? 

Regards and hope all of you are doing well.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: I've been seeking for more technical positions in other companies but due to the economic crisis, seems I will be here for a while. Also, professional training is not currently available due to the pandemic.

9,"Can we actually make a ""flux capacitor""?",1593893165,"What would this even entail conceptually?

 My EM knowledge isn't as sharp as I'd like, but I feel like if we could design a (completely) sherical capacitor that would satisfy this idea.

And if teleportation becomes practically possible, one could be designed this way. 

Where one side of the capacitor comes from a sphererical shell sorrounding, but not touching, another oppositely charged sphere. If teleportation can be used to connect the center of the inner sphere to the rest of the circuit attached to the outer shell. 

(By my reckoning this could, possibly, be a capacitor of ~~Infinite~~ continuous surface area, at least in a meta sort of way)

17,Career - Still lost,1593878797,"This honestly seems like the best place to ask all this.

&amp;#x200B;

A little about me -

Age - 26

Degree - BSEE at a top 10 engineering uni

GPA - 2.9

Experience - 2.5 years at a large MEP/Utility consulting firm and currently \~2 years at a large Defense firm (Lockheed, Raytheon)

&amp;#x200B;

Concerns and next steps:

The site I currently work at really has no up-ward mobility for EEs. There are literally 3 electrical engineers on the site since it's a predominately mechanical product. Initially when I worked at an MEP/Utility house - I thought I disliked power systems work so I ended up looking at a more Power Electronics/Analog/Mixed Signal design job. It turns out that I don't like that either. I have just enough passion to do my job well and get great performance reviews but not enough passion to think I can do this long term &gt;5+ years.

&amp;#x200B;

What sort of careers path can I take/What exit strategy is there in terms of options? I don't vest fully  (401k, relocation) until EOY 2021 so I will still be here until then.  Should I take another engineering design position in commercial? Should I change my career completely?

I started looking at appealing career options:

1. Product Manager
2. Investment Analysis
3. Energy Consultant
4. Strategy Consulting

I started looking into advanced degrees that can help me get there but the sticker price of a top 20 MBA turned me off ($120-180k). I started looking at other degree options and stumbled upon a pretty good online option (Masters in Eng Management - UTAustin, UCLA, Northwestern).  Is M-EngM even worth it or is it a ""useless"" degree?

So here's my questions:

1. Should I give up my flexible, cushiony, stable design engineering job and take on $50k of debt to pursue a Masters in Engineering Management? Will I even get in with my low GPA (I barely skirt by with a 3.15 in my last 2 years of Ugrad). Is the degree even worth it?
2. Should I stay at my job 3-5 years in knowing that I don't know whether I can stay long term (stuck due to no upward mobility and 2-3% raises per year and maybe 1 promotion (5-7%))
3. Should I leave this job and apply to another engineering job when I fully vest (EOY 2021)?",AskEngineers,False,mrbadshad,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hl5qp1/career_still_lost/

30,Update: Deck beam connection in a cramped space,1593835624,"A couple days ago I made [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/hi78f7/deck_beam_connection_in_a_cramped_space/) asking for advice on how to make a post for a deck being built over a set of concrete steps.

Based on some advice in that thread (thank you /u/ChopBustin101 for the idea) I remade the design using two layers of pressure-treated plywood, anchored into the steps using lag-shield concrete anchors.

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/HxyEEIo)

In this method I was able to change the beam into a 2-ply 2x8 setup, which left 1.25"" of space between the beam and the steps. The only pressure-treated plywood of an acceptable size I could find was 15.5mm, making the two layers 1.22"" high. To help fill the gap and to provide some water protection for the plywood in the centre, I put in a sheet of aluminum which is just shy of the nominal gap thickness. I figure at these scales and tolerances it won't matter if it's 5 thou off... It also allows a tiny bit of breathing room between the beam and the plywood on the edges of the pad, hopefully it'll help it dry there.

I'm using 5/16"" long lag-shield concrete anchors and 3.5"" bolts and some washers to hold the plywood in place in the concrete. They've been spaced properly in between and to the concrete edge according to [this source](https://www.concretefasteners.com/technical-specifications-lag-shield-anchor/).

The beam is attached to the plywood via a set of 2""x4"" 12-gauge steel angles. Angles are attached to the top level of plywood using 1/4"" bolts and to the beam using 1/4"" lag screws. The screws are currently just 1"" long, I may increase it to 1.25"" but they shouldn't be holding much load anyway.

My main concern with this design is that I live in a climate with cold winters and thus water freezing is always a threat. If water seeps into the holes for the anchors I'm worried it may be enough to split the concrete apart. I'm planning to use thread sealer and maybe some caulk around the shaft of the anchor prior to pushing it into the hole, do you think that will be enough?

I understand that it would be better if I could just rip the concrete steps out completely, but that's not within the scope of the project, and the ground moves too much around the steps for posts secured to the ground to work.

33,"Is there a specialty for me, or should I switch careers?",1593834487,"Thanks for reading in advance. I don’t know how to ask this without a fair amount of context, so here goes. 

I graduated with a bachelors in manufacturing engineering technology (technology programs were all that was offered) and have been employed as a manufacturing engineer for about two years. Technology programs, of course, emphasize application rather than theory, but we still take some classes such as statics, strength of materials, and thermal and fluid dynamics (which for us was one class). I fell in love with the material and realized I would have much rather been in a mechanical engineering program, but it was my senior year and I was ready to graduate. 

2 years later, it’s still all I think about. I have just enough interest in my job to get it done but don’t want to do it the rest of life. If I stopped here, the answer would seem simple. Go back and get a degree for something you are passionate about... but **I’m not sure the job I want with the degree exists.**  I am passionate about the *tools* of engineering and not the application of those tools. Most of the good engineers I know get a hard on from “building things”, meaning they think about the end product and the tools are just a means to get to the end product. But I like the tools themselves (CAD, mechanics, thermo, etc). The best way I can describe it is a quote from the Stress Strain Analysis Wikipedia entry 

“In engineering, stress analysis is often a tool rather than a goal in itself; the ultimate goal being the design of structures and artifacts that can withstand a specified load, using the minimum amount of material or that satisfies some other optimality criterion”
 
Are there any jobs besides those in academia (although I’m not ruling it out as an option) that one can specialize in where the tools of engineering are the goal and not the means to the goal? I will be reaching out to some local engineers and professors from the local university in hopes to ask them these same questions, but I wanted to post here also. If my search is unfruitful, I’m going to take the education I have and go back to the family trade of construction. It’s something I have interest in and can make comparable money to what I am making now, and I have a great teachers in my family.

48,ICE Exhaust - distance of crossover from exhaust port,1593816312,"Every article I read and video I see tells me that the closer the crossover tube or collector is to the cylinder head, the lower in the RPM range it's going to have an effect.

This to me makes zero sense.

Let's take the example of an inline twin with a crossover tube further away from the exhaust port. Exhaust pulses from cylinder #1 should take longer to travel to the crossover point and induce a negative pressure wave in cylinder #2. So, in effect, a crossover tube further down the exhaust manifold should have a more noticeable effect at low RPMs since it has more time to match the intake stroke in the other cylinder.

Similarly, a crossover tube closer to the cylinder head means the negative pressure pulse due to the exhaust of cylinder #1 passing the crossover reaches the exhaust port of cylinder #2 sooner, hence being more effective at higher RPMs.

I have a robotic lawn mower that I am having a problem with.

The mower can no longer find it's way back to the charging station. When it is time to go back to the charging station, it will go the wire, sense the wire, and then drive over it and stop. It can sense the wire, but it cannot follow it along for some reason.

I had opened it up previously to fix a broken wheel hub, but I am not sure if I pulled out the radio signal wire. It can still sense the wire, and when it is just mowing, when it comes to the wire it will turn around.

Below is a link to a video showing the problem.

55,What would you do with your last year of college? - Helpful insight and experience wanted,1593811797,"Hello. New to this thread. Not sure if this will be considered a good post to post here but we shall see I guess. I thought I'd post in here to maybe get some helpful suggestions and/or to see what everyone else is experiencing right now. I am currently going into my senior year of my Bachelor's in ChemE at the University of Pittsburgh. 

I'm a little bit of a weird case. After high school I took a year off, and then went to a community college near where my parents lived. Finished my two years, got my electives done, received my associate's degree, and then transferred out to Pitt. I had some weird gaps in my class loads because of this (and also because Pitt uses a pillar system for their ChemE program) and was directed towards trying to get a co-op to help fill these gaps. My plan was to co-op last fall, this summer, and next spring.

I surprisingly found one last minute in Pittsburgh with a process engineering group for manufacturing (more along the lines of industrial engineering but I couldnt complain it was engineering experience and it was in Pittsburgh). I worked with them throughout the fall, through my winter break, and then thankfully enough I was able to continue to work for them as a temp during this past spring semester. That is until COVID hit which then finally lead to me being laid off on April 1 ( I know I asked my manager if it was some sick April Fool's joke). My manager hoped to bring me back later in the summer or in the fall to finish my co-op or to work as a temp again. Well basically long story short the company has been very slow and a lot of employees have been put on long term furlough, so doesnt seem I will be able to go back there even by the fall. It makes me very sad that I lost this position because I absolutely loved my manager, coworkers, and the atmosphere there. I could not complain about one thing. It was an amazing experience especially for my first job in industry and I felt like I was actually making a difference with the projects I worked on. I saw a future there and was so excited that I was working there now as a student because my manager made it clear that he planned for me to become a full-time employee there after I graduated. 

After that I began to apply to new co-op positions to hopefully get one for this summer and finish my last two rotations I still planned to do. I also applied to a few internships as well. As the time went on (almost 60+ applications later) I barely heard back from any places and the ones I have heard from said they're exploring other options. 

The later it got into the summer the more it seemed I wouldn't get a rotation for this summer. This got me thinking. If I continue my rotation program I would end up being pushed back an extra semester or even two. Talking with everyone close to me and looking over my options it seemed like the best thing would be to drop the co-op program, finish up my last two semesters, and graduate May 2021.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else is or has experienced anything like this? I imagine there are many students who have not been able to land new co-ops? Am I making the right decision in not finishing my co-op rotations? Or would it be better to finish my year of experience before I graduate? Should I still at least try for a internship for this fall since my class load is small (less than 12 credits so not even full-time) so that I get the experience I need, and also have a job and make some money during the semester? Has anyone heard of something like that? Or should I just finish my schooling, get a part-time job, and hope to find a full-tine job next summer? Hell my previous co-op employer might even be able to hire me as a full-time employee then too.

My biggest thing is that I really don't want to have to go back and work for less than $12/hour in addition to not working in my field again (like I did before my co-op I worked in retail).

65,"Is it possible to find work in the field and earn the job title of ""engineer"" before completing a bachelor's in the US?",1593791671,"[TL;DR &amp; what I want to do at bottom]

I'm writing to you at 25 (approaching 26) with aspirations to call myself an electrical engineer and the drive to do the work required to get there, but have hit several stumbling points and am looking for guidance that anyone here has to offer.

After working part-time on my education since graduating high school, I finally had the opportunity to attend university full-time last fall. I chose EET at a local (but respected) university with the hopes that I could quickly slap my name on a degree and begin building my work experience. That decision was primarily driven by the hours I had already completed (which were a bit scattered - I was somewhat directionless initially) and my age when I enrolled. However, my current interests primarily revolve around digital electronics, which I know will take at least an MSEE to dive as deep as I'd like to go. At this point in life, though, I feel like I'm ready to get to work, and have decided to put my postgraduate studies off until after I've built more experience and a more thorough understanding of what specialties exist what they entail.

I've been diagnosed with &amp; have begun treating ADHD as an adult, which has been a godsend on my education. It doesn't fix the little things though; like remembering to purchase a plastic block in time for an ""introduction to engineering technology"" class, and since the remaining sessions centered around machining, measuring, and using that block to hold a m/c &amp; speaker, I failed the class.

It doesn't help much with my focus on online classes either, which has been more than a bit of a handicap considering current events. I failed a few classes in which I performed just fine when they were on campus. I attribute the majority of my issues to the disconnected nature of e-learning, which prevented me from investing in the material when we reconvened after spring break. I know that's a personal shortcoming rather than one of e-learning, but it's one that's impacting my ability to achieve my goals regardless. One of those failed classes is the introductory one I mentioned above, and honestly, the thought of taking it a *third* time isn't a happy one. I know what a resistor is, and I've already drawn this damn circuit-board holder in SolidWorks *twice*. Two hours of mandatory attendance per week to do something that I've already done twice before isn't something that appeals to me.

It drives me crazy and makes me question if I'm sure I've picked the right profession, but I've never been so interested in continuing my learning beyond the classroom, so I think I'm at least in the ballpark. I love reading datasheets, looking at circuits, finding nifty components, troubleshooting circuits, etc. I understand and very thoroughly enjoy the math; my major doesn't stress it too much (as it focuses more on implementation versus theory), but I enjoy calculus &amp; make it a point to understand the proofs behind the formulas we use. 

In addition to the looming threat of e-learning again this fall, my past failures have me incredibly discouraged. I think this is what I need to do to get where I want to be, so I'm trying some changes to make it work. I've dropped my enrolled hours to the minimum amount required for full-time status, and I'll be able to handle it just fine. I can do it; it's just that I've been doing it since I was 18, and I'm more motivated than ever to make more than $35k/yr (it's hard to find work that'll work with my schedule and pays something remotely liveable for a mid-20s student).

---

I love learning, but I'm having a hard time making school work for me. It's been a hell of a kick in the motivational glands, but I can't see myself being happy doing anything else. I breath to make things &amp; make them better, and I'm going to keep running my head into this wall as long as it takes, but I wonder if there's another way. Everyone says, ""nobody cares about your degree when you're out of school,"" and I get that because the real learning happens in the field. 

Do you know anyone that holds the job title of ""engineer,"" but doesn't hold a 4-year degree? Is there any apprenticeship-type position that I could get into that would spit out an engineer? Is that at all common? Is it *possible*? I'm not looking to skip steps here, I just feel like I'm trying to put a square peg in a round hole, and I think that the natural instinct of an engineer would be to stop doing that and find the square hole instead.

Of course, I am grateful for all responses &amp; perspectives. I've been holding off on this post because I feel silly for thinking there's some magical alternative avenue into the field that countless others wouldn't have already taken, but I felt sillier for not asking.

---

**[TL;DR]**

I've been in school for too long and don't have much to show for it on paper. I have tons of stuff packed in my head, love learning more all the time, and think I'd make a decent engineer. Still, I'm struggling with getting there due to personal shortcomings that I feel don't reflect my ability to do the work so much as they do my inability to deal with e-learning &amp; rigorous academia. I love the academics, just not the rigidity. 

I want to work in digital electronics, but I imagine that even an introductory role in that field will require a 4-year degree. I know that I know about as close to nothing about electronics as it gets, especially as someone who's only completed 2.75 years of a BS EET, but I like to think I'm pretty good at finding the missing pieces in my understanding and working from there.

I'm not looking for a shortcut - I'd argue that nothing about my academic experience has been ""short"" so far! I recognize that may well be the only way to do what I want to do, though, and I accept that if that's the case. I don't know what I don't know, though, so I'd like to probe the population of engineers here for their perspectives on my situation &amp; to listen to their advice. Thank you for any that you have to offer!

**E** Also, quick clarification, I don't mean to imply I've been failing classes left-and-right since school started. I've performed quite well in all of my classes except the ET principles one last fall and was doing well in all of them in the spring up until e-learning commenced. My struggles aren't with the materials I'm consuming, they're with the manner in which I need to consume them.

However, when I started college I suffered from very low self-esteem and doubted myself to the extent that I forced myself into a major that involved virtually no math.

I’m at a top 5 school right now, on the cusp of completing my bachelor’s degree and I’m realizing I did myself a disservice.

78,Which ECE specialization is better to pursue: Microelectronics or Power Electronics ?,1593783707,"Hi ! I'm an undergraduate student and I have to choose between these two specializations.  
The Microelectronics specialization puts a great stress on learning VLSI desing, manufacturing process, noises in IC, testability,FPGA's, circuit synthesis and VHDL. The Power Electronics gives me the opportunity to learn about microcontrollers, motor control, IoT, sensors and transducers, medical equipment, automotives, basics of computational intelligence and so on.  
I want to get a job in one of these fields but I don't know which one is more required/expanded and which one gives me better career opportunities.(especially in **Eastern Europe**).  
Both seem to be a good choice, but I don't know which one would be more reliable in the ***future*** (taking into account the development of data science; Moore's law, energy resources,etc).  
 I find power electronics a bit more attractive, but it appears to be too easy and something you can learn by yourself, whereas studying microelectronics might become a pain in the neck and be boring/useless unless you get to work for an IC development company. I guess IC design is far more complicated, therefore more appreciated, but I'm not sure if I'll manage to find a job. So, I'm wondering which domain has a better future ?

80,What does the total head in this pump performance chart mean?,1593781841,"Hi! I'm researching about using portable pumps for flood management. I am looking for trash pumps which can handle solids. Upon researching, I found a certain pump with this performance chart.

[https://imgur.com/a/ZfsAJoR](https://imgur.com/a/ZfsAJoR)

I intend to place the pump 7 ft from the fluid surface, and discharge the floodwater without pumping it into a higher level. In my understanding, this means that the total head is 7 ft. The desired flow rate is 300 GPM. However, in this condition, it will fall into the gray region and as per the warning, this may cause damage to the pump.

Upon calculating for the NPSHA, I discovered that in this condition, the pump will not operate within the gray region. 

So what does the total head in this chart really mean? Does it mean the distance between the water surface and the discharge point? Or does it pertain to NPSHA? Thanks!",AskEngineers,False,sinepilipino,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hkiscz/what_does_the_total_head_in_this_pump_performance/

91,Suggestions for alternative materials for the rigid frame of 3D printer!,1593752716,"Hello!

I am building a 3D printer as a part of my BSEE minor project. I had divided it into 3 semesters (as it was 1 credit each sem) in Electronics, Mechanical and finally, Assembly &amp; Troubleshooting parts. 

I bought all the electronic components with equal payment distribution among me and my project mate. But now the frame components are overshooting the prices, so, we applied for financial aid from our department. Our HOD said that they will confirm about the aid.

The costly part is the Aluminium frame parts. But for the worst case, if they don't provide the aid, I can't dump this project as I put much efforts into the electronics part last semester and want to finish this.

So, my question here is:
What other materials can be used, which are comparatively cheap, to make the (rigid) frame of printer?
Any other suggestions are welcome. 

TL,DR: Please give some suggestions for alternative materials (other than Aluminium) for the frame of our printer, as we are on a tight financial aid budget &amp; I can't take out anything more from my pocket.",AskEngineers,False,sierra_mike_niner,/r/AskEngineers/comments/hkd47f/suggestions_for_alternative_materials_for_the/
92,How do I stop a nut from wobbling on a threaded rod?,1593752568,"I'm looking to solve an engineering problem related to one of my DIY projects.

Think of a threaded rod and a nut screwed onto it. The nut has a platform attached to its top face. Whenever you twist the rod, the nut moves up and lifts the platform (or if you twist the platform, it raises itself up on the rod).

The problem is that the nut seems to have some kind of wobble by design and by this I mean that the top face of the nut is not always at a perfect 90° angle relative to the rod.

My project needs to be ultra precise. Is there a certain type of rod or nut that is used for such applications or maybe a different approach entirely? I need to push the platform up from underneath, I can't pull it up from the top side (like with a rope).

Here is a very exaggerated drawing of what I mean by the top face of the nut not always sitting at a perfect angle.

my question is: how do i approach a book that is hard to understand with my level? do i stop at each point till i understand it or do i finish the section and go over what i didnt get? do i stay on same chapter till i finish all exercises even the proof ones (i hate those so much) or do i go over them quickly?

Law school is something that is thrown around a lot and I do intend on taking my LSATs. With that being said, pursuing a JD is an additional 3 years of school with student loans and living costs associated. 

Is there anything else out there? Is it possible to just apply for public policy jobs? Would something like a Masters in Public Policy (MPP) be useful? I saw McMaster has a Masters of Engineering and Public Policy (MEPP).
