0,How Electrical Signal/Memory Works?,1587318077,"So I was wondering with computers or any electronic device in general, how electric signals carry information that can be interpreted and utilized to perform certain actions? So perhaps this conversation has to address some fundamentals, say electricity. For a simple example, say a handheld calculator. How does me pressing the 6 button allow for that to show up as a ""6"" on the screen? Is it a certain electric current from the battery that is ran so that only the ""6"" button can align the magnetic elements in the screen to result in displaying a ""6""? If so, how in the world did they program it like that back when they first made calculators without all of our fancy computers and such today? Say you only had raw materials, battery, some metal wires, etc. In essence, how did they build that calculator and then have it compute equations using raw ""unprocessed"" electricity? If handheld calculators was the simple example, for a harder example, I was wondering about computer memory. How in the world do computers or usb drives ""save"" information that can be manipulated, deleted, changed etc. without an electric current constantly running through the device? Like how does information get ""carried"" across those usb wires to get be ""stored"" in a chip and retained to then be unplugged from a power source to then be plugged in again and then still retain all that information to be able to be accessed and manipulated? I'm just trying to understand how the electrical signals can actually communicate with each other.",AskEngineers,False,Greenleafs91,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g4btm1/how_electrical_signalmemory_works/

2,Chemical Engineering Student Feeling Lost,1587317106,"I'm a chemical engineering student who is completely lost on how I could get to my end goal. I did not know how tough the job market would be for us ChemE's before starting my education, it seems like the recession compounded with low oil prices has seemed to make hiring much more competitive. Add this to the fact that I have no desire to work in a plant far away from anything, and I am feeling really dumb for picking this major. I don't find the coursework bad as I like solving problems, but these problems don't have to be related to my ChemE coursework. I can find most engineering problems interesting. However, transferring between engineering majors at my college is almost impossible due to a large number of students already in these programs. On top of that, my family doesn't have the financial resources for me to pursue further education, I would have to work for a little to pay back my undergraduate degree. As a result, I feel lost. I don't know if I should just bite the bullet and pay my dues for a few years working in an environment I know I will hate, or if I should just transfer out to a local university and try and complete something else.

Sorry if my thoughts aren't coherent or are just outright wrong, this is an issue that's been keeping me up late sometimes. I haven't been able to think or study clearly recently due to my general uneasiness about what I'm doing.

3,"Instead of building the James Webb Telescope to unfold (which seems to have increased the complexity), couldn't they have build a larger space-ship to carry it to orbit?",1587316739,"It seems like all the components to protect the James Webb Telescope from the sun have to still be deployed, but (from what I understand) the biggest problems is the fact that it is composed of 18 hexagonal segments, which all have to have nanometer precision, and also be able to line up absolutely correctly so that the images it captures are clear. If it's off by the smallest amount then the images will be worthless.

This is obviously a huge engineering challenge, so why didn't they (instead) build a larger bay on a shuttle to bring it into orbit so that it doesn't have to be all folded up? Then it could've been one large mirror instead of 18 smaller ones without all the added complexity.

I figure for $8 Billion this would have been much easier to accomplish than it would've been to engineer a large unfolding telescope like this one.

12,Seeking Structural Analysis Report Guidance,1587294611,"Student here looking for some extra direction. For our mid-term in statics with the COVID-19 situation our class was tasked with group projects instead of a traditional exam. In short, were were given a complicated \[for us\] frame problem that involves quite a few frame members and distributed loads within the framework. No two force members, all frames are multi-force members with internal hinges connecting one another. One end of the framework is a fixed support while the other end is a hinge.

Anyway, we finished the analysis last night, balanced out all forces and the moment about the fixed support. Now I wanted to have some fun with the project and instead of just handing in a mess of scratch work with calculations and free body diagrams. I would like to put all this into a report that would mimic that of how a firm would expect a structural analysis of this nature.

Looking for any resources/references to take a peek at online that would give me some extra direction on structuring our results into an engineering report.

Of course as one would imagine, I had the common sense to google things like ""engineering analysis report"" which yielded photos and some articles on reports.

**Figure.** [https://imgur.com/cuuTy1K](https://imgur.com/cuuTy1K)

I'll place three of the questions that could help answer. This is by the way a question made by our professor himself and according to him barely anyone got the answers to this question. This question has also around 13 questions and I'm just providing three here.

**Questions.**

1. Find the Gauge pressure inside the tank, and also
2. The corresponding absolute pressure; assume that water level initially is at a column height of 32.815 feet.
3. Find the pressure difference inside the tank in absolute if the supply line adds 150 cubic meter of water.

**My personal Attempts:**

1. I know the Gauge Pressure formula for being ***Pg=mg/A***. I do also know it can be derived to ***Pg= density x gravity x height.*** Now this is my attempt answering Pressure gauge. Given that Liquid Density is water is *997kg/ m**^(3)*. Gravity is *9.81 m/ s**^(2)*. And height of the liquid in the tank is 32.815ft converted to 10.002m.     **Pg =** ***997 kg/m******^(3)*** ***x 9.81 m/s******^(2)*** ***x 10.002 m = 97825.26 Pa or 97.825 KPa***
2. My attempt on absolute pressure. **Pt = Pg + Patm** (atmospheric pressure). **Pt = 97.825 KPa +  101.3 KPa** (earth atmospheric pressure) **= 199.125 KPa.** I'm not entirely sure here because I used earth atmospheric pressure than the air left above the tank. I'm sure I'm not right but an explanation as to why I'm not would help me greatly.
3. I haven't tried to answer this, just want to make sure that this question states it added in **150 cubic meter** of water into the tank that is already filled with 10.002m of water. Converting 150m^(3) to meters it is 5.3133m, so the tank is now 15.3153 m filled. But isn't that .3153 extra from the figure? Tell me what I did wrong.

I know posting a question without attempts to answer is a butthole move so I tried and hopes anyone can explain to me what I did wrong or missed. Thank you! Keep safe out there.",AskEngineers,False,MatchaTealicious,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g4139h/find_the_gauge_pressure_inside_the_tank/

In addition, I'm pretty burned out at my current job (have been with the same employer for the bulk of my career).  


Looking for job opportunities in the geographic area, the pickings are slim.  There are plentiful mechanical engineering jobs for HVAC however.  I last took thermodynamics and heat transfer back in 2005 in college, never a formal HVAC course.  I have a bachelor's in mechanical, a masters in industrial.

I am not sure if it is worth it. I have too few decision that I didn't regret afterwards. I am sure I hate medicine but I have already lost 3 years here and staying here to complete degree is much more easier than switching to engineering. I don't need to do anything extra to find job as a doctor, I just have to pass classes.

I want to measure the maximum acceleration of an object that is thrown (gently - more like tossing a ball to a small child, less like a professional baseball pitch). Wires are a no-go, so I'm looking at stand-alone mechanical options. I was thinking something like one of those force dial indicators, where as the main needle spins up it moves a second needle with it, and when the force drops and the main needle spins down the second needle stays still marking the max force.  Only linear - so like an airplane slip indicator or one of those linear force meters you can use to weigh your luggage, but with that second marker to show the max position reached.

Let's pretend the landing is a non-issue for now. Does something like this exist? Or do you have other ideas on how to measure the max acceleration?",AskEngineers,False,KiwiHopeful,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g3uu0b/how_to_measure_accelerations_using_an_onboard/

I am a recent graduate of the Civil Engineering Technology Program in Canada. It's the equivalent of an associate's in engineering technology in the US. As much as I have found my job in the civil industry to be rewarding and challenging, I feel my passion lies elsewhere.

I want to be able to work in engineering sectors other than civil/construction. Preferably in automotive or aerospace design/manufacturing/service industry. I feel that a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering could give me an entrance to such engineering jobs. However, I am not sure if getting a degree in mechanical engineering is an absolute to get into these industries. I will need at least 3 more years to get the mechanical engineering degree, whereas, a civil engineering degree would only take 2 more years. I am certainly ready to put in the time if I need to. I am also considering master’s in mechanical but not sure what schools would let a civil engineering graduate into a master’s of mechanical engineering.

I am hoping someone who is working in automotive or aerospace industry can help me with this. Would hiring managers in automotive or aerospace engineering firms (especially in Canada but the US as well) consider hiring someone with a civil engineering degree? I feel I would need more on-the-job training than someone coming from a mechanical or aerospace engineering background.

I think I would be able to solve this linkage if the bodies moved in unison throughout their arc of movement, ie each body reaches the extreme extent of its arc at the same time, however I've complicated it by 'offsetting' the motion of each body relative to the previous one. Meaning that when Body 01 is at the extreme extent of its arc then Body 02 is still heading towards the extreme extent of its own arc. 

I've been wracking my brain to try and solve this and haven't got anywhere really. The closest I've got was to use a wheel, either as shown in the diagram or by a treadle. For example, an arm could extend out from the fixed point shown on the diagram to drive a wheel attached to the center of Body 01, thereby translating the oscillating motion into rotational. If an arm extended from Body 02 to this wheel it could then translate the rotation of the wheel back into oscillating motion to drive Body 02. The location of the fixing point of the arm on the wheel would determine how 'offset' the movement of Body 02 is relative to Body 01. Does that make sense? 

The problem I have with that idea though is that I'm not convinced that I can properly translate the oscillating motion into rotational, particularly if the system is going super slow which means that the wheel wouldn't have any inertia and might just get stuck at the extreme extent of the arc. Also I feel like it's inefficient translating the oscillating motion to rotational and back again. I've no doubt there are many far better ways to achieve this!

On the other hand I have the commercial unit that is below me that appears to have a single metal ceiling and then what I am standing on is a linoleum floor. I Fear that there is no insulation at all other than those two materials.

They also quote rediculous times for making option kits to send to customers which usually consists of some sheet metal parts and a bag of hardware in a cardboard box.

Well, I'll try to explain it clearly:

1) I workout in my house

2) I'm thinking of a contraption that pulls a cable similar to a pulley machine cable

3) The cable would go through a pulley system, attached to another cable, that is actually pulled by  pulling contraption.

4) That contraption would be attached to the ground (probably, if easier) and would pull that cable with a force that I could ***select*** and change ***dynamically***

5) The force do not need to be that high (e.g. a thousand newtons, at max) and the actual length pulled could be some 50 cm at max

6) I'm thinking of something with I could freely change the force of pulling, for example, with the smartphone via Bluetooth (Yes, I don't have a clue of how complex this implementation would be)

 **As illustration:** I would be holding a ""curl bar"" attached by the cable that goes through the pulley system (attached at the end to the pulling contraption) in a standing position, with my arms bent to a 90 degrees. I would select a ""strength of pulling"" in my smartphone (don't need to be that, I just need a system that can measure and select an *exact* force), and the contraption would slowly (some seconds) reach that force and stay there, trying to pull the cable that I'm holding through the curl bar.

As you see, I want to make a ""negative"" exercises with a cable-pulling machine in which I can select exact and changeable strengths of pulling.

I am ignorant of the limits and practicality of this idea, so please forgive me if this  is impractical or sound dumb (I have no clue).

https://youtu.be/ylqWvJOGWjU

Imgur Link contains pictures and description of 3 different dies. 

YouTube link is for general rivet maker mechanics.

This is a rivet making die. The part in the pics receives the body of the rivet while a matrix cold forges the head in 1 blow. 

So this client of mine is having the problem that his dies are failing in less than 50 hours of operation. Originally, dies were made like sample 3, and they began failing. I suggested reducing hardness slightly to increase resistance to shock in the same tool steel, H13. It worked marginally, increasing to 50-60 hours of operation from 30, but it’s still low. 

The client wants us to offer them an alternative material to use, to which we offered S7 tool steel, before they tested samples 1 and 2. 

Now, seeing the damage of lesser hardness dies, it looks like the matrix is maybe pressing too much material on the die, making it fail there because of the stress concentration at the edge of the die, and I’m beginning to think it’s not a problem of the material directly, but of the amount of wire it’s trying to press.

The question is, am I making the correct assumption, considering that I don’t have access to the machine to check?",AskEngineers,False,KnownSoldier04,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g36o1r/need_help_diagnosing_a_problem_in_a_river_making/

29,"Why does the toilet sometimes flush after one pull, and other times after 10?",1587132409,"In my rented place there is an old toilet with a water reservoir close to the ceiling (model: Sphinx royal kiwa). From underneath is a pipe of about 1.5m long down to the toiletpot. On one side of the water reservoir there is a handle to pull for a flush. So far I've come to the conclusion that I need to pull it calmly and slowly so the water gets flowing. If I release to soon, the water didn't start to flow and there would be no flush. 

Inconsisteny is that sometimes I barely touch the handle, and the toilet flushes unexpectedly quick, other times I need to pull several times before it starts flushing. I've searched the internet how to adjust it to 1 easy pull, but I can't for the life of me find any information (maybe because the system is older then the internet?).

Obviously I want to be a commercial pilot but the little job security due to the volatile industry and the hugeeeee financial requirement for training has put me off in the realistic sense, sinfe I come from quite a poor background anyway.

So I like maths and physics to an extent, especially mechanics. I like doing the classwork but Im not someone who drools for challenging questions or o attends those extra maths things aimed at gifted students.

40,Spider Gears in Differentials,1587118314,"I was discussing with a friend today the effect of removing spider Gears out of a differential as an alternative to welding a differential for drift purposes. Instead of having a hypothetical conversation and a bunch of what ifs, I turn to my engineering background to try and see if this is a viable theory. 

My understanding of differentials is generally good. But I want to make sure I am thinking about this the right way. To make it easuer, I'll focus on the case of a normally set up limited slip differential with 4 spider gears within the inner casing that rotates with the ring gear. When driving straight, all these spider gears and it's case do is rotate, no spin occuring about their individual axis. When you turn, they distribute some of the load to help even out power delivery between inner/outer wheels. 

So, by removing 2 of the spider gears in parallel, the 4 are no longer connected. Since the casing is still connected, it will spin both axles with the ring gear. Is this a viable alternative to ruining a differential by welding it? I know that spider gears support some of the inner weight, but would they change in force be significant enough to make an impact on the rest of the system? I assume more of it will shift toward seals, so would providing heavier duty seals be all that would be needed for that change? And how negatively would that impact potential life cycles? And would it even work; would the differential act in a more open sense, providing the results closer to what we might be looking for?

42,Life as a Project Engineer/Manager?,1587116673,"Hi all.

So I'm currently studying Civil Engineering at University and interested in the path to become a project manager/construction manager. Whilst I am decent at both Maths and Physics, I don't envision myself always doing technical aspects of Engineering in the future; that just doesn't excite me and whilst I am solving questions monotonously (and sometimes with difficulty) at Uni, I'm not necessarily having fun solving questions such as ""calculate the stress on a beam"". I'm more interested in the bigger picture. I've heard that project managers in the construction sector tend to have Engineering backgrounds but usually deal with stakeholders and essentially ""manage"" the whole project without working so much on the technical aspects. That interests me more. I've also had an interest in finance and I've heard PM's usually need to be good in terms of finance.

So, are there any project engineers/managers here who can explain their day to day life (i.e. what do you do at work in terms of technical and other abilities) and overall lifestyle (e.g. work-life balance)? How did you make it in the fieldd, how did you climb the ladder and are there any advices you could give to graduate civil engineers?

So I'm currently working on my thesis which largely consists of reliability engineering. Currently my task is to estimate lambda and beta values from the Crow-AMSAA and general repair process (Kijima) and estimate the corresponding fits.

However, it is possible to convert the lambda to an eta(eta=1/lambda\^beta), which is nice so I can compare it to my time for first-failure weibull fit. I have done so, but the resulting eta is in 6/8 cases way(way...) off (actually like 1000 times smaller). The 2 cases that fit(same formula) are actually pretty close.

47,How to calculate suspension requirements for dog wheelchair,1587112489,"**Background:**

My dog's rear legs are paralyzed and she gets around in a wheelchair. However, she is very active and so I want to add some suspension that will both:

a) provide general stability to increase ride comfort and reduce drag and

b) provide shock dampening for larger, less frequent impacts (ie. hitting a street curb front-on while running).

My research so far has me looking at a small, custom made 'wheel strut'. By this I mean a straight gas shock dampener surrounded by a suspension spring, which also serves to attach the wheel itself to the chassis. So I don't want the anchor points to rotate and I need the wheel strut to resist lateral movement and only slide up-and-down.

Load Weights = about 10-15kg

Top Speed = 25km/h

Average Speed = 7-10 km/h

**Questions:**

a) How do I calculate the specifications required of the gas dampener and suspension spring?

b) Is there some other type of suspension setup that would be more appropriate?

59,Advice On Torque Required For Counterweight Spring,1587096043,"Hey guys,

My brother has a repurposed truck curtain covering his firewood which is wrapped around a top roller with motor off an old conveyor system (pretty much like a motorised blind). The motor hasn't worked for a while. At the moment he's got a rope to release the motor brake and another to operate the blind on a Jury rigged pulley.
What we're wanting to do is put a pulley at the end of the other shaft with a rope to an old horse trailer spring so that when the brake rope is pulled, the blind automatically lifts up off the spring tension.
I've found formulas for moments of inertia etc. but I'm not sure what else I need to know.

Specs:
Truck curtain weight = 22kg
Truck curtain width = 2200mm
Drum diameter = 76.1mm
Pulley diameter = 120mm
The shafts coming out of either end of the drum are either 25mm or 1"" if that needs to be factored in?

Any help with formulas and breakdowns of how they're used would be much appreciated and give us something to work on during the current lockdown.

The bottom of the treehouse is 7.5 feet off the ground, which should make it quite easy to attach. As far as the design goes, each sheet of plywood is 8'x4'x3/4'' except for the top one which is only 8'x2'. Most of the wood consists of 2x4s, mostly 8' long. The two front posts are 15' long 4x4s that are going to go 1.5 feet into the ground(with concrete) and the plan is for these two posts to hold up the majority of the weight of the whole wall. The angled section is 30 degrees

I believe this design should hold. the only part I really am not sure about how well the bottom of the angled portion will be connected to the rest of the wall. I plan on using #14x3 1/2 screws for most of the connecting, except for attaching the plywood to the 2x4s, which I plan on using #10x 2 1/2s.

I am looking for any design tips or even tips for building it. My current plan is to build it all on the ground and then lift it up and attach it to the buried posts. Thank you for any help!

Why do you think there is a low retention of women in engineering, especially upon graduating? How do you think the industry can retain more women?

13,Should I leave my job at a small company I enjoy working for to go to a huge and highly regarded defense contractor?,1587047115,"So I am one year out of college now with a systems engineering degree. My first job was absolutely terrible, so I started applying to other jobs fairly early on. I disliked it there because it was incredibly boring, we were micromanaged to an insane level, there was absolutely no room for advancement or learning new skills, and the company culture was awful. 

I have been at my second job for a few weeks now and I enjoy it for the most part. It is with a very small ERP/ engineering consulting firm which helps companies utilize a certain ERP (its one of the smaller market shares) to optimize their businesses. The work itself is okay (I just dislike the pressure of always trying to be billable), however I truly love the company culture, and I really like all my coworkers and the work life balance here. My only worry is that because so much of the job is focused on this one ERP software, I won't be gaining a ton of transferable skills and I also worry about the security of the company do it's size. I would definitely feel terrible for leaving so soon, but I have to look out for myself.

A few days ago I received a good offer for a manufacturing engineering position from a huge and prestigious defense contractor (rhymes with morthrop shmumman), I applied to this position before I applied to my current position. I would have to move to the middle of nowhere which would suck and I really love the city I'm currently in, but I know that this company would look amazing on my resume, and that they have ample resources for training their employees (especially engineers) and that there is great potential for advancement and career growth. 

Both jobs pay around the same (although I imagine the larger one may pay more in the long term), and have comparable benefits packages. Here is some info about me: I am ambitious and want to grow as a professional, but I also just want to be able to put in 40 good hours a week and then enjoy life outside of work. I am probably less technically inclined and passionate about engineering than the average engineer (although people seem to think I am intelligent), but I think that I am better socially than the average engineer (I interview well and I enjoy working with people).

I will admit I don't exactly have a habit of pushing flashy sports cars to the limit in real life, but I do it quite frequently while playing video games. 

So what is actually happening when you reach ""top speed"" and what is preventing you from going even faster? 

It seems like when you are driving flat out in top gear, the car will hit it's maximum speed and then it will roll back a few mph before returning to it's maximum speed and then rolling back a few mph again and again. 

Would this happen in real life or would the engine just explode? If this does happen in real life why? Assuming there is still fuel to burn why can't you continue going faster? Is the car reaching the mechanical limitations of the engine?

36,What's a DIY fix for my washed out road (in rural Alaska)?,1587013032,"Looking for advice for a DIY road fix.

I live in rural Interior Alaska and last summer, unprecedented rain and flooding washed out a chunk of the road to my property. Essentially the hole is 40 x 42ft and 5ft deep. We had a 3ft culvert a few feet downstream of the washout, but the flooding was so intense that it overtook the culvert and started eroding the road right before it. What is usually a dry creek bed became a raging river, with most of the water coming from the adjacent meadow and a portion flowing parallel to the road before overtaking it. My neighbors and I have never seen it quite like this before and expect to be able to chalk it up to an unusual event, but hope to come up with a fix that will better withstand future scenarios.

Though this is technically a public road, our borough doesn’t have much as far as funds for road repairs, especially with COVID-19 largely affecting the economy around here. My neighbors and I are on our own and are trying to decide what our best option is. We’re looking for something that is a balance between durable and economical. As far as equipment, we have a John Deere 310SG Backhoe, Bobcat S220, Wacker 5hp plate compacter, Dodge 3500 flatbed truck, and a 24’ goose neck trailer. We’re remote but on the road system so do have access to some materials such as culverts, gravel, and concrete.

Two options we’ve considered:

1. Installing two adjacent 4ft culverts in line with the streamflow and filling it back up to grade with gravel.
2. Creating a low water crossing with a few smaller, 2 or 3ft culverts and cementing in place.

Any thoughts or advice is appreciated. Temperatures are finally warming up and melt means that the temporary road we installed for winter will likely degrade, so hoping to fix this soon. Let me know if you want more information. Thank you for your time.

I didn't know how much field work was expected of me while I was in school because it was never brought up during class. When I started to apply to jobs, they all either required that I live in the country (with no public transit) or make frequent trips to field sites and manufacturing facilities. I couldn't apply to any of these jobs because I can't drive, and I ultimately took a position in education. 

I miss engineering. I want to go back, and maybe even consider going to grad school. So my questions are:

1. Did I choose the wrong discipline? Are there other engineering disciplines I should have gone into to avoid field work?

2. Will grad school help? Say I went all the way through and got a PhD; would the increased likelihood of being relegated to research help reduce the need for field work on my part?

3. Should I give up on engineering? Will there always be field work to the extent that I should move on to something else?

60,Power engineering - Voltage compensation in a distribution system with DG,1586969200,"Hello,  I'm trying to complete my honours project at the moment and I'm really struggling with it.  As the title says I'm studying voltage control techniques in a network with DG (distributed generation).  I've created and ran the network through simulation software and have identified overvoltage violations.  Before this I've studied voltage control techniques such as using OLTC, power curtailment, volt/var compensation etc.  I have been able to simulate some of these techniques and get the network to run without any voltage level violations, however, I have done this by trial and error running the simulation.  

Where I am really struggling is how to apply technical equations and theory of voltage control techniques to the network before running the simulation or even to relate the theory to enable me to back up my successful simulation results.  

I'll try to give a couple of examples to clarify what I mean.  

I know I need to increase the hosting capacity and I can see the hosting capacity through the simulation in terms of the voltage level but I can't calculate what it is though the data I have.

One of the voltage control methods is power curtailment, I can say that if the power generated by the DG (in my study it is 2 0.9 MW wind turbines) is halved from 1.8MW to 0.9MW then the network will not not encounter any violations of statutory voltage limits, however, I can't calculate the 0.9MW generation.  I only know it because of trial and error through the simulation.  

So I guess I'm asking a couple of things here.  Will an honours project pass if it has limited technical detail in it?  Does anyone have any tips to relate theory to real data? I have scoured IEEE and all of the algorythms and are very advanced, cutting edge or are way past my knowledge level to understand.

We noticed a couple ‘open  source’ design concepts that were posted online. As a company focused  on motion control solutions, we wanted to explore additional ways to  mechanically actuate an ‘Ambu Bag’.

We  put our engineering, sales and operations team in motion, and had some  ideas for new designs that would offer some advantages versus a simple  motor and camming design or a pneumatic cylinder. Within one week we  have created two concept designs that use screw driven linear actuators.

*These  proposed technologies are the first step in creating new and reliable  ventilators for patients around the world. Tolomatics’ hope is to spark  interest and conversation with other potential partners in developing a  final solution that can be submitted for approval.*

Both of our prototypes are screw driven linear actuators that convert rotary power from a  servo motor into linear motion. This device now can control the  velocity, the acceleration and the distance of any move at any point in  time. Our mechanical device requires a servo motor, drive and some sort  of control program. There would also need to be a user interface that  could be done by knobs and switches, an HMI screen or a lap top  computer.

The beam will extend past the brackets, to allow for an additional swing, which leads to my question of how to brace that piece of the beam.

I plan to use a 16' beam which will result in approx 78"" extending past the bracket. The legs extend 24"" past the brackets which leaves 54"" of clearance for the swing. With the attached picture as an example, what is the best/safest method to brace that beam extension? Would carriage bolts be preferred vs lag screws?

79,[Discussion] Would you use mortar as render in your project? [Read-not typical],1586949544,"**EDIT1:** **~~Render~~** **Plaster** 

I made a post before about mortar with lightweight aggregates and phase change materials. With corona etc going on, labs got shut down so I cannot get lab data to support this theory. So here's the direction my project is heading: making a ~~render~~ plaster inside of buildings that can store heat energy.

Info: Phase change materials (PCM) that are shelled and look like lightweight aggregates are added to cement, sand and water, along with polystyrene beads (or any other LWA to make it light). The PCM absorbs thermal energy to change phase (so the temperature remains the same). That energy absorbed is a lot cause it is latent energy and therefore, reduces the heating/cooling you will need. It also reduces fluctuations in temperature (thermal comfort) and can delay the time when heating/cooling is required (smaller durations)

The PCM I am using is as expensive as sand and works at a temperature suitable for both summer and winter (well two pcms).

Benefits: much better thermal conductivity than normal mortar - 50% at the proportions I'm using. '166% more thermal energy storage than normal mortar'

What are the problems/challenges I am overlooking?

The compressive strength of the ~~render~~ plaster according to British Standards (I need to confirm this) is minimum like 3MPa and currently, the sample with 55% sand (45% PCM and polystyrene) should have a strength of 10MPa+. So strength should not be an issue - It won't be used for structural purposes

Some previous research looked into it and the payback time for one of them was around 30 years. Another research concluded a 24% reduction in annual electricity cost. It is obvious that those two numbers are very different but we will be conservative and consider the 30 years one as the realistic outcome. (it may be closer to 15 years)

Of course, there are bigger factors like you lose more heat through a window. Finding a solution to that would greatly reduce the 30 years payback time.

Personally, polystyrene was quite horrible to work with. My samples had a lot of holes because the surface polystyrene would just break out. It can be swapped for another lightweight aggregate or no lightweight aggregate at all if needed.

The ~~render~~ plaster does not change air content. So additional mechanical ventilation is not required just because of the ~~render~~ plaster.

TLDR: Would you use a ~~render~~ plaster that would decrease heating/cooling required and have a payback time of 30 years? If not, why so? On the long term, you could describe it as 'sustainable'. Well this is arguable.

82,How to enter the defense industry?,1586944358,"First of all I'll say if you want the actual question and not the rant/venting of personal concerns skip these first two paragraphs.

With Coronavirus slowing hiring for the Automotive industry to a standstill I've become pretty worried about job security, I live in Michigan, go to school in Detroit so I always assumed when I'd graduate I'd enter a field that I'm passionate about(specifically Powertrain engineering) , but it's become clear to me it's an extremely volotile industry and having a job at all is more important to pursuing my interests and passions than waiting for a job to arrive that people way more qualified than me will probably be jumping on. 

The only thing I can think of is defense. Government contracts and the need for weapons to counteract foreign development doesn't stop

Now that I've for some reason vented my thoughts and frustration out to people who can probably understand, the main question is, How do I get in? What kind of classes should I be taking at the very end of my degree?(1-2 semesters left) Should I be afraid of telling the truth that I used smoke weed in Highschool (referring to security clearance, I had a MI issued Medical marijuana card in HS that's why I'm especially worried)?

83,are cheap aquarium chillers able to made tank water really cold?,1586943355," Hi,

There   are plenty of aquarium chillers on aliexpress  which are in the range  of  $60 to $150. many of them come with a water-pump and pipes, so the   entire set. They claim they can adjust the water in the range of 5c to   38c, but I'm skeptical.

My tank is 45L, and the temperature is around 36c. I want to make it as cold as possible.

Do   you think these will help? what is the realistic temperature  result  if  I use one of these chillers? What if I use two of them at the same   tank?

This is where I run into trouble, how do I future proof myself if I don't know where to go?

&amp;#x200B;

Some background, in case it helps:

 I've been a programmer analyst working in the data science/data engineering space for two years. I have an undergraduate degree in math and a graduate degree in data science. I like programming and my job is fulfilling and challenging at times but I've realized getting out of the office is important to me (enough that I'm considering making a move to ensure it is part of my work life). 

Previously, I wrenched on my frankenstein of a car as a teenager and, more recently, I mess around with basic electronics. Also worked in civil construction running a shovel and doing some basic QC stuff between undergrad and grad school. My impression is that I'd enjoy electronic engineering or mechanical engineering but, having never taken classes or worked in either, I could misunderstand what they entail. 

One route I've looked at is pursuing an electronics engineering technology program (two years). It offers lots of hands on training and also permits bridging to a full four year program if I'm really into it. The jobs that motivated my considering of this program were all titled something like: 'Control/Automation Systems Engineer/Technician'.

I'm open to any potential careers (and routes leading to them!) that include the opportunity to both hack away at the computer and actually build/fix something with my hands.

Inside Newton's equation for impact depth it says it only applies to a blunt impactor at high velocities for materials without fibers (cohesion). This is because at higher forces solids act as a fluid. Though it's possible sticking with just base forces is better than this detail for the game.

__my questions thus far___
Sharpness is the radius of the edge, honing aligns the edge. How does the angle of an edge change this? How does the radius of an edge change this?

How do I handle lower velocities knowing that the upper limit for the speed of a punch is 45mph ~ 20m/s (truncated values here thereafter), a boxing athletes punch is 11m/s, and an average punch is 9m/s? What equations are out there, what material properties do I look for?

My situation: I have a project manager and a team that’s comprised of me, and two other engineers, A and B, who have been there for about 4 years each. Here’s where it gets weird. I don’t really interact with my PM. All projects go to one of the two other engineers, and I work “under” one of them, A, who mind you is not licensed (nor EIT) but is pretty good at his job. It’s clear he’s being pushed into a management position by our PM. I thought it was because I was new and he was a mentor, and didn’t really think much of it. Fast forward to today, and I’m still doing his menial tasks. I still do normal engineering work (maybe a 30 engineering/70 other stuff split?) but most of my work is updating title blocks, running sheet sets of plans, drafting in a flood line here and there, small redlines. It’s menial and demeaning. I noticed that he seems to think he’s my boss although we both have the same title (and I have my EIT). I feel like his secretary. He’s generally bossy and it doesn’t take a genius to see that he enjoys this. I haven’t brought it up to my PM because well, he sort of set this workflow up. Why am I not getting assigned projects or at least a bigger part of the team projects? I feel I can hold my own with maybe a smaller project with guidance from my team and PM. Instead, my PM leaves it to Engineer A to delegate my work. And he’s not good at it. I’ll get tasks that I have no context for and it’s because I’m not included in emails that lead up to that task. I have no part in any decisions or even sit in on any meetings he has with our PM. it’s always “I will discuss with PM and we’ll go from there” Few days later another menial task, scraps from their conversation days prior I assume from the work that’s already been done in the file.

21,Applied sciences vs technical,1586892862,"Hey everyone. So I’m a first year university student in a brand new german applied sciences university that opened in my homecountry. 

TLDR found at the end 

There was always this very popular academically “ strong” also german university in my country too. This has accumulated a strong reputation in my country for its rigorous study system especially for engineers. 

I find myself in this dilemma where I am not sure if I should stay in this new university as it’s first ever batch, or just move to that well known Uni.

For context, I want to leave my country ( third world), and I think the easiest way would be to do my masters in Germany.

So at this point, I know that both unis don’t amount to anything outside my home country. Now I’m looking at other aspects.

1) Education. 
The well known old university has a good system with really good professors and it’s very hard. They take maths for at least 2 years etc. Their majors are more broad so they cover more ideas rather than specific. 
The uni I’m in right now is more specialized, more hands on and practical. I find it baffling that we don’t take further mathematics past the second semester. ( but i might be wrong) It’s branding is that it’s applied sciences and we take more lab instead. I know the craze about more specialized engineering majors since the market is super saturated already with engineers with general degrees, my brother being one of them ( civil) 

2) Connections.
The well known Uni has ofcourse established a lot of good connections and the social networking life there would blossom, as I have been attending my year in their campus ( basically the new uni’s campus is yet to be built so we are attending at that old known uni’s campus for the time being) and I have made a lot of connections with good people. The professors and TAs we have are mostly if not all their staff.  Many clubs already well established and provide good opportunities.
Uni is about social Networking Right?

The new university will require a lot of work, barely any connections, but the president has taken interest and is backing it as to improve the economy and the tourism and all that bullshit. So accordingly we should be getting a lot of support. “ The attention will be on us as a new university and a first batch”.

3) Job Opportunities.
Evryone has told me if you wanna stay here, go for that old known university, but if you wanna leave, the new one might be more of help as it’s new, specialized and is considered purely german. 
Also they said that we would have a much higher chance of being hired as staff members in the university which is good for us.

At this point I’m so lost. I can’t even compare their syllabuses well because the new Uni only had the name of the credit hours. For more details if you’d like to help I can PM you the university links. I don’t want to seem like a hassle but this has ordeal has been going back and forth in my mind. To add to all that, since this COVID-19 has been shitting on economies, some have told me it’s be wise to opt for that old Uni as Germany and the other uni’s there that are collaborating to work on making this new Uni would be too busy dealing with the aftermath of this, so we would be at an even greater disadvantage. I’m trying to summarize as much as possible but there are more details if yoh think these aren’t good enough to judge. 

Or does it really not matter? Do I just work on myself and make the best of what I’ve got? 

Transferring will be annoying as in the second semester we took some different courses and I might have to take them in summer and deal with their advanced courses the year after without having taken the ones before. I’m even contemplating redoing the year since I’m a freshman and this second semester has gone down the drain. 

Doesn’t help that Ever since the quarantine started I stopped completely studying, feeling so demotivated, and now this whole thing is just adding more stress. I admit to slacking off though. 

List of engineering majors : 
In the new Uni: robotics and automation, auto motivate mechatronics, manufacturing engineering, automation and control engineering, electrical power systems engineering.

In the old one: Materials engineering. 
Media and engineering technology ( basically computer science, more general and you get to be called an engineer. 
Information engineering and technology( networks and communication ) 
Design and production engineering
Mechatronics engineering 
Arch and civil ( I don’t wanna go to them tbh)

As to what I want todo, I am still unsure. I am contemplating everything. That’s a whole other dilemma lmao. 

Also the new Uni I’m in has a whole CS faculty with its own specialization.

Oh also the social life in the new Uni is shit, barely 500 students across the entire Uni and everyone their is just... nah

30,Pizza Steel or Pizza Aluminium?,1586885373,"I suppose the alternate title of this post is: What is the heat capacity of a pizza?

I've used a pizza stone a few times but was never satisfied with the pizza/bread it made. Additionally, after making one pizza you have to wait quite a while for it to reheat back up to temperature.

I'm now looking at buying a slab of metal to use instead. I know its possible to but pizza steels, but what about using aluminium?

The volumetric heat capacity of steel is 3.7 J/Kcm^3, while aluminium is lower at 2.4. On the other hand, the thermal conducivity of steel is around 50 W/mK while alu is 4 times higher somewhere around 200. 

Obviously aluminium is more expensive, but looking at what is available to me now, I can get a 350mm sqare slab either 8mm thick in steel or 6mm thick in alu for the same price. 

The alu will obviously store less heat, but should re-heat faster. And this kind of leads me on to the question in the alternate title: Will the alu plate have enough thermal mass to heat the pizza to temp or will the pizza sink too much heat away?

34,When a feature of size is being referenced as a datum at MMB why does orientation take precedence finding the virtual condition?,1586884243,"https://i.imgur.com/2VEIHpn.png
 
So lets say I have this hole being referenced as a datum MMB. So from what I understand finding the shift tolerance (or the size gage to insert into the part) and inspecting other features referencing this datum at MMB I would find the virtual condition from the perpendicularity (orientation). 
 
So there are two virtual conditions

1.  .505 - .020 = .485
2.  .505 - .005 = .500
 
I would use the second virtual condition to size a gage for the inspection, or for the shift tolerance. If there was no perpendicularity or orientation feature control frame, we would use the first virtual condition .485.
 
My question is:

1. Why do we use the second virtual condition? Mentally I can't actually visualize physically why we use the second virtual condition.
 
2. What is the actual mating envelope of the hole? Is it MMC - position tol - orientation tol ?

I see so many consumer-grade products on the market advertised as UV-C that don't publish any data to back up their claim.

I was thinking it might be fun to test some of the lamps in several of these products to see:

1. Are they really UV-C?
2. What is the Intensity vs Wavelength distribution of each lamp?
3. What   is the germicidal efficiency of the lamp? Some manufacturers will list  a  total radiant lamp power, but not how much of that power falls  within  the certain germicidal wavelength band.
4. I'm  also interested in seeing the solarization rate of these bulbs to   understand how they compare to the product life recommended by the  manufacturer.

Looking through resources online, I am getting a bit lost and overwhelmed by some of the detail.

It   sounds like I will generally need some type of spectroradiometer, though I am not sure which one would be best for my application. The   bulbs in most of the products I was thinking of looking at are around   20mm to 150mm in length.

88,Polymerization reactor - top entering agitator double seal failures,1586807023,"Hello! This is a combination mechanical/chemical question but here it goes.

One of my colleagues is seeing mechanical seal failures at the agitator constantly. Like multiple failures on the same agitator in a single year. Her process is an aqueous based polymerization process with a film forming final product. Some of the products tend to foam. The reaction starts under vacuum and slowly pressurizes as the reaction proceeds (usually about 5 psi, max up to 25 psi) with temperatures usually at 140-190 deg F. 

Key points;

* The process fluid starts leaking out of the seal assembly when it fails.
* The failures have occurred at any point; whether vacuum or pressured up, beginning of reaction and end of reaction.
* It has occurred on multiple reactors of varying configuration and size.
* It has occurred over several grades of product; some particularly foamy, some not foamy at all. With that said, products are flip flopped in the same reactors.

I don't have details on their root cause analysis of the failures to see if they investigated which components in the seal failed. Their maintenance team says that it is because the foam is pushing into the internal seal (internal seal is dry since it is a top entering agitator) and drying creating friction on the seal faces. She did however tell me that their seal pots are oriented awkwardly where they charge them with glycol and then pressurize with nitrogen and then close off a valve to seal the pressure. The pressure isn't regulated with a backpressure regulated feed. There is no cooling to the seal pots. Unfortunately there is no instrumentation to read the seal pot pressure and temperature outside of local gauges.

Maintenace's theory makes sense but there should be some flow from the seal pot that keeps the internal dry faces lubricated under the process pressure. My thought is that because there is no continuous source of pressure on the seal fluid that it inevitably leaks. Once the pressure drops down enough, the process pressure overtakes the seal pressure and process fluid flows into the seal.

My recommendation to her is going to be; put a pressure indicator on the seal pot that goes back to the DCS to predict failures, put cooling water to the seal pots to eliminate heat variables, install redundant regulators that feed constant pressure to the seal pot(s), and if possible convert the more robust double cartridge seals for dry running or to contacting sliding seals. But before all that, she should probably get a vendor out to audit their installations because they don't seem correct.

First time poster, and brand new student studying engineering at the open university. Big thanks to this community for all the great posts!

One of the topics we're covering right now is strain. 

I'm trying to understand if strain applied only to extension of an object's length, or if it includes things like bending i.e. deformation. For example, what would be the term to measure the bend in a plant's stem when there is a breeze? 

At first I thought this would be strain, but now I'm thinking maybe not. Unfortunately, I've tried looking up definitions of engineering strain but different sites offer different definitions.

If it is the case that strain is only a measure of deformation in relation to length, then is there a term to describe measure of deformation that take further dimensions into consideration, such as in the example of the plant stem?

Also - how would you calculate the strain on the plants stem? I was curious, below are my workings. However, I have no idea if this would be the correct method or not, it's just a guess.

Thanks!

Workings:

Let’s theorise the strain of a my tomato plant’s stem when subjected to a mild breeze.

let a=1    &lt;&lt;&lt;base curve of the tomato stem; a straight line

let b=(x^2 /-80)+1    &lt;&lt;&lt;approximate curve of the tomato stem during breeze

let l=10cm    &lt;&lt;&lt;length of the tomato stem

let h= area under the curve of a

let k= area under the curve of b

strain=((k-h)/h) * 100% = ((10-5.96)/10) * 100% = 40.4%

17,Is Mechatronics right for me?,1586753269,"This isn't the first sub I'm posting this to, but wanted additional opinions.
I go to a school where first year is general engineering courses and you commit to a major at the end of first year. Well, it's the end of first year. I'm stuck choosing between Computer Science and Mechatronics.

First off, I wanna specify that my university's Mechatronics program is mechatronics engineering technology, not mechatronics engineering. I have no idea how much of a difference this makes because mechatronics is a very hands-on degree in the first place but I figure its important to let you know that.

I've been tinkering with robots and machinery since a young age, and have always had a healthy interest in programming and engineering, building multiple large scale projects throughout my middle and high school years. Mechatronics is truly my dream major because it allows me to get involved with all the different aspects of building a robot- I hate being limited to just one part of the process. My concern though(and this may sound superficial to a lot of you) is that my salary as a mechatronics engineer will be low/insufficient for me. That's where I start looking at computer science. Being someone who's interested in all the different fields of robotics I've always had a healthy interest in programming. The thing is I'm not really a fan of the more complex math/theory that comp sci degrees go into, and I would hate to be limited to just the software side of things with no option to get my hands dirty building stuff. But I would be making a high salary.

My end goal is to be working in robotics/automation engineering, in some major city/metro area where things are lively and enjoyable, close to the outdoors, preferably in the U.S. but I'm open to any country because I know mechatronics is more established in places like Canada or Australia. I'm not sure how many cities fitting that bill have opportunities for mechatronics graduates. I'm honestly really wanting to do mechatronics because it's exactly what I've wanted to do with my life for the longest time but I just need convincing that there is a guarantee I'll get a high-paying job, especially given the fact that I'll have an engineering technology degree and not an engineering degree.

I want to go ahead with this and commit to mechatronics, I really do. Mechatronics is my love and passion and I really want to go into robotics/automation for my career. So is this the right choice?",AskEngineers,False,avinashlego,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g0c5eq/is_mechatronics_right_for_me/

At school, we had a 1 week machining class which I learned very little. The student team I joined didn't have access to a machine shop, so we ordered things to be made instead of making them. I took a CAD/CAM and CNC machining class in my fourth year and it was a disaster of a class (We spent 70% of the class learning how to mathematically create splines, curved surfaces and create a compiler program to convert some language into G-code).

The closest to experience I have is being an IT Technician for 6 months before getting laid off (not relevant to the pandemic). Got close several times with internships after an interview, but I never got anything. I spent 6 years in school with almost no extra-circulars to show. My capstone project was a literal shitty box. I already graduated with a BSME in December. I stupidly do not know how to do CAD. I did Autodesk Inventor in high school but never got around to anything solid like Creo or Solidworks when bouncing around from college to college. I have to get an internship or something because I have no skills to offer in a full-time job.

Where he explained that the universe has been expanding for a long long time and there is a lot of dark matter which is accelerating galaxies away from us. Now that got me thinking. New matter is being formed every unit of time at the ""boundary of the universe"" right? And if it is like a ripple then at each unit time ""the radius"" is increasing. Meaning that more matter has been formed x seconds than at x-1 seconds. Or that the rate of creation of matter is exponential. Now the new matter formed at this moment would definitely attract all of the galaxies and since there is so much of it, it will attract the galaxies at an increasing rate. Now this matter will be consistent with our definition of dark matter as in unobservable matter that is attracting observable matter. And this will take millenia before it is observable as it is millions of light years away. Since gravity is not bound by the upper limit of speed ie speed of light its effect will be exerted much before it is visible. So we can use the fact that galaxies are continually moving away from us to conclude that new matter is formed at the edge of the universe and that each second more matter is formed than the previous second.",AskEngineers,False,AgentK1309,/r/AskEngineers/comments/g0asaq/why_cant_we_conclude_that_dark_matter_is_matter/

I have my BS in Engineering Tech w/ a minor in Business Admin and MS in Industrial and Sys. Eng. 

My focus over the past three years has been with automation components (sensors, PLCs, cobots, etc.) as a controls/automation engineering role. I’m not a wizard like some engineers that I know, but I do pride myself on working hard and doing research if I don’t initially understand something. Personality wise, I’m social, competent with automation, and a good communicator- particularly if I’m talking with an engineer, I can switch to engineer jargon and back out of it as needed. 

From the outside looking in, sales is a bit intimidating from the fact that you’re not “welcome” to anyone’s time, at least not initially. Having not had formal sales training or experience (I’m currently reading books and watching videos to prepare as best as I can), my question is how difficult is it to penetrate accounts and make progress with customers? Is the learning curve pretty steep for sales skills or is it manageable to have success in the first year or so? 

Asking questions about the applications, getting the technical info, helping spec components doesn’t worry me as much as the “sales skills” aspect of it. I don’t like sleazy salespeople so I don’t want to be one.

So I'm a bus driver and spend a fair amount of time in my head contemplating our way of life as a species. In my spare time over the last few years I have been nurturing an aquaponics system. I always liked keeping fish, and not sure why it didn't click earlier, but when I saw a video on aquaponics it made so much sense. For those of you that don't know, aquaponics is a system that take the fish waste laden water and move it to a area full of plants. The plants clean the water using the waste for nutrients to grow. The now clean water is sent back to the fish, which, depending on type, can be eaten later. 

So after reading into this and finding a few reports that say it is more cost effect to have bigger system than small, I came up with the idea to make a mega system. In the spirit of arcologies like the X-See 4000, I thought  of one which would span 3000km to 4000km across a country (Canada), using the Pacific Ocean as an intake and the Atlantic ocean (or great lakes) as an out put. It would stand 1km tall and 1km wide. All the while storeing fresh water and growing food in the middle. Also housing the masses on top. 

I have made some very rough calculations using google and concluded this would hold approximately  the same amount of water humans use daily globally, would have the same area as global farmland use (over 17 floors) and could possibly house 1 billion plus people. All at the price tag of ~30 trillion dollars, coincidently that's almost the total amount of liquid money in the world, $36trillion.   

So yes I'm talking about the biggest things we would have ever been built by humans, but I am at a loss to how we as a species will decrease our footprint and negative impact to nature and the environment.

40,Can I go from car Mechanic to mechanical engineer?,1586733404,"My main question is: Would it be a good idea to become a car mechanic for a few years and then go into engineering?

I graduated in December 2019 with a B.S in Mechanical Engineering (USA) however, I still have yet to land a job due to my lack of experience, skills, and lack of networking. I am not entirely sure which area of mechanical engineering I want to work in. I also want to do mostly hands on work instead of run simulations and do CAD on a computer.

Meanwhile, I am working at a grocery store doing overnight stock (bc of coronavirus) and I plan to learn how to be a car mechanic at my local community college in the fall. Cars have always interested me but I have never worked on one or developed much understanding of them. I would prefer a more hands on job for now but I want to be able to transition to an office job later down the road.

41,On Submarine Telecom Cables and how to hypothetically split off a clandestine end point,1586729892,"Writer here doing some due dilligence before commiting words to paper. Now I doubt that I 'll have to show even a third of this to any future reader. But I feel I should know how this stuff works, myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So:

Say we're in a near future scenario where there are two countries separated by a large body of water and between them there's a submarine telecom cable to hook both of them up to the worldwide net.

Now the government of country A is somewhat dictatorially inclined and likes to censor its citizens' web access. Country B is not. The coastal lines of both countries are far enough out to allow for a stretch of international waters. 

Would any of the following be feasible for citizens of country A to access the uncensored data of country B without having to enter its territory:

A) An independent contractor locates a repeater unit in international waters. 

B) They inserts a branching unit. 

C) They attach their own cable to the branching unit.

D) They attach their own terminal node to that cable.

E) That end equipment is buried in the sand/floats in international waters.

F) That end equipment has access ports for fairly conventional applications, e.g. one could hook up a router to it.

G) All this activity can be, with some effort, covered up.

&amp;#x200B;

A i) if a repeater unit isn't feaible, would locating a branching unit work.

A i) if an independent contractor would not be able to pull this off, would the original contractor be able to complete steps C-G?

&amp;#x200B;

Now if there is any other stuff that seems silly or nonsensical in the above scenario. Please, do point it out.

44,Should I turn down a job offer because the salary is too....high?!,1586725989,"I'm sure this is the very rare ""They want to give me too much money"" post...and in this crazy time, I'm aware that this is a rather good problem to have. Nonetheless, it definitely feels like a problem to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the situation:

I graduated from a state University with a B.S. EE.  I am far from the smartest person ""in the room"", but I worked my butt off during school (and at my current job).  I graduated with the highest GPA of my major, was a member of Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society, and had some semi-interesting projects in/out of school that I added to my resume.

I graduated May 2019, and began work mid-June 2019.  The company I currently work for started me off with quite a fair salary for entry level EE, for my geo-location.  After 6 months, I rec'd a nice raise and was making what I feel is likely in the higher range of engineers with 6mos. experience, and still feel the same now at \~10mos. experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Content about my work at current company:

Since day one, things were busy, and there was one primary contract the team was working on.  Therefore my role became that of a support position.  Efforts included integration, bouncing back and forth between technician/engineering work, etc.  I never had a specific engineering/technical task that lasted longer than a week or so.  This is not a complaint either - I enjoyed working with the different team members, and aspects of the project.  I got to ask a lot of questions, and i couldn't be more lucky as it relates to the awesome people I got to work with on a day to day basis.

&amp;#x200B;

The job offer:

Occasionally I get these annoying emails from ZipRecruiter/Indeed/LinkedIn/etc.... I'm sure you see where this is going. For no real reason (aka I'm fairly content at my job and know that in the not-so-distant future I'll have some technically demanding tasking that will help me grow as an engineer), I saw an interesting job post in my inbox, so i updated my resume slightly, and ""1-click-applied.""

I didn't take it that serious upon applying, and figured at the best I would use it as interview practice or something of the sort.

Well, a quick screening email and 2 separate hour+ interviews (one zoom, and one call-in) and I was offered a position.  I figured I would get an offer based on the outcome of the interviews.  I explained everything honestly, and for the most part didn't even embellish - ""90% of the things you're asking me about on the resume, i did years ago, in school"", ""my technical professional experience is extremely limited, here's what it entails"" etc....

Salaries were never discussed. I feel as though I am a very hardworking Entry-Level EE, getting paid more than fairly.

The offer that was made to me included a generous sign-on bonus, with a salary increase of 25%. I have an offer for 6 figures while being less than a year from having graduated, and even less time gainfully employed.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem:

Certainly a good problem to have, i understand.  I have one week to respond with an answer, and I legitimately have no idea what to do.  Could this be a poor career move? If i get in over my head, or more is expected of me than I'm capable of producing, would being terminated make finding work difficult or stunt my career projection?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to think. I'm overwhelmed and immediately intimidated upon rec'ing the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking for any insight, advice, personal experiences, etc. from anyone that would like to offer some.

I find thermodynamics and similar chemistry related subjects very unpleasant and I do very badly in them, and the mechatronics engineering degree replaces these with electronics modules which I enjoy",1586723005,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice.  I'm nearing the end of my first year at university doing engineering, and we are given the option to change discipline.  I'm currently enrolled in mechanical engineering, but the first year is multidisciplinary.

Now, the important bit.  I hate all the chemistry-related subjects, I just don't understand them at all.  Thermodynamics included, it's just a big headache.  The electric/electronic modules are hard, but I find them more doable, albeit more labour-intensive, but I find it interesting and the practicals are enjoyable.

My university (Lancaster University, UK) does a mechatronics engineering program (accredited by the institute of mechanical engineering), which basically replaces all the chemistry-related modules with electronics modules.  This seems perfect uni wise, but in terms of job prospects, would I be disadvantaged by doing a mechatronics program if I wanted to do a straight mechanical engineering job?

73,Experiences/Reccomendations with Abaqus/standard on a AMD EPYC Naples mulitcore system?,1586684785,"Hello everyone,

I have a AMD Epyc 7551 (overclocked to 3 GHz) equipped with 8 memory modules (DDR4, 2666 MHz) and intend to use that system for composite material simulations (Unit cell and failure criteria).

After I've built the system I read, that Abaqus can't handle multiple cores efficiently when using implicit solving (with explicit it is apparently no problem). Of course I've done some reading before building the system and it was often stated, that the memory is the bottle neck (which is why I chose a server platform -&gt; 8 lanes instead of 4).

Now my question: Have any of you used Abaqus/standard on such a system and can you give me any tips (to achieve high performance with this multicore setup)? Or am I better of using ANSYS?

I am not yet familiar with Abaqus, so switching to Ansys would not be a big deal.

If anyone reading this has any practical experience: Does Abaqus haveGPU support for these kind of problems? I am thinking about getting a Quadro K6000 to support the CPU.

83,How do I calculate the size of a blank to cut a new gear?,1586666839,"I am posting this using a mobile device, so I am limited with respect to formatting and symbols etc.

G’day from Australia; I have been working on aircraft since the ‘80s and have a problem that I feel is just beyond my grasp. I was talking to my father-in-law today; he’s a tinkerer and has a fairly well-equipped workshop, including a lathe. He wants to replace one of the gears buried in the guts of this lathe, using said lathe to cut the new gear - this means he doesn’t want to pull the lathe apart to gain access to the gear and measure it. He cannot get vernier calipers into a position that will allow him to measure the diameter of the gear in question.

It occurs to me that all of the gears in the gear train must have the same-size teeth, because they all mesh with each other. This leads me to the thought that he could measure the diameter (let’s say d1) of a gear that is accessible and count its teeth (t1), then use this to calculate the diameter of the 29-tooth (t2) gear that he wants to replace. So, given d1, t1 and t2, is there a formula to calculate d2? 

For argument’s sake, let’s say the gear of diameter d1 has 58 teeth, which is 2 x 29; if my thinking is correct, the circumference of one gear is twice the circumference of the second gear, so as far as I can see, t1d1 = 2*pi*d2. More generally, t1d1 = (t1/t2)*pi*d2, so d2 = t1d1/{(t1/t2)*pi*}. Is this correct? Is my thinking off track with respect to all the gears in the train having commonality in the size of their teeth?

I will have my first internship this summer. I have constantly taken the highest level courses available to me and I get good grades, but I have terrible self confidence.

What scares me:

1. I feel I don't have enough experience. I have not taken many classes where I had to design something. I am scared that I will get to a job and be so out of my depth that I'll crumble.
2. I have never been able to do homework in a sane amount of time without chegging questions. I have always memorized the 'algorithm' needed to solve a problem in any class. I think I am good at test taking but not good at engineering. To add to that, my long term memory isn't great. I constantly need to open my old textbooks up and refresh myself even for things last semester.
3. I lean on my colleagues a lot for help in class.
4. I am not good at analytically finding solutions to abstract problems (i.e. I took dynamics II which had Lagranian and Hamiltonian mechanics and rotodynamics (&amp; rotoshaft stability) I got by with the skin of my teeth)
5. I feel like I'm not creative enough. The best way I learn is by seeing someone else do something a couple times. I am not good at creating new concepts. I prefer to do tried-and-true methods.

What gives me hope:

1. I get good marks on my projects.
2. I am resourceful and take good notes, read all the assigned reading, ask colleagues for help, and when all else fails I know how to make good queries on Google.
3. I really enjoy learning and I like reading papers (even though a lot of the math is nonsense to me).
4. I am a fast learner.
5. Even though I feel like I have forgotten a lot, if I refresh myself it generally comes back to me.
6. I will graduate with both a masters and bachelors at the same time (my university allows undergrads to take grad courses on day one, not recommended, but possible).

I scared that I will fail on the job because I learned to be good at exams and chegg homework. My terrible memory really scares me. For example,right now I understand the general concepts of heat transfer but I would not be able to find/estimate the convection coefficient for a part made in CAD.

88,Are my reservations about engineering unfounded?,1586661876,"(Apologizes for bad grammar and wall of text, I’m on mobile. Attempt at TL;DR at the end) 

Background: Hello, I’m a high school student with an interest in engineering, specifically electrical engineering. I think engineering would be a good fit for me because I do like math and physics more than English and History, and I love games like KSP and Minecraft. However, lately, I am not so in love with the idea of engineering. My main concerns are:

1. I feel that if I were to work for a larger company or corporation, that I’d just be working to make someone else richer, and just be a cog in a machine.

2. A statement I’ve seen thrown around a lot is that engineering has a relatively low salary ceiling, compared to your starting salary. I’ve read that engineers may have a starting salary of 70k, however, their maximum earning potential might top out at a little over 100k. I do understand that moving into management or sales can increase your salary, However, I don’t know if I want to go into those jobs. I like the prospect of engineering because you get to apply math and physics to solve problems and create things. Instead, I feel as though managerial roles are more business oriented, as opposed to actual engineering. (I don’t know if this is really case, but this is the vibe I’m getting from other posts)

3. This is a relatively minor point, but it still is something I think about. I have read that,  early on, you do have to move a lot to move up in your field. I did have to move a lot during my childhood, and I didn’t enjoy it in the slightest. While I wouldn’t be opposed to moving twice in 15 years, I wouldn’t want to move every 2 years just for a minor salary increase.

4. My final, and perhaps most important point, I worry about actually being interested in my job. As much as I would love to work at someplace like JPL or a national lab, I feel that I would be unhappy designing something like ceiling fans for a living (No offense to ceiling fan engineers, it just isn’t my cup of tea). I just want a job where I get to make my mark on the world and feel proud at what I’ve accomplished. 

I apologize if I sound lazy and entitled in this post, as this was not my intention. I do understand I’m not going to land some six figure dream job a NASA straight out of college. However, as seen above, I do have some reservations about the prospect of engineering, and do worry that I will be slaving my life away in some cube for 40 years. Thank you for reading if you got is far :)

TL;DR: I worry that with engineering, I’ll be a poorly paid cog in a machine designing vacuum cleaners for some faceless billionaire. Are my concerns valid?",AskEngineers,False,Saberclaw11,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fzp560/are_my_reservations_about_engineering_unfounded/
89,Civil Engineer - Should I take the job offer?,1586659995,"I am having a very hard time deciding what to do with my career as I have a new job offer on the table. Let me start with a little background about myself.

I'm a 30 year old male, civil engineer, divorced but in new relationship, oh and have a dog.

I have been with the same company for my entire career (7 years) my boss has been extremely good to me and I truly loved what I do, and the people that I work with. There is a very good social aspect with the group as a large portion are around my age. I have put a lot of effort into trying to build this group up, and have hired a good group of younger engineers on my project team, it has been a whole lot of fun to watch them grow. All of that being said, I am starting to doubt our corporate executives and I don't see much more room for upward mobility in this company, I think my ceiling is not much higher.

Tee up a few weeks ago and I am approached by a new company looking for someone to fill a roll on their construction site that would be a lot of responsibility. This company is the owner of the site and has plans for many more future facilities. After a few discussions and actually meeting with the CEOs of the company, they have extended me an offer that I'm not sure I ever thought I would receive in my lifetime.

Pay increase - 60% (105k-&gt;165k)

All health and life insurance - 100% covered by company

Much better 401k match &amp; Equal bonus opportunity

I specialize in industrial/chemical/petrochemical facility design and work with multi-disciplines. This would be a change in career trajectory because I would go from a design/engineering roll to a construction/quality control roll. But this company has much more upward growth potential as it is a large corporation. So pros/cons!

Pros:

1. Major pay increase
2. Upward mobility
3. Better benefits
4. Good resume builder
5. Expand my construction knowledge (improves future marketability)

Cons:

1. Relocation (2 hrs away from current residence)
2. Long commute even after relocation (1 hr. Drive each way)
3. Change in career trajectory
4. I know no one and very little about the company.
5. Less work/life balance and social life.
6. Impact on current relationship (even though she is being super supportive and saying she will be there no matter the decision)

I have a lot of emotional ties to the group I work with currently as my boss has been probably the best boss a person could ask for. He has treated me extremely well and given me every opportunity to grow as fast as I could handle. I have thoroughly enjoyed working for him.

I believe this job opportunity would not only grow my career but I believe it would also help me grow as an individual and it would be a new difficult challenge to try and undertake.

I am a senior in highschool and am currently dual enrolled my local community in a mechanical engineering technology program and have over a year of credit under my belt that transfers directly to the local university( Old Dominion University). All programs are ABET accredited, both MET and ME. I am also in the process of Initial entry training (IET) for the National Guard, and plan on getting commissioned as an officer after I graduate.


Having this in mind, I've been thinking about whether or not I should switch from MET. I know that there are different types of engineering functions that can be done by both, and the different job opportunities of both. And I feel MET is more suited to me and enjoy it emencly. Though I like the outlook of ME better. Simply put, after I'm done with the military I think I'll have more opportunities as an ME. 

I've been told that I ask theorieticial questions in classes like statics and have been told that I'd be suited for both programs. This is why I'm split.

Other concern of mine is time over money, being that it will take around 1-2 more semesters to graduate. Though with various scholarships and tuition assistance with the National guard  I have no money or loan concerns, all is paid for. 

This being said, would switching be worth it? Or should I stick to MET and graduate on a shorter time table and start working as an officer sooner?

5,How limiting will my career aspects be if I pursue a degree in environmental engineering technology vs. environmental engineering?,1586642505,"To clarify, the environmental engineering technology degree offered by my university is a four year degree and not to be confused with a technician.

For example, I would only take a year of calculus and one semester of physics.

My question is just how much of a difference will this make in my career options?  If I were to go on and get a masters in environmental engineering down the road, would I be just as competitive with other engineers with masters?

24,"I have an Internship and accepted a job offer at Company A, having second thoughts about potential at Company B... How do I navigate this professionally?",1586612360,"Hello! I am an Aerospace Engineering student graduating in a month. I'm in a bit of a crossroads deciding what I should do. I want to maintain professionalism and not screw over anyone but I also don't want to handicap my career early on. I'll attempt to keep this brief without leaving out too many necessary details.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently work at Company A as an intern in Department A. I've been here for the past 1.5 years. I love the team I work with and I have accepted a (rather good) job offer a few months ago that starts right after I graduate in May. Problem is, Company A is a big Semiconductor, so the work itself isn't terribly relevant to anything I've learned in school, most of what I do is related to Industrial Engineering. The first maybe half of the internship was a bit of a mess, I was in the first round of interns this particular Department ever hired. Due to that and my lack of background in IE, I find myself struggling to understand a lot of stuff that our newest hire (Who's been here 6 months as a full time engineer, was an IE student) has picked up on much quicker. My department had hired 5 interns with me and only kept me, they sent off the rest to other departments within the company for various reasons. They've been training me to take over a lot of functions of one of the more senior engineers to free him up for other stuff too. Due to all of that and the fact that I really like the people I work with, I'm very hesitant to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, like I mentioned I'm not an IE or EE/ChemE major so it's hard for me to get a grasp on a lot of what's going on. There's a large Aerospace Defense Contractor a mile up the street from me (Company B) that is hiring like mad. I know this because I have a professor that's one of the higher ups in that particular company. He teaches my capstone class and he told me this and suggested I go apply. I hold this company in very high regard and was planning  on trying to get a job there anyway. Once all the Corona stuff hit I lost hope but it looks like they're going strong according to my professor, a couple people I know that work there, and their stock. I am much more interested in the work they do and would take a pay cut to work there too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't yet have a solid offer from Company B yet, so this is all hypothetical. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to screw over my current team by going back on the job offer I accepted but I also VERY much want to start off in the Aerospace industry ASAP. I've had a passion for aerospace in general since I was like 7. If I do get a decent job offer from Company B I think I'd take it over the current offer I've accepted at Company A. How should I go about navigating this? Do I wait for a decent job offer from Company B before saying anything to my current manager? I don't think I should say anything before I have anything solid, but on the other hand I feel I owe a little bit of extra notice to these guys who've treated me so well over the past year plus. Especially since I accepted Company A's job offer sometime back in February (granted it was all I had at that point, hadn't even had an interview with any other company).",AskEngineers,False,jfizzle232,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fz5ftq/i_have_an_internship_and_accepted_a_job_offer_at/

30,Designing a low pressure eductor,1586584035,"Hi! I am proficient in Fusion 360 and 3d Printing. However, I am not a physics major. I am hoping can help me with some very rough calculations on a venturi eductor for removing air from a fume hood.

A difference to other designs I found is that I am using for the motive fluid relatively low pressure air out of a 6"" 400cfm duct blower. This is instead of a a high pressure (50psi+) pneumatic design,  or one that uses water as the motive fluid for lifting sand/mud etc. 

I do understand at the lower pressure of a 6"" duct, I would get more flow if I instead just used the input to my fan to handle the fumes. My understanding is that with less of an available pressure drop between these fluids, I will get less negative pressure and therefore flow from my fume hood trying to use a venturi. 

So I am NOT saying I am actually going to print this and use it- ( I may have to just sacrifice my fan to spray paint).. but I would LOVE to model it in Fusion 360 so I can at least visualize how big it would have to be. If it's reasonable I would love to get it silced, printed, give it a try and see how well it works.

 
I will be using 6"" duct to move air around. I am near sea-level and 65F temperature though I suspect those details won't matter as much as the CFM of the fan in a 6"" round duct.

What eductor/venturi design is best?
How large should my nozzle be (restriction in front of the fan, into the venturi unit)?
How large should the fume input be? I assume 6 is adequate 
How large should the throat, or output restriction be (if any?) .

These and other variables for how long each of these converging and diverging sections should be are also totally out of my understanding despite the reading I've done, and calculators I've looked for. LMNO Engineering was the first one I found and they want $40, though I think their calculator could get it done for me. Is there any easier way for a laymen? CFD simulations online are pretty cool, but even knowing something about CAD I dont think the effort to set all that up is going to be required just for my little curiosity here. 



Can you help a novice maker out? I'd be happy to print and send you something you need free-of-charge in exchange. (My things are /r/functionalprint s )  I am not looking for exact, but to know the range of a pretty efficient design is my humble request.

45,[Mechanical] I need help identifying a very small thread on a part taken from an old camera,1586562606,"https://imgur.com/a/nUt91Az

Here's the best picture I could take with my equipment - the scale on the ruler is in mm. I know it's crude but I don't have calipers or a thread gauge, so I was hoping maybe it would be possible to identify the thread based on these pictures? I've tried M1.2, M1.4 and M2 nuts on it. The first 2 were too small, while the M2 seemed to have the right size, but wouldn't screw on because the threads didn't match. Maybe it's an Imperial screw?

Based on this picture I was able to calculate the pitch as about 0.4117 mm but I couldn't find any fitting metric nuts.

For context, these parts were taken from the autofocus system of an Olympus Stylus Epic film camera. There is a gear attached to the threaded shaft and when it turns it moves along a stationary nut, which allows the entire lens assembly to move back and forth. However, the thread on the nut is completely worn out and flat, so instead of moving when the shaft turns, the entire lens just kinda slides back and forth without much resistance.

I'm hoping a simple replacement of the worn nut will be enough, but I guess if it's a completely custom thread I'll have to get another one of these cameras for parts.

Last two times, I sucked it up, and after a day or two went right back it and did some good work.

Was hired at a FAANG \~2 weeks ago as a senior data engineer. Was completely honest on my resume and interview process regarding what I know. 

What has been thrown on my plate, which all needs to be done in 2 weeks at the latest from this Friday:

1. Build an application + CLI that communicates with custom API, AWS API + other vendor API for customer facing data ingestion into S3
   1. Trigger Airflow DAGs workflows for downstream processes (RDS/Redshift transforms)
   2. Must push and pull metadata from DynamoDB (Requires additional data modeling here)
   3. Authentication with Cognito, LDAP, and others
   4. Session handling
   5. Aggregate logging through Splunk/DynamoDB
2. Set-up Neo4j and AWS Neptune for POC and import legacy data in RDF/SPARQL
   1. Rewrite old queries and new ones in gremlin
3. Setting up ECS/EKS for data validation and curation services
4. Setup Fargate with SQS and Airflow DAG for entirely new step within workflow
5. Take over Jenkins for CI/CD of a bunch of systems  


So here's the problem. I didn't know Airflow until last week, and that's barely now, let alone the internal infrastructure we've built on top of it. 

I don't know Neo4j, Neptune, RDF, SPARQL, Gremlin, ECS, EKS, Fargate, SQS, Jenkins. I've used AWS SDK for s3 and EC2, but never through the rest API.

 I absolutely do not understand our in-house systems and their APIs. I've never used DynamoDB or Splunk. I've set up LDAP before, but not in such a way were it's coming through Azure, and then having to somehow chain to Cognito and create persistent sessions across a complex of roles.

I can't even wrap my head around the stack we are using... and I have no idea how I am going to begin to write code when I don't even understand how half tools work? 

I set up a meeting with my manager and asked ""What are the expectations? Am I meeting them?"" and he vaguely answered until he had to abruptly leave for another meeting.

So, the company I work for, is for sale. It is a small company, ~150 people, but for the industry it is in, it is a top 5 company. That being said, the founder and CEO has been around for quite a while and is looking to sell. 

It's been for sale for a number of years now, but deals keep falling through. The current potential buyer is a similar company, that is slightly smaller. They are being backed by a giant investment firm that wants to get involved in the industry. I just started in December, I love it, and I've accomplished a great deal in a short amount of time.

1) If I were to damage the motor how would it happen? If I really absolutely must have good coordinate between timing and throttle, can I do this myself? I have a meche masters but not much hands on engine experience or knowledge besides thermo. Are there recommended resources/books?

2) Is there an ""safe/easy"" way, perhaps by sacrificing performance, to coordinate the throttle/timing? For example, if I leave the timing lever mechanism mechanically connected to the hand control but disconnect the throttle, then the driver can fully advance timing before the throttle gets opened by the cruise control?

The pay is decent, the hours aren’t terrible, but I don’t want to be in this career any longer than it takes for me to be financially independent. For anyone not familiar with tech programs, classes that someone in a Mechanical Eng. program took 2nd or 3rd year, we’re 4th year classes for me.

Eng. or a Mechatronics degree, but at the moment, I don’t know what my career options are for using these skills. 

If I were to describe my dream job, I would use the analogy of a construction contractor or carpenter. A client comes to them because they have the skill set of building a home or similar structure. The contractor does not design the home, but uses the tools he/she has learned and helps guide the client through through building the home they have designed/bought plans for, offering improvement ideas based on the best practice of the day, and begins building with the physical tools he has worked to acquire. Someone who improves designs using a specific skill set, but does not design primarily.

Some things I have looked at:

1. Design Engineer. Our design department is in another state, but I want to reach out to someone there and learn what their day to day job is like. Hopefully do a informational interview with some team members and see what skills they utilize. 

2. I have seen job postings for “Design Validators”, which my understanding is, they only confirm designs of other people through prototype or modeling and offer improvement ideas based on the result. This is the closest to my contractor analogy I have found in reality.  

3. Metrology/sensor and measurement device development. Seems like sensors use more of the fundamental properties of physics/engineering such as knowledge of electro-magnetic field for prox sensors, or optics for thru-beam sensors and vision sensors.

84,"When PTFE is at the risk of melting, what heat-resistant insulation is a contender?",1586508971,"Hi All,

TL:DR - what rigid, non-custom material can be used as a heat insulator up to 350C+ ?

I'm in the process of designing a small melt-tip drill to deploy scientific instruments in solid ice with the Geological Survey of Greenland. The concept is that a solid copper block (diameter 50mm) is heated up with internal heating elements and allowed to melt through several hundred feet through solid ice, which then freezes around the drill once it's at depth - a one-way trip.

It's important to direct the heat towards the tip to melt downwards and not let it escape from the sides, which would widen the hole and greatly decrease efficiency. Some colleagues at a different scientific survey had built a similar system using PTFE tube around their copper block to block the heat from escaping out of the sides, and we've opted for a similar approach - but I underestimated how hot our copper would get. Our drill is run at higher wattages, and some initial testing in a cold water bath showed that the internal temperature reached 200C in a matter of seconds. PTFE's maximum service temperature is around 260C (500F) before it starts to deteriorate, and this is way too close for comfort. Rough theoretical calculations hint that our regular working temperatures during payout should hover below 100C, but if the drill ever stalls or gets stuck, temperatures will ramp up very quickly.

I've been trying to find a rigid material that acts as a heat insulator and is safe to use at higher temperatures. The probe is held together by a tightening bolt, so it was convenient to have a firm, 3mm PTFE tube to press fit around the copper and tighten down from the top. I am open to changing the design of how it's held together if the new material doesn't fit this method. Ideally I'm looking for something off the shelf that I can machine or fit; custom alloys or polymers that involve huge manufacturing processes / huge order quantities are not particularly desirable.

(additional note: the insides of the probe are filled with a high temperature, electronics potting resin to avoid moisture ingress, and I've done away with the graphite gaskets shown in the diagram). 

Any tips appreciated! I figured one of you probably has dealt with a similar problem.

I connected the sensing resistors in series with the reactive elements, and I figured that if I used resistors of any magnitude (I used 1k ohms), the phase angle would not be affected as the sensing resistors would only be affecting the real part of the impedance, not the phase angle which, in my understanding, is only affected through reactive elements.

7,Is this the correct way to determine the number of tests I need to run to have X% confidence we've found all the bugs in a system?,1586469754,"I'm in the middle of a few projects at work where I'm developing software for embedded systems in consumer robotics. I'm separated from manufacturing by a few layers so I write the software on a test system that may or may not resemble the final system once production comes round. It sucks. We end up running live tests with users and relying on them to report bugs back to us, versus having you know, like a normal QA department. There are so many problems with this, I don't even know where to begin. I end up patching stuff a week or two before production begins, and we end up re-running tests again and again to retest the patches. It works, if only barely and the time-crunched nature of it all makes for some prime mushroom management.

&amp;#x200B;

Well this time I stuck my neck out a bit, I said I think we can be a bit more intelligent with our methods. I figured there has to be some way to determine the number of tests we need to run to find all the bugs. That is opposed to just running test after test right up until production begins hoping we find most of them. My goal is to be able to say ""I am 95% confident that we will find 95% of bugs after running 100 tests"". So I'm shooting from the hip here a bit, but that's where I'm starting.

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered Cochran's Theorem from my statistics class^(I googled it.) and thought that might be a good place to start? 

&amp;#x200B;

ideal sample size = Z\^2 \* p \* q / e\^2

&amp;#x200B;

The test will represent one use, and all the tests will represent the entire population. I'm calling each member of the population a single use of the device. My total population represents how many uses will occur in the first five years from the date production begins on all devices sold in those years. I end up with a population of \~750000 uses. Our population is large enough, we don't need to adjust for small size.

&amp;#x200B;

Z comes from the z score tables. Put in desired confidence, get z value out.

&amp;#x200B;

p is the probability that the sample has the attribute (test uncovers a bug). We've ran these tests before a significant number of times, so I'll use empirical data from that to come up with p here. q is 1-p.  

e is the error, and in this case I'm calling it 1 - confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

Plug it all in and get your desired sample size, in other words the number of tests we need to have some confidence that some percentage of bugs was found.

I personally really want to get an engineering degree and for a time it seemed ASU was my only option, but I am not sure I want to do that anymore.

I have question on deciding what to take as a datum feature in GD&amp;T and how to interpret them. I know that one thing about defining datum is to constraint part in space. Since I have in my example cylindrical part I have to decide what will be my datum features. 

So as I mention I have cylindrical part with slot in his center. 

Example: I am using bottom flat surface of this part as my primary datum A, for secondary datum I take axis of this part and it is datum B, and for tertiary datum C I am using center plane of slot inside of this part. Here is [image](https://ibb.co/zVpFkHq) how it looks. Here is my question in this case if I don't have datum C, will this part be fully constrained since I took datum feature B as axis of part, or I need also to define datum feature C as a center plane of slot to fully constraint this part? 

Or I can just take datum A as bottom surface of part and center plane of this slot as datum feature B, and with this I solved my issue because in this case part is fully constrained. Here is [image.](https://ibb.co/56wcwKn)

32,Which career path should I take?,1586450369," Sorry for the long post. I don't know if it's because I've been stuck inside for the past 3 weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic, but I think I'm having a quarter life crisis...

Basically, I'm trying to figure out what career path to take. Some background info: I'm about halfway through my undergrad, majoring in chemical engineering and minoring in computer science (data analytics). I go to a top engineering school that likes to kick every student's ass, so while my GPA is not bad, I don't think it's enough for grad school (although I think I could get into my school's online masters program). I've worked as a lab/research intern, but did not particularly enjoy it. Here are some options I've been considering:

1. Graduate and go straight into industry as a process engineer, work for 2-4 years, get an online Masters in CS or Analytics while working, switch over into consulting and get an MBA
2. Go straight into consulting when I graduate and get an MBA
3. Try and get a software development internship before I graduate, graduate and then work in the software development industry (I really like CS, but I also really like ChemE and I feel like this route would just be such a waste of my entire undergrad :/ )
4. Graduate and work as a process engineer
5. other suggestions??

I know most of these paths result in me not working a traditional chemE job. However, this is mostly due to the fact that I know I will be miserable if I end up in the middle of nowhere. I am aiming for a northeastern city like Boston or NYC (for a lot of reasons- family, my SO will most likely want to end up there, but most importantly I'm happiest when I'm in a big city- NYC is my favorite place in the world). I know I'm limiting myself by this, but I am interested in pharma/consumer goods, and I know there are some plants up there. I also think consulting is something I would really like. No matter what I do, though, I would like to make six figures early on (although this might be due to family pressure), if possible.

I would like to work at least 3 more terms before I graduate, so I guess I could try out different industries to see what I like most. I guess my main question is - which of these paths would best set me up for my long term goals/is most practical? Is there anyone else who's taken a similar path and could offer some advice/guidance?

I believe I'm good at my job, I had several raises and promotions at my last job, and I think I have good social team skills and am pleasant to work with. The company has a good amount of work, but I'm at a complete loss to find a place/role and I could use some help.

My manager is a classic ""we need a manager - grab the most senior engineer even though he doesn't want to ever deal with people and make him do the job"". He doesn't usually respond to emails (he's also somehow still doing technical work, that's how little he wants to manage), and my second week when I was trying to understand what I should do he sends me a spreadsheet listing possible department needs for people. They were half wrong, but whatever, I spent the next couple weeks literally cold-calling people and sending out my resume to them (even though I had already started working there).

My company-assigned mentor is (this isn't meant to be mean or judgemental so apologies if this comes across poorly), very likely on the autism spectrum. He's hard to talk to and impossible to direct the topic of conversation for more than 10 seconds unless it's on something that interests him, his work, or his 3d printing hobby. Easily distracted and not super interested in talking about other people then himself.

Project managers are nice when I reach out to them, but they're trying to staff their projects with the very senior people that they know well, and they know will do the job. We run our projects lean on people, and they don't want to take risks - they want Mr/Mrs. Subject Matter Expert. When I do get involved on a project, I believe I do a good job. But almost without fail we'll get to a tricky part (because there's always one in this field) and it's instantly ""oh we should ask XX person to get involved - they designed a very similar system that we could leverage and shortcut through this problem."" And then suddenly I'm on the back burner, and the 60 year old pro whose been at the company for 30 years and knows exactly every procedure, process, person to talk to and knows this technical niche better than me is running the show. It feels like a contest of who can get involved in the most projects. I don't know if that's a job security thing, ego, or what. And it's not a wrong decision for the PMs to make - it's quite logical! These people are really good at there stuff. I'm not bad at it of course, but I don't know the companies processes, and I'm not as experienced as them.

I'm really at a loss of what to do. New hires are usually either young and put in better mentor positions and given lots of grunt work to learn the basics, or senior and hired directly for specific big projects to fill a specific need. I was a weird hire of a good semi-senior person but without a specific role.

57,Using fuel tank sumps tied together on a dual tank vehicle,1586396064,"Good evening AskEngineers!



There's not an ""automotive"" flair so I picked mechanical.  I'm electrical by degree and trade. 



I've got a 9th Generation Ford pickup with a 7.3 L diesel engine.  The truck has the famed dual-tank setup, with the selector valve. Since it's a diesel, the selector valve manages both fuel supply and return.



The selector valve is prone to fail and expensive.  I don't like how it limits fuel supply into my aftermarket electric pump either.  I'm using a junkyard valve now since my OEM 1997 model valve failed a couple of years ago. 



The rear tank pickup has failed, somehow, as well.  The truck loses fuel pressure when I switch to it and the return fuel becomes foamy - like air is being sucked into the system. 



So, what I'd like to do, is replace the 19 gallon rear tank with a 38 gallon Bronco tank.   I'd also like to keep the midship (front) tank.  The pickup / sending unit wouldn't work in the 38 gallon tank if it hadn't failed, due to the depth of the tank.



To accomplish this, I want to use bottom mounted sumps.  I want to install a sump in the bottom of each tank, and tie them with a 1/2"" fuel line with -8AN fittings. The sumps have two outlets - so one outlet in the rear tank will be plugged.  The midship will have an outlet tied to the rear, and the supply line will use the other outlet.  



I'm planning to install a check ball between the midship and rear - so if I fill the midship tank first, it won't back-flow into the rear.  And I can park uphill and it won't run to the rear tank and starve the pump for fuel. 



I think it'll work to supply from the midship and return to the rear.  The top level of fuel in each tank should always remain the same, or the midship will be higher due to the check ball, correct?  (thinking hydraulic grade line).  If the rear tank is thicker / deeper, I'll not be able to use that capacity - because it will force fuel out of the midship tank's vent.



I won't have a level gauge in the rear tank at all, and I plan to direct wire the midship sending unit to the gauge (since the selector valve also manages electrical connectivity and will be gone).



The major limitation I see is being able to ""flood"" the midship tank.   Fuel sumps and lines will be protected by skid plates. I will also have the ability to pick up water and other nasties that a conventional top mount pickup tube (""straw"") avoids, but I'll also be able to quickly drain the crap from my tanks.

72,Is an inverted cylinder wet-seal piston a viable alternative for the mechanical bellows in an open source emergency ventilator design?,1586375042,"I teach Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer for the Mechanical Engineering department at a college in the northeast and am a licensed PE. My colleagues and I are trying to design and prototype a viable, cheap, reliable, easily-deployed, and safe ventilator for COVID patients suffering from ARDS. One of the components we're exploring, as we use [this for guidance](https://panvent.blogspot.com/), is a way to deliver consistent, precise, and metered air volume at a constant pressure. I proposed [this idea](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NtHTpWqTHeABIOWKSyClQrKFVJpG-q_9), but haven't had time to fully analyze it. I'm eliciting this forum for thoughts on its viability as a substitute for mechanical bellows. It's a cylinder (bucket), inverted, with the open end immersed in a water bath contained within a bigger cylinder. The rise and fall of the inner cylinder creates a piston effect with the water surface, where overpressure is regulated by weight added to the inner bucket (and easily measured/observed) by the differential water height between the outer and inner buckets. Volume is controlled by the vertical travel. There's a video of Version 0.01, using a 2 gallon bucket with 1-way flapper valves inspired by this [video](https://youtu.be/70uvPq1JWNM) inside a 5 gallon bucket, along with the pdf's in the google drive folder I linked. The inner bucket could either be inflated with regulated compressed air/oxygen, or be mechanically lifted and replenished with atmospheric air prior to ""freesinking"" down at a constant rate for delivery to the patient.

Issues like humidification may actually be a desirable side effect, but could be controlled by using a flexible, loose, impermeable membrane that sits on the interior water surface. Keeping the water sterile could be accomplished with a submerged UV light, like a [Steripen](https://www.katadyn.com/us/us/36833-ULT-MP-Ultra).

I'm looking for thoughts on its viability &amp; optimization. Is my theory on it being able to give finely-controlled delivered volume at constant pressure sound?

which I want to re-write as:

Ptot^(g)  = Ptot^(abs) \-  2\*P^(atm)

But if you simply told me the absolute pressure of a system was Ptot^(abs) , I would tell you the gauge pressure was:

Ptot^(g)  = Ptot^(abs) \-  1\*P^(atm)

So I guess my question is:  What is the correct way to add two gas pressures?  My intuition tells me that you can only add absolute pressures, then subtract off atmostpheric once to get the net gauge pressure.  But figured I'd ask the community.  Thanks!

That was going to be a problem, though, since the 5gal. jug would be (as most are) transparent so I'd cover that (wrap it with some type of material, idk yet), but the funnel would still let light through. In that case then, I needed a way that running water could stay lit (just due to not being able to prevent it), and then attaching that to a small depository with a hose/pipe leading down to the jug, that would gradually fill up with water and allow me to harvest rain water for various things like watering my indoor plants and..... well I haven't thought that far.

It’s regarding a low suction pressure switch. It’s not operating as it should and at the moment we can’t get access to any drawings or download the plc program. We are trying to understand whether it will inhibit the pump from running if the tank is empty or if it will cut the pump out while it’s running if the tank was to go empty.
(Although both case scenarios should work in my opinion)

36,How to Decide if it's Worth Relocating for a Job?,1586303810,"A little background. I graduated last May with a Bachelor of Environmental Engineering and have my EIT. I started applying for jobs during my last semester but didn't have much luck(couple interviews no follow ups). In July I ended up landing a job at a small lab, which well better than being unemployed but is otherwise very crappy. The pay is bad($17/hr), I don't get any benefits (insurance ect) and it has hardly any relevance to my degree. I've kept applying for jobs while working there and last Friday I was offered a job in Baltimore. The position is in stormwater management and waterway restoration which is something I'm pretty interested in( though it's hard to say if I'll really enjoy it because I have little real world experience). It has a pretty good salary and good benefits. I know how lucky I am to even have this opportunity given what is going on in the world but I'm still not sure if I want to accept it. First off, it's a conditional offer because they're not doing background checks or drug tests right now due to COVID-19. Also I currently live in Minneapolis so it's a pretty significant relocation. My Dad is from Baltimore so I spent a good amount of time there as a kid and also did a summer REU on the eastern side of the Chesapeake bay so I know that I like the area. But, I don't have any friends or relatives there so if I did move out there I would be pretty much on my own. Lastly, I'm pretty close with my parents(actually currently live with them) and I'm getting the vibe that they really don't want me to take it. I know in the end it's a desicion that I have to make on my own regardless of what my parents think and maybe I'm just using their input as an excuse for me not being able to decide. I have until friday to accept or decline. That seemed like a long time a few days ago but now it's been like 4 days and I feel like I haven't made any progress toward making a desicion. One question I have is would it be bad to ask for an extension to decide? It's with the government so I feel like they probably wont give me one anyway.

37,Should I go back for my Master's Degree during job market stagnation? Interested in Flight Test Engineering.,1586303431,"Hello all,

So, some background. I am a recent ME graduate (December 2019), and I have been hitting the job search pretty hard starting around January. In late February I got an interview with a company as a tooling engineer. The interview went very well, HR even reached out to me and confirmed everyone thought I would be a great fit. I was told I should expect a call the following week to confirm if I got an offer or not... I'm guessing you can figure out where this is heading.

To cut it short, the position at said company was put on hold due to COVID-19. I've been in contact with the HR rep, and I was told that if he hears anything about the position (or any other openings) I will be the first person he calls. However, I am holding back too much hope something will come of this any time soon.

My job search has gotten progressively more bleak as time has passed as well. Many positions I was being considered for have been put on hold or fully canceled.

After all of this, I am beginning to consider other options. Currently, I am debating going back for my master's degree while the job market is a bit stagnated. I viewed the tooling engineer as a great opportunity to expand my technical skills as an engineer, but it was not a position I wanted to pursue long term.

Most of my experience is in manufacturing, but I recently achieved my Private Pilot License and have gotten deeply more interested in aviation. From job searching, A flight test engineer (FTE) sounds like a very interesting position and something I am heavily considering working towards.

So, here are some questions I would like to bounce off you guys. Would you considering going back for your Master's during this uncertainty in the job market? What would be the best course of action to pursue a position as a FTE? Should I go for a Master's degree in Aerospace? Should I just stick to job hunting and find a position that will build experience towards becoming a FTE?

56,Does it make sense to own a small electric oven for small dishes if you already have a large one?,1586284445,"Sorry for such a mundane question, but I didn't really know where else to put it, given that it has to do with electric design and physics more than with actual cooking.

I have an [IKEA Matalskare](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/mataelskare-forced-air-oven-stainless-steel-colour-10368781/) oven in my kitchen. It's pretty big, and can cook two or even three large dishes at the same time.

It only rarely happens that I have that much food to cook. The majority of the times I turn it on it's to cook a refrigerated pizza, or a plate's worth of chicken. Nothing that needs the full size of the oven, or its full power - depending on setting it usually runs at 1800 (fan heater) or 2650W (top and bottom elements). 

Having a fairly spacious kitchen, I'm thinking I could add a small countertop oven - generally called ""toaster"" oven - to it. A fairly small unit - say, 26L, about what's needed to fit a supermarket pizza or large plate - would be very cheap. 

The idea would be that this way I'd use less power for smaller dishes, but I wonder if I'm just misunderstanding physics. 

A toaster oven usually has around 1500W worth of heating elements. I don't usually run the Matalskare at its full top-and-bottom 2650W setting, rather I prefer to use the fan element which runs at 1800W while still heating uniformly (I'd use less power with just one of the top or bottom elements, but then the food would get more heat on one side). So watt by watt I'm not really saving very much - but then you can't really make such a linear comparison, because the heaters aren't on all the time; once the set temperature is reached they're switched off until needed again.

I'm thinking a small oven has less air within itself to heat and significantly smaller metallic surfaces through which to disperse heat to the rest of the kitchen. In theory, would this not make for more efficient use of those 1500W?

---

To make a long question short, what I'm wondering if within the limits of common household units (that is, without considering professional or industrial ones) an oven is an oven is an oven, or if it makes any sense to size the oven according to what you need to cook; basically if it makes sense to acquire a smaller one to cook smaller dishes, or if the big oven would use about the same amount of power to achieve the same result and I'm worrying over nothing.",AskEngineers,False,IronMew,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fwpviv/does_it_make_sense_to_own_a_small_electric_oven/

63,How do I resolve battery voltage-current-state of charge calculations with calculations coming from a propeller and motor?,1586278661," 

I'm working on an electrically-powered propeller, and I've gotten myself wrapped around the axle trying to resolve a possible over-constraint.

So, I have this propeller (I know it's performance from CT, CP charts) that is fixed pitch. So, for a given RPM &amp; velocity, there is a single value of torque on the propeller.  
Now, knowing RPM and torque of the propeller (and thus the motor), I can calculate the voltage and current of the motor using the 4-constants set of equations.

However, and this is where I'm getting confused, batteries have a specific voltage based on the applied current (or a specific current based on its voltage). I'd get this data from a Voltage vs. state of charge &amp; current chart for a given battery. But, the voltage and current are being calculated already from the motor performance. Thus, is seems like there's a mismatch: current and voltage are potentially 2 different values calculated from 2 different sources.

So, I'm getting wrapped around the axle and have no idea how to resolve this apparent over-constraint of the problem.

We currently defined the system with 3/4 Inch tubing, solely on assumptions. I would like to calculate if that is big enough.

Technical details I can provide:

\- Max feed flow 2.7 kg/min

\- Temperature range 50 - 110 degrees Celsius

\- Pressure range 1 - 6.2 Bar

\- Gas feed mixture is mostly humidified air (0.02 g H2O per g of air) with low percentages of VOC liquids and diluted Ozone.

\- Length of tubing is to be determined, if important for the calculation please let me know or give me an example with, lets say 2 meters of length.

78,Project Help. Anti-Knock Tone Arm.,1586263212,"Hi everyone. I'm relatively new in the engineering world and currently doing an NVQ L3 in engineering principles.  Part of my course is to design a new product or create an enhancement or upgrade for an existing product.   

One of my favorite hobbies is to mix vinyl on a pair of turntables, the biggest issues I face when doing this is accidentally knocking the tone arm across the face of the vinyl when mixing two records together. This action causes the needle to run across the face of the vinyl causing irreparable damage to both the needle and vinyl.

My idea is to come up with an anti-knock device or mechanism that can prevent this action from happening. The main concept of my idea is a mechanism that reacts to sudden movement from the tone arm and prevents the needle from scratching the vinyl.  

One solution I came up with is a device/sensor in the tone arm that when subjected to abrupt movement, sends a signal to a mechanism which then instantaneously lifts the tone arm and needle up above the vinyl to prevent any contact that could scratch it. It is crucial the anti-knock device does not hinder the tone arms ability to smoothly move through the vinyl grooves and should only react when sudden and firm movement has been registered. 

Does anyone know of a sensor that reacts to sudden movement and could send a signal to a mechanism that could perform this action?

I'm currently deciding between the universities listed above for graduate school. For Northwestern, UCD, UCSD, and UW, I've been accepted into the MS for MechEng programs. For Boston University I've been accepted to the MS in Systems Engineering and MS in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. My goal for grad school is to develop some research experience by writing a thesis and applying what I learn at a robotics startup or at one of the tech giants.

My main goal in the future is to work with intelligent robotics in an R&amp;D department in the industry. I have no doubt that each of the programs will prepare me well, but I'm having a hard time picking one program to attend.

Here are some of my thoughts on the schools...

Boston University has a great new Robotics and Autonomous Systems program, but they're rankings overall are lower than the other schools I got into. In terms of fit, I think that that the program really matches what I want to do. Their Systems Engineering program would allow me to more traditional control theory, but I want to be able to take Machine Learning and apply it to robotics.

Northwestern is a great school overall and two of their professors do research that really reflects what I want to dive into. Data-driven controls and smart prosthetics.

Any of the UC's are well known and Davis is no exception. It's just to me, everything feels mediocre... One of my professors really enjoyed attending UCSD, but the requirement to take 3 courses in 2 concentrations just doesn't make sense to me... The breadth is too wide and I think an MS program needs to dive deep into a topic.

Uni of Washington has really great ties with Boeing and Amazon, but their MS program takes 2+ years to finish. Other than that, their research kinda matches what I want to do.

9,How do I communicate to my team that mechanical engineering isn't a quick and simple task?,1586211273,"Hi, I work for a small start-up company working on some very interesting stuff in the field of air and space. There's about 8 people not including the board and operations/HR. I'm the only mechanical engineer, and work on air, space and ground equipment, so the job couldn't be broader. There's also an electrical/electronics engineer, controls guy, physics guy, project manager. I expected that the tasks would be challenging when I took the job. I expected that I'd need to put in long hours. My concern is not the workload; it's that what is expected of me is off by an order of magnitude or more. 

There is a detailed design review in less than 6 weeks, for a mechanical assembly. There are a few challenges; 

- It needs to perform better and be lighter and perform in a harsher environment than the best available COTS items. 

- It's got to also hold dozens of electronic and electrical components whose interfaces are not defined. 

- They want it designed, manufactured and tested in the next four months (from blank slate). It seems they already decided on a material and a geometry before I got here; the problem is that they are set on building it out of a shit material, and a concept geometry they have their hearts set on is ridiculous, and the interface to the platform is undefined. 

- They want it mounted unconventionally to an airborne platform, in a way which I can find has never been demonstrated, and have already decided it will be a cakewalk to do.

The task isn't impossible, but when I told them that a regular company would have a team, and probably 6 months to a year to develop this, and a different concept, my comments were dismissed, e.g. ""It's only a..."", ""it's not as complicated as a ..."". And repeatedly ""it's just a development model, not a production model"".

It's precisely as if their vague opinions or ideas or cigarette packet drawings have as much weight as my analysis. Yet I have to constantly introduce terms like 'fatigue', 'strain', 'FMEA', 'modal analysis' and 'structural rigidity'.

The funniest part is a plan for the mechanical design, CAD and analysis of a space structure to take 1 week, and the mechanical design, CAD and analysis for an airborne structure to take the following week. I want half a year, not 2 weeks.

How do I effectively show that I know what I'm doing; communicate that the system will take longer than they have planned, and the system will need to be much different to what they envisaged?",AskEngineers,False,_Kinematic_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fw88bl/how_do_i_communicate_to_my_team_that_mechanical/

20,Should I Do Robotics Masters at Michigan?,1586203692,"Hi everyone! I have just been admitted to the MS Robotics program at the University of Michigan. However, I am finding it difficult to decide whether or not to attend the program in the Fall mainly because of the significant cost. 

For background, I am just finishing up my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from a smaller university in Canada. 

I plan on completing robotics masters at michigan in the 3 semester minimum which will cost about $75000 USD (25000 per semester). But not only the tuition cost, I have been also trying to consider the opportunity cost of not working for that year, which will probably be closer to $125000 (75000 tuition + 50000 working for a year maybe?) There are opportunities in the second year to get paid research positions, so I may stay longer than 3 semesters if I receive that funding for tuition. However, I have received mixed responses from past students about availability of funding so it’s seems like a 50/50 shot at getting that financial help.

I see an MS as simply a path to a better career in robotics, and do not plan on doing a PHD at this point. I really do love robotics and working on robotics projects, and have specific interests in computer vision, perception. I have spent almost  2 years now through multiple internships during my undergraduate degree working on robotics related projects and really don’t doubt my interest in the field. 

I have started looking at some jobs over the last couple months that I have been interested in and most of them would like or require a masters of some kind. However, there are also plenty of general software/elec jobs for robotics companies/projects that I think would also like. My undergraduate degree has not given me much experience in the robotics field and I think Michigan would be a really big step up and would also provide and lot of connections in the field as well as sort of start my transition to the US where there is a lot more opportunity.

I was hoping I would be able to decide if I was doing my masters after weighting the current job market but it turns out I will have to make the decision of whether or not I am doing a masters long before I will be able to start applying for jobs starting September this year. I have also considered maybe working for a bit beforehand but also don’t want to throw out my acceptance to the program when there is no guarantee I will get in next year. 

For anyone who may have an opinion or extra information on this subject, maybe gone through  something similar, think it is/ is not worth the investment, or any other advice you may have and can share that, that would be great.

21,Is this structure possible and sensible?,1586203597,"First things first - no way am I planning to try any of this in anger without consulting professionals. I know everything has to be checked by a structural engineer.

My rear garden is stepped and has some retaining walls. I don't like it very much and have been thinking about building one big retaining wall and levelling the garden off.

This morning I had an idea - level the garden to its lowest point, put some foundations in and then build some supporting walls to hold up a garden giving me space below.

I think the best way to realise this is using steel I beams to hold up the roof. The roof would be flat and contain an alcove deep enough for soil for grass to grow on.

I did a rough drawing and some calcs that may or may not be helpful

https://imgur.com/p7JkHRK

The top of the garden is about 3m higher than the bottom. The floor level doesn't have to be 3m it could be a little lower if that is more practical.

On another note, if that idea is nonesense, could I put up a retaining wall but lower the strength requirements if I put a cavity in to reduce the amount of earth, thus lateral forces?

1. Grad School. PROS: The Dean sent an email that the GRE will be waived because of the current pandemic so no issue with applying. I could obtain a masters degree but wont particularly have any more experience so not sure how much it will help. CONS: Money. I am confident that my parents would help me pay for tuition but I really wanted to start working and have my company pay/subsidize the cost. 
2. Go into HVAC trade. My brother is a master HVAC technician and I called him to tell him about losing my full time offer and discussed working on his crew. He's confident he could get me hired even if it's just a tool runner. PROS: Would have a paycheck (even if it's not a engineer check). I could get great technical experience in HVAC which could help get me into a HVAC engineer position. CONS: Will not be engineering experience. I will probably make less than what I made at my internship. 
3. I have a friend working a O&amp;M (Operation and Management) role at utility scale solar energy firm that could possibly get me a job. I am very weary of this option because there is a high possibility I get stuck in O&amp;M and never get back to engineering. PROS: Decent hourly pay. With about 10 hours overtime, 50/week, I could reach an equivalent engineer salary. CONS: I don't, personally, see a pathway to get back into engineering from this position. I didn't get my engineering degree to work operations.

45,Li-Ion Battery Resources for Academic Project,1586184765,"Good day ladies and gentlemen, a little context to start: I'm currently enrolled in an engineering program which offers a 5 year co-op degree, wherein every second semester after your first year the student has potential to work for a business in the industry of their discipline (if they can find an internship). To make it a bit more of an academic exercise, rather than being a glorified assistant, each ""work term"" requires a technical report for the first three placements, and a presentation to a board of faculty for any subsequent internship. The idea is that you need to work on an actual engineering project, and then you write your report based on that. This semester is my last technical report, and the COVID situation has made it somewhat more difficult. I spent the first three months doing revision control, bulk requisitions, as-building, basic CAD work, etc. but nothing academically rigorous with the expectation that the last month would be more focused on a specific project. The COVID situation first forced me to work from home, though I could still begin the project, but now I am out of a position entirely and have been unable to work on the project at all. I've discussed this with my coordinator, and am allowed to complete the project as though I were making a recommendation without actually having completed the project. However, I'm now bereft of resources.

&amp;nbsp;

This leads me to the crux of my inquiry: The project concerns a cost-benefit analysis of replacing a currently installed battery system with lithium ion battery system. Largely I've completed much of the cost analysis, though I need to expand on the growth of the technology and its benefits compared to lead-acid battery technologies. The thing is, I know virtually nothing about lead-acid batteries, Li-Ion batteries, just batteries in general. I've got a few white papers and a book I'm working my way through, but I'm usually around 30+ references which arise given complications and issues with the project.

&amp;nbsp;

So I figured I would come to you engineers, as a future prospective engineer, looking for your input on potential resources and directions to take this report. I'm thinking of discussing the chemistry behind lead-acid batteries, charging and discharging states, li-ion chemistry, charging and discharging states, safety concerns with hydrogen discharge (including the concept of a thermal runway), maintenance and monitoring systems, finishing with economic analysis.

tl;dr What resources would you recommend for someone studying lithium-ion batteries, and what sections would you expect to see in an academic report from a student on the subject?

This seems really dramatic but this has been an issue I've been dealing with internally for a while now. Keep in mind that I'm 25 and have only been an engineer for a year and this is my first engineering position ever, no internships or anything. 

I just received an email from my boss about how frustrated he is with how several of my previous projects were going, and he felt like I wasn't listening to him and dragging my feet with stuff and trying to cut corners. Truth is, I'm just not a super detail oriented person. I know this, and know that if i just fly by the seat of my pants, stuff gets missed, I forget things, and I'm not as thorough as I should be. Fair. It's something that I've known for a while and have been working on a LOT. I have 2 redundant checklists I keep updated with things to do, and a 3rd generated by our ERP software. I put a lot of effort into trying to make sure I'm on top of things, but i still have a long way to go. Learning to be Type A as an extremely disorganized person has been super hard. 

The truth is, though, a lot of this is because I feel a ton of pressure from sales and the C Suite to speed through projects if they are behind, and they're always behind. I'm in controls, so I'm the last person to see it before it goes out the door and all the slowdowns up to that point get compounded onto my shoulders. I don't get the time to do stuff right before the ship date, stuff gets missed, you know the drill. 

How do I talk to my boss about this? I feel like I can't win. If i take my time and do it right, I piss off the customer and the bean counters because it goes out late. If i speed through it, the customer and my boss get pissed because now its a buggy mess we have to spent weeks supporting. Either way, I get thrown under the bus. but I recognize that I do have issues I'm working on addressing. Has anyone else dealt with similar situations?

70,Engineering discipline choice: Biochemical vs Geological (seeking guidance),1586142340,"Hi, I am a first year studying engineering. First year at my university has been general, such that you can pick any engineering discipline after completion of first year. Before starting uni, I was deeply considering chemical engineering. In first year we took a course about geological engineering, and I really enjoyed it. I have always loved the outdoors, space, and nature, (seen the Grand Canyon and am still fascinated by it) so I really enjoyed the course. 

I hope to work in a field where the environment is considered to be very important as I have a passion for this as well. The two programs offer a great deal of relevant courses, however they are quite different. The chemical engineering variant is biochemical, with the option to specialize in bioenvironmental engineering as well. This variant offers a lot of electives to choose from, including some from other disciplines (have always been into aerospace as well, this allows me to take a few aerospace related courses). 

Geo would offer less multi-disciplinary technical electives, however I feel that I would enjoy geo as much as biochem since there is a great chance of working outside, plus the courses sound very interesting as well. The reason I would want to do biochem would be that I love chem labs, am good at chem naturally, and wish to help people (can still do in geo, but if I take the biochem route this could lead to Pharma or medical related fields), and am good at bio as well. I don't think I wish to work in the oil industry, so I am not sure of whether chem would be a good fit, however it is a very employable degree.

I am worried by choosing that I might make a mistake and regret not picking the other. I also wonder if there is the opportunity to work in a related job between the two, or work with other engineers who are specialized in the other discipline, depending which one is chosen. 

If you have the time, I would love to hear about any experiences from both, as well as your own paths taken and job prospects.

Hi,

Just wondering, should I commit suicide over a poor GPA (2.629 out of 4 or 4.601 on a scale of 7) given the COVID-19 crisis and impending economic depression. As it stands, I already struggle to get an internship (needed in my university to graduate) and I can't see it getting any easier. I feel like I failed as an engineering student and as a human being. I chose engineering as I was really good at STEM in my high school (Percentile called an ATAR of 91.45) and also hold a great interest in the field, having attempted to join a student project which has since been cancelled. The salary is also quite appealing too.

In terms of co-cirriculars, I was a member of a rocketry competition but that was cancelled due to COVID-19. So I don't really have anything to distinguish myself from my peers in that front.

84,A question about the future of my career.,1586123409,"Hi everyone. I graduated as both a mechanical and aerospace engineer in December 2019 from a state university with a decent 3.0&gt;GPA. I have behind my belt at least 2.5 years of experience, with 1 of those being engineering related and the rest just college employment. 

As many here, I’ve applied to hundreds of positions that fit my qualifications, skills and level. I’ve also attended career fairs I had to drive 200+ miles to get to. Nothing has come out of this pursuit. 

The closest I got was an interview with a welding/mechatronic proprietary company in Ohio back in November, and feedback was great...but here’s the icing on my career cake; im NOT a US citizen/person. I studied in the US as a foreign national under visa. The company, naturally, rejected me after hearing about this. 

Now here’s another important piece of info, before some of you call me an evil job stealing immigrant, or bad hombre; as an international student you get the “chance” of working in the US for up to 3 years with a special work visa, with the company interested in you having to do absolutely nothing different about you in the hiring process. I’ve let each and every place I’ve applied to know this, yet every company seems incredibly afraid of taking in a foreign national. 

As it stands now, I’m 60 days of unemployment away for my visa (which you pay$400 USD to the DHS to file) to expire, and with NCOV-19 around I think I can kiss this opportunity goodbye. 

My career question here, with all that context now established is; should I go for a masters or head back home? 

Here’s the data I’ve got to work on the answer for that question: 

Masters: applied for the fall semester at the same university I did my Bsc on. If accepted (lmao) certainty on funding was 90% a few months ago. As of today, I don’t know. I’d get the chance of improving my GPA, getting an MS and looking for internships, then later coming back to where I am with an employment visa begging for a company to have mercy. 

Back home: Shall I return home, I’d work for 2-3 years to save up for a masters in Canada or Europe. The thing about refusing to coming back home mounts up into 2 reasons: 

Salaries: Mexican engineers get paid dirt. I can do exactly the same thing a quality engineer does in Kansas for the same company in Mexico, and I will be getting 1/10th of his salary. 

The nature of work: Mexican engineers don’t design, research or develop...those are my passions. Our engineers work in the production lines for foreign companies most of the time, and our suggestions for improvements/changes in designs are frowned upon and rejected as if we were some sort of “inferior” being. The work culture in the company reflects this. 

Verdict: If I go for a masters in the USA, I’m rendered useless in the Mexican work market as I’ll be “overqualified” and no company will want me, but I get to try again in the American job market...with more experience and higher up in the qualifications percentile. 

If I go back home, I’m wasting the investment I made on the work visa, will work for pennies on the dime, won’t work in anything I’m qualified to work in (design/testing/research) but I get the chance to get more experience and apply to masters opportunities in Canada or Europe, where permanence through academic merit has a higher chance of working for foreigners. 

I know this is long and tedious as hell, thank you if you got this far in the read. I’m open to your suggestions, or perspective as from mine I remain STUCK on the verdict for both options.

Edit: I know working in aerospace is impossible unless I was some sort of modern day, Von Braun.

If so, then why does steel that's connected to an electrical system's ground rust?  Wouldn't the grounding end up disturbing whatever the electrical potential is?

Followup: If a hunk of underground steel is hooked to an electrical system's ground, does that make the sacrificial anode not work anymore?",AskEngineers,False,zimm0who0net,/r/AskEngineers/comments/fvlfoc/will_electrically_grounded_steel_rust/

-M.Eng (10 courses and I receive my masters in engineering). Work would pay for half so it would cost me approximately $5000.
-M.Sc (longer than M.Eng, I'd have to find a supervisor and research project) Cost would be covered through research funding.
-MBA: I love the idea of learning about business and developing that knowledge, however, I find it hard to justify a +$50k tuition for this program and can't see it as a significant ROI (work would not cover any of this)

I am working on making a bottle cap for a wine glass bottle, and for the cap, it is going to be ABS polymer.

30,Struggling to pick between current jobbed new job offer. Please provide input.,1586046460,"Hi All,

This might be a lengthy post but please read, I am requesting advice. I am a recent engineering college grad. I started my first job in September working as a software compliance engineer. While working though I did not plan on leaving anytime soon I was applying to jobs just to test the waters. A couple months ago I was offered a Solution Engineering position at Oracle. Now I am just very confused on what I should do. At the moment I am more inclined to picking Oracle bc I feel overall there are a lot more resources for me there though the company I am in right is a fairly big company too (no where as big as Oracle though). The other problem is Oracle is massive and I have heard mixed reviews of people who have worked there and though the company I am in right now is not the best, its not bad. The biggest concern for me at the moment is the pay. As I mentioned I am a recent grad (22 years old), currently at the company I am in I make a base salary of $70k/year (no bonuses or extra pay). At Oracle I would receive a sign on bonus of $2k, base salary of $60k, and up to $15k in bonuses a year (you will most likely not see all this but from current employees with this role they do see around on average $8-$10k of this a year). So currently yearly salaries would be similar with the exception one comes in a base and the other base and bonuses. For my current company I will not be getting a raise until April 2021 (not sure the exact amount but I suppose roughly 5%) and for Oracle I would not be getting a raise until July 2021 and my salary will become base $70k and $30k bonuses ( again you will not see $30k but will see at least $10-15k, this info was told tom me by a current second year in the position I am hired for). Now that you know the details what do you guys recommend I do? Should I take a smaller base and start over though I will likely make the same overall? What would be better in the long run?  Should I leave current company though upon leaving would have only have been there 10 months? Does this look bad? Please provide input.

60,(Help needed) COVID Face-shield Injection Molding. Can this design be injection molded?,1586011861,"I'm looking for help from people experienced in injection molding to give feedback on a design for face-shield brackets.

[https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013359](https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013359) 

We've added slots to the sides that allow the transparency to slot in on the sides and updated the pegs for the transparency so they work with a standard 3-hole punch and an 8.5x11 transparency. This adds rigidity without the need for a bottom brace and helps to keep the mask tight to the face.  


The design has been re-drawn from scratch to allow for 2-degree draft angles on most surfaces.

The design is intended to be molded with the molds meeting along the parting lines shown in this image:

Do Engineers compute structures considering also how a construction will age?,1586005101,"Also I studied computer engineering, I know only superficially about civil engineering (although I informed myself about an optional courses for static structures, due to the math involved).

Lately I was asking myself a question I should have asked long ago: ok we have those ""old"" buildings (buildings with 30+ years of age), how do we know that we can be pretty sure they aren't going to collapse in the next months?

I mean, they are going to collapse one day, but how can we be sure that ""oh, this building doesn't need any check for the next 10 years, it is safe"".

I know, one could say ""look, people for long time built like this, and things didn't collapse, thus for similarily you can expect that those buildings won't collapse as well"", but to me it sounds risky as every construction differs from the others.

Therefore I started to presume that in the computation done in a building, engineers considers also parameters about how the building will age to be sure that it will last for decades.

Is that so? If not, how do engineers know that the building will last decades? (if not a building, a bridge and so on). Do periodical checks exist on buildings, to ensure that we ""know"" that they aren't going to collapse, although partially?

To me it seems marvelous how some buildings just are there as if nothing happens, if one considers how many different factors can affect the structure of a building: people living in the building producing vibrations of different magnitude (someone hammering here and there, or drilling, or forniture falling, or people dancing and so forth);  weights that get moved (forniture for example); the weather, having water getting in that may comprimise the walls or the pillars or too strong winds; renovation works that may stress the building structure; neglected parts were plants can grow and thus the root may help the water go in in the structure, animals drilling here and there (insects), and so on.",AskEngineers,False,pier4r,/r/AskEngineers/comments/futa9j/civil_engineering_do_engineers_compute_structures/

73,"Strain energy, fracture, impulse loading and examining this in FEA",1585987755,"Mechanical engineering student, but this isn't a question related to any university work. So I assume it's still appropriate to ask it here.

I'm a shooter and given an interest in engineering, I tried to design a bolt action rifle a few years ago. I decided to basically copy the AR15's locking design given it's proven. I used almost the same dimensions (but rounded to metric units) and the same materials properties, but the FEA showed it was a no go with peak stresses in the range of 2000-3000MPa using the maximum pressure and base diameter of a 5.56mm Nato cartridge. The alloys used were Carpenter 158 (milspec) and 9130 (used in most non-milspec modern guns, actually the better choice given materials advances since the 1950s) which have yield strengths of about 950MPa and 1100MPa respectively, so you know, strong stuff but nowhere near enough.

So I went back and filleted out stress concentration areas to some ridiculous degrees, but that still only brought the maximum stresses down to slightly below 2000MPa. I then went back to the drawings I had of AR15 bolts and performed the FEA on them as well. 

Now, I didn't draw these up myself having found them online, but multiple people have done this and have come back with very close dimensions, so I trust the dimensions are reasonably correct, but they also failed with peak stresses in the 2000-3000MPa range again. This doesn't make much sense given that there are 20 odd million AR15/M16 type rifles in existence and they clearly aren't exploding every time they are used. So I was clearly doing something wrong here.

I gave up and moved on at this point but I'm now coming back to this with more knowledge. I learnt about strain energy in Engineering Materials (3rd year topic at my uni) last year. Obviously I knew about the concept long before then in the form of springs but we examined it more seriously and I suspect this is the answer.

Essentially, the peak pressure might be 430MPa (62,000psi) with a base diameter of 9.58mm and a bolt force of 31kN, but this is peak pressure and only lasts a tiny fraction of a second. Using QuickLOAD (a piece of internal ballistics software used by handloaders to develop loads for ammunition, it's well regarded and backed by testing) I found the chamber pressure is only above 250MPa for 0.3ms and only above 150MPa for 0.47ms. At 150MPa your maximum stress is essentially below the yield point of the material.

So we come to strain energy. In short, exceed the amount of strain energy per unit volume in a material and it permanently deforms, add more energy and it fractures, but that energy needs to be transferred into the material, so we come back to good old work=force*distance.

You pull the trigger and the pressure inside the chamber goes from zero to 430MPa in 0.3 miliseconds. The bolt then moves back under this huge force, the locking lugs bending like springs and absorbing that energy per the equation for work. This takes time, the recoil delayed by the force the springs (the locking lugs) are exerting and also must overcome the momentum of the bolt. But before the bolt can absorb enough energy to permanently deform and then fracture, the pressure drops, and as springs the lugs return to their original shape.

So my question is does this sound correct? Is my understanding of why you can (in this case) exceed yield stress in the ""standard"" understanding of fracture and deformation without failure correct?

We did examine strain energy and failure in Engineering Materials, but it wasn't in the case of rapid impulse loading of bodies. There is also a section in the textbook that goes into more detail about strain energy but we didn't cover that chapter. There is also another section on impact loading but it doesn't seem applicable. So if you know a good textbook to research this I'd like to hear.

If I am correct, how should I go about analysing this in FEA? I've been using Inventor's built in FEA software but I don't see any options that would easily examine this. I must assume that there is software out there that does it. Someone must be examining this sort of thing even if it has nothing to do with firearms (water hammer in pipes immediately comes to mind).

There is one paper I found that actually discusses failure of M16 bolts but I completely disagree with their methodology. They halved the maximum pressure because they believed that recoiling of the bolt during firing as ""pressure in the cartridge after combustion is dissipated by the rearward motion of the bolt"", which is complete nonsense as the volume change needed to reduce pressure by an significant amount is huge. They only way it could be done is after the bolt unlocks after firing, which only happens after pressure levels have dropped enough that the cartridge casing won't explode or the gun won't vent high pressure hot gases into the user's face, long after the maximum pressure of 430MPa is reached. It also ignores the many ""bolt-action"" AR15s (guns with gas systems removed so they must be cycled manually after each shot) that exist in countries where AR15s are illegal. But then again, I haven't published any papers.

The paper is here if you want to read it: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/566b/1271350753d0655493ae05820f84258e20ed.pdf

I was at a startup before this that I was looking to leave as my salary was pretty much capped and I was aggressively recruited by as a contractor for one of the biggest biotechs in the Bay. Originally, I was to meet the whole team, but after the first interview they sent me an offer, and it was 50k more than I was making so I took it right away.

At my previous role I was very much a generalist as it was me and only my boss as the sole engineers, so I was doing full stack apps, devops, data engineering, and data science.

\&gt;I sent out the documentation for the project to everyone... oh you need to authenticate to this specific system to get access. Oh to authenticate to this system you need permissions from this other system first.

Multiple times there have been requests  for me to do something, only to find out that the task was done months or years ago by another team member. I like to take the initiative and jump on projects, but because I have no real idea what exists yet, I’ve been hoping for others to pretty much tell me what they need help on.  I’ve stated “I’m more than happy to work on whatever is needed, or leftover”. Most meetings end with indecision. I’m not really sure how else to approach this and would love feedback on how to better get involved with the team.

I’ve also never worked on a large team of engineers, so I'm sure I could improve here. I know the ins and outs of Jira, but my previous company was so small you could just talk to people, which was great. Here it seems very Jira heavy, and anytime I ask questions like

\&gt;If I were to create an API/CLI for dynamic S3 bucket generation, how would you get access keys and secret keys? Would it be preferred to assume roles?”

as a separate manager had asked me to do this yesterday (which was great, as it was the first time I’ve spoken with someone who gave me an explicit task to do). I was ignored, and then in a separate meeting found out an entire system already exists for this more or less.

There are also relatively complicated chains to do anything, as you have specific people managing each set of systems.  Everything is extremely documentation heavy, and the chain of command for approval is still beyond me. Unfortunately, I’m still unaware who many of those people are, and for those I’ve met, they all seem reluctant to include me in anything they are working on.

We also have daily checkin meetings where it’s literally “Hi so and so what are you working on today?” Is this normal? Like how much can anyone reasonably do in a day where it requires a check in? In general, I sense disappointment from everyone, but I feel like I’ve technically only been working 6 days (since I’ve had a laptop to access the systems)!

I should mention that I found out that there is no overtime, and if you do work overtime you can “take time off (unpaid) to reflect the hours you worked”, which honestly took the incentive away from me to work more than 40 hours. (as a previous FTE I would work 70+ hours on occasion).

Finally, a lot of the systems have a funny code smell. Most of the people on my team are at least in their late 30s so maybe it's my junior ignorance... but some systems and implementations just don't make sense or seem poorly planned.

I should also mention this has also happened to a friend of mine who's in the CS industry. In his case it seemed like the recruiter skimmed his resume and chose to ignore his 7+ years of experience in X field and sent him a rejection letter that cited his lack of experience in X field. He chose to reply to the recruiter and asked her to reconsider because he felt as if his resume had not even been read. In this case, my friend, who also had contacts at the company, found out that his reply to the rejection letter was viewed poorly by recruiters, effectively removing his chances at getting any position there.

I know from observation that 1/2 (might have been 3/4, I need to watch that video again) of fiberglass can stop multiple shots of 0-0 buckshot, slugs, and 9mm. Knowing that fiberglass has those properties, would ceramic refractory wool be as performant if compressed and epoxied? used as small plates, sewn into the padding?

Would 1/4"" of 504 stainless AND 1/4"" of fiberglass conceivably be as performant as the aforementioned fiberglass test.

I can epoxy impregnate leather, Would that be a comparable material to an epoxied synthetic fiber?

95,Need help calculating desk sag,1585942401,"I have a desk that consists of [this tabletop (the 98 inch version)](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/karlby-countertop-walnut-veneer-70335212/) and 2 of [these drawers](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-white-10192824/) on each end. Furthermore i placed 2 feet (see the picture below) inbetween.

I've had the desk for 3 years now and i think there's a visible amount of sag already. I'm not sure if i should strengthen the tabletop with metal bars or not to prevent it from bending.

I'd appreciate it if anyone could calculate the amount of sag (in cm/mm/whatever) that i can potentially get. I passed statics&amp;dynamics and materials classes but that was a while ago. Not sure what the tabletop is made of on the inside. Don't think it's massive wood that's for sure.

96,Advise Needed: Not enjoying my work as a digital design engineer and feeling lost,1585940846,"Hi Everyone, 

I recently graduated as an electrical engineer with specialization in power systems and microelectronics - and enjoyed both areas of study equally. I'm currently working with a well-known company as a digital design engineer but I don't feel happy/satisfied with work. I don't enjoy the work (mostly verification stuff although I'm design engineer) and it seems to drain me a little more everyday.

Just a little background, I had a chance to work in power systems industry as system planning intern and really enjoyed the work there (a great balance of desk work, visiting sites and meeting with customers). Unfortunately, when I graduated last year there were not enough opportunities in power systems hence, I went into to explore semi-conductor industry instead and it is a total different world - at least from the perspective of my role. My work involves sitting all day, writing and debugging code, making it hard to keep myself motivated. Although, I have received great feedback on all my evaluations so far, I guess this role just doesn't fit my overall personality.   


I would really appreciate an advise on this matter.
