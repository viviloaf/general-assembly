10,"I'm very concerned that I'm not smart enough to get into Robotics/Automation engineering, but I also don't want to settle.",1547979025,"Hello all, thanks for taking the time to offer advices on my situation.

Little bit of background about me, I'm a recent EE grad with overall below average grades, though my grades are somewhat polarized. There are terms in high 3s and terms in low 2s mostly, and it its mostly due to me being clinically depressed for the majority of Uni life. Despite all that I was lucky enough to have 18 months of coop experience in very respectable power companies, and was elected EE team lead for a year, and then elected project manager for another year at uni's robotics club before I graduated. (The team goes to a yearly competition that can get fairly competitive, though our team only gets OK rankings and results). I am a very hands-on guy, and is willing to get super dedicated and no-life to achieve a goal, but was always slow at understanding knowledge.

The 2 years in robotics club really got my attention as it is way cooler than the power engineering stuff i did during past internships. However, while I was looking through the job postings of many robotic/automation companies, I am only aligned with about \~40% of their criteria. I might be able to close that gap by a little bit though the Udacity robotics course that I plan to do and some self learning, but the high standards that this industry asks still feels out of reach to me. I am already 26(wasted few years here and there) unlike 99% of the undergraduates out there and I cannot afford to wonder around anymore. There are a lot more realistic stuff I need to start to take into consideration. 

It would be somewhat easier to get a job as a electrical designer or similar in either distribution or transmission probably, since most of my work experience align, but knowing there are fields which I am far more interested in kills me on the inside. I just feel that working in the robotics/automation industry gives me a lot more personal significance and sense of accomplishment, even if this is purely my naivety speaking.

Do I just settle and not think about it anymore? I am too afraid that I will end up resenting myself for not trying. To me this is akin to accepting mediocrity (and i know this is a personal issue that I need to work on lol) Do I go hardcore on trying to land a job in robotics/automation? I can certainly get a job somewhere while looking for it. The temp job doesn't even need to be engineering related and I can do the hard grind in the meanwhile. But how long can I last before I submit to the cruel reality? My GF(who's also a EE) has been working(not in robotics/automation) for a year already and feeling to continue live off her sucks. She was talking about getting married and such in a year or two as well goddammit. I'd be even more devastated if I had tried and not able to make it into this field. Time would be wasted too.

I apologize if it sounds more like a rant rather than description. What's your opinion on this?

Anyway.

The senior engineer routinely comes to me, and asks me about basic Python questions, and object-oriented programming questions, and I always try to help them make their code more pragmatic during our code review sessions.

97,Looking for a specific type of retaining ring,1547823849,"How do you do, fellow engineers? Wondering if someone has come across this specific part I need in their work or play. 

My car has two exhaust pipes. One of the pipes has a butterfly valve on it that closes at low RPM to make the engine sound a little quieter. Here’s a pic: https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/3bQAAOSwUYNaQ-kE/s-l1600.jpg 
The shaft of the valve has a spring that wraps around it to apply pressure axially between the actuator arm and the outer edge of the exhaust pipe to prevent rattling. I am not sure if the previous owner added this spring as I can’t find a good picture of it online. 

Unfortunately, in their infinite wisdom, BMW designed this butterfly valve without longevity in mind. It rattles like a metal garbage can full of nickels at cold start and low revs. I have tried disabling it entirely but it makes it sound like shit at low revs. The spring works its way up the shaft as the shaft rotates frequently; one of the ends of the spring always pops its way over the top of the actuator arm and reduces the compression of the spring, increasing rattle. I removed the spring and reformed it into a tighter circle but it happened again. 

There are aftermarket kits for this but they cost $140 and I am too stubborn and mechanically inclined to buy one yet. 

I want to pop a retaining ring with a small inner diameter (1/4in) with a rather large outer diameter (1/2-3/4in) around the top of the spring to prevent it popping over the top of the actuator arm. Does anyone know where I can find this? Googling “retaining ring with large flange” doesn’t get me a whole lot.

From my research I have not been able to find a sample consulting service agreement where it outlines the cost breakdown of a given project.

* CAD / pcb layout in cadence or altium
* ordering and assembling components
* testing using test equipment 

I would assume charging separate rates for the above four tasks is perfectly fine due to differences in complexity. For example, I would charge most for design/simulation (~ $200/hr). But for something simpler like assembling a test board I would charge ~ $100/hr. Would I then include a flat rate of $xxx.xx for parts in the consulting service agreement which I could mention *""subject to change""* due to not knowing what components I might need ahead of time?

1- I can have the receiver and transmitter on a single placed adjacent to each other, and place a reflective marker on the receiver and use image processing to find its coordinates.

2- I can do what the OPALS team did and have both incoming and outgoing signals in the same line of action througg clever use of optics. What they do is use an Off-Axis Parabola lens to focus the incoming signal onto a dichroic beam splitter, which sends the incoming signal to the receiver, but reflects the outgoing signal onto the Off-Axis Parabola Lens and out towards the twin device.

The trouble is, Off-Axis Parabola lenses are terribly expensive. Instead, I am hoping to use a Fresnel Lens in an otherwise nearly identical setup. 

Finally, my question is: can the outgoing beam travel through the 'wrong' side of the Fresnel Lens without being distorted?

26,Practical methods of damping vibrations in a 3D printer,1547768180,"I recently purchased a 3D printer (Ender 3) that I have been using with great success.  My prints are coming out way above what I was hoping from the printer but there is still some vibration (ringing/ghosting) in the prints.  It's nothing bad and is actually fairly difficult to spot, but I, personally, like to improve things to their maximum capability. So now I have an obsession with cutting down as much vibration in the printer as possible.  


From my browsing of the Internet on this topic, it seems that there are a few obvious solutions to reduce the vibration.  These are:  


\- To increase the mass of the printer, in this case by large paver stone base  
\- To stiffen the frame as much as possible

\- To place the printer on top of rubber pads

&amp;#x200B;

To this effect, I have placed my printer on an 18x18 paver stone, placed the whole set up then on a rubber mat and am waiting on 2020 aluminum extrusion gussets/corner brackets to stiffen the frame.  I'll also be adding Z frame bracing (basically a stiff rod connection from the top of the printer to the front or back edges, on both sides, to stiffen the upper portion of the printer frame).  But what else can I do?  


I've browsed through material and have some ideas, but I was asking here if there are any practical methods that could improve the vibration dampening even more.  Some of these ideas are:

&amp;#x200B;

\-To add another paver stone to further increase the mass

\-To bolt the printer to the stones to improve the connection between the two (unsure if I should take off the rubber feet so that there is more surface area touching between the printer and the stone)

\-Pour sand or lead shot (which would be better) into the frame of aluminum extrusions that would support it (mostly the vertical 2040 extrusions)

\-Apply some type of material to the frame itself for passive vibration damping/absorption (like archery limb dampers or just sorbothane; maybe even earplugs stuffed into the grooves with sorbothane covering them).  I used to play baseball and I remember we could add this rubber cap to the end of our bats that really killed that stinging vibration we felt in our hands on bad hits.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there an optimal layout for additional stones or mass?  I know that the order of armor on vehicles (soft and hard armors in a composite) can drastically change their kinetic and chemical resistance (beyond the thickness of the material) but is there something similar with vibration damping?  Should I separate two paver stones with sorbothane and then the whole structure from the table with some more sorbothane or should I keep the two stones together as one solid mass and put that structure on some sorbothane?  


With the motors themselves, they make stepper motor dampers, but they seem to introduce issues rather than solve them.  My understanding of this is how they are built, that they can introduce play in the belt movements during high torque/jerk moments.  But what about spacing (solidly) away from the frame?  Will a reduction in connecting surfaces reduce the transfer of vibration from the motors to the frame?  


For a point of reference, this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws1JfHl3Y0o&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws1JfHl3Y0o&amp;t=2s)  seems to indicate that most of the vibration the printers have is between 10-20 hz and 30-50hz.  


On the electronic side, I'm upgrading the stepper drivers and should be reducing a lot of the electrical noise they generate, as well as adding TL smoothers and incorporating an OS called klipper; which from my understanding utilizes some more advanced math than the standard boards (like Marlin) to account for things like this.  In practical use, klipper allows the same quality at much faster print speeds.  


All in all, I plan to use an app on my phone and a custom printed mount to check for any improvement/degradation from the ""solutions"" I incorporate, but I was hoping to take a good step forward before trial and error.",AskEngineers,False,Sgt_R0ck,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ah43ey/practical_methods_of_damping_vibrations_in_a_3d/

30,CAREER HELP: Am I an engineer? If so what type? Looking at Biomed/Civil maybe..,1547759114,"Hi everyone! I am a college sophomore trying to figure out what to do with my life. I am looking at engineering, but I just don't know what type of job will fulfill me! Some things about me:

Personality: I look at life as a learning experience. I often ask about the whats and whys of EVERYTHING. My mind is constantly thinking, constantly debating, and constantly imagining. Some people compare me to a five year old; I dream up impossible theories, machineries/systems, and possibilities. I will dedicate hours to particular projects or thoughts, but need to constantly be doing/thinking of something new. I'm a big picture thinker; I look at systems as a whole, not just one small detail. I'm fairly extroverted, but also kind of an alpha female. This is both good and bad, as I can be extremely expressive of my thoughts or opinions. I am often misunderstood by many which can lead to interpersonal conflict when working in groups because I seem to have an odd perspective often. Usually this resolves once people try to understand what I am saying. I'm an extremely visual thinker also. I make WEIRD connections with seemingly unrelated things, I will relate a biological system to something crazy like a political system and people look at me confused usually until I explain. its like my mind is constantly analyzing and making connections between all my classes. I HATE being micromanaged or bossed around; I need to be independent. Supposedly I'm an ENTP.

Classes taken: I have taken almost every intro science class my university offers. ENGINEERING DESIGN: LOVED it. Particularly the design part and learning how everything works!!! I did well in the class, I was not the one who was very hands on with the electrical stuff and actual putting together, but I was extremely resourceful, did all the computer designing and drawings, research, and write ups. I have several drawings of chocolate making machines, gantry system screwdrivers, water bottling systems, etc. I worked well with software like fusion 360, 2d to 3d image converters, etc. MATH: I love thinking of math theoretically (linear algebra and multi are my favorite because I visualized everything like CRAZY, I spent months trying to visualize the 4th dimension), doing the actual math can get a little tedious but I like problem solving in general. Physics is eh, I'm decent at it but it's not my favorite. Thinking of astrophysics theory is cool and stuff but also I feel like the physics goes above my head there. I have only taken physics one so maybe that is why. Chemistry was kind of interesting, I just cant visualize it very well which makes it difficult. Biology is super interesting, particularly cell bio. Psych is one of my favorites, both in a neuroscientific/ biological and social way because it combines so many subjects. I really like neuro stuff, but once again I don't know how detailed it will get when I add in more chemistry. I like the bigger picture and bio stuff tends to get stuck on small details. GEOLOGY: SO interesting, I love earthquake stuff especially and geophysics. COMSCI: unfortunately I just got into the class and have little experience with it. I think I will like it, but I'm scared I will get bored because I need to relate it to something on a philosophical level.

EXPERIENCES: I have worked with two civil engineers in my life. With one, we created a rain water cleaning system and made a mini model. With the second one, I shadowed her at her job and worked on multiple projects such as road drainage systems and airport platform building. I looked over all the designs, they were pretty cool. It was fun constantly working in the field, but also having some desk time. She herself did not do the designing part though. Other than that, I don't really know what an engineering job is like. 

My university doesn't offer engineering, but they offer a 2 year extended program for an engineering degree at another school on top of the major I'm getting here. I am majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics concentrating on biology and a minor in psych. I'm thinking of civil engineering or Biomedical Engineering, but I don't really know what a typical day would be like for that. 

I need a career where I will be learning, creating, visualizing, and moving. I don't like tedious detailed things, but I do like challenges. There always has to be something new. 

PLEASE HELP! Is engineering a career for me? If so what type? Or what type of things do y'all do that I might find interesting? Or just ANY insight on what an engineer's day is like.

57,Why aren't you working on your ideas?,1547695752,"A few days ago, I asked a question here, ""What's a realistic invention you wish someone would bring to market?""A link to it is [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/ag0045/whats_a_realistic_invention_you_wish_someone/) 

It got almost 400 comments and many great ideas. Yet, in my day job, I talk to a lot of engineers that have great ideas and spend zero time developing them. 

Is it because school teaches engineers to solve problems brought to them rather than developing their own? 

Is it the effort involved?

Is it the lack of knowing how to sell?

Why aren't more engineers taking leadership of ideas? Who else is going to do it?

To share, I've taken a couple shots, one was building something similar to Uber, but earlier. It stemmed from a friend's limo business, but I actually didn't come from a software background. I hacked a prototype together with some decent design and I had some meetings with big investors, but failed to get funding to continue. I didn't know how to sell and business plan and quite frankly wasn't ready to run a company, but I learned a lot. And not just about engineering. I also realized selling was my weakness compared to technical, so I got a hybrid role that allowed me to develop both.

A second idea was for an improvement in the energy generation arena. I put a lot of time, thought, calculations, and spreadsheet work into it, then found out that it didn't work mathematically, at least it wasn't the improvement I thought it would be for the cost, so I stopped. Again, it honed a different skill set.

Neither failure ended my life as it feels like it would. It was a lot of time spent, but it raised my skills and created things to talk about in interviews. It also showed what my strengths and weaknesses were. 

Even if you don't believe you have everything to bring something to market you could do like Elon Musk did with Hyperloop Alpha and write [a report](https://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha.pdf) which others run with. 

When I talk to engineers, they have big ideas. They want to contribute to the world, but are only comfortable sharing with those who will nod along, no questions asked. 

If you have ideas you want to take a shot with, and need a push of confidence to start or continue, feel free to share as much as comfortable here. This forum is a great mix of insight, inspiration, and helpfulness. I'll add value where I can, and other members will add far more than I can.

P.S. As I get older, I realize I enjoy helping others even more than building stuff. Thanks for reading, I look forward to what you share.

61,Why do wheels reach constant velocity under constant fuel supply?,1547687073,"Lets say you have an engine in a garage attached to a wheel and a gas petal, nothing else and no car. If you press the petal to a certain position, the wheel will accelerate but eventually stop accelerating and reach a constant angular velocity. Why? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my analysis, Now lets say the piston  is in the up position attached to the crankshaft slightly off set so that as the piston goes down it will rotate the crankshaft counterclockwise. Now there is an initial explosion in the cylinder, I know it does not start like that but for the sake of this example it doesn't matter, Now with the down stroke the explosion constantly adds a torque to the crankshaft and accelerates its, after it has rotated pi, on the upstroke only the momentum continues the rotation and the friction causes it to slow down. So the wheel is accelerated during the down stroke due to the explosion and it slows down on the upstroke than it repeats. Increasing fuel will increase the frequency. From this I conclude that the constant angular velocity  is an illusion, the wheel is just accelerating/decelerating with such a high frequency it appears constant. Is this correct?

64,College Advice: Satellite Experience for a Space Exploration Career?,1547685041,"Hey everyone! I’ll try to make this as concise as possible:

I am currently a freshman dual majoring in aerospace / mechanical engineering. I am heavily involved in engineering clubs and projects, and I love everything I do.

I recently interviewed for a leadership position at my school’s UNP (University Nanosatellite Program) laboratory. I have not gotten the position yet, but if I do I will need to accept / deny it extremely quickly. Without giving unnecessary details, this is a highly prestigious club. Our proposal for a new mission was just cleared for Phase A, and this next year will be incredibly busy for everyone involved to make it to Phase B.

Here are some of the things that go along with that role: 15 hour work weeks minium (rare), and 80 hour work weeks during review periods, no pay; as a side note, they told me I most likely won’t be able to take any internships for the remainder of college because of the high density work that will be needed for the project, I will also most likely have to drop the majority of my other activities in order to make up for this huge commitment. On the other hand, this is one of the biggest opportunities to have on campus as an aerospace student, and the experience would be unparalleled.

If I am planning on working in the space exploration sector after college, how important will heavy satellite experience be? Is the density of the work worth it without pay? Is this position worth dropping some other (rocketry / engineering) clubs? Are internships more important?

I really want to take this, as I am super interested in the project. But I also want to plan to be as successful as possible in my future career, and I don’t know if this is worth the investment yet or not...

77,Simulating a QPSK demodulator,1547669625,"I have this assignment in which I have to simulate a communications system with python. We are asked to modulate a sequence of bits with QPSK (but the type of modulation is not really relevant to the question). Then the received signal has AWGN (noise) with known SNR and therefore known variance of the gaussian noise. 

The demodulator is supposed to multiply the received signal r(t) with a base function (sine or cosine, again that's not really relevant) and then integrate over a period. Because the simulation is digital and not analog, I thought that I should sample the signal r(t) and then take the average of the multiplication over a period instead of integrating. However when sampling rate increases the variance of the noise is less and hence error rate is smaller.

I guess that real receivers don't work like that so where am I wrong?  Maybe I have not understood correctly how the integrator works (is it less accurate than the simulation?).

I am currently a field artillery officer in the Army, and I am seeking advice to help me transition towards my goal of becoming a professional engineer.  I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech in May 2015, and have not done any engineering for 3 1/2 years.

Questions
1. What are my options to help me acquire a job? Started the Army’s Soldier-for-Life Transition Assistance Program.  Currently looking at internship opportunities and EIT license.

2. Is internship the best option?

3. What other options are there that I should look into? (certificates, co-ops, R&amp;D etc)

4. What are the best resources to study for the FE exam? I’m looking at multiple options for practice exams, study/reference books, and manuals: NCEES, PPI, Michael Lindeburg manual, 12-part EIT Academy Course on engineerintrainingexam.com, and YouTube.

5. How should I build my network? So far I’ve reached out to the Career Skills Program Manager in Fort Riley, one close friend who is a systems engineer at MITRE, one close friend who is a chief engineer at Amazon, and emailed Virginia Tech graduate and undergraduate advisors.

6. What are good companies to work for in the Aerospace and Defense industry? Currently looking at Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE Systems, Orbital ATK, United Technologies Corporation, The MITRE Corporation, CACI, and MTSI.

7. What kind of salary range should I expect as an entry level mechanical or systems engineer in the northern VA area?

8. What are the steps to acquire a TS/SCI (top secret clearance)?

9. What other advice can you give that I haven’t thought of?


Long-Term Plan: 5+ Years
My current career plan is to become a professional engineer in five years.  I am mostly interested in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.  My wife and I also plan to live northern VA since that’s where we grew up, where our family and friends are, we love the area, and the home of many VT alumni (she also graduated from VT).  The plan is to:
1. Acquire an internship
2. Pass the FE exam, acquire EIT license
3. Get a job
4. Acquire TS/SCI (top secret clearance)
5. After four years, take PE exam, acquire PE license
6. Keep working (?)
7. Acquire Master’s Degree (?)
8. Keep working or conduct engineering research (?)
9. Acquire Ph.D (?)
10. Become an industry researcher or college professor (?)
I put question marks next to the ones I am interested in, but unsure of or have not put much thought and research into.


Short-Term Plan: 2019-2020
I have an eight (8) year contract with the Army (4 years active, 4 years reserve).  I have been on active duty for three years, with one year left in my contract before I transition to IRR (individual ready reserve).  I plan to ETS (Expiration of Term of Service) January 2020, which is when I am released from active duty.  I am currently in Poland for my brigade’s rotation/deployment.  Current timeline:

1. Now-May2019: Poland rotation.  Study for FE exam.  Return to Fort Riley in mid/late May.

2. June2019: Soldier-for-Life Transition Assistance Program (SFL-TAP) at Riley.  I plan to start early June and capstone in three weeks.

3. July2019-October2019: Internship in Virginia and take the FE exam.  Battalion commander approved of my plan to do an internship back in northern VA for up to 4 months (I can start as early as July 5th, 2019) while still getting paid full time by the Army.

4. November2019: Clear from Fort Riley.  I’ve been told this only takes 10 days.

5. December2019: Terminal leave begins.  Hawaii trip, Christmas and New Years with family.

6. January2020: Move family to northern Virginia

7. February2020: Start engineering job

1,Oil dilution in TGDI engines and it’s long term effects on engine performance and durability,1547624514,"Hello all, I recently found out that my 1.5T earth dreams engine in my 2018 Honda Civic Hatchback EX has some major issues with fuel getting into the crankcase and diluting the oil. So far I am currently experiencing high oil levels and a very strong gas odor from the oil, as in I don’t smell oil at all, only pure gasoline. Anyway, I have done a lot of research on this and Honda’s explanations of dilution due to cold weather and short trips seems bogus to me and I was wondering if any of you had ideas on what would be causing this issue on such a large scale. Obviously there will be some blow by as well as some gas condensing on the cylinder walls is bound to happen during a cold start but the civics engine is on a whole other level. I have started only in temps above 40 degrees F and only take long trips and I still have the issue which is why I question Honda’s explanation. So I guess I have two questions: one is why do you think this is happening to such a serious degree in these engines and the second is how much you think the oil properties will be affected and how much premature wear should be expected? I have managed to find a few papers behind paywalls discussing this issue but I’m not really willing to shell out $30 for them at the moment so any input form you guys would be great!

8,Would love some career advice to get back into engineering,1547612361,"I feel so incredibly lost and would love some guidance on how i can get on a path that makes me feel less lost.

Bit of back story:

I graduated with a B.S. in aerospace engineering in 2013 and had trouble finding a job right out of school, i also didn't have any internships during my undergrad aside from a senior design class project where we were able to work out of a local aerospace company. But that ended and i lost contact with those people. Truthfully, I feel so dumb in not even realizing that it would have been a good idea to get more experience prior to leaving school, i don't feel like i was given great career guidance from my school and peers but i'm taking full responsibility for trying to fix this.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, i ended up working for a local subcontractor doing some CNC work that then lead to becoming an estimator for them. I tried a few times to leave early on and get an engineering job elsewhere but nothing ever came of it. I worked there for almost 4 years until 8 months ago when i found work with local GC becoming an assistant project manager. It's a great career path and has lots of room for growth. I hate the construction field though. I want out of it and dont know how. I'd love to get into aerospace again or even mechanical engineering consultant work. Anything that allows me to use some more engineering knowledge. I feel the path im on is what a business major typically goes into.

Hi all,

So as the title suggests I want to evenly spread sand onto a table. Specifically a shuffle table. If you don't know shuffle is a game a bit like curling where you slide metal pucks along a long and narrow table (~6x0.7m). 

The sand greatly reduces friction between the puck and the table, and can have an effect on direction, so it's important that the sand is spread evenly. Since people sit on either side of the table it is also necessary that the sand is not flicked out to the side of the table.

I love playing shuffle but re-sanding manually is a pain, so I have an idea to make a wheeled robot-ish device that will spread the sand automatically as it moves up the table. I'm a bit stumped best to implement a sand spreading mechanism though. Sand is obviously not great if it gets into motors etc. so coming up with something with few moving parts is the aim.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently trying to understand how a brake-by-wire system in a Honda Accord Hybrid 2017 actually works. I've looked everywhere and at the manufactures servicing website. But this is all I could come up with but I'm not sure if it is completely correct. Can someone please help me verify if the components of this braking system work as outlined below? Any insight or help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you :)

\- The brake system indicator lights up initially during start-up of the car and when there is a malfunction with one of its components. 

\- When brake pedal is activated, the pedal feel simulator is actuated.

\- Contained within the pedal feel simulator is the master cylinder, pedal force simulator, fluid pressure sensor and the respective valves.  

\- The pedal feel simulator reproduces the feel when the brake pedals are pressed.

\- After actuation, electric signals are sent to an actuator to convert the signal to allow hydraulic operation within the master cylinder, by sending hydraulic impulses to move the cylinder.

\- The master cylinder is connected to a fluid reservoir which allows the movement of the piston.  

\- Next, hydraulic signals from the master cylinder are sent to the tandem motor cylinder that contains its own fluid reservoir. 

\- The purpose of the tandem motor cylinder is to evenly distribute the hydraulic signal, therefore pressure, to the front and rear brakes via the brake hose and line. 

\-  When pressure is received at both ends of the car, the hydraulics further actuate the calipers allowing the brake pads to compress on to the brake disc allowing movement reduction to the car.

Most people say that so long as you're attaching to the thick steel tubes/beams that form the bulkhead and rear frame (which are often about 1/8"" steel), its completely fine (especially if you use some sort of washer or other attachment that can distribute the pressure). After all, these are meant to provide some degree of safety in an accident. Others say you're going to destroy your van and kill babies and puppies because it isn't made for these forces.

You can probably tell that I'm in the former group... 

How would you go about calculating the thickness and shape of steel tubes that would be necessary to support hanging a hammock with up to 500lbs (for a safety factor) that would be exerting forces in varying directions as it swings? 

Or is the movement even relevant? I assume that you just want to stay within the elastic stress-strain zone, so could you just use some number like the the Yield Strength of varying thicknesses and/or shapes of tubing? Moreover, if a washer was used rather than a single screw, I assume you could spread the force over the entire area?

66,"My employer is requiring a 3 year contract for training, should I agree to this?",1547522336,"Hello everyone,

I'm a Mech E and I've been out of school for roughly 2 years.

During those 2 years, I've worked for the same employer and enjoyed it rather well. I also feel like I have become fairly proficient at my job during that time.

Although today at work I feel like I got blindsided.

My employer wants to pay for me to attend two training courses.

The first is a 3 week course for roughly $20,0000 with travel expenses. (3 year contract)

The second is a 1 week course for roughly $4,500. (9 month contract)

The problem is they want me to sign a contract saying that I will work for them for the next 3 years or I will be forced to repay them the pro-rated cost of those trainings.

To me it seems like a really shitty situation. Even if I wasn't already having second thoughts about leaving, it's essentially a huge financial risk for almost no guaranteed benefit to me. There is a lot that could happen over the course of those 3 years that could potentially be out of my control that would require me to move. In addition, I feel like at that point they would essentially own me. In the event I was unfairly treated or forced to work ridiculous hours, I would essentially be trapped.

The thing that makes it even worse is I'll likely require at least 2 more trainings in 2-3 years. At that point, it's like when would I ever be able to get out?

Does anyone know if this is a fairly common practice in industry? Am I crazy for thinking that I need to find a new job ASAP? I would highly doubt I would be let go for not signing the contract, but it could impact my standing to the point where I don't think it would be wise to stay there.

Has anyone else dealt with this type of situation? Let me know what you're thoughts are. I'll only have a few days to make a decision.

74,How to create a part numbering system from scratch that fits my new company's needs?,1547513507,"**TLDR:** I’ve recently started my own company and I’m working to build a proper part numbering system for my products that fits my needs. I am crafting my system to avoid the pitfalls of my previous company based on my knowledge of the industry, but I am having some issues with the finer details and I’m looking for some input from others.

**About:** Hello all! I’ve recently started a design and manufacturing company after working for another company in the industry for ten years. Now that I am creating my own products, I need a way to number and document them in detail. At my previous company no proper thought was given to the part numbering system – and as a result it was very inconsistent, arbitrary, and confusing.

I’m sure we’ve all had bad experiences with part numbering systems like this and wished we could rebuild them with our current knowledge, and since I have the opportunity to create this from scratch I want to make sure I do it right from the start. I’ve searched through the threads here and I’ve read a lot of REALLY good information that has taught me quite a bit, but nothing has touched on the specific issues I am running into.

**The new system:** Without revealing too much information about my business, I will be designing and building custom devices that interface with other equipment to perform a variety of tasks. The equipment I will be interfacing with can vary greatly depending on manufacturer, size, style, or age – and each of these variations may require a different custom device. Right now, I’m building an intelligent part numbering system based on the criteria above.

What I’ve come up with so far is a 7 digit part number broken down into four different categories: 1) Task being performed, 2) Equipment family, 3) Equipment sub-family, and 4) Configuration. So, my part numbers look like this (Spaces added to show the four categories – there will be no spaces in the actual part number):

**1 001 A 01** 

Where the first “1” defines the task to be performed, the “001” is a sequentially assigned number that defines the equipment family, the “A” defines the equipment sub-family, and the “01” defines the configuration.

The reasoning for this part number is based on the maximum number of variables for each category. Based on my experience in this industry I have determined the number of different tasks to be 6; the number of potential equipment families to be approximately 500; the number of equipment sub-families is determined by the specific parent family and should not exceed 20; and the number of configurations (Which are usually minor changes based on customer request) to be no more than 40.

**The problems:** Even with all the research I’ve done and time I've spent on this, I’m still running into issues. Some of the issues I’ve been having include:

* I would like for the “Equipment family” sequential number (001-999) to be common across all tasks. For example 6025C03 and 2025E19 are both compatible with equipment family “025”. But, this presents an issue because there are certain instances where overlap can occur. For example, a device for one task may be compatible with two or more equipment families, but a device for a different task is not compatible with the same set of families. Grouping the common families for one task would cause numbering issues with other tasks, but keeping them separate would result in multiple part numbers for the same device.
* Each device with this 7 digit part number is the top level assembly and will be made up of different parts and sub-assemblies. I now need to find the best way to define part numbers for the sub-assemblies that make up the top level assembly, the parts that make up the top level assembly, the parts that make up sub-assemblies, and so on and so forth.
* Taking the previous bullet point a step further, each top level assembly, sub-assembly, and part may have associated mechanical drawings, electrical schematics, or different literature such as manuals based on the assembly or part. These should also be numbered to be able to quickly associate them with the proper top level assembly, sub-assembly, or part.
* Next, each of the top level assemblies, sub-assemblies, parts, drawings, schematics, and literature needs an element of revision control to ensure that the most up to date designs or documents are being used. I am looking at using the “A1” revision system where the “A” denotes a major change and the “1” denotes a minor change. If the changes affect the interchangeability of the part or sub-assembly in the next assembly then it should be assigned a new part number.

**Last word:** If you’ve made it this far, congratulations – it’s almost over! I know a lot of the responses are going to recommend some type of PDM to keep all this straight and I agree. But, since I’m just starting and using free software where available, professional level PDM is not an option for me right now due to cost. My goal is to establish the system first while I get off the ground, and once I can afford it, purchase PDM software and transfer everything over with the rules I have already established.

78,Any tips on an automated Electric Kazoo?,1547510374," 

Hi Reddit!

I've been pondering automating something that most discount as something of a layman's instrument. Recently I was given a kazoo from my nephew as a Christmas gift. I thought it was a delightful surprise, I didn't expect him to gift me anything and it turned out to be something I would think about considerably.

How I understand it, in order to operate a kazoo, one needs to utilize their vocal cords to reverberate the air coming out of their lungs to form a pitch in the kazoo. The vibrating air hits a wax membrane on the top of the kazoo and creates that noise that most are far too familiar with. In place of lungs, I thought about using an air compressor and in place of vocal cords, I would use a vibration motor. To form different notes, I would need to adjust the rate at which the vibration motor runs. To adjust loudness, I would change the amount of air running through the motor.

Is this correct in theory or am I missing something? I understand I could just get a kazoo with a pickup and run it through an amp, but I am far from a singer so it would help to be able to reach perfect notes.",AskEngineers,False,Piegizmo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ag276a/any_tips_on_an_automated_electric_kazoo/

85,How can I start a DC motor with a 12 V battery?,1547500797," As a school project, I'm building an RC car, and I've run into a roadblock:  

I purchased a 12V 30 RPM gearmotor and (at the moment) I'm just trying to get it running using a switch and a battery. So, I also decided to buy some small A23 12 volt batteries to use alongside it. However, when I tested the motor today with the battery, it did not budge. The A23 batteries, as I discovered later, only outputted a current of &lt;200 mA. As far as I've been able to find, the gearmotor needs about 2 amps. So, how can I achieve this current without putting 10 A23 batteries in parallel?  

As a side note, I cannot have the battery(ies) be too heavy or big, as the chassis is not particularly large or strong, and I have no problems with going to home depot or something to buy a new battery.

I don't really know anyone in person who works in the field so I figured I'd ask you guys here instead.

But first, a little background:

I'm 17 years old, female, and I live in the Philippines. I originally wanted to be a Robotics Engineer (I still do) but I didn't want to study RBE in undergrad 'cause I wanted to keep my options open. So I decided to study EE 'cause it had a lot of applications to robotics (robotics as in Boston Dynamics style, not industrial automation). At the same time, I found a lot of its sub-disciplines to be very interesting and exciting to make a career out of — stuff like control systems, signal processing, optics, electromagnetism, and RF just to name a few. I'd also like to work in the aerospace industry if the opportunity presents itself. For now though, I'd really just like to focus on pure Electrical Engineering.

So now, here are my questions:

* In what sub-field do you currently work in right now and can you give a brief description about what it focuses on and such?
* What is your title and what does the typical day look like for you?
* Which part about your job do you really like and enjoy? And which part do you dislike/like the least?
* What made you choose to go into EE? And into your chosen sub-field?
* Would you recommend your field to me in terms of demand, salary, travel incentives, variation of roles, and other opportunities?
* Do you have any specific and underrated college tips you'd like to give? Preferably about what I should do now to have more things to put on my resume later on.
* Outside the more STEM-y things, what do you think engineers, in general, should give more attention to to be more well-rounded?

So is there a need for *fuel de-aerating*? Especially in fighter jets, because they maneuver a lot, will this cause the fuel to churn in its wing, causing the fuel pump to suck in a lot of air?

As an add on, I read from multiple sources tanks in wings can operate in high-g situations simply by having *multiple fuel ports* leading out of them. I find this a little confusing. Let's say a fighter is dashing, so all the fuel in its tank is rushing to the *rearmost part* of the tank. If this tank has a front and a back fuel port, and they are being sucked *by the same pump*, will this result in something like a 50/50 fuel/air mixture?

“What cement should I use for this concrete slab?” 

“How do womens brains work?”

18,Need some help with an adjustable height platform,1547431022,"Hi everyone,

I'm working on a project for a height adjustable bed for special needs and chronic illness patients, and we're looking to make the bed's height easily adjustable between the ground (or as close to it as we can get) and about 3ft maximum height. Ideally this could be done electronically or as simply as possible for the caregiver.

Two ideas I've looked into thus far are linear actuators and scissor lifts, but both seem to have critical issues. I looked into linear actuators due to their prevalence in standing desks, but everything I've looked at seems to have a compressed length that is higher than we are looking for in this application. I also looked at scissor lifts (Not necessarily motorized, just the concept), but most were too expensive (We have a budget of $2000 for the project) and had weight capacities far out of our range. Furthermore, I was not able to find anything with the form factor of a twin bed. Would this be something that could be built relatively easily (its a senior design project so we're all college level mechanical engineers, and we have access to a machining lab with basic equipment including bandsaws, lathes, mills, etc)?

If neither of these options are feasible, does anyone have other possible ideas? I've spent a lot of time researching both of these ideas and I'm struggling to think of alternative options.

19,Which turnover is faster?,1547430977,"Scenario:  A vented atmospheric vessel contains 5% NaOH and needs to be drained and rinsed.  The vessel has rinse water piped up to it.  The vessel is considered throughly rinsed when the discharge fluid is the same pH as the rinse water (around 7 or so).  To turnover the vessel, is it faster to: A) Continuously rinse the vessel with the rinse valve open maintaining fluid level while continually draining your mixture B) Drain the vessel, successively fill the vessel with rinse water, and drain again?  Note that the flow is not idealized plug flow, there is mixing even without agitation. 

My Conclusion(s): Had this discussion with front line supervisors when they contested that continuously feeding and discharging a vessel was the quickest way to turn over the caustic residue which had been used to clean it.  I concluded it was merely the laziest way, mentally and physically.  And it was more wasteful.  They were also skeptical when I completed a rinsing as a side activity within a shift while they had been stretching it out over a day(s).

I believe another engineer had convinced them that discharge flows in atmospheric tanks diminished as the fluid level decreased.  While true, what said engineer neglected to consider was that the fluid did not move ideally (plug flow) through the vessel and that there was axial mixing even without agitation.  So, even though the discharge flow is at a maximum when fluid height is maintained, the mixing of residual caustic in the vessel with rinse water replacing discharged caustic (and water) causes the discharge concentration of caustic to lower with time and the amount of NaOH moved per volume of rinse water continued to go down.   Tank dimensions and flow capacities do change the magnitudes of these effects, but the conclusions should generally be the same.  In this situation, any gains made by keeping the discharge flow maximized were far offset by mixing effects that continuously reduced the residual concentration of caustic.",AskEngineers,False,hollowiagg,/r/AskEngineers/comments/afqqyh/which_turnover_is_faster/

21,What approach would you take to find a 1kg bar of gold buried on a 30 acre property?,1547426582,"So, this is an unusual situation... 

A 1kg bar of gold was buried by an individual who is now deceased. It was initially thought to be a bar-story, but has been corroborated by independent parties. 

It is worth noting that this recovery is not meant to generate profit, the sentimental value of the buried object is of more importance than its monetary worth. With that being said, the sentimental value is not extreme, but nonetheless substantial enough to be worth exploring recovery options seriously. 

Not much is known about where this bar of gold was buried, however it is certain that it is buried on a 30 acre property (lawfully owned by the party trying to recover it). It is very likely that the depth of the bar is within 5-6ft of the surface (soil). It is known that the bar was buried within the last fifteen years. 

* Initial thought: Use ground penetrating radar to cover the 30 acres with an GSSI SIR-2000, which would cost 3-5 thousand USD (only the cost to rent), however this presumes ideal conditions, an experienced operator (which would boost the cost substantially), and does not consider field conditions that may interfere with the approach.  
* Second thought: task a satellite equipped with an SAR to take a 1km x 1km image of the area. Cost wise I believe this to be the most effective route, not to mention the least invasive (interested party is mourning). While it will cost several thousand dollars to do this as well, I currently believe it to be the most promising option. Of course, having a conversation with a satellite telemetry expert would be the first step to determining the feasibility of this. 
* Third thought: Analyze gold contents of plants on the property...? Very time consuming and likely futile considering the bar of gold may be in a water-proof container.

Previously I was under the impression that the BMU wouldn't have something like that and planned to feed the output from it into a distribution unit that would contain all the recommended fuses and pre-charge circuits for each individual component (a few of the components actually have in built circuits already). 

How do I go about calculating the pre-charge capacity for the whole system? Is it just a matter of summing the input capacitance value for all components? and if this circuit is implemented is it unnecessary to have the individual ones?

33,What is my professional title?,1547409051,"Hi, need a bit of career advice here. 

21 years old, currently have an AS in Engineering Technology &amp; finishing up my BS in Engineering Technology at an ABET accredited online school. Expected to be finished by end of 2019. I have been working in the industry I briefly describe below for 4 years with a title of ""Control Systems Technician"" (first career-related job out of high school so they trained me), however I do much more &amp; am referred to as an ""Engineer in Training"" at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I unofficially call myself an ""Engineering Technician"" but don't really know what to list on my resume anymore because I wear so many hats at work: Web Designer, IT Support, Control System Tech, Engineer in training, Quality Assurance (panel troubleshooting / testing), and Plant Foreman (which I'm looking at a promotion for right now). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had nothing but compliments on my work ethic by the owner &amp; my superiors. The owner has flat out said he wants me to take over the business and ""sit in his seat"" when he retires but too many things I've been left hanging on to believe it. I can also tell he is nervous I may leave the company in that I am a key employee at by some of the comments he makes. Not sure why I'm left hanging so much with that being said so it's time to update the resume.

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a control systems integrator in one of the southern states. We build electrical control panels for automation, some cheaper panels that rely on relay logic but these days I'm seeing more &amp; more PLC panels. Our biggest markets are water / wastewater in pump up / pump down applications. We do a lot of work with SCADA, PLCs, and VFDs. I have moderate experience in programming VFDs and only general knowledge of PLCs right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very experienced in control panel fabrication, in the control system design process, and field service. I have traveled for work to different states to work as a control systems technician to upgrade a factory's infrastructure when we have been contracted by other automation companies, which was great professional experience. I consider myself fluent in AutoCAD 2D &amp; manage our CAD symbol libraries and drawing process. I have designed hundreds of control systems wiring diagrams that automate lift stations, conveyor systems, car washes, etc to customer specification.

&amp;#x200B;

However too many promises that have been made to me do not have much weight or take too much time to make a reality. I'm often left hanging. I'm thinking about the ""move out to move up"" route since I do not like where I work very much. The work culture, atmosphere, etc. are quite toxic so I show up, do my job excessively well (by the remarks of others), don't talk much, and most of my suggestions in company-wide meetings are integrated into the process. We have 15 employees and I can confidently say that I am very well respected in this company but the culture there, place I live, etc. make me want to explore my options.

Is it possible to create a positive sum total of energy (in a renewable fashion) by using energy created from that thing? So here is what I'm thinking. If we can harness the energy from a waterfall to generate hydroelectric power, can we use that hydro electric power to move water back ""up"" to a position of potential energy again so that it once again falls into the power plant? Would there be a positive gain in energy, or would you lose too much energy moving the water back up to the top of the circuit with an Archimedes screw or something? If it is possible, why is this not a thing? (And if it is a thing already, can you tell me an example of a current one?)

Here is the section:

""As the current approaches 100 milliamps, ventricular fibrillation of the heart occurs - an uncoordinated twitching of the walls of the heart's ventricles which results in death.
Above 200 milliamps, the muscular contractions are so severe that the heart is forcibly clamped during the shock. This clamping protects the heart from going into ventricular fibrillation, and the victim's chances for survival are good.""

46,What does it mean to be an Engineer?,1547350027,"Let me clarify.

I recently graduated with a bachelors of science in aerospace engineering and have a job at an aerospace company as a systems engineer.

However, it seems to me, that in the United States at least, there are many positions with the word ""engineer"" in the title, and that the word has become somewhat overused.

For example, locomotive engineer, or technology engineer.

Perhaps I am being an elitist, but I would like some clarification. I grew up in a household that viewed this country's rampant use of the title as problematic, and I for the life of me, cannot fathom how someone who hasn't taken Statics, Dynamics, Differential Equations,  or Thermodynamics can qualify as an Engineer. I have heard this isn't as much of an issue in other countries.

I have read, somewhere, I don't know where now, that Engineers are one of only two undergraduate degrees that qualify as a ""professional degree"" (I think the other one was architecture but I can't remember the details.) Is this right? What does that mean?

I have also read, somewhere, that there is a difference between a position with the word ""engineer"" in the title, vs. ""Engineer"", the latter of which requiring the standard bachelor of science in engineering degree.

I also realize, that many people who aren't qualified, do actually think like an Engineer, and could be a damn good one. I've also met Engineers who barely have any concept of what Engineering is. So I'm not so elitist that I realize education means everything.

So, could someone help me understand? I have a friend who calls himself a network engineer. I am assuming his position is so-titled, but he's never gone to college and only has certificates.

Am I an asshole for not respecting him as an Engineer? I certainly don't look down on him at all, but it irks me that he thinks he has my credentials.

47,Combining Off-Grid and Grid-Tie Inverters?,1547345194,"If I would put grid-tie micro inverters, sourced from a PV array onto a system which has an AC output sourced by a battery backup off-grid inverter, how can I ensure that it draws from the micro inverters first, instead of the batteries?

Background:
I'm working in Haiti, trying to do low-budget systems, so we have some issues.
The current one is that the maximum charge rate of flooded lead acid batteries is usually ~13% of the capacity or so. Consequently, I need to limit the input current to batteries there.
But my only current limit setting is on the output of the charge controller. This limit is, effectively, a limit for simultaneous inverter draw + battery charging, but doesn't know how to tell the difference.

So, if I size my array to cover the expected system load, plus the battery charging, I will exceed the recommend charge current at any point that the system is running a smaller load than expected, such as a weekend for a commercial installation.

Could I put in an mppt charge controller that is current limited to the battery charging maximum, and then put additional panels on micro-inverters to meet the AC load demands during the day?
The off-grid inverter would then be the ""grid"" for the micro-inverters to sync with, but, hopefully be drawing a near zero load from the batteries. Is this a feasible solution?

Otherwise, I'm looking at using a microcontroller with a current shunt to either disengage extra solar panels or turn on ""dump loads"" like a water heater when there is an excessive PV:load ratio..",AskEngineers,False,f1engineering,/r/AskEngineers/comments/afekkr/combining_offgrid_and_gridtie_inverters/

49,Engineer taking Patent Bar Exam | Questions / Advice,1547341911,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello guys,

I wanted to ask for some career advice. I've posted this question in another small subreddit but did not have any responses. I am sorry if it is not directly correlates to practicing engineers, but people with an engineering or science background qualify for the exam. My questions are directed to the engineers or scientists that have had experience as patent practitioners / agents.

For background. I am a mechanical engineer working in the HVAC industry (which I dread) and have recently found out about the patent bar / patent agent career path. I am about to begin studying for the exam. Some of my questions include:

1. I know it is not necessary to have already passed the patent bar exam to get a job as a patent examiner, but if passing it, is it easier to get hired and would you get a better starting salary?
2. What is the timeframe of a patent examiner to be able to work from home (telework)?
3. What are your recommendations in terms of working in the public sector (USPTO) or private sector (Law Offices)?
4. I am aware that the USPTO will cover tuition costs of going to law school if you agree to work with them for some time. Has anyone done this? If yes, would you recommend? Since I am still young I don't see why this should be out of the picture, but want to get a feel for the ""industry"" before giving this serious thought.

Our job is to basically develop applications to run on small controllers, and it is a block based program which we call ""coding"" for mechanical engineers.

53,Another MechE washout (Switching to Industrial?),1547333628,"Background: Was in the military for 5 years, did marine recon, now I'm a mechanical engineering second semester sophomore.  I did mechanical are because I wanted to do something that was challenging, to see if I actually enjoyed it and because I had the focus and dedication from doing some pretty hard stuff in recon (people would quit all the time and I would look down on them) .  I've been thinking about doing industrial now for about a year because I really like learning about management, business, and economics.  I've been wholesaling houses in my spare time through direct mail marketing and the further I go down this hole, the more I realize I'm NEVER going to use this shit.  I justify the curriculum with ""Without learning this stuff in school your brain would be entirely different and you wouldn't be as resourceful."" I like to think of it as the ultimate muscle pump for your brain..idk.  Also, I NEVER studied or did anything in high school.  Tbh, a lot of people thought I was dumb which was another reason why I wanted to do mechanical to prove to myself I can do it (I know I'm not the only one).  My goal was (is) to do sales engineering, not gonna lie I'm somewhat personable and everyone says I look like Jon Hamm.  I'm not trying to be conceited, but this is another reason why I feel like I can excel in business.  My goal is to learn the ins and outs of a manufacturing business to its entirety and hopefully acquire a manufacturing plant later down the road.   I feel that the best way to do this is by becoming an IE.  My friend who's a bioe does sales engineering for a manufacturing company and says the manufacturing learning curve is pretty huge.   

Reasons to stay MechE: I haven't got into the meat of everything actually interesting  (just started intro thermo, circuits, statics 2, materials, diff eq). 

I'm self conscious af and don't want to be looked down on me for switching to IE.   I told everyone I was doing mechanical and it just would fucking suck being ""that guy"" that switched.  Being in the marines and seeing people that weren't grunts (pogs), you hated them...because they have it easy.  You would see people quit to become pogs hate them because they took the easy way out. 

Don't know if I'll like it that much more?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Leave:  I'm trying to spend more time on developing my real estate llc.  This includes learning how to scale it, finance it, all the business stuff.  Instead of learning on my own time,  I might as well hit 2 birds with one stone and apply my school knowledge to my business.  

My sales engineering internship that pays pretty well are half IE half MechE.

In the end I don't think I would ever have a ""design"" related role.  Solidworks HVAC's all day...kill me.

ALL my classes transfer right into IE and I lose no time.

I have no other offers, but I have other companies I'd like to check out (albeit it's late to do so, but I do have connections I could use). That isn't guaranteed, but it is a plausibility. I haven't had any previous internships. 

They've only given me less than two days to decide. I've sent an email asking about the housing reimbursement and more details about the job.

Should I reject the internship offer, in the hopes of finding something better, but risking not having an official internship (but having a more interesting backup plan which might pay less). Or should I make the commitment to accept the internship, blocking any other (most likely far better) opportunities?

TLDR: I have a software engineering internship offer which pays more than my backup plan (of doing innovative research in fields I'm interested in), but is a bit less interesting, involves more logistics, and accepting it blocks me from higher-paying opportunities my peers usually get. I have less than two days to decide. Should I accept, or reject? ",AskEngineers,False,jetfire314,/r/AskEngineers/comments/af9c94/should_i_reject_this_internship_offer_less_than_2/

22,Choosing a MSc in the University of Cranfield,1547206877," 

Hi! I'm a last year student of aerospace engineering (in Europe) and I'm trying to pick a MSc in Cranfield, but I'm quite doubtful and definitely need Reddit's help!

I would like to know your opinions on what you think it's a better option relating: employment, potential of the field (how strong it will be in some years), approximated salary... I am equally interested in the four of them. It would really help me if you shared your opinions of these to make my final decision:

23,How to visualize/evaluate correlation between experimental values and various prediction models?,1547199779,"What are some statistical methods I can use to show the accuracy of different predictive methods compared to experimental values? Bar plots or box plots of the percent error for various data points?

I am trying to accurately model a mechanical system analytically and numerically (FEA). In literature there are various theories and methods that can be used to predict the mechanical properties I am interested in. I have a database of 100+ experimental values of unique tests that I can compare predicted values to in order to evaluate the accuracy of these various theories.

The thing is, there isn't a single variable I am changing in these tests. I am trying to predict the properties of a composite sandwich beam and I am varying the number of layers (lamina), lamina material, core material, lamina fiber orientation, etc. Each test is a unique sandwich beam construction, as in sample size is only 1 for each test specimen.

The end goal is to find which modeling method is the most accurate to these experimental values, and to use it to predict values to minimize experimentation.

Power Systems EE considering starting a Lighting &amp; HVAC design company for greenhouses. Or, possibly a company that designs greenhouses from the ground up for client purposes. Realistically, it's my idea to cash in on the coming wave of Rec MMJ in the state when it's passed. But, I am in an area of the Appalachian region that does a decent amount of farming as well. My feet are already substantially wet in landscape contracting (built &amp; sold one, bringing another out of infancy currently), and long term goals include expansion into excavating as well as general contracting (and some other business ventures of unrelated topics).

Trying to find investment opportunities that also keep me close to my educational interests and that I have the knowledge/aptitude to be the ""CEO"" of without being entirely disconnected from employees on a work experience / educational basis. This one has been a growing idea as public opinions on things change and I feel it's an area ripe for growth once the proper channels are made within the next few years.   


So I ask the various engineers of Reddit if you think this is a viable opportunity and/or idea. My concern is that well-established multi-discipline firms already exist in the state and would likely be able to do the same thing I'm looking to do.

33,Physics degree: feeling a little lost about my future,1547181084,"Hi, as the title says I'm feeling a little lost right now and need some advice and perspective. I'm 9 weeks away from graduating with a degree in physics and a minor in electrical engineering from an ABET-accredited institution on the West Coast. My GPA is okay, 3.2 overall, 3.4 major. I have two summers worth of research experience in an unrelated field of physics and one summer working for a startup (I'm in the Bay Area).

I believe that I want to get into the aerospace field and I am most strongly drawn to the idea of a career doing computational fluid/structural mechanics. I've applied to a few MSAE programs and I am waiting to hear back from them. In the meantime I'd like to find a job so I can get some experience in the field and ideally have it while in graduate school.

The bottom line is that because my school does not have an aerospace engineering degree and my degree was in Physics I have no existing network to leverage and no idea where to start. The way the different fields of AE interact and are expressed in industry and how it functions as a whole is a mystery to me and so I'm also feeling a little overwhelmed. I know there is a lot of new information, like fluid mechanics, that I need to learn but without a job where I can apply it I feel like I'm just wasting my time trying to learn it right now.

Forgive me if this is a lot, I'm prone to anxiety and definitely feeling it right now.

37,How do you deal with supervisors when they are wrong about something but too stubborn to accept it (especially new out of college),1547173040,"so I am two months into a 3 month intern to hire (hopefully) program.  I have an M.Sc, but prior to this job I had no industry experience.  The company I work at puts every new internship hire into the ""design"" (CAD and technical drawings mostly) track under one single supervisor (it is a relatively small aerospace startup).

Anyway, I had a routing, drilling, and scribing tool that I designed for a composite part which had a lot of oddly located features, and the best way by far to denote those features was with an xy table (similar to a hole table).  But my supervisor told me that it wasn't in the mechanical drawing policy for the company, and assigned it to another more experienced designer yesterday.  Today, the other designer told me that my way was way better than the way she insisted it should be done.  Also today, she took me into a conference room and reamed me out about arguing with her about drawing policy (when I simply voiced my opinion), but I spoke with several other people at the company and I am not the only one who has an issue with her policy (she reviews every single mechanical drawing that gets released).

Obviously, I don't want to go into much more detail, but how would everyone suggest I deal with this issue.  The other ""designers"" typically just sit and take it, but I am just not built like that.  I am hoping to get a full time job with this company in a month in an RE position that doesn't directly report to her, but she does give a recommendation to the CEO who does the interviews for hiring off of internships, and even if I do get that position, I will still have to send all drawings through her.

42,Burned Out Systems Engineer,1547169181,"I always liked science, and when I took physics, I learned to love math because for once it had a realistic use. 10 years out of school, with a B.S. in Aerospace and an M.S. in Systems, and I'm so disillusioned. I've been working as a government contractor since my second semester of freshman year of college, and moved from what one would consider Phase E of the system engineering lifecycle to now Phase A. I'm not sure if it's because I've only ever worked for the government, but I've learned so much about how not to do things. My masters program also highlighted how thing go wrong when you don't do follow good system engineering practices, and it seemed like every project I worked on was a case study on what one should never do. For a long time, my goal was always to get started on a project as early in Phase A as possible so that I could try to make a difference, and perhaps not cause as much pain, suffering, and money wasted as I had seen/experienced.

I'm here, and I see people are setting themselves up for failure. I'm defining failure as coming up with a solution to a problem that hasn't really been well defined, a solution that wastes money, and is focused on continuing to do things like they've been done before for the sake of heritage, but not because they worked well or efficiently. Because of this, I'm sort of having a crisis about this career I've chosen. At my last job (with a different contractor and project, but with the same agency), I spoke a lot to my manager about feeling a bit like a Cassandra where I see bad choices being made, I make a point to highlight what can and has gone wrong with projects when the same choice was made, and provide an alternative. I asked my manager about how I could perhaps improve my communications and persuasion skills because clearly my point is not coming across. He essentially said that he didn't think I had any issues communicating so I just don't know anymore. I can't think of a single time where I've convinced the person making the decision, and nearly every single time within a year, whatever I warned about came true. Every time, tiger teams and failure review boards are created, and each time I have emails where it's documented that I identified the risk associated with the decision, and the response from higher management about it not being a priority. It's not like I send these emails to anyone or I'm like I told you so, because at that point, it's my job to come up with a bandaid for whatever crappy decision was made. However, I feel like I've been in this infinite loop for the last 6 years. 

Is this what being a systems engineer is always like? Is this what being an aerospace engineer is like?

Warning - Complaining ahead:

I'm a utilities consulting engineer with 4 years experience. I'm essentially the only person in my company that has the experience for a certain software that our client (really big power company) wants, while still making a profit. I'll note that since the project started, I've gotten a raise and we are pretty much breaking even. This project started before a pretty sizable contract began which allows access to other projects, so just ""breaking it off"" would be detrimental to that agreement (or so I'm told). The work was supposed to be relatively fun, and I was supposed to utilize my automation skills, which was why I was sought after in the first place. Turns out that the client likes that idea, but would prefer me spend hours modeling and analyzing these projects. The automation potential turns out to not even be available due to their software version.

I'm approaching one year into these projects &amp; I am bored to death. I am to a point to where I can't focus, and even a higher dose of my ADHD medicine hasn't helped. I get \~4 hours done on a good day. Vacation hasn't helped. I'm not growing, despite my attempts to make a positive from a negative. Before this project, I was about to be used for some other really exciting projects. There are tasks in the project that are just tedious, and all on a remote computer that we can't even assign to lower skilled workers, per pushback from the client.

My manager and the PM have tried to hire or find within the company somebody to wean me off and be more profitable to no avail since 4 months ago. They know I'm pulling my hair on this, though I'm also not verbally complaining. Nobody has enough experience or is too expensive. I've about had it, and am starting to look for other jobs. Before going straight there, is there any advice I can get on this situation? Should I try to push to get out of the project, even if it means the relationship with the customer may be broken? I've expressed my frustrations, but not so much that it seems like I've had enough. I really like my job in general, and the company, and the people, and pay. This project is projected to keep on going until 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any help!

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a senior studying environmental engineering. I am trying to apply for jobs but with no luck so far.

I would go to a job anywhere in the United States that was either in or near a city or near good rock climbing. I believe a few things that are holding me back is that I did not do an internship and my GPA is only a 3.1. One of the reasons why I did not do any internships is because when I am in school I am focused on my school but when I have free time I use it to train for climbing.  My GPA is a little lower than I would have liked because I had to work to be able to afford rent and food. I really do love environmental engineering and I feel like I could offer a company a lot.

But I've been tapped at the workplace and the classroom many many times to be the speaker/presenter/""translator"" whether giving good or bad news. My bosses have always mentioned this as one of my core strengths.

I've worked hard on developing my people skills because in college if you want to work as a team you have to deal with a lot of unbearable/arrogant/awkward students that are otherwise really bright. And then similarly in the business world usually the most capable ones or the ones with the most power are the most difficult to get along with.

What are the industries to go into if I want to capitalize on this? I've always been told Sales Engineers are where the conversationalists go. But are there other industries that put an emphasis on communication skills? Or maybe industries where conversationalists gravitate, so I can enjoy the people I work with?

My worst nightmare is getting stuck in the typical IT situation where everyone stays buried in their computer monitor and not so secretly hates everyone. That was the IT portion of my first job and I literally avoided that room of the facility for the rest of my employment.

* Get an air cylinder actuator and connect it to a small 13ci paintball air tank. The issue here is that I don't think an air tank that small would last very long.

* Use an electric solenoid actuator. The problem with these is that I need something with at least 4 inches of stroke and these are all pretty short stroked. Also the one I've used before is super weak and wouldn't be strong enough to move a half pound of plastic on a rail bearing with the force that  want, if at all

* Use a stepper motor motor connected to a wheel which then provides linear motion similar to how the wheels on a steam engine works. The problem is that I don't think I'd be able to fit a 4"" wheel inside the gun to get 4"" of linear movement.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly,  I live in Sweden so tuition cost is 0 for me, being a doctor in Sweden also isn't as rigorous and harsh as in the USA. It's a pretty stable career in Sweden. In Sweden, basically all doctors make more than the majority of Engineers, including Engineer managers working the same or less hours (about 42hrs average for a doctor).

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking about this choice for about a year now, I am still not ""sure"". It may be a stupid question since I am actually more passionate about Engineering, I really like SpaceX, Nasa, Fighter-jets and it would be cool to be a part of the journey of going to Mars etc. There are other things that could potentially interest me in engineering aswell, but nothing that feels as meaningful as working on space development(loud stuff that goes fast). I would probably end up as a manager if I wish to advance in my career, but I'm not really interested in economy, and I don't want to end up in front of a computer working on an excel file.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, just because im passionate about something, do I have to make it my career? Going for medicine would allow me to live anywhere in Sweden, make a good salary with a fair bit of free time. I would also appreciate a ""hierarchy"" /military style, serious workplace, and I like working under pressure (I have some military experience).  I also find medicine interesting, I did natural science in highschool and I've read a lot during my free time. Several people have said that I would be a good doctor, and I have some working experience in healthcare.

&amp;#x200B;

One option for me is to try one year of med-school to see if I like it, if not I'll just go back to where I am now in Engineering. That may be a nobrainer for someone unsure, but it's one year of my life if I don't like it and a slowed-down engineering career.

56,Seeking Advice on Internship and Career Prospects (Graduating May 2019),1547007866,"Hello r/AskEngineers. I am a first time poster in this subreddit. I've read through the rules and have tried my best to follow them to the best of my ability writing this post. Please let me know if I've missed something. 

\&amp;nbsp;

First, some background. My undergraduate experience at uni has been very turbulent to say the least. After a messy divorce in early 2018, a myriad of personal and familial issues, and living paycheck to paycheck every summer and winter break, I find myself barreling towards graduation in May with little to no actual engineering experience outside of classes and projects. I've entered a sort of constant state of panic and anxiety about my future. I feel like all of my fellow graduating students have had at least two internships under their belt, have already applied to their jobs last semester, and have a strong grip on what they want their careers to be. While I'm here left behind at the finish line with no way to utilize my degree and equipped with a highly noncompetitive resume.

\&amp;nbsp;

A little bit about my academic career:  


* Started in Fall 2014, graduating in Spring 2019 (5 years to complete Bachelors)
* GPA: 2.811 (but hopefully improving after this semester)
* Major is Aerospace Engineering and Minor is Mathematics
* No experience in any engineering industry (internships or otherwise)
* All previous jobs in food and service industries only (with managerial experience)
* Not officially a member, past or current, of any club or extracurricular
* Possibly barred from work requiring security clearance because of my dual citizenship with a non-NATO country (which I was born in) and the United States
* Graduate school is out of the question because my GPA is too low and I am tired of taking on 5 years of unpaid, subsidized student debt

\&amp;nbsp;

Out of all of my classes, the most interesting topics which I wouldn't mind translating into an engineering position in the future would be any sort of software design/programming, control system design, electrical engineering/circuit design, mechatronics, aerodynamics, and rocket propulsion. Because of my limited exposure to actual engineering jobs (never got any internships), it's hard for me to visualize which jobs I should apply to in order to seek this kind of work.

\&amp;nbsp;

My biggest fear is graduating and continuing to work in the service industry with a mountain of student debt, doomed to living paycheck to paycheck and working 100 hour weeks. My second biggest fear is working at an engineering job which does not match my skills and interests and therefore essentially neutering my performance and salary at that job.

\&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr:** I'm just curious to see if there is anyone out there who lived through a similar situation as me and has a similar bleak outlook on the future regardless of all the hard work it took to earn this degree. My questions simplified:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is it worth trying to squeeze in an internship after graduation to make my resume more competitive for engineering positions?
2. What are some skills I could learn, certifications I can earn, and/or activities I can partake in to increase the competitiveness of my resume this late in my undergraduate career.
3.  What resources could I seek to pinpoint what discipline I want to pursue in lieu of internship experience.

59,Help in determining best way to handle a titanium part,1547004666,"Hi everyone. I was wondering if I could get some suggestions and ideas for a problem that I'm having. I'm an aerospace engineer working as a manufacturing engineer for a private aerospace company in California. 
In summary, one of the problems I'm having is figuring out the most ergonomic way for our technicians to handle a material we use to manufacture our parts, in this particular case is titanium. 
We use HAAS machines through our process with each machine doing one process at a time. During the initial phase, one of the machines does the roughing and cuts the top part of the titanium (usually 65"" in length and 20"" width is the size of the titanium part).
After the first cut, the technicians remove the titanium using a portable shop crane and they put the titanium on a pedestal. 
From there, 2 technicians place themselves on each end of the titanium and they flip the part. Then they use the crane to lift the titanium and place it back in the HAAS machine so the machine can work on the other side of the part.

Our problem is the flipping of the titanium. It's very heavy. We tried using the crane to lift the part and then flip it but we couldn't. 
Any suggestions or ideas as to what you would do in this situation? We are trying to prevent injuries and make our process more efficient.

I am having some difficulties choosing between Mechanical, Chemical, or EE. I am a freshman CHE right now, the problem is that i found out that i hate chemistry courses so much after taking general chemistry course, i took for sure a general physics course. I kind of had a faster understanding for the physics course than i did than any other course, and as i read that ME has so many things about torques and Newton's laws in general and Energies( energies and work), and also about fluids and stress and strains( fluids  and stress/strain part were a small chapters, first 15 chapters of Wiley book ). And i also interested some things like the thermodynamics law, i read about it and found it interesting. But i also heard people saying many different 

things such as "" ME is just about thermodynamics and fluids"", "" ME is just about materials and how to use them "", "" ME is just a little bit of some other engineering majors "", it is not clear at all.

I got my bachelors in Mechanical engineering several years ago. The reason I went into Mechanical Engineering was to eventually work my way up and get into Aerospace as that has always been my dream since I was a kid.

After graduating I went into more of an engineering/ sales role...not a sales engineer but someone who does engineering work with our customers and I have been doing so for a while now. There is a decent amount of money in these kinds of jobs you can make between $100,000-$150,000 per year, you are also not in the office all the time and get to go out a lot with customers and take them out to lunch and what not. The problem with these jobs is that you are always hustling, environments can be harsh and cut throat and you arent really developing yourself as a normal engineer I assume would. 

I finally got an aerospace engineering opportunity but it would require me to move half way across the country away from my friends and family and I probably will be taking big pay cut. The position is an early career position for a large aerospace company. The vision is to go back to school study and advance my way in this career.

&amp;#x200B;

I am graduating this May with my Bachelor's. I have been interning for a large MEP firm for the past two years and I plan on staying with them after graduation.   I have a question about the salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that a brand new employee (no prior knowledge experience) is offered a starting salary of $58k for an Engineer I.  My offer was $66k as an Engineer I.  From multiple conversations I have had with my supervisor and the Sr. Mechanical engineer, they have both told me that my skill level is that of an Engineer II and they want me to get that promotion as soon as possible or even before I start.   The $66k is on the higher end of the salary range for an Engineer I.     


My question: Should I ask for a higher salary to reflect the level they value me at?   Is it pushing it for me to ask for $70-$72k?     I have looked online at different salary calculators (glassdoor, dice, payscale, and salary..) and they all have a lot of varying information.",AskEngineers,False,Matt8992,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aduz3l/salary_question_atlanta_ga/

94,Tin-lead stripping solution in semiconductor manufacturing - what should I watch out for?,1546955186,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Not an engineer, but I am tasked with procuring nitric-acid based tin-lead stripper for the company that I work for.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a small company and fairly young. As you can imagine, being a young company - the engineers there are not exactly finding enough free time to strike up a good conversation and for me learn deeply about the subject... so I thought I'd turn to reddit to get some thoughts. (Because I want to know all the in-and-outs of the things I work on)

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of it will be to strip tin and tin-lead from stainless-steel belt and pincer-holders, after submersing the ICs in tin.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: **What are the Quality-Control metric that I best be aware of when purchasing the products?** Most vendors only state (1) their stripping speed (e.g. 5 mcg/30 minutes), (2) the amount of tin it can hold before it forms a sludge (100g per litre/20 oz. per gallon) and (3) Specific Gravity (&gt;1.2). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Are there other things I should look out, either at the outset or on an on-going basis from the vendor, to reduce risk for my firm?**

&amp;#x200B;

An example of the tin-lead stripper I am looking is by Dow: [https://www.dow.com/en-us/product-search/grades/envirostripmetalstrippers/envirostrip785](https://www.dow.com/en-us/product-search/grades/envirostripmetalstrippers/envirostrip785)

99,Motor sizing for small electric vehicles?,1546927498,"This came up in a pseudo-expert discussion of motor sizing on the new trend of electric skateboards and eventually lead to electric cars and motorcycles, the general gist is: Is it better to have a bigger motor if possible and how big is too big?

&amp;#x200B;

The motors are assume to be all brushless (BLDC) motors using permanent magnets on the rotor. Won't get into electric car motors. The following questions would all have the following assumptions: The motors are all driven by identical motor control units at identical voltage, and all motors are built with the same materials, identical winding pattern with negligible difference in bearing friction and weight (knowing that a larger motor will be heavier, but for the purpose of this discussion it is not relevant).

&amp;#x200B;

In a case of highly variable speed and load, if the goal was to maximize performance (power delivery) with efficiency being next, would it be more ideal to have a smaller motor spinning at a higher speed (with a higher gearing reduction), or a larger motor with more stator poles with a more direct gearing? (Assume gear friction loss is identical)

&amp;#x200B;

If also, there were 2 identical motors, one being of a bigger diameter, but similar in every other way (identical kV, # of stator and magnet poles), one was capable of dissipating 5kW at a certain voltage, and the bigger one was capable of dissipating 8kW (theoretical). If both motors were installed on identical vehicles cruising along, with the speed controller feeding 2kW to the motor, would one motor have more mechanical energy output than the other? Would the bigger motor have more torque than the smaller diameter motor due to a longer moment arm from motor axle to the stator air gap? Even though both motors are being fed identical voltage/current?

&amp;#x200B;

I read that some BLDC motors have peak efficiency near the maximum power input, is this simply by design or a characteristic of all brushless motors, or false information?

25,[Orientation] Help in getting a direction on which industry to focus.,1546880577,"Hello there,

&amp;#x200B;

I would like help in guidance in which direction should I focus on to get a job that fit my goals. For this, I'll do a quick briefing on me and my qualification/experience in hope to receive a more accurate help.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27yo now, Brazilian, concluded BS in ME in Jul/2015, MS in ME in July/2018 (with an academic approach), currently a student in an MSc in ME in Hungary(started in Aug/ 2018 with an industrial/practical approach).   


My experiences are:

\- 2 years of internship in the engineering/maintenance and planning divisions in a multinational company of oil and gas segment in Brazil. 

\- 1,5 years (intership+contract) in the engineering/energy department of the Rio2016 Olympic games

\- 1 year in a credit recovery company, managing administrative tasks and similar.

\- I've others of minor importance that might not be relevant to the engineering field.

&amp;#x200B;

What are my career goals?

\- Work within a technical department where I could design mechanical engineering solution: Oil &amp; Gas Machines/aerospace parts/automotive parts/structural analysis and similar fields (sound generic but in Brazil, departments like this were pretty rare and employed a small number of people, most of the time you became a manager and  in fact do not use any engineering knowledge).

\- Be able to build a career inside the company, starting from draftsman and capable to achieve a project manager position.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my questions are:

\- Am I being a ""dreamer"" trying to search for such a job?

\- This path is worth going to? Or should I focus on a more generic/required function nowadays?

\- What companies (small or big ones) can be a good start point for this?

\- Are there any suggestions on a career program from a company you know that would be a good opportunity?

&amp;#x200B;

This chance that I got to come from Brazil to Hungary to study is the chance of my life until now, I don't want to waste it.

Here in Europe, I see I can get shot in this, but if I'm being a dreamer, I want to know early to learn how to play the game and win as much as I can.

I’ll spare you of the gruesome details of that situations.  In short, I needed to drop a course that set back my track to graduate.  The school is refusing to give me financial aid for the additional time I need to finish the degree.


They gave me an alternative to complete an Applied Science in Chemical Engineering B.S.  This degree requires fewer courses, and from my understanding, I cannot pursue my PE with this degree.  


I just wanted to ask other engineers, how does this impact my career outlook down the line? I did some research, and I saw that only about 20% of ChemE’s pursue a PE.  


Also, are employers going to turn their nose up at an “Applied Science in Chemical Engineering” degree?


I’m not exactly sure what career path I’d like to follow, but I’m interested in manufacturing engineering, and anything to do with environmental safety (I have a B.A in Environmental Science).

33,Temperature unit conversion driving me crazy...,1546867868,"Hi there,

Currently developing a geoscience web app where I need to do some conversion between temperature gradients.  
I want to build a table that will convert from a source unit to a destination unit and will always use SI unit as intermediate calculation.  
Example: convert from degC/m to degF/ft will first go from degC/m to K/m and then K/m to degF/ft.

I ran into the following units in oil&amp;gas research paper:

\- degC/m

\- degC/100 m

\- degC/ft

\- degC/100 ft  


Now, what's driving me crazy is when I try to convert 1 degC/100m to K/m, I get ""(1+273,15)/100"" = **2,7415 K/m**. Is it correct? This looks OK to me.  
With my spreadsheet, I then try to convert 0,01 degC/m to K/m.  
For me, **1 degC/100m === 0,01 degC/m** but when doing my computation:  
0.01 degC/m = ""(0.01 + 273,15) K/m"" = **273,16 K/m**  


Now, if **1 degC/100m &amp; 0,01 degC/m** are indeed the same, I end up with: 2,7415 K/m == 273,16 K/m...

43,Graduate-ish Mechatronics Engineer - concerned about being mentored,1546823468,"Hello all,

I'm an aspirant graduate engineer. What do I mean by that?

To keep it short, each year, engineers need to finish a practicum paper that involves getting a job. At the end of our studies, we need about 900 hours in total.

I've been slack and stupid, and now I'm in this situation where it's the new year, I need 120 hours left to graduate, and graduation occurs in may. 

However, I'm not sure how to approach this. I'm asking friends, family of friends and classmates if they know of any jobs and just plain old applying online, but I'm not sure if I should apply for a ""proper"" graduate job (I *need* to be mentored), or go for an internship or a part-time job in an unrelated field.

My reasoning is that since I'm technically not a graduate (I've passed all my other papers however), that affects my chances for applying for full time graduate roles. Then again, 120 hours is simply, what? three 40 hour weeks? Would an employer be understanding? How could I put that in my cover letter/CV?

Or should I aim lower and go for something part time, just to fill out my CV and write off those hours?

53,Fixing that feeling of being left behind in career,1546806998,"Hi r/askengineers,

I'm an engineer in my mid-30s.  I graduated just before the Great Recession and entered into the auto industry.  For various reasons (recession and others) I made slow progress during the early years of my career.

In 2011, I moved to a large Aerospace and Defense company. It was a great decision (better pay/benefits, closer to family).  Like clockwork, every ~2 years I've had a ""hard"" or ""soft"" promotion -- beginning as an individual contributor and now leading a team of engineers.  I'm often pulled into high-profile projects by management, was nominated for a leadership development program last year, and consistently earn strong performance reviews.  Outside work, I sit on the diversity council of a national STEM non-profit.

That being said, there's been several times over the past year where other peers were poached by executives for high-profile positions. Given the slow progress in the beginning of my career, I can't help but feel I need to make up for lost time.  Missing out on promotions has me feeling left behind, and asking the question ""Why not me?""

To address those feelings, I reached out to management, mentors, and a career coach for constructive feedback and received the following:

1) The career coach from the leadership program said in my formal communication, I need to better connect with my audience. My passion doesn't come through.  OTOH hand, in everyday  situations, I need to come out of my shell.  I'm an introvert, so I understand the first half of that is my weakness, and I need to practice at public speaking.  The second half I feel is emotional baggage as a gay guy in engineering. I have good relationships with coworkers but am reluctant to share my personal life with most.  My mentor echoed he knows me well professionally, but doesn't know much about my personal life.  Early in my career in the auto industry, a senior-level engineer learned from coworkers I'm gay, and did whatever he could to make my life difficult.  Management was reluctant to address the issue, so I left for my current company.  My current company in aerospace better supports diversity and inclusion. But that past experience has me cautious on ""coming out"" at work.  I only come out to coworkers who I'm also friends with outside of work.

2) An executive said my name comes up often in talent planning discussions.  His advice was I excel at the wide variety of roles and projects management throws at me, but I should pick one thing and become well known for it.

The feedback was very meaningful. But I'm struggling to translate it into tangible action.  I'm not sure how to address the first piece given the walls I put up after my earlier experiences.  I don't know any LGBT mentors in the company who can provide guidance.  The second piece is less clear cut.  I'm a ""go to"" person in my dept, so I'm thrown a wide variety of tasks.  I'm try my best at them, because I have high expectations for my work.  Lately, I've tried to be more picky and only take assignments aligning with my goal of being promoted to management/leadership.  But beyond that, what else can I do?

Long story short: I graduated from a reputable school with a high GPA, top 10%, several internships, took part of a technical student team (formula student), some volunteering experience, speak 3 languages, have certificates in a few softwares relevant to my discipline, you get the idea.

I thought I did everything right and that recruiters would welcome me with open arms, having found the candidate they've long waited for. Spoiler alert: I couldn't be more wrong.

I discovered that I'm not so special after all. Maybe what I thought were my strong points were just another irrelevant line on my resume for recruiters,after all, they went through hundreds of resumes before mine and hundreds after it.

And add to that the sheer amount of people who apply for each job, some with previous experience that's worth more than whatever any new graduate can bring. And no body has time to sift through hundreds of applications trying to find the most perfect candidate to fill the position, if they find someone suitable who meets the requirements of the job they will hire him, why go through all the other candidates ? and that's not wrong and I can understand their point.

But what I couldn't understand was the amount of nepotism, favoritism, connections and networking required to even get the recruiters to look at your resume.

To top it all, you get that disheartening feeling when someone asks you about your job and you tell them that you haven't found a job yet and it gets awkward for both sides. And also seeing your colleagues get hired and looking back at my ""perfect recipe"", some of them had low GPAs, others stayed in the comfort of their homes or had fun between semesters and didn't have internships, others barely knew anything about the course materials and barely passed every semester. They just knew the right person or sent in their application at just the right moment, or maybe my whole ""perfect recipe"" doesn't even translate to the real world.

And if I look back to see what I could've done differently, I can't find anything, I did my best but apparently that wasn't enough.

63,Would starting as a technician hurt my career?,1546790413,"I'm interested in going into semiconductor work.



 A job as a research technician is open, which I think I'd learn a shit ton from and get paid at least fairly well. The idea would be to work it for 1-1.5 years, go to school part time, and start applying to Engineering positions in the same company when I feel things are stale.  Maybe I'd spend 2.5 years in this company- leaving when I finish my masters. 



I feel like this background - masters, and experience with photolithography, etching, characterization- could slingshot me into great grad schools and educate me for engineering work as a process engineer or semiconductor researcher at a lot of places.

64,What engineering concepts will most people refuse to believe?,1546789872,"Hi, I am starting to write a non-fiction book, whereby I attempt to provide convincing rebuttal to 100 science and engineering concepts which almost everybody will initially not believe. That is, I want to get the reader to change their mind 100 times in one book. Some of this will be via reviewing the most popular misconceptions. And some of it will be new knowledge that people will initially think ""that can't be true"".

Can you think of any theories, concepts, laws which people wont believe upon hearing, or are already 'ubiquitous misconceptions'?
[Here's the physics thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/abyc48/what_specific_physics_concepts_will_most_people/). Again, not just looking for interesting facts; looking for true things that most regular people will first believe aren't true.

Here are a few ideas for example related to engineering:

&gt; To catch up with a space station in orbit, a satellite firing rockets prograde will move further away. It will initially have to fire its engines retrograde to drop to a lower orbit.

&gt; It takes more specific energy to get to the sun than to the far planets. You do not 'fall in' at all like one would expect.

&gt; Supersonic diverging nozzles make flow go faster.

&gt; Subsonic pipe restrictions make velocity go up but pressure go down.

&gt; If you had a house with freezing outside air temperature, and access to a big hot rock, in principle you would be better off using the rock to run a heat pump to move heat from the outside cold air to the warm inside of the house.

&gt; An open fridge will make a room hotter.

&gt; A helicopter pitching forward will have to increase its relative lift to the side, not at the back of the rotor. The FAA says it's at 90 degrees as one would expect from dynamics (but there is some debate about whether it is less than 90).

&gt; If you could shrink to the scale of a bacterium and physically be fine, you wouldn't be able to swim in water. It'll be like super thick honey.

&gt; An ant scaled to a human would be not be able to carry any weight (let alone 50 times). It would collapse and die, as stresses are carried through an area, and volume grows faster than area.

I haven't done any club activities because I was too busy trying to maintain my gpa (3.7) and my university only has two clubs (SAE baja and Concrete Tobaggon). I tried joining SAE baja to work on the design team, but the guy who ran it pretty much just threw me to the wolves without any kind of training or preliminary insight and I realized that it would be a tremendous time commitment to learn everything on my own with no help which would absolutely reck my gpa. I know he failed 3/4 of his midterms this semester because all he does is SAE baja. 

I haven't had any internships or coops which was definitely my fault. I've worked as a painter and maintenance but that's it and neither of these jobs were all that technical. 

I keep hearing how networking is so important but I struggle just to make friends, let alone build a network of people around me. Super shy and awkward and don't have a lot of family contacts. I only have one mechanical engineering contact that I can look to for an internship this summer and am definitely going to try and get it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have heard that there are different pavement grading methods. One that is now used in the US to my knowledge is Performance grading system which indicates the range of temperatures in which the binder used to the pavement, provides the requirements regarding pavement deformations.

My question is : What contents of the binder make the difference in the temperature range, in which it will be the most effective. Is it just the proportion of the basic contents like oils, resin, asphaltenes or are there any more specific modification being made to the structure?

I tried looking of some type of specifications which would describe the contents to each category , but I have only found the requirements regarding the deformations.

I’ll set up the bulk of the modeling framework and have super detailed step by step instructions with how to set everything up, which can definitely simplified to be appropriate for a middle schooler.

0,2 months into my engineering job and I feel like I’m not getting it. I feel a little worried. How long is it going to take for me to learn the job?,1546704068,"So just like the title says. Started my engineer job with a pretty big company about 2 months ago but I feel like it’s taking me a little long to learn it.

I am also surprised that working for a Fortune 500 company they don’t have any structured training, I was just thrown into the fire and told to ask questions if I have any.

I know how to do most of the routine work that is straight forward but when it comes to actually troubleshooting a problem and solving it I don’t know how to go about it. Troubleshooting is a huge part of the job.

I really like the people I work with and culture in general so I really want to do well at this job.

So I'm from Norway ( well born I Liberia but raised in norway). I moved to the United kingdom after graduating with a MSc in ME with a very high expectation of landing any job I wanted. 

However after the first couple of weeks I realised the British pretty much call anyone an engineer. Now i majored in Structural mechanics and as such could work in many fields, but most recruiters didn't know what I could do so I ended up taking an engineering assistant role planning and organising maintenance activities for a food manufacturing company. 

Since then every role I've been headhunted for has been engineering maintenance roles and the pay is always below average. Now guys with a high school diploma and some ""hands on skills"" or NVQ are also called engineers (it's almost like a disdain for degree qualified engineers ) which would be unheard of in Scandinavia, but hey I don't make the rules. 

I interviewed for a structural simulation analyst role recently but I soon realised my current role wasn't relevant.

In articles, they mentioned that the wifi/radio signals travel as fast as light’s speed.

So with a simple server and client, I send the current time on the server to the client and on the client side I deduct the current time on the client from the server sent time. So I can get the t for the above formula. 

The deducting time from each other will give me the result of 45000 sometimes even larger result.

d = 300,000,000 m/s * 0.000045 s
d = 13,500 m??? What? the test ran in the same machine that means there is no wifi traveling distance so I expect to be faster than the wifi connects on 2 different computer. But this result shows me completely wrong which I'm sure if I test it on 2 RPIs on the Wifi connection, the result will be even more wrong. 

Yes, I'm sure that there is some wasted time on each hardware from the wifi antenna all the way to the CPU to read my program. But how can I implement the proper calculation to get an almost realistic result?

Usually, the noise rises over a one or two of seconds and then fades away again in a similar fashion.


Doesn't seem to be happening in a predictable cycle, so I think it's probably not just simply a standing wave, right? Could it be caused by small variations in the power coming from the wall causing the motor to change speed and hit the resonance frequency of the grill?

We argue about this a lot at work. I work in aerospace, so highly complicated systems of assemblies and a large focus on manufacturing and assembly.

We do not control our bills of materials to drawing rev letter (revving up a sub component is invisible to the higher level assembly) , nor do we have any way of determining what rev letter a part in stock is built to. Does this seem odd to you?

We end up rolling part numbers constantly, which kind of creates a confusing mess. We also cannot update bills of materials for assemblies without releasing a new drawing (rev letter or new part number) 

My thought would be that all parts just must be made to the latest rev letter, and any parts in stock must be upgraded to the latest rev. If a part physically cannot be upgraded, then the part number must be rolled (assuming you have made parts in service somewhere.)

42,Creating pressure in a fuel tank,1546620924,"Have found many helpful answers here before while ghosting, but please remove if this is not appropriate for the sub. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I have several small fuel tanks for a racing go kart. Each tank has a fuel line that picks up fuel, feeds out of the tank and into the carburetor of a racing go kart engine. Each tank also has a vent line for relieving pressure  / building pressure to push fluid into the line when first installed. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Odd design**: lines are secured on the top of a few tank by feeding the line into the tank and screwing down the cap down on a threaded plastic stub on the top of the tank. Think of screwing a plastic cap back onto a plastic Dasani water bottle.  Because of the water-bottle-and-cap design, the threaded plastic stub often breaks off of the fuel tank after a few uses, leaving a flat surface on the top of the tank, and the fuel line and no longer be secured. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Strange Behavior**: . The most common solution among mechanics and racers and mechanics is to... throw away the fuel tank. I'm 100% guilty of this behavior, and we all own back-up fuel tanks.

Before I order this motor, however, I have some things to decide upon.  Firstly, I will try to explain part of my project here:

My project uses the input from an arm to spin a gear, which (at some given ratio) outputs into another gear, which finally transfers the power into a motor.  Right now, the reason I've chosen this model is that A) it has screw-in mounts and plenty of dimensions, which makes my CAD modelling easier and B) a variety of RPM's to choose from.  However, I have to decide how much of the gear ratio I want to be in the gears versus the motor itself.  If you look at the page for the motor itself, there are several RPM's to choose from, which (from what I understand) changes the gear ratio, meaning less 3D printing if I choose the right one.

I'm thinking now that the torques are going to have to be pretty high on the motor's end, so even though there's a D-shaft on it I'm unsure how effective it will be at spinning without breaking the gear.  For around 30 dollars I can buy some universal mounts that ensure that it fits instead of relying on *just* that small D-shaft; would it be worth it to purchase these?  The arm itself will be able to apply substantial torque, however it will only spin to around 120 degrees at a max; in its real application, it will be probably going between 30 and 60 degrees, and will only go back and forth every 2-5 seconds.  I don't need continuous generation, but I want each up and down motion from the arm to create at least small voltages at the motor.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR version: how should I go about choosing an RPM on a DC (brushed) motor and a gear ratio to generate power when my input is high torque and very low RPM?",AskEngineers,False,StuffyMcStuffins,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aciyc5/using_motors_as_generators/
48,The future of Mechanical Engineering. Is it still in demand as it was before?,1546609634,"Hi everyone, I am a senior m.e. student and nowadays I sort of feel like my major's importance hit the bottom. 

Back then, mechanical engineering meant everything but by the time new technologies came up and took over mechanical systems. A  great example is in aviation; aircrafts had no electronics when they first came up, it was almost completely mechanical from top to the bottom but then fly-by-wire got involved and now we have got a whole new term as ""avionics"".

Few days ago, I was going through some job positions at Lockheed Martin and Mercedes and more than M.E. they were looking for software or electronic engineers. 

Electronic and software related industries are dominating the entire market. Energy and automotive companies used to be in the top 10 in company rankings but now this list is filled by companies like amazon, google, apple and so on. 

I know as a M.E. I can look into robotics or software related things but this does not change the fact that m.e. is going down. I am definetely not saying m.e. is not important but even the most outstanding energy-automotive-aviation companies look for as many IT engineers as they do for M.E. This directly affects our salaries as well, among my friends, I hear some offers coming from abroad to software engineers but can't say the same for mechanical engineers.

So in terms of engineer numbers, do you think mechanical engineering is over-supplied? Future does not seem bright to me :( More supply than demand.

49,Was taking that internship a mistake?,1546607889,"Last summer I finished my BSc in Mechanical Engineering (focus on energy/process engineering) with good marks at a very renowned university. I decided to take a year off from studying before starting my master program to do an internship in the hopes of having it easier getting a job after graduating.

After getting rejections from multiple companies I felt quite stressed and ended up taking the first internship I was offered. I joined a team of technical engineers at a huge pharmaceutical company. Their job is to keep the production running and repare the machines to reduce down time. My part is to help them out with paper work and to support some projects concerning logistics. 

I am 2 months in now (4 more to go) and I really don't know how I should feel about the internship. On the one hand I have really nice coworkers and I get on very well with my boss, the pay is ok and I'm kind of in the spirit of ""c'mon dude it'll be over in a couple of months.""
On the other hand, the things I do here are ridiculously simple, I cannot use anything I learned in my studies and I'm quite bored at some point every single day. My life as a student was surely more stressfull but boy I wish I could go back to doing something interesting and intelectually challenging from time to time.

It seems like I'm wasting my leap year. I wanted to do an internship to have some working experience for future positions but if I'm just sitting around here all day am I the job really valuable for my future career?

I am a high school senior and have already committed to majoring in environmental engineering at the university of toledo (go rockets!) and i’m terrified to entering the workforce for a couple of reasons.

1) lack of diversity 

I’m worried about being forced into a workplace without any other people of color and with next to no women. if any other engineers can share their workplace experiences would be great. I’m worried about a bunch passive aggressive bullshit from my coworkers about my race/gender. 

2) being able to find a job in the first place

I don’t even know if i’m going to be able to find a job. Environmental Engineering isn’t a popular major, and the only jobs I can find are government jobs or like boeing which i’ve heard is hard to get a job at.

90,28m Considering career change and going back to school for ME degree?,1546539755,"Hey everyone. Posted a similar post in r/engineeringstudents and was advised to post here as well.

Looking for some guidance from some of you going through an engineering program, from those of you who have already graduated and working in your field, or from anyone who went back to school for engineering as an older age. I'm strongly considering going back to school to become a Mechanical Engineer because i don't get any fulfillment from my current career but I'm unsure if its the right path for me to take.

Here is some background of my self that I hope is relevant. (Sorry for all the wall of text!)

I've always been interested in building/creating/designing things. It was Legos, Kinects, Transformers, Gundam models, drawing, etcs when I was younger.  As I got older my interests turned into building go-peds (taking apart the little 2-stroke motors and learning how they worked), modifying cars, dirt bikes,etc. Always been interested in how things operate and work. After high school I learned to weld and started to restore and build old motorcycles with my farther and currently building up a 1967 Mustang. I've always been a very hands on person and really enjoy being creative. I like using that creativity to solve problems or to make a motorcycle part look the way I want it to aesthetically.  

I wasn't the most studious kid, pretty average gpa through out grade school. I never really enjoyed math. This may have been because I never put much effort into learning it. It was hard for me to see the point in remembering different equations when I didn't think id ever put it to use later in life. Now I wish i had put more effort. Overall I’d say I’m more of a practical problem solver vs theoretical at this point. 

After high school I had a hard time deciding what i wanted to study in college and do as a career. So I started taking classes at a local community college while trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I jumped around a lot but ended up getting my EMT and wanting to be a Firefighter. I decided to pursue that on the side while i was getting a bachelors since I had already finished a lot of my general ed. classes. I ended up just picking a degree i thought i'd like and not one that had the best job opportunities ( The fire departments don't really care what you major in, you get an education salary bonus either way). 

So I picked a degree in Film Production and graduated summer of 2017. I enjoyed it and was good at it. It was an outlet for me to create and build things i was visualizing, just with different tools then I was use to. I enjoyed it enough to the point where i was considering trying to become a film director of cinematographer but its an unstable, risky career path that deterred me. I know people who have been stuck at the bottom of the industry as a PA for years and didn't want to be that person at 30 years old. 

Fast forward shortly after I graduated in 2017, and I ended up injuring my back and knee. Firefighting was not an option for me any more. So I started to look at a plan B within the fire department and eventually took Fire Prevention classes and got my Fire Inspector class's done with and an Associated degree in Fire Prevention. Shortly after I got hired on by my local fire department as a Fire Inspector and have been working there for the last 4 months.

So now we are at present day and I don't feel happy with where i'm at. On paper I feel like I should be.

The pros of my job.

* I'm getting 100% medical benefits and great dental and vision benefits. 
* Set up for a great pension and 457b
* Working a 9/80 schedule (get 2 Fridays off a month),
* Starting out at approx 70k/ year and will Cap out at approx. 110k/year in my current position as an Inspector.
* The job is pretty laid back, pretty much get paid to drive around while listening to music and inspect different occupancies and facilities and write correction notices.
* It's pretty low stress, besides dealing with people who are upset at me or don't want me to be there. 
* Co-workers are pretty nice 
* My boss is laid back and pretty much just lets me do my thing and stays out of my work.
* I always get off at 5pm and work doesn't follow me home after I leave.
* Opportunity in the future to promote to Assistant Fire Marshal, Deputy Fire Marshal or Assistant Chief Fire Marshal higher making anywhere from 140k-250k a year.

Bu I don't feel engaged with what I do and I don't feel like I get any fulfillment out of my job. I really don't have any interest in Fire Prevention and Fire code. I'm always counting down the days till my days off. I find myself hitting snooze every morning more and more not wanting to get out of bed to go to work. Even though the retirement is good, its depressing to think that I'd have to do this for another 39 years to see it. I really don’t have any interest in completing my work besides it being “my job”. I want to find something that I want to complete and work on because I enjoy it. I've been trying to hone in on what i'm good at and what I really enjoy doing and feel as if i'd be much happier being able to design and build things while being creative. 

A pretty local college allows for students to get a secondary bachelorette degree in an Engineer field. Im strongly considering going back to school and pursing a ME degree because it seems like it would allow me to use the building, designing, and creative skills I have and enjoy using. I'm pretty far behind in math and science classes though so I just signed up for a pre-calc class at a community college to start on this path. I'd also say that physics interests me ( like finding out how much force was in a punch, or how much force a structure can take till it fails. Material science also seems interesting and I like learning about the different mechanical proprieties of metals like tensile, shear, and compression strengths and which metals are stronger then others and what they are best suited for. 

Am I crazy?  Does ME seem like its a good fit for me? Possibly design engineering or prototyping seemed interesting to me ( Industrial Design caught my eye too). From the response from my other post and research I have done I’m a little worried that being a mechanical engineer is not has hands on with building and creating as id hope. I don’t mind creating with computer software but I’d like to eventually be able to see and test my design in the real world. 

Working on the design and structure of a prosthetic/bionic arm so it can handle the forces applied to it sounds awesome. Or designing/engineering aftermarket car/motorcycle parts sounds great too.

The career change is not about salary. I just really want fulfillment out of my career. Any advice would be appreciated. 

 TLDR: New Fire Inspector does not get fulfillment from job. Likes to visualize, build, design and create things. Has not done math or science for 4 years. Considering Mechanical Engineering.

We  have a linear mechanism which needs to move around 0.4m/s for a very short time and we thought ball screw may be a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this means that most ball screws we found which have 5mm pitch needs to turn with 5000rpm or more.

Many producers indicated that this speed may be too much.

&amp;#x200B;

We checked for resonance limits and DN standarts and realized while we have no problem with resonance, DN standarts put us on range of 3500 rpm, at best.

&amp;#x200B;

Out budget for ball screw is at best around $350, maybe.

What is the risk if we take a 3500 rpm MAX ball screw and try to turn it around 5000 rpm for an instant? Or, is it possible to find a suitable ball screw at this price range?

98,Engineering Opportunities after the military?,1546528193,"Hello all, 

I hope that I am in the right place to ask this so...

I am going to try and ask without sounding like a moron and being laughed out of the room.

Short paraphrasing of only my military history:

I currently have 6 years of Air Force experience as a Space Systems Operator. I have operated SATCOM satellites up until November when I was PCS'd. Taskings ranging from building burn plans for manual Delta V's, completing trending and analysis scans where I would look through a day/week/month/quarters worth of data to see if there was anything to be concerned about, anomaly troubleshooting (at times 8 or so hours in a single sitting), working scripts within live systems to work differently, you can probably see where this is going. I have even worked launch and early orbit operations at Boeing facilities (and everything included in that fun, not sarcastic, I LOVED it). 

And of course everything else that comes with the whole, I'm Air Force thing. I've trained, evaluated, worked program management for simulators/emulators, worked QC type stuff, blah blah.

And to throw this in, I do have a TS SCI, Diploma in Drafting Technologies, and almost have my CCAF in my career field.

&amp;#x200B;

That was the short and skinny so on to my question.

What sort of ""cool"" work can I get into if i decided to get out in a few years? I want an engineering job without the degree to be upfront about it. I do not like normal, I want the jobs that no one knows about.

I can and have done engineering level work so I feel as if not having a degree should not limit my opportunities but I know there are respective areas that it does. I am very motivated to learn and I can pickup anything and have it down very quickly. I am a very technical person but I ""hate"" school. I am also a stickler for perfection, some would call it OCD I suppose.

I'm not too concerned about money, I just want to enjoy what I do.

Another team refuses to email me back, even after my boss told me that he would ask them to give me some training. He replied to my boss that he doesn't have time to help me.

I think the biggest problem is I have absolutely no experience with what I'm working with, no one to show me where to begin, no one to even speak to at work (besides my boss when he is available), I'm completely clueless and running around like a mad cow reading relevant research articles all day everyday and its just straining my eyes and giving me a headache.

28,Marketing vs. engineering – total reboot at age 35?,1546465905,"TL;DR - At age 35 I consider to forget about my career in marketing and start a new study from scratch.

Hey everyone,

35-year-old guy here seeking a bit of career advice for a rather extreme step in my somehow solid yet not impressive career. I have about 10 years of experience in digital marketing, content strategy, and public relations and hold a bachelor degree in media economics and a masters in public affairs. My last position was senior consultant for marketing communications in a small consultancy (around 50 employees). Before that, I worked for an agency managing a small marketing team of five and working on international projects.

The thing is that I really got fed up with everything marketing-like. I just don't want to do it anymore and, in retrospective, I can't even explain myself how I could land in marketing/communications given that I'm super introvert and socially awkward. Even though I managed to compensate in professional life, it tears me apart. Most aspects of the job / the field are opposing my nature. Realizing this was like waking up in a big nightmare, realizing there's no way out. But if I recapitulate objectively, I somehow know how this has happened as I never really spend much effort on figuring out what I really want back in the days. I just always took the first somehow acceptable option: my major, my first job, whatever. By now I tried to focus on the tasks and routines I hate least and started a freelance business for content writing. It's going quite well but it's nowhere near being fulfilling or being something I can actually imagine being proud of.

The thing is now that I spend years of pondering over what I *really* would have wanted to do and where my heart would have led me if I had allowed it, I am relatively sure that I would love to work in natural sciences or in an engineering field. But both my academic and my professional background couldn't be less appropriate to pursue such a career path. Basically, it would need me to start from scratch, enroll in a bachelor study and go all the way again.

I am from Germany, so tuition or debt isn't really a problem. Yet I am afraid to take such a step as my career choices have obviously not been the best so far… So I am looking for any advice and help I can get.

This is my first job (Been at if for a year), and quite frankly I don't like it. This is not what I was expecting engineering to be (It sounds stupid to say that, but this is what happened to me). There seems to be very little flexibility, so much time taken up by work, and the work seems to be very repetitive and not imaginative. I mean I like engineering If for example I were to design my own cool little product or something. But not working in a company, not being a bolt in a machine.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a health problem (Like chronic fatigue or something I don't want to say more) so I feel like I have lost so much for this because whatever little energy I had I would use it to survive in my studies. So I felt like I have never had any time for my own (Less now since I have started working). And I'm finding out there are other things that I would like to work on a lot but cannot because of my work (Like sports). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I was thinking after maybe half a year (After getting my papers), I'm thinking of quitting, maybe taking a part time job, 2 days a week, and using the rest of the time to for example increase my skills in stuff I like. So sport, math and physics, maybe try designing my own product, increasing my skills in engineering by doing small projects that I am into (This may sound weird but we didn't have small projects and stuff in my university). Coding small mobile apps. And try and make a profit from all the above.

Because I can never be happy in a 9 to 5 job.

My question is first do you have any advice? What do you think about what I am saying?

Second and this is the important one: There is the obvious risk of me running out of money and needing go back in the work force. Would I be able to get back in the workforce or would I be stuck without a job after doing this?

I guess, my question is, would it have been possible to complete the final 500+ foot design without this tensioning on the stones to resist wind forces? Are they truly doing this from necessity to resist wind loads, or is this actually more of a method to decrease construction time, on-site labor, and therefore costs?

43,Using a Motor as a Generator,1546443281," 

I have a school project that I'm working on which requires me to use a motor to generate electricity. The mechanism I'm using is going to have a gear train that ultimately connects to the motor, in a fashion which will be spinning back and forth (clockwise and then counter clockwise). I've gotten a preliminary design on paper and even some basic CAD models, but there's still several things that I need to currently figure out.

Firstly, I need to know what motor I should use. Should it be AC or DC? From the little knowledge I've yet been able to gather, DC is easier while AC more effective. The problem is, the mechanism that spins the gears will cause the gears to spin in *both* directions, meaning there will automatically be reverse flow, which makes me think it might be better to use AC. The thing is, I'm going to need to design some sort of circuitry to make it work, and though I'm great at taking an image of a circuit and tweaking it to be my own, I'm not so experienced in figuring out the circuits I need and how to make them. Basically, I'm not the best electrical engineer.

Next, I have to connect the motor itself to the mechanism. These gears are going to be 3D printed; should I try to use a smooth shaft motor and drill a hole into the center of the final gear and shimmy it in there, or have a motor that has a specially designed shaft that can fit more solidly? I think there's going to be decently high torques, so I have no idea how much I should prepare for that. I also need to figure out how to get this power and use it in some manner. Should I use diodes in order to restrict the ultimate AC flow to one direction, or will that cause resistance when we want to rotate the gears opposite to the flow?

I have a decent amount of freedom here, but I want to be able to finish the CAD models and start the process of printing them within then next week; my final deadline for a basic functioning model is the 20th. During the coming weeks, I want to be able to get the motor and circuit functioning to the point it can charge a capacitor (its discharge being unimportant). How should I go about this? I don't simply want to have an answer handed to me, but I am completely new in this field of electrical generation and even mechanical engineering (at least in regards to 3D printing and such); having knowledgeable people help me would be great.

I think there's going to be decently high torques, so I have no idea how much I should prepare for that.  I also need to figure out how to get this power and use it in some manner.  Should I use diodes in order to restrict the ultimate AC flow to one direction, or will that cause resistance when we want to rotate the gears opposite to the flow?

I have a decent amount of freedom here, but I want to be able to finish the CAD models and start the process of printing them within then next week; my final deadline for a basic functioning model is the 20th.  During the coming weeks, I want to be able to get the motor and circuit functioning to the point it can charge a capacitor (its discharge being unimportant).  How should I go about this?

45,Should I continue grad school if I want to switch companies?,1546440765,"I’m currently enrolled in Hopkins Engineering for Professionals program to get a Masters in Mechanical Engineering. I take classes at night and online, and my company is paying for it entirely. I have to stay for two years after each class payment or I have to pay back the money for classes. Right now I’ve finished 3 out of the 10 required classes for my degree.
 
My only issue is that I’m not a huge fan of the company I’m working for. It’s a very large defense company, and I honestly kind of hate the defense industry and working at such a large company. I’d like to make the switch to a new job, so I’m unsure if I should continue pursuing a masters, especially if I know I likely won’t finish it while still at this company?
 
Should I suck it up and work the 5ish years here for me to pay off the masters? Is it better to stop after the 3 classes so that if I have to pay it back, I only have to pay back about 12K? Is there any chance a new company may offer to pay back the class amount and fund my continued pursuit of the masters?

Hi, high school senior here. I am having a hard time knowing if I am making the right choice on career paths. I currently am applying to schools for civil engineering, but really like the idea of computer engineering.

Things I like about civil engineering are:

* Management abilities. I think being able to lead projects is very cool, and something I can see myself being good at.
* Job opportunities. There are many job opportunities for civil engineers across the U.S., meaning I shouldn't have too much problem finding a position in a general area.
* Architecture. I enjoy building things. Lego was a large part of my childhood, haha.

However, I come from a relatively limited background in terms of educational opportunities/being able to experience different professions. My school is small and only offers one ""computers"" class (AP Computer Science Principles), which I really enjoy. I also really enjoy learning about technology/computers (specifically cell phones). I am strongly considering a career in computer engineering rather than civil engineering. I get straight A's in my classes (calculus, chemistry, physics are main STEM classes I've taken/am taking) and should be valedictorian as long as I keep my grades where they're at now, so I am not too worried about the mathematics being too difficult. What I do worry about:

* Current knowledge. I don't know *that* much about computers/hardware. I know what I have learned from watching YouTube and reading about many tech products, but I feel like I need to have built a PC or coded something intense to go into a career in computer engineering.
* Job opportunities. I do not want to go into a career where I'll be geo locked to only a few places due to job openings. I would like to be able to have a family that I can be home with a reasonable amount. Is working from home/remote location realistic/common?

Long story short, I want to go into computer engineering. I am really interested in the hardware components of computers. I just worry about my current knowledge going in, and not having enough exposure to computers/coding/etc. prior to going into university. I don't want to be behind before I even start. Then again, it's not like I know a ton about bridges or structures... After all, you do go to school expecting to learn a subject, not being expected to already know it.

74,"Where do the ""smart"" engineers end up?",1546364310,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Before anything, I want to say that I apologize if this post comes off as bragging - that is not my intent. I'm close to graduating with my degree in EE and I'm feeling an immense amount of (external and self imposed) pressure to pursue something beyond ""just a job."" I've picked up most of the EE coursework fairly quickly and haven't really had to devote more than a few hours a week to my classes to get A's. (Most of my free time goes to student clubs/social life).

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm close to graduating, I'm having a lot of people around me pushing me to pursue things beyond ""just a job."" I've had professors, classmates, and even my freaking therapist tell me that I ""have more to offer"" than just accepting the cushy job I have for a defense contractor. I've always wanted to go into space/aerospace and am okay accepting the job and enjoying life. But, I can't help but wonder if there's more I can do? For what it's worth, I know there's tons more about EE I want to learn (controls, electronics, systems/DSP, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I assume most engineers need to choose between industry and research/academia? Personally, I don't know how I feel about academia, but I do know there's a lot more topics in EE I really want to learn more about. I spend a lot of time reading about some of the coursework offered in graduate programs/other undergraduate programs and it seems like things I'd really freaking enjoy. But at the same time, it seems daunting to do a complete shift and focus on academia. Up until this point, my main focus has been making myself attractive to industry, not to academia.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had some offers from NASA centers, but honestly never seriously considered them due to the extreme lack of pay. (Pay for the pathways program was \~50% of the defense pay; pay for the summer programs was \~70%). However, the truth is that due to some incredibly fortunate circumstances, I'm in a position where I don't need to make a lot of money to live comfortably. The more I think about all this, the more I want to work on more research/experimental aerospace work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess if I had to sum up my concerns in one question, it'd be: will an applicant with an attractive ""industry"" resume have difficulty pursuing a higher education in engineering? For reference, I have a \~3.95, am the lead engineer for a few student clubs, and have multiple internships with (on-campus, unpublished) labs and with one of  the ""big"" defense contractors. I'm just feeling a bit lost and unsure of the path I want to take.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I want to emphasize that I KNOW I THAT I KNOW NOTHING. I don't act like god's gift to the world at my internships, classes, or clubs. If anything, at my work everyone knew me as ""the intern"" who was always asking questions, not answering them.

81,Where should my search begin when I have confusion to get clear answers on basic items?,1546349749,"So, I understand that I have to learn a lot to be proficient. And I have a lot to read myself (college was not too helpful) But I feel like I am starting to read from wrong part - either too difficult or too shallow. For example: I knew basics about springs but when I tested a spring in lab, the result confused me because stiffness wasn't about linear. It turned out that the spring was in pretension which often happens (it seems) in extension spring. So it is about small details and concepts that I know I lack which most resources seems to not include. And I want to build up a solid foundation.

So if I were to begin search (please don't just say google it. Not helpful at all. if you have tips, please do provide) on normal things (not cutting edge items) where should I search first so I can learn more with less time waste. Some resources are too deep and for beginners like me, it is not of any use. I am looking for more of a reasoning type of resources so I can at least know that it also the thing.

98,Building an elevator in a tree without killing myself?,1546277596,"I want to build a tiny room (maybe 2.5'x4' and 5' tall) containing a desk and chair.  The room will contain a car battery powered winch that will lift it 60' into the air, supported by a cable connected to a high tree branch.  I will then sit in my tiny office in the tree with a beautiful view while I work on my laptop.

When I am done working I return to the ground and plug in the battery charger to recharge the battery for the next day.

I don't want to die, but I would love to do my work from an office with a nice view.

The tree:  I've got a huge tree in the back yard.  I haven't identified a specific branch to use yet, but I think I will probably be able to fine a branch about a foot in diameter to use.  Even if the branch is only 6 inches in diameter it should be plenty strong enough.  The wind loads and ice loads on this tree have definitely been higher than my weight and the weight of this room.  And the tree won't be supporting the additional weight during wind or ice storms because I won't go up in the tree during wind or ice storms.

The winch:  I've got a battery powered winch rated to 2000 lb.  The cable is in pretty rough shape (I used it to drag some large rocks around) so I'll buy a new cable for the winch.  Assuming I weigh 200 lbs, and the room, winch, and battery weigh 100 lbs, how strong would you make the cable?

The room:  I'm thinking of using bolted together angle iron for the frame.  I'm not sure what I'd use for the walls, but I'll probably include some foam board for insulation so I can use the office for more of the year.  The windows will be plexiglass.  The north facing window will be large and fixed.  There will be smaller east and west windows that will open so it doesn't get too hot in the summer.  The south wall will be solid to block sun.  I'll sit facing north.  I might try to figure out a heating source to extend the seasons I can use this, but it is possible my body heat will be sufficient heating for most of the year.

Furniture:  The desk will just be built in single board.  The seat might be an office chair, or maybe an office chair with the base removed, built into place.

Stability:  I will want the room to face in a specific direction, not spin freely and preferably not swing too much.  So once I'm in position up in the tree I want to connect it in some way to the tree.  I think it should be easy to have a second rope tied around another branch that I can grab and pull tightish to provide some stability.

Safety:  This is the big one!  How do I do this without dying?  Everything should work.  The winch should be easily strong enough.  The cable should be easily strong enough.  The branch should be easily strong enough.  It should be easy to build the room strong enough.  But what additional features would you add to improve safety?

3,Fluid Mechanics Elevating Water Issue,1546262900,"Hello everyone. I am trying to elevate 200.000 m^(3) water per day from a dam, to a water treatment plant.

1. Plant is located at elevation of 260 meters from mean sea level.
2. Dams water surface elevated 100 meters from sea level.

What i am asked to calculate;

1. The energy required to elevate water from the reservoir to the treatment plant by ignoring the head loss due to friction and minor losses.
2. Make a research to select an appropriate pump(s)

What should be my approach?

I have determined the volume flow rate; Q = 125/54 m^(3)/s . And according to the volume flow rate equation;

Q = A v , I assumed to have 1 m/s of average velocity, and in that case i have determined required diameter of pipeline.

Then i assumed the atmoshperic pressures are the same at 100m and 260m.

&amp;#x200B;

According to my assumption; I used General Energy Equation;

I ignored pressures, water velocity at dam ( since it must be almost 0), I ignored hR and hL in the system since the question told me to. I only used hA in my equation. And i ended up with this;

&amp;#x200B;

100 + hA = 260 + v^(2)/2g === hA = 160.050 m

And later, i used Power delivered by the pump equation;   


PA= hA.y.Q

Where;  


* hA = Energy added to system
* y = Spesific weight of the fluid
* Q = Volume flow rate.

And i ended up with PA= 3634.5 kW which i called as energy required to elevate water.

&amp;#x200B;

I have considered the fact that one pipeline and one single pump will not be efficent. So what i am thinking is (if my calculations till now are correct) i will rewrite the equations, according to suitable pumps' volume flow rate (Q). And i will obtain multiple pipelines, i will sum them to obtain the total energy required.

&amp;#x200B;

My question; Is my procedure correct? If it is not, what should i be doing?

In the interview, it seemed as though I would be on the software side of things. Programming PLCs, HMI programming, SCADA... Etc. What ended up happening is that I got put into hardware design. I spec out PLCs, power supplies, power distribution, Ethernet networks. The problem is that I'm mechanical engineering by education. I don't have an intuition for electrical systems like I do for mechanical systems. There is very little personal growth in my role. I guess I can say that I'm building a familiarity with automation hardware. Beyond that, I don't feel like I'm getting much in the realm of skill building. I'm tasked with pumping out as many projects as I can as quickly as I can. I don't have opportunities for refining our design process.

\- Temperature coefficient of SPAN/ZERO: I have no idea what this is. All I could find was

""The maximum amount the span reading could change at any point within the compensated temperature range. This error is typically expressed as a percentage of full scale output of reading. It can also be expressed as percentage of full scale per °C, °F or K e.g. ±0.02%FS/°C. "" 

But it made me none the wiser. Can someone dumb it down for me, perhaps even show me a quick example calculation?

&amp;#x200B;

What would be the total uncertainty? I got 0.28% but that's only by adding  ‘combined error’, ‘zero unbalance’, ‘non-linearity’, ‘hysteresis’ and ‘repeatability' uncertainties.

&amp;#x200B;

For some time I have thought about the technical feasibillity of a, lets call it an escape elevator, I have come up with.  
Now I want to ask the engineers here what they think about such a device, if it would be safe enough to use and if it would work as i have imagined it.  


I thought about adding multiple vertical Rack-like rails, either inside a building down the middle of a staircase, where there is enough free space, or outside a building, alongside the windows of each floor.  
Now every floor would need to have small foldable seats for every person there (or small plattforms to sand on) in case of an emergency, these seats would be unfolded and snapped to the rail, the user would move on to them via a small foldable metal plattform, put on a seatbelt, and pull a saftey pin which would relase a ratchet like device which would interlock with the ""teeth"" of the rack (or rail). After the pin is pulled the seat should start to descend through the weight of the user, but not exceed more than the usual elevator speed limited by the ratchet mechanism. At the end of the rail the spacing of the teeth should slow down the seat and finaly disengage it at the ground level, so that the user could walk away and make space for the next arrival.  
Of course there are some problems, like what to do if a seat gets stuck (i thought about a way to replace the ""ratchet through the pull of another safety pin) or how to manage the large number of people using it.

I'm a senior MET student who's also working full time for a company in a drafting / associate engineer role (I don't have an official title because I'm working for them thru a temp agency). It's a fairly small company and I'm on a team with two other engineers.

During one of our weekly engineering meetings, I suggested I could code a program that would write part numbers for us since the part numbers we use are based off the dimensions of the part being named. We were using a table printed out that had all the info on it and it was cumbersome and time consuming to use the table. I had just finished a programming course for school and had done fairly decent (a B+). Here's the thing, the class was all about programming in C, and I don't know any other languages. 

For my project at work this is fine, because programming in C will give me a program that will be perfectly useful for what I want to do with it and I've already completed a code for one of the part number schemes we use and it works quite nicely. The interface is a bit rough and my co-workers will have to use the same complier I used to write the code to execute the program, but it works. Just looks a bit rough.

However, I'd like to know if there are any other languages I should learn that may be more useful to me as a mechanical. I've heard Python is used a lot, but I know the students in the regular engineering department learn MatLab.

45,Is sharing past exams with future students academic misconduct?,1546099183," 

Hi all,

I'm currently an engineering student who took a course where the professor after grading exams hands back the exams with the answer keys for all the students to keep. So each student who takes that class and that exam ends up keeping the physical copy of their exam with them even after the class is over. For this course, we only had 1 midterm and got to keep that midterm paper. This professor does not post his own past exams on her website and does not provide any practice aside from a sample exam with 10 or so questions. Also keep in mind this class isn't curved. A 1-2% bump for cutoffs at most.

I received my copy of my midterm and lent it to a friend who would take the class the following semester. I didn't give him the answer key. I just wanted him to have some sort of study guide when he took the class next semester. This was a multiple choice exam. Turns out he took photos of the actual physical exam and sent it to someone else taking the course in the following semester. My friend did say that the midterm that he took had very different questions than the ones on the exam I lent him, which tells me that the professor envisioned exams being shared and changed the questions on them.

My name wasn't anywhere on his photos, but I feel incredibly anxious and nervous about possibly being caught by the university. I don't like the idea of a chain of photos of the exam floating around in people's hands. So this brings up a question. Is sharing past exams with future students academic misconduct if the professor let the students keep the exams? I wasn't trying to break any rules or affect the entire class. I feel like lots of students do this at my university without even thinking about it, but I'm afraid that this is misconduct and that I'll get caught.

I am currently working as a universal banker/customer service at a retail bank in Bangladesh. 

I always wanted to be a prolific inventor making great inventions. So I joined a BS in EEE but then had to switch to BS Econ because I failed at the math. I joined MS in Econ but then shifted to MBA because I failed at the math. I have OCD, and it was more severe back then and I sometimes lost track of the math in the middle and then I could not understand it fully. In Economics the math are usually 4-5 pages and if you lose out one line you cannot understand the rest. No one would sit you down and explain it and reading books don't help. 

Anyways, I am sick and tired of my current job as a universal banker/customer service. It is grunt clerical and conventional work, no creativity or anything, just type and seal and sign straight procedures. I also really dislike people being in my face at customer service (social anxiety) and the way people here treat service workers like me. 

I am out of home for 14 hours but in the time I get free, I doodle so called ""engineering inventions"". I know these simple gadgets would not have enough demand to justify patenting them and no one would fund their prototyping or development but I can't deny my passions there. So yeah, my plan was to become an engineer, get some experience as an engineer and then maybe start my own engineering or inventing business on the side and if it gets up switch to it full time. 

So my questions are: 

* Q1) What are my chances of getting into a Masters by Research program (or similar) in Mechanical Engineering? Target countries are USA, Canada or Australia. How difficult would be the journey? Please be realistic. 

* Q2) What do I need to do to get into the above program? ",AskEngineers,False,Experimentalphone,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aakb7f/realistically_what_are_my_chances_of_getting_into/

67,How do I get into a career as an FEA analyst?,1546025856,"I’m looking to make a career change and am targeting  what I think would be a design engineer with focus on being an FEA analyst. I also see a fair amount of posts warning that “real” FEA should only be done by a trained professional. So how do I become a FEA trained professional? As I said I’m looking to make a career change but maybe the info would apply to new grads as well. 

Steps I’m taking or have taken: 
-BS in Mech Eng
-ASME Intro and Adv FEA course
-ASME Fracture Mechanics course
-Going back to university to get masters in Mech Eng specializing in Solid Mechanics, Design, and Manufacturing
-Took a position that deals a fair amount with ASME BPVC Sec. VIII Div-2/3 (for my current infirmary anyway)
-Sec. VIII Div-2 Design-by-Analysis course
-Hobbyist in CNC and 3D printing

Questions: 
-Any feedback on what I’ve already done?
-Recommendations on what to do going forward? 
-How much effort/cost should I spend getting to know a specific CAD or FEA package (Solidworks/Catia or Abaqus/Ansys)?
-My masters currently looks to focus on static stress analysis. How valuable is adding classes that deal with dynamic loading, heat transfer, electromagnetism, or fluids/CFD?
-Do analysts tend to focus on only one of those aspects of FEA or multiple aspects?
-Do career paths tend to start as “design engineers” focusing on CAD then move into FEA or do they start in FEA? 
-More generally how do I look for positions that are or will lead to being an FEA analyst? Name of the position? Focus on certain industries? Certain companies?
-How valuable is a PE license? 
-Would you recommend a bigger or smaller company to balance focusing on FEA but not just cranking out the same generic boring analysis to get a code stamp?
-My masters will be online so no thesis, just an extra few courses. How much of a knock will that be in the job hunt?

My background is I have 10+ years experience as a petroleum engineer, specifically a completions engineer (kinda like a drilling engineer) for an operator. I have some experience that I think would directly transfer to an FEA analyst type position (beyond general work experience) but not a ton. 

I’m kind of looking to make a career change anyway but have absolutely fallen in love with the taste of FEA I’ve gotten in a recent position so I’m looking for any advice to dive into that field. Thanks!!

76,Switching paths early in career?,1546011516,"Looking for some outside perspective of engineers with more experience and time under their belts or who may have come to a similar crossroads that I'm at right now. Any input is appreciated.

I graduated with a chemical engineering degree, moved away from home and have been working as a process engineer for nearly 2 years at a solid company. The environment is relatively high-pressure and fast-paced, but the people are nice and I'm getting good experience. Overall I would take less pay for less of this type of environment. Living away from family has also made me want to move back home closer to them before they're too old to enjoy being around, so a big focus of my next step is getting back near to family.

Before graduating I also got co-op experience with process engineering at a small, slower-paced place. I found the more intimate nature of the relationships to be a double-edged sword depending on the person or the day but preferable to the high-stakes, large corporate environment I'm in now. I got experience here working with AutoCAD and doing some VBA programming that I enjoyed. 

I've come to the conclusion that process engineering gives me the creeps.

78,Small OEM - our model #'s are slowly becoming abbreviated BOMs. Need advice on sales/model/BOM structure,1546008009,"**TLDR:** The company I work for makes (from design to finished product) and sells construction equipment under our unique model numbers. However the machines vary so much due to all the different accessories and options, that to distinguish one machine from the next, our model numbers/names are slowly building into an abbreviated BOM that is way too long and seems like the wrong way to go about this.

**More explanations:**  
I work for a small manufacturing company for the construction industry that does well in our niche market. One of the reasons we have grown over the 50+ years is our willingness to customize and grow our lineup of standard machines to basically anything the customer asks for. We do almost everything in house which allows us the flexibility of customization as well as shorten up our lead times. However this leads to a lot of cut corners organizationally to simply build and get it out the door to the customer and worry about the inventory/BOM later. We offer accessories such as: water pumps, pressure washers, air compressors, generators, extra hydraulic circuits, specific electrical requirements like voltage and frequency etc, which all have an effect on the final BOM.   
   
**For example, here is a grouping of hydraulic power units we might sell:**  
-*XXX/30HP/YYY/460/60* - (XXX frame model, 30HP electric motor, spec'd to power our YYY model, shipping to location with 460V - 60Hz supply, 60Hz also determines which hydraulic pump we need to select)  
-*XXX/30HP/YYY/415/50* - (XXX frame model, 30HP electric motor, spec'd to power our YYY model, shipping to location with 415V - 50Hz supply, different hydraulic pump and electrical control box than previous model #)  
-*XXL/40HP/YYY/415/50/15AC/PW* - (XXL frame model, 40HP electric motor, spec'd to power our YYY model, shipping to location with 415V - 50Hz supply, with onboard hydraulically driven 15cfm air compressor and power washer. Larger motor and hydraulic pump needed to power extra accessories, larger XXL frame needed to package everything)  
-*XXX/40HP/YYY/ZZZ/460/60* - (XXX frame model, 30HP electric motor, spec'd to power our YYY OR ZZZ models, shipping to location with 460V - 60Hz supply, extensive hydraulic circuit changes/settings to allow individual operation of either YYY or ZZZ machine)  
  
About 20% of our order requests can't be matched with a model number/BOM that exists yet, so the sales guys sell it as *XXX/30HP/YYY/460/60-SP*. ""-SP"" means its a special machine and therefore engineering &amp; purchasing need to baby this one until it's out the door. Whether the actual BOM gets updated in our system or a model number is actually created is unlikely.  
  
At my previous job in the trucking industry, trucks were ordered ""buffet-style"" by features. The engineers controlled what features could be selected with each other and then a system of coding rules added or subtracted parts to the final BOM based on what the complete list of features selected by the customer looked like. It seems like we need something similar to this but I have no idea on how to implement/where to find something like this.

84,What pressure rating should a super-scale whipped cream dispenser be?,1545983917,"So, I was drinking the other night and came up with this idea of taking one of those whipped cream dispensers that use a nitrous oxide charge and scaling it up to industrial size.

The one I have has a volume of 1 pint. You typically fill it with 1 cup of whip cream ingredients (so halfway). Then you inject an 8 gram nitrous oxide charge and the whole thing is now pressurized. Shake it up a bit and now you have instant whipped cream.

Great. Now I want to make one myself with a five gallon capacity (so 10 gallon volume if linear scaling is what's best, I really don't know). If it helps, the information I was able to find is that the NO^(2) chargers are pressurized to 50 bar.

So the questions:

* How do I convert 8 grams of nitrous oxide in a one-pint volume which is half-filled with liquid into the pressure rating in PSI for a vessel that can hold 5 gallons of liquid?
* How does 8 grams of nitrous oxide scale, like how much will I need per batch?
* Is 50/50 liquid/air appropriate when scaling this or should this ratio scale differently than the volume (like how volume and surface area don't scale together, for example)? This is more about the pressure involved than mixing of the NO^(2). All of the NO2 is released (and possibly recaptured?) after the batch is done.
* I'm not committed to NO^(2) but CO^(2) and O^(2) are out because they have bad interactions with the ingredients. That said, I want to keep it cheap. Any suggestions with this regard?

I'm assuming this the be done at no higher temperature than 80 f. Also, I'm assuming minimal dissolving of NO^(2) into the liquid.

Also, this is not actually for whipped cream, but for doing rapid pressure infusion of various flavor into alcohol. I'm currently using a whipped cream dispenser (which works very well) but I want to look into large scale since making this one cup at a time sucks ass.",AskEngineers,False,OneAndOnlyJackSchitt,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aa8cx7/what_pressure_rating_should_a_superscale_whipped/
85,Actuonix linear actuator's control signal,1545981944,"I was wondering If anybody has ever used a Actuonix linear actuator, specifically the L16-R model (RC controlled linear servo). The datasheet states that the position of the linear actuator be controlled by a 1.0-2.0mSec positive duty cycle control signal (2.0mSec pulse to fully extend, 1.0mSec to fully retract) similar to a rotational servo, but does not state how long the period of this signal should be. I was able to get some movement out of the servo by varying the positive duty cycle of a 20mSec signal from 5%-10% at 0.1% increments but there still seems to be some inconsistencies in my software. I was curious as to if anybody has had any luck with fully controlling this device and if so, how?

87,Going into engineering with depression?,1545975988,"Hi

I am currently in high school (not my senior year, I have a bit of time) and I've been wanting to go into engineering my entire life, specifically the aerospace field. I am aware of the rigor and challenge of going to school for engineering, and I know I could do it normally. However, I tend to go through ridiculous and long periods of extreme depression when I can't function properly at all, nor concentrate and it's happened for years now. Not moderate or mild, I mean severe. I don't really like doing anything other than building or creating stuff and I love space and physics (why I chose aerospace), but even this is the last option since I don't really want to do anything for a living at all. The times when I am able to feel passion for things I genuinely enjoy, engineering is one of them but I'm not sure that I would be able to successfully complete school or even joining the actual work force because of my deteriorated mental health. I don't mean to come across as ""attention seeking"" and I want no sugar coating or sympathy, just the truth and legitimate advice on whether or not I should change my career path or lean towards something else.

&amp;#x200B;

So to summarize, my question is this: 

Would I *honestly* be able to survive going through with it? 

If not, is there any other option for me or am I just screwed?

89,Expert needed - Stainless steel passivation/ maintenance,1545967803,"Hi all. I'm a process engineer and am in a pickle. 
    
We use stainless steel repeatedly in a reducing furnace (Max temp 800C) and over time the stainless steel builds up with solder material. Now we oxidize daily in an oven (with air) but we're still seeing buildup. I know standard passivation is a quick soak in an acid bath, but I can't find any resources to help with a true maintenance procedure.
    
My guess is the solder material is attaching to free iron under the chromium oxide, exposed in the reducing furnace due to scratching or reduction in itself. So I need to figure out ways to prevent that. 
    
Any advice/discussion is appreciated. ",AskEngineers,False,WhoseHatIsThat,/r/AskEngineers/comments/aa6h2j/expert_needed_stainless_steel_passivation/

I don't have a clear path to 6 figures in front of me really and especially not one in the next 3 years. I've also noticed an uptick in network engineer and systems engineer entry level salaries and a downtick in mechanical which has pretty much swapped the two where these IT engineer positions start at 5-7k more than the mechanical positions.
