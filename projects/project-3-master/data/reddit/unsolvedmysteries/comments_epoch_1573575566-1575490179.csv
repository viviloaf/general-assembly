2,Accept this offer or wait to see if I’m granted a fellowship for grad school?,1575489546,"The offer is $68,000 with some construction/consulting company. It’d be a 3 year rotation program, first year I’d be on a consulting schedule with them. 

But I applied to grad school for mech engineering and also to a fellowship. I know I’ll get into the grad school (same as my undergrad and I’ve talked to faculty, etc about it). I applied to some outside fellowship, and there’s a chance I may get it but I won’t know all this until after February. 

I have to make a decision on this job offer by next Monday. 

What should I do? I’m so confused. If I get the fellowship, I’ll definitely just do grad school. Everything will be paid, I love learning &amp; research. If not, I can’t afford grad school and thus won’t do it. As for the job, I like the travel schedule for consulting, the only downside is that I have to leave my 1 year old dog behind with my mom. 

I’ve already declined a past offer a month ago because it was too soon for me to decide (and that offer was muuuuch better pay but the job was less exciting for me).

6,Excessive static shock from 3D printer,1575485376,"I recently set my 3D printer (Ender 5, if it matters) in an enclosed shelf. Ever since then, both the printer and the shelf have been giving me consistent static shocks.

When I don't run the machine (power strip that it and some accessories are connected to is switched off) I do not seem to receive these shocks.

The shelf is entirely metal except for some sort of fake wood door. It sits on plastic or rubber casters, which sit on vinyl tiles on a concrete floor. The house has no grounds (very old house, not mine), so I'd guess that the shelf is very isolated and has no way to dissipate the charge.

Is this a sign of an electrical issue, either of the printer or the house? Other appliances don't seem to have this issue. Would simply removing the shelf from the casters give the charge a pathway to dissipate? What would be causing this build-up of charge?

Gas turbines are simple and give good efficiency at full high RPM. So wouldn't generating electricity to charge a small battery pack which actually drives the wheels be more efficient?

Moreover this could be adapted to current electric cars. A Gas turbine generator in the car will be small and be able to charge the batteries efficiently.

I know this idea failed in the past, but that was due to GM etc., trying to use Gas turbine for propulsion as efficiency is terrible at low speed.

In an hybrid-electric the engine would start when batteries are below a threshold and charge them at full power.

12,"Growth, earnings potential, and path for Building Automation System (BAS) and controls engineers - Tell me about your field",1575479489,"I'm a BSME with a couple years of background in HVAC design and facilities engineering. I have a couple other years experience working in various other, unrelated engineering roles (project management, tool design). I have the opportunity to switch companies and start a role as a project engineer working on building automation control systems (BAS), from design and programming to commissioning. The role has field work involved, which I enjoy. 

The two things that I am potentially attracted to in this role are:

1. I can feel good about what I'm creating. These are projects that are attempting to save money by reducing energy costs/waste. Outside of engineering, I spend quite a bit of time outdoors and thus doing something that reduces our impact on the environment is important to me (the magnitude of this is debatable, I know). This is different from my previous jobs where I was creating things that I did not value.
2. Higher salary ceiling. From my research, controls and BAS engineers earn more than the roles I've been in (HVAC design, tool design).

So, I have some questions for you controls and building automation engineers.

1. One of my goals is to maximize my income. Which path within this BAS field should I be aiming for if that is my goal? I am particularly interested in hearing about niches within this industry that are in demand (I have an entrepreneurial mindset rather than a 'climb the corporate ladder mindset').
2. How do you see the BAS field growing/developing in the next 20 years?
3. What are the skills, tools, and programming languages that I should be shooting for in order to be effective in this field?
4. What are the certifications within the BAS industry that will make me the most marketable to future employers?
5. This is a long shot. One of my 'dreams' is to work at remote infrastructure sites (I like being in the middle of nowhere, on the road). I would love, for example, to work for one of the government programs (as a contractor) in Antarctica, supporting/building/commissioning their infrastructure in harsh environments. Does anyone have insight into this and if pursuing a career path in BAS is conducive to that kind of work?

23,Recovering metals from slag,1575451164,"I'm currently working on a little side project where I try to to figure out a way how to recover metal residiues from slag. Basically, when you're smelting ore, you produce a layer of slag on top which consists of all kinds of materials found in the ore. Typically, it's made up of silicates and traces of other components. However, there is still some of your valuable metals in there. I want to know how to recover that.

I found a company that does that kind of work, and in one of their advertisement flyers they basically explain the setup as following:

1) Grind the slag to a fine granulate 2) Wash and screen your granulate 3) Congratulations, you now have recovered your metals

What I don't understand is how you actually separate the slag from the metal pieces. Do they separate by grinding and screening? How does that work? Is it related to different hardness of slag and metal, so that the metals remain as bigger chunks? Or can you just ""wash"" off the slag from your metal?

1. you don't die on contact (I understand it is nearly impossible to make this safe and I have no intent to harm others)
2. they  arc for a distance of 15.6 cm consistently. (meaning I don't have to  ""jumpstart"" the current by touching the rods with a screw. They need to  have a length of 15.6cm so I can get the long electric arc effect.  Unless this works and looks good at a shorter distance)
3. they  continuously arc (currently I have two rods that create the arc, one  time only, using a large microwave MOT that I plugged in.  After I touch  the rods together they make one large ""burst"" of energy before  stopping.)

This is my first post on this subreddit and was just wondering if you guys could give me some opinions with regards to which job offer I should take on. I am currently fresh out of uni and have just completed all of my coursework with a GPA that is slightly above average and I was just a bit torn between the two jobs as they both have their own perks. Note that both jobs are right up my alley.

Basically, Job A is working for a local council (the council opened up this job specifically for me) in the wastewater sector and what I will be doing is primarily creating manuals, work instructions, maintenance plans, taking readings and assessing pump stations (so a lot of fieldwork stuff - I believe at least). I will need to move 3 hours away from home (which isn't too bad), but the place is quite rural (not that I care too much about outside activities anyway because I'm an introvert haha!). The duration of the work is 3 months and I might have a chance of joining their graduate program at the end of it. It pays fairly well and I should be able to live comfortably.

Job B, on the other hand, is working for a small consultancy company (&lt;10 people) in the city , where I would create P&amp;ID, PFD, AutoCAD drawings, and HAZOP for a water treatment project. Note that although this project would build my skills as a graduate, I would have to take a pay cut of 60-75% and also work overtime for most of my time over there. This work will mostly be office type work so it will be rare for me to do fieldwork.  I will also get a graduate offer if I do well during my 3 month period, at which the pay rate would probably increase back to the normal market rate and I would be able to do a bit more fieldwork (not sure what pay they're offering yet since I'm not on that level yet).

Overall I just feel that it's between having an easier time and much better pay vs. taking a pay cut and lifestyle for more ""experience"".

As someone that is aspiring to manage my investments (think something like a part-time Warren Buffet type of thing) while working as an engineer full-time, what do you guys think would provide the most benefit from your experiences?

After speaking numerous times extensively with someone in the software consulting field regarding their career, I am very interested in pursuing that field.

I was also given recommendations on what I should study and learn about should I decide to pursue this career (SQL, Python, Oracle, SAP, Manhattan, etc) and was even recommended to read the book, The Goal, which I have started reading as well.

As the internet really does have a plethora of knowledge and all of this could be learned and understood online, is it worth it to go back to university to pursue a degree in industrial engineering?

A lot of my friends have told me it would be a waste of money to return to school, as everything I would need to learn really could be learned online, but these friends in question are mostly pursuing degrees in different fields of engineering or graduated in a field of engineering.

Usually when I want to leave early there's nothing going on ( they might be grinding or polishing something, waiting till night shift to do some big task, ext.).

There aren’t any opportunities in the city for nuclear engineering specifically, but I’ve been wanting to change my career discipline to more of a mechanical engineering role.

I’m 19 and work as an intern for an engineering company which working in Building Services engineering, such a managing installation of plant into buildings, providing knowledge to clients about what products they should use, choosing products, checking drawings and so on where I’m 1/5 years through the program. 

Next year they want to send us, the students to university, however, this is where the problem starts for me.

In the email they sent us, they said that you don’t have to go to university, but you should if you want to become a chartered mechanical engineer (in my case) in building services engineering, but, they also said that if you want to go into project management, then you don’t have to, but still can.

I want to go to university as I’m more interested in the technical side and would want to become chartered. However, I know I’m going to die doing the level of maths they do there, as well as I know that I’m going to struggle doing part-time university while working full-time, which I don’t see myself doing. For me in this regard, it’s either 0% or 100% and not a balancing act. 

Furthermore, after talking to a few people about building services engineering, they said that its quite a niche specialist job which would limit me in my engineering paths after university, in terms of only being able to do mechanical engineering in building services and not some other company type – unless I’m seeing it in the wrong light. 

So far, I’ve considered the following options; 

Not going university and just rolling with it until I finish my 5th year and become an assistant engineer.

Or leave the company and go full time university on my own, but spend a year to prepare my lacking maths. Then I wouldn’t get paid, instead, I’d live off the government, but something for something. 

Or take a gap year and just see if I want to do something completely else.

57,There are many ideas for digital cameras I'd like to combine. How should I go about connecting with people to make it happen?,1575397117,"I do technical research on my own time to look for problems and inspiration for solutions. I found many ideas for improvement. They combine stuff from real products and research papers in journals.

1) Panasonic organic CMOS sensor. It uses photoconductive film and adjusts analog gain by voltage adjustments. It separates the photo electric effect from charge storage. Panasonic says it's to improve dynamic range and reduce noise.

2) I learned reducing downstream electrical noise is more important than how many photons get collected. I've found high speed cameras with a high base ISO. The problem is if it's too high, it creates complications like ND filters. A solution is to use many short exposures with frame averaging. This is to produce the equivalent of one longer exposure. An example is if the exposure time is 1/8000 but you need 1/50, the required frame count for averaging is 160.

3) To make frame averaging for motion picture possible, a global shutter and special RAM unit will hold the frames. When the effective exposure (like 1/50) is achieved, the processor averages the frames (160 frames at 1/8000) then saves it as one file to storage all in real time. The averaging happens **before** the demosaicing to minimize computing requirements.

4) Instead of linear ADC, the gain will follow a gamma compression curve. This is to enable higher dynamic range without punishing over exposure. It will also benefit lower dynamic range scenes.

5) In post capture, the gamma compressed color values will have an expansion curve applied. It will expand from 10 or 12 bits per channel, to a 32 bit linear curve. The computer will do this **without** saving it as 32 bits per channel. ICC profiles and LUTs will only be for preview until export. The user can get a preview regarding what colors are in and out of range of the profiles.

6) There'll be ""express draft mode."" It's for still and motion picture editing. It'll convert to lossy compressed and lower resolution for preview and quick edits. It'll not apply for export or when the user needs the full resolution (like sharpening).

7) Lossy or lossless compression will use YUV system for storage. Lossless will be designed to ensure verbatim conversions back and forth.

8) Source code will be given away for the post capture image processing pipeline. This is for other image editing apps to have less guess work. A third party can write modifications as desired.

9) Reduction of gain for specific regions. For example, if there's a candle light scene, the ISO will be 6400 except for the flames in which the ISO is 800.

10) Dark black regions often confuse auto exposure systems. My solution is subgroup based exposure metering. Instead of metering for all metering points individually, the meter assigns regions of similarity to subgroups (it's stratified sampling), does an average of each subgroup, then selectively meters off the subgroups. If a subgroup is too dark, it's ignored. If it's too bright, the ISO for that subgroup is reduced.

11) Dual Pixel phase detect autofocus. It's not limited to Canon.

12) If used on phones, an array of small sensors and lenses automatically blends the images together (like the Light L16). The focal length is adjustable by using the periscope principle to keep the device thin and eliminate protruding parts. The aperture will be continuously adjustable for depth of field control. For stills (not motion picture), the aperture can be adjusted and/or use a post capture bokeh (aperture adjustment only for motion picture). An ASIC or external FPGA device will be used.

13) For single sensor interchangeable lens cameras, the digital back can be installed in different units like SLRs (Canon and Nikon), mirrorless, view cameras, and drones. The MILCs will have mounts to install native mount, Nikon F, or Canon EF all without using separate camera bodies.

What're favorite ideas from the list? I'm thinking about starting a company and connecting with researchers to make it happen? How should I go about approaching people from different universities to get researchers involved? What universities should I reach out to? What resources do you recommend for advice? How do I ensure mutual follow up (I often struggle with that)? When the ideas are combined, how should I reach out to investors? What advice do you have?

All three of them were confused with the terminology Cost of Quality. Then I went on to ask about what are their KPIs ( Key performance indices) and how they measure them. Again blank stare. Finally I asked how closely does the QA team work with their inspectors, how are they controlling key features in a part ( control plan), how are they calculating and mitigating risks (PFMEA), but it seems that they have never heard of what a PFMEA or control plan is. I checked to see if these are aerospace only terminology but it is not.

The worst part was how does Quality contribute to continuous improvement? One of the quality engineers started saying something, then the other guy cut him off saying that they have a department that handles that sort of thing so it's not their 'issue'.

I have a background in engineering and I am finishing up an Engineering Management degree. I believe the most important factor in a happy career is identifying your personality and finding a role that suits and applying it to a field of interest (i.e. personality is more important for day by day happiness than subject matter interest).  I gave myself a quick and honest assessment of what I am and what I am not and this is what I found. Granted, what I found indicates I would not be a good technical individual contributor/engineer (which I am now). Please keep in mind that I can do/tolerate everything under the  *What I am Not* section, I just either don't like doing it or am not naturally inclined towards it.  I'm hoping for any general suggestions or guidance regarding the kinds of roles as my interests are wide/varied. Thanks!

74,Am I being trained enough?,1575374056,"I'm a relatively new engineer in the UK and I've been at this place for a few months now, my first full time position after graduating. Its in a field I really enjoy, quite a booming industry where I live as well.

Its slowly been revealed to me that my department has mostly left over the last year, and that its people from other departments, left over interns and some contract workers.
Within my first month my supervisor left, one of the remaining senior people. I feel like I've only gotten some basic concept level training within those 2 or so weeks, but not really any good internal processes training (as most people who knew/made them are gone), basically no software training (its extremely software heavy) and a bit vague and uncertain on the information I get on general theory.

I started off extremely enthusiastic and enjoyed working a lot, but I've become somewhat discouraged by how quickly I've been left to myself, with no real point of contact for help or information. I've been put on some projects alone and I haven't been shown how to do anything, just some general information on how its done, and usually no in depth help into how its done in software.

I am able to try to get some help from my coworkers but it often its just a circle of ""maybe ask X"", and really only the department head can help who is extremely busy, and sometimes can't show me exactly what to do. Its not that they won't help, its more so that they can't...

One of my friends said I could just take it slow and cruise, but I'm actually really wanting to learn and progress, that's the thing that disheartens me the most. I'm also getting burnt out from putting in so much time and effort going through internal documents and past projects etc to teach myself, knowing someone could spend a small portion of our morning setting me up and guiding me into a task or project.

As its such a booming industry, there is definitely many job offers around in the same role with likely higher pay, but I've only been in this company a couple of months, I don't know if I'm getting ahead of myself.

Anyway, I'd like to get your take on these potential 'red flags' that I noticed during the interview process. Granted, this position requires a clearance which I have, which could explain the eagerness to hire, **but my gut tells me to run.**

The Bad signs:

1. They made an offer after a 30 min phone call with minimal technical questions.
2. The team I would be joining is composed of about 10 very early and early career engineers and about 5 super gray beards (30 years+).  So all the the mid career engineers quit for better jobs, right?
3. The offer just barely by the skin of teeth compensates for the horrendous cost of living in the bay area (about 20% more).  I could probably squeeze a bit more, maybe a 30% increase if I went for the throat.  I currently live LA, which is still high COL, but not bay area high (full retard stupid expensive).
4. The program is mostly converting older aerospace SW code into more modern languages like Matlab, python, C++

Maybe Good Things:

1. I could probably get a TS clearance. (job security and potential consulting opportunities later).
2. The aerospace product this job is for is pretty neat conceptually at least.
3. I could maybe become a consultant that knows older languages like Fortran and make big bucks barely maintaining legacy systems.

4. What advice do you give to someone interested in the field? In particular, what do you suggest to start getting a better practical hold of control/automation, for a student who has only seen the theoretical side?
5. Do you regret choosing this path? Do you enjoy going to work?

If any of you are working in Australia, what is the industry like here? Do you feel you are payed enough for the work you do?

87,Sand Injection into high pressure line,1575347060,"I work in oil &amp; gas on the fracking side in Texas. In our daily operations, sand is mixed with water in a blender like machine then passed through a reciprocating pump. The pumps pressurize sand/chem/water mixture to 6-12 ksi depending on the location. The high pressure slurry then travels downhole to the rock formation to prop open the rock fractures which can be 4-10 thousand feet below surface.

The sand wreaks havoc on pumps in just a few days or weeks. They must be constantly replaced. Is there a way that you could inject the sand after the pumps pressurize the slurry?

Hydraulics and pneumatics are complex (for accurate control) and bit expensive. So I have been thinking of a setup of crank slider mechanism.

** Setup of what I am thinking** 

The whole setup (motor and crank slider) is mounted on a adjustable base whose height can be adjusted. The crank displaces the work piece by certain displacement to generate stress. The load cell is attached to the slider which measures the force. The adjustment of adjustable base height is automatically controlled based on reading of load cell. 


I feel crank slider would be far easier to fabricate (IDK I might be wrong also. Correct me if so) and cheaper also for this setup. It seems like a reasonable option considering I am mainly focused on stress ratio of 0.

The major questions are:

* I am worried about impact of crank slider and swingarm which provides different result than seen in real life.

* I think testing just stress ratio of 0 is okay and I don't need to test -ve stress ratios. Correct me here also if I am wrong.

6,What is a reasonable design assumption for humidity inside an industrial electrical building?,1575305286," 

Hi everyone, hoping to tap into some industry knowledge. 

Background: I help design prefabricated buildings for power distribution at industrial sites. A lot of the equipment is medium voltage VFDs and puts off a lot of heat (sensible load). HVAC systems we use can often get to something like (QTY6) 40RT units.

My question is, what is a reasonable assumption for what the humidity inside one of these buildings can get down to? One of my suppliers is sizing their units based on an assumption of 30-35% RH at steady state on a 105F day on the US gulf coast. My concern is that on a summer day in this area, the humidity can get up to 98%. Is it really reasonable to assume that these HVACs can get the indoor RH down to 30%? If not, what would be a more reasonable assumption?

Some notes: These are heavy-duty, industrial HVAC systems that are designed for high sensible loads. These buildings are unmanned so the doors aren't opening frequently. No windows. May or may not be positive pressure so there's some infiltration.

Also note that technically they're using indoor DB/WB temperatures of 80F/62F but my psychometric chart tells me that's about 36% RH. If I'm doing this wrong, call me out!

r/HVAC wasn't able to help me. They did point out that if you add more cooling, you can get down to a lower humidity, but I'm really only interested in an optimized system that only just meets the cooling requirements.

11,Want to move out of consulting (Civil/Env).,1575291451,"Hey everyone,

Currently over 8 years into a consulting job (4 years with a P.Eng.). We've had some recent events at work which have made me realize my future isn't in consulting (I can expand on this if there's interest, but will keep it brief for this post) and I'm wondering what some potential options are, or what others have considered/done. 

The obvious candidates are to move to a municipal position but in this &lt;500k population city they are sometimes few and far between and tend to go to people with much more experience. Regulatory agencies are pretty similar. Being on the client side seems pretty interesting, but the positions available usually are more senior than what I think I could apply for @ 8 years experience (""Director of Capital Works"", for example). I'm not really in a position to move cities at this point either.

Any other ideas? Out of the box ideas are certainly welcome.

I'm currently a grade 12 student in Canada and have been passionate about the aerospace industry and engineering route for roughly 2 years. At the moment, I'm looking to go to a university that's ranked roughly 250-300th globally, and 7th in Canada for its engineering program. They have the nieche aerospace program I'm looking for. I've already been accepted to a general engineering program (can pursue ME after general year) at a university that's roughly 100 rankings higher than the one I'm looking at. I'm also applying to a few others that are top 30 global where I would also pursue ME or materials should I be accepted. Something I noticed recently is that the aerospace program is majorly comprised of ME courses except for 4th year, and that made me wonder if I could pursue a double major in both ME and aerospace at that first university. 

I guess my main questions are: 

1. I am extremely passionate about aerospace and curious about fluids, should I pursue this degree alone or go for a double major (ME &amp; aero) seeing as the aerospace program is mainly comprised of ME courses?

2. Should I go to a higher ranking university? This aero program is niche and at a admittedly good, but still lower ranked university than one that I'm already into. 

3. What's my outlook with an aerospace eng degree if I stay in Canada mostly? I know the industry is in the States but there still is some stuff here. The program is also a CO-OP program. I'm also thinking about doing a graduate degree at an American school as I get a feeling that would open up a lot of doors. Also think I'd be willing to stretch into a few other industries.

4. I saw another post where someone said typically MEs do the manufacturing roles, I'd like to do some manufacturing at some point and am wondering if that's possible with an aerospace degree as well?

Let's say I want to build an underground room, fill it with stuff, and seal it in such a way that it will last 100,000 years. 

This room might contain books, CDs, papers, glass bottles, clothes, electronics, cash, TVs, canned food, gold, weapons, etc. 

Would extremely thick concrete walls with a solid reinforced rebar ceiling be most effective? Tree roots grow through concrete, and water deteriorates metal. We could put the bunker so far down that trees and water can't reach it. If the bunker were 1000 feet down, for example. If we made the walls 7 feet wide, alternating between concrete, metal, composite materials like nylon or hard plastic, with silica gel between each layer(to suck up residual oxygen), we could make an airtight container where nothing can seep in. The roof can be 10 feet of rebar and concrete and a huge metal slab that prevents it from collapsing in on itself after thousands of years. 

If this were successful, what would happen to the items in the room? What would happen to the papers, and most fragile items?

Key Notes:
1) 80ft water column (8"" diameter)
2) 20ft empty space above water (8"" diameter - (-45"" WC))
3) 1/2"" Tubing (95ft long - 5ft from bottom of column -          •75ft of water above the bottom of tube)

From my reading tonight it's basically impossible to siphon to a height more than ~30ft.
In the situation above though, with the additional pressure from the water column would I be able to siphon water out of the top of the tube?
If so, how low would I be able to bring the level of the water column to before I would lose my siphon.
If not, would a change in Tubing size, or another small change allow for this to happen...or is it just impossible without the use of a pump for continuous water movement.

Some of these columns have pumps in the bottom of them for water removal, but I am trying to think of additional ways of water removal that don't require as much infrastructure...and I figured the most basic way to start would be a siphon.

24,My University EE program is very power systems/electric machines focused and is quite rigid. Will it hurt the variety of jobs I will be able to apply for?,1575266351,"Hi! I'm a 2nd year EE student from LatAm. In my university, engineering academic programs tend to be long (up to 6years for an undergrad degree!) and rather specialized. Actually, this is common in South America, so this question might help others too. 

In my case, EE coursework is strongly focused on power systems, energy and electric machines and we have very few electives. We cover basics of electronics, control/automation and almost nothing of computer/programming stuff. In fact, Electronic engineering and Telecom eng. Are separate majors on their own so they delve way deeper into those subjects. Don't get me wrong, I love power and machines and the ""analog"" side, but I also find the digital side of EE very interesting. I don't know yet which branch I want to get into.

I understand this is not the case in many countries, where EE programs cover basics in almost all areas of the discipline, from power to computer architecture to electronics. This way, students get to -taste- a little bit of everything so they can specialize later with on-the-job experience or grad school.

So the question is, do you think I will be on a disadvantaged position if I try to get into an internship ""better"" suited for my fellow electronic and telecommunication students? Did you have a similar experience in your field changing from one subfield to another?

69,Am I setting myself up for failure by accepting this position? ( RF designer),1575163999,"&amp;#x200B;

I was hired by this company with the hopes to replace their existing RF engineer. Hes been in the field for over 40 years. Hes roughly in this 70s so I assume I may work with him for maybe a year or 2 if im lucky.

The field of work in pretty small. 2 way radios on UHF or VHF.

 

Here are my issues.  

1)

Not much teaching

While I don't for a moment think he has no interest in training me and teaching me as much as he knows, hes simply doesn't have it in him. I can always ask and he will tell me but for a guy learning, there's no much teaching involved. He sits on his computer and reads up on many things. I ask him about designing and he tells me that will come with experience. Hes very knowledgeable in a scary way where he does everything in his head and doesn't use software, but I can't hold a candle to him. He does ask me questions and gets my input on troublehooting and problem solving, but its not enough.

2) 

My qualifications. 

I went to a 3 year college program which does have some RF  classes in the curriculum, but I mainly know from an educational background. Work experience is very limited. Work experince wise I only had a few months in RF. I believe the main reason they hired me is because I did a contract with a company they work very closely to. I mainly worked on the cell towers upgrading their old equipment to LTE and 5g ready. Thats it and that was only 4 month project. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) I really think they see me as a superhero but they didn't make sure i could fly. 

While I do obviously have RF some knowledge to pass a test to be hired in the first place (other company) but im really green.  If they sat me down and asked how AM/FM/duplexers/combiners/ multiplexers/ das systems work... i can give a pretty decent explanation. But if they said, Hey Eric we need you to design this system to have this much coverage. I can give a very basic answer but choosing the type of antenna, determining how the stucture of the building will annenuate the signal in certain regions, How much signal strength it will have, whats in the rooms, thickness of walls, desks, computers, metal cabinets... factoring all those variables is completely beyond me... i really don't know how to calculate or consider. I know some but not enough.

&amp;#x200B;

4) the other employees (techs) are more qualified. 

My supervisor and the other 2 techs been in this field longer than me and we all have the same education.  I told them when they first told me my role is to replace teh RF engineer I can't replace an engineer. Thats not what I am. While my previous work in the past had a lot of designing to do, it wasn't on this scale. My colleagues went to the same college and one has a better GPA.... he apparently was never asked or mentioned this oppertunity. So why me? I know I never lie on my resume, so they can clearly see we share the same education. 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all im always trying to learn as much as i can to catch up to our RF engineer ( even taking  year post grad course next year  that specializes in wireless and telecom) 5k my money just to get better, but I feel im not what they think i am and this guy can retire any time and when he does I may not be ready.

For example, I've noticed in this impressive screenshots from the Catia files of what was going to be [Caterham's 2015 F1 entry](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4kPESfWcAE1NoV.jpg) that they've pretty much modelled the full car, and each component or sub assemblies is assigned a different colour. I noticed that with a screenshot from [the 2010 Mclaren Catia model](https://joesaward.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dassault-systemes-1.jpg) as well. Is that to distinguish the different part files designed by the different members of staff when put together in the final product/assembly file?

Also, since I'm assuming, multiple people work on different parts of the car, and then they export their part files to some sort of master product file where the full assembly is made, how do people design their part if a surface or some kind of geometry is dependant on another part being designed by a different department? For example, someone designing the the front wing and nosecone assembly, the geometry of the back surface of that part is going to be determined by the front bulkhead or vice versa, so how can they reference the bulkhead geometry which might not have been designed yet to know how their front nosecone assembly will fix to the car and what that corresponding geometry for their part will look like?

Finally, it blows my mind how they have modelled the full car down to each component and going as for as all the wiring, connectors, sensors and piping etc. But how do they model parts that they aren't designing and come from an external source? The main one being the engine, for customer teams in Formula 1. Would Renault (the company which Caterham would have bought engines from them at the time) have sent over their CAD files to Caterham, although im guessing that would lead to problems if one company used Catia while the other used Siemens NX? Or for example modelling things like fuel injectors or spark plugs, fairly insignificant components relative to what Caterham staff (for this example) will be modelling and manufacturing themselves but obviously need to know dimensions and specs so they can work out how those parts will be installed all together, I guess an example of this is when there was a miscomunication between the Honda and Mclaren engineers and I believe the gearbox wouldn't mate to the engine correctly due to incorrect location/dimensions for the locating bolts, requiring Mclaren to get a drawing from Honda so they could redesign and manufacture the correct part which was filmed during the series filmed for Amazon Prime.

As someone who thinks modelling something as simple as a brake caliper or wheel to an acceptable standard that would look like a proper retail part, seeing these insane assemblies of a full race car being modelled in Catia down to every component just blows me away and to be honest, makes me feel a bit overwhelmed seeing the complexity and standard of real-world industry CAD models for assemblies and projects like the ones I showed.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am a 1st year student at a great school studying this degree: Product Development and Innovation in Engineering. 

I love technology and interesting ways to construct things, and I just really like the idea of being an engineer. However, I could not decide specifically what kind. That is why I chose this degree because it essentially combines all types of engineering and throws some economics and business into the mix as well. It features mechanical engineering and design, materials, innovation, business economics and later on, we will get into software engineering, sensors and electronics, and robotics. 

My problem is that after 3 months I began to notice that it is very basic in every single field and subject, and provides quite a shallow knowledge. It also seems a lot like it is designed to teach more about the business part rather than the technical part. I cannot tell if I am overreacting or jump to conclusions too early. 

My question is: How does one get an engineering job with such shallow knowledge, and also what are my options?

* Make precise drawings. Manufacture.
* Release. Gather user feedback, introduce modifications to the design. Release a new version.

With ramp up of the computer industry, large manufactures in 1970's started adopting numerical methods in various stages of the process: design, numerical simulation, manufacturing, data management.

This gave birth to the CAD/CAM/CAE/PDM industry – Computer-aided Design, Manufacturing, Analysis and Product Data Management. Later on an umbrella term – PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) – was invented to encompass all these areas.

There are numerous large/medium/small generic CAD/CAM/CAE systems and specific ones focused on particular problem domains. The latter can cover PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design, water/gas turbines, consumer products (such as shoes or even cardboard boxes), you name it.

When the industry was ramping up it was moving from traditional 2D data, such as drawing which is simpler, to 3D, which is able to transmit design ideas between humans much easier. This brought an obvious question - how can we mathematically describe that 3D data? This leads us to part 2 of our series.

55,A lot of Force in a very short time. What actuator type?,1574970872,"Hi Engineers, 

I am trying to build a fatigue testing machine that does not cost an arm and a leg. 
The goal is to apply 50 Tons of force in a duration of 0.25 to 0.5 seconds to a piece of metal and then release this force is about the same time. 
This process has to happen at 1 or 2 Hz. 
The displacement (springy action) of the metal specimen is a maximum of 2 mm. Any more than that is not possible (except with higher force). 

I need some guidance on what type of actuator I would need to apply this much force in such a short time. 
I tried looking at hydraulic cylinders. Putting out 50 tons is certainly possible, but I am not sure about speed. It would depend on the flow rate at maximum pressure of the hydraulic pump and the fluid displacement in the cylinder. I cooked up a nice excel sheet to calculate these: 
- with a 6 inch bore cylinder at 4000 PSI, I have to have a hydraulic pump that has a 5 GPM of flow rate at 4000 PSI... This would give me 4.32 mm per second of piston travel at 4000 PSI. 
This is certainly a solution, but what I am worried about is if a hydraulic system can last millions of test cycles. 

I have looked at piezoelectric actuators, but the displacement is maximum of 200 um (micrometer). Not enough... 

I am looking for any and all suggestions.

I'm doing Engineering cause I like it and it's pretty close to physics, really did it cause I know there aren't jobs for any physics b.s. people if I decided against grad school. Going to industry after PhD.

Hi all,

I'm at a critical point in my undergraduate degree(s) where I need to decide which I need to put first. I'm firstly and have been a Mechanical Engineering student wanting to dual degree in Physics and eventually and up in Graduate school studying Nuclear Theory. That's where my passion lies, it's where I have the most enjoyment in problems and where I enjoy learning. I learn Nuclear Theory in my off time after teaching myself a majority of the math needed. 

A critical issue is that when scheduling my classes my physics classes push me back to nearly 6 years, 5 currently if scheduling worked in my favor. My Physics department will take some engineering classes in lieu of physics classes, such as intermediate mechanics with Engineering statics and dynamics etc. With that alternate scheduling I look at 5 years all in all total. But if I take those classes in lieu of the original physics class assigned , graduate schools would state that I would not have the requisite classes to be admitted.  

All in all this is where I have ended up but have realized after some searching that Nuclear Theory isn't really doing much hiring, even so not many positions are looking for physicists. So my question is, is it better to leave my physics passion to the side in order for a better career and go the path of a Mechanical Engineering P.h.D.? It seems like Engineering as a field won't be slowing down anytime soon, and I'm sure an Mechanical Engineering P.h.D. is more hireable than a Physics P.h.D.

\-I have been out of university since May but received my actual degree (bachelor of mechanical engineering) at the beginning of November.

\-During my time a University I was fortunate enough to get really good internship experience at a pretty good company in the bay area.

I also did some work with injection molding, most of this was done using CREO PTC.

So my question is what can I do to make myself stick out more, from the feedback I have gotten I have been told my resume is pretty good. I actually got an interview at Apple last week, I think it went pretty well. But I don't think I'll be moving onto the next step of the interview process because the interviewer made it pretty clear he was looking for someone with 2-3 years of CNC experience, which I don't have.

I was told he would be a mentor for me when I was hired since he knows a lot about the product and processes but always says ""I'm not sure"" to even basic questions about the product or any technical questions. This has been going on since I started and I tried to have a talk with him about how I want guidance from him since he has a lot I can learn from and he said ""Yes, that's important""  but he's still refusing to do anything. He will always tell management that I never asked him or that he's open to helping me always despite the fact he never is. I've asked him to show me how to do certain testing or procedures 8 or more times but he always says he has other things to do, then he goes and does the task when I am away at lunch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm only a new engineer and the company seems to be providing no resources or documentation to help me in my development, then blaming me when I struggle with a task saying that he is my resource since we have no documentation for some things. But he will always avoid my questions and they told me to ask questions more persistently and eventually he'll crack and tell me what I want to know.  Some of the people at work have told me he always passes his work off on people when he can and throws them under the bus when things don't work out when he looks bad.

The past few months my manager has been hauling me into sessions on either a weekly or daily basis, where I review what tasks I have going on. I get a harsh berating with regards to progress of any ongoing tasks, then get some optimistic deadlines which I am pressured to agreeing to (even if I state that I don't want to commit to the date because it is unrealistic). I am told that I don't understand process, don't show accountability, and don't communicate effectively. My manager is regularly implying that I should work more hours, and implying that I might not be able to meet deadlines if I go ahead with my scheduled upcoming days off.

It is quite a bottleneck in the programme at the moment, as parts are being manufactured and along with regular design work I have a lot of manufacturing issues to resolve. I regularly report to 4 people (two project managers, one engineering manager, and a chief engineer). 

It's clear my manager is frustrated with my performance. My chance of promotion was thrown out months ago. My monthly catch-up meetings are overwhelmingly negative, and for the past couple of months I have been regularly threatened with a formal disciplinary should my performance not improve.

The field is Civil Engineering

out of school I worked for one engineering firm for about 4.5 years, moved to a new state, and have been working for a different engineering firm for about 2.5 years.

Main Issue:

I recently completed the paperwork for my PE exam application and gave the work experience page for my current job to my boss to sign off on. After a quick review he said that he did not think he would be able to sign off as he said I've ""only done two reports since (I've) been here."" I was instantly taken aback because I've worked on many more than 2 reports since I have been at this company, all of which were reviewed by him. I promptly provided him a list of all the reports which I have written since being at this company, he replied by basically saying ""I don't believe you"" and asked me to print out the signed cover page for each report showing my signature, which I did. I also said that if he was not comfortable signing off on the amount of time I had indicated that I would accept that, but to simply let me know how much time he felt was appropriate for the amount of work I've done. After a review of those reports he then asked me to explain the ""gaps"" in time between some of the reports. I pointed out that I had performed other engineering work such as helping with other engineers reports, construction inspection, field investigation, laboratory work etc. He then claimed that those items didn't count toward PE experience and therefore he couldn't sign off on the amount of time I put down. I tried to, as politely as possible, point out that the PE application itself for the state in which I am applying explicitly include those activities as ""Practicing Engineering"".

The final communication was basically him telling me that he wasn't going to look at it anymore before going on vacation in which he will be gone until January and blamed me for not getting it to him sooner. I would agree accept I did not know he was going on this long vacation as he never told me about it and there is still about a month left before the application deadline which I felt was an acceptable (thought not ideal) amount of time.

He has been hostile with me like this for about the last two months, when he asked if we could have a private meeting and basically accused me of not contributing anything to the company (which, I feel the need to reiterate, is not true. Even in my down time I am always looking for ways to help/improve our processes and procedures). Prior to this we had a very friendly relationship and he had always indicated that he was happy with the work I've been doing. The only thing I can think of as to why he would have become so hostile is because my timesheet has been looking pretty sparse, but that is fairly normal for my company and I know that most of the other engineers are in the same boat as me.

tl;dr: a boss that I was previously friendly with suddenly became hostile and is soft refusing to sign off on my work experience because it's not ""acceptable engineering experience"" despite it being demonstrably so.

As the title states, I've been a manufacturing engineer for 3 years in the aerospace industry and I'm thinking of shifting my career path towards something that better suits my interests. 

My degree is in manufacturing engineering with a focus on design and CNC machining, in school I LOVED my CAD/CAM classes, robotics, and my extracurricular involvement in Formula SAE.

In college I had the most fun working on FSAE suspension system design which included modeling, design, finite element analysis, assembly modeling, and CNC machining of the front and rear suspension assemblies. 



In industry, I've found that manufacturing engineering (at least at my company) seems to be 5% actual engineering (CAM/tooling design, process design) and 95% mundane documentation BS and ""I need you to fix this immediately, we need to ship these catastrophically broken parts today.""
It's all about shipping the most product possible at the expense of the wellbeing of the employees, and I am not interested in supporting that.

5,[ME] Which field to go into: manufacturing or testing?,1574866479,"I'll be graduating in December with a BSME, and I'm finishing up my job search. I have one offer from a Tier 1 supplier to the automotive industry, I anticipate an offer from a company that primarily crash tests vehicles, and I'm waiting to hear back from a Japanese automotive OEM.

I'm fortunate to have made it this far (both in terms of school and job search), but if I get other offers, this will be a tough decision to make. Obviously I like all three companies, but I have to think long-term too. 

From what I can tell, the manufacturing engineering job market is alot more rich than that of the engineering jobs that do more data collection/measurements/testing. However, it is also a lot more 'ebb and flow' with the economy. I really don't have enough *actual* exposure to both fields to make a fair comparison outside of coursework and a few summer internships with regard to which I like more. I *think* I like MFG engineering (long term, too) better than the testing side of things, but really I don't have anything to point to as for why.

Despite what I've heard about the automotive industry, right now it's looking like that's the long term goal. There are a good amount of jobs in the automotive industry for both of these fields.

8,Need advice on how to proceed.,1574859030,"I work at a chemical plant currently as a process engineer. I’ve been here a little over 6 months and graduated back in May (ME). Last summer I did an internship here at the plant with the reliability group and loved it! But they only had a process engineer job available when I started. After working on the production side for about 4 months I told my boss (very professionally) that the production side doesn’t really interest me and I feel I would be more effective in a maintenance/reliability role. He agreed and said he’d see what he could do to get things moving that direction. 

Last week I had my pre year end review with him and he asked how I thought I was doing. I told him what I had accomplished for the year and that I felt I was doing very well. His opinion is that a lot of the things I completed were more geared towards maintenance activities and will not be considered in my year end review and that makes me a below average employee. He has only been a manager a couple months longer than I’ve been here and I think he is seeing my mechanical work as “maintenance activities” (I am the only mechanical that works in this group the rest are chemical). I’m still not sure what he wants me to work on because he doesn’t know my area well enough to give me suggestions, but I am improving production and reliability of my area by addressing mechanical issues (which is why they hired a ME). I feel that he is trying to compare me to chemical engineers directly which is a lot like comparing apples to oranges as their areas concerns are very different from mine. He also said there has been no talk of me moving to reliability that he has heard but the reliability manager seems to be working on something but has to “find the money”.

so here are the numbers:
the chain block is rated 2000kgs and that is for a full vertical lift taking 100% of the weight off the ground.
my car only weighs approximately 1800kgs. I know on level ground the manual block could pull my car since its not taking the full weight of the vehicle it would be rolling on its wheels.
The confusing part is when i add in the mud condition, now obviously every mudhole is different and will all have different amouts of traction and suction but are there any loose estimates we can work with here to find out what capacity the block would need to be to pull my 4wd out.

22,2nd Masters in Robotics... Should I do it?!,1574824274,"Hey guys,
so I recently graduated from the most prestigious engineering university in Portugal. Being top 5% of the masters on Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a major in Systems, Control and Decision.

However, right now I am having a hard time finding a job in the field of robotics. The market in Portugal sucks! Its almost only Consultancy and IT. Most of my friends are going to IT and Data Science, and I hate that idea, of studying so many interesting engineering subjects, and ending up in a job that someone who took computer science can easily feel in. It isnt engineering.

I am reaching the conclusion that I need to go to another country to find this job. I am thinking about germany, since I am close to advanced in the language and it has great engineering and pays well.

So my idea is to reapply to a masters in germany, focused on robotics. In that way, after the 2 years it will be easier to find a job there. My plan is to try to become a top student. Since I have already learned some of the subjects it will be easier. I will also try to do some projects or have a stundent job in the area in order to enhance my cv.

For me it seems like a perfect plan. It is like a fresh start. My only concern is the fact that i will be repeating some subjects, and ""lose"" some time. But I feel like this route will give me better chances than staying in Portugal on a shitty job. Much more difficultly will a company want to hire me to a job in the area of robotics in germany.

I do not have enough knowledge on this area. So I wouldnt be probably able to find a nice job in robotics in Portugal (i will try, though). And it is Portugal, we are not well known for our engineering. I feel like the way you start your career is very important. If you start and go to a shitty job, there's a very low chance that you will you be ever able to enter a nice elite job (or it will take forever). However, if you graduate with amazing grades, very easily will you be accepted on a great position. And now, it will be easier to find another high position. You are inside the bubble.

So what do you guys think of my plan? 2nd masters in robotics in germany -&gt; get great grades -&gt; find good job

If I stay in Portugal I fell like the route would be:
find shitty/mediocre robotics job (and i am lucky if i can) -&gt;... -&gt; no exciting job in robotics in germany (maybe only 10 years later) 

I don't know, it seems more efficient the 1st route, and I am more excited about it. Some masters seem very interesting. But I also fear that the 2nd master may hinder me in some way. I dont know. The recruiters may see that I took a 2nd Masters and prefer a student who didnt need a 2nd one.

I am the type of person who is excellent with memorizing details and can somehow ""wing it"" in major assignments/exams - I get decent grades by comparing and contrasting my memorized knowledge with whatever's thrown at my face. I am good at understanding how numbers and the ugliest equations work out to explain the world.

Programming, on the other hand, has many different implementations for one required outcome. Open-endedness is needed to meet tight constraints. I need more hand-holding in programming than engineering. Whenever there's a bug I don't know how to fix it - I've noticed effective programmers are excellent with debugging. I wish debugging was just as easy as applying the right equations at the right times with predictability.

At this rate, I am sure I couldn't handle IT/IS majors - which are supposed to be easier than STEM majors. Forget ECE majors. If it was possible, I could teach myself engineering at home or get into an engineering bootcamp (without getting a degree/proper college background) and be prepared for a legit engineering job...but I would need extra hand-holding to teach myself programming at home or get into a coding bootcamp. Maybe I would have failed in a coding bootcamp or teaching myself programming at home.

45,Looking for software to simulate high-frequency EM wave propagation in a medium (for example a room),1574768140,"I recently started a new job at University, and I have to research different software for EM field propagation. The idea is that I have an antenna which sends out a wave. Now I want to be able to simulate the propagation of this wave in the medium in which it is located (for example, if the antenna is in an empty box I wanna see the way the waves propagate around the box). 

Has anyone here used something similar or can give me some leads for further research?

Anyway, sob story aside (no, I'm not self-pitying anymore; I've got a plan to get out): I've found that my true interest lies in engineering, specifically forward vehicle lighting. I love reading SAE papers about headlamp development, etc. I could probably drop enough terms to impress an actual engineer, graves' shield, luminous efficacy not efficiency, etc.

I've been admitted to UCF and I put my major as mechanical engineering. I chose M.E. because ME is pretty broad...which means I have the option of working in a ton of different fields after graduation instead of being locked into just a few narrow fields. And a bachelor's in ME is useful, unlike, say, a bachelor's in biomedical engineering, which necessitates a Master's or PHD for real opportunities (from what I understand).

However, I just learned that UCF is home to CREOL, and they offer an undergrad degree in optics/photonics. I'm wondering should I just drop mechanical engineering and go whole-hog on my interest in vehicle lighting and get a degree in optics/photonics? But, here are my thoughts/questions:

I want to move out ASAP. My concern is that with optics/photoronics, I'll need a Master's or PHD to actually get some real jobs in the field.

52,Unsure about Enticing Job posting and Travel requirements,1574744399,"Hello, Ask Engineering!

I am a mechanical engineer (2 years out from college) working for a chemical engineering company in SoCal. The plant that I am currently at distributes process materials to Aerospace customers across the world. My time at my company has given me a lot of knowledge and experience over the past two years, but earlier this year I thought it maybe time for me to start looking for better opportunities. After beefing up my resume and LinkedIn, I've been steadily looking and applying to jobs in my area, getting a 5 - 6 phone interviews and 2 in person interviews in total. 

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, I was approached from a recruiter on LinkedIn for job position with a rather enticing salary range. I agreed to speak with the recruiter about the position over the phone and was enlightened on what the job position actually was (here is the job posting that was sent to me [Description Page 1](https://ibb.co/5YC6P7M) [Description Page 2](https://ibb.co/xS22kX6)). My background does not match AT ALL with the job description, but the recruiter insisted me that I would be trained extensively if I was offered the position. I agreed to scheduled have a phone interview with the Engineering Manager of said company, which I just had today. From what the manager described the job to be, it seemed more of a maintenance job than an engineering job. So, I come to /r/AskEngineers with a few questions:

&amp;nbsp;

1. After reading the description of the job position, does this seem more like a travel heavy maintenance role rather than a engineering role? Am I being tricked by a job title to apply for a maintenance role?

2. For anyone who is a pressure vessel engineer, what is it like and what is the travel situation like? This job is being described to be 40% travel, with assignments being as long as 1 to 2 months at a time. The travel requirements (along with not knowing anything about the field) has made very hesitant with inquiring further.

3. For anyone with similar experience to the job, how is the learning curve for some one with little to 0 experience in this field? Would it be hard to grasp if I didn't have prior knowledge or intern experience?

&amp;nbsp;

Any recommendations, personal experiences, or advice would be very helpful.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - Engineer currently looking for better oppourtunity. Was reached by recruiter on LinkedIn with a job with very good pay. Unsure if I match the position and requirements.

I did alot of setup and breaking down lab equipment, calibrating, verifying, and data gathering. It was a cool job but the pay sucked (contract, $19/hr) but there was plenty of OT. Well, 7 months later I'm out due to conflicts of pay, getting signed on from contract to full-time, and getting into it with the Ops. Manager regarding them hiring two employees full-time who have 0 background in engineering (He didnt like how his employees with their EE would leave after 2 years to the local Raytheon). 

I currently live back in the Central Valley of California aka everything from Stockton down to Fresno. (Former Bulldog) so theres alot of civil engineering/construction projects and alot of PLC/Automation jobs at the local big companies. I have an opportunity to become a Construction Estimator working one-on-one with a guy trying to expand his General Construction company here.

It's late November so of course, I'm not having an easy time hearing back from employers in addition to the fact that I dont have too much experience under my belt.

I've studied at a top 5 engineering school in Europe and I've gotten an offer to join McKinsey (Business Analyst). A bit of background, I will have an engineering degree (graduate this summer) and hold an Indian passport. I've grown up in a gulf country but I do not speak arabic.

I do also have an offer to join a medtech company in the UK that I absolutetly love. It's an offer to join them as a graduate engineer and they are willing to sponser my visa. I strongly prefer living in the UK. It was a massive hurdle finding a company willing to sponser my UK work permit, I've worked with them over the summer and loved them.

I'm quite frankly shocked I got through the process however I don't have a choice about the office location. I've heard lots of things about Saudi that are a little unsettling. Furthermore, I am 100% certain I want to be an engineer and will go back to engineering following the BA track. I also have an SO in the UK who I will be doing long distance with.

Is this worth accepting? I don't know much about business but I've heard the McK training is phenomenal and I will be flying around the world for the next 2 years. I'm excited about that however I am hesitant about losing all of my friends and dealing with an LDR. I'm also concerned about the middle east thing. On the other hand, this is the time of my life to do something crazy like this (I'm in my early 20s). I know I want to go into MedTech but I think the experience might be useful.

17,PM/Engineer in awkward position at work.,1574628512,"So a bit of background. I was hired as a Project Manager for a small manufacturer of consumer goods 8mths ago. They are amazing at marketting and sales but have had longstanding issues with quality and defects which I did not realize upon joining.

As a PM I am responsible for warranty projects as well as the regular kind. Every time one comes up the problem is obvious, the solution is obvious. So I end up up micromanaging to make it happen. At first there was some resistance but once the staff realized my solutions always worked, they started being more supportive.

In about July, one of the owners started taking notice and then gave me a problem to solve every now and then, which I would solve diligently. Meanwhile my boss, the senior PM has grown defensive over his use of my time and bypassing the chain of command. Nothing overtly aggressive, but it's made me think twice.

Anyway so now I'm facing a few dilemnas:

* My boss's boss, the owner, keeps asking me questions which I keep giving ballpark figures too which frustrates me and makes me feel a bit gross tbqh; I would much rather do a rigorous FEA using computer assisted engineering rather than do a few back of the envelope calculations. While the design team has a variety of CAD and CAE software (which they don't use) I can only do things by hand. Also he is one of those types of people who prefers an innacurate answer now, rather than a precise answer tomorrow. I'm worried that one day this is going to blow up in my face and no amount of generous safety factor is going to cut it.
* I'm constantly torn between my job and going out of my way to advise the design team. At the very least so that their new designs don't eventually end up in my lap as warranty jobs. I do also find it to be more interesting work.
* I'd rather they would just ""promote"" me as their engineer. I don't know how to really approach my boss or my boss's boss about this though. It is a delicate political situation and I don't want to fuck it up.

29,This is really bothering me (Xeon vs i9),1574604797," 

I am having a hard time deciding on two laptop's for a workflow predominately consisting of FDE (ANSYS), and CAD (SolidWorks). With my current experience level I may not utilize all of the resources in either of the two configurations I have listed below, however I wanted something I could keep for a while and grow into since usually ThinkPad's have very good longevity.

The decision making obstacle I am running into is prioritizing either the graphics card or the processor since I can not have both in the same machine. Unfortunately Lenovo did not pair the top i9 8-core with the RTX 5000, I am assuming due to thermal constraints. In order to have the RTX 5000 you are limited to the latest 6-core Xeon or the 6-core i7. To get the i9 8-core, you are limited to the RTX 4000 Max-Q or lower card.

Here are my two options I have it refined down to, and any insight based on my workflow would be appreciated:

**Option 1**

\- 2.3 GHz Intel Core i9-9880H Eight-Core

\- 64GB DDR4 &amp; 1TB SSD

\- NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 Max-Q (8GB)

**Option 2**

\- 2.8GHz Intel Core Xeon E-2276M Six-Core

\- 64GB DDR4 &amp; 1TB SSD

\- NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 Max-Q (16GB)&lt;-----will i even benefit from 16GB?

So I have the second option right now, however I am within my return period if option one is the better value. Should I keep the Xeon or swap it out for the RTX 4000 and i9? Lets also assume we are leaving my experience and skill out of the equation to make it easier. Lets just base this purley on the capability of each workstation and not my capability.

Which one would you go with? Did I mess up grabbing the Xeon? Or was prioritizing the RTX 5000 with a 6-core processor the better choice?

I have a guess which is the pieces that comprise the pillar are simply held by the friction between the piece below and the piece above. I guess there is no adhesive.

Another way could be to carve a notch in one piece and a hole in another, thus the pillar would have a locking mechanism between the pieces making it more safe than relying on friction alone.

My guess for the beams is that it's made of a single piece, with them sitting on only half of the pillar, to allow a neighbouring beam to sit on the other half.

We're sort of in the initial stages and trying to decide which method would work best. I know this sub has a no-homework rule and think I should make it clear that this is not in any way related to anything I'm doing in class. It's entirely outside of school and I'm getting no grade for it. 

Obviously there are already devices on the market with the same capabilities but they are quite expensive. We're aiming for under $200 each bathroom. Those devices on the market seem to be detecting the chemicals in the vapor for very high accuracy and low chance of false positives. My first question is, is there any way of finding out what these chemicals are that we would be able to pick up on and how exactly would we detect those chemicals.

Our second idea was to use a photoelectric sensor like in smoke alarms to detect the vapor. From what I've seen, vaping devices are capable of setting off smoke alarms but are a lot less likely to than cigarettes. This is especially a problem since the most popular vaping device, Juul, doesn't emit as much vapor as the less portable ones that are less common with high schoolers. My second question is, how would we make a photoelectric sensor more sensitive to vapor and would we need more than just one per bathroom?

43,Re-introducing engineering design to a company that outsources engineering design,1574559204,"I'm mechanical engineering recent graduate working for a pressure vessel manufacturer for almost 2 years now. 

The company has been running from the early 80s until now manufacturing large assets for the oil and gas industry. From the day the company started until 2014 they always had design engineers working there until management decided to stop supporting design. 

The way things were done back then is that the company's design engineer will size the equipment during the quotations stage and then she/he will pass the information to the estimators to give the client an accurate quote. In-house design engineers used to also look after projects for clients with strict requirements such as Exxon. All other designs were outsourced if our engineers were overloaded. 

A few years after the company decided to stop supporting engineering design and our last design engineer left in 2014, they realised it was huge mistake. The consequence for the loss include but not limited to the following:

(1) No more equipment sizing during quotation. We have to beg our design subcontractors to give us preliminary calcs and promise them that if we win the job, they win the job.
(2) Engineering knowledge lost and therefore there is no one to update our spreadsheets.
(3) The cost for outsourcing design has become very expensive because clients are no longer satisfied with a few lines of formulas. Design reports these days are expected to be very detailed compared to the 80s and 90s. 
(4) Our design engineers used to know by heart our major clients engineering specifications. Even if a design was outsourced they can easily identify a mistake without going through the spec. However now its not the case, we have to spend a lot of time going through specs. 

We also had an expensive software called PV Elite for pressure vessel design and sizing. The software will only work if a dongle is connected to the PC however the company lost the dongle a few years ago. 

Now the company is left with project managers and estimators only and our only engineering resources now are a bunch of spreadsheets. 

The company gave me the task to put forward steps to re-introduce engineering design to the company and learn engineering design myself. However, I'm finding it extremely difficult because there is no senior support or knowledge. I have already started 6 months ago but since I'm too wrapped up with other work duties, I can't put my complete focus into it. I'm also investing a lot of time from home to learn design but again since there is no senior support it's taking some time. I enjoy learning it and engineering design is a career path that I want to take but I'm not sure how to keep moving forward. 

Apologies for the long post, I just wanted to give you guys an idea about the background of the problem. Therefore the question(s) are: What would a company in our situation do to re-introduce in-house engineering design? Is there any steps that may be taken?

The worm wheel is constrained that way and so is the worm, so it seems quite intentional, however I would expect the center axis of the worm to align with the centerline of the worm wheel teeth and not the edge.

I interned at a big company during my final year of studies and got offered a full time position as a graduate Project engineer.

The company I work for specialises in building automation and uses very specific types of programming and software. I've only been in this role for 3 months. I worry that if I work in this role for too long, I'm narrowing myself into a very niche field which may affect my future job options if I wanted to do something else. 

I am interested in HVAC and it's a lot more common and applicable in basically everywhere. Is it way too soon for me to start looking? Should I give this job more time? 

My pros and cons of staying vs leaving:

Pros of staying: decent pay, steady job, lots of infrastructure within company due to its large size (fortune 500)

Cons: staying in a niche field from the very start of my career and possibly closing other options I could've done, my team is very understaffed yet I'm not given much to do because everyone is too busy to properly train me, my mentor who took me under his wing has left the company and I'm kind of left out to dry at the moment as no one knows what to do with me now. 

Pros of moving to HVAC: a more flexible field that is easier to move around in due to how common it is, better for my career outlook if it goes well, smaller company means more things I can learn

Cons of moving to HVAC: the companies are much smaller which might mean less stability

τ=Tc/J 

I understand all the individual parts, how to calculate J and what to do if the shaft is hollow or solid or not circular. But I have 2 issues. 

First off, all the examples I find online are for students so they have a shaft with known torque being applied at various points along it and then they’re asked to work out the shear stress. How do I, in real life, find out how much torque a shaft is experiencing?

Secondly, what’s the point of this equation. Am I supposed to check the ultimate tensile strength of the shaft material, roughly work out the ultimate shear strength and check to see whether the shaft will break when under those forces? Would I need to find the smallest possible diameter of the shaft, and if so how because I won’t have a “maximum allowable shear stress” like in the exams. Why would we need to work this out?

4,Calculate FTIR-system response functions from measurements of a calibrated black body,1574404470,"Hi all

First, this is a crosspost from StackExchange - Engineering. I couldn't find help there yet so I'm turning to reddit.

 [https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/32031/calculate-ftir-system-response-functions-from-measurements-of-a-calibrated-black](https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/32031/calculate-ftir-system-response-functions-from-measurements-of-a-calibrated-black) 

I'll just repeat the what I wrote there, but note that on the SE post I've also put some images.

I need to find the response of my FTIR spectrometer. I do have a calibrated black-body source (area-emitter) which I measured at various temperatures.

The system operates in inverse cm, cm-1. My approach so far was the following:

* 1) Measure spectra at temperatures Ti
* 2) Scale the spectra i.e.
   * the x-axis x(in um)=1e4/x(in cm−1)
   * the y-axis, y(in um)=y(in cm−1)/x(in cm)\^2 to account for the dispersion relation between measured inverse cm spacing and desired wavelength spectrum.
* 3) calculate the response function R=RadBlackBody(Ti)/y(Ti)   (I think, here in a first approach I assume that the background radiation does not contribute significantly. I would have expected similar response functions for the different temperatures. However, I observe that this ""response function"" drifts with temperature. I am unsure now if I have a misconception in the defintion of the response function, or if I picked up an experimental artefact. I hope someone with more experience can help me out?

I am a 23 year old Biomedical Engineer with 1 year experience as a Jr. Engineer at a small medical device company. I left that company in recent months, and have been job searching for about 2 months now.

So now I have 2 career options right now:

1. Work for a smaller (30ish employees), not nearly as renown medical device company for a very generous starting salary as a full-time employee. Live at home and save up a ton of cash (I still live with my parents, and the company is local). Gain great overall experience, as I would be involved with pretty much every aspect of the engineering process.
2. Work for one of the largest medical device companies in the world as a Quality Engineer on a contract position, and then (likely) eventually full-time.

I would have to relocate about 2 hours away, and pay all my living expenses myself. I would only receive experience in quality engineering, but at the leader in the industry.

23,My company has once again failed to change my salary with a new title and role. Looking for the best way to handle this.,1574374300,"  

Stay with me as this can get confusing. 

This is the second company I have worked for out of college. I decided to make a career change, so I accepted a job in a different industry. That job started with a 6 month training program. I have been with company X for about a year now. 

Upon accepting the offer, the company’s training program started you at Y salary for 6 months. And in the HR forms, it stated my final salary would be discussed after completion of the program. And you would get put in a permanent role. 

Fast forward to completing the program. I get placed in a temporary role to learn a specific technology a bit deeper and replace someone on a special assignment for 6 months. I get a formal letter stating my salary during this time will stay the same, and it will be re-evaluated after those 6 months. Essentially my training program is elongated due to learning more specific tech.  Fine. 

Fast forward to now. I get a formal offer letter for my PERMANENT role (finally) stating my salary will be kept the same. And come April 2020 I will eligible for a salary increase. 

Long story short-I’ve been with this company almost a year, HR forms keep stating I will get a pay bump, but it keeps getting delayed. Now it isn’t until April 2020. I really like this industry and the company/people, but I don’t want to be blinded by the fact I keep having to wait for a pay bump.

What’s the best way to handle &amp; negotiate this? I’m quite disappointed, but I want to hopefully frame my wishes and frustrations correctly to get my (in my opinion) deserved pay bump.

- I’ve been told that a big issue with these programs is that there is no way to store and auto generate a piece mark after an initial item is created. In other words if a plate “2p234” is created and is needed on multiple items in multiple projects a detailer is not able to “drag and drop “ that piece everywhere needed, the detailer will need to manually make those changes.

I had my year end meeting with my boss yesterday and while I went in excited, I came out frustrated and pissed as I have every year for the past 12+. I quit a company that I was at for 6 years because every year, despite stellar performance reviews and taking on a ridiculous amount of work and OT I kept getting puny, insulting raises. I had worked my way up to a lead position with up to 8 people working on my projects underneath me, but the sub $1/hr raise kept coming. I finally quit thinking it was an anomaly and that I would do better for kept l myself elsewhere.



So I got on with the company I'm at currently a year ago. Like the other place, I've had very good reviews so year, my new boss has thrown about 50 different things that he wants me to ""own"" which I have successfully juggled. I thought a nice bump in pay was surely in the books. 



I couldn't have been more wrong. In the 15 minute year end meeting I had with my boss yesterday, he made 3 things very clear: my performance is top notch, they want to make me a lead, and my raise is only going to be ""cost of living"" aka about 95 cents.



I'm really feeling like giving up and leaving the industry all together. This industry is way too stressful to justify cost of living raises on an already not super impressive salary. I've never felt so underappreciated and I think it's finally broke me.

\- Good source for online mid-level (200/300) mechanical engineering courses?

42,An international aerospace engineering student needing help to decide his future.,1574353744,"Hello everyone, it's my first post here and is an extremely important one. I really need to hear what people have to say.

I am an international aerospace student studying at a university that is not in my home country, and is a very good one. But I am from a North African country, with a reputation that isn't all that good.

Recently it has been brought to my attention that the aerospace industry usually hires people from their own countries, and if it were from another country, then it would be from reputable ones (Europe America etc), so I am worried for my future, finding a job etc.

What do you think I should do? Anything I can do to make me standout in the market? Should I change my major to mechanical? (Even though i am passionate about aerospace engineering)

Every single tip would be a help.

As of now, I have declared electrical engineering as my minor and perhaps that might be enough to get my foot in the door with a company that doesn't necessarily pertain to biotechnology.

77,Need help calculating dimensions of aerofoil based on self pitching mechanism.,1574279221," Hi! I am a student from Sweden that is doing a project in school where we are trying to build a VAWT (Vertical Axis Wind Turbine) . We are trying to implement self pitching blades but cant find any information about how to accomplish this. There are many alternatives which to build one with gears but not with Central Gravity and aerodynamic forces as the main component. Below is a crop out from a paper that describes the principle of self adjustment. The problem we are having is that we cant find any information on how to actually design a blade with this property. Does anyone know how to design a blade or aerofoil with this property? 

""The self-adjusting blade pitch mechanism described herein is based on the centrifugal positioning and the lift adjustment during operation of wind turbine blades.  The blade CG (center of gravity) is at the nose, and it is hinged to the round-arm of the turbine wheel.  The centrifugal force of the blade is balanced by the centripetal force generated by the roundarm. Since the blade nose and round-arm is on a straight line, the chord would be perpendicular to the round-arm. The action that the blade maintains itself to be perpendicular to the round-arm by the centrifugal force is called centrifugal positioning. When the angle b between wind direction and blade is larger than the best pitch angle a, the lift will pull the blade to a counter-clockwise rotation, and reduce b to a. The combined action of the centrifugal position and lift always maintains the attack angle a  in the optimum range. The figure shows, the blade’s center of gravity must be located before the point where the lift applies. Otherwise the self-pitching will not work.

Thus, by properly-designing the nose CG position and the lift force bearing point on blade, one can achieve the automatic adjustment of the pitch angle and maintain it in the optimum range. The working process of a self-pitched VAWT is described as follows.  When the wind turbine is stationary, some blades will automatically adjust in parallel to wind and some perpendicular to wind; it is essentially a drag-type wind turbine. The blade parallel to wind direction bears large wind thrust and the blade perpendicular to wind direction bears small wind drag. The difference between the thrust and drag starts the wind turbine in low wind speed. At the moment of starting, the turbine blades will automatically adjust the attack angle and work under lift type mode. When the wind is relative stable, the blade pitches will be adjusted periodically during each rotation.

88,Test rig for simulating container tip over lip impact,1574260315,"I'm working on a small container (9"" tall x 5"" dia.) with a sealed lid (like a pain can). We have a requirement where the container has to tip over and remain functionally intact.

The contents is basically a metal slug (something we can not use for a physical test at the moment).

So my plan is to calculate the force of impact from a tip over, then setup a test rig with the container upright and a swinging weight to help establish a repeatable test as to whether the lid will pop off or not. (Similar to a Izod impact test rig)

For the tip over, my current thought process was to simplify the container to a lever mechanism. While at rest tipped over, I did a simple two point weight calc based on the center of gravity. For a 47.76 lb container (\~9.27"" tall), the point making impact has a weight of 23.6 lbs. From here, can I do a simple F=ma? Or is it more complicated then that?

The thought was that I could change the value for acceleration to take into account external forces that would cause the container to tip. (someone smacking it with their elbow) I'm not sure if I want to dive into determining angular acceleration based on the container at rest or not. Seems like I would just be over complicating things.

If I'm on the right track, then my plan was to use a pendulum equation to repeat that force on our test rig. That's possibly another question. I cannot seem to find a simple impact force equation that makes sense to me. I'm assuming the force I'm looking for based on a pendulum diagram is the tangent F=mgsin(theta)?

91,Why are solar panels built flat instead of hollow?,1574258132,"Hello, I was looking at some videos about solar panels \[1\]\[2\] and I wonder why these are built flat, I see there's a lot of layers used in particular there's the anti-reflection layer which prevents light from bouncing off and according to the second guy it isn't very efficient so why not create these cell as hollow tubes or sheets of solar cells and have the light bounce within it, much like a fiber-optic cable.

Something like this:

    *light*
         \
    NP|PN \NP|PN
    NP|PN /NP|PN
    NP|PN/ NP|PN
    NP|PN\ NP|PN

Being hollow means it'll increase the surface per square meter and it won't need that anti-reflection layer, it could also use a transparent liquid inside to act as coolant (because I think the heat is also a problem) and if this liquid is conductive it could act as the top contact removing another layer from the design.

So, why is this a terrible idea? :)

As any Australian users here know, the Australian government has been an incompetent disaster. One of the more overlooked aspects to this absolute clusterfuck is the lack of investment into the space sector. [Having dwindled from a space leader to also-ran in 50 years](http://theconversation.com/lost-in-space-australia-dwindled-from-space-leader-to-also-ran-in-50-years-83310), various Australian governments have failed to capitalise on the growing space sector. In addition, overly strict regulations such as, until 2018, a requirement of $750 million for insurance of a satellite [(page 6 here)](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/SpaceActivitiesBill18/~/media/Committees/economics_ctte/SpaceActivitiesBill18/report.pdf) have unnecessarily stifiled space development in Australia.

It's frankly quite embarrassing when developing countries such as [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Space_Research_and_Development_Agency) and [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aerospace_Development_Administration) have had space programs longer and more successful than Australia has.

I was hoping to get a postgraduate degree so I could get out of this backwards country and work in the US Space Industry on an EB-2 visa but my mediocre GPA, a 4.025 on a scale of 7 after 3 semesters (equal to a 2.3 on a scale of 4), prevents me from getting any postgraduate degree. I am going to probably commit suicide soon (most likely before Christmas) as without a postgraduate degree, my only options to working in the space industry as an Australian are either Rocket Lab in New Zealand or starting my own space company from scratch. I just hope my death will force the Australian government to increase funding in the Australian space industry.

In the Netherlands they give you two chances. If you fail the year they ask you to wait for 2 years before you can reapply.

I want to change careers into Software Engineering and Electronics. My greatest fear is the whole university system. My ex who studied Astronomy in the Netherlands mentioned that they had a lot of past papers and answers. In my past course, Psychology (yeah I know, bad choice in retrospect), they had little to no past papers. I was just wondering if this was the case for Engineering disciplines as well? Are there a good chunk of past papers for Engineering?

I am only asking because the next time I go to university, I want to get the highest grade possible. I know I can but if I am honest, I get lazy easily and my univeristy experience hardly motivated me. Having said that, I am highly motivated in pursuing the field of Software Engineering because I enjoy working with computers and see things actually work.

If someone could link me to an archive of past papers related to Software Engineering in the UK please. I would appreciate it a lot. 

Also, if anyone has gone through the UK degree course related to engineering, please do share your insights. I know it is stupid but when see everyone trying to outdo one another, I become unmotivated for some silly reason. I know that it will be a harder and more demanding course.

22,How to Fatigue Foam,1574213965,"Hello there!

I’ve been having difficulty figuring out how to test the fatigue life of a foam I have. I am constrained to using a cyclic flexure tester (compression and tension) that has a displacement of 0.47 inches (12 mm). Per ASTM testing protocol, it calls for us to use a 4 inch x 15 inch x 15 inch block of foam using a foam compression tester, however, I have a constraint. I am wondering whether I can scale the whole experiment down by a ratio of 10 (which would yield a block that is 0.4 inches high x 1.5 inches wide x 1.5 inches long. This will fit in the tester that I have, but I am unsure the values would scale down linearly.

I am using polyurethane foam (Technical Sheet attached) with a density of 2 pounds/ft\^3 that has an Indentation Force Deflection of 55 pounds to compress down to 25% (1 inch), and 120 pounds to compress down to 65% (2.6 inches). So, will scale everything down makes compressing the new foam test specimen down 0.1 inches be 5.5 pounds and 0.26 inches 12 pounds?

(I read somewhere that the pressure required to compress foam down is logarithmic. Furthermore, the technical sheet has a ""compression set 90%"", and ""fatigue loss percentage"". Unsure of the unit, but the company uses Foot-Pound- Second)

23,"Wanting to get some insight into design, manufacturing and production lines",1574211430,"I'm still a Mech &amp; Automotive student, and the more I've progressed through my degree, I've became a lot more interested in manufacturing and the operations of factories and production lines than I ever thought I would.

The more videos of manufacturing techniques and 'how things are made' I watch, the more all of this blows my mind. There are several avenues of discussion I want to go with this.

One thing is about any general sort of mass production machine or automation process, for example, something as simple is mass producing [nuts and bolts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxcw08p_oY).

Who are the people that design the machines which do all this automation work, for example the die machine which makes the hex bolt heads at around the 50s mark in the video. How were the operating parts of those machines designed and the velocities and displacements calculated so that process would work as fast as it can. Or how did people even work out that designing machines like that would be viable way to manufacture nuts and bolts?

I know that at a basic level, its all just gears, hydraulics, pneumatics, cams, electric motors and eccentric shafts etc, but its just the timing of all these movements and knowing that given process will give the needed output.

Or from the other side, when it comes to designing a product, how do people know that what they are making is feasible to produce?

For example, making something like a car rim or an intake manifold out of a piece of billet aluminum using a CNC machine, or an engine block/cylinder head using sand casting. For the engine block or head, with all the oil, coolant and intake and exhaust air passages needed, especially for something complex like a W16 or V12, is there any chance for someone to design a block or head in which it isn't possible to completely fill the required volume, or maybe the oil and coolant passages themselves aren't sufficient enough to facilitate fluid flow through the whole block/head?

And as for producing a part using CNC, again I'm assuming that the person who operates the machine, has to write some sort of code to tell the machine the co-ordinates of the cutting piece and the order in which to remove material and when to swap cutting piece sizes etc, so it is possible to design such a part in which it is far too complex for the CNC machine and the person writing the code to deal with?

Or even just simply designing a factory/production plant in general. How do you know how much floor space you need, what kind of automation machines you need, the layout of said machines, and the processes that need to take place at each stage and the state the part needs to be in order to move on the next manufacturing stage, how many parts can each machine work on or output at a time etc.

Like when you're designing a part, especially if its maybe for a specialized low-volume run of maybe 100 units or something as a supplier for a motorsport team for a season or for a high-end hypercar, how do you know the part you're designing can actually be manufactured at a feasible time frame and cost for that situation, like say the complex headlamp clusters you see on Audi, Mercedes and Porsche these days or you instead feel you've reached a point where you need to introduce a new manufacturing process or design a new tool, or material treatment such as having the material in powder form and sintered (like for silicon-carbide brake discs), or knowing that at this stage of the manufacturing process, quenching to this temperature and allowing to cool for x amount of time will produce this outcome which will be required for the next phase of the manufacturing process etc.

And I guess my final question is, how on earth have we been able to accurately design, manufacture and test parts like back in the '30s before CAD and access to all of this computer controlled automation? That really blows my mind. Like I assume now for casting engine blocks, people do CFD simulations to make sure the cast they've made will work, but obviously engineers in the 1930's never had that luxury.


I'm sorry for rambling in such a chaotic mess that I did, and probably didn't structure my curiosity well enough. It's just the more I think about this stuff the more overwhelmed I get about this subject and kind of take it for granted. Especially as I'm someone who at some point would love to have my own company/business of designing and manufacturing my own automotive parts for aftermarket or motorsport supplier applications. Whether it be brake calipers, rims, control arms, turbochargers/superchargers. So obviously I should make a conscious effort to learn a lot more about the design and manufacture process.

I am a senior ME student in Louisiana with a internship and co-op under my belt. The place I co-op'd at, let's call them company A, is an engineering consulting firm in BR that serves the oil &amp; gas industry. 

After my co-op, Company A, came with a strong offer at $85k/yr with decent benefits. I am not very fond of the BR area and the work was dull at times, but the offer was killer. Note that Company A is on a 4 day work week. 

Once back at college, I interviewed with several companies from the career fair and was eventually offered by an aerospace intelligence/defense contractor, let's call them company B. Company B is in a remote area but not too far from Dallas, and their description of the work duties seemed to more align with my interests. Company B offered $73k but came up to $78k with a $7k sign on bonus when told about Company A's offer. Their benefits are a little better. Company B is on a 5 day work week. 

I am conflicted on whether the $7k cut is worth what I perceive as a better and more enjoyable work environment. I know how Company A work, since I spent 6mo there, and while it wasn't my favorite, I imagine I could work there for 2-3 yrs and move on. On the other hand I could accept company B and may find that I like it and stay, or again leave after 2-3 yrs and move on.

30,Opening discussion regarding the process of External Thread Forming/Rolling,1574204581,"I am a graduate of the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign.   
I studied Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Materials Science focused in Metals.  
Currently I am in the metalworking industry dealing with Thread Rolling Tools.

These tools cold form external threads using cylindrical HSS dies that push material down into the roots of the threads while the remaining material flows up into the crest (Filling the root of the Die profile).   
They are normally loaded into milling machines or fixed to a lathe turret and can create profiles from #0-80 up to 9IN diameters.  
I have been breaking my head over ways to model the process of thread formation using these die heads, but I am not sure what I am looking for. 

Axial Thrust required to begin the process would be nice to know.

The radial forces exerted on the die profile would also be informative.

Where does compressive strength, yield strength, poisson's ration, elastic modulus, and strain hardening effects come into play here?

How these parameters affect the power and torque required to generate a specific length, pitch and diameter thread?

I am looking at a potential house that will be a slow flipper with the idea to live in it for a few years. Upon looking at the house, I noticed the back of the garage has a crack and some slight bowing. This is a raised ranch.

I am living in Kansas, which seems to have a high clay content in their dirt. Coming from Chicago, I am not used to this so that is why I am asking.

[These are the exact dimensions of the house, with the 2 walls in question highlighted in red for severe and yellow for mild](https://i.gyazo.com/d851109ec5ff0eb8fb94bcc3d3a15124.png)

The back of the garage wall has the bowing, but the rest of that northern wall does not, possibly due due to the switch in direction and back for the foundation but I assume are just as susceptible to this cracking in the future. The west side of the garage has some slight cracking but no bowing, yet. 

My question is, would it be better to replace the section of foundation in the back/north side of the garage and I-beam the left side? I-Beam all of it? Is there something I can install to reduce the pressure to the outside of the foundation that isn't going to require complete tear up of the basement? Anything external like digging up and redoing the dirt + compression of it outside those walls? Possible waterproofing?

I've been struggling a lot lately about deciding between jobs. I am stifled by indecision.  I just graduated top of my class in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech. I want to work with people and not necessarily be a super technical guy. I want to be the guy who understands the technical subject-matter and can be the liaison between the two teams or for the customer.  I am a very motivated and hard-working person. I'm 27 years old so I already feel a little behind for starting my career and I really want to make the best decision. 

Let's consider that the compensations are generally the same. 

**Job 1) Capital One Business Analyst**

This is a well-known program (Analyst Development Program) where you receive training for the two years you are in it and are an incremental part of the business. I would use tools like tableau, python, SQL, and ppt to analyze and present business decisions for a particular product or line of business based on data. It's like internal consulting. Job promotions are given every 1-2 years and its normal to become a director within 7-10 years. People regularly leave from Capital One to go to companies like Google, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, and Mckinsey. 

I would be in a cohort of almost 200 people

This seems like the most marketable choice

**Job 2) Crown Castle - Emerging Leaders Program**

A blurb about them from wiki:  *At Crown Castle, we work around the country to build and maintain the infrastructure behind the world’s most revolutionary technologies. Our portfolio of communications infrastructure (towers, small cells, fiber) connects cities and communities to essential data, technology, and wireless service—bringing information, ideas and innovations to the people and businesses that need them. As the nation’s largest provider of communications infrastructure and with more than 5,000 employees across the country, we’ve been building the connections that people depend on for 25 years. Crown Castle is an S&amp;P 500 company and one of the largest Real Estate Investment Trusts in the United States with an enterprise value of approximately $70 billion.* 

Basically, they lease property on their towers, fiber, and 5G infrastructure to the big telecom companies. This is the shared infrastructure model. 5G is expected to boom in the next 5 or 10 years and this company is situated to benefit greatly.

The role : 4 rotations in different cities over 2 years. The roles involve corporate finance, real estate management, radio frequency engineering, and assistant project management. This program was developed 3 years ago to groom people for leadership at Crown Castle. One thing they kept telling us is that 70% of leadership is up for retirement in the next 10 years and they want the people in this program to lead the company. Participants are given mentorship and brought into executive and leadership meetings to observe and give input.  So 70% of the time is spent on the actual role while 30% of the time is spent in development opportunities that a normal entry person or even someone there for 5 years would never get to see or be a part of. They only hire about 6 or 7 people each year for this.

After the 2 years, participants are put into the role of their choice, generally as a project manager. 

I see great long term potential with this company but I worry that if I don't like it that I won't be as marketable, since its not a big name and I don't know how marketable the skills are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both companies have great work-life balance but Crown Castle is slightly better and even pays overtime.

For the past year I have been in the office doing pre construction work, and I'm realizing the construction lifestyle isn't for me. I've realized that the constant moving, long hours, and high stress is not worth the upward mobility and additional pay I will receive over the lifecycle of my career. Coming out of college I wanted to pursue a job that allowed me to move around, but over the past year I've had a change in values and have started to place a lot more value on family and thereby stability.

There is no **one** thing that I'd say I'm passionate about, that's the problem.

6,"Does anyone have career advice for a dissatisfied first yearer working in Aerospace &amp; Defense? I'm totally lost. Bullet points include ""I miss using science, I hate my job, I'd like to do something that matters, I'd like to combine a career in engineering and international relations"".",1574100102,"This is my first time posting here. It's long, and there may be some redundancy, but this is a lot of stuff I've been mulling over in my mind for a while, and I just recently took the courage to type it up (last month) and today, to finally post it. 

I have a B.S in materials engineering. I have been working my first professional gig at a top defense company for the past 8 months. I chose the degree I have because of its multidisciplinary nature. I thought that, after graduating and starting my career, things would be a little clearer. I had a general idea of what I wanted to do with my life (NASA! or “saving the environment”), but now I feel more lost than ever. I had thought that I would be exposed to lots of different things while on the job and that the path forward would be clear, but I haven’t been exposed to anything new or interesting, not really.  I am profoundly dissatisfied with work, with my life and with the path I’ve chosen. I need advice in two regards, firstly, with how much I hate the job I have (and am I being crazy or entitled?), and secondly, with whether I can/should use engineering as a background to shift my career away from, well, engineering.

**Complaints with my job (feel free to skip):**

1. I am not in a position to network. I work directly with two people, and the both of them are close to retirement. Everyone working at my location (50 or so engineers, plus technicians, management, etc.) is above the age of 55 and have been in the same positions since forever. The only people who seem to network with outside facilities and engineers in different departments are in management; any collaboration is dictated and at most, these outside engineers are an email footnote. I feel as if I am missing out on a lot of new skills, connections and therefore, opportunities. I am good with people, I waited tables and bartended for nearly 10 years- my personality is one of my greatest assets, I am confident and well spoken, intelligent and well rounded, but I have no use for these traits in my current position. I’m constantly being told that to put *less* thought/questioning into the work we do, to make the reports less detail oriented- essentially to never go above and beyond.  
 

2. I am underutilized. The work itself is almost always the exact same process- preparing samples, microscopy, chemical and mechanical testing. There is no creativity in what I do, I’m just following a process that has minimal if any variation between projects.  Any improvements to any processes are shot down, (I wasn’t hired to make process improvements, but shouldn’t that be a part of literally every engineering job- making things more efficient?). As an example, I asked for access to some software so that I could write a simple program to streamline one of the processes. It was a hard no, “we don’t need that”. I have a lot more to give than what they’re asking for, and so far it feels like any attempt at making myself more valuable has been shot down- taking initiative doesn’t result in any reward.  
 

I am constantly bored, constantly trying to come up with new things to do, constantly trying to butt my way into what other people are doing, but everyone here values their independence (something I was told was rare in the engineering world). I spend a lot of time reading up on the latest technology and trying to come up with new applications for the stuff I already know. I’ve read through all of the old reports and I skim through the books we have here pretty often. But why bother? *Fresh eyes are not wanted or appreciated*. Why aren’t I being given more to do? Why hasn’t anyone taken me under their wing? Why isn’t problem solving a part of my day-to-day? Why did I even go to school if they didn’t want thinkers? It feels like my role is to be a cog, and nothing more.  

3. I am underpaid.  I make $50k a year, before taxes ($39k after) I am making less money than literally all of my friends, the majority of which do not hold a degree. This was fine, at first, because it was heavily implied that after 6 months of contract labor employment, I would get a position with the company where I can negotiate benefits, vacation and a salary. Turns out the agreement I signed said “6+ months”; 7 months in, I asked to set up a meeting to discuss “my future at the company and any notes on performance and expectations”. My manager said he would speak to me “next week”, but it’s been two weeks (he has been busy, end of the year stuff). It’s fine, for the very near future, but I still live with my parents (fucking kill me please)- I want to move out, I want to start a life- we live in one of the 100 most expensive counties in the country, I thought I would be able to pay off my debts and bills, and afford rent, and also save a small percentage of my income, but that isn’t a reality for me at the moment. I have no benefits. I have no savings and I have a lot of debts. I feel terrible about it all, all the time. I'm trying to get a second job waiting tables. Many of my coworkers refuse to actually retire, they're gaming the system and pulling in from 2 or 3 sources of income. I can't compete with the 72 year old who *technically* retired so he can collect his pension and his social security, but is still getting an hourly salary 10x higher than mine, despite being out for months with health issues and ""working from home"" (i.e, just dictating to me via email what I will be doing, without ever needing or wanting my input- you know, me, here, with the test piece, in my hand, whose questions and concerns are handwaved away in much the same way I would do to a child, no matter the legitimacy). 

**Concerns with my career path**

1. What I’m doing now does not reflect my passion or my interests. Materials science is super cool, but is this it for me? Evaluating metals? Did I go to school thinking that the reward would be “doing science as an engineer”, only to find myself pressing buttons on machines and typing up reports? There is no creativity. There is no brain power necessary. No room for innovating. This is not my passion.  I don’t know if my experience here has toxified my perspective or maybe I just had unreal expectations? I thought that this job had been a really lucky break (Fortune 200 Company, that’s the dream for an engineer right out of college, right?). A major interest was space stuff when I opted for materials engineering- satellites, telescopes, rovers, ISS stuff etc- ultimately, my goal was to work in the private industry for a few years before trying to move to NASA (“oh, to serve the people at the most incredible organization on earth!”). I had figured that there would be room to work on some of the innovative tech I read about in my subscriptions to ASM, M&amp;P, etc... maybe not at first, but eventually. Now that I’ve been working here and speaking to people, it seems like you need some sort of celebrity status to work on anything that’s actually interesting or important. I had thought that all that is needed is to prove yourself, take initiative, show that you can think outside of the box and are an overall asset to whatever organization you’re with, and you’re in. That seems like a pipe dream now.

2. I don’t know if I want to be an engineer for much longer. Don’t get me wrong, I haven’t lost interest in the thing I studied… but I don’t know, I guess I was more interested in the actual material and knowledge I was gaining than in the planning and execution of finding a career that made me happy. To me it made total sense, if youre a self-described problem solver, who likes science, who grew up on legos and 3D puzzles, whose good at math, who can explain complex ideas in simple terms, than this should be the obvious career choice, right? I mean, I built the only working stirling engine in class that one time, and I loved it! The outcome of my senior design project was particularly impressive, “expectations exceeded well beyond the standards set” (to partially quote the company contact) (obviously it was a team effort)- and I felt like it was a sign that THIS was right, THIS is the adult I’m becoming, THIS is what I am made to do, THIS is my calling. I guess not, because I find myself rethinking everything this past year, with this voice in my head that tells me I’ve made a terrible mistake and squandered any opportunity to do what I really want to do- to make a positive change, to help people, to leave the world better, more capable, than how I found it. I thought that this would be through engineering, maybe at NASA, maybe through environmentally sustainable innovations, maybe maybe. 

3. I’ve started thinking more about an out than a way up. I could spend my life trying to end up on mission control, or something like that, but is that really the best thing for me? I want to be involved with problem solving on a larger scale, in terms of international relations, policy, diplomacy, etc. I know that this is completely different than what I studied, but I’d like to figure out how to apply engineering with this sort of path. Considering the future we’ve set up for ourselves, there is so much that needs to be done and I want to be a part of that. I thought that I could do this through engineering, but I don’t know, my experience thus far as an “engineer” has completely taken the wind out of my sails.

I’m fairly well travelled, I’m fluent in two languages, and conversational in two others. I’m knowledgeable about world history, general international relations, the different countries, their main exports/imports, geopolitical relationships, systems of government, leaders of governments, etc. (I have so much more to learn). I take great pleasure in learning about this stuff. I love details. As far as it relates to engineering, I give a lot of thought to materials, extraction of ores, international trade, manufacturing, etc. The whole web of connections that keeps our world going fascinates me. 

I’ve been trying to think about how I can combine my love of science, my experience in engineering and my interest in international relations. I have volunteered in political campaigns as well as worked some paid gigs for local candidates. I’m good at this. As I said above, I’m really good with people. I want to travel, I want to leverage my personality and my ability to connect with others to get a seat at the table when important decisions are being made. Hell, I don’t even need a seat at the table, but I’d like to be part of the team advising someone who has one. I want to learn more about the world, about history, governments, language. I want to do research, to innovate, to teach, to maybe one day help craft policy. I want to be involved in engineering, geopolitics, strategy, logistics and tech. I want to look back at my life’s work when and see accomplishments that mattered- being a rich engineer isn’t my goal, being a comfortable and proud engineer, who left the world a little brighter, is. Can that be done through the sort of work I’ve tried to define above? Can I even get close? I’ve looked into engineering work for the UN, and for science ambassador programs, but the options seem pretty limited. I’m seriously weighing the possibility of going to get a masters in international relations and business, and using that with my engineering degree to secure me a comfortable and fulfilling position, but I just don’t know. I don’t know what I’d do, or how I’d do it, I just know the general direction I’d like to go in.

Should I abandon engineering and start over? I don’t think I want to do that, I don’t think I want to leave the field of engineering, but I also don’t know if I want to be *just* that. Some engineers become patent lawyers, what can I become that fits with my passions? I’m just sick of thinking that I was happier as a bartender, because while I was, I had always reminded myself that one day, ""I’d be somebody doing something important, when all this hard work pays off."" That was the thought that kept me sane. I can't exactly turn back now. 

**Side notes**

1. I am a prideful, yet reserved straight-passing gay man (it makes life profoundly easier when you can be a part of the “good old boys” conversations without having to answer intrusive questions). I am lucky that my personal life is my own and that I can get away with keeping it that way. I only mention this because I do not plan to have a wife or kids, giving me somewhat of an advantage in the ability to focus on my career without the typical, major distractions. Romantically, I would like to meet someone who is similarly ambitious, but that’s not really important, I’m not focused on this. I want to throw myself into work.

2. I want my integrity, my convictions, my passions and my interests to matter in what I do. I don’t want to harm, I want to create. I don’t want to be greedy, I want to be altruistic.

12,Looking for a light and water resistant insulation for industrial use,1574088168,"Hello all,

I currently work in the fishmeal industry in Peru. Part of the drying process of the fishmeal is the use of a RotaTube Dryer that has a steam jacket at 160°C. Imagine a cylinder with 3m in diameter and 20 m long that rotates at 6 rpm. 

Of course this must be insulated to prevent excessive heat losses. Nowadays mineral wool is used for this purpose followed by a steel jacket.

The problem is we are a 100 meters away from the ocean and the ambient is very moist. Also, often there are spillages of fishmeal and a power-washer is used to clean the RotaTube Dryer. This two factors destroy the insulating capacity of the mineral wool. At the end of two years of use (the time period in which normally the insulation is changed) the mineral wool is smashed to a third of the original thickness and really moist. 

I'm looking for a insulation capable of resisting a power washer and not accumulate moisture that also is mechanically sturdy enough so the thickness remains constant. 

Also, corrosion under the insulation is a problem for us.

To be honest, I dont feel fulfilled at work-- I feel like my education is lacking and I wish I understood the underlying mathematics/algorithms behind the tools and softwares we use (I do thermal analysis). Would an M.S. fix this? Or will this come with more years of work experience? Only been here 1.5 years. 

I want to be a technical expert one day... a guy that people rely on for all things thermal. I just dont see it happening with just a B.S. Am I wrong? 

Lastly, is not having an M.S. a hard ""no"" for some entities, like government/NASA? Or is it simply a leg-up if it's neck and neck with another candidate?

Noticing how much heating power is in sunlight inspired an idea for a water-solar power generator that employs a heat-exchanger to bring water to the boiling point.

[This diagram](https://imgur.com/DjCIGFL) illustrates the idea along with the following:

1. The black box is a wide shallow plastic container that absorbs solar heat.  I imagine this heating up to, say, 70°C.
2. The blue box is a pressurized container in which water is boiled.
3. The Red-blue box is a fluid heat-exchanger (similar to that found in an air-conditioner) which aims to raise the temperature from \~70°C to 100+°C in the boiler.
4. The steam from the boiler turns a turbine, which generates electricity.
5. This electricity would drive the heat-exchanger and the pump.

I’m graduating university next year and I really don’t see myself doing anything heavily mechanical engineering related. Mechanics and manufacturing topics bore the hell out of me. I feel like electrical engineering would have been the better choice to get into software engineering, however due to the difference in modules studied in first year between the courses, it wasn’t an option to change in second year. I do a lot of robotics work too which is somewhat software engineering based which might help.

I love all of my modules which have an element of programming and coding in them, however they are pretty limited, (have only really coded in C/C++) I feel like I would’ve been better suited to a CompSci degree at this point, but seeing as I am actually doing pretty well so far I don’t want to restart my degree. Due to funding issues I don’t think a masters would be viable either.

Can anybody suggest what I can do to get hired by a Software engineering company or suggest Mechanical Engineering jobs which are programming based? Is there anything useful to learn in my own time and what would make me stand out from CS graduates?

48,Fabric Tension Buildings - Retrofit to Fix Cover Problems,1574027135,"I purchased a 72'W x 300'L X 30'H fabric tension building.  My building has 12' vertical sides with a barrel shaped top. The trusses are 20' OC and are anchored by concrete piers (installed separately from the manufacturer based off the building's plans). The fabric covers are in 100' x approximate 120' long (to enclose the sides and top of the building).

The actual frame is sturdy, but I suspect that the building's shape is a large contributing factor to the problem's I'm having with the fabric cover. The 100' width of the cover and the inadequate size of the tension poles that stretch and anchor the cover at the base of the trusses are the other 2 factors.  Long story short, 2 1/2 years after installation, the manufacturer had to replace all 3 covers. 4 1/2 years later, another 2 sections were destroyed  in 2 separate weather events 7 months apart. Manufacturer said these covers typically last 20+ years but warrantied for 15.

There has been some dispute between myself and the manufacturer, but the manufacturer has agreed to retrofit their newer system to my building. Essentially, they will be attaching rails to each truss that you feed the cover into as you pull it over, and that stretches the fabric laterally. This means that the cover will be in 15, 20'w sections, instead of 3 large sections. They will also beef up the tension poles that stretch the fabric vertically on each side. 

The current design has 2 trusses with the rails that stretch the end covers from the middle of the building, and only the center section is stretched between the rails. The very ends of the building use PVC (the other design deficiency I forgot to mention above) to stretch the fabric over the end trusses. That means the intermediate trusses are simply there to HOLD THE FABRIC UP, while essentially 4 out of the 16 trusses HOLD THE FABRIC DOWN.

Their new design already SEEMS to be a huge improvement. If there is a tear than can't be patched, it's much cheaper to replace. However, I don't trust the manufacturer anymore. I don't trust that they aren't just slapping a bandaid on their mistake and I will continue to have issues. I'm not an engineer, but I weld and have built a few metal buildings for myself so I'm not completely clueless but let me ask this:

**QUESTION 1:**  All the trusses are essentially the same except for the 2 that have the rails added.  The end sections have lateral brace supports. There are cable 'sway' braces along  the whole length of the building in conjunction with the purlins. There are also several cross cable bracing assemblies between the trusses that support the 4 lateral stretch points. \*\*\*I'll attach a really bad, not to scale quick sketch to give you a general idea\*\*\* Again, the frame is adequate to support itself alone, BUT they haven't mentioned anything about changing the location of the cable braces. Since we are adapting the trusses to support the smaller covers, each truss will now share the responsibility to stretch the cover laterally in both directions (except the 2 on the very ends.) . I'm assuming the foundation was designed appropriately to support the building, but I'm concerned if the smaller covers will be able to withstand normal ground movements and not tear or pop out. The new sections will weigh about 200lb, so freight isn't cheap, the lift rental even for one day can run up to $400... and they haven't answered me yet about the cost per section.... so NOT cheap but not enough for insurance to cover it (if I'll even be able to insure my building at all). Given the little amount of information, do you think this will fix my cover issues to last the way it was intended?

**QUESTION 2**: About how much would it cost me to get an independent engineering review done on a project like this?

For my final project in FEA my partner and I are attempting to create a simulation of a hockey slap shot. The FEA class that I'm in is only a 1 credit hour class, and we covered no dynamics. Here is a breakdown of what I need to happen:

1. The stick is in the windup and the blade makes contact with the ice about a foot before making contact with the puck
2. During this 1 foot span the stick flexes so the stick is already bent when it makes contact with the puck.
3. The player follows through the puck, and the stick straightens out (acting like a spring) and propels the puck forward even more.

Currently we're trying to break down the slap shot into separate stages. Here is my current thought process, use static structural to create the prestress in the stick, use explicit dynamics to have the blade have its initial contact with the puck. However, I have absolutely no idea how to simulate the follow through of the puck, as well as the stick bending back to its inital position (where it acts like a spring). If anyone could enlighten me, that would be greatly appreciated.

For an experiment I have a luer lock syringe which is feeding an ink-jet drop on demand dispenser.  The production of drops is sensitive to the positive pressure from the syringe and currently I am fine tuning things by watching the drop form at the end of the ink-jet nozzle.  I think I am applying a few milliATM \~ less than a kiloPascal.

I would like to measure with more accuracy the amount of pressure when the device is successfully firing. Ultimately with some stepper motors maybe setting up a PID like feed back to keep the device functioning.

Can anyone recommend a manufacturer or have any experience making such readers?  Can I find something which is a flow through pressure reader or do they come in T shape?  

I would like the measurement to have an option to connect to an arduino or similar micro-controller.  

I am not familiar with this sort of product or sphere but I image worst case I can make a custom thing like:

Backstory: I work in a fire sprinkler company as a designer (my title is ""engineer"" and I do have a BA in mechanical engineering).  My job requires me to plan out the sprinkler heads and pipes and make materials list for installation.

Recently, I have a project where I have to update the sprinkler system in an older building with a pre existing system that only covered half the building (since the other half was built when buildings weren't required to have them).  For those who don't know, sprinklers rely on the water from the street mains to give enough pressure to power them.  Recently, it was discovered that the water pressure in the street nearby was weaker than believed to be, which means the design I made might not work because the pressure is lower than assumed.  I was told by my boss to not run calculations to check if the design will work, since it's not required by the code if there was an existing.  My boss doesn't want me to do it because it takes more time (and money) to do this process.

Besides covering my ass, which I already plan to do, what should I do?  It feels unethical to have a design that might fail (doubtful, in my boss's words) because we didn't run the calcs.",AskEngineers,False,aapshaw,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dwxmk5/how_should_i_approach_an_ethical_dilemma/

I wasn’t great at math as a teenager but that’s because I didn’t care....

Now I care....almost dying does that to you.

I easily obtained a master mechanic certification. it was just a lot of tests honestly, where you only had to schore above a 65%.

The field wasn’t for me because I saw a lot of employees hating their lives and job.

Also I can’t expect a customer to put money in my wallet because they can find it cheaper down the road

I want to make myself viable to the world in some sort of measurable way.

I will put in the hours and years to become familiar with complex information

43,"Could cold be efficiently delivered as an urban utility, similarly to heat?",1573829978,"G'day everyone! I've never tried the reddit thing before, but a most compelling idle question just popped into my mind, and this seemed like a good place to try and find an informed answer.

As a premise, consider the idea of climate-control heating as an urban utility; in some communities (for example, Brisbane Aus) heat is not delivered directly, but is provided via electricity or natural gas, whereas in other communities (eg, Randers Dk) heat is delivered centrally from a city-scale furnace system, via the medium of steam/hot water in an insulated pipe network.

This got me thinking; could cold, i.e. refrigeration, be feasibly delivered centrally, in a similar way to Randers' heat pipes? Say a densely-populated, hot-climate urban community were to build enormous, city-sized refrigeration plants, and distribute, say, liquid nitrogen, as a civic utility to enable air-conditioning and refrigeration. Would that kind of scheme be at all energy efficient? Or is electricity generally a better, more efficient way to do it?

Bonus question; in usually-humid climates (eg Singapore), could the condensation water generated by these hypothetical city-sized refrigeration plants be collected, and contribute to the drinking water supply? Could this be done, or am I just an idiot who don't know a damn thing about thermodynamics?

63,Going from manufacturing to research (design engineer),1573788489,"So I've been in my first ever eng job for a little under a year, but I sense that my time there may soon end (perhaps not voluntarily \*gulp\*). It's design engineering at a small manufacturing company, which, as an aerospace grad, I'd never thought I'd enjoy. Since the place is so small, each of the small number of eng are given entire orders to themselves, fully designing them and following them through the factory until they are a finished product before our eyes. It's actually very gratifying.

However, I may soon have to leave, and I've had a hell of a time figuring out what I want to do next. I'd love to actually be in aerospace, but I worry that door may have closed with my failure to start out in the field after graduating, plus in my experience it's competitive and the large environments don't lend themselves to individually interesting jobs. Ditto automotive (anyone who can chime in on that?). I may have a couple opportunities in research lab environments, but that just seems so much like the opposite of what I do now, like it would lack all of what makes me interested in my current job.

I'm trying to figure out what the heat deflection (or deformation) temperatures are of certain copolymers, specifically Dupont's Hytrel. I see the HDT of Hytrel is -17C, but can't figure out if it will stand up to certain temperatures without premaritally changing shape. 

From what I understand the HDT is when the ""plastic"" starts to deform, but since Hytrel is a flexible material to begin with, the HDT I suppose is low because it will not deform below the 17C, whereas at ambient temps it will always ""deform"" albeit remember it's original shape. 

The info I'm trying to find is, what is the temperature that an elastomer will no longer ""remember"" it's shape once heated.

To give more info on why I'm asking, I 3D printed a structure from PVDF (or Kynar) that will be used with an atmospheric pressure of steam and need to plug some of the holes. I'm hoping to design the plugs from Hytrel but want to make sure they will stand up to the temperatures of steam. Hytrel has a melting point of 165C, but I don't know at what temperatures the Hytrel will loose its mechanical strength.

Will it be able to handle the heat and retain it's shape right up until 165C? Or is there a HDT for flexible materials where the mechanical properties break down unlike a rigid plastic?

79,A better way to help fellow employees do heat set inserts in plastic parts,1573770261,"Essentially I'm relatively new to this current job; I want to make a good impression as it's a smaller company and I deal with people like the ceo on a daily basis. 

I currently work in QC/QA for a company that does plastic injection molding and in most of our parts we heat set brass or aluminum inserts into holes on the parts. 

Currently there are a few (4ish) employees who just can not get this right. We end up having to spend hours and hours a day checking every insert they do because a lot of time they leave them too high (most often) or too low (least often) and sometimes install them crooked into the boss of the plastic piece and it's slowing down production like crazy. 

I'm currently trying to find a better way to either 

1) Get inserts much better, enough so that we don't need to always check all of their work for things to send back to them to re-work

or 

2) Find a better way to very quickly QC their inserts to tell if they are high/low/crooked. 

I'm new to the field, *and working in general* so any info or advice you can give me with working with plastics/heat inserts would be insanely appreciated. 

We are going to try something like this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbsD-3_AP_0 to maybe get rid of the issue of inserts being so crooked, but this won't really help with the depth of the insert as we do so many different parts that need to be different depths that we can't really just put a depth stop on it and call it a day.",AskEngineers,False,VPinecone,/r/AskEngineers/comments/dwgz1r/a_better_way_to_help_fellow_employees_do_heat_set/

I'm  building a solar EV as a college project. One of the features I have  been scratching my head with is automation. Specifically running the  vehicle autonomously. I have figured out the throttle and brakes but I  am facing an issue with steering. I am using a rack and pinion system  with a worm gear attachment. With the worm gear I plan to have a motor  connected which would steer the vehicle. The problem is selection of the  motor. After reduction I need a motor which delivers at-least 2.5Nm  continuous torque. I initially planned to have a servo connected to it  but servo motors at 12VDC or 24VDC either do not have the required  torque or come with an AC controller. Even if I do get a 12VDC/24VDC  servo with 12VDC/24VDC controller then the input to the controller needs  to be external and not a button system since then it would be difficult  to feed values autonomously.

If someone has any idea how to proceed with the remote steering of a vehicle, please help me out.

91,"Sagging Floors. Structural Floor Integrity, Weight Bearing",1573758373,"**TLDR**:  g/f living in a apt w/ sagging floors in 100 yr building wants to add a 900 lbs. industrial L Shape desk to living room floor.  I'm concerned.  

**Long Version**:

My g/f has been living in a \~100 year old building for about 3 years.  She is on the top (3rd) floor.

The floor is sagging.  In the living room, I measured with a taut string from one end of the wall to about 10' in and I then checked with a leveler to make sure the string was level.  I found the distance between the taunt string and the floor to be about 1.8"" to 1.9"".  That is in a living room that is 16' by 16'.  The actual center of the apartment, the living room sort of bleeds into the Kitchen, so that is at the low point of the sag.  Therefore I get something like 10 degree theta on an inverse tan calculation (it was actually done to 11' length).

&amp;#x200B;

Also there are some noticeable cracks that run the length of one wall.  Here:

Crack runs middle of the wall, 50% of the height of the wall.

Ceiling corner near that mid wall crack above.  Mid-wall crack in prior photo can be seen in lower right corner.

  
And then several cracks that run along structural points on the opposite facing wall/entryway to the kitchen.  Here:

These three photos are the same 1 long crack

The living room opens up into the kitchen (seen in last photo above).  This area is opposite the first photo wall here.

The opening area into the kitchen can be seen here on the 'opposite' wall structure and you can see further cracks.

Yet, many of my colleagues see him as lazy. This is because he can have some downtime between running experiments where he will do something work-related, but not necessarily the top-priority thing. I am the one who advised this. Mainly because he won't have enough down time between the tests being run and switching gears to do anything significant. So, I advised he do smaller, more manageable tasks that can be completed. This is to keep him from excessive starting and stopping of tasks without really getting a lot done. 

So we have our weekly meetings and he is somewhat singled out because he is still working on R&amp;D tasks that others believe should be done by now.

Help me calculate some deflection and fatigue in structural steel tubing.,1573740212,"Just to clarify here, I know teeeechnically this is something I should have a structural or mechanical engineer sign off on, but as it's only going to be used by myself personally in a recreational space I'm not really super concerned with liability. And let's be real here guys, people out there make custom forklift and heavy equipment attachments for specialized use without a care in the world. Until someone gets hurt, but this is just me here so I'm not really worried.

&amp;#x200B;

 So basically, my shop has a 10,000lb rated car lift, and I am looking to build a sort of crane attachment that I can use to lift things into truck beds, mainly things like 55gal oil drums, excavator buckets (2,400lb and under), welders (1,200lb and under), milling machines (1,600lb and under) flatbeds (1,000lb and under), and tool boxes. I NEVER expect to lift more than 5,000lb with this thing, that being said since the lift is designed to lift 10,000lbs I would like my assembly to at the least be able to lift that much as a bit of a safety factor. I also need to calculate in fatigue as this crane is going to be seeing load, and then no load. Please understand I am doing this mainly as a hobbiest, my background is machining, welding, CAD, and commercial construction. Not engineering :P  


So  


Top Beam:  
The top ""Beam"" of the ""crane"" assembly is going to be (as far as I have planned) 3""x 3""x 3/8"" square tubing, 112.5"" long with 45 degree miter cuts on each end, to allow more linear length of weld for the supporting beams  


Supporting Beams:  
The beams supporting each end of the Top Beam are the same 3""x 3""x 3/8"" Tubing 46.59375"" long, again with 45 degree miter cuts where the Top Beam will be welded to them  


45 Degree Braces:  
I also planned in two 45 degree braces to add some support to the center of the Top Beam, as that is where the load will be applied. These are 34.171"" long tip to tip (they are 45 degree mitered on each end)  


Basically I've crunched numbers with some equations I found online for applying load to the center of a hollow square tube, which comes out as follows:  


For Calculating the Moment Of Inertia  
(Height\^3 x Width)-(Inside Height\^3 x Inside Width)/12  
So  
(3\^3 x 3)-(2.25\^3 x 2.25)/12  
(81)-(25.62890625)/12  
MoI = 78.8642578125  


Then for Calculating Deflection, Assuming the Modulus of Elasticity is 29,000,000 for Steel  
(Length\^3 x Force Applied/(3 x MoE x MoI))  
So  
(112.5\^3 x 10,000lb/(3 x 29,000,000 x 78.8642578125))  
(112.5\^3 x 10,000lb/(6861190429.69))  
(14238281250/(6861190429.69))  
Deflection = 2.07519109051""  


Obviously this is an UNACCEPTABLE level of deflection in my Top Beam, but I know that if I was figuring in for the 45 degree braces I'd probably be somewhere in the ballpark of where I want to be. I did do some calculations for deflection using 88.328125"" as the Top Beam length (which came out to a deflection of 1.00437885556"", about half of what I got with the full length), basically I figured that if I treated the math as if the Top Beam's endpoints were in the center of the space where the 45 degree braces intersect the Top Beam it would get me close to the actual deflection/strength but I know that that's certainly not an accurate way to do that. The other thing is if I do the math treating where the 45 degree braces intersect the Top Beam as the end points of the Top Beam, and plug in a 1500lb load I get a deflection of 48 thousandths, and I have a really hard time believing that a 58.5"" long section of 3""x 3""x 3/8"" tubing would deflect almost 1/16th of an inch with only 1500lb load on it. If someone could walk me through figuring out how much weight this design can actually take that would be amazing!  


I do have an Autodesk Fusion360 model of my assembly, and I would just run a Simulation or a Generative Design but how to use those features is going to be a biiiit of a learning curve for me so help from someone with more experience would be a HUGE help.

I’m interested in both mechanical design and thermodynamics, and ideally would like to become highly skilled in both by the end of my career. Almost all of my co-op experience has been design/drafting work in Solidworks, with significant exposure to finite element methods using ANSYS. I very much enjoyed the work, and got a lot of personal satisfaction from reaching the end result and sending drawings for final approval before manufacturing. However, I’m also fascinated by the manipulation of heat and energy to harness mechanical work, especially in the fact that systems and processes can be optimized for maximum thermal efficiency, and losses to entropy generation quantified.  While my co-ops did not allow for much experience in the subject, all of my thermo classes in university fascinated me. I also have the opportunity to pursue research in carbon-capture technology at my university, which sounds exciting to me due to its current infancy as a technology.

What I’m struggling with is which field to choose for studying as part of my Master’s - I feel as though studying/doing research with a focus on thermodynamics might pigeon-hole me, in the sense that I’d become isolated from future design work.

doing a simple FEA and have some questions about the results.
https://imgur.com/a/kKJhRXY

Force applied in the X direction (to the right), and a frictionless boundary condition was independently applied to the X/Y planar surfaces

Regarding the hole in the bottom left, the deformation is maximal on the 'right side', but the stress is greatest on the 'top side', with basically 0 deformation. Why is this? Is this merely an artifact of the boundary conditions, (Y planar surface only allowed to displace in the Y/Z directions)? Or is this accurate to real life? My intuition says that the 'top side' should be deforming more than it is, perhaps more than the 'right side', somewhat corresponding to the stress.

I currently work as a software engineer developing systems for autonomous vehicles (&lt;2 months, first job out of school). Autonomous Vehicles were basically my top pick for industries to get into. Most job postings listed having an M.S/PhD as a requirement, but I still managed to get my foot in the door.

However, Ive noticed that most senior level positions within this industry (senior engineer, manager, senior director,...) all REQUIRE higher levels of education and i'm worried that my BASc alone won't cut it down the line. My thought process is that I have two options.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option A:**  Take two years off to get an M.S

Pros:

* Undoubtedly fulfill the degree requirements for the more senior positions
* Have expert level knowledge in a particular niche (which makes me more valuable..?)
* Potentially publishing a paper (again, which me more valuable..?)

Cons:

* Opportunity cost - giving up two years worth of salary 
* Giving up two years worth of industry experience

&amp;#x200B;

**Option B:** Take a online MEng program while working

Pros:

* Have some form of higher education 
* Convenient - Dont have to stop working/making money
*  Employer will reimburse a portion of the tuition cost 

Cons:

* Less respected
   * MEng is less respected (from my understanding)
   * Online programs generally sound less impressive regardless of their actually rigour
* Will have to go to a lesser know state school (not many prestigious universities offer affordable online masters degrees)

For those interested in giving feedback, the podcast can be found at: [http://www.buzzsprout.com/603703](http://www.buzzsprout.com/603703) it's also on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/7xfP4HQYDGYlW9CJx95gtm), [iHeartRadio](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/269-the-gsc-podcast-50845166/) , [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/brandon-donnelly/the-gsc-podcast) ,and [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-gsc-podcast/id1481896390?uo=4) 

Compared to sales, marketing, leadership, etc, there is a significant lack of podcasts that help engineers untangle issues of where their field is heading. I'd like to make this one great, though I prefer writing engineering ""stories"", rather than technical lectures. I'd like to hear thoughts on that as well.

The diameter output will be the average.

58,Getting out of engineering? Soul searching and insight for the future.,1573618780,"TLDR at bottom

4 years ago I graduated with an Electrical Engineering degree with a specialization in controls. I have been fortunate to work with: an international OE supplier for auto suspension, the government developing and launching a satellite to space, the power industry doing distribution work, and now working for a Fortune 100 company doing automation. 

If it sounds like I've job hopped a lot, I think the same thing. The auto group was a 2 year, near full time internship that had no positions upon graduation. The government position was a contract that lasted a year before having to find more work. The power industry was not for me since it was a lot of ""look at cable A, replace with cable B."" After a year of that and bad management, I applied for my current role. 

My current role is extremely demanding on a physical, and emotional level. On average I work 70-80 hour weeks, thousands of miles away from home usually within the United States. Some of our projects are international but I haven't been assigned to those yet. To put it in perspective, I made my salary about 7 months into the job. I have been here nearly a year, I've already started gaining reputation and have been placed under a project lead with expidited goals of me leading a project lead soon. But being gone from friends and family and constantly having to miss birthday parties, festivals, etc for work has been draining.

Because of all this, I have been left unhappy. I went from aspirations of being a doctor, to being an engineer after watching Iron Man in 2008. And also my father who has a masters in EE. Medicine was prestigious, high paying, and probably satisfyingly difficult. However, the 7 years of med school and residency made me scared to dive into a commitment like that. While working 80 hours a week is similar to a Dr., and while I might retire at 50, who is to say I won't pass away at 51. Since graduating, I've been working for companies who have maintain a cutthroat work environment. Which leaves me unhappy with how my career has turned out. Not every engineering job is like this. But I feel like I keep getting hired into extremely challenging jobs. I don't want to job hop again but I also can't do this long term. I am not sure how much more I can be traveling and working long hours. 

One of my hobbies has been automotive work. Racing my car and working on it consumes what little free time I have. Cars make me happy, racing makes me even happier, and to be honest I only work to have a nice car and the ability to work on it. More than anything I would love to either be a cup car driver but that costs $200k+ just to run for one season with a team. I don't make that much money. I could work as a shop hand but that means $12 an hour and usually in California for the shops with more prestige. Local shops do not cater to my appetites for Motorsports. The best of the best get to do Formula 1/3/E. 

I am very lost currently despite hoping this feeling would get better with time. I thought give it a few years and it'll get better. Right now the only thing keeping me is steady income. There have been days where I often question why I'm still doing. I feel like I have no personal investment into my engineering career. And I know there are people who would love to have the expirences I have had. However I feel like I have lost a sense of value in myself and where I am heading in life. 

TLDR I've had many jobs in a short amount of time. I left my last one and considering leaving this one. But I don't want to job hop. I am having a hard time planning for the long term. What should I be doing during this hard time in my life?

To me, it sounds really boring to be designing and laying out wire harnesses and wire in any fashion for aerospace and any industry for that matter when you're an engineer.

I'm an experienced mechanical engineer (apprenticeship, hnc, degree (1st class)) and 10 years in the game. I have an opportunity to leave my current job and approximately 1.5 years salary in savings. 


I am considering starting an engineering consultancy / contractor company which i can expand in to a full mechanical design and validation company. 


Principle Areas


Design - concept to detailed design (including structural analysis and use of multiple tools ive built in this area) 


Validation - data analysis (i have a strong set of stock tools ive developed for cleaning, processing data etc. In multiple formats) + then bespoke work, statistical analysis, instrumentation, guidance on system testing and approvals for regulatory bodies. 


Prototyping: 

This would be outsourced but fully managed by my company. I have good relations for traditional prototyping but not 3D printing (yet) 


My aim would be to move away from individual 1 person contracting and to a more complete project based engineering company with multiple people.

90,Company accused me of verbally committing. I don't think I did anything wrong. Did I handle this incorrectly?,1573585251,"I am a college student in EE graduating after this coming spring. I had recently been put in the lucky situation where I had to decide between two job offers, these are truly exciting times. 

One offer is from a good company within the EE industry for an ASIC design position and one from a large well known company for a Design Verification position. Until recently, the massive company had not yet sent me an official offer but we have had phone calls discussing compensation in which I made it clear that I was still deciding but thanked them for providing me with the information. I will mention that when they were calling about extending me the offer they asked what day they can put as the start date ""just because they need it to send the offer"" and I gave them a date (felt uncomfortable doing that but I figured it was just so they can send the offer). A few days after the official offer came in from said large company, I decided that the culture and job description at the smaller company was better for me, so I decided to accept that offer. I went to reject the offer of the big company and noticed that the offer letter did not have a rejection option (just to be clear I never signed anything). So, I emailed the HR representative that I had been chatting numbers with and said, ""Thank you so much for your time and interest, however I have decided to accept a job that aligns more with what I want to do with my career.""

Soon, I got an email back saying, ""I don't understand, are you rejecting our offer"". I replied that I was. HR rep then accuse me of verbally accepting. I responded that I don't believe I did. I never explicitly verbally indicated that I was accepting the offer. The HR rep calls me and says that they were shocked and would have never accepted the offer if I had never verbally accepted. What confuses me the most, and what my real question is about, is that in this phone call the HR rep said that being in discussions about the salary and other benefits indicated that I was verbally accepting the offer. ""I am going to have to document this"".

91,Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science,1573584369,"Hi, I am a mechanical engineering student who should graduate next year. I have decent grades however I regret entering this field as I didn't really end up enjoying the courses and I don't see myself entering this field in the future. I took a java course in uni, and I really enjoyed it and did well in it. Ever since, I have been learning programming for two years now and I have taken multiple courses on Udemy for different languages like python, JavaScript, and C#. As well as other stuff such as SQL and Linux courses.

I want to pursue some sort of CS job later on. Is it possible to find success in this area with a mechanical engineering degree. If anyone here moved from an engineering background to any CS related field, could you give me some advice on what I should work on and your story of how you succeeded and if a masters is a good idea?

97,Help with managing animosity in a group project,1573577533," 

Hello everyone.

I  have been elected group leader of a 6 man engineering project unofficially because a  various reasons. I also have wanted to team build and encourage  camaraderie from the start of the project, and tried to encourage that  we should all be great friends. Moving on.

People  are coming to me separately complaining that others are not pulling  their weight in the group. I am having to deal with this on a one on one  basis. I do not wish to bring the team morale down so I don't want to  explicitly say to persons that ""person a &amp; b think you're not  pulling your share"" and ""person d and e think person b is not pulling  his fair share"". Animosity and tensions seem to be rising.
