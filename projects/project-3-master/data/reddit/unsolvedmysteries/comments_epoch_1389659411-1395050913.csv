0,CMV: Selling yourself to employers,1395036243,"I sometimes see a lot of different opinions on how to sell yourself to a potential employer.  I sometimes hear that it's best to demonstrate that you can think critically, problem solve, and ""think like an engineer"" (I still don't know what that catch phrase even means).

Personally, I think this is rubbish.  Yes those skills are important, but I don't think that is how employers decide who to hire.

I believe that in all of my past jobs, the ONLY reason any employer was willing to look at my resume, was because I had *relevant prior experience* in what they were working on.  I knew how to program for the web, I knew how to use PIC, I knew how to do *insert thing here*.  They were wiling to look into me because I had already done a little of what they were already doing.  What really wowed them was my completed work.


But then again, I haven't had the best luck finding a new job lately. 

My resume currently highlights the important technical work that I've done over the past few years (briefly), with mention of some awards.  Will I seriously start getting more offers if I put ""problem solver"" &amp; ""critical thinker"" at the top?  Do I really need to put buzzwords?


Change my view?

3,I'm ready to switch careers - please help me figure out where to move next because I am lost,1395020817,"Current situation: Graduated with BSME. No internships. Employed for 2 years at an appliance factory as a generic mechanical engineer.

I do minor design/redesign, update drawings (with stuff like ""make wire 6"" instead of 4""), author engineering change notices, write other documentation (work instructions/documentation/etc), talk to vendors to source cheaper versions of existing parts, create unique configurations of our appliances for certain vendors (we don't sell directly to customers), write test plans, nag the testers to complete the testing, and then do a bit of code writing to play with the accounting database to make sure that we have the right amount of everything for each configuration.

Unfortunately I'm not very happy with my job. Our company is a bit of a revolving door - I think like 50% of the engineering department has been replaced (quit or fired) since I started. I end up with half-completed/half-baked/undefined-by-management projects that have been languishing for years in the hands of multiple of engineers and am unable to complete them since I've already got plenty of my own. We're asked to set monthly goals for ourselves, but I'm unable to meet them half the time since circumstances change (ie: project gets put on the back burner, parts don't come in on time for new configuration build) or I'm assigned to do something new.

Worst of all I'm not picking up any marketable skills at work - I feel that as an engineer I'm only picking up skills useful to my employer and nobody else. Who else would care why assembly X is put together in a certain way anyway? I've gotten some experience with solidworks and design, but only at a very minor level - certainly nothing to write home about. I've seen senior design projects that are more complicated and have more engineering thought &amp; design behind them than what I do. I hate the documentation &amp; pedestrian-level design aspect of my job.

Anyway, enough moping -

I really like coding, but don't want to be doing pure coding (ie: front+back end/business logic type things) - I want to put some of my engineering knowledge (or what I have of it) to work too. Figuring out algorithms/dynamic systems and then implementing them in code to drive things would be a fantastic endeavor for me.

Unfortunately: I have very limited work related experience with that stuff. I have some minor personal projects, but again - nothing to write home about. I'm also a bit confused as to what kind of fields I can get into or where I could fit in with my skill set. I know that it's a bit silly to be looking for a dream job with as little experience as I have, but heck I want to be happier.

5,Multiple disciplines; where would you focus?,1395008139,"tl;dr: If you wanted to hold the skills, experience and mindset to design and develop a computer product from hardware materials, to electronics, to software, what would you study and in which order of importance?

Let's say, for example, I wanted to be able to design and develop a new cellular phone - from the materials used in the hardware, to the physical specifications, electrical design down to and including the processor, the protocols and infrastructure required to run the device, the operating system and application software. I understand that each of these disciplines requires years of expertise and potentially hundreds of people working together to design working systems, but suppose you wanted to develop a design from scratch and completely own the project. What specific areas of knowledge would you study first and foremost?

The relevance to this question is that I would like to eventually get into research and design for a complex system such as a cell phone. I'm currently in school for computer engineering - I tend to think more about how things work in software, but enjoy learning and understanding the hardware as well. I have some software and electronics engineering experience, and I'm not opposed to extensive time spent in school and on side projects to gain an understanding of all of these areas. I suppose what I'd like to know most is what the position (in a work environment) is titled that I could research to see what qualifications people in that position have, or in your own experience, what skills would be needed to end up in this position given a timeline of 10-15 years.

I can specify further if this is too generic, but I didn't want to make this a ""what degree should I get"" thread...

7,Laplace Transform of ODE with 1 IVC and 1 BC?,1395001281,"My prof asked the other day if it would be possible to solve a 2nd order ODE with 1 initial value condition, and 1 boundary condition. Something like this, for example:

y'' + ay' + by = f(t)

With: y(0) = 1, y(1) = 2

I figure you could take the Laplace no problem, and just leave the y'(0) term as a constant until the very end. Then, once you have the final function y, it contains one unknown constant, y'(0). Just plug in the boundary condition (one equation, one unknown) and bam, you solve for y'(0).

My wife started a new company and one of the biggest tasks is making leather disks.  At this point (6 months in) we are buying sheets of leather and using hollow punches to make 1/2""-1"" disks of leather.  We use these disks in EVERYTHING she makes, and we go through about 300 disks per week.  

Current method of creating disks - different hollow punches and a 2.5 lbs hammer with a poly cutting board.  This takes about 3-5 hours per week.  We also use iron pipes that we sharpen an end with as a hollow punch.

Art has vexed me in the past. I never feel as though I can keep my hand straight long enough to double check that my drawing is coming out the way I would have imagined. My drawings still resemble my drawings in elementary school, yet I have always felt complete apathy towards that.

21,Max heat load in server row due to air flow? (Tried to do it myself!),1394866374,"So I'm having an argument with a few people on the maximum heat load a server row can give off given a bunch of conditions. Imagine a shipping crate with just one row of servers in it, with both sides of the computer rack completely sealed (no cross contamination of air).

There is 72,000 cfm of air being supplied at 85degF 25% rh on the ""cold side"" of a computer row. The computers take in at all of the air at a rate of 72,000 cfm and spit out air at 115 degrees F. This is all at 5000 ft of elevation.

What is the heat load going across this? (Real question is what is the maximum amount of IT gear that could be put in this row?)

--------------

I figured there was no latent heat in this at all because computers don't have any moisture or anything...is this correct? My solution was:


The sensible heat gain (Qs) equation is often displayed as follows:

 Qs = 1.085 × cfm × dT

However, the 1.085 in this equation is not a constant. Rather, it is the product of the density (p) and specific heat (Cp) of the air at ""standard air"" conditions,  and the conversion factor of 60 minutes per hour.

Qs = (p × Cp × 60 min/hr) × cfm x dT

The specific heat for 69°F dry air at sea level is 0.241 Btu/lb°F. Therefore, at ""standard air"" conditions, these properties result in the value 1.085.

For your current situation:
The density of air(p) at 5000ft, 100F is .0583 lb/ft^3 (avg of 85 + 115) (http://www.denysschen.com/catalogue/density.aspx)

Qs = 0.0583 lb/ft3 × 0.241 Btu/lb°F × 60 min/hr x 72000 cfm x 30F
Qs= 1820918.88 BTU/HR = 533.6 kW


Should I be using the density of air at the inlet? I figured since density changes with temperature, the only ""true"" way to calculate this would be to integrate along curve of p(T) which I'm just assuming to be linear so I just used the middle. Also am I using the correct specific heat?

--------------------------

Can somebody reassure me if I'm correct or need to change or add something?

It is basically a series of corridors linking foodcourts situated underneath skyscrapers, so it can get very crowded in the morning and in the late afternoon/early evening. Because of this, I assume that the people who designed the complex would want to make it easy for large crowds of people moving in opposite directions to navigate.

But there are two spots in particular where the design of the place seems so terrible that I wonder if it's some kind of design choice intended to slow down traffic. I have [attached a sketch](http://i.imgur.com/BbBNdL8.png) of the two problem areas. Let me know if the drawing isn't clear! The arrows point in the direction the escalators are moving.

Is this deliberate, or just bad design?

I've decided to build a railgun for an highschool-level project, and like to know if anyone could give me an idea how big I should go. 

From the litterature I found, I've understood what components a railgun needs, (capacitors, rails, armature, source, structure etc.), how it'll work theoretically (Lorenz law etc) but I'm not sure what I'll need quantitatively.

Things like how long and large should the rails be? How many Farads for the capacitors? How many amperes will be running through it? What kind of energy source will  need? I'm going for a railgun that would shoot about one gram of metal at 50-100 m/s. Anything technical I should know? Should I reduce the scale of the project?

Also, the interference is sporadic and not constant, so the interference would have to be fluctuating at the outlet if that is the cause.

I am thinking that when the circuit gets stressed/used (ie by another outlet on the same circuit breaker) there is interference created near the unused outlet that is affecting the camera because of increased flow to the outlet (as it is part of the overall circuit).

I started graduate school with the intention of pursuing a PhD, but I met with my former supervisor a few months ago, and he encouraged me to apply for a position in the group based on some discussions about what full-time positions are like in this particular group.  Everything sounded great, I applied, and the company eventually made me an offer which I accepted after some extensive deliberation.  It's in a great location, they do interesting work, and it's a great team to be around, especially as a young engineer--their experience level is first-rate.

&gt;STP-42D3007

&gt;1.8(deg)/Step 6.7ohm

&gt;15540G

The 4 leads would mean it bipolar correct? From what I have found based on the sticker, it's probably a Shinano Kenshi Co. brand and series 42D, though it appears to be a discontinued model since I cannot find it in their product lineup. The closest I could find is the [SST42D series](http://www.shinano.com/motors/docs/SST42D.pdf). I'm not sure if they just replaced STP with SST, but these are 6-wire motors and the ones I have are only 4.

What I'm mostly interested in is the supply voltage and current, and to some extent the torque rating. Since the sticker says 6.7ohm, based on the SST42D table I'm guessing it runs on about 5.2V and just under an amp. Though it looks like the torque could be ~2-3kg-cm.

I suspect 15540G is some kind of inspector # or line it was produced on, etc.

For what it's worth, I did hook it up to an Arduino motor shield and ran it on 5v and was able to successfully get it working using the stepper.h library. I slowly increased the RPMs and somewhere between 140 and 150 it cut out. 140 seemed like it ran fine, then at 150 it dropped quite a bit, then at 160+ it ran at a crawl.

89,Need help processing raw Accelerometer data into a measurement of activity,1394464890,"Hi engineers!

I'm a medicine student currently working on my master thesis, in which we are (among other things) going to measure changes in activity in response to a dose of alcohol.

We want to use the built-in accelerometers in the labs iPods instead of using the ready-made actigraph units such as ActiWatch and ActiCal. Reason being part cost, part the thought of being able to use the patients own smart units for these kind of measurements in the future *(for example, when doing sleep/activity analyses, why issue the patient an ActiWatch for $1000 when he already has a smartwatch with the same tech, that even costs less?)* Potentially it could save a lot of money and help produce many virtually cost-less methods to help in a number of diagnoses and follow-ups. And the easy way is kinda boring.

What I'm sitting with now, is the raw data in excel sheet. I managed (thanks to a post in this sub, thank you /u/SuperDuckQ) to calculate the vector, but how do I go from there? [Link to an example .xlsx sheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/phk166pzeo3z1sq/Vector.xlsx)

What I've learned through internet searches is that I probably need to:
- filter out the gravity using a highpass filter
- possibly filter out disturbances with some kind of lowpass filter (would this really be necessary when measuring such large accelerations? The iPods are going to be on the wrists of the subjects)
- Somehow convert the resulting values into ""expended energy"" or ""distance"" or anything that could be used as measurement for activity for any given point or time interval.

Please, if you have any idea how to do this, I'd be really greatful to hear it! I'd preferably stay in Excel, we do have access to MatLAB but I'm not used to it.

And I basically over the last 7 years forget every single thing I once knew about math, so if you'd kindly ELI5 it a bit for me... :)

Long-term career goal: New product development in medical devices. Have not decided on specifics for what branch of ""medical devices"", but I am thinking more on the side of mechanically-based solutions rather than cellular/pharmaceutical-solutions (ie, stents and scopes and implants and prosthesis are cool, diabetes and bone cement and drugs are probably not my cup of tea). I am aware that robotic prosthesis are probably out of my reach with only a masters, but if I could I would. 

I've found in my undergrad that BME was the wrong way to go for this. I'm a senior graduating in 2 months with 0 medical device industries interested in me because BME was too broad. I've had a recruiter at my career fair tell me, to my face, ""BME is like the ""Economics"" major for engineers--it's what you do when you don't know what you want to do."" Live and learn.  

But now that I'm considering grad school, I'm finding myself questioning the same thing again. The two programs I'm weighing are:  

1) ""Masters of Translational Medicine"": more broad, emphasizing at it's core a capstone design-based project, clinical knowledge and the steps of the translational pathway (FDA regulations, etc), and a sprinkling of business/entrepreneurship courses. The capstone project has a potential of spawning into it's own startup, though probably unlikely. What worries me most is: will employers look at this title of 'translational medicine"" and be confused what skills I have? Would they take a MechE over me because they know what ""MechE"" means?  

It may also be worth noting I have experiences like the capstone proejct (team-based 1-year projects for med device design) already on my resume, but I truly love the experience because you can see the entire design process from the problem defined in the clinical setting through prototyping and testing and validation and all the fun things. 

2) ""Masters of Mechanical Engineering: Biomechanical engineering"": a more traditional, non-thesis/research-based masters program that is all about the courses. 1/3 on my focus area (biomechanics), 1/3 on general mechanical engineering (aka a lot of things a BME would not know), and 1/3 on broadening your horizons with other life science/STEM-but-not-mechE courses (why do I have to do this as a grad student?). I worry that as a BME, I might be at an incredible disadvantage here, considering I haven't drawn a free body diagram since AP Physics in high school. But I got into the program, so someone has faith in me, right?

25,Impeller design for HVLP vs LPHV (or low/high static lift).,1394254860,"Could anyone compare and contrast a [dust collector](http://www.amazon.com/SHOP-FOX-W1727-Dust-Collector/dp/B001R23T44/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394249859&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dust+collector) vs [shop vacuum](http://www.amazon.com/Shop-Vac-9650610-3-0-Peak-Horsepower-6-Gallon/dp/B0041T4U3E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394249902&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=shop+vac).

Dust collectors are designed to move a [high volume of air but don't have a lot of static lift](http://www.pennstateind.com/store/TEMP1535S.html?prodpage=1TE). It's designed to move a lot of dust but don't do well if you 'clog' them. Where as with a shop vac have lower flow rates but have better static lift. (~90""H2O/6.6""Hg/7.5 kPa abs).  With 406""H2O/29.92""Hg/0 kPa being the theoretical maximum.

Cincinnati Fan has a [nice document](http://www.cincinnatifan.com/catalogs/EngData-203-internet.pdf) that shows the different wheel types and then it loses me in tables I try to block out of my memory. I'm pretty sure both types of vacuums (well all vacuums cleaner) use a variation of the centrifugal blower.

A few questions:

1) What is the theoretical and real world max static lift that you can achieve with a centrifugal blower vs a positive displacement pump (which is what most vacuum pumps use).

2) What are the different parameters that determine what a centrifugal blowers specs are? Would there be a way to do something similar to a VNT turbo[[gif](http://www.mechanicalengineeringblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/01variableturbinegeometryturbochargervtgsequence.gif)] [[html5](http://gfycat.com/SlushyWickedBighornedsheep)] to change those specs?

3) Is there any type of positive displacement pump that has a similar performance/size to a centrifugal blower? You can hold a 1000 cfm centrifugal fan in your arms. 

4) Some fans are 'ok' with being operated in a vacuum, some don't. For example if I 'stall' my fan (doing static vacuum tests). Is this more of a function of the motor? Lower air flow = no load = motor speeds up = it gets hot since it's an unregulated motor. Or do centrifugal pumps not like to be run in a vacuum? (Is there such thing as cavitation with air?). But if you designed the motor that could operate at the higher speeds with either better cooling or speed control.

5) How does whether it's blower or a sucker affect the design. For example a shop vac and dust vac vs a HVAC fan. Where one has to draw through the system vs the other what blows through it? HVAC blowers seem to have lots of small flat blades (Squirrel cage) vs a dust fan.

5a) Does it affect the ducting? For example a 1000 cfm centrifugal fan needs a large intake or needs to operate as close atmospheric as possible. Where as as a blower it needs a bit of resistance from the system. Or does a centrifugal fan just always operate best in an 'open' atmosphere?

So, I'm having to use Aspen to design a chemical process for my senior design. Think basic feed streams, reactor, separator that sends feed to the purification leg, and the rest to be purified for recycle. 

Well, my design requires a recycle feed. Things tend to get a bit hairy. I had one case where it would consistently converge and give proper sensible answers repeatedly. I could save it, come back open it up and run it and it would go just fine. 

However, I discovered a design flaw and once fixed has made the design much more finicky. I found that by tweaking various bits and pieces of my rad frac distillation column, I could get it to converge consistently. However, upon saving (as a back up file), that once I opened it and ran the simulation again, it would not converge.

So my plan is to work at a research lab as a volunteer where I can learn relevant skills that are useful in the industry as well. I can swallow my pride and work in the food services for a while, but does volunteering at a local university laboratory part time count as a previous work experience, provided that I've learned the relevant techniques and skills? Would companies still take that seriously, or will they just laugh at my resume? If they won't care for it, what should I do to prepare for industry at that point?

I guess another way to phrase this question is: if you are in industry, do you guys hire people whose first post-graduation jobs were lab techs and are seeking to transition into industry? Do they have any disadvantage over other folks?

Here is a little bit of information about what one would look like and what materials would have been used to construct one, from Wikipedia:

""Built in receding tiers upon a rectangular ... or square platform, the ziggurat was a pyramidal structure with a flat top. Sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had astrological significance... The temple is thought to have been painted ... there were three staircases leading to the temple [on the top tier], two of which (side flanked) were thought to have only ascended half the ziggurat's height."" Referring here to Etemenanki, the ziggurat of the Temple of Marduk in Babylon: http://www.kadingirra.com/images/etemenanki01.jpg [11] (and) http://www.livius.org/a/1/mesopotamia/etemenanki_drawing.gif [12]

A cuneiform tablet written in 229 BC (a copy of an older tablet) describes Etemenaki as having seven levels with a height of seven stocks, 91 meters or 299 ft, and a footprint measuring 91 x 91 meters (the footprint was confirmed by excavations conducted by Robert Koldewey in 1913). These figures are from: http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/esagila-tablet[13] . The eastern staircase on the south side was calculated to be 102.86 ft high (~31.35 m * 3.281 ft/m). The inclination of the staircases was equivalent to the ratio 8:11, so for every 11 units of length the steps rise 8 units. Figures were found here: http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Der+Tempelturm+Etemenanki+in+Babylon.-a021222547[14] This website has a detailed article about Etemenanki, if you want even more detail. The ziggurat at Ur has a footprint measured at 64 x 46 m (210 x 150 ft).

I know that there is a building in CA that their Department of General Services called The Ziggurat, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ziggurat[15] , and it cost $60 million USD (http://www.emporis.com/building/the-ziggurat-building-west-sacramento-ca-usa[16] ), but I am not envisioning an office building, I would want a faithful recreation.

Let's say that no sun baked bricks would be used in my hypothetical construction idea. I get the impression that the bottom two or three levels were solid and had exterior stairs, and that the, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh layers, and crowning single floored temple had internal floorplans with either internal, and maybe external, staircases. I am curious how much extra it would cost if you wanted trees and/or gardens on a few of the tiers. Maybe a more practical/modern construction method could be used to build the bottom two layers to avoid having to use so many bricks to create two solid layers, but I would want to know which engineering method's would last the longest.

- Is it possible to make it almost entirely out of aluminium? It will be running on butane lighter-fluid, I think it will involve less pressure than petrol, so it doesn't have to cope with huge forces.

91,[Mechanical] GE/Hotpoint Refrig Evap Fan Motor,1393904267,"I just replace my evaporator motor fan as shown on this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWGdWvQp1Bo

It was easy to do and fixed the problem which was a loud vibration, groaning noise when the fan was running. I used the old fan blade and the old rubber mounting grommets but I've got new grommets on order as I didn't know I would need them till I took it a part.

The old fan motor had bad bushings which was why it was making so much noise. The new fan motor is quiet but I hear an audible hum or whirling sound and I was thinking that maybe this design is flawed.  The mount, grommets, fan and motor assembly sound like they are resonating at an audible frequency. Here is a link to one of the motor mounting grommets;

http://www.amazon.com/General-Electric-WR02X12008-Evaporator-Grommet/dp/B00ECV5YWM

My theory is that this resonance is what caused the motor bushings to fail and deteriorated the grommets. I'm guessing the new grommets would only mask the problem as other people with this model are complaining that the motor only lasts about 4-5 years before the motor bushings fail.

So my question is two-fold. First, is there an easy way to determine what frequency the assembly is resonating at? Second, if I figure out the resonance frequency can I add or take out mass from the motor or the mounting structure to change the resonance frequency so it doesn't couple with the rotating fan frequency and destroy my new motor? If I add weights or drill holes in the mounting bracket (change the mass) can I change the dynamics enough to stop the resonance?  If I change mass of the system would it be better, from a vibration perspective and wear on the motor bushings, to add mass to lower the resonance frequency or remove mass to raise the resonance frequency. TIA

UPDATE: I replaced the rubber grommets with new ones and I stiffened the bracket with some zip ties. I also put a rubber bumper against the back grommet opposite the fan. The way  the bracket is designed the grommets only weakly captured the plastic edge of the motor, too much slop. The bumper forces the motor forward and keeps the motor firmly seated in the grommets. No more whirring sound, no more audible resonance so hopefully this mod allows the motor to last longer than 4 years. PM me if someone wants details.

99,New Pipeline Controller needing help with calculating line fills.,1393881883,"Hello fellow redditors!

I have a question regarding oil/gas pipelines and I hope I have come to the right place!   

I am a new Pipeline Controller in training for a smaller pipeline company.  This company hasn’t hired any new, fresh controllers in a long time and because of that they haven’t had any had much change over the years.  The more seasoned controllers tend to do things the way they always have and don’t really look for new ideas.  My boss has asked me to keep a lookout for new ideas and procedures that may better the way we do things.

One thing I noticed is the way we calculate deliveries into certain terminals along one of our major (longer) pipe lines.  I can’t help but think “There has GOT to be a better way to do this!”
Say the line starts at Station A and travels by stations B, C, and D, and finally ends at Station E in that order.  We often send different types of products in different barrel amounts to be delivered in one of the 4 stations/terminals (B, C, D, or E).  Right now we are calculating by hand when batches will arrive at which terminal in relation to other deliveries at other terminals.  

Example:
Let’s say the line fill from Terminal D to E is 50,000 barrels.  There is a 75,000 barrel batch going to terminal E, followed by a 10,000 barrel batch going to D.  When the barrel amount going into terminal E reaches 25,000 barrels on the meter, then the second batch should be arriving at terminal D at that moment.  That is when we should close terminal E and open D.

This example is only taking the last two terminals (D and E) into account.  It obviously gets much more complex when you take into account the other line fills between A, B, C, D, and E.  Sometimes we will only be going into terminal E for a few thousand barrels when the batch going to C arrives at terminal C and then we only go into that terminal for a few thousand when the batch going to station B arrives at B.

My question is this:  Does anyone know of any software or database I could set up to just plug in the numbers of line fills, batch sizes and delivery destinations and this would all be calculated for me?  It could tell me “send x barrels to station D, then open into C for X amount of barrels” and so on.  There is just too much room for human error right now, especially for a new guy like myself. 

So what do you think, engineers of Reddit?  Any ideas?

I was just recently thinking about it and was wondering if there was a relatively low cost way to make it.

The idea is basically a large flatbed plotter (4'x4') that reproduces the Sierpinski triangle through the random inputs of students. My thought was to mount some kind of plotting device in the display case with three buttons accessible to passersby. The buttons would correspond to the three initial vertices of the triangle. The plotter would initially be moved to a random location within the triangle and anyone could push one of the buttons which would move the plotter 1/2 the distance to that vertex and make a mark. Given a large enough sheet of paper and fine enough pen, I was thinking of a setup that could recreate the triangle over a semester.

Is this something you could make for $100 or so?

[Here's the datasheet it's from.](http://www.ispsupplies.com/F40-N-Spec-2.pdf)

---

So first up, I'm well aware this is an elevation vs gain chart across a range of frequencies.

My confusion however is how I tell what the gain is at (eg) +30 degrees.

The stated specs indicate that it has a max gain of 7dBi at 5.(x)GHz, which is obviously the 2 main lobes. Now, I did some searching and found that those numbers on the side would be unitless gain, as the ""5"" mark lines up with the blue dashed circle (I checked via image editor) that goes just below the peaks of the main lobes.

As per the gain decibel conversion; G(dBi) = 10*log10(G)

and 5 gain = 7dBi gain, which matches up.

---

However, how would I go about finding what the decibel rating is at (for example) 30 degrees elevation, considering it's unitless gain is roughly (for the 5.85GHz frequency) -5?

Or am I completely off track and those numbers refer to something else? I suppose they could be gain in dBi, but they would've done some hacky rounding to get to claim it goes to 7dBi.",AskEngineers,Dragon029,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1zaxb2/how_do_i_read_this_antenna_gain_diagram/

It's not a complicated design but I just can't quite wrap my head around the formulas to calculate the required strengths, or know exactly which formulas to use.

The design is a square box, with an internal span of 12 metres. I'd like to have I-beams (across the span, supported at the ends) holding hardwood joists. I was thinking about spacing the I-beams out about 1 to 2 metres apart - so either at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, or 0, 1, 2 ...

I know it's not exactly a simple thing to figure out but I need some sort of ""dummy's guide"" or a translation tool.

Edit: There seems to be a presumption that I'd take the info and then start building this without consulting an engineer *and* an architect.

40,Best way to measure fuel amount in a motorcycle gas tank?,1393624494,"Greetings Engineers,

I wondering if anyone can give me some ideas on the best way to measure the amount of fuel in a motorcycle gas tank that has no fuel meter, and the gas tank straddles the frame. Also, it is a carbuerated bike, with an open air tank (air pressure above the fuel in the tank is the same as atmospheric), although I might add a EFI system to the bike, which I believe would include sealing the tank, but I'm not sure.

So the basic idea is to measure the amount of fuel from one side of the tank, and just use the other side as a ""reserve"". This will make it far easier to create.

I just don't know how to measure it. I was thinking that maybe I could measure the amount of pressure applied to a sensor just below the petcock, using a T-junction and a fuel resistant pressure sensor. I did some quick research and calculating to determine how much the pressure would change with a change in temperature, but since the tank is open, pressure shouldn't be an issue, until I add EFI. I'll also note that this seems to be the easiest route.

I also though about actually sticking a force sensor inside the tank itself, not sure how I would accomplish that, but it would be measuring the weight, so it shouldn't be effected by a change in temperature. I also don't believe that a change from carb to EFI would effect it.

* Can anyone in the US auto industry tell me what the big three are doing for diesel domestically?

* I'm tempted by a travelling job, does anyone in the industry see world travel?
* Are diesel engine development companies even slightly interested in bachelor's candidates or is a masters/phd pretty much required?
* Is the general feeling around the industry one of optimism, pessimism, or indifference? I'm thinking about the rise of alternative energies and stricter emissions controls, but also the growing popularity of diesel as opposed to spark ignition, and the stabilizing effect of the non-consumer industrial market.

Now if anyone has experience with variable displacement pumps and designing systems like this then I would be more than happy to pay someone for taking the time to answer my questions (I have tons more too) and troubleshoot this, maybe some bitcoin or PayPal.

So I have a hydraulic pump running off a diesel engine, and I want it to run two seperate motors that spin an air compressor and a water pump. My real problem is figuring out what rpms to run everything at and what motors to get to reach those rpms.

My pump is a vickers PVE21, a variable displacement pump. Its displacement is 45 cubic cm, and max pressure is 2700 psi.

The air compressor is 5hp rated, and the max rpm is 1100, but I will likely be running it about 700-800 rpms.

The motor does have a pulley attachment at the shaft. I think the motor may have been to a dryer or washing machine but I honestly have no way of knowing. 

I realize I could use either a gearbox or a smaller or larger pulley to change the speed, but I would like to be able to change the speed while in operation and don't want to spend a ton on a variable speed gear box. Anyway is it safe for me to use a dimmer plug / switch to control the speed of the motor? what other results can I expect from decreasing the current to the motor other than reduced speed?

87,Pipeline Automation Questions,1393389695,"Hello gentlemen,

I'm a technician working on a project for a pretty sizable company.  The thing is, I'm scared as heck!  I really have limited experience with automation and I'd really like to get some help on this.  I feel like I have a good understanding of the theory, but I'm just having difficulty relating that to the real world.  It seems like I'm the youngest guy on the job site for this type of industry and it makes me feel so nervous about things I dont know.

I've attached a picture to indicate what I'm dealing with. Tank on the left there, two pumps (one booster, one VFD).  I don't feel like it's super difficult.  So I had a few questions hopefully someone a bit more senior to me could help me with!

http://postimg.org/image/f2p3dp97h/full/

1  - Starting against closed discharged valves.  Is this always a requirement?  I've read about it a bit online, and I'm having trouble understanding if this is something that should be required.  ie the permissive to start the pump should be an open suction and a closed discharge - when we start the pump the discharge would then begin opening.  Theoretically I'm having difficulty understanding what impact this will have on anything.  If I start the pump with or without a closed discharge, won't I immediately start off at my maximum head point on my HQ curve?  And shouldn't I ultimately move down that curve till I reach the intersection point of my system curve and HQ curve?  I think maybe one misunderstanding here is if the system curve is different when the line is empty/full?  ie system curve is based off of a wet line from your start point to your end point; if it's not full, then maybe things are different when you start your pump? 

2 - I have suction pressure transmitters at both pumps.  For the first pump, how exactly do I utilize that suction pressure?  Should I have a permissive to only alarm this value when the pump is running?  I would think that if the suction valve is closed, then I probably will have a low suction pressure.  And when I open that valve, it will still take a split second for the fluid coming from the tank to press against the inlet of the pump.  What would you suggest as a standard?  I know that I shouldn't be starting the pump with low suction pressure, but I'm starting to think that I will have low suction pressure quite often if I don't bypass it while it's not running.  

The same goes for the pump downstream.  When I turn on that booster pump, it should take some time to build up pressure once I've opened the suction valve of my VFD pump... so should I bypass that low suction pressure for a bit before trying to start my VFD pump?  I know someone had mentioned to me to bypass this alarm for a certain amount of time after I've started my booster pumps.  But doesn't that bring in more problems?  So I start my booster pumps then I immediately turn on my VFD without looking at what my suction pressure is?  Isn't there a possibility of cavitation while the suction pressure transmitter is bypassed?

3 - So this last thing is basically related to the previous questions.  Firstly, from 1.)  I'm wondering if when these pumps are primed (ie product flowing, close discharge valve then shut down pump and then close suction - suction pressure remains high.) then the suction pressure will be pretty high and we will almost always have a substantial suction pressure, regardless of if the inlet valves for each pump are open/closed.  I guess I'm looking ahead to commission and wondering if maybe the only time I would bypass the suction pressure is during the immediate start up when all the pumps aren't yet primed and no product has flown through the line.

I know this is a lot, and I'm not really sure what to expect here.  I feel like I've spent a lot of time trying to get these answers from various other sources and I haven't had much luck.  I'm really starting to freak out here because I feel like there is a lot expensive mistakes that could occur here;  I really want this to go perfect.

Any help would be so comforting right now!

90,Questions regarding the creation and use of a catalytic converter,1393376619,"I am wondering if someone could help me figure out a problem I am encountering while working on a long term project in school. A friend and I are trying to find a way to fix the problems with plasma speakers to make it possible to bring them to the general market.

**The problem with plasma speakers:**

Plasma speakers create sound with plasma (Duh) and this comes with consequences. For plasma to be maintained ionizable gas must be present, and it can either be provided manually or the speaker can take it from ambient air. Providing it manually is an absolute pain, so ambient air is the only option. **However,** when ambient air is ionized ozone and nitrous oxide are produced.

Naturally the ozone and nitrous oxide are a problem. My friend and I have done a good amount of research, and we think that the best way to solve this problem would be to use some sort of carbon filter or catalytic converter to remove the byproducts thus making the speakers fit for everyday use.

**The questions:**

Would anybody be able to offer advice on which option would produce the best results?

94,Possibilities of construction work in Canada after having worked abroad for 30+ years.,1393347505,"My dad graduated a civil engineer from a foreign university in 1980, and spent the rest of his time working in construction in various places in Africa and the Middle East. 

Primarily, he is a director of a large construction company in West Africa, and is essentially its sole engineer. He designs everything and does the planning and management and site inspections etc. And he works 7 days a week. 

He keeps up to date with his knowledge and has learned new stuff as well. Everything from bridges to airports to seawalls to concrete domes and buildings too.
. And he has learned software. Autodesk stuff and Revit for construction, a bunch of others for project management... 

Now he might finally be throwing in the gauntlet and coming to Edmonton in Canada, but he is worried that his lack of Canadian experience would not allow him to find a job, or that he would have to start at a basic level. He also thinks that he would need to do a Masters first. 

My understanding is that, apart from actual codes, engineering is the same wherever you go. And since he has worked in multiple countries with completely different codes, learning Alberta's shouldn't be a problem. And I think that masters is essentially irrelevant after all that experience. 

I suggested he make a proper profile on LinkedIn, and apply for project management positions. Ideally, he would leave the actual calculations and designs to the younger engineers, and he would still be doing the rest of his current job. 

What do you guys think? Is it possible to find a good job with no local experience? Do you suggest any sites in particular? What salary should he be aiming for? 

For what it's worth, he is looking to become a member of APEGA too. He would need that to sign off on things AFAIK, but would his job hunt have to wait until after he gets it? Or can he apply before? For similar jobs or only basic ones?

**Background Info Rant**

I live in a country where once you have graduated, you must give in to the army draft. Usually companies will not hire you for a full time position until they know your military status as exempt or postponed. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Design Engineering this past January.

**My Problem**
I have to wait until October to finish the military draft papers. So I will not be able to work a full time position in my field. What happens are graduates would usually work a part time position, but that only happens if you know someone who can set that up for you.

So as I have no one that can get me in a company like that, I had to look for a job elsewhere and what I found are call center agencies or telesales and such.

**Choices**
The choices I have are work at a call center until October and either get drafted into the army or be exempt, and if exempt I would seek employment at a company in my field. Or I can start my Postgraduate courses and be on track for a Masters Degree but without a job.

I'm one of those coin miners in my off computer time, which means my room (I live in an apartment) gets fairly warm with the heat given off by my computer. Which just means I pay less for my heating bill. But I've been thinking, hey can I use that heat to power some form of engine? And I can, technically. I could remove the fans from the gpu and put a sterling engine (Originally I was thinking I could somehow move the heat and use it for a steam engine, but that requires at least boiling temperatures, which aren't conducive to running a computer) on it. 

But then the problem remains, a sterling engine is intended to keep some of the heat from escaping otherwise it loses efficiency, while I need my heat to remain constant or lower, because it would fry the gpu.

 take a 4 year mechanical eng. degree route at a fairly respectable school, 

or take a 4 year engineering degree at a second rate school that incorporates a technologist diploma into the curriculum (yes coursework is fairly high) and graduate with a B. Eng and a technologist diploma.

24,VFD Speed Feedback,1393128725,"Hey guys,

Noob electrician here having to wire some stuff up.

Basically, a PLC is controlling a VFD with an analog signal to the VFD, a digital output, and then there's a feedback from the VFD to the PLC.

I'm a bit confused about what the feedback is supposed to measure... is it somehow tied to the speed of the motor the VFD is feeding?  I'm assuming that the VFD does not output a signal to the motor unless the discrete input to the VFD is high.  And the frequency that goes to the motor will be very close to the input 4-20ma (35-60Hz) signal.  But again, how does the feedback come into play?  Is it just measuring the actual frequency of the signal going to the motor?  Or could it be measuring the speed of the actual motor.

The tag in my electrical diagrams is VFD speed feed back, so does this mean it's measuring the frequency of the signal controlling the VFD?

They're right on the border between Vancouver and Burnaby (Boundary Rd), all pointed toward Vancouver. I figure that's no coincidence. I can't figure out what they'd be for, though - they're not cell towers, and I'm not sure why they would all be pointed toward Vancouver with none toward Burnaby (I'm guessing either some sort of service Telus only wants to provide to Vancouver, or else something to do with Burnaby RF regulations?)

If I put an eye-bolt horizontally through one of the beams and a metal plate on the other side (hanging the heavy thing off one side of the beam), will the bolt act as a lever and split the beam, or will the metal plate be enough to spread out of the force?

I have a robotic arm required to be 1.5M long and support a mass of 10kg at the end effector.

I figure to take the effective torque required is the moment of the end mass, 10kg x 1.5m x 9.81 = 147.15Nm 

and the mass of the arm itself acting at halfway along the beam 
as (12kg x 0.75m x 9.81) = 88.29Nm 



so my motor should have a torque of 235.44Nm, call it 250Nm.

1- I'll have no way to humidify when the ambient humidity is very low. Can I just use an water atomizing nozzle with an electronic valve?

2- I don't know if I can get the kind of RH stability I need with a standard compressor unless I use a variable frequency drive (expensive) or pulse width modulation (need a dc compressor).

(xpost from askreddit),1392891957,"Backround: I'm currently studying at a Technical university in Sweden. We have been asigned a project about life saving at sea. Today the ships on the sea have plans and rules about evacuating people off the boats into life rafts if a disaster happens. The problem is to pick up the life rafts from the open ocean. Problem: Every big ship has crane on the deck. With this crane it is possible for ships who are passing a shipwreck to pick up whole life rafts wich contain the people evacuated from the shipwreck. It is possible to lower down sailors to water surface, they approach the life raft and hook on a line wich can lift up the raft and save the shipwrecked. This is not a good solution because it means risking the sailors' life. What we want to do is to find a way to get hook from the top of the crane to the life raft and hook it on. Without using any sailors on watersurfare nor using the people on the life raft. So brilliant reddit, do you have any ideas? Think outside the BOX! Sorry about the bad english...

67,[Serious] Why is the Crower (Leonard Dyer) Six Stroke a bad idea?,1392888806,"This was posted in Askreddit and had noone but the modbot reply, I am hoping i will have better luck here.

For those playing at home with no idea what this might be, i am referring to the idea of injecting water after the ejection of the exhaust of the first 4 strokes, allowing it to expand into steam (5th) and then ejection of steam (6th)

This gives a reasonably large efficiency boost (more power out for fuel in), at the cost of having to use distilled water.

What are the shortcomings of this design, what is preventing it from being used in the wider market?

I was thinking that an ideal use would be as a small to moderate size stationary power generation (backup generators, remote offgrid, etc) This would have advantages on gas turbine of quicker start up, and perhaps easier servicing (easier to find mechanics?)

Distilled water could be produced on site from the waste heat (vacuum distillation) for a small energy penalty

They recently changed the design; it looks like the outer walls are 2"" thick now instead of 3"". They were and still are comprised of particleboard with a laminate cover - materials have not changed.

The old design is highly durable compared to similar Walmart/Target shelving as the outer walls are so thick and the vertical supports keep the shelves from bowing under weight. Two things the cheaper alternatives lack.

Will the reduction in outer wall thickness negatively affect the weight of records each shelf can hold? From a layman's POV, it doesn't appear anything would change as far as weight capacity *within* the unit would go. The only downside I see is maybe the thinner outer walls would prevent stacking one or more units on top of another unit.

[BTW My engineering ""experience"" amounts to living with 6 engineering students through college...so completely second hand knowledge.]

I am doing a study on why subways/train lines end up where they do. I am mostly trying to evaluate this from a social science perspective with a starting point of ""the trains could anywhere- why did they go to these particular neighborhoods (looking at race, income, property value, etc).

But then it occurred to me that even if there were no buildings, it's probably not the case that you can build a subway anywhere you wanted. There are probably types of rocks, or underground water supplies, or other considerations as what makes suitable areas for tunneling for subways.

So what I am looking for is some sort of introductory guide, or even just a list of things that engineers take into account when deciding if a subway can be built in a certain stretch of land. Things like:

""You can't dig a tunnel through X rock""
""You can't build within Z feet of an aquifer""
""You can't build under volcanoes""
etc.

I know I'm asking for a pretty simple answer to a undoubtedly complex question, but maybe someone can get me started? All I've really found so far is:

0,Problem with integration,1392753875,"For whatever reason, this isn't making sense in my head.  I have a fluid system that's pressure based, so the height of the reservoir plays a direct role in the flow rate through the system.  I have found, through testing, that the instantaneous flow rate (in cc/min) is given by the equation 0.6837*h+95.329.  The reservoir itself is cylindrical with diameter of 14.7cm.

Now, if I want to find the time it will take to deliver a certain volume from a given base reservoir height, my head is just missing something.  It's been too long since I've done this, I suppose.  So let's say I want to deliver 1000 cc of fluid and place the reservoir base at 10 cm.  The column of fluid would be 5.89 cm tall.  How would I find the time it takes to deliver this?

My thought process:

Velocity = f(h);

Volume = f(h) * t;

dV = f(h)*dt;

16,"Building a wind turbine, need help understanding the motor.",1392666730,"Hi all!

Since I know next to nothing about wind turbines, I thought it'd be best if I were to build one myself. I'm also trying to understand the inner workings of the motor as that too will be DIY. After reading a bit online, it seems a permanent magnet motor seems to be the way to go. This is what I learned so far (please correct me):

An electric motor is suprisingly simple. It consists of two rotating disks: one with (strong) magnets and another one with coils, like [this](http://www.orientalmotor.com/images/mainContent/08-40-b.jpg). For a three phase motor (which is the most reliable) three ""groups"" of coils are needed. Furthermore, the amount of windings of the coil (together with Δflux) determines the output voltage. 

After generating the AC, we need to convert it to DC to do something useful with it (transform it to AC again for grid-tie, charge batteries, etc.). This is done with a simple circuit called a [3-phase full-wave rectifier](http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/03267.png). 

I hope my assumptions are correct, which led me to the following questions:

* Does the amount of windings determine the 'resistance' the coil will offer to the rotating magnets? (Does it become harder to rotate the blades if the amount of windings goes up?) If not, is there an optimum amount of windings (V*I = max)?

* If the amount of windings does not determine the resistance, what does?

* A lot of [designs](http://www.stanford.edu/~hydrobay/lookat/big/pmg/fnfig-03.jpg) incorporate more than one magnet. Does it matter - as long as the poles are alternating - how many magnets I use? And what about coils?

18,"Undergrad ME, looking to patent. Need for advice.",1392656298,"As the title says, I'm an undergrad mechanical engineer. For obvious reasons, I will be very vague in my description of my situation. So, please bare with me. (BTW, This is in the U.S. but I'm open to advice from all corners of the world.)

I have an idea with applications in a very competitive, multi-billion dollar industry. Fortunately for me, the idea was simple enough that I was able to test it on my own, without breaking the bank. I've been pretty excited that it actually works and have been doing research to confirm that it hasn't been done before and that there is an actual market for it. I believe that I've confirmed both, to the best of my ability. I think that the patent is a novel departure from what is conventional for the industry. It uses the same principle that has been used for decades, but applies them in a new way, which provides for a new level of freedom. Devices with a similar purpose have been produced, which are several times more complicated and prone to breaking, yet still are quite limited compared to my design. In terms of function, my design is insanely simple (It is barely more complicated than the modern, basic mechanism) and provides what I can only imagine would be an amazing level of freedom on a full-scale model. Still, I fear that the failures of past devices makes the general industry weary of anything other than the conventional.  

This is my situation. I can attempt to patent this on my own, since I've found a lawyer who is actually willing to do it for a price that is reasonable for a student. However, I fear that it STILL might not be worth it, because I'll have to contend with the egos of the more experienced engineers in the industry in order for the patent to help my career. 

Last year, I was working for a company that might be interested in such a patent. So, given my contacts, I could possibly get this company to pay for the patent. The con is that they'll own the patent. The pro is that they won't be knocking on my door in a few years with a lawsuit claiming that they are obligated to own a piece of my work, since I may have came up with the idea while working for them. Which, by the way, would be un-true.

So, despite the fact that this is a terrible description, I'm hoping that someone on here might have some experience with similar situations and be able to help me consider the pros and cons of the options available to me. 

Thanks, in advance!

TL,DR: I'm an undergrad ME. Designed something that I want to patent. Might be worth millions, might not. I can patent  it myself and risk the possibility a huge corporation lawyering up and claiming ownership. Or, I can use my contacts in that same company to get that patent paid for and receive what would probably be very little compensation in exchange for ownership of the patent.

32,Software for System/Timing Diagrams,1392537544,"Hey all,

I'm an AeroE, working on my masters. More specifically, I'm writing my thesis to graduate in May.

My thesis work centers around the development of a new system for flow measurement using lasers. The solution involves the interaction of several systems that act independently of each other, but exchange some information for triggering and control. I am looking to describe how these systems interact in response to one another.

The problem is that these interactions are too complex to reasonably explain in text without it getting all sorts of confusing. So, I am looking for a good way to graphically map these interactions out and show the direction that data is moving. This will be presented to a committee who hasn't necessarily seen the apparatus I work on, so clarity is important.

I have tried making a sort of ""systems of circles"" map in GIMP, but I can see it getting messy pretty quickly. I have also mulled over the idea of simply making a diagram for every 'step' of the interaction. I.E - ""Blah blah during this phase blah blah..."", with a picture of the systems involved during the phase with arrows indicating data travel, and then another picture for another phase, and so on. This will probably have the clearest photos, but will result in a descent number of them. I'm also looking for this to look reasonably professional, not ""made by a grad student in image software by hand"" - so that presents an issue too.

What do you guys do to represent the flow of information between systems?

It's been suggested to me to use square waves in MATLAB, or simply take a stab in GIMP/Photoshop at it, but I feel like that result won't be very professional. Is there a good software package for making timing diagrams similar to the image I linked to above?

35,"To those in the US, is it normal and ok to be in 50k+ debt after college?",1392523560,"Hi, I am a high school senior who is very interested in engineering and recently, I have been accepted as a freshman for University Illinois Urbana Champaign for Materials Science And Engineering. Although I do not have an exact number yet, I estimate I will have at least 50k in loans by the time I graduate (65k sounds more reasonable) with my Bachelor's degree if I attend UIllinois. This scares me, although I would like to attend this school, especially since I hear this it has great engineering programs. I know that a good school won't do anything if you yourself don't work hard, but I think a good school would offer a better education, networking and hopefully a better job than a not-so-good school. I go to a pretty rigorous high school and am used to doing a lot of work, studying hours on end, very little sleep, etc. 




My question is, should I attend this school to get an engineering degree even if I get into debt? Is it worth paying 65k for a top 5 school compared to going to a much cheaper, but unknown state university (assuming I put effort into whatever college I attend)? If 50-65k debt is too much, how much would you say is the debt ""limit"" to attend a good school? It would be nice to hear some advice from real engineers.

39,Advice on building a prototype automatic guitar tuner?,1392501624,"I am currently in the middle of building a prototype automatic guitar and I am not sure if I am going about it the right way.

The tuner works as follows. It will detect the two fundamental frequencies of two plucked guitar strings from a guitar pickup. These frequencies will be transmitted to an Arduino Uno board. The Arduino will then calculate the fundamental frequencies and compare them to a particular set of set point frequencies. The error between the set point frequencies and the actual fundamental frequencies is calculated and the Arduino relays the appropriate action to two D.C motors. The motors will then turn the tuning pegs correct amount to tune the strings.

Since Arduino only reads in DC voltages and the output signals from the guitar pickup are AC, I am going to use a frequency to voltage converter. However, I am not sure that the output from the converter will be DC.

The two strings been used are the High E (329.6 Hz) and the Low E (82.4 Hz). Since both strings will have harmonics present, signal filtering will be needed to isolate the fundamental frequencies of both strings. I am not entirely sure what filtering to use. I was thinking of a bandpass filter for each string.

I am going to use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in Arduino to accurately calculate the fundamental frequencies. I don't know at this stage if Arduino has the processing power to execute a FFT.

Finally should I do the frequency to voltage conversion first or the signal filtering. Does it matter which one is done first?

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

43,Off road axle truss design question,1392476520,"I'm in the process of building up an old International Scout with an eye towards eventually competing in Score and Norra baja style racing.  The kind of pounding I'm planning on doing with this truck has a habit of bending axles in short order, so I'm going to need to design some sort of truss or reinforcement in order to make it survive.  The typical design is something like this: http://oi54.tinypic.com/wak5jk.jpg.  The inherent problem with this design is that it limits the amount of upward suspension travel because the truss starts to interfere with things like the oil pan.  Mounting it on the bottom decreases ground clearance.

So in pondering the forces involved, I started wondering if a truss all the way across the axle was even necessary.   This is a leaf spring truck with the shocks mounted on the extreme end of the axles.  It seems like a truss that extends past the spring and shock mounting points is of minimal benefit, since the middle of the axle is just ""along for the ride"" and is only seeing the forces from its own inertia.

Does that make sense to anyone else?  Keeping the trusting to a minimum would save weight and simplify design, but I don't want to trash axle housings either. ",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/1xzf99/off_road_axle_truss_design_question/

As of now, the entirety of our car is pretty much figured out, including stopping mechanism, power source, and structural components. The main problem, though, is nobody on the team has a firm understanding of mechanical design and thus acquiring motors to achieve our goal is proving difficult. I have some specifications that are unfortunately more ball park than experimentally determined, but I was hoping somebody could help me understand this more.

The variables that make this difficult are the distance and a payload that are provided on the day of competition. We are also constrained for time, so it should move fairly fast. 

At its heaviest, our car would be **10 pounds (~4.5 kg)**. This is likely an overestimation, but in any case, it is better to be on the conservative side. The furthest distance required would likely be 60 meters, so we were **desiring a speed of at least 0.6-1.0 m/s**. We have a **battery** that **provides at most 7.5 volts**, dispersed amongst an LED display for power output (we have the option of limiting power output from the battery), a stirring mechanism which mixes our chemicals, and a photo-resister which detects change in light transmission. The current draw could be an issue as we can't afford to recharge our battery to full after each run. Drag and wind resistance is likely negligible.

I got the basic design from [here](http://hackaday.com/2013/08/04/measuring-tiny-current-with-high-resolution/). I am using identical components. Unfortunately the measurement on the oscilloscope has a terrible rise and fall time that I can't seem to get rid of. I can't figure out where it is coming from. My guess is something has a lot of capacitance but the only capacitors I have are filtering caps and a little bit from the breadboard, but I don't think that would cause it. I've checked and the DC/DC is working fine, I've removed the filter caps, replaced all the parts, I've done everything I can think of to trouble shoot and nothing even effects it. Is it an issue of the circuit design in general? 

[Here is an album showing the waveform, the circuit, the diagram, and the breakout board for the AD8428.

Edit: Oh the waveform should be measuring the current of the msp430 going through a timer loop where it is stuck in a multiplication loop while driving one LED, then 2 LEDs, then 3, then LPM0, then LPM3, then repeat, so I would expect the edges to be very sharp.

The idea is to get to the top of the tube and literally jump into it and free fall to the 'bottom'.  The bottom of the tube would be curved such that the rider would end up decelerating as the angle of the tube increased (so the bottom of the tube is more like a giant slide).

73,How far above the Earth does an object need to be to take advantage of the 'sling shot effect'?,1392306492,"I was told that a 1,000 pound object with a net thrust of 500 pounds could cut it's engine off at about 14,500 miles into the sky and then use the sling shot effect to get to the moon (about 284,000 miles away) with no additional fuel usage.

I can't verify it because I don't know nor did I do the calculations to come up with this answer, an aeronautical engineer from reddit did the calculations and explanation and it sounded great to me.

Later, upon trying to learn more about this effect I was met with a lot of harsh skepticism and flat denial (from reddit member) of the smallest bit of credibility to the statement.

I haven't been able to get a hold of the person who did the formulas... so I decided to investigate on my own.  

First, I looked up where 14.5k miles is above the earth.  

Please look at the map on the page in the link below, but first I will tell you that the Galileo satellite is pretty close to 14.5K miles in the sky.  So, look for the light blue circle halfway between the earth and the farthest satellite orbit on that map.

Now, please tell me if you (aeronautical engineer or not) feel that an object could take advantage of the sling shot effect at that height ... or not?  What do you think?

79,I have a question about 12v capacitor/battery hybrid systems.,1392282733,"Let's say you're wiring up two 12v batteries in parallel for a truck, and you have a bank of capacitors which are capable of starting the truck's engine, which you want to wire up in place of one of the batteries.  You know that capacitors are more durable than batteries, so you want to connect the capacitor bank such that it is supplying the maximum possible current during starting so that your battery is used less and therefore lasts longer.  Essentially, you want to reduce the current draw from the battery as much as possible.  Would putting the capacitor bank closer to the starter in a parallel circuit increase the percentage of total current that the capacitor bank is supplying (relative to the battery), thus making the battery last longer?  Or would the difference between wiring the capacitor bank closer to the starter vs as far away from the starter as possible be negligible?  It seems to me that the difference wouldn't be that great.  

Alternatively, is there any way to significantly reduce the current draw on the battery that doesn't require a relay or controller of some kind?

85,What does the terminal housing? inside my well control pump do if anything.,1392256355,"The only two things inside of my controller box are a capacitor and a plastic block you plug the capacitor into (besides wires and connection terminals). Is it just a terminal block? or is there something inside that could fail.

1 HP in ground pump 145 feet deep
200 gallon galvonized water tank, bladderless.

History: Ran for 7 years issue free, The pump would trip the 220 volt circuit breaker occasionally. Resetting the cb got it going. Weeks between with no problems. Eventually the cb would not reset. Bought a capacitor from the company that installed the pump, it was smaller in diameter, seemed to fix the problem for a few days then it started again. Ordered a capacitor from BMI (same as original) when it came it was same size (diameter) as original. No joy.

The way I understand it there is a two speed motor that kicks on, like a first and second speed. seems to me when the motor is trying to move to second phase is when the breaker is kicking. 

I had the company come out and quote me $400 for control box/pressure switch replacement. I don't have it. Found out about the capacitor going bad so I went that route. The pressure switch isnt coming into play whatsoever, its tripping the breaker before pressure builds up. Water does surge when pump originally powered up, you can hear it in the tank.

Tomorrow I will test the motor myself. I assume they tested it but will double check. If it is a second phase burnt out in the motor can I simply disable that line to keep second phase from kicking in until I can replace it?

What decides how much voltage is put out from the generators/alternators at a power plant? What decides how much current is put out? I figure the two main variables are speed at which it spins and size of the windings.

Now, it goes through a number of steps before it gets to your house. I understand *how* transformers step down or step up voltage, but what decides how much current it can pass? Does that have to do with the gauge?

Now we have 120vAC at the plugs in our houses. I have a couple of small plug-in transformers. Lets say they are all 12vDC. I know the ratio of the number of windings is what steps it down and I know diodes convert it from AC to DC, but what decides if it is a 1,000mA or a 2,000mA transformer? Is it, again, just the gauge of the windings that matter before it burns up?

Last, onto alternators for cars. I know it goes much deeper than this with voltage regulators and all, but what about it is designed to output 12-14 volts? What if it spins faster? Slower? How would the size of the windings affect the output?

10,"for Structural Engineers, determining load capacity of the ""roof"" of a structure",1392152018,"I work for a company that builds large automation machines for textile manufacturing, and we've recently had some of our work practices come into question for safety concerns.  Specifically, we have to walk on top of the machine to install various components, and some of our customers are no longer comfortable with this.  The machine's framework is built out of 2"" stainless steel channel-bars, and it is craned into place on installation.  Surely, if it's capable of supporting its own weight dangling from a crane by a couple eyerings, then it can support the weight of a person and some tools.  But how can I prove this?  Is there a formula, calculation, or set of references I can use to show that there is a 0% chance of this thing collapsing under the weight of a person?

18,Lying about drafting capabilities? Self teaching solidworks (or any 3d package)?,1392132079,"Hi All,

I'm 24 and currently pretty unhappy with my job of 2 yrs as a project engineer in the power industry, and have been looking for openings around me. I strongly believe that, while I am learning an OK amount about system design and laying out projects, my work day is 99% dominated by instrument data sheets, reviewing vendor documentation, and updating pages upon pages of valve, instrument, and equipment lists.  I feel like all i'm getting trained to do is paperwork, and that is NOT what I wanted when I decided to pursue engineering.

To date, I've done almost NO real engineering -- no calculations, no drafting, no nothing.  The closest I get to drafting is telling the drafters what I want to see.  The closest I get to designing is telling the design engineers a handful of system parameters.  My work, though monotonous is so plentiful that I can't even shadow other dept. guys or try to learn a new skill for fear of falling behind in my work.  I work ~50 a week as is.

I have found a few leads that look very exciting, but all are looking for qualifications or industry experience I don't necessarily have, such as R&amp;D/design work, manufacturing experience, etc...but Then there's drafting.  How flexible are companies typically willing to be on 3d modeling ""experienced""?  I've used 3d before in school, got all A's, but then lost all familiarity with it upon graduating.  My skills have significantly atrophied and I'm afraid it will prevent me from getting a job.  Do I apply with subpar skills and hope I can fake it till I make it? tell them I'm a bit rusty?

Say I want to self teach SolidWorks, do any of you have experience with a good method for doing so?  I was thinking I may set aside an hour of my free time before or after work every other day and try to learn enough solid works to be able to work proficiently in it, and maybe even give me a good jump start on learning another package.

first off, i dont have much of a clue with engineering. most of the things i make at work are from engineering drawings. when its for me i just make stuff thats vaguely sensible/logical then overengineer it to be sure. this is slightly more potentially hazardous than things i usually make for me though

[i need to make a mezzanine for a personal workshop](http://imgur.com/a/Gq0JI) im putting together. it'll be used to store engines and transmissions, allowing 400kg or so for each engine and 100kg for each transmission (exaggerated). 2500kg SWL or so

columns are 150UC24, beam is 310UB32, and on top is a length of 150UC24 with a girder trolley and a chain block hanging off that (hoist load wont be over 500kg). the UC used as a beam for the trolley will be held up with 100UC15

bolted connections will be standard M20's, all welds will be 8mm fillet, for the UB lengths that have bolted connections the beam's flanges will be FSBW to flange plate and 8mm all round

load will be lifted from the ground up to mezzanine level then moved over the mezzanine floor then down. each load will have a suitable dolly/trolley to make use of adjacent space. hoist frame will have bolted connections to the mezzanine. the beam for the girder trolley will be bolted underneath its support the frame at the front

i'm ignoring guard rails for now, they'll be very simple to add on later. i need clear access underneath the mezzanine and the position of the floor is only slightly adjustable, the free area around the hoist will be shared. the mez floor will likely be 10mm steel sheet. the mezzanine will be on 150mm/25MPa/F82reo concrete, i havent decided on concrete anchors yet but likely one M20/8.8 trubolt per leg just cos ive got a big box full of them from work

 You might say: Golly gee. That's so simple, my 6th grade brother can do that. Just hook up the resistor to a DMM, and put it in ""Measure DC resistance mode."" The thing is, the DMM I'm using (Agilent 34401A or equivalent) does the darndest thing. [The test current changes depending on your resistance value.

And then take the voltage difference V_ab at the ends of the resistor?

And if you're asking: why don't you just try it?

I'm making hand-held signs with white LEDs in them. The signs are supposed to be black letters with ""stars"" on them (that's where the LEDs come in). I have around 200 white LEDs with these specs:

* Max Current: 20mA
* Forward Voltage: 3.0 - 3.4
* Max Reverse Current: 10mA
* Power Angle (deg): 160 - 180
* MCD: 16000 - 20000

I need to power the signs on one 9V battery each. My plan going in to this project was to wire the LEDs in parallel arrangements of 3 LEDs in series, to have a voltage drop of 3V across each LED. I would use some 220ohm resistors in series with the battery to dim the LEDs appropriately. Each sign will have either 15 or 18 LEDs total. I tried it out last night, and it looked like this: http://imgur.com/XGxX1Qe

I did more research today and found that LEDs in parallel are notorious for this behavior, due to minute differences in dynamic resistance. I looked into the possibility of getting a bunch of LM317's to use as current regulators but I'm new to those and I'm not sure if they would work for my needs. So to summarize, is there anything I can do to make the brightness more uniform on these signs? Keeping in mind that I'm constrained to: 

* 9V power source
* The LEDs listed above
* any other cheap components like a LM317 that I can get quickly on eBay

And obviously the simpler the wiring, the better as it can be hard to keep track of all these LEDs! I really appreciate any help I can get!

What I'm guessing is that transmission is long distance (turbine to city, let's say) and distribution is what provides the power from the point where it enters the city up to individual homes and businesses.
However, I just have this vague definition in my head.

So how would an electrical engineer define the difference between t &amp; d? Can you generally say that transmission must be over X amount of volts or Y amount of distance, otherwise it is just distribution?

Bonus question: What challenges are unique to electrical engineers in creating transmission networks compared with distribution networks?

    ------------------------------------------------------------

I was directed here by /r/learnprogramming. If /r/AskEngineers is not a proper place to ask this, then may I please receive a good redirect?

Thank you! Now on to my question....

I have a few functions in my calculator, and I have a basic understanding of programing structure. (If...else, for, while, lists, etc.)

I have two functions in particular that I need to have looked at:

    :multeval(function,varlist)
    :Func
    :Local answer:function→answer
    :Local var
    :
    :Local i
    :For i,1,dim(varlist)
    :
    :varlist[i]→var
    :answer|var→answer
    :
    :EndFor
    :
    :Return answer
    :
    :EndFunc

and

    :mesolve(function,variable,varlist)
    :Func
    :
    :multeval(function,varlist)→function
    :
    :Return cSolve(function,variable)
    :
    :EndFunc

The point of multeval() is so that something can be evaluated with more than one variable at a time on one line. Ex:

    multeval(x^2+y^2,{x=1,y=2})
    5
This is what indeed happens.


The point of mesolve() is to use a solving function while needing to evaluate for several variables. Ex:

    mesolve(x^2+y+cos(t)+z=90,x,{t=π,y=9,z=1})
    x=-9 or x=9
This is what indeed happens.

However, when having the function solve a **system**, it does not function correctly. Here is an example of what I **want** to happen:

    mesolve({x^2+y+cos(t)+z=90,x=y},{x,y},{t=π,z=1})
    x=-10 and y = -10 or x=9 and y=9


Here is what actually happens:

    mesolve({x^2+y+cos(t)+z=90,x=y},{x,y},{t=π,z=1})
    Error: Argument must be a variable name

It seems that the error is in the variable part of the cSolve function when transmitting the {x,y} to *variable* to the argument. I have tried many different things, all to no avail. To show that my concept works, here is the same function ran in two lines:

    multeval({x^2+y+cos(t)+z=90,x=y},{t=π,z=1})
    {x^2+y=90,x=y}
     
    cSolve(ans(1),{x,y})
    x=-10 and y = -10 or x=9 and y=9",AskEngineers,datachange,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1xh58n/ti89_basic_need_help_debugging_userdefined/
53,Help needed: Carbon fiber tubing truss desk (x-post /r/IndustrialDesign,1391990474,"I am a visual fx artist who moves every 12-18 months on average to a new city or country. I have progressively been making my collection of belongings more and more compact and portable to prevent repurchasing in every new country I move to. One item I HATE having to rebuy is a desk, so I started considering a portable solution.

Basically I saw this: http://dragonplate.com/carbon-fiber-truss/furniture.jpg and decided that it would be awseome to create something similar that I could move from city to city in something effectively the size of a tent bag - with the main surface EITHER being the only purchase consideration in a new city (a slab of wood or glass), OR developing interlocking plates, no wider than a foot each, that can also go into the bag, that create the main desk surface.
This would be pretty straight-forward to design if it weren't for the fact that the guys at that particular carbon fiber place said that the joints needed to be bonded with special glue for the structural integrity of the trusses. 

Does anyone out there have any special knowledge of carbon fiber that could tell me to get the same structural strength from a more 'deconstructable' design? Is carbon fiber the smartest material?

67,Construction Project Engineer Question,1391898532,"Hello, I have a few questions concerning being an engineer in a construction company. I recently had a phone interview with such a company, and I will be having an in-house interview next week. But I've been thinking about it, and I'm not fully sure if it's what I should be getting into.

A bit of background: I graduated with a BS in Civil Engineering about a year ago. I originally wanted to do Geotechnical Engineering, but it seems way too difficult to break into, especially without a Masters Degree. So I became a field/lab tech, hoping that would help me get somewhere. And I learned a little about construction, but I was laid off after the 90 day eval-period. They said I was more fit for office work than physical labor. So here I am, applying for something that seems to have actual office work.

In the initial interview, the project manager said I'd be out in the field a majority of the year. But I'm not sure what that would entail: He only said that I'd be talking to Superintendents and acting as a liaison between him and the higher-ups out on the work site. Would a job like this involve large amounts of physical labor, or am I more like a guiding hand to the workers? It's not that I don't want to get my hands dirty -- That's certainly not a problem for me -- but I don't want a repeat of my last job happening and them not thinking i'm suitable for the position after a couple months.

Another concern that was raised in my mind: What's the upward progression of the job like? What do I become in a few years down the road, and what would I ultimately become?  I'm not 100% sure, but it didn't seem like the project manager I talked to had his P.E.  (at least, it wasn't mentioned on LinkedIn). Is this not a true engineering position then? And would I be able to perhaps switch into design somewhere down the line after gaining experience in construction management? I've heard it's valuable experience that not many Civil Engineers end up gaining, but I'm not sure if that's true.

Not with today's tech, but would it be possible to make a mag-lev train track stretching from America's East Coast to the United Kingdom or France. The train in my head would have two lanes each way, east and west. They elevation of these rails would be on pylons that are high enough so that most any ship can past under them. Where the trains operate you have weather shields made out of Carbyne to protect the trains from the hellish weather of the oceans. Ran through the platform under the track is fiber cables or faster equivalent since this in the future.

1.  How can I lock the wooden flywheel to the shaft?  Is there some fitting I can use?  Is it enough to try to compress/pinch the disk between two locking shaft collars?

I enjoy what I do, really like my company and have always had the 'I'll get an MBA in the future' route in my head.

Well, that opportunity is probably now. I'm in discussion with my company to sponsor an MBA degree and there's a good chance that I'll get it. There are many upsides and reasons why to do it. Higher ceiling, diversification of degrees, easier to transfer industries. I think I'd be a good leader and while I enjoy the technical side of my position, I'm not completely enthralled with it like I read in some threads on here. I don't want to do the same old 'examine customers needs, plan design, complete design, troubleshoot, next order' forever. I dont want to plateau in my 40's like what often happens. So management is something I think I'd like to do.

The only holdup for me is that once this decision is made, it's probably permanent. A company isn't gonna want to pay 5 figures for a degree and 3 years later, you say, ""Yea, it's OK but I'd rather go back to what I'm doing."" They're gonna want a ROI and to use you for those positions. It's just kinda scary to leave the one thing I've done for the last 6 years probably permanently.

""The project will attempt to set a Guinness World Record with the largest continuous concrete pour ever, Martin said. More than 2,100 truckloads will deliver 21,200 cubic yards of concrete weighing 82 million pounds.""
""Pouring the massive amount of concrete at once allows workers to save several weeks' time over a more normal, slower pour, Martin said, and will yield one solid, connected foundation rather than requiring mechanical connections between sections.""
""But pouring so much concrete at once has its downsides, mainly heat created by chemical reactions inherent to the process. To keep the concrete from overheating, which could cause the concrete to crack and ruin, workers have installed 19 miles of refrigeration piping amid the foundation's steel reinforcement that will cool the process.""

The footing will be at least 18 feet thick.

     My feeling is that with a civil degree I could possibly still get the same jobs as someone with an environmental engineering degree, and fall back on a job that's not quite what I'm looking for to get more experience if I have to. My question is: what's the market like right now for someone with a degree in Environmental Engineering? Are there related fields with jobs not being taken into account by the BLS that would make my chances of finding a job greater? Will a civil degree offer me the same opportunities as an environmental? Money isn’t a huge concern for me, I’d be happy starting at around 45K with the potential to earn around 70K+ after gaining more experience. Thanks for any help.

Would it be feasible to provide the heat required by the ignition stage using concentrated sunlight instead of by burning fuel?  You'd have to (1) direct the sunlight onto the correct part of the turbine, presumably with good radial symmetry, and (2) ensure the heat would be conducted efficiently into the air flowing through the ""ignition"" stage.  

I wouldn't expect this to be practical for generating thrust - ie in an aircraft - because of the large array of mirrors required.  But could it work in a stationary installation - driving an electricity generator, for example?

So a quick question. I am an Entrepreneur, and I was wondering what is your opinion if someone built a business out of creating software that follows ASME/ASTM pipe construction codes, and provides an output of possible solutions to the Engineer.

I think this has two advantages:

1) It standardizes the interpretation of code
2) It makes the life of an engineer easier

For example, (let's just pick an easy one). An engineer wants to calculate the thickness of pipe under a certain pressure. He inputs a few parameters, and gets the resulting thickness.

This makes it so the calculations are less error prone, and reliable.

I do realize that it is very vague as of right now. But what is your thought on this? As well, what improvements/directions should I be looking at?

Edit1: pipe stress was just an example. I could do something like it and I would be looking to develop it as an excel add on rather than an AutoCAD add on.

I have been approached with the task of coming up with a concept for a motorized door to a large old hanger. Professionally I am a civil engineer so have not done power/torque calculations for a while. My role is to do some basic research and calculations to see approximately what size machinery would be needed and how much it would cost.  

The aim is to move the door weighing 25 tonnes with a single motorized wheel connected to a motor/gear box drive train. There are other options, but as this is nice and simple it is a good place to start. 

Am I correct that the torque required at the wheel is t=F*r, with the force being mass x gravity and r being the wheel radius. With F=250kN and r=210mm I get 52200 N.m. This seems like an awful lot, and that is not taking into account coefficients of friction/ rolling resistance or efficiency loss. 

A big constraint is to minimise the equipment size to preferably a 420mm by 420mm square (through section), longitudinally the length is not a constraint. 

I am looking at a 3 Phase AC motor connected to a bevel (helical or planitary gear box) with a chain/belt drive to the wheel with a further gear reduction. 

I am having trouble finding a system to get the appropriate gear reduction required, I have estimated 1:5 at the wheel and 1:100 in the gearbox. Input power is at 60hz, and 220/460V and output speed at the wheel is 3 rpm.

49,Limiting Factors for CPU frequency scaling,1391578375,"I was reading two articles today, one talking about how frequency scaling is limited by power consumption:

http://www.technologyreview.com/view/421186/why-cpus-arent-getting-any-faster/

Today’s CPUs have megahertz to burn but are throttled by the amount of heat that the system can pull out. Reduce the CPU power by 10% and you can push the clock speed up to compensate, turning power into performance gains. Most CPU design teams are now more focused on the power budget than on the timing budget.


And another article talking about how the number of gates effectively increases CPU scaling (indirectly via an increase in pipelines causes more expensive branch mispredict):

http://www.ecs.umass.edu/ece/koren/ece568/papers/Pentium4.pdf under Clock Rate section

Processor microarchitectures can be pipelined to different
degrees. The degree of pipelining is a microarchitectural
decision. The final frequency of a specific processor
pipeline on a given silicon process technology depends
heavily on how deeply the processor is pipelined. When
designing a new processor, a key design decision is the
target design frequency of operation. The frequency
target determines how many gates of logic can be
included per pipeline stage in the design. This then helps
determine how many pipeline stages there are in the
machine. 


So my question is are modern CPU clocks limited by the increase in logic ( timing limits, propagation delays due to more silicon and pipeline stages) or are they limited by the increased power dissipation in smaller transistors (leakage currents, gate tunnelling etc). More specifically, which of these two (or both or neither) will determine what frequency a modern processor will be set to when it is shipped?",AskEngineers,CountTwo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1x23v0/limiting_factors_for_cpu_frequency_scaling/

58,"Question about employee reviews, promotions and opportunities within a company.",1391558019,"I'm 22, working for my first job at an MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection) firm in Manhattan. I graduated last May with a BSEE and started work in June, we're about a 300-person company. 

From what I can tell our company has the following hierarchy for engineers:

President

Exec VP

VP 

Senior Associate - Project manager

Associate

Engineer V, IV, III, II, I


So over the past month many of my co-workers and managers who have been there for  3-10 years have gotten promotions. My boss was a Senior associate, now a VP, two other senior associates the same thing happened to, three associates got promoted to senior associates, a few of my engineer friends 3-6 years in were promoted to associates. 


I have not had a review on the other hand but I asked my boss how I'm doing and if I would get one he kind of trailed off as to why I haven't gotten one yet but told me that I'm doing a great job - I'm designing full buildings on my own, from schematic design to design development to GMP and 100% CD sets.  Many of the Exec VPs are impressed with my work.


Typically, is there room for me to grow at this company? there is a large contingency of engineers who are 3-10 years older than I am and they are getting promoted.  


I'm not looking to get promoted right now! but in your experience with companies like these, what happens? it seems to me like many positions that are ""higher"" in the company are being filled and I am just too young to have missed out on the opportunity window by a few years and won't get a chance because these positions are filled.

59,"Mechanical Engineers, what would be the simplest most inexpensive way to build a 'geared frame'?",1391557070,"Hello, 

can anyone help a non-engineer, who doesn't know where to begin, get an idea of how to build the geared frame described below and answer the following questions?  

""1""  Where would I buy the parts?  
""2""  Can I use materials that are readily available to complete this frame?  
""3""  How much would it cost to have a metal-shop craft this for me?

""4""  Can a beginner like me build this geared frame myself?

What I mean by a 'geared frame' is a frame that can support springs that exert a maximum force of 42 tons.  The frame needs gears attached to it.  The gears will turn when the springs are compressed.  

A hydraulic actuator with a 50 ton lift and a stroke distance of .63 inch will be mounted on the opposite side of the frame and will be used to compresses the springs.

The springs have a maximum deflection of .5 inch.   

The springs take up an area of 13 inches wide by 13 inches long by 5 inches deep.

I need 1000 fold reduction in force.  

I have already ordered the springs and the hydraulics, but everything else I will need.  Gears, metal, etc.

The hydraulic actuator is about 3 or 4 inches tall.

68,Demagnetizing the cores of an electric motor,1391526535,"I'm working on a scientific instrument which relies on an electric motor to rotate things.  The motor consists of two windings (primary and secondary), each of which has four coils.  If you were looking down into the motor, then the primary winding would have coils at north, west, south, and east.  The secondary winding would have coils at the ordinal directions.  Normally, the motor operates with the primary and secondary windings running on an AC signal, 90 degrees out of phase.

Here's the not so fun part - over the years, the iron cores of each coil have become slightly magnetized.  Not very much - the highest reading is about 3 Gauss, but since the machine would ordinarily be operating at about 25 Gauss, it makes a significant difference.

For various reasons, the motor would be difficult to replace or reassemble after taking apart (i.e., it would be hard to replace the cores and re-wind it).  The guy who built the system 25-odd years ago left patchy notes and has no recollection of where he obtained the original motor.

I'd like to try and demagnetize the motor.  I can heat it up to a certain extent, but certainly not to the Curie temperature.  There's a layer of what looks like cork inside, which is probably the limiting factor in terms of heating.  I can run an AC signal through the windings at varying frequencies, but I'm not sure that this will do very much.  I may be able to subject it to a large, varying external magnetic field, but I don't currently have access to that kind of equipment.

In calculating my system curve however, I find that the pressure losses are drastic at the outlet of the system. For example at a flow rate of 30,000 m3/h, I calculate the following losses:

@ Shroud inlet:                15 Pa

@ Shroud section 1:         0.2 Pa

@ Shroud contraction:      30 Pa

@ Shroud section 2:         10 Pa

@ Shroud outlet:              1730 Pa 

The large losses at the outlet will significantly lower the operating point of the fan and hence lower the wind speed achieved at the outlet. Is there any way of reducing these losses?

I used [this](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/minor-loss-air-ducts-fittings-d_208.html) source to calculate my losses, so basically the equation at the outlet is given by:

Pressure Loss = ε*(1/2)*ρ*v^2

ε = 1 (Flow from duct to room)
ρ = 1.275 kg/m3 (air density)

So the only way I can see of reducing the losses is to decrease the velocity which defeats the whole purpose (I want high velocities). Is there any other way?

What are some of the dangers, here? Obviously molten wax and plastic are plenty dangerous all by themselves, with plenty of potential for bad burns. But should I be worried about toxicity? 

Eitherway, ""The Plan"" is

1. Get some kind of deep fryer or similar device that has temperature control.

2. Kitchen thermometer

3. Add paraffin

4. Heat until the paraffin melts, usually around 160f I believe.

5. Add plastic

6. Heat until the plastic melts, which will vary depending on what kind of plastic I end up with. Paraffin lights at something like 400, so the goal is to keep it well under that.
 
5. Stir gentle until plastic flakes or chunks have melted. 

6. cast the liquid wax into blocks for carving

7. Set the blocks aside to cool. 

8. Don't die in a horrible wax related incident.

I'm trying to show the usefulness of springs as an energy storage device.

To do this, I am in the middle of designing and building a device (something like a go-kart or bicycle) that uses springs in place of a hydraulic accumulator (for instance) to store energy that the device can use to travel short distances on spring/hydraulic
power alone.  It can also be pedaled.

When 'braking' the device uses its kinetic energy to (ultimately)
re-compress the spring.  I'm making it regenerative so I can squeeze every bit of usefulness from those springs.

Question:  What is the simplest possible hydraulic system I can put into the device to accomplish what I described above?

I've already designed the springs and spring-frame for the device.  The springs are arranged in such a way that they produce about 6,654 foot pounds of force (just under 40 tons) at their max deflection of one and a half inches.  

Besides the springs being re-compressed during the braking of the

39,Why is the integral controller integrated from t = 0?,1391112974,"Looking at the equation for I in PID: http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/9/d593c27abdc1aecffb56d06d2a9ba8e3.png

Doesn't that mean that if you had to ramp far from initial value to set point, that gigantic error area will permanently affect the ability of proportional controller as due to P and D controls it won't deviate from set point thus not giving it enough time to bring accumulated error to 0?

In other words, if I turned on PID controller to get me to 100C from 22C, and it took forever to ramp up and eventually stabilized at 100C set point, how can it do that when the total error value used in the proportional control math should be gigantic and it will never accumulate enough error in opposite direction from set point to bring it back to 0. How is it even useful then? Is it constantly fighting against P and D controllers?

41,Making a pasteurization coil for a lab out of copper tubing,1391100677,"Hi engineers. Biologist here.  I hope perhaps you can help me.  I have a bit of a calculation challenge for anyone interested.  

I run a small food applications lab.  Recently we acquired a homogenizer to work dairy applications and i need to pasteurize right after homogenization to simulate best what happens in a real dairy processing plant.  So far i've only homogenized and then taken it to a beaker and heated it, but it's impractical and prone to overheating, spills, etc, which makes my error bars be larger than the the page.

I can't buy a pasteurizer because they're supremely expensive and huge, while my lab is small, and i can't buy a coil already made because i'm in venezuela and this country sucks you can't ever find anything here so you have to make your own.  I don't know if this is even practical so I'd very much like your imput to determine if this is feasible.

So here it goes.  I've got a length of ASTM L type 1/4'' copper tubing.  The liquid dairy leaves the homogenizer at a rate of about 4mL/s but it can be increased to 8mL/s or decreased to even 1mL/s, depending on how fast i set the rate of input at the feed.

Pasteurization ought to be to so the liquid spends at least 16 seconds at 72°C.  The tube ideally goes into a water or oil bath at 72°C for this to happen.  I need to know the length of tube that i need to set as a coil that has to be be immersed in the liquid to have the dairy product reach 72°C and spend 16s at it.

The dairy products are not meant to be consumed, only to be analyzed, so i am not at all worried about the effect of copper on milk.

Feel free to ask whatever other information you might need, i'll be monitoring closely.   Much obliged :)

82,"Can anyone explain how ""beamforming"" works with high end Wi-Fi routers?",1390881340,"I recently started looking at wireless routers and saw how some of the higher end ones offer ""beamforming"" which claims to find the relative position of devices and somehow concentrate the signal it is producing in that direction. [(Basic explanation from pcworld)](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2061907/all-about-beamforming-the-faster-wi-fi-you-didnt-know-you-needed.html)

I understand how the router could possibly find the device's location with triangulation, but I don't see how you can dynamically concentrate the signal in a specific direction without a ton of moving parts to make something along the lines of a rotating radar dish for directing the signal.

Does anyone know (or have any ideas) how this works? I can't find anything that explains the technology behind it any more than saying that it directs the signal, but not how it does so.

Edit:
Ok, I think I understand now thanks to you all how positive interference is being utilized to increase the signal strength specifically where the device is. But like most explanations, this raises more questions than answers ;)

1. Is there anything to help the router ""hear"" the device in a similar manner? If not, this seems kind of like a hoax because the device will show a stronger signal strength, but the range won't actually be extended significantly because the limit will still be where the device's signal becomes too weak to be received by the router.

2. ~~Also, what is the advantage, if any, of setting up this interference pattern? That is to say, why setup an array controlled by a processor that has to manage the location of each connected device, instead of going the more obvious route and just setting up a more powerful transmitter.~~ Obviously this would be so that your signal doesn't pollute the neighborhood etc. while giving a stronger signal throughout the area you actually want it in.

3. In your all's opinion is this a valuable addition as it stands to a router, or is it just smoke and mirrors. (Like monster audio cables having gold contacts, in theory it is better but in practice it doesn't make an almost indiscernible difference.)

84,Work done by an expanding gas,1390876854,"Okay, here's one for the thermal fluids people

Today in an engineering thermodynamics lecture, the professor gave an example of a gas doing work. We had a cylinder full of helium at a pressure of something like 200 kPa absolute and the valve was opened so that the gas would flow out against the atmospheric pressure until the pressures were equal. Also the cylinder was assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings so the temperature of the gas was equal to the temperature of the ambient air. However, the way he calculated the work perturbed me. He said that this was an isobaric process because the gas was expanding against a constant atmospheric pressure. I was under the assumption that an isobaric process means that the working fluid stays at constant pressure throughout the process which is not the case in this expansion. And in this case, the gas pressure is dropping as it leaves the cylinder.

The professor then proceeded to calculate the work as W=P_atm*ΔV. But I didn't think that was right and that simple.

I should also note that the system was modeled as a closed system, so the gas inside the cylinder and the escaping gas were the system.

If this is not an isobaric process why is the work calculated with a constant pressure?

Am I correct, or is the professor?

edit: The way I see it, the work transfer is driven by a difference in pressures, and as such a pressure difference should show up in calculating the work, leading to an integral form as necessary.

19,Need help with a turntable transformer? Possibly?,1390674238,"Hey everyone,

I've got an ancient listening-room style record player that I am having some trouble with.  The caps in it went bad, and so I replaced them.  Easy enough.  Now, however, the transformer in it has started giving me really inaccurate readings, and it's getting worringly hot and smells and sounds like it's ready to explode. I'm also not getting any sound out of either the speaker or headphone jack, but that's currently a backseat problem.  I'm including an imgur album ( http://imgur.com/a/mr3lK ).

I've done readings with a multimeter, and gotten some odd readings that seem to vary depending on...nothing? Maybe? 

If I read from D3/4 anode to chassis ground, I get 2VAC/20VAC respectively.  I tried swapping the diodes (D3 to D4 and D4 to D3), and this didn't effect the readings.  Still 2VAC/20VAC.

If I lift out the diodes and read from either secondary lead to central tap, I read right around 26-27VAC.  

The first time I measured from + to - of C15, I read around 60mV DC. The second time, I watched it climb up to and level out at 34V DC.  Since then, I've only gotten it to read 60mV.

I can only assume that given the record player's age, the transformer has gone bad.  I'd pop it out and order a new one, except that I can't find anything on the internet concerning the record player (model 2150), the company that made it (Audio Visual Instruments out of Wood Dale, Illinois, or the transformer model (18-452-606-0-04).  The transformer has no ratings on it at all, but I *think* that what I'm looking for is as follows:
117/120VAC Primary, 50VAC Secondary 2A with a Central Tap. I'm getting the 2A from the circuit breaker fuse in the lower drawing,

I'm also multiplying the velocity by (1 - exp(-t/tau)), where tau is the mechanical time constant of the system, to take into account the time it takes the motor to come up to speed due to inertia and other motor properties.

Now, the interesting part. Decreasing the step size of my simulation (decreasing t) does not lead to a converging solution. There is an increase of lag in the velocity of the motor with decreasing step size. I'm calculating velocity with:

[V(t) = (V(t-1) + ((A(t-1)+A(t-2))/2) * stepSize)*(1 - exp(-t/tau))
Note: I use A(t-2) because A(t) is a function of V(t)

I have a bit of an odd one... I'm trying to work out the minimum thickness of ice that it would take to block a 1"" diameter pipe containing ~100psig of air pressure. The incoming side would be 100psig and the outgoing side would be 0psig, ie: at the maximum pressure differential for that system.

I remember reading a long time ago that you only needed a 1/8"" bridge of ice to block 100psi of air pressure but I'm having a hard time trying to prove that is the case, and also trying to find at what internal pipe diameter this holds true for.

It's related to refrigerated air dryers freezing compressed air pipes in pneumatic air systems during fault conditions.

1) What type of brackets, rods, etc., could I use to make this cantilever mechanism? I don't know what any of them are technically named, nor where to get them. Preferably the ones shown here:

4) Is there any other mechanism that I could easily make, or buy (cheaply) the hardware for, to simply make a table top rise about 15 inches and have good stability and weight-loading capacity?

For starters, I've purchased one of these 
http://www.amazon.com/Peak-PKC0AY-02-Mobile-Power-Outlet/dp/B003TCVGYU 

power inverters at a pawn shop a few weeks ago. For use in a car. We've had it connected straight to the car's battery with the chassis for ground and gauge 4 wire for positive. It's worked great for many weeks on a wide variety of equipment up to 750 watts.

One day, after unplugging an appliance (the appliance was 600 watts), it suddenly blew it's fuse. I opened it up and replaced it and it blows immediately again when I connect it, even when it's turned off. It just blows the fuse immediately without any LED's turning on, no beeps or anything. 

The inside of the inverter has three transformers, one 40A fuse on each. 120A total. Only two of three fuses are blowing.. the last one isn't. When i connect power, nothing happens. (I can take detailed pictures if it's helpful.)

I've taken the board completely out of the case and tried powering it that way, to make sure nothing inside is shorting.. Nope. Later i've checked everything very closely to make sure nothing fell in.. There's nothing. Finally I decided ""fuck it"" and I jumped the fuses with a solid piece of metal, and connected it with jumper cables to a 850 CA car battery.

Pretty big sparks fly when I connect it, but once I do the voltage drops in much the same way it used to drop whenever the inverter was pulling about 800 watts of load.

I've noticed that two of three of the internal power transformers are warming up, but I didnt leave it for more than 2 seconds.

My guess is that the isolating enamel in the transformers got damaged somewhere... but is that even possible without any physical movement or overloading? The inverter is rated for 1200 watts continuous and It was only running 800 watts before I unplugged the appliance.

It's pretty expensive and I'm not prepared to just throw it away. I'd like to repair it by all means possible.

58,Leaving before a year...,1390415811,"Hey everyone, I'm not sure if this is quite the right spot, but I thought I'd give it a go.

I graduated last May as a MechE dying to get into the aerospace industry. I had relevant experience, ambition, passion... but none of that could overcome the effects of the sequester (which seriously hampered my job search). 

After a few months, I ended up taking a job in another industry doing something I found a bit interesting, but was/am not very excited about. I don't find my current career challenging. I feel that the more time I spend here, the more decreased the skillset I want will become despite my skillset expanding in a position that I'm not excited about.

I found a company nearby that has an opening for something I'd like to do far more. I just wanted to ask for some advice on leaving so early. I haven't been with this company for even a year at this point. How would leaving affect my reputation within the job market?

59,Help on what would be required for an idea to be feasible.,1390410963,"Basically I need help on what would all be involved for an idea I gave my girlfriend to pitch to her marketing class to be actually  do-able in the real world. The idea is developing a cell phone app that would allow car users to not only keep track of regular maintenance (oil changes, tire rotations, fluid flushes, etc.), but also act as a kind of wireless ODB2 sensor to let the user know when something is wrong with their car that requires attention, such as a bad valve, gasket, or a profound leak of sorts. The only issue I can imagine in my head is that since there is already a port for an ODB2 sensor to be plugged into, is there a way to develop some software for the vehicle to go ahead and transmit what's wrong with the car to a mobile device, or would there need to be some external hardware that would have a bluetooth sending and receiving unit built in to make it usable?

Like I said, it was just an idea, but from what else was pitched in her group, this sounds like the best idea, in my opinion.

To be quite honest even if there were, I would be bored after a year.

- I also enjoyed learning about inventors Roentgen, Edison, and most importantly **Nikola Tesla.**




My questions are this

- **Which sub specialty has the most design implemented?** 

*Not industrial design.* That's not solid enough for me

- **Which sub specialty has the best job outlook?**

I know there is a lot of overlap in the fields so I've considered majoring MechE and minor EE but I'm unsure what that would do for me.

62,Looking for ideas on securing an airfoil to a shaft.,1390372494,"To be brief, I have an airfoil that must be temporarily secured to a 1"" shaft so as to prevent as much rotational movement as possible. I was considering the use of two machinable shaft collars with two custom holes. One hole for the 1"" shaft, and the other for a small diameter dowel to be slotted through the core of the airfoil, say 1/4"". The issue I perceive with this is flexing of the dowel, and thus unwanted rotational movement. Should I be concerned with this? 

If I were to up the dowel size though, I'd also have to up the collar size from a min - max ID of 5/8"" - 1 9/16"" to 3/4"" - 2"". At this point, the OD of the collar would change from 2 1/2"" to 3 1/4"", and I wouldn't feel very comfortable using such a collar size. There would probably be too much of an obstruction to the flow to justify the implementation of the airfoil (the whole point is to decrease the wake coming off the shaft).

70,"Chemical EIT (Junior) here! About to enter the work force full-time since graduating, but am at a difficult crossroads...",1390332236,"Hello Engineers!

I am a Chemcial Engineer in Training who graduated from UAlberta '12. I had been working with my last Co-op position since graduation (City of Edmonton) up until Dec 2013. I have been looking for full-time positions since (and before) graduating (City could not keep my permanently).

On Jan 10th (Friday), I had an interview with a industrial specialty chemical supply company (thermal and cold oil extraction, water treatment, etc) in Lloydminster (live in Edmonton). The position was a  chemical sales position working in an area of the company that primarily focused on the thermal oil extraction process side with existing contracts with Husky. With new thermal projects within Husky coming up in the area (this company covers everywhere along the border from Conklin and Fort Mac, AB to Kindersley, SK), the chance to make big commission on these new projects (as their sale rep) is definitely there. The position comes with a company truck that can be used for personal use, cellphone, compensation for moving, benefits, 15 holidays per year. The downside being:

- the move itself and all the costs involved (somewhat closer to her family, same distance from mine, but gone from pretty much all friends)

- the fact that AHS (my wife is a LPN in Alberta) does not run in Lloyds hospital (have to change to Sask License $$$) and the hospital has no positions

- Lloyd is a growing pains city, and not the Edmonton kind, I mean full of oil workers, temp residents, country redneck trouble attitude (trust me, i grew up in the area) and lots of motels/hotels. Similiar to a smaller Fort Mac or what Kindersley (that horrible town) is going through

- the position would essentially be 24 h on call. I have heard horror stories of guys getting on salary job's in these sales positions.

- the position is unsure or slow in getting P.Eng status (need to check with APEGA). Have been informed that will probably be making more than a P.Eng by that time (prob true), but also know that career paths in technical vs. sales do not really converge often (i.e. the farther you go down one, the more you are committed)

I have received the offer letter from said company. They offer $72,000 in base salary with a 15% yearly bonus, 15 days vacation per year, and not much else in the letter itself. They are wanting to fill the position within the end of the month, and have a 48 h offer window.

My crossroads is that 10 minutes after hearing on that Monday about the potential offer from Lloyd, I get a call from Biggest-Gas-Company-In-Alberta in Edmonton, saying hey had received my resume through Jason (works there; dating my cousin) and they would like me to come in to interview for their rotational EIT program yesterday (Jan 20th). The interview went well, and they said they would call about a second interview if they are interested. I like that it is in Edmonton, and a office based, technical job (downtown). Able to grow through a role I am much more comfortable with (technical vs sales), and that is close to home and familiar, as well as safer job security wise. They will most likely not be able to match the compensation salary wise, but all the personal and lifestyle benefits are there (not on call, normal hours, working in downtown edmonton, close to home, no move, no shitty city, no looking for a home)

My crossroads is that I would like to be able to find out whether or not my application pans out with the gas company, but I don't want to throw a potentially lucrative offer on the table just to have time to hear back from something that might not pan out.

The thought of applying makes me nervous because while on paper, I'm very qualified for this position, and my resume practically matches their job description,  I have a lot of personal work to do to bring myself back up to speed. 

 The posting has been up for over a month now, so they may not have found anyone qualified yet. My question is, should I/how should I discuss this in the cover letter? Do I want to disclose that I am actively relearning this material. I'm just afraid that without telling them, they will give me a technical interview, which would be not only a waste of time for both parties, but also unnecessarily embarrassing for me.

Maybe putting this another way, if you were reviewing applications for a position, how would you respond to a candidate that used to do precisely what you are looking for, but now needs to relearn it?

I am in a class called Energy Conversion (similar to Thermodynamics II) and struggling with a problem:

A food processor has a cutting/mixing blade driven by a 0.25 hp electric motor. The machine is initially filled with 1.0 quart of water at 60F 14.7psia. It is then turned on at full speed for 10 minutes. Assuming the entire machine is insulated and the mixing takes place at constant temperature, determine the temperature of the water when the machine is turned off.

Do I treat the food processor as a closed system? If so, W = 0 because of constant volume. I have access to steam tables, but have no idea where to go from here.
If I could get a good direction on what to know, that'd be extremely helpful, thanks!

6,"Looking to become an engineering, looking for some advice and answers from engineers.",1390159706,"Hello all,

My name is James and I'm strongly looking into becoming an engineer.  More specifically a Computer Engineer.  The majority of my questions are geared towards a Computer engineering standpoint.

Here's a little info on my current situation.  I'm 23 years old, a SSgt in the USAF and am active duty stationed at NAS Fort Worth JRB (Carswell AFB).  I am a 2W0X1 (Munitions Systems).  I'm married, and also a home owner so I do have financial responsibilities that still need to be met while I'm going about this endeavor.  I'm hoping to not have to reenlist when my contract comes due, which is in March 2015.  I may be able to work the system and get an extension, but I want to move on with my life before I end up being in for 8 years and having to walk away from the military after all of that time, but I am definitely realistic about it.  My recent decision has been made because of the way the Military has changed gears in the way they're doing things and I'm just having a harder and harder time following along with it.  It has nothing to do with anything political, more so how everyone is/is going to be treated.  That's a totally different story though.

I have always had an interest in computers and soft/hardware but haven't really explored beyond a ""beginner"" level because I'm afraid to ruin something...  I have always loved to learn new things, which is why I feel like this is an exciting adventure for me.  If anybody has any websites or any other information for someone who is looking into learning how to write code and do other applicable tasks for computer engineering, I would greatly appreciate if you would share them so I can take a gander at them.

I haven't begun any schooling for engineering as of yet but have been working diligently and have gotten in contact with my local university with an accredited engineering program (University of Texas Arlington).  My current plan is to use my MilTA, along with my GI bill if necessary, to begin as much of the schooling portion, online, for my general ed requirements as possible.  The reason behind this is because, with my busy work schedule and not being able to really pick what shift I'm on to accommodate my schooling, I want to get as much of the schooling taken care of as possible so that I can minimize my down time of not having a job and being in school.  

How many engineering students got a job in their field (either part time or full time) while they were still in school, under an internship?  

How is the quality of life for a computer engineer?  (More so geared towards how is the pay if that's not too personal for you...)  I'm not doing this job for the money, seeing as I make pretty good money doing what I do now.  I bring home about 53k/yr with all inclusive benefits and retirement etc.  That's with no degree, straight out of highschool and less than 5 years in the military.  That, however, changes based on duty station as my housing allowance plays a large role in that as well.

Have any of you guys been in a similar situation as mine, and how did you proceed?

For computer engineering, what classes would you recommend to take/not take that are actually worth while?  

What kind of programs are good to participate/lead in?  I think my military experience may help with this as I've done quite a bit of ""leading"" in my short time in, so I've got good experience doing that.


I really do appreciate all the help that anybody is willing to give as I'm extremely excited to do this but also very nervous as this is a huge change for my family and I.  Thanks for taking a look at this!

James",AskEngineers,Sh3itskees,/r/AskEngineers/comments/1vm018/looking_to_become_an_engineering_looking_for_some/

The bag deforms and absorbs some energy that way. We thought of using a non-deformable object, but no one wants to punch something that hard with all they got.
The only solution we have so far is to put a dozen or so accelerometers all over the bag and try to map the inputs to some common axis and sum them all up.

I'm working a heater fire case, in the investigation phase.  One of the things we have discovered is that it appears that the electrical connections were substandard.  We purchased 7 identical heaters, made close in time to our subject heater, ran them, and 6 of them showed ""browning"" at the connections, or even melting and scorching.  We have engineers working on the case and they have come up with opinions.  I was hoping some engineers might be able to confirm our thoughts...

Which method is the safest way to make an electrical connection in a 1500 watt consumer space heater:

1.  Twisting then crimping by hand

2.  Twisting then crimping with a machine

3.  Dipping in a hot solder pot, then hand crimping a cap on top

4.  Dipping in hot solder pot, the machine crimping

5.  Another method 

Thank you in advance for any replies.  I'm especially hoping that some engineers who have been involved in the design and manufacturing of small consumer appliances can hop in because our engineers are not experienced in the manufacturing side.  

There are millions of these heaters out there and we are of the opinion that they will all eventually fail in a way that is potentially catastrophic.

the aerodynamic load bearing, structural, and thermal

Fahrenheit. Key design requirements included flying 100
missions with minimal refurbishment, maintaining the aluminum
wing structure at less than 350 degrees Fahrenheit,
withstanding a **kinetic energy impact of 0.006 foot-pounds**,

That's about 0.008 joules if i'm interpreting correctly. Surely it can't mean that a 10 gram object going barely 5 km/h could break the edge of the wing... right?

Finally, .008 joules applied on a large surface obviously isn't as damaging as a small rock carrying the same energy.

30,Help with circuit! (passive high-pass circuit problems),1389998920,"I'm attempting to input a heart rate signal into my iPhone via the microphone jack. I need to pass the signal through a [passive high-pass filter](http://puu.sh/6ouqg.png) to remove the DC offset before inputting it in to the iPhone.

At first, I tried to use a passive high-pass filter with a 1uF capacitor and a 100k Ohm resistor, since I needed the cutoff frequency to be very low. The signal I measured matched my heartbeat.

Graph 1: [Circuit 1 Signal out](http://puu.sh/6otrl.png)

It turns out, however, that the iPhone checks for a ""microphone"" via impedance matching; the circuit must have a resistance of ~1k Ohm for the iPhone to detect a microphone. Given this, I made what I thought to be a high-pass filter equivalent to my previous one, except with a 100uF capacitor and a 1k resistor. According to the math, they should behave the same.

The signal I measured instead had very large magnitude spikes that were periodic but not in time (by any ratio) with my heartbeat.

Graph 2: [Circuit 2 Signal out](http://puu.sh/6ovtw)

**These data were acquired when the circuit was not connected to the iPhone, see notes for details**

What might be the reason for this behavior? And are there any suggestions for achieving the behavior I want with a ~1k Ohm resistor ? I'd greatly appreciate any help!

Notes:

1) For data acquisition, I am collecting the data via an Arduino Uno. The x-axis of the graphs represent the sample number, and the samples are collected every 2ms. The analog input of the Arduino reads a voltage between 0-5V, and converts it into an integer from 0 to 1023.

2) The Arduino isn't the most accurate method of data acquisition, but it's very cost-efficient and should be good enough for these purposes.

3) The iPhone mic input might have an internal high-pass filter of ~30Hz, so this might all be a moot point, but I am still curious why I would get this behavior.

If you look at the page [here](http://www.frostytech.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=2697) you can see that the waterblock is  30x30mm.

Since my Pelt is larger than the cooled area on my heat sink I Need a hotplate aka heat spreader. 

I am using Copper (110) as my heat spreader, I just need to figure out the proper thickness. 

If you have a really thick piece of copper you will loose heat transfer through conductance but will gain spreading resistance as it will lower. Too Thin and then it will have a higher resistance for heat spreading.   So I am trying to find the ideal thickness. 

Ive been told I could use Fluent for this but I do not know how to use it.

Particularly on how to use a user-defined function as an input?,1389977798,"I need to simulate a turn-on turn-off sequence of a heater in order to see the temperature rise and decay as a function of time. I made a smooth piecewise function that represents my on and off switching. I put the name of said function on the current field and upon trying to solve for this time-dependent study I get an error:

Failed to evaluate variable Jacobian.
	- Variable: myfunc2
	- Global scope

The time range on my function and my solver and the function are the same, and I've played around with the stepping and smoothing options of the function but still the same problem. 

**Edit:** I found out what I was doing wrong. I defined correctly my function and everything, it's just that when you go and put the name of the function into your input, for instance I had to put ""myfunc"" into the terminal node in comsol, you actually have to put it as ""myfunc(t)"" (without quotations of course) to specify that it's a function of time.

I thought that since I had already assigned units to my function when I defined it that comsol would understand that but that's not the case. I am very annoyed at the lack of examples and documentation on this matter as I feel that this very important ability of using functions as inputs is crucial for simulating more realistic scenarios and I could not find a decent tutorial that would explain these syntax rules that had me waste a lot of time.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/1vgguo/anyone_here_familiar_with_comsol_particularly_on/

I'm just starting my second year of electromechanical engineering, and those ""free energy/perpetual motion"" machines fascinate me, not because of their titles, I know energy can't be created. I just think they're very clever.

Last semester, our electromagnetism teacher asked us to do whatever we wanted for our final project, as long as it was interesting, and I built a Calloway Magnetic V-track device similar to this one (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX7XIazh6iM)

I thought of adding some coils for them to be induced since the magnetic fields are moving, and maybe blink some LED's just to make it look fun, but I was overwhelmed with homework.
This semester I'm going to try and adapt it to be an eolic generator, but honestly I didn't pay much attention when we got to electromagnetic inducing so I'm not sure if I'm just gonna waste my time.


TL;DR

My question to you is: How practical would it be to produce electricity with a machine like this and some wind for energy input? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX7XIazh6iM

We're used to using primary power from the grid, with redundancy including backup UPS and diesel generators. With the cost of natural gas decreasing so much and expected to keep decreasing, we were looking to switch to a few natural gas turbines (for redundancy).

We're going to be building a new building in the next few years on the order of ~15 MegaWatts but were looking for ALL sizes of gas turbines because anything extra we would try to dump back into the grid if it makes sense. After doing a lot of research there are many variables that will affect the size of this plant... there could be regeneration, inter-cooling, reheat, combined cycle (steam turbine), absorption chiller or not, etc. 

Recently I visited the General Electric plant and was able to see their LMS100 turbine with inter-cooling that produces 100MW of power.. As you can see from [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/uAQtDaq.jpg), that it's approximately 158'x105' for a simple cycle generator with inter-cooling...those cooling towers at the top seem to be out of the way due to an existing cooling loop.. that structure also has a generator connected to it and all the supporting infrastructure that goes with it.

This is literally the only reference of a turbine powerplant that I have...

51,Increasing the pressure in a horseshoe boiler,1389896438,"I'm working with a small, horse-shoe shaped boiler which sits at the lowest point of my system.  Cold water is fed into one side of the boiler through a 1-way valve where it sits until the boiler does its job, generating a pressure head which then expels boiling water out of the exit side.  This works fine and expels 100C water.

I'm investigating increasing this temperature by increasing the pressure on the exit side of the boiler via diameter reductions in the piping.  As pressure increases, the boiling point of the water will increase and I'll generate a 110C, 120C flow.  What I can't wrap my head around is how to calculate how much pressure I'd generate through reductions in diameter.

Classically, a reduction in diameter will increase fluid velocity via conservation of momentum.  Where fluid velocity increases, pressure actually decreases.  Practically, that's not what's happening.

Rather than guess-and-check by reducing my 9mm ID tubing to 7mm, 6, 5, 4, 3, I'd like to be able to model this system and what kind of pressure gains I can expect at each level.  The vapor pressure of water is already towards the asymptotic part of its curve at atmospheric pressure so gains will be capped, but even increasing to 150 kPa, 200 kPa would give me a 10C, 18C gain respectively.

I was planning on controlling this with a simple 2way  push button.

Mister manager asked me to not install the electrical part of the project, as since we were not planning on using any limits or plc control, he had another idea. He said there are ""pneumatic levers or switches"" that I could use at the point of use to allow an operator to control the valve.

Hello! I certainly hope I found the right sub for this question. I've spent the last hour searching for the most appropriate one to fire this one away. I can't find many resources for this, so thanks in advance for any advice.

My father and I, while work is slow, build things in the shop. And once a year or so, we build a massive or overdesigned BBQ pit ;) We are currently adding some thought to this one. I will get some pictures put up tomorrow of it, and see if I can also find some of the others we've done in the past that lead parades (we're in TX hehe)

**First, the far-off objective** (In hopes of robbing more of your attention up front):

What I'd like to do is have a small steam engine powering an alternator (with battery bank) for lights, rotisserie, and other things 12v using the heat from within this large pit. It may be mounted on a trailer, and powering all kinds of stuff.  I have some basic principles on the design part, but may need help with the technical aspect. Aesthetics is probably the primary goal, but functionality follows a quick second. (I may need to make a new Question when I get to this?..) I think this is gold bearing :P

**But, currently I'm stuck and need advice with this:** 

  The rotisserie design. I may need some advice on what to use for gears and motor and where to get them. Here's a (sorry) [drawing](http://imgur.com/RC8bkk3) of what's going on here. It's five spits, with 73mm sprockets expected to have up to 40 lbs on each. I understand the loading of the motor would be harshly affected by an off-centered, (delicious) 40lb prime rib falling on every turn. That said, I realize the spits should be chained up in staggered directions to help counter this. In the above quick 'n' dirty drawing I sent my dad, I was thinking of using a (12v*) drill with a large reduction gear and extending the actuator control up front.  *Motor now likely to be mounted below the pit. 

  Variable speed would be nice but not necessary. Preferably 12 volts and quiet. Would something like [this motor](http://www.ebay.com/itm/GW31ZY-DC12V-1-7A-14rpm-Turbine-worm-gear-motor-Caterpillar-drive-Stepping-Motor-/261210374980)(not a stepping but curious about power ratings) be ok with, say, a 4:1 reduction -Something along those lines? I didn't want the motor to be too loud, considering there may also be a small steam engine in here soon. I also figured the gearing would help reduce the feedback on the motor from the falling corpses. Heat isn't as big of a problem because we have the entire ""oven"" built with two layers of sheet steal (double insulated) with some high temp insulation between (Dad's doings)

  There's another aspect to this pit that I'd like to add, and it's hot water. But I don't want to overwhelm anyone including myself just yet.

72,HVAC design engineer looking for answers,1389756703,"First, a little background: I've been in the consulting engineering field for almost four years.  The majority of my first two years was spent designing plumbing and electrical system for various building applications, but my primary focus for the past year and change has been HVAC design in buildings.  I'm a degreed mechanical engineer and I've passed the Fundamentals of Engineering exam.  I plan on taking the Professional Engineering exam in October of this year.

I'm loosing my mind.  Every single day is another deadline.  Remember that feeling in college during midterms or finals?  When your internal engine seemed to be operating at a higher RPM compared to the rest of the semester...Well, that's how I feel every day.  As soon as I meet a deadline, a brand new one is waiting around the corner.  I can't breathe.  I can't relax.

I do enjoy what I do.  My fiancé throws food at me when she catches me gazing up at the ceilings during our dates.  It's happened on more than one occasion.  (I'm adding this little bit of information so that you know that I don't hate my engineering.  I really do enjoy designing HVAC systems, but something has to change.)

I'm trying to put words to the things I hate about my job.  I hate crazy deadlines.  I hate feeling rushed.  I hate being disrespected as a junior engineer who's expected to perform as quickly as a senior engineer.  I hate having questions that need answers with no time to research those answers myself, or having someone readily available to help me answer them.  

I hate that engineering has become fast food.  A client asks for a 'number 1' and I'm supposed to sit in front my computer for countless hours dreaming up the cheapest, quickest possible avenue to permits.

I've tried to determine what exactly it would take for me to be happy: maybe if I was in control of my deadlines (to a reasonable extent).  If I could tell the client when my work will be done.  If I could tell my manager when I'm not comfortable working on another project until the projects already on my desk are complete (without being made to feel terrible afterwards).

Sometimes I wish I could just work on enough projects to make the money I need and then stop.  Maybe work from home at my own pace.

I need help finding answers to basic questions.  Unfortunately, I have no one in my life to ask these questions to.  I can't talk to anyone at my firm because I'm afraid the wrong person will get wind of my concerns and I'll lose my job.  I need help Reddit.  Please help me.

Am I in the wrong business?  Are crazy deadlines normal at EVERY consulting firm?  Are there other HVAC design engineering positions available where I can still design, but I won't have to deal with crazy deadlines / cheap clients / greedy bosses?

I'm at this point in my life where I feel like time is the most important asset I have.  My time on this planet is finite.  Everyone, regardless of money, has a finite amount of time.  I spend countless hours sitting in an office with miserable people, talking about how much we hate our miserable projects, all while stressing out over unrealistic deadlines.  

Is this what I what I spent four years in college for? 

I spend more hours awake with the people in my office than I do with my friends and family.  Why can't it be better than this?

Help.

tl;dr - I'm an engineer in a funk.  I'm not happy.  I need advice from other engineers who may have gone through something like this before.

83,Advice on building interactive demo modeling conversion &amp; transfer of energy.,1389713063,"I'm planning on building a hands on model to be displayed in a national laboratory along with several other interactive demos, similar to what you might find in a children's science museum. 

The general idea is that it will be a Rube Goldberg machine where the user inputs one form of energy (possibly a hand crank to charge a capacitor bank or hand driven pump to drive water to an elevated storage tank). From there, the initial energy input will be converted and transferred through various forms using motors, generators, water turbines, LEDs paired with a solar cell, etc...

Obviously energy losses are going to be a problem and the order in which the sections are arranged should take into account the loses of each section. If this was a kit I would have absolutely no trouble building it and explaining the function and science behind each section. I'm fairly mechanically and electronically inclined but I could use some advice on spec'ing out the components. Suggestions on component ratings, possible sources (motor from RC car, pump from fish tank), and expected losses would be very helpful in designing.

84,Source for energy absorbers?,1389713021,"OK, folks.  Ya know those energy absorbtion devices seen on the back of fall arrest harnesses?  The ones that provide roughly 900 lbf of arresting force while playing out in a controlled manner so as to stop some poor sap from falling while not breaking his back?  Yeah, those.

Anyone know of a source for such that are capable of stopping much faster objects?  Ideally, it'd be able to stop 100 pounds moving at about 150 mph.  I don't need quite that level of performance (want vs. need and all that), but the off the shelf fall arresting gear types are in the noise level for my energy requirements.

Unfortunately, it can't be too expensive.  If it's not an off the shelf part, I'm sure I can't afford it.

87,Suggestion: Guidelines for Questions,1389707258,"The majority of questions that I see on here tend to be very general without giving any specifications. For example: the post about making a moving mouth for an art installation ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1v6jez/how_to_make_a_moving_mouth_for_a_art_installation/)). Most questions, like this one, leave out most of the information needed to solve the problem. This leads to a waiting period between the question being asked, the inevitable ""we need more information"" comment, and the response from the OP. I think that a quick and simple fix for this problem would be to provide guidelines, or ""suggestions,"" for users to follow when they want to ask a question that could be linked to in the sidebar. For example, the post I referenced before would have been much more informative if it went like this:

""Hi, I'm an artist looking to make an a moving face installation. The face's mouth needs to move up and down at a fixed constant speed, opening between X-Y times a minute. The face, seen from the front, will look like it's coming out of the side of the wall. I'm making the face out of X material, and the bottom and top lip weigh Y pounds. The face is X feet long, Y feet tall, and Z feet wide. The lips are X feet long, Y feet tall, and Z feet wide. I'd like to keep the project under $Z.""

Here's an example of what the guidelines should look like:

""**Hello, welcome to r/AskEngineers! We're here to solve your problems, but first, some suggestions to get you better answers faster:** 

1) **Provide details.** Any details that would be pertinent to solving your problem. Answer questions like: How big is it? What does it need to do? How heavy is it? What is it made out of? Where does it need to go?

2) **Provide limitations and conditions.** Where is it going to go? What kind of environment is it going to be in? Any special considerations?

3) **Provide a *specific* budget.** ""Cheap"" or ""relatively inexpensive"" could mean anything to us. Some of us work for companies where ""cheap"" means under $100,000. A specific dollar amount would be appreciated.

4) **If you don't know what you're talking about, don't try to sound like you do.** It's okay, we're used to it. If you don't know where to start on something, ask for suggestions on where to start.

**Here's an example of a bad question:**

I want to build a tree house in my backyard for my kids. I know about trusses and stuff, but I'm just wondering what the best way to hold it up would be. I'd like it to be cheap. A slide would be cool.

**Here's the same question, but this time it follows these helpful suggestions:**

Hello, r/AskEngineers. I'm looking to build a tree house in my backyard for my kids. I'd like to build it in between these three branches (this would be a great place for a picture) of this sturdy oak tree, which are relatively level. The usable area on each of the branches is about 3 feet for each, and they are all about 10 inches in diameter. The branches I'd like to build it on are 6 feet off the ground. I'd like for the floor of the tree house to be 5'x5', and the roof to be 6' tall so I can play in it too. I'd also like to build a slide that they can use to get down, but I'm not sure how to make that fit into the design. My budget for the project is $450, but any suggestions on how to make it cheaper would be greatly appreciated.

90,"How would I start about building a mechanical, MP3 controlled instrument?",1389691750,"**Edit: Changed mp3 to midi. silly typo.**

Naturally, I would start out small and simplistic to become familiar with the concept, but the end goal would to be able to connect my PC to several mechanical instruments that would play in accordance with an midi file. The simplest execution would be perhaps a bell with a mechanical hammer that strikes rhythmically when prompted by the midi file. A more complex idea might be a guitar with mechanical fingers preset to press down 3 or 4 different chords and a mechanical arm to strum it.

I'm willing to do the work and teach myself a lot, I just need a jumping off point to work with. Where should I look for materials? What are some good sources to learn more about the mechanics and programming involved?

Edit: I figured knowing the problem that this build would be a solution for might be relevant. I want to be able to write music in midi format and make it play automatically on real instruments like a robotic performance.

91,Young engineer with a good job and potential new offer. Thoughts?,1389684647,"I'm 25, a recent civil (transportation) engineering grad with a bachelor's and EIT. Interned at consulting firm for 9 months, applied for public sector job, got promoted at consulting firm before hearing from public sector. Last week I was suddenly asked to interview for the public sector, did well, and have 2nd interview this week. I'd like to prepare myself if things progress and I only have limited time to make a decision.

CURRENT, PRIVATE SECTOR:

* Small but nationally-known firm in a big city
* Really flexible schedule
* Traveling opportunities
* National/international projects
* Learning tremendously and respected by principals
* Intern for 9 months, now permanent for 3 months so far
* Only making $48k + ok benefits
* No chance of earning PE (we are an urban planning firm, and I am one of &lt;5 engineers out of 100+)

POTENTIAL, PUBLIC SECTOR:

* Small, tourist city with total staff of 3 engineers including me (can still live in big city)
* 9-5 schedule
* Local projects only, which seem interesting and I get to see them from start to end
* Don't know the current staff well
* Pays $69k + great benefits
* Can earn PE after 1.5 years

3) Car has an estimated stopping power modelled into the braking system where if the wheels stop too quickly it is assumed they are braking? This seems most likely but would vary based on what tires you have on or how many people in the vehicle.
