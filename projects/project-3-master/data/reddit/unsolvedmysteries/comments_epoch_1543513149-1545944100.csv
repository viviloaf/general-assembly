6,Mechanical Engineering Technology: am I sub-par?,1545935710,"Hey all. Got your attention, I hope. I've got a question for all the full mechanicals and mechanical technologists out there.

I'm currently studying MET at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology in Alberta, Canada. I love it. I had to upgrade my high school to get here (I was a journeyman auto mechanic prior to this career move), but my lowest upgrading mark was an 89, and so far it's been smooth sailing--I'm carrying a 4.0 from my first semester in the program.

Soon I'm going to have to declare my major. At SAIT (not sure if it's different in other tech schools), you have three options:

Design and Analysis
Design and Automation
Design and Development
I'm interested in both the Analysis and the Development streams. Analysis focuses on the hard maths (second-level thermo, machine dynamics, fluid mechanics, and mechanical systems), while Development focuses more on the product design career path (product development, Autodesk Inventor, product analysis, applied product development). The design aspects of the career interest me greatly: I actually decided to go back to school because I enjoyed working in Solidworks for my hobby 3D printer so much that I figured hey, why not do this instead of breaking my back for the rest of my life?

However, I live in the biggest oil &amp; gas city in Canada, in Calgary. From what I've picked up on here and there, it's going to open many more doors for me if I take the Analysis stream. I would, also, have the option of bridging to a university for a full degree in ME later, should I so choose (something that would be much less possible if I chose Development). I'm not sure that's something I want to do, I feel as if the ring and stamp are things I don't care too much about, but it's another unlocked door that Development doesn't have.

this is my first time on reddit so please be easy on me 🙂.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're short on time skip this bit:

I live in Germany and have a treadmill that my parents brought from America. It is quite old and there are no spare parts available in Europe. Since a few months it has been out of order because some bus voltage is too low (Error Code EPLO). Following the flow chart in the Manual it says to replace the VSD (big pcb with a lot of stuff on it). While it is possible to find some old refurbished VSDs in the US I don't feel like spending 1,500 $ one some old refurbished pub. However I really need a treadmill and since  it seems to be in good condition (except for this issue) I decided to just drive the motor separately. If anyone has safety concerns please state your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the important stuff:

On the Motor there is a plaque with this Data

I was fortunate to receive two job offers at the same week, where the other one was very much unexpected but offers great opportunities. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I am now in an unexpected dilemma. My undergrad internship is in small molecule pharmaceuticals so that is pretty much my background.

**Job Offer 1**: *Associate Manufacturing* at a biopharmaceutical CDMO (midsize local company)

\-I am under the impression that this is not an engineering position, sort of like an operator. Pay is lower by \~$6000 compared to #2 and in a slightly higher COL area which is also where I live. The thing is, I have targeted building a career in the biopharma industry but it's hard to find an engineer position unless I have an experience or a post-bachelor degree. The company has sold me that they have plenty of advancement opportunities within the company, but I took that with a grain of salt. But biopharma is a growing field and a stable industry(?)

**Job Offer 2**: *Field Service Engineer* at an auto assembly equipment supplier (midsize Japanese but has a small US presence)

\-This was the unexpected offer, with actual engineering duties but mostly deal with troubleshooting electromechanical equipment supplied to auto assembly plants. I don't mind traveling to different places, and even has a higher starting salary at a slightly lower COL area. The thing is, my electromechanical skills are very basic because we don't get much training in ChemE but the first year is pretty much all training and shadowing other FSEs. One thing I could see a benefit from this is the automation and controls knowledge I would gain (PLCs) which is also a growing field in engineering. I also don't see any much internal growth opportunity within the company, so I would eventually have to move to another company if I want to get a promotion.

25,Thinking out of the box for Massive Pumped Hydro Storage systems,1545876982,"Pumped hydro has the potential to become the primary backbone energy storage system for two reasons. First, pumped hydro has a relatively good round-trip efficiency of 70%-80%. Second, we may find the topography to store energy in the TWh scale if we think outside the box.

Pumped Hydro is an energy storage system that uses an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir to store energy. The amount of stored energy is measured by the volume of water in the upper reservoir. Water is released from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir to produce electricity. Water is pumped up from the lower reservoir to the higher reservoir to store energy. If the upper reservoir has no water, there is no stored energy. If the upper reservoir is full, the amount of stored energy is at maximum capacity. 

The topography to store a massive amount of energy may already exist if we think outside the box. Any two reservoirs that are near each other with an elevation difference could work for a pumped hydro system. The reservoirs can be at any location where fluids collect. As an example, we have been mining underground for decades. Are there salt caverns/caves that we can use as reservoirs? If there is no natural water source nearby, it may require pumping water to the site. Or are there places where we can modify the topography for two reservoirs?

I need to heat \~15ml saline inside a fluid goggle which is basically swimming goggles filled with saline and a lens mounted inside, it's used for freediving. To do this I need a heating element mounted on the outside of these swimming goggles, I also need to be able to adjust the temperature, the saline needs to be around 30-37 degrees celsius I think.

Here's the problem: I don't know what to use as a heating element, how big it needs to be and how much power and stuff it would consume, I also don't know what to supply and regulate the power with.

So far I've come up with a couple of ideas, I could use kapton heating film which looks like this: [https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1KiXwKVXXXXalXXXXq6xXFXXXg/35mmx90mm-12v-12w-PI-film-heating-film-polyimide-heater-heat-rubber-electric-element-heating-pan-Element.jpg](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1KiXwKVXXXXalXXXXq6xXFXXXg/35mmx90mm-12v-12w-PI-film-heating-film-polyimide-heater-heat-rubber-electric-element-heating-pan-Element.jpg)

Problem is it's very hard to find of the right size and power, not a lot of places sell it in small quantities.

So I thought maybe I could make my own heating element with nichrome wire, and just glue it on the goggles with silicone or something, I think this would be simpler than finding heating film to buy actually.

Still, I don't know what size nichrome, or how much power and stuff I should run through it, it's hard to figure out and I suck at math so if someone could help me figure it out that would be very appreciated.

I also don't know what to use for power regulation and supply, I don't need any sensors to keep the right temperature since I will be able to feel when the temperature is right with my skin, but I will need a way to control the heat somehow. Things I have considered using are: DC motor esc to control the power to the nichrome wire. Could work but what size?!

33,Will this civil career support me in the SF Bay Area?,1545859609," 

I am 27 and live in San Francisco. My family and friends are here. I have worked for 3 years, and will be obtaining my PE license soon. I make around $80k. I am hopeful that with my PE I can obtain a new job with a 15-20% increase. I feel stressed about the cost of living, and it feels like my career as a civil engineer will not support me financially.

I try not to compare myself to other people; but I have too many friends making near double my salary, and it is making me feel like I have basically two options; 1. Leave my family and friends and live elsewhere to buy a home and have a decent life, or 2. Switch to a more lucrative career.

I am not emotionally attached to Civil Engineering - I have not really enjoyed it that much. I am drawn to the perception of ""technical academic rigor"", but I am much more of a people person, and know my success and happiness will come from building relationships and ""selling"" rather than punching out calculations and reports.

I like that this career is giving back to the community and environment, but I don't feel like it is giving back to me, and I question if the rigor and push for licensing is really going to pay off long term.

I know that this is a regional cost of living problem, and it isn't unique to the Civil Engineering industry, but....what gives? I have been academically successful from a top university, I am a critical thinker, I work really well with people and an easy going person. It seems like I should be able to feel relatively financially comfortable as an engineer. I also have a lot of local, senior engineering connections from generations of family being here.

Has anybody come to this realization as well? Am I being completely off-base with my assessment of the industry? It seems that if I continue to ""climb"" the engineering consulting ladder, I can someday (if I am good enough) make $150k-$200k in the bay area - which is a wonderful salary almost anywhere in the world. I can make that work if I end up with a professional working partner. I am just worried it is going to take too long, and the cost of living is going to outpace my progression as an engineer.

First of all thank you for your time and patience reading my post, I do not take your patience for granted given the amount of questions like these. I am currently considering working in the US and here is my situation:

The reason: During my research MPhil in Hong Kong, I was in an amazing relationship with an American woman until she eventually went back to the US. In my tender age of 25, I never felt this happy and fulfilled when I was with her. I have multiple offers from jobs in Europe and HK however at this point I am willing to move to the US to be with her.

I know this could sound immature as hell but I have the necessity to hypothesize! And as such i need to know what chance I got to enter the US. By September 2019 I will be free. Which leads us to my profile.

My profile: I am a Portuguese national. Graduated from a top tier UK university in aerospace engineering and was valedictorian (if that matters for anything) and currently finishing my MPhil research at a top tier university in Asia. I also have worked for 14 months with General Electric (GE Aviation) and did pretty well.

I never considered the US before as it seemed near impossible to obtain a work visa. I don't have the necessity to restrict to aerospace and would not mind working in any engineering related field.

68,How to accommodate for vacuum pressure throwing off a sensor reading,1545692579,"Hello experts. I’m trying to smooth some data and I’m struggling with a certain issue, hoping you all can help. If a different subreddit would be better, please let me know. 

I’m using a pressure transducer to measure the pressure in a tank being carried by a vehicle. Think of a water truck. The liquid sloshing around while driving and taking corners creates a lot of bouncing data, but a moving average calms it down fairly well and results in a reliable data set for a gauge display. However, when the vehicle is traveling in a straight line on a highway or somewhere with constant speed, the moving average doesn’t work. Since the pressure is near constant (and higher due to a higher vacuum pull on the liquid) while driving at that constant rate, the moving average is inflated incorrectly. The tank will have around half pressure while driving around town, then I’ll get on the highway and it will climb up to reading full pressure, then I’ll get off the highway and it will go down to reading less than half pressure. So the full pressure reading is obviously incorrect. 

I’d love a software solution, but I’m thinking I may need a hardware solution to counteract this artificial inflation. Any thoughts would be fantastic. Thanks in advance. 

Tl;dr: Vacuum pressure pulling on a tank of liquid is higher when traveling at a higher speed, so it’s throwing off an in-line sensor reading.

Hi folks. Hoping some wiser people the me may be able to give some insight into a customer complaint! We are a bicycle shop and recently started to stock stock electric scooters. A customer has advised us that he was simply carrying his scooter and the handlebar completely severed suddenly and without cause(3.5 hours after leaving store).

We import these scooters, so are obviously concerned. We have an aluminium material test arranged for January 7th, but are hoping for any insight into situation before.

We believe something more dramatic may have happened to the scooter and customer is not telling full truth, but we wish to test material nonetheless and learn what happened. Customer let slip in conversation that he was on a bus before returning home. Our feeling is something may have happened here. I attached pictures of fracture of what appears to be a sudden brittle fracture.

Customer states he was simply carrying scooter and it simply snapped in his hand under no stress. Surely this would at least show a fatigue fracture? Also, have attached a picture of how product would be carried with fracture location circled. I do not think area of fracture is even under any pressure in general? Note that all weight is centered on opposite wheel where motor is enclosed.

Any insight into the nature of the fracture and likelihood of a material failure from such would be great appreciated. In mean time we have 8 scooters hanging from bike stands in held position for 24 hours to see if they fail!

72,[Structural Engineering] Can my stairs handle an 800-1000 lbs load?,1545683954,"I recently moved and I'm looking to purchase/move an 800-1000 lbs safe up a flight of 6 stairs. The stairs are made of wood (I don't know which kind). Will my stairs be able to support the weight? I have included a blueprint and pictures of the stairs. See: https://imgur.com/a/64krTX1

The stair measures 38.5”x12”x1”. The front has a 1 inch radius. The method of fastening the stairs to the staircase involves 2 blocks measuring approximately 10.375”x1.5”x1.5” (Length x Width x Height/Depth) attached to the staircase on each side with screws and then the stairs are placed on top. There's a spar running the length under the stair. This measures approximately 35.5”x1.75”x1.5”. However, the spar does not appear to be attached to the blocks that the stair sits on. In certain instances you can see light between the spar and the stair blocks. I believe the spar adds rigidity to the stair.

It's worth noting that there are round “knobs” on the stair blocks. I do not know if this is for decoration or part of securing the stair blocks to the stairs/staircase.

See the blueprint and pictures for more information: https://imgur.com/a/64krTX1

The safe's dimensions are 36""x25""x""60.5"" (Length x Width x Height).

Is this doable? Alternatively, if the stairs cannot handle this load, what's the max load that these stairs can theoretically handle?

83,"Feeling Discouraged, Nearing Job Search",1545636076,"Hi there. Wishing everyone safe and happy holidays. I am grateful for some words of wisdom or advice by peers or those settled in engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

**Details:**

I'm finishing up my master's in mechanical engineering in Canada. 

&amp;#x200B;

During my masters I had experience leading research, working on industrial projects, and also have side projects to show (both directly in and outside of mechanical engineering). This all ultimately pushed my thesis work to the side for a couple of years as I worked on these projects concurrently but I was happy to learn and explore a variety of fields and technical research.

&amp;#x200B;

During a small internship at a large company, I managed work which was subject to a patent and major ideas being generated for follow-on work. I was later contacted to join the company but ultimately after various negotiations, the salary I was offered was on the very low-end of the scale. In effect, aligning with a bachelors with less than 1 year of experience. Eventually those discussions fell apart. While I haven't formally started to apply, once again, I was contacted by an old internship workplace and received a salary offer around the same ballpark.

&amp;#x200B;

This had a bit of an impact on my perspective. I really felt companies that had seen potential would not try to low-ball. But perhaps my expectations have become skewed. In reflection, it seems that master's, regardless of the countless experience it comes with, is not considered very significant within Canada. I suppose I'm having trouble navigating if I'm really just an entry-level candidate at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

Do I just need to snap up the first low-ball opportunity that I get in my area? Should I pack up and go somewhere else? In general, it seems there is really not much variability in the engineering pay scale if cost of living are taken into account across the board and that always seems to dissuade me to look outside of my current city.

My answer as an engineering student is of course yes, the tree making an impact with the ground/other trees obviously generated sound (pressure) waves that propagated away from the event. And whether a person was there to hear it or not does not have an effect on this result. 

My friend went on to tell me that as an engineer/mathematician I of all people should understand that I cannot make this assumption.  Lol. 

My conclusion was that we were not talking about the same thing. I was thinking in terms of physics and he was on some other shit. He was using the definition of sound as the interaction between a sound wave and a detector, which is a fine definition of sound I guess. But why even ask the question if the definition of the word your using requires a detector and the question is asking about the event occurring with no detectors present? It’s like asking if the tree got applauded after it fell. Obviously not because there were no people to applaud.

After a year of this, one of the owners decided to get rid of the unproductive 40% after he realized the numbers keep getting bad and these people won't change.

However, he found a new developer from our area (we live in a small city) that currently freelances and he's pushing really hard to bring him on board. The idea is to cut some of the unproductive 40% to make room for him.

Everything would be fantastic except for the fact that this guy asked for essentially 150% of the salary every other dev/engineer (including myself) currently gets. The reason for this is that he's currently freelancing and he's used to a higher salary. Now my boss has already labeled him as a ""turbo programmer, genius developer and the key to make the quality jump from small company to a competitive company"".

I know this guy. I've seen his work. He's just a full-stack developer like me and another guy in the company. He's not special, he has no ""secret"" skills and no clients, but my boss already put him on a pedestal, and already told me and others that he's seriously evaluating ""giving him what he asks"" by firing others. I was sitting there, incredulous, trying to figure out his logic, until he said to me ""well.. he's like you but with 10 years more experience"".

His reputation is already that of a genius coder within our walls, and I know part of it is because he has a git hub account where he has written some code that nobody in the company understands so it seems ""he's amazing"".

And it did it for me. He's giving a total stranger everything he wants without any special skills and leaving me and others with the same skills on a lower level.

Am I wrong to feel like crap about this? Would this be an indication to jump ship?

**NOTE:** this is the second time something like this happens. One of the guys on the ""unproductive 40%"" joined our company two years ago and was given 20% more money than everyone else.

13,Need help approaching this heat transfer problem.,1545547771,"Hey guys. 

Currently I'm working on a problem involving the flow of cold air (-20°C) over an insulated pipeline through which heated oil flows. I know the temperature of the oil at the inlet and need to calculate its temperature before the next pumping station .

I assumed the outer surface temperature and calculated the outer convection coeffienct then I calculate the inner convection  coefficient (using an assumed mean temperature) .

Now I have the overall heat transfer coeffient and I thought about solving it as a heat exchanger problem but I can't figure out whether to assume the air temperature at -20°C to remain constant or not. 

If not I'll need to use the NTU method and to use it I'll need to know the mass flow rate of each fluid . 

I know the volumetric flow rate of the oil so it's not a problem but for the air I have no idea how to calculate it .

Should I use the frontal area of the pipe as the area used to calculate the mass flow rate of the air ?

14,Career Dilemma (Final Year EE Student) - Should I really be an Electrical Engineer if I don't like hands-on with electronics? or should I change my career to Software Engineer/Data Analyst?,1545547494,"Merry Christmas and Happy New Year fellow people,

&amp;#x200B;

Next year, I will be starting my 4th year EE in well-renowned engineering university in Australia. As the time will approach where I need to find a job soon, I have some dilemma whether I should really pursue a career in EE.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some background about me :

&amp;#x200B;

When I started university, I have always wanted to do engineering but I am not sure which kind of I want to do. Then, I found renewable energy is a very cool area to do hence I think doing Electrical Engineering would provide me with the skillset. I ended up not really liking the stuffs except for power system courses that they taught and I found that I am actually not a very hands-on person in terms of tinkering with electronics.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also not very good academically (had 70+ CR WAM or near 3.0 GPA), but I still persevere through all the courses (being agreeably the most difficult engineering degree compared to my other mates) though I can say I survive through rote memorization and not actually understanding the fundamentals.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be specialising in power engineering in my final year. While I still aspire to be an Electrical Engineer especially in Renewable Energy, I am just not sure whether I will thrive being a good engineer in this field who is actually clueless about Electromagnetism (I tried reviewing this topic but it just doesn't really stick) and doesn't really like being hands-on with electronics. I hate it when people expect me to know how to wire things on the panel while that's the job of an electrician! (people seems doesn't get this bit - it's the biggest misconception of being an Electrical Engineer! - plus I don't think I want to do that stuff)

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I have also developed an interest in high-level programming (found out I don't enjoy dealing with hardware level). Being a software engineer is actually one of the other degrees that I wanted to do before I started university. I have tried coding in C and actually like it though only being an average on it. I have chosen EE because I reason that I can always transfer to Software Engineering from EE but not the other way around. Looking at the jobs opportunity out there for software engineers are just insane, they have flexible hours, higher pay, better work culture, more reputable company and startups, cooler project, etc. compared to EE. Currently doing my EE internship at a power plant, but on the side, I am building my skills through online courses in Python, Tableau and AutoCAD. Because by the end of my degree (in a year), I want to equip myself with skills that are high on demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is I don't really know which direction should I steer myself at this point in my life. Ideally, I would love to have a career with the intersection of renewable energy and data analytics/software. But if that didn't work out, I think I would better align myself as a Software Engineer/Data Analyst rather than being an Electrical Engineer.

18,Advice on Moving from Australia to Europe for MSc then Work as a Graduate Electrical Engineer,1545534932,"Hi, I have recently graduated from a 4 year BEng (Electrical) in Australia, and am currently working full time. I am doing R&amp;D/product design ranging from electronics design to firmware, and I quite enjoy the work.

My goal within the next few years is to work in Europe (at least for a couple of years) before I get any real commitments in life that would make the move much more difficult. I think it would be hard to get a job over there on work experience alone (2 years part time while undergrad and 1 year full time as a graduate when I make the move), so I am considering doing a masters in Europe to act as a bridge into the labour market (as this is expected level of education for a graduate engineer over there). 

The problem is I think I will lose interest if I do a typical very theoretical masters, as I have always been a very practically oriented person. Are there electrical based masters out there that are more design or project based? I guess what I see my ideal career as is somewhere between electrical engineering and industrial design. I want to have high level input to the product design cycle, but also enjoy doing the lower level electronics/firmware work. 

So I guess my question is does anyone know of a masters in Europe that mirrors what I want to do in my career? Or is there a field that mirrors this that I can search for?

I would also appreciate if anyone has general advice about making the move / my current plan. Thanks.",AskEngineers,False,cengg,/r/AskEngineers/comments/a8rck9/advice_on_moving_from_australia_to_europe_for_msc/

27,Career advice - what am I?,1545497735,"Hello all,

First of all I'm sorry if this post doesn't comply with the rules, I've read the rules in r/engineering but ended up posting this here.


I am a mechanical engineer with master degree in automation / mechatronics.
In the last 3 years I've been working for a big automotive manufacturer, where I do the following:
- Consultancy for which lines can and should be automated (in my plant and in the other plants of the group);
- Project management for those said automations;
- Project design for the new changes;
- Chose and buy the materials needed (robots, aluminium profiles, sensors, PLCs, etc) ;
- Assemble everything and program everything (robots, plcs);
- Because I'm deeply buried into the IoT (internet of things), I also manage a Linux server from where I run every script (mostly python) that checks on all my robots / PLCs and dumps all the data in an oracle database that I also manage;
- I make my own asp .net websites that I use as HMI (human machine interface) so the managers can check whatever is happening in real time on all my applications;

Basically I do every project on my own since the concept phase until the integration in the lines.
I have all the time 2 interns that I can use to help me out, but I cannot rely on them to much because eventually they will be fired and 2 more will replace them.
I am doing super human work and not having enough help / pay raise so I decided to seek new jobs.

My situation is the following:
- if I search for ""mechanical engineer"" all the job offers are for CAD design.
- if I search for ""robotics engineer"" only appears RPA (robotic process automation)
- if I search for ""automation"" only appears RPA (again) but also software development.
- if I search for ""IoT"" only appears IT jobs.
- if I search for ""robotics"" only appears PLC programming.
- if I search for ""mechatronics"" sometimes I don't even get any result.

56,Current state of anti-drone technology?,1545409066,"The recent [drone shutdown of gatwick airport](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/world/europe/gatwick-airport-reopens-drone.html) has got a lot of people concerned. 

What is the current state of anti-drone technology?

There's going to be multiple approaches that can be taken.

-Frequency jamming
-GPS spoofing
-Physical takedown via defence drone
-Physical takedown via ground based projectile

It seems to be a difficult problem to address, as any defense solution could be overwhelmed by cheap multitudes of attacking drones. 

I'm not sure the current capabilities of frequency jamming, but it seems clear that a drone could operate autonomously without radio using preprogramed visual queues or other radio-free techniques. Is there any other methods such as a tightly focused EMP weapon that could fry the motor windings or computer circuitry directly?

If the drone is operating autonomously it also makes it harder to triangulate where the operator would be using radio signals. 

Even if you can disable a drone mid-air, there's the problem of dealing with the debris which could fall on sensitive areas, especially if the drone was equipped with explosives which could be designed to detonate if the drone is disabled or grounded.

Maybe suicidal kill-vehicle anti-drone drones to home in and destroy by impact followed by a net carrying drone equipped with liquid helium canisters to auto-inflate to keep the debris in the air if dangerous? 

Or perhaps (I'm being half facetious here) a special corps of AirPolice using [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFadyUqRKek) to get up there and use some means to disable them mid flight?

I'd love to know what you think about this emerging problem.",AskEngineers,False,yogononium,/r/AskEngineers/comments/a8bijj/current_state_of_antidrone_technology/

58,Are nonelectrical solid objects considered when sizing a room for air conditioning?,1545407216,"Note: I prefaced nonelectrical as electrical components, while taking space, also generate heat. So let’s take that out of the equation.  
Background: None.   


Assuming a **10 square meter room with 2.6m height equivalent to 260 cubic meters**, assume three objects exist and are placed on the edges of the room excluding the location of the entrance to the room, and the location where the air conditioner is:   
 

1.) A **1 cubic meter solid, not hollow, block** made of stone. The edges of the block are finely beveled, not a perfect square.   
2.) A **3.75 cubic meter bed that is 1.5m width, 2.5m length, 1.m height**. The mattress having 0.6m of that height and the box spring having 0.4m height. The box spring has no stand. The mattress is common, maybe something like [this](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00272208/).  
3.) A **4 cubic meter closed cabinet that is 1.2m width, 0.6m length, 1.4m height**, made of plywood having half its volume with clothing inside.  


If everything is solid and glued to the wall with no gaps that would be **8.75 cubic meter – 260 cubic meter = 251.25 cubic meters**, in theory anyway. But these are separate objects and not the wall itself.  


Wall insulation, ceiling insulation, and other variables accounted for, the btu that is needed to cool the room is **5000 btu/h**, not accounting the three objects. Would any of the three objects lessen the amount of btu required? And if it does, what are some other objects that are more effective?

73,"Need some major clarification on worm drives, torque ratios, and using manual power as a substitute to a small motor.",1545353297,"I'll get right to the point. I need to raise a load that is about 2000N. My plan is to use a worm drive that interfaces with a rack (as in rack &amp; pinion ""rack"") which is secured to the load.

&amp;#x200B;

If I have a 1N-m motor and a worm gear with 20 teeth (this will be a single start worm drive), then I should end up with a 20:1 ratio, meaning 20N-m. Then, if a 2cm worm gear meshes with the rack (is this even possible, or does a standard gear need to be added in between?), the linear vertical force imparted to the rack should be 2000N. I get this from 20N-m / .01m with the latter being the radius of the worm gear. Am I correct with this calculation approach, or is it way off? Would a bigger gear actually produce more linear force on the rack?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a difficult time imagining how such a small setup could produce 2000N of force. With standard gears, you'd have to get some larger gears to achieve that because the gear ratio would need to be high, and the final radius would need to be as small as possible to create a larger linear force on the rack. With the worm drive, you can seemingly accomplish that very easily and with small components.

&amp;#x200B;

The part where I'm overthinking this and going a little crazy is with regards to a manually-powered version where a lever arm is rotated by the user. Let's keep things really simple and conservative and say that the user can exert 100N of force on the lever. If the original motor only needed to generate 1N-m, then the lever arm here should only have to be 0.01m, right? This doesn't make sense to me, and I'm sure that I'm mistaken here.

97,Should I make a two-layer shoe for engineers sitting in the office for long hours?,1545288827,"Hey,

I work as an engineer at a tech company. Sitting at my desk for long hours makes my feet heated, sweaty and restless. I have co-workers who walk around the office in socks or sleepers, but I am not comfortable doing that.

As a solution for my restless feet I was thinking of making a two-layer shoe so that I can take one layer off at work to help with feet breathability and flexibility. The inside-layer (which I will be wearing in the office) will be a bare minimum shoe and yet appropriate for the office. Here's a [drawing](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lbOBMTyH53dgTYzs91U5yMOuYTTG-L9X) of what I have in mind.

I wonder if there are other people like me who feel uncomfortable wearing shoes for long hours? And if so, is a two-layer shoe the right solution? How would one go about manufacturing shoes from ground zero?

Would really appreciate your feedback in [this quick survey](https://goo.gl/forms/C6hgYWkwesHPhWFq1).

3,"Advice, please, on strengthening a carport to support a climbing wall",1545277594," 

Suggestions from engineers/experienced welders, please.

How should I modify this carport to provide three anchor points, for a 300kg (660 pound) climbing wall.

The attached photos show the climbing wall erected using rated chain and a pulley system. The existing anchors are drilled through a load-bearing wall of the house with steel plate both sides.

The climbing wall is to be relocated to an outdoor site, supported by the welded elements of the carport in the photos. My rather poor freehand rendering of its starting position is shown. 1,2 and 3, on the photo are the anchor positions.

There are more photos on the Imgur link.

My plan is to use 22kN climbing-sling anchors, looped over the tubing of the carport, with rated Maillons/quick links connecting to the chain and from there to the climbing wall.22kN is equivalent to a force of over 2 metric tonnes, or 5,000 pounds which should be massive overkill with three anchors.The best place to put the anchors seems to be on the obvious downward-curving tubes near the outer (top) edge of the carport roof, as shown by the approximate position in my diagram.

The site is in Thailand and the carport was made here. Welding standards are not great here however the welds look quite good (relative to other Thai work).

What strengthening will be necessary in the structure of the carport to make this a safe mounting?

Should some welds be thickened or redone?

Will some cross bracing be required?

One part that clearly seems to need beefing up is the small connection half way along each of the proposed anchor-mounting-tubes, to the tube above it.

4,"This might be a very dumb question, but where do you actually learn how stuff moves and what parts it contains?",1545276156,"I have a bachelor's in engineering (small school and kind of niche, so sorry if I keep it vague) and I still can't design some stupidly simple thing like a folding chair or a lightbulb or a simple mechanism for a child's toy. They got our heads full of control theory and MATLAB and other abstract stuff, but for example we never learned how motion is transmitted from an engine to a moving part, what components are necessary to make a machine or device do its things (i.e. what I am looking at when I remove the casing), any notions of design whatsoever etc. For instance, nobody even bothered to tell us that the two essential components of a motor are a rotor and a stator. I actually signed up for an elective that seemed to have something like actuation in its name, but in fact it was only more control theory. Why do I need to know how to calculate a transfer function if I have no idea what is being transferred and why? I think the average student who has completed a technical high school (read: dumb teens) knows more about this than me. During the one mechanics course we had, the profs kept throwing a bunch of terms at us (such as axle) without realising that most of us were never acquainted with basic mechanical pieces, didn't know how they looked like etc., and they didn't stop and explain this stuff.

I insist upon mechanical engineering topics because they're the least familiar to me and at the same time essential to my field, but I have similar questions for electrical engineering, for example. How do I use a circuit board to make a piece move slower or faster, for example? How do I make a turn on/turn off button? Etc.

One of the factors that influenced my decision to go into engineering was the show How It's Made; I loved seeing this logical chain of operations going from raw materials to end product, explained in a layperson's terms. I hoped that higher ed would be like that, but obviously more in-depth and scientific. I was disappointed.

Is there a subject associated with what I describe here? Something that bridges the connection between abstract calculations and the actual function of a device?

Were we even supposed to be taught this? Is this the part where engineering stops being science and becomes art? (As in, using your originality to devise clever solutions to problems)

Was I supposed to learn all this stuff as a prepubescent kid who loved taking stuff apart and putting it together? Or where else? In Tom &amp; Jerry in the episode with the Rube Goldberg machine?

Do I need to browse patents to get an idea of how a certain type of device works?

Do I need to get hands-on and take apart devices to study how they work? (I should mention here that the types of devices that we were supposed to study are not the kind of thing you can fit on the coffee table in your living room.)

Am I mentally deficient in some way for not being able to look at a thing and just \~\*know\*\~ how it works?

8,Career Advice for Not-so-Recent Graduate,1545273315,"tl;dr: Not-so-recent graduate with Master's in Chemical Engineering from Canada. Having trouble landing any entry-level interviews at all, so I'm doing a lot of things wrong but am not aware exactly what. Some advice on changing my approach would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

Conducted research in materials for electrochemical energy generation and storage, and my skillset is in materials science, chemistry and physics. Earned my Master's in December 2017 and shortly after joined a Toronto based startup as a research scientist. While the founder did many things right, the lack of available funding and investment meant that resources were not readily available for anticipated projects and my technical skills did not develop as I would have hoped. Along with concerns over continued compensation, I have been looking for an entry level position at medium to large companies due to their greater stability and opportunities for mentorship.

**Job Search**

My job search has been mainly focused on US based companies, with its much more developed industry compared to Canada.

* So far I have mainly applied to openings to a handful of states: Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, upstate New York, Massachusetts, Idaho. After attending career fairs, I submitted my resumes to other locations including Mississippi and Michigan. While I am trying to be geographically flexible, the former states have been my focus.
* I have applied to anything from intern openings to positions that require 2-3 years of experience. However, I have not applied to technician or business/non-engineering related roles. I have also focused on openings with qualifications involving materials science, chemistry, semiconductor physics or otherwise research related experience. How much do postgrads differ in their first job compared to their research topic?
* Online applications seemed like a black hole with no interviews, so I flew into a couple medium sized conferences with career fairs with the most recent one being in the end of November. I was politely asked to apply online, so it seems my pitch needs quite some work. I sent some follow up emails to thank those I received business cards from, though it has not seemed to affect the decision making process and I have to rely on the strength of my resume.
* Due to the political situation, I am not sure if Canadians eligible for TN-1 nonimmigrant status are viewed exactly the same as H-1B visas. While TN-1 status possibly avoids the lengthy H-1B lottery and visa sponsorship process, how much of a disadvantage am I with only a Master's degree?

**Resume and Experience**

Without any interviews, I know that my resume needs some work.

* In the past year, I consulted my university career services as well as career fair volunteers for advice on my resume. I have also posted an anonymized version on /r/resumes for review. I can also PM anyone here if they want a semi-anonymized version.
* I have tried to tailor my resume for each posting, but some days I submitted the same resume to very similar postings. Currently have \~110 iterations, so I estimate roughly 150 applications with 0 interviews.
* My grades were in the middle among my cohort, but the only conversion for Ontario to US GPA I could find is [here](https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/omsas-conversion-table/). While mine would convert to a 3.7 GPA, I am afraid of overselling myself to a hiring manager using this conversion. On the other hand, I am not sure if my resume would be excluded by a recruiter or ATS without this. How should I list my GPA for entry-level applications?
* All my work experience is research related, including in the Canadian public sector and in US academic labs. I am not sure if I am pigeonholed into starting a PhD, but I don't have any strong desire to go into academia especially after reports such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a530xs/dropout_rate_for_academic_scientists_has_risen). How do companies view research internships compared to industry experience for entry-level positions?
* I have academic publications, but am not sure if I should include them in my resume. While I am not a PhD, [\#8 here](https://cheekyscientist.com/industry-resume/) recommends excluding them. On the other hand, career fair volunteers recommended that I do include them. How much of a priority should I place on these?
* Interests are always a controversial section, but anecdotally it seems that interviewers commented positively as long as they weren't something like Netflix. How would a single point on national coaching certification be viewed by a recruiter or hiring manager, and are humanizing aspects important to a resume?

**Linkedin and Networking**

Other than career fairs, I have mostly used LinkedIn as my main networking tool.

* I was most successful in connecting with alumni, asking for informational interviews. While I learned a lot about their experiences, it has not helped in my short term job search.
* I tried cold contacting several dozen recruiters by mentioning a requisition number and a sentence briefly outlining my qualifications. As expected, I had very little response due to my lack of post-graduation experience.
* I did not try contacting engineering managers or senior engineers to circumvent recruiters. While I have seen this approach recommended on Reddit, I feel very hesitant to do so. How does /r/AskEngineers feel about being cold contacted by a job applicant through LinkedIn?
* Alumni working in the US recommended that for online applications, I should answer that ""I do not need visa sponsorship"" in order to get my foot in the door as the ATS automatically rejects applicants that do. Then, in the interview I would explain TN-1 eligibility which can be conferred immediately at a port of entry at no cost. However, career fair recruiters mentioned that TN-1 is still visa sponsorship. How should I approach this in online applications?

I'm doing an analysis of road construction and maintenance costs on segments with and without permafrost underneath the road. I have 13 segments, each with many projects occurring within it. For each segment I have a total cost of all the projects and I have the length of the segment, and from there I calculated the cost per km to maintain the segment over the entire study period. Easy.

My question arises when I want to compare all the permafrost segments to all the non-permafrost segments (i.e. ""the average cost to maintain the segments built on permafrost was $x/km, vs $y/km for non-permafrost segments""). To get the average cost per km of one type of segment, I can either:

1. Add all the cost per km of each segment and divide by the total number of segments (mean)
2. Add the cost per km \* length of each segment and divide by the total length (weighted mean)

I would prefer to use a weighted average, but because each cost has already been divided by the segment length and I need to re-multiply by the length to use this method, it has the exact same result as if I just divided the total cost of projects on permafrost by the total length of permafrost segments. I feel like I'm losing the effect of each segment's specific cost per km when trying to incorporate exactly that.

TL;DR: If I use a mean I ignore the size/weight of the segments, if I do a weighted mean I somehow ignore it even more.

28,Temperature sensors to detect quantity of fluid in a small pipe.,1545243589,"Hello! This is a cross post from Electronics...but....

This is going to be a random question! I'm working on a project to detect warm fluid flowing along a pipe.

It's pretty simple system with three temperature sensors. Two in the pipe, one located else as a control. If both detect an increase in temperature when compared to the control sensor, it indicates a leak.

Now my question - Can i also use this setup to detect the quantity of fluid too? I was thinking of comparing the time sensor 1 detects an increase versus sensor 2. This would give me time, which could be used to find the velocity of the fluid (Velocity = Distance between sensors / Time).

Then I could use this to calculate the volume of fluid which has passed, where volume of the Fluid = Cross-sectional area of the pipe * Average velocity of the fluid.

Would this work? Or Am I nuts?

For everyones information - Due to the small diameter of pipe, location and function (an area of high vibration) it isn't feasible to use any other type of sensor (I've tried using moisture, flow (hall effect), PIR, Ultrasonic (which worked but the sensors are too big) and LED/LDR) and temperature is the only one that works...

I believe this question is ideally suited for RAMS and/or quality engineers.
The whole point of a critical system is to make sure that for example a car starts braking when one pushes the brake pedal, otherwise the driver may die.

So imagine a car and its braking system. You want to make sure that when pressing the brake pedal the brakes are engaged. What would be the best way to guarantee you brake from a safety/security perspective?

By having two separate (to some extent) unrelated pieces of software that make sure the car brakes? Meaning that when one piece of software for some reason failed, there is no issue because you still have the second piece of software which will send a command to the braking system to brake.

Or by having a duplicate of software that is run on two different pieces of hardware? So that here as well when one part of the system fails you will still deliver the braking command.

Or maybe you'd ideally want something totally different?

I can safely assume the whole volume of water is a homogeneous temperature (not a large volume), and I know how to calculate heat flow through the materials in watts. That heat flow is dependent on delta-T across the material, which changes over time. I was planning to write a smalls script to calculate this iterative-ly (probably in 1 sec increments, it should be a slow enough process and I don't need pinpoint accuracy). I'd like to update the skin temps every iteration, but I don't know how to do that. How do I use energy transfer to calculate the temperature at the boundary between the two insulation layers?

43,Laid off and possibly pigeon-holed - any advice welcome!,1545226567,"Hi everyone!  


As far as careers go, I've had a crappy year. I graduated in 2015 with a Civil Engineering degree and had a job right out of college working for a specialty geotechnical subcontractor and getting great hands-on field experience. This lasted a little over three years and I left there in July of 2018 to work for a competitor in the same region.

The move was based on a few things - 1) I had let management know of some things I was unhappy with (lack of growth, not enough work or responsibility to keep me busy and interested, etc) multiple times and nothing changed, 2) promotion of people who's fathers did business with the company in one way or another and not of those who actually worked for it, and 3) our company was bought out in January by a massive European company and all sense of morale and community and teamwork went down the toilet. It ended up being a miserable place to work so I left and took the first job I found, which was the same scope of work.

Just a few weeks ago the company I moved to decided to close the office I was based out of, and told us we could either relocate to their headquarters (8-10 hour drive and a much less fun city where I have no family), or be laid off. I obviously chose the latter.

I never really understood what people meant when they said it's easier to find a job when you already have a job, but I'm seeing that now. I am also trying to get my foot in the door to some contractors that aren't so specialty to avoid pigeon holing myself, which seems to already have happened in the past 3 years! I've had 7 interviews this week, received one offer that's strong but the company is a crappy commute and I'm not terribly interested in them, and the rest have been for nothing (along the lines of ""you don't have the background we're looking for"", ""you don't have enough experience"", ""you'd be starting from the very bottom here"". I'm using a headhunter who, I've realized, isn't exactly putting my preferences first and is throwing me into any old interview he can find. However I have tried in the past to use LinkedIn, Indeed, etc, and hear back from almost no one.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are a plenty -

Do you think I am already pigeon holed into geotechnical subcontracting?

Should I ditch the head hunter?

How long is ""too long"" to be unemployed for as an engineer (before your chances of landing a job at your current level are very slim)? I've only technically been laid off for 1 week, and was thinking of regrouping after the new year to hopefully find a job at the end of Jan/start of Feb.

Has this ever happened to you or anyone you know?

48,Supply Chain Risk Management: 5 Different Types,1545217499,"&amp;#x200B;

Supply  chain risk, as well as business risk in general, come in many shapes  and forms. The risk comes from the most basic everyday processes to some  extraordinary circumstances that are often hardly identified.

With  all of that being the case, organizations have found several different  ways of managing risk, especially in the supply chain. To stay afloat  and competitive in the market of the modern world, you need to have an  excellent strategy to manage risk. Let’s take a look at some of the ways  risk is managed.

The  change management process should include the suppliers, because this  way, you are making sure that they are notified of any change in the  design phase. It means that the suppliers can always ensure that their  components conform to the new design and are thus able to control the  potential risks.

64,Career Path Question [Network Control Systems as a Mechanical Engineering student],1545175610,"I am a 3rd year mechanical engineer student, last summer I did an internship doing primarily CAD work. I was just offered an internship at a major rail company doing telecom/network control systems. I have a little programming experience but not much other relevant experience. I applied for a different position but they offered me this.

On one hand I feel like this is a decent way to diversify my resume and a way to combine my mechanical engineering with computer science. 

On the other hand I feel like this might be too dissimilar from what I am studying? 

The fact of the matter though is that it will pay well and it's starting to be a little late to look for more internships.

I graduated in spring this year and immediately started working solid waste side of engineering. I do enjoy my work but I feel like it’s incredibly niche, and feels like it’s more regulatory than design. I know it’s too early to do design work yet as I’m only an E.I., but I’m afraid of being cornered into that niche and not being able to try another field like hydrology, water/wastewater. I’m also concerned because I don’t feel like I’m strengthening my technical skills that these fields require, such as hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, making the switch into another field more difficult as I get older but have no experience.

\- What tools do engineers use to decode this type of data? I guess I could manually line thing up but is there software that extracts the data? is this a standard format to do clock/data pulses?

\- What kind of hardware would receivers are used to receive this? Are there special IC's that listen and decode the data or is there a clever trick just using analog components?

\- How do the transmitters work? Are they also special IC's? My under standing is that transmitting in the 500+Mhz range is tricky yet the device is really small and affordable, how are they building something like this?

77,"Jobs other than ""Engineer""",1545149590,"Here are some questions, and my personal perspective:

\-At your place of work, are there many people with engineering *related* degrees that have a job title of Engineer? (not people with classical engineering degrees)

\-Are there people who DO have classical engineering degrees that don't hold the title of Engineer?

\-Do you see a need for people that hold *related* degrees in positions like Designer, Quality Management, or Continuous Improvement?

Why I ask:

I am about to get my BS in Mechanical Engineering Technology. I can do the math, I can do the free body diagrams, I can run CAD and get good data out. But I don't want to be an Engineer. I may never test for my PE license. My goal is to enhance my skills to better understand what Engineers are talking about and be able to translate the important stuff to the guys on the shop floor.

In my experience, most welders, fabricators, assemblers and such have no idea what is going on in an Engineers head. AND typical Engineers are no good at giving the layman's explanation of why that little widget made of onobtanium needs to be welded to the widget made of noweldium, other than to say ""we can't change it"". When this happens, we miss out on improvement options because they can't communicate on the same level.

I am aiming to be the go-between, as I am currently a technical writer with just shy of 2 decades of shop-to-office experience, and I need to get out and interact with the people I write stuff for. I need to be hands on. I also have the urge to understand the design criteria. I am aiming for some title like ""Continuous Improvement Specialist"" or ""Design and Manufacturing Specialist"" (DFMA) or even a place in R&amp;D.

I am a sophomore in engineering and I have been thinking about different possibilities of careers that I can go towards. 

One career possibility is going into R&amp;D for bionics and/or robotics. The inspiration for that is from an MIT professor named Hugh Herr and Boston Dynamics. I love the idea of building limbs to mimic the motion of humans and possibly restore everyday functions to amputees. I would also like to build exoskeletons to enhance the human abilities. It is a touchy subject about whether or not technology should be integrated into our lives and I respect those who have other views. I coach a local FIRST FTC team in my area to learn how to lead and guide a team and to teach middle and high schoolers what it takes to build a robot. Although it’s strictly FIRST Robotics, I do bring in other stuff like a broken drone to fix and make it able to fly again. 

Another possibility is going into aviation. I love flying and learning the ins and outs of an engine. I have a little project on putting an engine on a bike. My plan for this is to finish with my bachelors and go directly into getting my FAA authorized certificate for Airframe and Powerplants Technology. From there, I work to get some experience and see if there’s a company that is willing to help me pay for my Master’s degree. Hopefully, Lockheed Martin could be willing to do that since it’s near my area.

I saw that other post about not knowing anything after graduating and realized that I've felt that way for some time. I graduated a year ago and have been working as an engineer at a manufacturing company for almost a year.

What I like that about this manufacturing job is that I rarely have to use any of the knowledge from my previous courses. It's problem solving but without all the formulas. But I'm afraid that if I leave this job for a different one, I will be asked to work on something that I have no idea how to. 

I had a internship before this job and I had to design something to do with circuits but I had no idea how to do that (I'm not a electrical engineer but it was basic circuit stuff). I took circuits the semester before but felt like I just forgot everything I learned in class and had no idea how to approach this task.

I also didn't do well in college. Graduated with a 2.6 in 4.5 years because I had to retake some classes. Luckily, I had some internships under my belt before I graduated. 

I thought taking and passing the FE would help me a lot but I actually feel like I shouldn't have passed so I'm in the same position I was before I took it. 

My question is: what are some things I can continue to study while I'm working full-time? What are some things that can help me be more confident in my ability to solve problems as an engineer?

**TLDR**: Didn't do well in college so I don't feel confident in my knowledge of engineering courses. Passed the FE but feel like I just got lucky. What can I do or what can I study to improve my engineering skills?

The nozzles will have a smaller ID hose traveling out of the manifold than the main line as I will need a higher flow rate to fill the tank.  I'm not really sure where to start with the calculations for pump size, discharge line ID, etc. on a more complex system like this.

9,What are prospective employers looking for when hiring an entry level aerospace engineer?,1545087499,"Hello, everyone!

I have a couple of questions for any engineer in the field or student that may have constructive feedback. A brief background: I am studying mechanical engineering (undergrad) and after graduation, I plan to acquire a position within the aerospace industry. I am in my junior year/just now hitting my engineering courses (dynamics, materials, etc.). My current university does not offer an aerospace program which is why I chose to study mechanical engineering in lieu of aerospace (at the start of my studies I was unable to relocate). I am now ready to relocate to a university that offers a BS in aerospace engineering.

**My two questions are:** 1) I know for certain that aerospace is the field that I want to work in. Would an employer be more likely to hire a candidate with a BS in aerospace engineering before considering a candidate with a BS in mechanical engineering? 2) Realistically, what is the minimum GPA requirement for an entry level aerospace engineer?

11,I’m a fabricator looking for the best way to determine how much material to order,1545082048,"This comes up every once and a while. I’d like to find optimization formulas to determine the best way to order materials of standard lengths, given a list of parts that need to be cut out and their dimensions, with as little waste as possible. 

My current M.O. is to start by subtracting the longest/largest parts from the standard material sizes and use the remaining pieces of material to make the smaller and smaller parts. It works ok for smaller runs, but not so much for longer runs with more parts and can get pretty convoluted. 

The two situations involve either lengths of tubing that are cut to different lengths, or sheets of material with simple 2d shapes. If I could find a solution to the first situation alone it would save an appreciable amount of time and waste. I realize the second situation gets more involved.

14,Why does this wall plug timer have a gear apparently made of wax? Safety? Planned obsolescence?,1545070563,"Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/5bK0xzS

I have an ""Intermatic Time-All"" wall plug timer that failed. I opened it up and discovered that the first gear in the geartrain had stripped. Furthermore, it was apparently made of wax and crumbled when I touched it.

The need for this ""sacrificial gear"" seems very questionable to me. The motor has a very low torque and seems to draw 20 (±5) milliamps regardless of whether it is being stalled or not, so I don't think that stalling the motor is a safety concern. With the soft wax gear, if increased load is presented (e.g. from friction in the gearchain increasing or from the dial on the front bring impeded from spinning), the gear strips and the device is rendered useless. If the gear were more rigid, the motor would either overcome the friction or stall, to no ill effect.

Presumably the wax has degraded over time because it stripped without me (knowingly) impeding spinning of the dial and because of how easily it crumbled when I touched it, which is another reason that its presence seems like a poor design (or potentially planned obsolescence).

So, were the designers of this device unreasonably paranoid about safety, was it designed to be fragile and fail over time, or am I missing something?",AskEngineers,False,ReversedGif,/r/AskEngineers/comments/a72apr/why_does_this_wall_plug_timer_have_a_gear/

17,New grad offered a technician role. Looking for advice.,1545064733,"Hey all, I'm hoping to get some opinions about an offer I've received.  I just graduated with my Bachelor's in ME from a mid-sized school in the US.  Throughout school I've worked part time as a technician in my university's machine shop.  It's been pretty good, I get a lot of hands on experience and work on a variety of projects for students and professors.  I've been offered a full time position as a senior tech.  Here's a quick breakdown of how I see the role:

**Pros**

* Very laid back environment with a lot of downtime.  I pretty much have carte blanche to work on side projects or learn new skills.  

* If I go for a Master's or other degree tuition would be waived.  I had never considered pursuing this due to the time and cost. 

* Great insurance and job security.  

**Cons**

* Lower pay.  About 30% less than entry level engineering positions I've been interviewing for.

* Little room for advancement.  People tend to stay in the same role here or go up one or two positions over 30 years.  

* No retirement benefits outside the pension plan, which I won't see unless I stay long term.  

I have friends who tell me staying and getting a graduate degree should be a no brainer.  However, I'm concerned about the loss of income if I stay here a few years and the stigma of it being a technician title.  Ultimately I would like to go into management, and I don't know how much of a negative impact that may have.

Over the past 4+ years I've worked on a variety of environmental compliance projects (Title V, AEI, EPCRA, MS4, SPCC, SWDMP, etc.) under a few different PE's with a department supervisor (PE) who will be signing off on all of my experience as well as acting as a reference.

46,"I was offered a job, can anyone help me decide whether or not to counter-offer?",1545005994,"TL;DR at bottom

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

I am a senior studying  for a Bachelors in MET at an ABET accredited university, I graduate in May. I've been working as an mechanical design intern for a consulting engineering firm in a heavy industrial area near Chicago for a little over a year and a half. We primarily do work for steel mills, oil refineries, chemical companies, and pharmaceuticals. I won't lie, I had a pretty rough start, I didn't really know how to operate AutoCAD besides being able to draw shapes. But they gave me a chance and gave me plenty of opportunities to learn under people who knew what they were doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I now have several projects under my belt, in addition I've created CAD standard cheat sheet templates for over twenty of our clients, I wrote an onboarding information package for new hires to help them get accustomed to the company and how things are handled as far as billing, expense reports, standards, where to find information, etc. Also I've done random jobs around the office for people like an intern would be expected to.

&amp;#x200B;

I was offered a position as a Mechanical Design Engineer on Friday, starting at $58,000/year. They want me to get back to them by the end of this month. According to the document, the position being offered wouldn't go into effect until after I graduate, and my current status as $15.50/hr intern would remain until then. 

The health insurance is decent, 401k only matches 40% up to $1,400 so that kind of sucks, sick days, vacation days, all pretty good. 

My question is should I counter-offer? Is there a chance that they would rescind their offer if I do? I'd like to start my career at least making $60,000.

&amp;#x200B;

I already have access badges to two of our biggest clients, also i'm getting my TWIC card in January, I'm broke and haven't been able to afford it. 

According to my immediate supervisor, all the project managers have nothing but good things to say about me, and he claims no one has said or done anything to show that they have no interest in working with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know someone who has been working there for three years who started at $54,000 who is still getting paid the same amount as when he was hired. Granted he likes to take naps in his car during working hours, shows up late, and generally has a bad attitude. 

I know another person who started at 58k four years ago and is now making 68k. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also I'm a Certified Associate in Solid Works, which my company only has 2 licenses for, I've never been asked to use it. I'm taking the CSWP exam sometime in the next few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I've been working as an mechanical design intern for a consulting engineering firm for 1.5 years, they just offered me a job at $58,000 with mediocre benefits. Should I counter-offer and if so what number would be good?

50,Method of Joints with right angles only,1545002913,"This application is actually for a video game I'm working on, but when I've been researching the problem, it seems to fall into Structural Analysis with beams and trusses, so I'm hoping I can get some pointers.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine a spaceship constructed of beams welded at 90 degree angles, no triangles.  There's an engine at the bottom, and off to to the side some distance away, there's a cargo hold of 100 tonnes.  The ship is accelerating at more or less 1 G (10m/s\^2 to keep the math easy).  I have an example created in wonderful MS Paint here:

[https://imgur.com/a/VjMgTJr](https://imgur.com/a/VjMgTJr)

What I'm trying to figure out is the tension and compression for each beam.  The game will have some sort of arbitrary compression and tension limit for each beam to reward ships of better design, like an upper acceleration limit to keep parts of the ship from breaking.   


I've been looking at civil engineering ""method of joints"" calculations, but since there are no triangles, my math keeps coming out as cos(0)=1, sin(90)=1,  so all the horizontal beams have the same force in Newtons, and all the verticals have the same forces as well.  I'm not sure I believe that...  

&amp;#x200B;

According to my diagram, and assuming the beams are massless,  point A has a 1MN force up, making A-B a compressed beam.  But, I'm confused about the moment and how it affects the joints.  If I do a moment around A, it' seems like I should have M(A)=1MN \* 20m=20MNm.  But sum of moments around A should be zero, right?  If  SUM Fx(A) = 0, then that would imply no Fx(A), but if SUM M(A) = 0, then that means there is an Fx(A), right?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to figure out if it has anything to do with there being no real stationary points, it's not attached to anything, it's moving in space.  I realize because of the moment, the ship will spin, but I'll handle that later.  What I'm really shooting for is the tension/compression forces once acceleration starts, so because of inertia, could I treat the structure as pinned at point A?  Since I'm accelerating at 1G with the force at point A, that would more or less be the same as the structure being anchored motionless on the Earth at point A, with gravity acting as the acceleration, right?  

&amp;#x200B;

The basic idea is a handheld tool that is shaped like a drill, but instead of drilling when you pull the trigger, a metal insert on the tip is hammered. 

You would use the tool by pressing it against a surface and the force from the impacts would be transferred to the surface. 

I know the application seems really limited (I only have one in mind) but again this project is just for kicks.

So what I would like to ask is:

1. Is something like this even really possible? Would it be able to deliver any real impact comparable to a hammer, at such a small handheld size? Im not dead-set on having it be a drill shape either, its mostly the size that I care about.

2. Should it run on electric or pnuematic power?

I live in the rural North East on a wooded lot.  I am planning on adding wood heat to my house as a secondary source of heat to back up my heat pump when the power inevitably goes out.   The abundance of trees on the property generates a lot of brush in addition to cord wood.  It is new construction and as I expand the yard and thin the little junk wood off the property the brush pile grows and grows.  I have a large wood chipper and have begun to chip the brush.  It seems like a terrible waste to just let the wood chips rot into the ground when heat is such a concern.  I would love to be able to burn them but I know they would need to be dried first in order to make burning worth it.  After some quick internet research it looks like biomass drying is typically done in kilns of some sort on the industrial scale but I am wondering if I could do it passively somehow.  Obviously protecting the wood chips from rain and ground moisture is important.  I also know getting air flow to them will be important too.

The first idea I had would be to have a hopper that dumped into a slanted screen tube which then emptied into another hopper.  The tube would rotate at a very slow rate so chips would slowly be turned and exposed to the air as they were transferred from the ""green"" hopper to the ""dry"" one.  The tube could be powered a variety of ways, hand, wind, solar, electrically, etc.  Would this work?

Does someone have a seat of the pants estimate of how long is would take a 1"" layer of wood chips to go from green to 15% moisture?

I work as an engineer at a solar panel factory and have access to used and scrap industrial electronics which is why everything is 24volts here in my project.

I currently have a 24 volt system powering 3 small lights. Project is to have pi control 3 lights.

Currently this system operated manually via buttons closing relays.

All hardware is Schneider Electric: 24v S.E. PSU, powering 3 24v S.E. lamps. The lamps are on 24volt S.E. relays. So it’s all 24 volt currently.

The relays control circuit voltage is 24... so here is my first problem. How to get the RPi to operate my 24v relays? This project is already built i just want to add the rpi to automate. So I don’t want to replace my existing relays. However I would not be opposed to adding another set of pi switchable relays to operate the 24v lamp relays. What is an easy and small way to solve this problem?

How can I power the rpi with my 24v power supply? Also a tiny solution would be best not a lot of room. aesthetics are a must this needs to look good.

Can anyone recommend a battery for the pi that can be installed in this. Maybe a hat?

82,Advice to an IE - Masters vs Industry Certs,1544910604," 

Hello fellow engineers

I just graduated a semester early as an Industrial Engineer and am starting job as a manufacturing engineer. Would it be better to:

A) Get a masters in industrial engineering. I have 3 masters classes done as part of a 5 year program and could finish the other 7 within 1 year while I work. Will it realistically get me a pay raise like everyone says it will? Will it hurt me down the line if I dont have one?

B) Get industry certifications such as Lean Six Sigma Black Belt, Engineer-in-Training, Certified Quality Technician, ect. I currently already have my green belt.

I bought a minivan last year and started parking above it, but as you can probably see, I park about 5 feet set-in from the wall.   For a variety of reasons, I would like to keep parking there, though I could move the van as a last resort.

I asked my landscaper to do a design, and he seemed really concerned about beefing up the retaining wall to support the vehicle.  He gave me a quote for $24K to do a new retaining wall with special blocks that can support a vehicle.  He was saying that if I parked the van elsewhere, that I could cut the costs in half, but he was also goading me into blocking the above area off so that I car couldn't park there mistakenly.

I like my landscaper, but he's not an engineer, and I think he might be overly cautious.  My dad and step-mom are engineers, though this isn't their specialty, and they said I shouldn't worry about a retaining wall that's so short.

I'm not an expert, but I think my personal thought was just to build a retaining wall in front of this one and backfill it...  Not sure if that is a crazy or stupid idea.

So, my question is whether any engineer here has any clear solutions?  Or should I consult a structural engineer?  I have a few topics I would like to ask an engineer about, but I wasn't sure how to go about hiring one or how expensive it would be?

95,Engineer Working Remotely - Planning to move from PA to CO this spring and my current company offered me a remote position in order to retain me. Pros and Cons?,1544842208,"As the title says. I would appreciate any feedback on this. What do you see as Pros and Cons and do you have suggestions and tips if I would take this role?

A little background on myself:

I am 24 years old and a 2017 Mechanical Engineering grad. I went on a long trip post-college and just got back to the states in October. I moved back with my parents for a few months with the plans to move to the Denver Colorado area, mostly due to the great outdoor opportunities. I am an avid climber, trail runner, and cyclist.

A local PA company I had interned at during college offered me a position as a sales engineer. I declined due to my plans to move to Colorado so they offered me a 6-month position since they needed the help and really hoped to be able to convince me to stay long term (I had made it very clear that I planned to move to CO). I accepted the position since I needed some time to find a job in CO.

After working there for about two months, they have offered me a remote position. I would be in an inside sales and estimating position (but remotely) with the opportunity to also work in remote sales in the future if I want to.

This seems like a good opportunity, but I feel there are some strong drawbacks.

Pros:

* Freedom - I value this highly. I will have way more flexibility with my schedule. I will still be expected to work within the normal working hours but I will have a lot of flex. I can take a 2-hour lunch break if I want to go for a run or just need a break.
* After only two months in the office, I already feel stifled. I love to be outside, I am very active, and I love to travel. Sitting in an office for 9 hours a day is killing me.
* I have family and friends in PA and would be coming back from CO a few times a year. Now I could come back, see family, and work at the office for a few days. I could easily merge this since my parents are 5 minutes from the office.
* It does not have to be a long-term commitment. If the job is not working out I can quit and there would not be hard feelings from my company.

Cons:

* Lack of career development. As a young engineer, I feel that this may stunt my development to grow under others
* Isolation - It could be easy to become disconnected from the company
* Social interaction - I would have to be intentional to network and the workday could get lonely by myself
* Inefficient. It's easier to walk down the hall to ask someone a question than to call or email them
* Lack of oversight - I would have to stay driven and self-motivated or it could quickly get out of control.

1,"Minimalist clock: Is it feasible to send light from RGB LED to different physical locations, determined by LED color/wavelength, mediated by a prism?",1544827964,"This is 100% frivolous and non-critical to anyone's happiness. In a discussion about making an extremely minimal clock (e.g., with an ESP8266 board or similar), I started wondering if a prism (IDK which material) could be used to send light from an RGB LED to slightly different physical locations within a small, alarm-clock-sized housing.

My idea, such as it is, is this:

* 3 or 4 light collectors/diffusers (like small frosted glass cylinders or something) located right next to each other, embedded in a light-tight clock case, allowing any light shining on them from inside the case to illuminate them to an external viewer.
* LED inside the case (driven by the ESP8266 or similar), with a prism between it and the collectors/diffusers mentioned above; light would go: LED --&gt; prism --&gt; diffusers --&gt; external viewer.
* Process: LED lights up. This sends light through the prism, and the light exits at a certain angle, headed toward the collectors/diffusers. Because of the exit angle, the light only shows up in one of the diffusers, determined by light color.

So, for example, if the collectors/diffusers were oriented in a vertical line on the clock case, if the LED were red, it might only light up the bottom-most diffuser, so an external viewer would see only the bottom one illuminated and the others dark. If the LED were green, it would only illuminate the middle diffuser, and if it were blue, it would only illuminate the top diffuser.

One problem I can see is that the LED sends light in many directions at once, so restricting the flow of light might be difficult. Still, does this sound feasible for a home hobbyist?

26,Did you guys have trouble finding a job after graduating with a low GPA? CANADA,1544761749,"I'm sorry if this is not the location to ask this, but I can find no better place and I'm desperately looking for answers.

I'm trying my damn hardest in Engineering but I only manage to pull about a 62% average, on our schools grading system this is 60-69 is ""Satisfactory"" but that is all that you can get. I think this translates roughly to a C average. Canadian grades are weird.

I'm very worried that I will not be able to find work after I graduate; I plan on boosting my grades and focusing more on school next year so I can get an internship (Academic advisers say that a 65% is almost guaranteed internship). I'm also fairly sociable (compared to the rest in engineering) and consider myself to be pretty decent with people.

I consider myself to be a hard worker with unrelenting persistence. Obviously I'm not doing great in school but I have a part time job, I also dedicate a great portion of my time to working out, I take numerous risks and face countless rejections with women (this sounds random and stupid but being rejected so many times has built confidence in myself, persistence, etc etc), and when I have free-time I typically spend it learning about practical stuff like psychology.

So far I've been convincing myself that I will be okay. I'm telling myself that even though I'm not a number crunching wizard, I can compete with the kids who have A's because I have skills they don't. I've been telling myself that my social skills, my leadership qualities, my practical real life problem solving skills, are more important than the 2.0 GPA I'm pulling because I couldn't learn the most random mundane inapplicable quadruple integral theorem found on chapter 182.3 in the physics fuckbook. 

So I need some real advice. Am I screwed or not? I hear from numerous sources that I will never even be asked for my grades.

41,Am I being stupid to try to pivot into software?,1544734791,"Hey reddit, 

I'm in a weird situation. So I've been going to school part time since 2011. I changed my major a bunch and my grades have been pretty meh. I'm finally finishing up my bachelor's in industrial and systems engineering next week. 

So the reason it's taken me so long to graduate is I've been working full time during my entire college career. During that time I did 3 semesters of internships.

2013 - Worked for an automotive supplier doing vehicle software stuff with the PM team. A friend got me the job and I felt really out of place and underqualified, even compared to the other interns. I honestly didn't learn much and it had nothing to do with my degree. 

2014 - Spent two semesters at an energy company doing literally nothing. A week after I got hired my manager took a different job and his replacement did not give a single fuck what I was doing all day. The money was too good to quit but everything I would try to get involved with was basically just busy work. There wasn't much I could do, the office I was in was in the middle of nowhere and no engineers worked there other than the guy who left. I basically just did homework all day.

2015 - Pizza delivery dude, actually ran a store for a month too before realizing it was way too much responsibility for the money and would make my classes impossible.

2016 - Got a job as a vehicle software technician. I was actually amazing at this. We would test the software in cars and write tickets when we found issues. 

2017 - Boss realizes I'm really good at this tech job so he sits me down and realizes I'm almost done with my degree. He moves me to a new position inside working on EMC testing. I know nothing about EMC or electricity (I was actually taking circuits 1 at the time). Somehow I fumble through and everyone is really impressed with the progress I make over here.

2018 - I get a job offer from my old lab to be an engineer doing matlab/simulink models for vehicle software even though I literally know nothing about this stuff. I've been doing that since August and am starting to understand stuff.

Now that friend that got me the first internship is trying to get me a job at that company. It's a much better job and almost definitely pays a lot better than where I'm at (I work through a contract house and make 52k as an engineer, non contract people start at 80k minimum).

I know I'm way underqualified for what I do, the problem is that I actually fit really well for this new position on paper and can probably get the job. All of my experience is in software, but I feel like I don't know anything about it at all. Should I just pack it up and try to go into Industrial engineering? Would I even be able to since I have no experience? I'm just insanely stressed and have no idea what to do. The new job would be working in some really cool growth areas related to autonomous applications, so I would really rather be doing that than running time studies on a factory floor, but I'm worried that there's something I'm missing in terms of my skillset that will just never show up without actual electrical/software/computer science education.

I am on a construction site for a significant ($2Bil+) pharmaceutical plant doing electrical field engineering work. A big part of this is field routed cable tray and conduit that must be fit into tight areas in what remaining real-estate we have.

Currently I am going out on the field and investigating areas that we need to run power/control/signal cables and determining where we can fit conduit or tray... I am then marking it up in the model with MS paint.. it works but sometimes its a little hard to convey to my designer just using that application with its good but limited function.

Are there any apps that you guys may recommend for drawing? I was going to download a few free photoshop-type apps on my ipad (with the apple pencil) to sketch tomorrow so I can do these a little better, but maybe there is a program on PC that can do it, if any of my fellow construction field engineers have run into this type of situation before.

75,Aerospace/Defense: Interning for Textron Inc. or Harris Corp?,1544669303,"Hello Engineers,

I just signed up for Reddit because an internal conflict that I can't seem to find a clear answer for. I'm currently a sophomore at Purdue University and around mid-October, I landed my first internship offer! Textron Inc. is a pretty big name in the Aerospace/Defense Industry, as it parents Cessna, Beechcraft, Hawker, Textron Systems, etc. Needless to say, I was beyond excited to work for such an amazing company. They gave me 2 weeks to accept the offer, which I did without question.

&amp;#x200B;

A week ago, I received a call from Harris Corp regarding another acceptance offer. Harris is another Fortune 500 company, and a big player in the industry. They work on GPS, microwave signals, and small satellites- and are currently under contract with NASA to build another satellite telescope. I have a week to accept this offer- and if you can infer, this is where the conflict lies.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question: Should I revoke my current contract with Textron Inc. in favor of Harris?**

&amp;#x200B;

Context:

&amp;#x200B;

\- My goals are to work for Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop, BAE, etc. 

\- Both companies pay the same hourly rate, but Textron is giving me a larger upfront housing stipend.

\- Harris Corp is located in Palm Bay, Florida and Textron is going to be somewhere in the midwest (They haven't assigned ma a location yet) 

\- Textron is a very decentralized company, and have other companies like aviation, military technology, specialized vehicles (Off road vehicles), Arctic Cat (snowmobiles), Greenlee (lawnmowers). They are going to assign me a unit in the Spring, but I run the risk of not being placed in Aviation or the Defense side. 

\- Harris already told me exactly where I'll be working, and I know I'll be working on relevant technology  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just curious to see what you, more established engineers would do in my position. All answers will be taken into account into my final decision.

81,Custom wood stove efficiency calculations,1544654323,"I have a workshop heated by a custom built wood stove (rocket design, low mass). I usually burn soft wood pellets in batches of 1kg. Each batch takes about 90 minutes to finish and pretty consistently raises the temperature by 4C (stove on one end, sensor in the middle, fan distribution). Depending somewhat on outside temperature, it will take around 8 hours to drop 4C to the original temperature. 

I'm wondering if and how one might determine other useful information based on those numbers/slopes. For example:

- What is the mass being heated in the shop assuming fairly efficient burning and heat transfer of the pellets?
- And if the mass can be found, could heat output from the stove ever be known? Or efficiency?
- If I compare against outside temperature, perhaps my overall insulation R value?
- Would the inlet, combustion, and exhaust temperatures be helpful for anything? Airflow through the system? Mine has an external inlet, so no air enters the structure for combustion, but other designs have internal inlets pulling outside air in.

These questions are often missing from discussions on ""creative"" heating solutions, how to quantify the resultant heat output in a consistent way so we're making useful comparisons. I'm just curious to know if I can reliably make anything useful from the facts that can be reasonably gathered. Thanks!

I know the total volume of the vessel and am assuming that all water vapor condenses in the condenser. Also, I have the pump curves for the vacuum pump.

My questions:

1. How does the vacuum pump take any air out and maintain a vacuum in the system? Because if it is pulling through a condenser, then it is really pulling water (that has condensed). Is there just a low pressure zone created at the input of the vacuum which is causing vapors to leave the evaporator vessel?

2.   How do I calculate the flow-rate of air leaving through the vacuum pump. The pump is creating a vacuum in the vessel (around 22inHgV) and I have the total volume of the vessel and the liquid level in the vessel. Do I just use the vacuum pump curves here? I don't know if these pump curves will tell me the CFM of AIR or of WATER VAPOR leaving the vessel.

&amp;#x200B;

Junior engineer here with a big decision to make and no idea of what to choose. Right now I'm jobless and I have 2 job offers on my doorstep and don't know what to choose. Veteran engineers please help me.

&amp;#x200B;

* One job offer is technical and maintenance based for the house team. I have experience in that field and didn't find it very difficult to get interviews for this field. The job involves moving to the other side of the country and doing night shifts. It's a permanent position, decently paid and comes with a small relocation fee.

&amp;#x200B;

* The other job offer is more management based. I've had a lot of problems trying to get into this field because I have no experience in managing teams or instalations. The experience this job provides would be key for  evolving as an engineer and break through a totally new field for me. This position is TEMPORAL, for the duration of the project (from 6 to 2 years), and subcontracted and would require no relocation for me. The salary they are offering me is very competitive as well.

I am very privileged to being able to choose. I have never been able to choose a position before and have no experience negotiating with companies. Both of them are pressuring me right now to sign the contract asap.

My day to day involves running CFD, but that's only a small part.  I have done a lot of one-off analyses.  Some involve using CFD and then building a model of a system with the results.  In some cases I have extracted information from the CFD solution and generated inputs for other models.  In other cases I have started with a problem and derived governing equations, then solved then either analytically or numerically.  I feel like a lot of what I do is similar to applied math but I don't really know.  I generally use more math than most of my coworkers.

9,Structural Engineer with MSc in Structural Engineering considering pursuing a Comp. Sc. Masters as part time.,1544593470,"Hi Everyone,

Ive been doing coding since undergrad and I finally made the decision to pursue a masters in computer science because my employer can cover some of the tuition (almost 6k per year, I am willing to pay some from my pocket if required ofcourse).

I have a few questions:

Do I have to have done an undergrad in comp. science to be ""comfortable"" during my masters or will I feel a huge knowledge gap compared to others who have studied comp. science in their undergrad?

Ive used alot of python, C++, matlab, fortan and excel VBA during my undergrad, masters and work. I think I know most of the basics of coding such as object oriented etc. I am also learning C# now and how to create a plug-in for some of the software we use in the company. I am confident that I am a very fast learner. My undergrad GPA was 4/4 from an ABET accredited university abroad and Ive completed my masters in canada and did very well (95/100 average and 2 journal, 4 conference papers published).

I already looked into some programs local to New York City and most of them just require me to take two undergrad courses to get admitted to the program.

If I take these two undergrad courses, will I be fine? I will be taking my masters part time during evening classes. I am just afraid ill feel so behind and will have to put immense effort just to feel I am equal to others with a comp. science undergrad.

Anyone with experience please share. Also if anyone can recommend good programs in NYC (that are affordable and reputable) that would be helpful. Thank you!!

I wired everything to work as a standard 4-way switched circuit and am left with the pilot light circuit.  For all intents and purposes, the  pilots are just another light circuit, as the switch provides a completely separate hot and neutral wire for it.

How do I modify the circuit so that these pilot lights are to turn ON when the light controlled by the 4-way circuit turns OFF?

The  problem that is faced with a 4-way circuit is that the traveler wire that causes the common to be hot to the light can be different depending upon the up-down pattern of the switches at the moment.

\- Really nice people and team management; it seems like even an asshole like me will enjoy the peoples company there.

\- Good pay.

However there are some drawbacks:

\- The position is a purely industrial engineering job, where the goal is to optimise the manufacturing process.

Plus that means I'll get orders from the R&amp;D guys and work my ass off of someone's else ideas. Not a plus.

\- The technology they are working on is interesting, but mature. Which automatically means is less interesting than most of emerging technologies that will change the world soon.

I just transferred to Cornell from a community college.  It took me forever to decide on Civil engineering as I am incredibly indecisive.

Now that I'm at a four year university I was hoping to take a larger scope of structural, geotechnical, statistics, and water resources/mechanics courses to see what I am interested in, beyond the core requirements required by my major.  Is this a poor move? Should I try to narrow it down into one of the concentrations they recommend? (Note: concentrations are recommended but do not show on your diploma)  I recently finished Fluid mechanics and it is probably one of my favorite course I have taken to date and it’s making me question my approach.

The 707 was stressed to about 3.9-4 G or so (with the BOAC 707 experiencing peak vertical loads of 7.5+ G), while the ultimate G load for a 787 is around 3.7 G, so if anything, the old 707 is slightly structurally more durable and resilient than a more modern plane.

I've seen a Boeing spokesman say this, as well as people on Quora who claim they're aeronautical engineers. It's like saying a building with an earthquake magnitude rating of 6 will survive but the building with an earthquake magnitude of 7 will not. I've seen it repeated in fear of flying books too.

They also say that a modern plane is designed to withstand 150% of the ''most extreme forces'' the plane will ever encounter, when that's just plain wrong, since 3.7 G's isn't the most extreme turbulence forces a plane will encounter, the BOAC 911 Flight saw 7+ G's from turbulence. The 150% thing assumes a measly 2.5 G is the strongest G force turbulence can put on a plane, which is also proven wrong by the fact this SouthWest flight in 2011 almost became another BOAC 911 when it experienced mountain turbulence that put 3.52 G+ on the plane, very close to the 3.7 G's where the wings will snap off. https://www.aeroinside.com/item/3306/southwest-b737-near-oakland-on-dec-1st-2011-turbulence-injures-three-cabin-crew",AskEngineers,False,RemoteRaspberry,/r/AskEngineers/comments/a51pux/why_do_people_say_a_modern_airliner_will_never/

I'm 20 years old, live in the UK and am currently in the second year (of four) of an engineering apprenticeship. My apprenticeship involves maintaining heavy plant/industrial equipment (cranes, shovel-loaders, forklifts and the like). I will finish the apprenticeship with a HNC in mechanical engineering, and a level 3 NVQ.

Now for the job I think I want. I was re watching Netflix's selection of mega-builders episodes (as you do), and while I cant now remember the specifics of the episode (I think they were building a bridge in Dubai maybe?) one guy stood out to me as having a job I think would be good for me to aim for. The guy appeared to be reasonably high up the management chain, and while I don't remember an actual job title being given I believe he was in charge of a specific section of the job. A sort of ""sub-project manager"".What stood out to me was that he was still ""on the ground"" as it were. He was with the workers, proposing solutions to problems as they came up, and in some cases doing parts of the work himself. This is something which interests me as when it came down to me making a decision on whether or not to take my current apprenticeship, my other option was doing an accounting degree. I chose the apprenticeship on the basis I didn't want to be stuck in an office. I like working hands on.

So my question is, how do I get from here to there? I assume getting my degree would be required? I've been considering a degree through open university so that will take 6 years part time. What sorts of jobs should I be looking for while doing that? What jobs should I be looking at after the degree? Whats the ""path""?

84,"Based on this text, do you think I should go into engineering?",1544438089,"So basically my thoughs right now are that I hate my major. I study English literature here in Czech and the more I study it the more I hate it. The reason is that it all comes way too easy to me and while it is great because I have so much free time I hate it because I wanted to be challenged, I though college no matter what provides enough challenge to me but I was wrong. 
I have chosen this major because I would like to write some day but all I ever learn is how blue curtains might or might not be a sign of depression in authors mind. 
So why Engineering? That is a great question. I like that it uses almost any branch of science, you need to know a lot but dont have to go in too much abstract. I also like the idea of really doing something and not just thinking (boy my high school me would disagree.) It also seems to be a great field for creativity and challenging which is great. I know that I would be hating myself whenever I would be forced to stay awake trough the night and studying but that is exactly what I want. I know it sounds insane, but I feel that things have been easy for too long and I dont think engineering would come anywhere near easy for me.

88,"Why is it possible to launch a car in first gear, using idle engine RPM, and slow clutch engagement?",1544424673,"Greetings,

My best guess is as the friction plate increases contact with the flywheel, it gradually decreases the torque needed to spin the tires, and prevents the engine RPM from dipping low enough to stall. But I'm not feeling confident about that, and I hope to be schooled on the matter.

I know that idle RPM produces enough torque to rotate the tires, but why can't I just dump the clutch? Instead, I have to gradually engage the clutch.

90,New grad here - should I take this job offer?,1544422958,"Hey all, hoping to get some advice on a job offer I'm a little uncertain about. 

For some background, I just graduated with my BS in mechanical from a mid-ranked school.  My resume is ok but not great...GPA below 3.0, one internship, and some projects through clubs.

Throughout undergrad I also worked in the university machine shop / makerspace as a technician. It's been a good experience.  They've given me an offer to stay on full time as a senior tech, but I'm having a tough time deciding if it's a good or bad career move.  

**Pros**

- Lots of freedom.  The job has a ton of down time and I essentially have carte blanche to work on side projects.  

- Tuition is waived after 1 year of employment.  I could get my master's or a second degree at no cost.  This is something I never considered in the past.  

- Low stress, great benefits.

**Cons**

- Mediocre pay, about 30% less than the average starting salary for an engineer in the area.

- Little room for growth.  Guys who work here do the same job or move one or two levels up over 30 years.  

On one hand it's very appealing as I'm comfortable here and the salary is certainly more than I make now and is enough to live on.  My friends are telling me I'd be crazy not to stay for a few years to get my master's or MBA (long-term I'd like to get into the management side of things).  On the other hand I'm worried about the loss in salary and career stagnation.  I started things late and am already in my 30's, so there's a rush to get things moving.  I've gotten a few interviews from other companies and I feel pretty confident I could find an entry level engineering position relatively quickly if I keep applying.

92,"Engineers, why aren't self propelled trailers a thing?",1544414808,"Today a friend brought up the idea of having a trailer (as in a truck towing something) with an electric motor to propel the trailer forward, thus using less fuel from the tow vehicle. For arguments sake it would also have solar panels to generate that energy. He said the added electric power would make a less powerful car be able to tow more weight, and the batteries being mounted low on the trailer would help with stability.

I have no engineering knowledge but I thought of what could be issues with the idea, but I really don't know if they make any sense. Would the extra electric power just be eaten up by the weight of the batteries? Wouldn't adding weight make a trailer more likely to sway, even if it was mounted low? Would an insane amount of solar panels be necessary? I know it'd be a nightmare to wire it into your car to know when to accelarate/brake.

5,Is Engineering Right For Me?,1544390497,"Hello, I am new to posting on here but not new to the forum itself. I hope this is the right place to post this. I have done extensive research on here about this, but can't seem to get enough information to satisfy my issue. My apologies as this is a bit long-winded. Like probably most other mechanical engineers out there I loved building and taking things apart as a child. Legos, Lincoln logs, marble run, you name it. I swapped engines on my go kart, built pneumatic air cannons, and loved being outside and working with my hands. I enjoy working on my car, troubleshooting issues and figuring out solutions, and love collecting WWII knick knacks and installing them in my car (most recently a Spitfire voltmeter into my e36, and a WWII compass into my e30). Watching the science channel was always interesting, and I loved Mythbusters. My mom always said I should be an engineer. After high school I attended a local community college and got my associates in liberal arts (useless but the knowledge isn't) and finished with honors with a 3.95 gpa. I even received an award for excellence in the social sciences. The classes always came quite easily to me and I didn't have to spend a great deal of time outside of the classroom preparing or doing home work, something I know will not be the same with engineering. I really enjoyed my Philosophy classes and my government classes as well and really every other class, but this is where my problem starts- I feel like I like *everything,* and I'm good at most everything I try, or I will try to get better. I like to lift, talk politics, read, watch history shows, think about the human body, and I'm always analyzing things to figure out relationships and why things cause other things to happen. Liking everything is tough (I know there are far worse things in the world) because it is incredibly difficult to differentiate between hobby and job. I have narrowed it down to Mechanical Engineering or Accounting/Finance. I will be attending SUNY New Paltz in the Spring regardless of what I choose, this college has a great business program accredited by the AACSB and none of the other majors offered really interest me. I know I will be able to handle whatever business classes I will encounter but I cannot say the same for engineering. I took calc 1 in fall 2017 and did alright with a B, but I didn't really apply myself as deeply as I could've and found myself lacking perseverance for it because it didn't come 'naturally' and I wasn't good at it like most of the other classes I took during college. I enjoyed precalc and AP stats when I took them in high school and loved geometry back in the day. I am not necessarily super interested in accounting/finance but I feel like it would be interesting enough, and would lead to a good job. I have been out of full-time classes for about a year and half now but I'm anxious to get back into it. I enjoy having free time and being able to go to the gym and hangout with friends and work as well, and I know this will most likely take a big hit if I go the engineering route, but if grinding now means a better future then I will push through. My one concern is not having the perseverance necessary to get through engineering as sometimes I get easily discouraged. If I go the business route I can finish within 1.5-2 years, but engineering will likely take me 3-4. I am 21 now but will be 22 when the semester starts. So here are my questions; 

\-is perseverance and pushing through the tough shit something that any engineers pick up during their schooling? 

\-Do I seem like a good candidate for the engineering field? Is my interest in building things, taking things apart and analyzing relationships etc enough for a prospective engineer or are the jobs after graduation not like this? 

\-How stressful are mech engineering jobs compared to jobs in say accounting/finance? I do like work-life balance

\-Will it be tough to take calc 2 after taking calc 1 a year ago or can I grab a crash course book and a tutor to prepare myself? 

\-If I do get my degree in acc/fin will I be able to meander myself into the engineering field later on in my life or will I have to go back for another bachelors? 

\-Are there engineers out there that wish they kept creation and building and design as a hobby?

&amp;#x200B;

The fridge in my trailer is freezing over, even at the lowest setting. This is really problematic as it causes my pitcher of filtered water to freeze and causes some food to go bad (for example eggs freezing and splitting).

&amp;#x200B;

I have done some research and I think the problem may be due to the temperature sensor or the thermostat itself, but I'm not skilled or knowledgeable regarding handiwork, especially not electrical or refrigeration issues. I feel I may need to take a ground up approach to solving this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Other factors that may be relevant to my problem:

\-It is winter and I live in the mountains. I am unsure how the external temperature would effect my unit. The back of the unit is more or less exposed to the outside via a grilled access panel. I vaguely recall having a similar problem last winter and so I am inclined to believe the outside temperature is a factor.

\-The fridge is old and perhaps the seals around the fridge door as well as the internal freezer compartment are not sealing properly. Ice collects around the seal of the freezer compartment.

\-There is a metal wire protruding through the interior rear wall of the fridge that attaches to the rear of a panel of ""fins"" that are mounted just underneath the freezer compartment (the freezer compartment is the topmost part of the fridge.) This wire is rusty, and I suspect it was meant to make contact with the ""fins"" at certain points or maintain a specific shape, as there is a ""u"" shape bend in the wire that is not rusty where the wire is actually connected to the ""fins"". Also, these ""fins"" drip with condensation or otherwise collect ice.

13,"I keep ending up in unchallenging/deadend positions within my company. Is it just the nature of the industry, or possibly the company?",1544385062,"Obligatory throwaway. Work with rockets within aerospace/defense at a very big company. I've been in 3 different positions within the company and they all seem to demonstrate the same traits. There's practically no room for innovation, so a lot of our work comes down to maintenance -- take what people have done in the past and apply it to this particular vehicle, or make sure that this same ol' part can survive the rocket conditions for this launch. It's pretty much just a bunch of work to ease the customers' minds. We're just showing the customers that nothing has changed since our last successful launch, basically.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I end up in positions that are extremely overspecialized. I hear that large companies might tend to do this anyway, but add in the aerospace/defense industry, and it feels even more exaggerated. Sometimes I also feel like a ""warm body"" AKA someone there just for emergencies if the company needs a lot of bandwidth. Otherwise, I feel like the company is charging $X/hr to the customer while paying me $X/hr, which nets the company income regardless of if I do any work.

&amp;#x200B;

I left my last position because I knew that I could master it within a couple of years. And that's not me being cocky. That's really just me looking at the senior engineers (15+ years) in the group and thinking, ""that's pretty much what I'll be doing in just a couple years."" I got out of there and joined a group which sounded much more promising on the innovation side. I love to be creative and solve problems with no clear-cut answer, and so I accepted the offer. Turns out that even R&amp;D within this company is bland and has to deal with the extreme red-tape of the government contracting world. I still don't even know what I'm really doing in this group even though I've been in it for 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

About me and the company: I don't want to overspecialize so early in my career. As I said earlier, I want to innovate and bring my creative side to the table. I did really well in school (summa cum laude) and I feel like I've been relegated to the most menial work -- menial beyond even simple busy work. I have only worked at this company post-graduation, so I often wonder if it's just the industry or possibly even just the company that isn't working out for me. The way I view my company is that it's a GREAT place to go to retire in once you've got yourself a family and desire to settle down. But for a new person in the field, it's just one big training factory to turn me into a ""technical assembly line worker,"" as I describe it. As of now, I absolutely love the company culture. Great coworkers, great managers, good pay, awesome schedule/flexibility, but the work has been lacking. If I could rate it, it would be:

&amp;#x200B;

Pay = 9/10

Culture = 9/10

Work = 2/10

&amp;#x200B;

My big question is, did I just happen to land several jobs that are more geared towards older folk who might care more about the job security and benefits than the job itself? Or is this just the general experience that people in aerospace/defense/government contracting tend to get? (Also, I know that due to my ratings, people might say, ""You get to pick 2 out of those three,"" but I definitely could sacrifice the pay if it meant upping the work interest, considering that I don't have any family or spouse right now.)

17,How would I test motor efficiency?,1544379397,"Hi, I have an electric motor that I want to test and plot efficiency. The motor itself a brushed DC and is 24V and pulls around 25 A (with spikes up to just under 70 A without soft start). Unfortunately the manufacturer does not supply this data and even if they did I would want to verify the correctness of the data and compare similar motors off the production line. How can I measure efficiency with the goal being a plot of speed along the X axis with efficiency up the Y axis?

As I see it the 4 key variables are Current draw and voltage (to give input power), and output torque and output speed (to give output power). 

So my initial plan is to spin the motor up and measure all 4 variables. Current draw and voltage are easy using multimeters. Output speed should be simple using an optical encoder but torque I'm unsure how to easily measure. Are there any low cost and relatively accurate methods of measuring torque?

The testing I initially planned would give what I believe is the free running efficiency. The motor is intended for use in an electric vehicle so load on the motor will be constantly varying due to inclines, acceleration, braking, etc. Will the varying load on the motor effect its efficiency?

How can I test this motor to give me meaningful data about efficiency ",AskEngineers,False,EdCChamberlain,/r/AskEngineers/comments/a4n649/how_would_i_test_motor_efficiency/

35,Struggling with my job and unhappy,1544310283," 

All,

I seriously hate my day job as a test engineer. The reason I hate it is because I struggle daily with my tasks and I cannot do the work effectively in my view, although in my managers eyes I am fine from yearly reviews. I have made some embarrassing mistakes, but those IMO have been due to being overworked/over tasked from the very beginning of my career. I work in the automotive industry and I was given a program to test and develop, but timing for this program has been terrible and I have had very little aid in learning everything. This was my initial job first starting. Then, I was given more programs to run as our sub group in our company lost three engineers and only replaced with one.  I guess my hope in writing this is that I'm not alone. I feel like everyone around me works either as a team well or does work by themselves solely by themselves effectively. I think the main issue with much of my work is that

1. my job spans over many technical fields, and I have to be a ""jack of all trades"" which does not fit with my skill set.
2. I have a hard time remembering everything that I have done and need to do. I have worked on various tracking methods with excel and nothing seems to help since I get over tasked and overworked. I usually have 10-20 items that are very important that need done daily and I can maybe do two or three of those. I tend to forget where I put return parts because i have so many and other ongoing items to do. 
3. I am over tasked and my managers do nothing but give more work.

I am considering leaving my current job in 2 months if nothing changes. I have made it explicit to my boss a few times that I feel overwhelmed and overworked. He basically said to share my work on our co-ops and other engineers that are new. The issue with that is that it takes time to get anyone up to speed enough to start a task and complete it from start to finish. The other issue is that I bought a house early on and I need time to save up so I could wait to get a job if I do not find another in two months. I have been working for 1.5 - 2 years. 

I did okay in school hovering around a 3.0 gpa.  I was also a very non traditional engineer. Graduating late, and not being overwhelming good with math/physics but i learned.

46,"How big a deal is efflorescence, really?",1544287307,"Hello,

In the process of trying to buy a home that's built on concrete slab. The house was built in 2006 and most inspection stuff seemed like regular wear and tear, amounting to less than ~10k. The one thing concerning us is that the seller's inspector noted ""unusual"" efflorescence in the ground floor living area in the disclosures.

We called the inspector and asked what ""unusual"" meant. He said he mainly saw it as a cosmetic thing and that it could probably be addressed by simply sealing the floor and one day down the line installing a french drain. He said it was more than he expected for a 12yo house but that could be a result of the owners putting rugs down and water not being able to evaporate off the surface. And the floor not being sufficiently sealed.

That said, I don't want to take a huge risk if there's something bigger going on. So the questions:

1. Should I be concerned about a more serious root cause? Like some type of foundation issue that's been caused by water draining improperly under the house? No cracking in walls or concrete and no uneven floors that I noticed or saw. No mildewy smell in the house. What is the worst case scenario here?
2. If I brought an engineer in for two hours, how far would that get me? My realtor recommended doing this and while I'm not concerned about the cost of the engineer, I'm concerned that the related inspection contingency could lose us the house. Would s/he actually be able to diagnose anything or make any estimates about cost to fix it? I kind of feel like you'd have to rip up concrete to get a real answer, so if it's just going to be ""seal the floor and install a french drain"" I don't want to risk the house over that.

Anyway, the machine was used to create a small plastic encased sample that can be then polished and looked at under a microscope. We cut a small piece of a piston, put it on the sample maker part of the machine and added plastic powder on top. Then a semi-sphere part was put on top to seal the sample in. And then the machine was turned on, causing the plastic to heat and melt and wrap around the sample and then cool again. Took like 10 minutes for it to finish. Then we had our metal sample surface visible on the bottom, with the black plastic encasing it on other sides.  That was then able to be polished in a different machine that was built for these round samples. After polishing it, we were able to look at it under a microscope and figure out what it was made out of by looking at the sample and reference pictures from the ""Metals Handbook; Atlas of Microstructures of Industrial Alloys"".

49,Technical work or general engineering more important for new graduate?,1544285849," Hello engineers of Reddit. I'm an kind of a good pickle for a new grad as I have gotten 2 offers at very different jobs and fields. One is as an applications engineer at a smaller local automation distributor company, and the other is a pipeline safety engineer at the state public service commission (PSC).

I guess my question is what's more beneficial for an new graduate in the engineering field? Hard technical engineering work or general work in the field you want to get into? Also how much should you take relationships into account when job picking?

My goal when I got into engineering was to work in the energy field, preferably with one of the local utilities or similar, which was why I applied to the PSC since an auditor that I know who works there says quite a few of their engineers get headhunted by utilities after a few years working there due to all the training they get sent to which really interested me. Plus you know state benefits and all being great.

However then I talked to 2 relatives who are engineers also, and they just started ranting on how the state job is just pushing papers, isn't really engineering, and everyone there is lazy. Their argument was the applications engineer job had much more broad technical experience that would be more useful, and while I do mostly agree with that I'm slightly concerned I'll be stuck in manufacturing then since all the internships were that also and won't be able to ever get into energy.

I am working on my thesis project, but I am running into some issues identifying the proper parts that I need (on a budget). What I am looking for has the essential functionality of a 2-axis linear translation stage (approximately 3-6cm of course adjustment capability). I am not working with optical products, however, and I would like to avoid ponying up the cash for one of these bad boys from Thorlabs, Newport, etc.. That being said, it is quite imperative that this solution works well because its function is central to the success of the device. So... Is there a cheaper, ready-made, solution that I am overlooking or is this my best bet? Thanks!",AskEngineers,False,52637,/r/AskEngineers/comments/a49dzf/linear_positioning_solution_help_wanted/

58,NEED ADVICE: Mechanical Engineer Major w/ Minor in Mathematics or Aerospace?,1544250068,"My career goal is to be an engineer in the aviation industry, preferably doing flight test. From the advice that I have received from former teachers and mentors, getting a mechanical engineering (ME) degree would be more useful and worth pursuing than an aerospace degree; therefore, that is what I am currently pursuing right now. I am not in my major yet and will be applying this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my dilemma: I am thinking about getting a math minor from my current school, which would only require two or three more math classes, but I recently discovered that I can get an aerospace minor at the other campus in my university. I would like to get the aerospace minor (it seems way more interesting than a math minor), but that would require me to apply and transfer to the other campus, and I do not believe that my chemistry classes transfer to the other campus. So, should I apply to the other campus and the ME major, possibly have to retake chemistry, and spend a little more time in college to get an aerospace minor? Or rather, continue to pursue a math minor at the current campus that I am at? 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that getting an aerospace minor would give me a better skillset once I get it, but this has a potential risk of spending more time and retaking one or two classes, and also hoping that I can be accepted into the ME program at that campus too.",AskEngineers,False,EzySteve206,/r/AskEngineers/comments/a48cpu/need_advice_mechanical_engineer_major_w_minor_in/

61,"Am I right to be upset? Engineering intern looking for career advice,",1544243408,"Long story short my CoOp/Internship decided to wait until today to tell me I won't have a job come January. 

&amp;#x200B;

Originally going into my last co-op term this summer I expressed I wanted to be put in a department where I could work part-time from September to May as I finish up school. I was told no problem my current department would be able to accommodate that. End of summer comes and they tell me I can only stay in that department until January but that they would have another position for me for spring. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be proactive I reach out to my HR contact in October trying to get this situated. She told me to check back in mid-November as it was 'too early to know what positions will be available"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Mid-November comes and I reach out to both her and my Co-Op advisor. My co-op advisor tells me I'm on my own and I need to reach out to managers myself to find a position. I decided to reach out to the director of engineering, and a few of my old managers. They all gave me interviews and told me they'd ask around to see what was open. Also that they would talk to my HR contact and she would keep me in the loop. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to now my HR contact finally gets back to me beating around the bush pretty much letting me know I won't have a job come January. She would for sure let me know Monday. There's an opening for an internship on the job board but since I'm graduating in May it wouldn't make sense for them to give me that position since I graduate in May.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of trying to set me up with a department for long-term, letting me take another position early fall that would allow me to stay until May, or even let me know that I should start looking for another internship they waited until today to tell me. It's a little upsetting.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm looking for advice. Should I be looking for another internship or try applying early for full-time gigs? I'm at a weird sport where it's a little early to apply for full-time positions, but also a little late to take on a new internship. Especially since I graduate in May. I would like for the internship to transition into full time but not a lot of companies are interested in that.

65,How to return internship offer without burning bridges?,1544231057,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

This past summer, I interned with a nuclear power company in the system engineering department. It was a really cool experience, and I enjoyed the workplace environment, the management, and so many other things overall. It also seemed to me that all the engineers were happy with their work and benefits, so that was also a positive. The company offered me a returning internship for Summer 2019 at a plant nearby the one I worked at last summer. I accepted it (this was back in September, they only gave me 1 week to decide) since I thought it would be great to really cement my spot in the company - they hire 50% of their interns.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is where the issue lies. An opportunity has come about for me to study abroad in Germany this summer, at TU Darmstadt, one of the top-ranked German universities. The program is about automotive engineering, which also interests me. I could potentially go for free since I also received a bunch of scholarships (\~$6500). I really want to study abroad, but that would mean I have to return my internship offer. I spoke to my former manager, and he said that he would not personally hold anything against me, and encouraged me to try something new this summer. However, the company is very large and has corporate HR so I need to contact them, not my former manager.

&amp;#x200B;

Could anyone please advise me on how to proceed? I think the study abroad opportunity is once in a lifetime, and would have a large impact on my professional development. I would also like to potentially get a job at the company in the future though, so how can I back out without ruining my chances?

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: I accepted an internship offer that I would now like to return, since I have the opportunity for a fully-funded engineering study abroad program. I could use some advice on how to play my cards right.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I am a junior, so this is most likely the last summer i could study abroad or intern anywhere.

82,Why hydraulic over pneumatic in this situation?,1544197109,"My company offers a fairly simple system that uses a total of about five pneumatic actuators of various sizes.  We supply an accumulator tank so the customer only needs to supply ~80 psig compressed air to our connection, and everything is basically good to go.  We also use the air for various other things such as sight glass cleaning of a burner, or some sensing lines.  For unconditioned air we can easily provide a dryer to prevent freezing in cold climates.  For customers w/out compressed air, we can include a compressor.  Even adding the dryer and compressor is fairly cheap.

Well, we have a customer who, for apparent maintenance reasons, does not like pneumatics.  They want hydraulics.  This is in an area where freezing is not going to happen.  It also means they need a containment pad in case of hydraulic fluid leakage.  Especially since the equipment is going on a roof.

What am I missing here?  Is there some advantage here to providing a full hydraulic power unit, containment pad, etc., all for a five actuators?  (Once they see the cost this will probably all blow over, but my curiosity is piqued).

Now, the total drag force will be less, but I plan to gradually increase the area of the fin until the drag force for the 3 fin almost equates to the 4 fin drag values. From there, I could compare the cost/weight of one design to another and determine which would be cheaper/lighter.

To do so requires towing a model in a towing tank and then moving the model in sway, yaw and a combination of the both (Called a horizontal planar motion mechanism). In 1987, someone at the university made a HPMM by connecting a DC motor to a cog, which rotates a larger cog, which rotates a belt drive to move the model. The belt drive is connected to a potentiometer to feed to the control system to measure the movement. There are two motors, belts and potentiometers so that you can move the bow and stern in and out of phase with each other.  


The HPMM hasn't been used in 10 years and has been stripped of parts. Also, the original code was written in DOS. There is a brand new towing tank at the university so I think I will be able to get funding to do a complete overhaul. I am thinking of using two servo motors, each with their respective control units and amplifiers instead of the potentiometer-DC motor set up. However, I have no idea how to set a servo up and how to control it (Can I control it in MatLab?). I'm trying to find videos online but I can't find a way to make it so that I can create an application, so a user can enter speed control, the phase difference between the bow and stern, amplitude of motion, etc and then for the servo to perform that motion.

My GPA wasn't the best (&lt;3.0), but I graduated nonetheless.  In that time, I've applied to countless jobs, gone on a fair number of interviews, and have yet to find a job.

I've asked myself more times than I could possibly remember why it still hasn't worked out yet, but I think it's fairly safe to say that my concentration didn't exactly help.  I did a concentration in what was supposed to teach us the entrepreneurial side of the tech world.  What this amounted to in practice was that, for my technical electives in my junior and senior years, where most engineering students are taking highly specialized advanced level courses and really sharpening their skills, I was taking classes at the business school instead.  I suppose any business experience is useful, but it wasn't exactly useful for the purposes of finding an entry level engineering job.

I got a job waiting tables at a local restaurant right after I graduated, just to keep my head above water in the meantime, and to save for my student loan payments.  Since my loans have started kicking in, I've sometimes had to work 50-60 hour weeks just to pay off my loans and other bills.

I can graduate in the spring of 2020, but I'm realizing that I don't enjoy microbiology, let alone biology anymore. It seems that the majority of my schooling is just constant memorization; there is little to no problem solving. The fact that everything is so vague really irritates me. I am someone who has to know every little for why something operates the way it does or how it operates. Everything in biology is very topical; it doesn't go into the specifics. For example, bacteria can exchange genetic information (conjugation) with one another through a tube (pili) that connects one to another. However, what bothers me is the how. How does this work? Where is this tube when it isn't being used? How does it attach to the other bacteria? How does the DNA get incorporated? How does the DNA know where to go? I often feel like I leave being more confused and frustrated since I don't know the minute details. Is this a quality that would excel in the engineering field? I guess this quality goes hand-in-hand with being very analytical. I like to run through every option for something and try to see things from every angle that is possible? Is this a good quality for engineering?

My main question would be the intelligence threshold for engineering? I am by no means someone that is incredibly intelligent; I am incredible average; I'm not some genius. I have attended a community college for last 5 semesters that is ranked #39 out of the 868 community colleges across the United States. I have managed to get by with all A's with not much difficulty; this includes in my highest math class: calculus I, which wasn't too difficult. I did have to apply effort to this class, but it wasn't as horrible as people make it seem.

Sorry about this long-winded post. I'm just someone that really needs to think things through logically from every possible angle. I don't want to attend if it wouldn't be right for me, or if I don't have the intelligence.

I'd like to be able to run numbers on different insulating materials, combinations of materials, etc, without having to actually build them, fill them with ice, and set them in the sun with a timer.

Most of the materials I'm interested in using have data sheets online. I was hoping to be able to take those data points and get a rough idea of heat rise based on external ambient temperature, and the introduction of heat through the copper tubing from cooling the fresh water.

37,Building a servo setup to mimic a weight-driven cable,1544110624,"Not totally sure if this is the right sub for this.

So I wanted a weight-driven cable machine for gym use, a generic example is linked to here (https://goo.gl/images/aiEgHh). Only these machine cost thousands of dollars and weight a lot, so I figured I could build one that mimics the function with an electric motor.

I don’t know a ton about this sort of thing but from basic research it looks like I could have a servo attached to a pulley. The servo would always try to move to the home position of the pulley pulled all the way in. It looks like I could have a dial or arduino setup to control the amount of torque on the servo.

So my questions are:

Am I going about this right, or is this the totally wrong way to do this?

Would the servo be able to provide a stable torque regardless of servo position?

What type of servo would be best for this?

(Curious if the “career outcomes” are reasonable)

http://www.ccsu.edu/mcm/RoboticsMechEngrTechBS.html

I’m encouraged by the built in internship. The reason I really like this degree is it teaches a lot of things I want to learn anyway. I found myself very excited for school because of this degree. I love the hybrid nature of mechatronics and would love to analyze needs, design, manufacture, and program automation systems and other electromechanical systems like 3d printers. I also think applying what I learn and using it for real world results would keep me motivated more than pure theory. I could see myself using what I learn in personal projects a lot.

Once I started looking at the implications of “technology” that all kind of fell apart. It is ABET ETAC accredited.  I’m afraid to go through a 4 year degree and not be employable.

I've considered a digital calliper which would get around this problem however that would mean it actually coming into contact with the figurine which risks moving it slightly, voiding the result of the game.

I've considered a laser meter, however these all seem to be for architectural purposes and would not give an accurate enough result (it can be 1mm or less that makes the difference), plus perhaps would not work properly on a figurine as apposed to a flat surface.

57,A job I estimated is being done terribly wrong without consulting me by another engineer and they are trying to pin the blame on be for the lost money. How can I protect myself against this?,1544048609,"Two months ago my boss gave me an estimate to do: we were given a scientific calculator in excel form and we needed to convert it to a web application.

I found a way to convert the original file without changing the formulas and thus avoiding the absolute pain of having to re-write everything from scratch. I gave him my estimate for the job (roughly 100hs) and that was the end of it.

Three weeks ago my boss gave this job to a coworker of mine that had never done anything like this before. However, my boss didn't say anything to me about this, he never told me to support him, he never even consulted with me. And my coworker totally ignored me and went ahead by himself without event saying a word to me about the job nor asking me what my idea was. I took the hint and let it go.

One week later, my coworker was furious. ""How the f* did he estimated this job? What the hell is wrong with him? How is this possible? This is impossible to do in this time frame..."". All this behind my back. My boss then realized this guy wasn't gonna make it so he told yet another coworker to support him in this job.

The new girl on the team was given a brief introduction by the guy and she immediately flipped out. She started saying the same things this guy was saying, and in addition, she admitted she never did anything like this before so she couldn't be expected to deliver. Also, she slipped this to my boss: ""I don't know how steve estimates these things... I think he did it without even opening the project on the basis he wasn't going to develop it himself...""

Now the kick. Neither of these two asked me squat. They only complained when I wasn't in the room or to my boss in private (I have a friend in the office who overheard all of this). Now they used all the hours just to analyze that damn calculator, and you know why they are failing? Because they are trying to rewrite it from scratch, the very thing I tried to avoid.

The year is almost over. I still have two weeks and then I'm on leave. The project *will never be done in time*, and I'm being framed as the guy who ""made up an estimate out of the blue"". **And nobody is asking me what I was thinking, neither my boss nor my coworkers**

76,"How can I determine whether a drill battery pack needs ""rejuvenation"", or whether one of the batteries is dead? How do I replace batteries in battery packs for drills and laptops, and how do I make sure they are ""in sync""?",1544026136,"Hey guys!



I know this is a lot of questions, so let's start from the beginning and see what we can figure out. I'm talking about your standard 18650 li ion batteries that go everywhere. I know you can solder them or zap them industrially, that's no problem. My problems are the following:



1. When I have a dead battery pack for a drill, and the charger is so old that the lamp that it's charging means nothing, and you can't determine whether it won't take charge, or whether a battery exploded and it physically can't take charge, how do I determine that? Open the thing, and find the two poles, and then measure because the microchip might be interfering for whatever reason, and if I get no charge, that means a bettery is dead? 





2. Do I need to cut out all the batteries from the pack, and measure them separately, or can I do it somehow while connected?






3. Do I charge all the batteries somehow before putting the pack together? or does it not matter for a drill pack?




4. Can I just keep the industrially zapped parts on the batteries, and solder them back together in the middle, instead of breaking thme off, and soldering a new strap to the battery?




5. For laptop batteries, I hear there is a slightly serious thing, and there is a measure device between each battery connection, so it can see the health of the battery and whatnot. I heard it is important for batteries to be ""synched"", so that they discharge all together, and that it never happens that the middle one is dead or discharges super fast, and the other two are full. How to insure this? Let's say I am rebuilding a laptop battery, and I just buy 3 new ones. Do I need to charge them or discharge them, or measure their dicharge rate (Is this really necessary?).




So yea, I wanna know more about this stuff. All the drill videos only show you how to upgrade from small batteries to the 18650 ones, or how to ""rejuvenate"" a dead pack by connecting + to+ and - to - with another battery pack, so the charger recognizes the pack.




I also wanna know about the dangers of replacing laptop batteries. Mine suck, and are even integrated in the laptop case, so it's not like oyu can take out a pack and have your way with it, so I wanna do everything right. I thought aobut expanding my load, by adding a second battery parallelly to each of the 3 or 4 ones, but I hear that the microchip might go crazy because of the extra capacity. I dunno. please advise!

Just for shits and grins I dropped in an application because I have a friend at that facility who seems to enjoy it. As of today I've scheduled my second interview for Wednesday of next week but the problem is, is that I'm starting to have second thoughts about this new job because I have no complaints about my current job. This job has also been open for quite some time so I wonder what the reason is (these interviews have also progressed fairly quickly).

My current company treats me very well (paying for my masters, and sending me to any training I request) and I love the people I work with but the work experience I'm getting here really isn't what I studied at all. My major was Power Systems engineering and I'm currently doing mostly project management with a bit of controls engineering on the side. I can see a bright future ahead of me here if I stay so I feel like I'm giving something up if I change jobs.

I figure I'll go through with the interviews and see what they offer but I'm thinking that I'll probably turn it down. I'm not even sure what dollar amount would make it worth it to me.

There are two gains, one related to the input command and one related to the sensor output. What do these mean for the controller model? How does that relate to the system response? 

After trying a bunch of different gain combinations I feel like one of these gains is more closely related to the sensitivity of the system to the error and the other gain determines the strength of the corrective response. This seems easy enough to tune and implement but I have had a hard time finding gains that yield a stable response.

I am a ME student currently looking at some different options with what I can do with the rest of my time at college. I am currently a junior so for my final Summer before graduation so I need to decide whether to take a CoOp or do another internship.
Previously, I had taken a few ""Engineering Intern"" positions, but both were cases where I was not working alongside an actual engineer, helping them with what they did. It was more ""Intern"" stuff like changing the format of how the company set up their AutoCad files. I am also involved in a student Org, but I have been doing things which are not, from my understanding, typically done by a ME, C programming on a micro controller.
While what I have is certainly something, it clearly isn't the equivalent of the kind of experience that something coming out of school with a CoOp with Tesla would have which is why I am trying to make my final time here look the best as possible. I either have the option of taking a CoOp and finishing in 4.5 years or taking an internship, possibly getting a leadership position in my club, and finishing on time. 
Just looking for opinions from people on what companies are looking for out of new graduates. And suggestions on what I should do would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for spending your time to read all of this.

I applied to an internal position and got an offer for 97k (14% raise).  The position would be a step up - I would go from being a plant automation engineer to managing small teams (3-4 other members) for automation projects across the whole company.  

The problem is, I would be moving to a much higher COL area.  The property tax and insurance increase would set me back about 7k per year based on the price range of homes I would be looking for.  I also expect to receive the same raise if I keep my current job after one more year there.  I would effectively lose money if I accepted this offer.  

I plan to counter offer and ask for an additional 7k to cover the increased COL.  At the same time, I'm accepting a team leader position and moving on from a job that's lower stress.  I would have to ask for at least another 3k just so I get SOME sort of financial incentive.  

All in all, I end up countering with a salary of 106k.  This is a 25% raise compared to the 14% raise that was offer.

23,Seeking work/social advice for someone who wants to work in aerospace by age 40,1543887168,"Whee, another topic about switching careers in your middle years. I haven't been in college for a while, and it's crazy how much time flies. I started studying architecture in late 2001 (just before 9/11) then dropped it for art, got a degree in New Media which sounds like a flavor of the month is because it was, chasing trends. As a result, many of the computer-based art classes were not grounded well in foundations. I was really just learning how to use a particular tool. Or in the case of web programming, learning functions and syntax without the core foundations that a Computer Science major would provide.

Still I was able to teach myself C++ and PHP and do some cool projects with them during college. I didn't apply for internships so my ""strategy"" for finding work was applying to any relevant local companies I could find on Craigslist. I don't use CL anymore but every job hunt has been the same. Apply to jobs cold, no referrals or connections. I don't really burn bridges with companies but I didn't build any strong bridges with them either. That started working against me.

I have a mindset problem. I got too complacent with my work. The companies were small but I didn't take any initiative to do more work than what was requested. 1st year of my career I was responding to support tickets, fixing bugs, cranking out code, and the 9th year of my career it's more or less the same. I don't make any major impacts for the company, I seldom drive the work conversation, and willingness to take on more responsibility like running code reviews, mentoring junior developers, writing really good documentation, participate in planning and architecture discussions, etc.

With that being the case, even in a field such as web development where there's no shortage of jobs and high demand, I am no longer getting through to companies big or small for job offers. I'm not competitive enough anymore. I have no problems getting job interviews but my offer rate is roughly 1 per 1000 applications. Combine that with repeated layoffs and I find myself in a begging state, not affording to hold out for good offers. I'm paying some debt and constantly find myself living paycheck to paycheck.

So I'm going for the other option, going around it with my other career interest, in aerospace. I don't know yet if I'd rather go into Aerospace Engineering, Computer Eng. or Electrical, but my career goal would be to hold down a profession within the aerospace industry. I feel washed up as a software developer anyways, few people actually reach out to me for work, as I don't really build strong work relationships. Even personal relationships are lacking- my friends don't work in tech, I don't talk to most of them anymore. I am not married nor have a partner to support me financially. I live with my mom now because I can no longer afford my own place to live.

I know fixing these problems is not as simple as just changing careers to solve my personal and financial problems. I need to fix my complacent mindset, start building a network in college, get good internships, etc. (I really slept on networking and regret it). About the thread title- I am 36 right now but if I re-entered college in 2019, I would guess I'd be around 40 when I graduate.

24,Advice: how to/should I ask to be relocated from a manufacturing site to HQ?,1543886633,"Hello, 

I recently started my first engineering job at a great company 6 months ago. My girlfriend of one year also works for this company, but at their HQ whereas I work at a manufacturing site approximately 2.5 hours away. 

In April, the company does evaluations and they generally ask you about your career interests. Would it be too soon to ask whether I could be considered for a role at the HQ for my next job? This company generally keeps each person in their roles for 1-1.5 years (depending on the position. Senior positions stay a bit longer). Generally, people begin moving to HQ from a manufacturing site 2-3 roles in, if they prefer.

So it wouldn’t necessarily be expediting a role change, but I’m not sure if this would be a bad move for my career. I don’t want my asking to come across as a threat that I’ll quit. If I need to have a second role at my site before being considered for a move, that would be fine just kind of a bummer since I’d like my relationship to move forward. (Plus I think I’d enjoy the jobs at HQ more than the roles offered on site).

What is the best way to approach this? Is this something I can bring up, or should I just wait?

Also, one of the requirements for getting your PE is working under a PE for 4 years (at least in my state) along with having other PE references who know you in a professional capacity. How do you go about meeting that requirement and making those connections since they must be references who have worked with you. I guess I'm asking how do you get PE references if you aren't really working with any PE's?

- Have a full-time job lined up as a draftsman/designer, currently in same position but part-time
- I am debt free and refuse to take out any loans. 
- I live 50 miles from university so depending on the semester I (should be ) commuting 2-4 times a week, 200-400 miles a week on my older car. Ive been commuting for two years for college alone and its taken a toll. 
- Mechanical engineering Major at UCF
- 1-2 classes before senior status
- 2.8 GPA
- Ive been a part time student for the last 3 years, I’ve been in college for 6. 
- Full time and part time work throughout the last 3 years
- Before transfering to university, at community college was getting A’s in Calculus and Diff Eq
- Never got a well deserved A or B in any physics based class( that is Ive earned plenty of B’s with curves) 
- At the university level Ive only earned A’s in programming and statistics which I also fine interesting (leaning towards industrial or CS)
- This semester I took two engineering classes that in theory I love but didnt plan for life to happen so Ive severely fallen behind in both classes. Im very angry with myself for not “picking up my bootstraps” and just trying harder. I tried but I am burnt out. Ive been part time everything for a long ass time and being spread thin fucking sucks. I don’t want to give up so I thought of some paths I could take but Im not sure what path to take. 
- Also, Im not 100% sure about mechanical engineering. I like it and I know Ill be good at it at some point. I like programming and I even program drafting automation macros at work. I enjoy binary trees and Big O analysis stuff too. But thats only from taking a data structures and algorithms course so I don’t know what the rest of a computer science degree really entails. 

So Im here for advice from those in the field or who have supported themselves while going to college on what path to take.

Should I
- Take one online elective, work full-time and evaluate my life and career direction
- Give college a break, go hard at work full-time and evaluate my life and career direction
- Switch to a fully online ABET accredited engineering technology program and take one online class a semester and never worry about transportation as far as school goes. I know Im smart enough for the BSME but the BSET seems to be a better fit logistically.  

Ive considered moving closer to university but I have a good job and don’t want to risk a worse job in order to finish.

- Needs to work full time
- Max course load is one class a semester
- No commute is Highly preferred

The roller housing prevents the bearings from coming out too far to fall off the roller, even if the press fit fails to contain the bearings, so I'm not worried about cold creep allowing the bearing to move a little axially, however, I want to keep the bearing close to concentric with the hole for bearing performance.  


Currently my print calls out a ±.001"" tolerance for the bearing bore. My supplier has informed me that this is too tight of a tolerance for UHMW. While they want ±.03"" on all dimensions, they acknowledge that this is too loose for a bearing bore. 

&amp;#x200B;

From my research, ±.005"" is a more appropriate tolerance for UHMW. My bearing is +.0000/ -.0005"".

&amp;#x200B;

What size bearing bore should I use with a ±.005 tolerance? Should I size the hole to nominally be .0055"" below the nominal bearing ø to guarantee line-to-line at worst case?

The company is making a lot of money from these clients and I’ve been recently assigned a lot of important projects on that front.

Our team is composed of the best the company has to offer so we are under pressure a lot. Two weeks ago I warned one of the owners that I would have to do over time to meet the deadlines. The reason was he brought to the table a new assignment and it had to be done in parallel to the rest.

He said it was ok. Deadlines were met, projects delivered and I even went over what was expected of me and improved overall performance on all our applications.

Today he told me there was an incomming project I couldn’t do because he did’t want me to do overtime.

There are a few things off here:

- First of all, the company has money to pay us.

- Second, the overtime allowed him to keep happy three different clients and improve a process that sucked (my code is constantly being re-used by my coworkers on other projects, jesus...)

- Third, one evening he complained about me doing overtime without being paid and told me to ask for OT. I did, and now he’s telling me not to do OT anymore.

- Finally, I’m giving his company my best, taking care of business like no other and I love my job, so why does he prefer for me to step down and stop? OT also allows me to be paid more given the fact *I work more*, and he wants me to sto *working more*...

That’s what bothers me. It’s like he doesn’t see how much I’m bringing to the table. He would prefer to tell a client complaining that “they have to settle for a slow product” instead of paying me extra to make it faster...

What’s wrong here? Why doesnt he let me do as I please if what I do brings only benefit to the company?

I am an undergrad in Environmental Engineering, although I worked last summer as a Mining Engineer and have a strong interest in Gold Mining. Independent of my University, I have been working on and experimenting with a novel method in gravity separation processes in gold concentration (Removing rare and expensive gold from worthless minerals). While I am not using professional equipment and cutting edge technology to test my prototype, all my results so far have supported my hypothesis that this idea will increase efficiency and the recovery rates of gold. (As a note, I have spoken to a family friend confidentially who is a IP lawyer and they are confident that this idea is protectable. Also, I have spent many hours reading books, journals, articles, and the internet, and have not come across anything resembling my idea. Furthermore, I have spoken with a gold miner I worked for who thinks it is a solid idea that has a lot of potential)

&amp;#x200B;

My question though is about what I should do with this. To me, it seems like an incredible challenge to actually build a machine and be able to market it to consumers (professional gold miners). I have no expertise in anything but engineering, and as a start-up idea, I think it is more difficult than I imagine to be successful in this field. So that leaves me with the option of researching the topic through my school (assuming I would be able to receive funding for it). As far as I know, doing this would forfeit any possible claim I could make about owning the IP behind the product. But there definitely are benefits to studying/researching this through my school instead of trying to build a business idea behind it. Primarily, if I failed to make a business out of it, I would be left with nothing (besides the experience). The failure could also be independent of how good of an idea it is; I could fail by not having good marketing, quality assurance, etc. However, if I were to research this through my University, I would have documented work that is novel and impressive. Also, in this scenario, there is no downside of failure (assuming that the idea proves fruitful, which seems likely).

My plant is going to be a simppe inverted pendulum that I'm trying to accurately measure and actuate to keep it upright. Only problem is, I haven't taken any linear systems classes or anything (I'm an EE major).

The only articles or videos I find describe their pendulums with Two separate masses. One for a simple cart that has four wheels driving it, and one for the weighted end that is to be balanced (with a 'weightless' beam connecting it to the cart).

I realize this is a 2 DOF plant, as it can only move in the X axis and in the pitch axis (theta).

My troubles begin with finding the euler Lagrange, and converting to an accurate representation of the equations of Motion.

Afterwards, would you recommend using state space representation or transfer functions (PID)?

So, the payload is an APRS packet which is clearly visible on the [IQ spectrogram](https://imgur.com/g4c8r03) (small segment about 300kHz below hw frequency).

I've demodulated the FM signal into [this](https://imgur.com/VBuX3O0), with this [spectrogram](https://imgur.com/tuEOds2).

My issue is that I don't quite know what the correct way is to isolate the packet. My guesses so far:

1. Filter out the time window based on the IQ PSD. In the raw data it seems that the packet peaks in power in my band. I guess I could filter any samples with power over the mean power of the 200kHz band. However, computing the PSD over so many windows at 8MHz sampling rate is quite expensive, and I'd rather avoid it.

2. In the demodulated signal, it seems that my packet actually has a lower power that the noise, and I don't know why that is (nor if I should rely on this behaviour). I tried looking for plateaus in the derivative of the mean power (basically assuming that the transmitter will output somewhat constant power), and while this seems to work, I don't trust this as I don't understand the underlying principles.

86,How ECU calculates fuel efficiency,1543787935,"I understand it takes into account the current fuel usage (duty cycle x cylinders) which is based on RPM and load demand (TPS), right? But I believe speed is also a factor in calculating L/100km. 

The injectors are firing fuel into the cylinders, ok, but how fast you go over those 100km ultimately determines how much fuel will end up being injected at the rate that they are injecting (which is based on rpm and load). Correct?

So revving while holding still gives infinite L/100km, because you will never traverse the 100km.  Going slowly  while injecting X amount of fuel would give 25L/100km, while going fast and injecting that same amount of fuel would give 5L/100km, simply due to fact you will traverse the 100km faster and thus overall use less fuel. Is that fair to say?

So to implement an instantaneous fuel efficiency, the ECU would need duty cycle rate, and speed (lets say distance traveled in 1s ticks). (perhaps more factors would be necessary as well?)

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is though, is it possible in any way to calculate L/100km WITHOUT using speed, i.e is speed (distance over time) an integral part of the calculation.

Age 28 male, civil engineering degree, have passed the FE exam. Currently reside in the US Florida, working as a transmission line engineer for a power company.

Background: I spent 3 years in the military before my current job. Did not get a lot of relevant engineering experience, so I feel a bit behind, and I also have lofty career goals

Current: after my military stint, I found a job as a transmission line engineer for one of the larger coops in the nation (About 400 employees). I have now been here about 20 months. I started with 60k, and am now making 67k. Management really likes me, and has talked about moving me to a supervisor position of another group once the current supervisor retires.

Goals: move up as quickly as possible. Eventually want to reach the C suite somewhere. At my current company, the requirements for the director of electrical operations requires 10 years engineering experience, as well as 10 years management experience. That would put me 46 by the time I’m even eligible, and the 10 years as an engineer will initially keep my salary a lot lower than I would like in the short term. The 10 years engineering experience also means I wouldn’t be eligible for the Director position if I got the Supervisor position.

Things I’m doing to try and reach my goals: taking the PE exam in April, and considering either a part time MBA, or full time (which would be for a career switch initially to management consulting, then to an upper management position at a large company or stay and try to make partner). If I opt for the part time MBA, I would hope to get the supervisor position in  2-4 years, then jump to another company every 3-4 years to a higher level of management in power companies.

8,Question of fan placement and direction of airflow for a laptop cooler that I am building for my laptop which has no apparent separate cooling intake vents at the bottom?,1543734387,"Hello, 

It does seem like an electronics gadget related question but I believe that it comes down to basic thermodynamics because of how peculiar my laptop is.

I am looking into making a laptop cooler for myself and I have a few questions about the fan placement and direction.

The laptop I own is a HP-AY516TX. It has the following [underside configuration](https://i.postimg.cc/6qn3JgDW/laptop-underside.png) with the area that gets heated most under heavy use highlighted in red. It has the [cooling vents](https://i.postimg.cc/MpdGSyrQ/vent-and-description.png) on the left side of the highlighted are in the previous picture with no apparent intake anywhere on the laptop. Some say that HP makes laptops take air from the keyboard but I have no idea if that's true or even possible. I believe that some part of the [fan systems](https://i.postimg.cc/9fkF4c2X/cooling-unit-inside.jpg) allows air inside and cools the heating tube. 

I want to build a cooling system for this from stuff I have lying around at home(12V,120mm DC fans and a lot of wood planks). The question that has been nagging me, however is that I want to know how to place these fans and in which direction should they push air?

As far as my understanding goes, Laptop cooling pads are designed to push air into intake vents on the bottom to make it effective. Since my laptop doesn't have intake vents my solution would be to cool the base and that in turn cools the components below.

**Case 1 : Blowing air onto the base of the laptop**

I decided to check out how effective it would be to cool the base of the laptop. I borrowed a 5V DC fan cooling pad that pushes air onto the laptop underside and tried to place it just beneath the hot area with adequate clearance to allow air to hit the base and move outwards. These are the [results](https://i.postimg.cc/CMrHFQzF/Speed-Fan-Output.png). Note : the fan was really slow and didn't offer much directed airflow at the hot area and I really tried to optimize the placement as much possible.

With this it seems that if I increase the fan speed with the 120mm fans by running them at 9V and place them directly below the heated area I might be able to decrease the temperatures further (say to 60 C) and allow the laptop to perform better. 

**Case 2 : Pulling air from beneath the laptop**

The idea here would be to pull air from underneath the laptop and and push it downwards which would then be directed outwards at angle. Unfortunately, this isn't something I've been able to test so I can't say how effective this is and googling for answers led me to this [page](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july32015/index.html). Here they detail that if you want to cool a large area you will have to push air out and if you want to cool a small area you will have to push air onto it. 

So, this has got me confused and further googling hasn't given me any satisfactory answers as to which method would be most effective for my laptop.

Summary of questions :
* Pushing air onto the laptop chassis or pulling air from it? Which is more effective?
* Should I look at cooling the whole laptop or just the heated area? How would I go about it? Any preliminary designs or ideas I can build upon?",AskEngineers,False,invertTheEntropy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/a2b9qo/question_of_fan_placement_and_direction_of/

I was told that if he received a sufficient headcount later this year, he would let me leave in January. He recieved the headcount he was looking for then told me I was going to have to wait until July.

I went to executive management about this and the executive manager is supporting the July transfer date.

So I graduated back in May, took the summer off and started looking for a job in September. I'm in Toronto just fyi. after doing some interviews I have 2 job offers that I need to respond to by Monday and I need some help in evaluating them in terms of both the jobs themselves and also future career prospects.

&amp;#x200B;

offer 1: Mechanical Engineer EIT

this one is at a mid size engineering firm (about 140 employees) in Toronto. I'd be doing HVAC system design for Commercial projects mainly on Revit and other responsibilities that come with that like load calculation, duct sizing, etc.

They are offering me $56K/y plus an annual bonus for overtime, health, dental, and vision, RRSP matching, life and disability insurance etc.

The company has mostly good reviews on Glassdoor. I know the future job prospects for this career would be senior engineer and then most likely moving on to a managerial position. The only thing I'm skeptical about is that I don't want to get stuck in the HVAC industry as I've heard it can be hard to get out of if one tries to change career paths.

&amp;#x200B;

offer 2: Production Planner

This is at a larger size manufacturing company (200-500 Employees) that makes pet products, dog and cat food and mainly manufactures kitty litter in Canada. They told me I'd be responsible for managing their Bentonite (used in manufacturing cat litter) supply chain through out US and Canada to make sure things run smoothly. I was told the job would include some process engineering and planning as well as coordinating with suppliers, transportation etc.

They are offering me $62K/y plus health,dental, and life and disability insurance.

the company has some questionable Glassdoor reviews mainly for poor management and working conditions and high staff turnover. I don't know this business at all so I don't know what future career paths would be but from what I can guess it would move up to managing supply and manufacturing and later on maybe operations or possibly moving towards the business side of things instead of engineering (maybe get an MBA)?

61,When you love Hardware but don't like to code...?,1543569544,"I'll save you guys a bunch of backstory and just say I flopped around a lot with choosing my focus on what to study. And this post isn't about that. But I am basically at the crossroads point in school and I have realized a malevolent truth. *I don't like coding, at all.* 

I now go to school here in Seattle and meet *so* many software guys. Not only had the prestige worn off to me. Especially since they are so common here, But I talk and socialize with them on the regular. Especially amazon and microsoft workers since thats most my social circle here since I met most my friends through tech guys. And most them have.. little soul it seems like. They just code and code and code, like drones. I see the kids at UDub when I come out of class coding away like zombies. And furthermore I myself just started studying two years ago. These kids have been coding since teens and some before then!

I know not even the rudiments compared to them. Especially the all the Koreans here at UDub, they are on another planet. So not only do I not enjoy it, I am not good at it, at all. It really hurt my confidence too. 

Moreover, I got into engineering because I love hardware. I may not have been coding since a teen, but since I was 12 I have been building PCs, learned to overclock at 13, GPU tweaking, modding, and kept up to date with the latest specs on ever intel chip from sandy to kaby. Participated in almost every war between AMD and NVIDIA online, and more! I used to have a burning passion for tech. But now I arrive in 2018 and almost **everything** is about software and coding. 

I understand hardware stuff is drying up and has been. But is there nothing I can pursue to regain my passion again where I won't have to code as much or atleast be able to interact with actual hardware on a more tangible level?

**TLDR** 
I don't like coding at all, and I realized I have no talent in it at all compared to my peers here in Seattle at this rigorous program. Do I have to deal with forcing myself to love to learn code? Or do you guys know of a career pathway that I can delve into hardware with that has but a modicum of coding? I know hardware gigs are scare now, and code is apart of everything but I am struggling to even stay motivated to study because I know I am going to end up with a job I don't like since I don't like coding.

Basically, my first assignments there were to cross reference dimensions on older prints from AutoCAD and SolidWorks and make sure the dimensions are matching accordingly. This I did with ease of course. After doing this for 5 weeks, they finally gave me my own project to which required me to take a SolidWorks drawing and re-do it in AutoCAD. I told my manager that ""I didn't have much experience in AutoCAD."" Before hiring me, he insisted ""that'll be okay, it doesn't differ too much from SolidWorks."" I. Beginning to notice that's true for the most part, but overall it takes me twice as long to do a simple drawing. How could I make sure to get my AutoCAD experience up at a relaistic rate? Another problem is the engineer that I'm suppose to report to has visibly shown that me asking him for help is kind of bother to him, so I limit my questions, which requires me to use forums and YouTube tutorials which takes more time. How to overcome these obsticales to not get fired. 

(I take too long to finish projects, the engineer who I'm suppose to ask questions to doesn't seem like he wants to be stuck with the engineering intern, which then makes me take longer, and makes the manager displeased, help?)

From what I've read and heard there is no single right way and the tests will account for you strongly agreeing with things like ""my work ethic is a main focus of mine"" over and over again. I also feel bad whenever I answer a question as ""NOTA, or Neutral"" since I feel like I'm just throwing away the question.

93,Engineer trying to decide to take a job.,1543519311,"Hey everyone. So recently I interviewed and visited this company that I was applying for. the position is a process engineering position for a chemical company that makes a variety of chemicals. My understanding is that my daily tasks are to write written procedures to make these chemicals (like in lab at school), while on occasion I will be given other tasks to find parts, edit other documents, and possibly work on cleaning procedures. It also seems that a lot of starting engineers only stay 1 to 2 year and then leave for another position. I guess it would be a good starting company working in my state Oklahoma so I am near family, but I am wondering if its worth while to take up the opportunity, leave after a year or bite the bullet and find another company that I want to work at.

94,Can eBay style bidding be encoded as a linear programming constraint?,1543517070,"Just as a preface this isn't a homework question but a real world situation on a software project I'm working on.

Say I have a linear programming problem with a decision variable Xi, (i from 0 to n). Xi represents the bid set for a user in an auction where all users are bidding against each other. Each user has a maximum bid Yi (i from 0 to n).

In this scenario I want to maximize the sum of all the bids but the bids should behave like an auction.

One obvious constraint is that Xi &lt;= Yi for all i. That is, each bid is less than or equal to the user's max bid.

The other constraint is that users shouldn't bid more than necessary. For example if the max bids are 1, 2, and 3, the resultant decision variables should be 1, 2, and (2 + d), where d is the minimum increase to outbid someone.

What I'm having trouble with is figuring out is it possible to encode this second constraint using linear equations/equalities? I can't seem to figure out how to formulate it.

Or have I somehow ended up with a nonlinear problem here?

TL;DR: Title

I started a maths degree in September and I'm not really enjoying it to be truthful. I've looked into a mechanical engineering degree and it sounds like I'd be better suited towards it but I'd like to know what kind of work it consists of (e.g. is there more calculus, or more geometry, etc).

Figured I should also add that I do meet the course requirements and my A-level subjects were Maths, Biology, and Chemistry but I enjoy physics as well.

96,Seeking some advice on wanting to switch careers to Electrical Engineering,1543516029,"Hi all,

This is probably my first reddit post aside from reading up on various topics from r/engineering and r/space. 

I was looking for some advice for a current pickle I'm in. Warning, this might be a wall of text.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23, almost 24, married with two kids. I went to school initially for physics but was bummed out at the prospects outside of academia, took a break and got into the work force at 20. Fast forward, I'm currently in IT working as a network technician and while the work is fun and granular and requires math, I recently discovered (perhaps a little too late) that engineering is something I should have gone into for immediate prospects after college. 

&amp;#x200B;

My conundrum should be pretty apparent now; I have a family and two younger kids and I'm the main source of income currently. I've already come to the conclusion that being a student full-time is definitely out of the cards for me. That being said, I would like to go back to school and pursue electrical engineering. The farthest I went for math was Calculus 2 and to this day I still practice here and there on testing my aptitude for math so that it doesn't diminish. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some colleges allow you to work with the university and have some extra financial help, but that still wouldn't change that I couldn't go to school except part time as full-time is unreasonable, as daycare costs are so high that my wife stays home to mitigate that cost. I also would probably raise a few eyebrows if I was to work as a network tech/network engineer at a university just to get an Electrical Engineering degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to go back and go for this degree, but that opportunity may be long past by now, which if that's the case, I can at least say I'm somewhat content in my field now. I'm just not in a position to take risks right now due to obligations and accountability.

97,Engineering graduate looking for alternative career,1543514693,"Hi all,

I graduated with a BASc in mechanical engineering (top ranked Canadian school) last year and I was wondering if I could get some guidance for some alternative career paths. 

In school I enjoyed solid mechanics and some failure analysis type work and generally really didn't enjoy electrical or programming related. Ive worked design jobs for internships and overall I didn't enjoy the screen staring or repetitiveness of it. 

I tend to have good soft skills, I'm personable, Im pretty good at writing reports, I don't mind data analysis (though programming is something I know very little about). I also have personal interests in psychology and law as well. 

I guess what I'm asking is what kind of careers would maybe be better suited for someone with those skills and interests? Ideally without needing more school, but especially not starting back from square one with another bachelor's.

\-Will the acrylic disc and stainless steel pot that I chose be able to withstand the forces present within a vacuum at desired pressure at this size?

\-What is the formula to calculate such a force? (On the acrylic specifically, if that's possible. Unless it would be the same force applied on everything because it's in a ""closed"" system.)

\-Will drilling two \~1/4"" holes into the acrylic weaken it considerably? To the point that, if it would work without the holes, it would not work with them.
