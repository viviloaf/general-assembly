0,Should I leave this job?,1510794119,"I graduated from a good Biomedical Engineering school in my country with a 3.9 GPA about 2 years ago. Since my internship I've worked in the same company until now.

When I joined, the company was in a start-up stage and had started only about a year before I arrived. Throughout this entire time It has never really been easy for us, the company barely breaking even and jumping from investor to investor, trading away equity like crazy. Its still a start-up really

I live in a third world country and the cost of living is a lot lower than in the US, but converting directly as of today I make less than 12k US dollars per year after taxes, which just can't be right.

The work is interesting, but there aren't any experienced guys around to teach us anything and given its perpetual startup status we have a lot of random unrelated stuff to do constantly, which I feel would never really count for anything when viewed by a recruiter or HR guy

Now, I joined the company early, and am I'm right in line to secure an important position within this company. Maybe even lead engineer. The company seems to be about to finally leave the hole these coming months as well, but I feel like we're in this exact same position every three months and nothing changes

Not really sure what to do. I don't have any job alternatives where I live, but I'm in the middle of a master's degree so It would be a waste to leave the country now

I recently took the GRE and scored a 156V/156Q which is subpar compared to my cohort. I retook the GRE and did worse due to the fact I was only able to divert minimal time to it.

2,Work Culture in Engineering?,1510786074,"Hello,

I just got back from a tour around an smallish engineering firm (15 people) and I talked to almost everyone there, it seemed everyone was in cubicles and busy doing their own work. In the common work area, everyone had their headphones on and it felt like a library. No one seemed really happy or enthusiastic about the work that they were doing. I didn't see anyone really working together as were working on CAD models through a server. There wasn't much communication among the employees and the bosses only came around so often to check on how things were going. After going to lunch with a few employees, they seemed very rigid with each other and there wasn't much vibrancy among them.

I am a CHEE student graduating in May. I have two offers that I’m currently considering.

6,"What is this unusual, gattling-cannon like device?",1510780943,"https://imgur.com/a/UoV29

I apologise for the poor quality of the photos, this thing was in a pub and we were about to sit down and eat an ungodly amount of chips. Priorities.

Apparently it was unearthed in a monastery at some point a hundred or so years ago. On the back it appears to have an illustration of the virgin Mary, or similar. On the ""barrel"" end there is what looks for all the world to be a coupling for a pneumatic or fluid line of some kind, but it has a vent hole in the side with no obvious way of closing it, and it doesn't appear to attach to the rest of the mechanism.

On the ""revolver"" end of it is a rotating drum with in the region of 50 thin metal slides. Each slide seems to connect to a brass pin, which extends out the back. The ring that stabilises those brass pins has writing on, in what I assume to be latin (though I didn't inspect it closely), around the circumference. 

The entire ""barrel"" section seems to slide forwards and backwards, and can be pushed by whichever of the slides on the ""revolver"" end is at the top. It doesn't appear to rotate freely as the plate at the top locks up against the slides. The slides also have little protrusions near the rear of the device, which are not all the same length.

I wish I could provide better photos but was in a bit of a rush. I'm mystified, and so were the others I was with. Is it a music box? Some kind of sewing device? A gattling cannon for mice? A device for injecting animals? A spaghetti maker? An air engine of some kind? An alien relic from beyond the moon?

22,"I'm a working ME considering going back to grad school for AeroE but having a dilemma about which ways would be better (online part-time vs full time on-campus, MS vs PhD)?",1510722517,"Hello fellow engineers Redditors,

This is actually my first post here on Reddit. So, I'm having a dilemma about how I want to do my grad school in Aero Engr. Here is my situation:

I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and I've been working for 2 years in Design for Manufacturing at a manufacturing plant. While I work with a pretty good team, the work itself is not super interesting and can be quite aggravating at time, especially when I work more on the quality side vs. spending time solving design manufacturability problems. So I've been thinking about going back to grad school.

I've narrowed down to what I'm interested in studying if I go back. I've been very interested in these 2 fields: aeroelasticity and/or aeroacoustics, since I have always wanted to work with something dealing with aerospace and vibrations/dynamics. Now these 2 fields, I think, sound very specialized and would require a good education and experience package. But my current job really doesn't seem that relevant other than giving me ""real engineering job"" experience. So here is my dilemma:

1) If I continue working where I work and take online MSAE classes part time, does that make me less qualified for some jobs since I won't have a lot of real ""aerospace"" work experience?

2) Or should I go back to school full time and work on relevant researches/interns in order to improve my chance of getting into the fields I wanted? And for those who know anything about these fields, is a MS good enough or do I even need to pursuit a PhD? Or would a PhD be an overkill in terms of qualifications?

3) For people in aerospace engineering industry, what are some potential jobs in your field for these subjects and are some of them in high demand or need a constant supply of engineer?

I know financial hardship would be a real thing if I decide to go back to school full time but I would try to work that out with some kind of assistantship/fellowship.

I really want to hear some opinions and suggestions as well as what people involved with those fields have to say since I've spent sometimes thinking about what I'm really passionate about and I think I've figured it out.

P/S: I'm currently living in Central Alabama, so if anybody have any school recommendation or even potential employers and jobs in the South area, please let me know too. Thanks a lot!

I constantly hear that there are lots of engineering opportunities, but just not in locations where people want to work.

Some background: I’m a MechE, however I went to grad school for CFD and heat transfer (just got my masters). I did an internship and worked with a few ChemEs there (the department never hires on interns, and so I did not get an offer) – learnt about reactors a bit, and process control. The more I read about ChemE, the more I feel I would enjoy it (and do well). I basically like anything to do with numerical modelling, code/model development, and programming/controls.

32,Advice or resources about hollow core augers,1510696683,"I kept the title vague because there is a lot about hollow core augers that I need to learn. Let me start my explaining the application: 

The auger has a cross section that looks like a rectangle with rounded corners. This case hardened spring steel wire is then formed into the shape of an auger. No post forming hardening process. 

It is connected to a shaft of a motor and is then rotated to pull grain through a tube, horizontally. 

I understand their are forces acting upon the auger in relation to the viscosity of the grain (some grain has more sticky oil/fat content), the pitch and thus the angle of the wire in relation to its movement through the grain (shorter pitch makes the wire more perpendicular to the grain increasing the force against the wire),and the frictional forces of the auger rotating against the tube surface. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm ultimately trying to determine what torque will cause the auger to fail. more resistance in the tube causes higher load on the motor and increases the torque exerted on it. What features of the auger allow it to withstand higher torque before it reaches its yield point and permanent deformation (twisting) and or breakage occurs. This is a problem I'm facing and so far it appears an auger with higher carbon content in the steel and a shorter pitch length has better longevity in this application.

I'm still in the middle of my undergraduate studies in EE but am much more interested in software development over all the physics/math/hardware concepts in EE.

44,How to ? Inverted pendulum implementation in Labview from simulation results,1510679082,"Hi guys, 
I am currently working on a rotary inverted pendulum project. My first objective is to keep the pendulum rod in the upright position, then control the disc base in position. 

I modeled the system using energy method, got the EDOs and used Matlab to work with the Laplace Transformed. Then I realised it might be easier to work in state-space variables and use a **Type 1 servo system full-state feedback when the plant has no integrator** to design a controller, with a disc position input. Using the ackermann method, I found my gains feedback matrix K. My simulink diagram works well and I can control the angle of the pendulum, angular velocity, position of disc, speed of disc. The entering value entering state-space bloc represents motor torque.

Now I want to implement that control to Labview for the real thing. My question is, for the state-space part of the diagram, since all my states are measurable (angle, positon, velocity...), all I really need to do in Labview is measure these states, mutliply each state by corresponding feedback gains k1,k2... from K matrix , and substract it to the entering motor torque ?

Thanks for your advice. here is a picture of the full state-feedback control diagram if needed.

48,Is there an international standard for designing highway safety?,1510672794,"I'm comparing my experience with the German Autobahn and the US Interstate. In Germany, it appears that the Autobahn is designed with additional safety features. For example, you hardly see any junctions with opposing traffic merging with each other, and when it happens, there is some distance to allow the cars to slowly merge to the opposite lane. Also, most Autobahn exits are always on the right side. 
In Florida, I've observed many instances where I question the design goals of the road. For example, the I-275 North and I-4 East junction has traffic coming from the right trying to go left to I-275; the distance between the on-ramp and the actual junction is almost non-existent. Once you get on the on-ramp, you are pretty much on the junction, and thus only have a short distance to merge from right to left. Try that at rush hour traffic. Also, I-4 East has multiple exits - you can exit right or you can exit left. Similar situation where you have traffic from I-275 South coming from the right and trying to merge left to exit. Fortunately, the distance is much more, so you have a bit of time to slowly merge to the left exit rather than pushing your way through the line of cars.

57,I am worried I won't be a good engineer when I finish school. Can anyone share similar experiences?,1510641584,"Hey r/askengineers I was wondering, did any of you ever felt similar about engineering before you finished school? I am wrapping up my first semester of my 3rd year of a BSME while working a 30 hour/week internship at a local aerospace company and, although I know that a lot more learning comes once you enter the workforce, I still fear that I lack the skills and intelligence to be a good engineer. I do well in school (3.4 GPA) and I like to think of myself as a hard worker but I definitely have my weaknesses.

My internship is what makes me question my abilities. As an intern, I am being put to use working on a lot of different tasks. I am the only intern at my company (small company) and find myself being thrown into the fire quite often. On any given day I will be completing part and assembly models and drawings in solidworks, writing up different kinds of quality, testing, PMA and CMM reports, completing travelers tracking part purchase orders, working with the production crew in pushing parts out, researching suppliers for different types of coatings/anodizings/passivations, and compelting part inspections, and many other tasks.

I understand as an intern I will be pushing a lot of paperwork, but a lot of the tasks I'm given are things that they (obviously) don't teach us in school. I do my best to absorb the information, but I had no training period and was thrown into everything on day one and expected to learn the system quickly. Although I work hard, do my best to think ahead and work efficiently, I have found myself making minor errors and I feel as though I am under performing and often feel as though my bosses expect better. Often times, I make mistakes purely out of the fact that I have never completed a task similar to what they're asking of me before. (For example, making minor mistakes in a PMA document although I've never written a PMA document before and was never trained how on how to write one.) I feel as though my bosses give me an incredible amount of responsibility and although I am very fortunate to have the opportunity, I feel as though my work is depended on too much by the company for the little real engineering experience that I have. I continue to work hard and try not to let my mistakes discourage me, but sometimes it's difficult when I feel as if my bosses wish they hired someone else because I can't perfect some of their tasks on the first try.

Had anyone felt this way about their internship experience before they finished school? If so, how can I overcome it and now allow it to discourage me? Any words would be greatly appreciated here. Thanks!

Edit: I want to stress that my experience isn't being exaggerated. I am often depended on to complete these tasks entirely on my own and to perfection. I have been yelled at by my bosses for not getting things right on the first try or taking too long to compete a task. I often am given little amounts of information and expected to figure out the rest on my own. I try to figure things out on my own, but sometimes it causes me to take longer to complete a task and my bosses get annoyed. On the contrary, if I were to ask questions to try and speed the process up, my boss would be mad that I didn't try to solve the problem on my own (understandably so). I feel like I can't win here and I am growing discouraged that I am not fit to be a good engineer.

60,Working engineer considering Grad School in Aeroelasticity or Aeroacoustics,1510634931,"Hello fellow engineers Redditors,

This is actually my first post here on Reddit. I've read a lot of threads on Reddit about various things and figure it's time for me to ask for some opinions too.

So, I'm having a dilemma about what I want to do for my graduate engineer education. So here is some background about me:

I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and I've worked at a tire plant for 2 years doing Product Design Validation. While I work with a pretty good team, the work itself is not super interesting and can be quite aggravating at time, especially when I get into administrative stuffs rather than spending time solving design manufacturability problems. So I've been thinking about picking up grad school again.

I've narrowed down to what I'm interested in studying if I go back. I've been very interested in these fields: **aeroelasticity** and/or **aeroacoustics**, since I have always wanted to work with something dealing with aerospace and vibrations/dynamics. Now these 2 fields, I think, sound very specialized and would require a good education and experience package. But my current job really doesn't seem that relevant other than giving me ""real engineering job"" experience. So here is my dilemma:

If I continue working where I work and take online MS classes related to those fields, does that seem like a waste of my time? Or should I need to go back to school full time and work on a relevant research/intern in order to improve my chance of getting into the fields I wanted? And for those who know anything about those fields, is a MS good enough or do I even need to pursuit a PhD (or is a PhD an overkill?)?

I know financial hardship would be a real thing given that I also own a house but I would try to work that out. I just want to get a clear picture of where I should take my career to next. I really don't want to wait for much longer since the idea of grad school would fade away if I wait more.

I really want to hear some opinions and suggestions as well as what people involved with those fields have to say since I've spent sometimes thinking about what I'm really passionate about and I think I've figured it out.

     2. What type of motor would be the most adapted for my system ? I'm currently looking at stepper motors, either with a small torque but with a reducer to compensate or only with high torque. These motors seem quite well fitted for my case but DC motors could also be good as there are only 4 positions.

TL:DR
What would be the best electric motor/motor-reducer to rotate by 90° in 0.6s a ~9kg~ system with a moment of inertia of 0.345kg*m² ?

However, I've heard others counter by saying that a M.S. in chemical engineering with a B.S. in chemistry doesn't make one a good candidate for most engineering jobs because one technically would not be a ""real"" engineer. Is this a common sentiment in the field? The other option, of course, is going back to undergrad. This doesn't seem like an ideal scenario given my background, but if it would be the most advantageous for getting a job, then I suppose I wouldn't have a choice.

Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you. ",AskEngineers,chemguythrowaway,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7cnc79/chem_bs_considering_going_back_to_school_for/
72,Structural Eng help needed. Calculating the load rating when shortening a beam.,1510582171,"I have a 20 ft alumimum I-beam above a hoist that came with a 1000 lb load rating when it was purchased.

77,"Have a few job offers, struggling to pick one",1510549335,"I am fortunate (and good) enough to have landed 4 different job offers at my dream company. They are all fairly different and this will be my first job (I'm a Mech Eng) off school so I am not 100% sure what my personal preferences are in terms of lifestyle (commute, hours, benefits, etc) other than I want to work on cool stuff and make as much money as possible.
My options are:

1. Design engineer: I get to work with an awesome team that I already know (internship) and an awesome manager. The work is a bit mundane, and there do not appear to be a lot of growth opportunities (small team) but I enjoyed it while I was an intern. The people on the team are great and there is technical stuff to be learnt.

2. Technical project manager: I get to report directly to the department's director and manage future projects (""secret stuff""). I do not know the details of the work, nor the people involved (I only know my manager from the interview, he is super experienced, pHd and +10 years in the industry). I assume this job pays more than the 1st as I will be around more high profile people (?).

3. New projects engineer: I get to do grunt work, from CAD to turning bolts (hands-on), working on designing and assembling prototypes. It is also a small team, but the team has a lot of visibility from upper management. Also, this job is in LA which sounds sick. I do not know any of the persons on the team, but the manager is pretty young so he must be pretty good to be on that position. 

4. New technologies team: I get to investigate, prototype, and propose new technologies and processes to be used on our products. Lots of meeting with costumers and brainstorming concepts. It's a superstar team (but I do not know them personally), but their role within the company is not really clear to me. This job would allow me to be in touch and work together with the team from job #1, which I am pretty close with.

These are in a Fortune 500 company in the Bay Area. All the jobs are superb, but as you may be able to tell, I am struggling to prioritize: friendships (I know some of the teams), career prospects (growth), money (I want to pay for my grad), and lifestyle (one of the jobs is in LA which I may like better than the BayA).

I am using the Canadian standards, and it seems to be a little bit less complete than for AASHTO's ( we dont have the ""optimization"" tool).

Bring in the well pump...we are blessed with an amazing well with unlimited drinking water, and have a big water tank we like to keep full at the top of the property.

13,Rate and Stabilize Modes in flightcontrollers only for pilot choice or also beneficial for other reasons?,1510427231,"I am an RC plane pilot and have flown quads both in rate mode and stabilize mode. In such vehicles, there are two modes 'rate' and 'stabilize' which determine how the PID calculations will be done and which data to use for them. There are 2 'loops', one (the inner) using gyro angular rates, the other (outer loop) using absolute angles from the IMU unit. The pilot can choose whether to only use the inner loop for more aggressive maneuvers or use the stabilization mode, where the vehicle will calm down when the sticks are centered. In rate mode, the gyro data is used together with the desired angular rate from the pilot to move the quad at a set angular rate, and the outer PID loop is unused. In stabilize mode, both loops are active, incorporating not just the gyro rates but also the calculated absolute orientation in quaternions or yaw/pitch/roll.

While writing my own flight controller, I achieved an acceptable result just using the absolute orientation for P and I and the gyro rates for D. It behaves like in stabilize mode and obviously cannot do rate mode.

Question: does rate mode and stabilize mode exist only so that the pilot can switch, or is there a benefit of having both loops?

Also, should I enable PID parameter tuning for the inner, outer, or both loops? I would think both, but the flight controllers I have used have only one set of coefficients to tune.

14,Flow conditioner design for DIY air flow meter,1510426135,"Hi!
I'm currently designing a home furnace for forging purposes and I found it would be interesting to get an approximate reading of my air supply. I'm thinking about a pitot tube that I would insert somewhere between the blower and the furnace. I could calibrate my measurement by blowing into a known volume plastic bag, for instance.

The only thing I remember about flow measurements is that I should get a straight run 15-30 diameters before the flow meter to ensure good readings. I also know that I could get a flow straightener in the form of smallish tubes packed together. Now here are my questions:

* How important would be the error if I didn't use either a straight run or a flow straightener?
* What would be the absolute minimum requirement for a flow straightener? (geometry, length...)

I'm really not looking for an accurate measurement, just an estimate (accuracy to 15-25% would be fine), so axial length and simplicity will be my priorities. Any help will be much appreciated!",AskEngineers,Drepanon,/r/AskEngineers/comments/7ca6eh/flow_conditioner_design_for_diy_air_flow_meter/
15,"What is the actual physical meaning of ""Isentropic Efficiency?""",1510418039,"Just to elaborate the source of my curiosity, I recently found a few case studies where Isentropic Efficiency was considered an important performance indicator for industrial gas compressors.

Lets go by a similar example of a process fluid being pressurized through a compressor. Please correct me if i'm wrong but if I wanted to know the total useful energy added to the fluid, I would simply compute the enthalpy increase of the fluid during the compression process.

Now I've seen the definition of isentropic efficiency to be the ratio of isentropic enthalpy increase to the actual enthalpy increase. This is where I get confused. Since the actual enthalpy increase is always higher, shouldn't it translate to more energy being added to the fluid and hence more effective output from our process? Or is this ""extra"" energy somehow unusable? 

Also, is isentropic efficiency a measure of the deviation of our system from an ideal reversible adiabatic process? Or does it offer more information?

I think I finally have a clearer understanding - that the flux density (B) is a medium's response to an excitation by a magnetic field of intensity (H).

If that's correct, then the field intensity (H) would appear to be the more general and universal descriptor, as it describes the field strength without any dependencies on the medium.

So if that's the case, then why are magnetic field strengths typically referred to in units of flux density (B, i.e. Teslas) - for example with MRI machines, earth's magnetic field, etc...?  Doing it that way, they have to make an assumption that the medium is air.  However, characterizing the field strength in terms of intensity (H) would be free of the need to make that assumption.

Is there an aspect to this that I'm still missing?

[Datasheet](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/302/UDA1361TS-1127970.pdf)

I'm concerning myself with pins:

1. - Left channel input
2. - $V_{ref}$, which on [page 8](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/302/UDA1361TS-1127970.pdf#page=8&amp;zoom=220,40,418) claims to sit nominally at half the supply voltage. I assume this pin is broken out simply to slap some filtering on it, but may have to be used in some way for the biasing scheme, externally?
3. - Right channel input
4. - $V_{RN}$, Negative reference voltage
5. - $V_{RP}$, Positive reference voltage

Essentially, **I was wondering whether I have to do anything to bias the inputs to this chip to around half the supply voltage**, where the left/right stereo channels connect on pins 1 and 3. The [example circuit provided on page 12](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/302/UDA1361TS-1127970.pdf#page=12&amp;zoom=90,-267,621) seems to imply that biasing is not necessary... AC coupling capacitors C11 and C12 remove any DC offset that may be present at both inputs. But if nothing is done internally in the chip, at the inputs, then the audio signal would seem to swing below ground. Obviously, that would not be a good thing...

Pins 4 and 5 are the reference voltages, and [the example circuit on page 12](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/302/UDA1361TS-1127970.pdf#page=12&amp;zoom=90,-267,621) shows that they range from GND to $V\_{DDA}$, aka the top rail. I could perhaps understand if these were connected to dual rails, you could tolerate $V_{in Left, in Right}$ swinging below ground... But they just have it setup for single rail.

Question 2:  While I'm at it, what exactly is the purpose of the 1nF capacitors to ground on the input pins 1 and 3 in [the example circuit](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/302/UDA1361TS-1127970.pdf#page=12&amp;zoom=90,-267,621)?

I preferred to lead by example. It's not that I didn't express my opinions either though - I suggest better ways of doing stuff and passively get on people's asses if they're not doing their job. I'm really not sure what it is, it's not that I don't want responsibility, because I'll often lead group projects for class. 

A lot of this has continued in college. I don't have any leadership positions, and frankly, I don't really want them. But companies love seeing those on resumes for some reason. Why does everyone need to be a leader though? Leaders don't necessarily know what they're doing any more than subordinates. I would think that it's better to be a good listener and follow directions, especially at the beginning of your career.

All I can find are charts for steel.  I need to make sure that an instrument will fit through an NPT coupling that I want to use as a standoff from a water line.  The only dimension charts I can find are for steel, and in steel I have plenty of clearance (0.0875 probe through a 1.049"" ID pipe, where OD is 1.315 and both walls are .133 ea). Needs to be Sch 40 so I can thread it.  

I asked someone to provide a 1"" NPT M to 1"" NPT F coupling with an ID consistent with Sch 40 in C-276 (This is generally a totally useless part, I know,  but I need an inch or so of standoff and this gets me there.  I am being punished enough by having to pay through the nose to get someone to machine the part, take it easy on me here...)  Anyhow, the ID shown in their  drawing is &lt;0.820.  It is a 3000# coupling, so thats probably the reason for the dimension change, but I think I am going to have to have them drill it out to at least 0.900.  The rest of the skid is done in Sch 10 and Sch 40, and this line in particular is sch 40, I just want to make sure I am not cutting the wall thickness too thin by asking them to bore out the ID to 0.900.  OD of the 3000# coupling is still 1.315, consistent with a Sch 40 OD.

61,Advice on Job Offers at Auto OEMs,1510257093,"Hi all, I am graduating with a BS-Electrical Engineering this semester and I have a couple of offers for full time now. I am having a really hard time deciding which one is better, and if anyone has any advice for me in this I'd greatly appreciate it.

&amp;nbsp;

The first offer is at company A in a position in their autonomous vehicle (AV) group. This is great because it allows me to further develop my software skills (it is mainly a software position with some extra hardware and testing going on), work on this in-demand and upcoming technology, as well as travel as they are giving me the option of spending some time in their facility in Europe which is something I really wanted to do. The team is more fast paced due to the level of technology we are working with compared to the slow pace that auto companies usually  work at. I've met with some people on the team and they are nice and friendly, seems like it would be a good environment. The downside to this offer is that company A is a good company but not the best auto company by any means, benefits are not as good as other companies, and company A is known to have a stressful environment and bad processes. 

My other offer is in a company B rotational program. You rotate through different groups, then you are placed in a group according to your preferences and the openings at the time. company B is a great company and I've heard nothing but positive things about the culture there and how they take care of their employees. The rotational program will allow me to see lots of different areas, network a lot and pick what I like the most (I'm not exactly sure what I want to work in right now). company B also has a lot of young people coming in (good for me to have young coworkers to interact with) and is making the company a lot more attractive towards millennials. They also have a lot of groups and programs for the employees on center. The downside is I may not end up getting the exact position I want, and if I figure it out right away I'm still stuck doing rotations for 2 years. Benefits are great and during this process I have already seen how much effort the company puts into their employee satisfaction. At this point I think I would like to get into AV and will likely do a rotation in that group at company B but there is no telling whether I can get into it for sure after the rotations. I really like the tech industry and I'm not sure if I want to stay in auto or move back to the tech industry after a couple of years so I'm also afraid of getting stuck in the auto industry. AV helps alleviate that because it's sort of a combination of them both. 

&amp;nbsp;

Other info: salary is the same, company B benefits&gt;company A benefits, same commute time from my home. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Is a rotational program worth it to help me advance my different skills rather than jumping straight in and focusing on 1-2 skills for the next 2 years? Would it be better to join this in-demand team in AV now and get the travel experience as well? I'm really torn...

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** Company A autonomous vehicle entry level or company B rotational program? Help

63,Non-mechanical Engineer trying to solve work problem - looking for input.,1510253258,"Hello, ive got a problem im trying to solve and it involves trying to rotate a diaphragm pump that is mounted on a rotating platform. I estimate the pump and platform together weigh about 50-80 lbs. 

The way it works is when the operators have to fill up our system they connect to the pump when it is in the normal position with the pump sitting in the normal position. When they need to clean or cip the pump they have to rotate the platform 180 deg and it is inverted and they lock it down with a locking pin on a lanyard.

The reason i was assigned this was someone got their hands into a pinch point and really messed up their hand. My idea is to attach a shaft and make part of the shaft the pivot point and use a 9"" 1/2""-3/4"" shaft and have that stick out to the operator side and put a key and key-way into it to attach to the pump platform and the other end of the shaft bored out with a key-way and key to a 14"" diameter handwheel which would keep both hands out of the process.

After going back there and moving the pump by hand i found that the pivot point is about 2"" to high with the majority of the weight at the bottom as when you get to say the 90 deg point it gets hard to spin the station and im thinking that the 14"" hand wheel i wont have enough torque or Rim pull force to easily do it by hand. I am not a mechanical engineer so if there are some more experienced people out there that could lead me in the right direction.

One of the other thoughts i had was to put some type of ratcheting reducer that with a crank or ratchet type system the operator could take a crank or socket and ratchet type wrench and just turn it until it is in the 180 deg inverted position. 

Im uploading some solid works images i copied and some actual pics to give everyone a idea what im looking at. also another thought was to drill the the 2"" rectangular hollow bracket or frame and raise the COG to the correct center so it spins easier. Please if anyone is bored could you take a look and tell me if im being a idiot. LOL

66,How To Minimize Lengths Of Tubing Needed For Many Cut Parts?,1510249806,"I frequently order material for structures that contain many different lengths on the same tubing.

Easy example: I need a 2 5' lengths, 3 6' lengths, a 1' length and a 10' length. I only need to buy 2 20' sticks and cut them 5 5 10 and 6 6 6 1, with 1' waste.

Just read a wiki article about HVDC(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_DC_Intertie). It reads""One advantage of direct current over AC is that DC current penetrates the entire conductor as opposed to AC current which only penetrates to the so-called skin depth""



Is that true? Skin effect only works in high frequency situations?

I was curious if air pressure and fans works pretty much exactly like water, if the setup was a 12"" square hose pouring water instead of a fan, wouldn't the flow rate aka movement of water mass (GPM) be the exact same with the hole OR without it, because the only difference is pressure?

97,"Questions on (un)bending steel, and on transferring shapes onto curved surfaces",1510158603,"Hi guys, I've got a couple of questions that have arisen as part of a project to build a smoker. 

The first is on unbending steel. I have got hold of a piece of 1/4"" steel plate from the scrap yard. It's four feet by two, and has a slight bow in the middle, about 1"". I'd like to try and straighten it out a bit before I cut and weld it. The plan is to shim it with some wooden blocks, and drive a car on top. Is there some sort of guide as to how high I should make the shims to get it roughly flat. Intuition says about 2"", but I wondered if there's some sort of rule of thumb as to how much it flexes back.

The second issue is how to transfer a line onto a curved surface to cut a hole for the chimney. The cook chamber is made from two 100lb propane tanks. I've cut sections down the long axis, and welded them together into a sort of 'twin hull' design. The chimney is nominally triangular in section, and needs to be attached at the end, where the cut-down domes meet. I would like to be able to map the chimney section onto these intersecting hemispheres, but can't think of a neat way of doing it. 

Any help would be much appreciated. I can figure both out by trial and error, but am always interested to learn new theory and techniques. Thanks very much.

6,What are possible roadblocks and considerations for developing 3d printed structures.,1510122223,"Hey all,

I've been going over plans for a robotic gantry with a concrete extruder and I was interested in what you guys think would be some unknown hoops to get through if one wanted to start 3d printing concrete houses for rental properties or to live in. The method would be more than likely extruding layers of a grout or mortar and building up the sides exterior/ interior walls of the structure in this way. Then installing vertical and horizontal rebar in the middle and finally finishing the walls by pouring regular concrete into the middle. So for example if my wall was to be 8 inches thick, I'd print 2 inch layers of a cement/sand mixture to make the shell, then lay in the rebar in the 4 inch gap in the middle and finally fill in the gap with concrete. 
As long as everything met building code, there would be a solid reinforced middle to the walls so I imagine that would limit the concerns with layered walls and new construction techniques.

25,Hey AskEngineers: I've made a new excel tool for structural engineers and was hoping to get some feedback.,1510076137,"Hey guys,

I've posted here before, and have gotten pretty good feedback in the past, and was hoping you guys could take another look at an updated tool that we recently released. 

**A Little Background**

We've been working on some excel tools with the primary goal of extending excel's functionality to accomodate some of the more complex structural analysis methods. 

We just released a new beta tool for developing beam cross sectional properties, and are excited to get it out into the wild for further evaluation. We'd love it if you guys took a look and let us know your thoughts. 

**Tool Overview**

The tool download and a more thorough write up can be found here: [Beta Release](https://www.excelexpress.org/section-analysis-plugin-version-2-0-beta-release/)

And here's a link to a tool introduction tutorial: [Building your first shape](https://www.excelexpress.org/section-analysis-plug-in-version-2-0-building-your-first-section/)

But basically, at it's core, it's an add-in that lets you create built up beam cross sections from a predefined set of shapes. In addition, each shape can be assigned a unique material. The addin outputs a visual plot of the section as well as beam section properties.

We think that bringing this type of functionality to excel can help speed up the analysis process, especially in scenarios where iteration or optimization of structure is required. 

**Open Source**

We'll be making the source code for our solving engines public. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/excelexpress/SectionProperties). It's published under the MIT License, so you're more than welcome to use it. 

**What We'd Like From You**

We were hoping to get some feedback on feature improvements that you'd like to see, any bugs that you come across while playing around with it, or any other general thoughts on the tool.

It is basically a way to produce a single continuous and stable tone from a string with one foot by standing and playing another instrument with both hands.

So either I am looking for a different solution altogether or a way to somehow equalise the rotational speed. In my imagination it would be done by limiting the top speed somehow, so even if you crank faster. or push the pedal faster or harder that gets converted into rotation, like a spinning wheel.

As you arrive at BM you're handed a half-heart on a lanyard.  As the two matching halves are brought together, they blink faster.  A connector on the side will let two hearts be touched together.  While the correct two touch, the blink becomes a new pattern - a normal heartbeat, probably.

The battery life is very important, but it is understood that it might not last the week.  I am hoping the devices can later be reused for ""find-my-parent"" style locators at festivals (way cheaper than carrying around a cell phone).

Ideally they would piggy back of the existing cell network somehow.  Distant halves would only ping the network infrequently, whereas close items would update more frequently (on the assumption people are trying to find each other).

It's basically two stamped metal sheets with a rubber extrusion in-between. The metal is arched, and it basically acts as a spring.

I am trying to figure out how the forces of the arch spring, and the force exerted by the spring on the wiper arm, workout to produce an even force distribution on the windshield glass. 
I imagine that at first, the force from the arm creates a reaction force on the first two points to contact the windshield, as seen on the left side of my [drawing](https://i.imgur.com/fTcyr3O.png). And then the force of the arm compresses the arch spring until the whole blade is in contact with the windshield. From there on, I am not sure how explain the even force distribution, in my mind there would only be 3 pressure points (two extremes, and the centre). Anyone knows how this works? 

Also, the spring force of the arch is probably related to geometry (curvature and thickness of metal), and material (elasticity). How would changing these parameters affect the force distribution? What if the wiper arm puts more force on the wiper blade?

Thanks in advance.

I'm contemplating building a motorized crane for my kids (ok, building it is for me; playing with it will be for the kids).

What I am trying to figure out is how to keep the payload stationary. Basically I assume while I'm energizing the motor up it will obviously lift. But once I stop lifting and want the load to remain where it is, I assume a regular DC hobby motor will just free spin backwards and the load will drop.

Am I right? Will other motor types do better? I've read that servos have a lot of gearbox resistance - so maybe a continuous rotation servo?

I can do all the RPM, gearing, and torque calcs to select a specific motor myself - it's really just the type of motor I'm uncertain about. That said, here is some more info on my project in case it helps:

* I'm thinking it'll be 1m tall, looking for around 5-10sec lift time, 0.5kg payload would be fine.
* I have no preference for motor type: AC, DC, gear motor, stepper, whatever.
* I'd prefer a simple / easy / cheap solution. It doesn't need to be awesome.

6,Is it possible to develop a passion for engineering?,1509839678,"or anyone here that managed to cultivate a passion for it? 

Reason I am asking this, is I am studying engineering, because I found that engineering was one of the sources of increased effieciency in meeting the needs of humanity and thus results in more free time for humanity with increasing automation. I saw this as one of the most useful things I could do, simply put (Ofcourse I know I have to be really competent to be able to contribute to invention/automation, and I also know that I won't be able to do it on my own, I am merely talking about contributing to it and being in the field working on the innovation). 

But I have found that the process of learning how to become an engineer is not something I am drawn to. Whenever I study I am always thinking of other things I like to do. I have found out that it's probably partly due to my enviroment growing up that conditioned me to like certain things. What I have found of many engineers, is that they tended to grow up with the way of thinking that engineering requires and also get inspired by certain things that lead them to engineering and them liking the process of becoming an engineer. 

I have found I don't really have that and that my situation is akin to someone wanting to become a musician purely for the fame, or because they want the ability to play really well, without actually liking the process of learning to play. And that is because my desire to want to become an engineer is mostly from a rational perspective, I see engineering more as an instrument, as opposed to something that I value intrinsically. I have found that this puts me at an disadvantage compared to people that intrinsically love/like engineering, and also makes me wonder wether I should continue and such.

I also envy engineers and people that happen to born with a desire to become an engineer. Because  I seems that engineers get to:

- Make a tangible impact to an industry, if they are persistent and competent enough
- Save time for humans by automating things
- Be able to help humanity do things in a very tangible way
- Earn higher that average amounts of currency.

14,Seeking Opinions On An App To Connect Engineers From Around The World,1509823834,"Dear engineers of reddit,

I'd here to ask for your opinions and encourage your critique on an idea that I've been tossing around in my head. I'll outline the ""problem"" and how the app would address that problem below.

**Problem:** from my limited work experience at a small engineering firm and based on the existence of this sub alone, often times young engineers have questions regarding their work that internal staff at their place of work don't necessarily have answers to. That or they're simply curious about a topic and would like to hear ideas from those more experienced in the field than themselves. This isn't exactly a problem per-se but the sharing of knowledge among engineers is something that I believe should be made more accessible (the amount of engineers that I've spoken to that don't know about reddit is surprising).

**Idea:** a mobile/web app that provides an platform and user-friendly interface for engineers to interact and connect. Something more focused than say reddit and more readily marketable and appealing to older-generation engineers or employers.

What I envision is something tangentially similar to the concept of Uber. Experienced or retired engineers (more geared toward retired engineers) who have a passion for the profession and simply love solving problems or sharing what they know would be able to sign up and proceed through a verification process that prevents fraud activity - maybe through Linkedin. Employers and employees who are looking for answers, or maybe encounter a lack of knowledge in some areas of their work frequently, but not frequently enough to facilitate the staffing of an employee in that field, would have access to the database of engineers, categorised by their areas of expertise. 

The similarity to Uber, and what would set this platform apart from Google or Quora or other existing Q/A platforms, would be the ability for the party who is volunteering their expertise to choose when they appear available for questions at their leisure. Appearing available for questions would allow the answer-seeking party to reach out instantly with a phone call through the app. One party offers their verified and trustworthy services at their leisure (ie. the driver in Uber's business model), another party seeks out these services when necessary for an instant response (ie. the passenger in Uber's business model).

So that's it in a medium sized nutshell. There are a lot more intricacies and applications that I have in mind which I won't post here in the interest of keeping things relatively short.

29,Questions about BLDC motors,1509756387,"I have a few questions about BLDC motors that I can't really get a solid grasp on. For all of these, assume that the motor is an ideal brushless motor or in other words, 100% efficient.

First question: Often times, people will gear down BLDC motors to achieve more torque. This makes sense because if your application requires 1000 RPM and your motor spins at 10,000 RPM, you don't need 9000 RPM of headroom. It just doesn't make sense practically. But then I started thinking about the torque curve and remembered that for an ideal motor, torque drops off linearly as RPM goes up (assuming input power is constant throughout RPM range). So if if they were to use a 10:1 gearbox to get the desired 1000 RPM, the motor would be spinning at 10,000 RPM. If they *don't* use a gearbox, the motor would be a direct drive and thus, spin at 1000 RPM. So yes, the 10:1 increases torque by 10 at the output, but doesn't the torque measured at the motor decrease by 10? Meaning the total gain in torque is nil? If so, what's the point? The only thing I can think of for real world usage is to get the motor to operate in its most efficient RPM. Is that the only reason? Or am I missing something?

Second question: Let's say the brushless motor we are looking at has 9 stator poles, 12 magnet poles, and is an outrunner (aka bell type). Now I understand that one way to get a higher Kv rating (RPM/Volt unloaded) is to increase the number of turns of wire per stator pole. But what would happen if instead, you changed the number of magnet poles? Lets say I changed the number of magnet poles from 12 to 24 and the amount of stator poles stayed at 9. Would that half the Kv? Every time the next phase turns on it attracts the next magnet, and if it has to do that twice as much to complete a revolution, wouldn't that reduce the Kv? Off the top of my head, it doesn't make much sense to rewire with more wire *AND* thinner wire (in order to fit new turns), because the resistance would increase a lot. And that will decrease the input power, unless you increase the voltage... but if you increase the voltage, that increases the speed proportionally and you haven't changed anything. So why don't we use more magnet poles instead of more turns on the stator?

33,"Do we actually know how to make a quantum computer work, or is it all mostly theoretical still?",1509741900,"I'm doing a presentation on quantum computers for a college level course and I need to describe it in deeper detail than it is often presented by the media.  I've read the “dumbed down” description a dozen times.  Quantum bits are stored as a spin states in painstakingly stabilized particles, etc.  I've even read on how the inputs and outputs could be controlled using lasers.  I've heard how complex algorithms could be executed “millions of times faster than with conventional computers”.  But what's never clearly explained is how this would be physically executed.  What is the engineering behind a quantum computer? How would it's logic gates execute problems?

Like... say I have 16 q-bits.  They're grouped into 4 bits of 4.  So 4 numbers that can range from zero to  fifteen.  They're tweaked with a laser to give them 4 values.  Say... 11, 8, 14 and 2.  Or... 1011, 1000,  1110, and 0010.  Now I want to use the super fast quantum nature of the q-bits to rapidly sort them in incremental order.  How is that done?  I mean we can use a laser to read the state of the bits and compare them to one another.  But that's the same as using a standard computer to do a comparative sort of the numbers.

Say we double the number of q-bits and we entangle the bits from one set to the next. Okay, we have two sets of four numbers that are entangled with one another.  The moment we nudge one of the numbers with a laser, it's partner loses the entangled state (it falls into an opposite spin I think, so this would be useful as a set inverter?)

I guess I'm looking for an in-between answer.  Not one that goes into the complex collapsing wave-function mathematics (which I suspect are beyond me).  But one that elaborates more than just “Quantum algorithms will be faster than standard algorithms because... they're quantum!  Entanglement!  Super position states!”

Another way of asking my question is... are quantum computers like nuclear fusion?  A technology that holds tremendous potential, but that we haven't gotten to work yet.

*Can be used to design 3D structures. (Think design of a simple structure like a barn, or a wall with multiple angles)*
*Will allow for input of variables such as material's strength (to account for use of steel reinforced wall, vs. say cardboard), surface friction, Mass (of supported objects)*
*Allows for input of Mods or plugin software that can expand upon its base support*

**Non-critical**

*Ability to calculate Work*
*Ability to calculate Center of Gravity*

If you're interested in just the questions for which I'm looking for answers feel free to skip right to the TL;DR.

So some context: I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering with a focus on materials engineering in Canada one year ago, and have been working in California since. I'd like to advance my career beyond the level that is typically achievable with an undergraduate degree, and end up in an R&amp;D/leadership type role in a position that is tied closely to materials engineering and the study/development of new materials or new applications of existing materials. I plan to return to Canada and pursue a research-based Master's degree in materials engineering, then hopefully return here to California once that is completed.

I've been offered a research position under a professor whose areas of research include smart materials, namely shape memory alloys and piezoelectrics, surface engineering at the nano/micro level for reduced friction and corrosion reduction, and energy harvesting using piezoelectric materials. 

Although I'm very interested in smart materials and materials engineering as a whole, I'm concerned about job opportunities. Personally I've met two people so far who are specialized in these fields and have been out of work for over a year each which is discouraging although I don't think that two people are a good sample size.

This post is already quite long which I apologize for, so:

**TL;DR:** what are your opinions on the materials engineering industry and the worth of obtaining a master's degree in this field? If there are specific areas of materials engineering that are expected to grow in the near future, which do you believe those are? What are your opinions on smart materials and their applications/job prospects for the near future? If there are any California based engineers that can provide input that would be a bonus.

My biggest interests in astronomy are planets and solar system bodies, and exoplanets. I also think these (mainly the former) are important to study, as opposed to some dust around a nearby galaxy.

Anyway, I'm taking a spaceflight mechanics class this semester out of interest in space with regards to practice, not observation. I met with the professor to talk about careers in industry for someone with my background. He recommended a 1-year Masters of Engineering degree.

I could focus on planetary science/exploration, which means half engineering and half grad-level astronomy courses. I'm super interested. I have a good shot at getting in.

59,What are my prospects for the US?,1509660335,"I’m a 25 year old Male from the U.K.  
I’m considering at some point, a move abroad (focusing on the US for this question) for some experience of a different way of life and to see some more of the world. I’d like to know where I should tailor my life towards now. 
For what I lack in qualifications I make up with experience.  In brief;

At 17 I joined an apprenticeship as a Telecommunications Technician, where I learnt a wide range of skills, the apprenticeship took 3 years to complete and included college work, essays, exams and training courses. 

At 21 I finished my apprenticeship early and found a job in a telecoms maintenance and minor works team. Maintaining equipment as well as faulting, rectifying and installing new equipment. 

After 2 years, At 23 I was promoted to a assistant Telecoms Project Engineer for enhancements and  construction projects. 
To review new designs to ensure they comply to company, and industry standards and engaging with key stake holders and management of system requirements etc

After 10 months I was promoted to Project Engineer (a promotion that also includes a new role of Chief Engineer for a single project) which is more of an ‘all things engineering -project management ‘ role. The number of projects in total I now manage was halved when Compared to my previous role, however I am not much more seriously involved with these projects and provide much more dedicated time and engineering expertise/consultation. 

As well as a wealth of experience and courses, I have several ‘smaller’ qualifications from my own company courses, to other private companies and several well known larger ones. 
I’m considering applying for the company funded University level foundation degree programme (2 years) combined with which I may be able to graduate with previous certificates. 

My question stands. If I’m looking to work abroad, (focused on the US at present) how does my current situation stand? Do I require more qualifications or experience?

I’ve been home for several months now, applied for hundreds of jobs, and have had only two phone conversations with HR people. Heard back from neither.

To get to the point, I’m not sure grad school is a good idea right now. I’d be going for a masters in mechanical or aerospace and those programs are expensive. If I do get financial aid (by being a T.A.) there’s living costs to think about. Without a full time job I can’t afford it, unless I were to take out a loan of some kind.

63,What's the deal with Tunnel Boring Machines?,1509652930,"I was reading Elon Musk's pitch for the Boring Company, particularly how he plans to improve on tunnel boring technology. They have some interesting points:

&gt;
* First, reduce the tunnel diameter. To build a one-lane tunnel, the tunnel diameter must be approximately 28 feet. By placing vehicles on a stabilized electric skate, the diameter can be reduced to less than 14 feet. Reducing the diameter in half reduces tunneling costs by 3-4 times. Secondly, increase the speed of the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). TBMs are super slow. A snail is effectively 14 times faster than a soft-soil TBM.  Our goal is to defeat the snail in a race. Ways to increase TBM speed:
* Increase TBM power. The machine’s power output can be tripled (while coupled with the appropriate upgrades in cooling systems).
* Continuously tunnel. When building a tunnel, current soft-soil machines tunnel for 50% of the time and erect tunnel support structures the other 50%. This is not efficient. Existing technology can be modified to support continuous tunneling activity.  
* Automate the TBM. While smaller diameter tunneling machines are automated, larger ones currently require multiple human operators. By automating the larger TBMs, both safety and efficiency are increased.  
* Go electric. Current tunnel operations often include diesel locomotives. These can be replaced by electric vehicles.  
* Tunneling R&amp;amp;D. In the United States, there is virtually no investment in tunneling Research and Development (and in many other forms of construction).  Thus, the construction industry is one of the only sectors in our economy that has not improved its productivity in the last 50 years. 

A lot of these seem like pretty obvious things to do. Could tunneling really be improved this way? In particular is his last point, that there is very little R&amp;amp;D on boring machines, correct?

Basicly im down 1500$ so far and probleme still persist, just about to throw the tub in the garbage.

Here what have been done
- Replaced sensor
- Replaced heater (breaker was triping off instantly before that)
- Replaced motherboard (this included a new heater new sensor and new fuses)
- checked heater pump seems all clean and flow seems good to me.
- filter and water tube been looked nothing seems to be blocking anything (they are white/transparent ish)

Tech support are 100% sure it is a flow probleme but the thing is sometime the temp is only 75F and the spa code OHH even tho it just started 10 sec ago. According to the user guide of the spa it take about 30sec after a startup to start heating. So a bit confuse how it can be a flow problem if the spa hasnt heated anything (yet)

If it reach set temp the heater and pump stop normaly by itself.

What hasnt been checked or replaced
-Control panel
-Wiring
-other component such as the pump 2 and 3, ozone, anti-uv light, sequencer (i highly doupt these would code that since the spa can run without them being plug and still code OHH from time to time)

Also been told that control panel can not cause such error (being a bit doubtful here tho)

76,EE Looking for new career path ..,1509624854,"Currently 30 years old with ~8 years work experience. I just took my PE last Friday and am waiting for results. 

I graduated with my EE degree (with focus in power) in 2010. Interned at a firm for 2 summers and they ended up hiring me full time when I graduated. They placed me in their substation design department as an engineer. We worked with many different utilities both near and far. I was stuck in the office starring at drawings with the typical, (in my opinion) terrible office life. Same commute, same people, same grind every single day. It sucked. I lasted just over 3 years and left. 

My second (and current) job is working for the utility. In my case, I’m in power generation (we generate in one area and have T&amp;D in other areas). Our steam plants are 50+ years old. Literally. We have a bunch of “newer” gas turbine/peaking sites that are from the 70’s. I’m in the power engineering group, which is centrally located in an office. Our job is to support all the sites when shit hits the fan or when they want to buy new equipment. Basically I’ll be called if something blows up, a motor fails, something trips, we’re buying a new transformer/motor/breakers, a spec for material or work needs to be written, etc. This gets me out of the office quite frequently – which I enjoy. I’ve been here just over 3 years now, and it’s starting to get boring. Due to the fact that these plants are so old and I’m involved with just “patching” the issue, it’s getting old fast. The same sites, the same people. No new technology, all ancient shit. The repetitiveness over the years is what’s getting me I think. I’m a people person, no question. I like new things. I like change. I can’t seem to fathom accepting this process for the next 30 years of my life. Something has to change.

Assuming that I passed my PE, I’m going to be looking for a new gig pretty much immediately. This is where the problem occurs. I don’t exactly know what I want. Everyone who knows me says I would do amazing in sales. Not afraid to talk to anyone, outgoing, good people skills, etc. These are definitely not traits of your ‘typical’ engineer. This is all good and dandy, except for the fact that I have literally zero sales experience. I don’t know what a good sales gig is vs a terrible one. I wouldn’t know if the offer is gold or garbage. I work with many different vendors and reps from many different companies In my current position. I thought about reaching out to the ones that I’m closer with to see what they have to say about it. Aside from sales, I also thought about a field/apps engineer. That would put me on different projects in different locations pretty frequently. With my experience, this would probably be the “easier” option for me to land. Does anyone have experience in one, if not both of these roles? Which did you enjoy more? 

With all this being said, what else is out there for someone like me? I know there has to be opportunities that fit me that I haven’t thought about yet. I’d love to hear any and all your thoughts. Much appreciated!

* I'm really good at Excel and I love using it to solve problems (using the different formulas, learning new ones, using the solver function and setting up optimization problems that way, I have basic handle on writing and employing macros using VBA to make tasks faster/ make ""excel calculators"" for repetitive tasks)

1,Field Service Engineer Advice,1509552382,"I recently graduated with a degree in electrical engineering and got a job as a field service engineer. At first the job seemed amazing, especially the travel perks, which is what drew me in. However, now I'm starting to regret my decision.


I hardly feel like an engineer and more like a technician. All I do are repairs and support out in the field. If I follow the given procedures I can complete the task without much thought. What use is my degree when someone is spoon-feeding me the solutions? I want to create designs that solve complex problems. I don't want to turn a wrench and follow premade steps. I'd rather be in the office coming up with designs and running simulations and not on my stomach trying to shove my hand into awkward positions.


What scares me the most is that I'm afraid I'm going to forget what I learned in school. I didn't spend 4 years of intense studying just to never use anything I learned again. Plus, I loved what I learned. Every bit of it was fascinating. But now, I haven't looked at a single circuit, run any spice simulations, or even thought about E&amp;M. I'm afraid of losing it all. I'm afraid of growing complacent and slowly declining. I make an effort at work to understand why I follow the procedures and dig deeper at a lower level. But it's hard to find the right people who can verify my understanding. I'm doing my best to feel like an engineer but at the end of the day I feel like a technician. It's making me very depressed.


Can anyone lend me a new perspective? I want to like my job. I want to see why it's engineering, but each time I work in the field it becomes harder. I want to change my mind and not see myself as a technician. I'm willing to listen to any advice.

The company she works for now is a major international company with a few plants in the US (just not where we want to live) and many more overseas.  She has coworkers in the US who would gladly be a reference for her.  I am sure we will need to use a service like WES that can transfer over her degree to the US, do you know of one that is preferred by most companies for Engineers?

Currentl I'm a network Admin and I have been in the Computer/IT world professionally for about 4 years now. Immediately out of high school I found a full time job and started working right away. I knew that in the Computer world experience and certifications can sometimes speak louder than a degree. After working with computers and networking I've come to realize that this isn't what I want to do. As I'm sure many people have done in their lifetime. 

I've always said that if I go back to school it would be for Engineering. That is the only other thing that has interested me and after working with a couple of Electrical Engineers I know that I would like to get my electrical engineering degree. 

Unfortunately my current role requires me to travel very frequently (at least 2-3 times a month) and getting into school is going to be problematic with this role. 

At the moment I live with my Fiance in an Apartment and out rent alone is a fair amount. So I need to have a job that can at least help cover our bills while I am going back to school. I would like to get into something like an internship where I can start gaining electrical engineering experience while also going to school(internship). 

However I would have to find this job before starting school so I can make sure that my schedule is able to accommodate my class schedule.

My theory is that this would alleviate much of the problem caused by low rail adhesion in autumn, and even if the pads needed replacing every week or so, surely this could be designed around to lower the cost to an equal or lesser amount than the current format?

21,Strengthening steel table base,1509500554,"Hi. I've built a table base which consist of steel tubing. Basically a large rectangle (80cm x 200cm) onto which I'm gonna screw a wooden table top. Tubes are 40mm x 20mm x 2mm. Because of height reasons, I had to put them flat (40 side down), which increases the bend in the middle. When it's just the table top there aren't any issues (zero bending), but I want a table I can sit or stand on in the middle without anxiety.

My question is, would I be able to decrease bending by adding 3 supports between the two 200's? So one at 50, at 100 and 150. Or is this gonna do nothing since they're still attached to the 200's who are bending atm? Adding legs in the middle is not an option unfortunately.

The 3,000 is in seconds, just so that it's close to terminal velocity after ""a long time"". The 50 is in kilograms. .18 is my CdA, and .905 is Rho at 10,000ft on a standard day.

But... I want to further simplify the equation to just being the relationship between terminal velocity down a slope (Θ) versus weight of the person.

 I know this assumes no friction and no change in altitude, etc. I just want to know the relationship between different weights and max speed on a given slope. That way we can figure out if it's even worth it for us all to try or just concentrate on making our 220lb friend as aerodynamic as possible by reducing his CdA and helping him practice.

42,Career advice for a PhD moving from microelectronics to oil and gas,1509454843,"Hello,

I'm hoping that someone here can help with some career advice (that I don't really want to link to my normal account).

My engineering degree and masters are both pretty much materials science and I've recently finished my PhD in microelectronics. My project was very applied as I worked in process integration and electrical characterization in a large semiconductor fab. I enjoyed the work and believe that I was pretty good at it.

I will soon be moving to Kazakhstan for a few (4-7) years  in order to follow my wife who needs to go back home for a little while. Since there isn't really any microelectronics industry there I will need to find another job and I'm thinking that working in oil and gas might be an option. I don't (yet) speak Russian or Kazakh, but I did my PhD in my second language that I picked up during my masters so I'm confident I'll pick it up quickly.

Does anyone have experience with moving into oil and gas from a specialization that wasn't so relavent? Or with a professional move to Kazakhstan?

Is this a case where I'd be better off hiding the PhD and applying as a materials engineer? Most of my time was spent in the company anyway, so I could simply say that I was a process integration engineer.",AskEngineers,eng_microelec_gas,/r/AskEngineers/comments/79vk3t/career_advice_for_a_phd_moving_from/
43,Get into engineering they said. You'll get a great job they said.,1509450207,"A little background:

Mechanical Engineering has been my focus since I was 8 years-old. My grandpa convinced me of it back then in 2003. I was going to be apart of the future in automotive, move over to the big Motor City, and accomplish just that fact. The American-made ones, the ""Big 3"" as they call it over here.

Well I did exactly that. I graduated high school and headed over 2 hours west to Montana State, where I would put myself through school. Looking back, I had quite a miserable experience, I simply was so focused too much on my workout regime (bodybuilding) and work through the local beer distributor that I forgot to enjoy myself. I graduated this May with a 3.1 in mechanical with a mechatronics minor. Being from Montana and without any industry, internships were hard to come by. I also had to keep close-by to aid the family construction business. Mistake #1. 

I packed my truck and headed east. Literally out of the blue, no connections, no future housing, no future job, just determined. I topped out a credit card searching, and at last, a non-engineering, contracted position doing instrumentation on 2019-22 Ford prototypes. A month later, laid off due to seasonal lack of work. 

I cannot get my resume (with no automotive experience) on these guys' desks. These ATS's are making a fool of me and literally every networking connection seems to burn out. Ambitious but not qualified. I'm reaching out because my bags are packed, and I'm headed home. Does anyone become successful grinding and following their goals in life? I have talent, I know this but does it simply come down to meeting the right person at the right time?

54,Dust Collecting - Water Treatment System,1509390388,"This is probably a question for an environmental engineer.  I'm looking to optimize the water treatment system of the stone shop that I work in.  It's a wet shop where water collects the dust from cutting and polishing stone, draining into a long ditch running along the wall of the shop.  There is a shallow slope in the ditch allowing gravity to hopefully pull some of the dust down to the bottom as water flows along.  The end drains at ground level into a sunken settling tank with a sump pump at the bottom which pumps water back into the filtration system.  The settling tank overflows at ground level into a secondary tank which in turn overflows into a mud pit.  

This system was drafted by a local company a few years back and I am new to this job, but this seems like a rather strange way to go about doing this.  I think that the dust is mostly getting carried back into the filtration system due to the pump placement instead of settling and caking.  This is leading to more frequent than necessary halts in production in order to clean the filter system.  Would raising or moving the pump into the secondary tank help?  Would changing the point of overflow between the tanks help if we moved the pump from the primary to the secondary overflow tank?

61,Should I stay in electrical engineering or switch to mechanical engineering?,1509372563,"One month ago I began my studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the best engineering school of my country. However some months before that I couldn’t make a decision between Mechanical Engineering and this course. Now, after picking EE I’m starting to have some doubts.

So here’s my story: since a kid I have always loved to learn how things worked. Instead of moving the toys around like most kids I just grabbed the cars and stared at the wheels, spinning them and examining how they worked. So my family always knew I would be an engineer. I loved bending things to see when was the breaking point. I was also curious about electricity and I always understood how important and dangerous it was (I respected it to the point of never trying to place a finger on a socket).

At high school I excelled at physics, and my best grades were when we studied kinematics and all the forces involved with the movement of an object. By then I was interested in biomedical engineering but my physics tutor kept saying “you would be great studying mechanical engineering” and I started liking the idea. Then came year 12 and I had 4 courses in mind: ME, EE, IT &amp; computer engineering and applied mathematics &amp; computing. After looking into it I excluded mathematics because it was too theoretical and I wanted to be an engineer. Later I excluded IT because I can’t imagine myself programming all day. ME had one thing that I have always hated: engines. And cars were never really my thing. About EE, well, I hate circuits and electronics. So I thought it was a tie?

Eventually I chose EE because I thought “well, it has a huge variety of specialisations and it’s not like I have to study electronics all the time”.

But now I miss thermodynamics, kinematics and all that. Sure I do have them in my course but only as a semestral subject in a whole 5 year course (bachelors and masters included). Sure logics can be interesting but I’m not enjoying the whole circuit thing (I hate connecting wires and all that). And I can’t skip to my masters to start studying energy or robotics, which is what I really want. I feel like I would enjoy the process of studying mechanical engineering much more than studying electrical engineering, although in the end I can use any of them for my final purpose. My instinct was to study ME but I ended up here somehow...

What do you think? Should I consider switching to ME? Will I be happier there? Despite not fancying engines and cars, could I go through that easier than I would with electronics and hardware? Any help would be appreciated.

""The basic organization of the hypothalamic-pituitary-endocrine axis is summarized in Figure 38–1. Discrete sets of hypothalamic neurons produce different releasing hormones, which are axonally transported to the median eminence. Upon stimulation, these neurons secrete their respective hypothalamic releasing hormones into the hypothalamic-adenohypophyseal plexus, which flows to the anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamic releasing hormones bind to membrane receptors on specific subsets of pituitary cells and stimulate the secretion of the corresponding pituitary hormones. The pituitary hormones, which can be thought of as the master signals, then circulate to the target endocrine glands, where they again activate specific receptors to stimulate the synthesis and secretion of the target endocrine hormones. These interactions thus represent feed-forward regulation in which the master (signal) hormones stimulate the production of target hormones by the endocrine organs.""

This is an open call for people interested in joining our team.

##Requirements:

1. You must have **time.** AskEngineers is a heavily moderated sub that requires all mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but on others you'll have to spend up to an hour reading posts and messaging people. If you participate regularly, this should match closely to how much time you're already spending reading and writing comments, but all applicants should understand the time commitment required to moderate.

1. You must be familiar with the [**guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. After the recent update, they're designed to be read in ~10 minutes, so please do so as you apply. You must also support the underlying philosophy of AskEngineers:
 * Participate in and grow the subreddit as a place to discuss engineering.
 * Maintain the subreddit as an open platform for discussion, free from censorship of ideas and opinions.
 * Foster an environment of fact- and evidence-based learning, and shared experiences in the engineering profession.

67,Aircraft Simulator Yoke Design,1509336813,"[Photo's](https://imgur.com/a/NrJ7N) I am wondering if anyone has any ideas for how to improve flight simulator yoke feel and response. For starters the yoke has to move freely in the Y direction recentering on the axis when you let go. Simultaneously it needs to rotate along the Y access while returning to center when released. Typically  this is done by having a sliding shaft and attaching one spring to either side(shown in the second photo), these springs are then attached to a fixed point and recenter the yoke in both directions. These have two problems: they don't feel right because if you are moving in two directions the spring tension increases.They also have problems with centering repeatability.
Does anyone know of another mechanical way to recenter the yoke that might eliminate these problems while not creating a hard center detent? The yoke should move 4 inches (2 each way) in the Y direction and ~60 to 90 degrees each direction in roll. I have tested using torsion springs and a single extension spring for the roll. Gas springs and opposing extension springs for the Y direction with no luck. One consideration is that the handle will be roughly 12 inches from the mechanism.

I'm domiciled in an upper southern state (think KY, TN, AL, MS, AR states), so my COL is fairly low compared to where I'm originally from (MA). I feel that $60k/yr is decent for a graduate straight out of college, and I am absolutely sure that those hired after me are starting out at $61k-$63k now. With my COLA, I've been bumped to $61.5k and am expecting the company's policy for promotional increases, which will get me near $66k/yr. From what I've been told during my 1-year incumbency, I've been doing outstanding work learning all the FARs related to my job and have been progressing incredibly fast compared to those previous in my spot that have since left. With my MS that they only count as 1-year's worth of work experience with no monetary adjustment, I want to heavily consider arguing for a pay adjustment come my submission of my promotion paperwork.

Based on my work experiences and progression, do you think asking for $75k/yr is too much based on my tenure? I've read about negotiation tactics in the past and feel that I should anchor a little higher than I actually want and meet in the middle (I'd be happy with 71k-72k). I am already in process of compiling a list of my accomplishments and further work plans to significantly increase output in my role as the most green engineer on the team. I aspire to potentially apply as a DER myself later on down the road since I am content on working towards being an expert on aircraft structures.

I have thought about getting job offers elsewhere, but I've just moved 1300 miles away from my home-state for this job and don't want to commit too much into the idea of moving again so soon. So I'd like some feedback if my logic makes sense and would like to be compensated fairly for the kind of work I am performing.

Thank you for your time.

69,Is common for the best funded work in defense to be “fake”?,1509334424,"I’ve been working in defense for a couple of years now, and I’ve noticed a trend.  In the groups that have the best funding, which the management has appointed to be the experts in some area,  the engineers are not capable of actually delivering a working item, nor seem to be interested in learning how to, or any form of improvement.  Instead they spend their time making sure the organizational politics is on their side so that they can continue to maintain their funding, and be insulated from any failure that result from their lack of knowledge.  

The group that I work in normally works with some of these groups on projects in which they take the lead - because they got the funding.  Even though we are less funded by an order of magnitude, we have to consistently check their work.  When we point out some kind of major flaw in their designs, they shrug their shoulders, laugh, and get defensive.  They’ll either blame the problem on us, or use excuses like (“we need to get this to the warfighter”, “we’ve done it before”, etc.”)  I try to get them to justify their decisions, but it falls on deaf ears, or they get even more defense.  I find it is especially worse for me, since I try not to be good-old-boy, and don’t go out to lunch, or play after-work sports with the guys.

So I write up some report with recommendations, and go and work on other things.  I’ve found at this point it’s not worth my time to really argue.  Many months later I find the project has failed - for the reasons I pointed out.  Months after that I find the other group has received even more funding, while ours is getting cut.

It’s almost as if the winning strategy is to a) get appointed to be some expert, b) appear to do the work, but fail on purpose for the funding, c) defend your reputation by gaslighting your way out of issues, and being cronies with the right people.  And this is the best way to get funding and move up in your career.

I guess I’m wondering just how prevalent this kind of behavior is.

84,"Question about tire pressures, tire sizes, and how they affect abs/traction control systems",1509240557,"When it comes to choosing tires and tire pressures on cars, if I am going to go with tires that are wider than the stock tires, is there a formulaic way to determine at what pressure the new wider tires should be?

&amp;nbsp;

I posted this in another subreddit and got a few answers. The closest I saw was something similar to Boyle's law where P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. The only difference was that instead of volume, the person suggested substituting the millimeter number of the tread width in place of volume on the tires instead to find the new pressure. Would this be a correct method of figuring it out? Since volume uses the same formula, I thought this formula could work, but I would like to confirm.

&amp;nbsp;

The second question that I had is, with regard to traction control and anti-lock braking systems, I would guess that those are built by the manufacturer with a specific tire circumference and other things like angular momentum in mind. There could also be other factors that I'm not considering. With that being said, would it be unwise to choose a different tire width with a different tire aspect ratio, but with the same rim diameter size (as the stock tires) for a new set of tires on my car?

7,Curious about civil engineering.,1509124752,"Hi. I am currently working as a wellsite geologist/geochemist in the energy industry. Although I really love geology, I really don’t like the work very much. I spend weeks on end in parts of the country I really don’t like (particularly West Texas). I’ve thought about getting my masters, but I work with quite a few folks that have theirs that do the exact same work as I do.  Plus the boom and bust of the market is aggravating to say the least. 

I am having serious thoughts about going back to get a civil engineering degree with a focus in environmental engineering. I feel that this would be a good fit for me. I found a solid program and my Dad is good friends and work colleagues with the department head of a really good engineering school. I’m fairly close to getting the degree with the credits I’ve obtained in my geology degree. I think that I could get the degree in about two years. 

I’m curious how some of the civil/environmental engineers like the work that they do. What is the job like? How much do you travel? I’m looking for something that is about 80% office and 20% field work. What is the job outlook like from your perspective? Id like to work in a state office or something similar. 

Most of all, do you find the work fulfilling? Do you feel good about what you do at the end of the day?

**First question**, I have been studying Mathematics in my spare time trying to bring my self up to a standard so i can understand the Courses. Does anyone have any good resources for Maths and then Physics?

**Second question**, the University that i will be applying to (once up to a standard capable of doing the course) only has Majors in Chemical, Civil, Electrical and Mechanical. However i would like to focus more on Aerospace as a goal. Is Mechanical ""greatly"" different to Aerospace where it would perhaps impact the jobs I would be eligible for later?

And finally **Third question**, though i have been telling myself that my age really doesn't matter, is there anyone with a similar experience that can boost my confidence? I worry that i may never understand the maths or that by the time i finish my degree my age will impact employment etc.

23,I'm concerned I may have ventured into a potential ethics violation,1509071383,"This is my first major solo project for my company. I am registered the professional engineering society in my area. I was tasked to oversee and direct consultants in determining the any environmental concerns on a large number of sites we operate on but do not own. These contracts are worth billions. All correspondence relevant to this project are being vetted by a team of lawyers from multiple firms. 

We split up the sites and sent proposal requests to multiple consulting firms. During the proposal period one of the consultants proposed that a more thorough investigation than requested should be performed due to the activities that take place on these sites. It was decided by one of the lawyers that all the sites should undergo the same level of investigation and a statement was prepared that would direct all consultants to include this enhanced criteria in their proposals.

Shortly after the statement was sent an email was sent to myself and some VPs of my company that excluded the lawyers stating that including these investigations could dig up some issues that we would have to pay to remediate and stating that we should exclude the investigation from this project so we are not responsible for remediation costs. The project has been frozen pending a meeting tomorrow.

If they ask me to narrow the scope of the investigation so that these potential concerns do not arise is this an ethics issue? If so what's my course of action?

58,"I'm sure this gets posted a lot, but I'm a first year engineering student that needs to declare a major soon and I'm stressed out.",1508991537,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm Canadian, so job markets will be different than America. 

I'm a student at UBC (University of British Columbia) where I have the choice of Mechanical, Civil, or Electrical. I can also transfer schools to major in Mining. 

**Mechanical**

It seems like almost the vast majority of engineers are mechanicals because it's the most transferable. I'm not very interested in mechanical because, I don't mean to offend, but the average salary is lower than other majors, and I feel like there's a higher likelihood that I will get stuck in a job I dislike.

**Civil**

This is what I'm leaning towards because the average salary is higher than mechanical, and job growth looks good. It's impossible to offshore a civil engineer and infrastructure is always growing. I also hear jokes about civil being the 'easiest major' which is an added bonus.

**Electrical**

I'm probably least likely to go into electrical because the math doesn't quite connect with me. If I did end up in as an electrical I would likely try to get into industrial or robotics/ mechatronics. 

**Mining**

It's my understanding that mining is a shrinking industry in America but as an exporting country, mining is still pretty large in Canada. The money is comparable with petroleum but I feel like it's more stable in the long run. The main reason I'm not dead set on mining is that transferring schools is very competitive. My girlfriend of three years is also not able to transfer from her program. (She's in nursing.) If I was really dead set on mining and I made the cut for a transfer, I would have to consider making the decision to pursue my education instead of opting for a major I enjoy less. 



I have been using [this resource](https://engineerscanada.ca/sites/default/files/Labour-Market-2015-e.pdf) to help me decide where to go, but I'm feeling very overwhelmed. I feel like I don't know enough to make a decision that will affect my entiure career.

Please excuse the many typos as I tried to write this quickly so I can get back to studing.

There are testers who continuously test the product and report any problems they encounter. Usually, if a tester reports a problem and it works its way to my manager, they will call me in to investigate the issue.

I'll investigate the issue, determine the root cause, determine if there is a flaw in the design, assess the risk, and then send a summary email over to my manager. My manager responds pretty quickly.

However, if I do independent investigations into where I think they may be problematic issues that aren't low risk, my manager never responds to my reports unless I keep being a nuisance. I feel like this has been going on for more than a year. Sometimes the issues even manifest by themselves and I am asked to investigate.

So to summarize, I feel like my manager ignores me unless they specifically task me to look into something.

Or are they directly connected to the TCM?

2.  In some cars in ""sport mode"" 'manual mode' when the revs get too high or low, the transmission shifts automatically. Does the TCM make that decision because it's receiving the RPM data or does the ECU send a shift command to it?

69,In Need of Solutions for a Project at Work (Calcium Proofing a Staircase),1508963596,"Hey fellow engineers! I'm a junior civil engineer working on a system of locks in North-America with the SLSMC (Saint-Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation). I was recently tasked with ""calcium proofing"" a staircase. Water always finds it's way in the galleries running along the lenght of the locks, it seeps thru the concrete ""roof"" and the winter de-icing salts get mixed in and the end result is we get a steady flow of calcium accumulating down there. We have calcium catching drains running the lenght of the gallery but there is this one spot in the gallery where there is a staircase and the calcium regularly blocks a pipe meant to transfer the drain to the bottom of the staircase. This makes the calcium cover the whole staircase in a matter of weeks. This is dangerous for the maintenance crews working in the galleries as they can slip/slide by stepping on the calcic muck. We have to order clean-up crews with vaccum trucks and pressured water to remove the accumulation every few months and this is becoming a hassle. As for solutions, I was thinking of sanding/removing a 1mm layer off the top of the concrete steps to get to some ""good"" concrete, after having removed all the visible calcium of course, and applying a hydrophobic coating on each step. Since the calcium is initialy carried by the water, if the water can't sit around because it's being repeled by the hydrophobic coating then it would all end up at the bottom of the stairs making the stairs safer and making cleaning up the muck easier. This is all I've been able to come up with so far... Ideally we should try solving calcium at the source but we would have to rebuild the whole lock to achieve that... The lock system is more than 60 years old and the concrete making methods back then weren't what they are now... Anyway, if any of you have dealt with calcium before or have any solutions to throw around feel free to discuss! Here is a [picture of said staircase covered in calcium](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-mPHsgMmxMaTE03UmRQeUwxUWM) not sure if link to the picture will work, PM me if it doesnt I'll try to put it up on imgur later tonight.

So, I'll just leave a list of points and you'll hopefully find the right category of degrees/jobs which'll be right for me:

- I've taken Maths, Physics and Chemistry as my 3 subjects in A-Levels.

- I'm not fond of Chemistry or Math but I **love** Physics.

- I love tinkering with electronics (preferably laptops, desktops and computer peripherals), opening them up, unplugging the connections and examining the PCBs, the methods of thermal dissipation for heat generating electronic and other things like that.

- I hate the idea of sitting down and writing down thousands of lines of code, I like writing in general (stories) but dislike anything relating to C++, Python, HTML or anything else in line with those things.

- I love being engrossed by enthusiast-class products like Nvidia's Quadro line of GPUs, Intel's Xenon line of CPUs, mechanical-switch-workings in keyboards, mouse-sensor-workings in mice, drivers and technology used in Audiophile-grade headphones.

71,Hardware Safety vs Software Safety,1508948215,"A little bit of background here, we are designing the controls for a small machine and we are currently working on the pcb layout. It involves some safety switches and sensors but an interesting question came up and it's been hard to actually find information/standards on this.

When are you implementing safeties is it better to do it on the hardware side or the software side? For example, lets say you have a ""Start' button and and ""E-stop"" button, there are 2 ways you could implement this.

1) Using a logic gate and running the output into a microcontroller (""Start"" &amp; ""E-stop off"" using a AND gate then running that output to a microcontroller)

2) Have two inputs in the microcontroller (one for ""Start"" and one for ""E-stop"") and using software to check that the safety conditions are met.

What do you guys think the pros and cons of each are and why?

Edit 1: This is more from a machine safety standpoint than an operator safety standpoint.

I would follow [this Reddit comment's](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/185992/pipe_flow_solving_strategy/c8bq3tw/) advice about using a friction assumption to find velocity, then checking the turbulence with the Reynold's number. 

Does my calculation need to be that in-depth (finding velocity section by section)? Is the method correct?

2,Advice on career/study path,1508833158,"Hi everyone!
I'm new to Reddit so I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct sub-reddit for this kind of post, if not please point me to a more adequate now.
I'm 21, originally from Italy, I lived in the UK for a while and now I've been living in Australia for about a year.
I've always enjoyed studying and practicing on IT related stuff, any kind. I started when I was 15, working in a computer shop, when I got to know and love everything on an hardware prospective.
Then, I studied programming in PHP, Javascript, C++ and Python(which by now I have probably almost entirely forgot).
But of all things, what I always liked most was Security(Penetration Testing/Ethical Hacking) and all Linux/Open Source related things, which I have been studying for the past 2/3 years as a self-taught.
However, I never got an actual degree as I went to an electrical engineering school and realised too late that was not for me, so I decided to still get the diploma.
Now, I'm working in IT here, and since the company I work for is pretty small, I get to do all kinds of things, from project managing to pre sales engineering and PHP programming.
So as I am sort of ""stuck"" here, I can't go to Uni due to the exorbitant University fees for foreign students and I probably wouldn't have time anyway. Therefore, I was just thinking to wait for a couple of years until I get my PR and I can enroll for university at a resonable price.
I guess my only other option would be to enroll for an online university that is located somewhere in europe, and then take the master degree here(which I am guessing is more relevant), but I have no idea if:
1) I can actually even enroll for an online university without being in that country.
2) If I could ask for a government Loan being a EU citizen like I would if I were in an actual university.
3) If an online degree is actually valid and considered legit by emloyers or they are gonna snob you cause you have one.
I'm still confused about what degree+master I should go for, I guess the best way would be an IT/Computer Science bachelor degree and a Cyber Security master(as well as all the certification you need to do this job).
I'm aware there are also bachelor degrees on Cyber Security but at that point I guess my career could only point in one direction, whereas with a general IT one, I could still change job position if I wanted to.
I would really appreciate if some of you would spend some time to answer to this post and advice on how I should proceed as I'm totally confused.

BS Mechanical Engineering from large Public State School - ABET accredited
EIT certification
Graduated 2014
Male white 27 yo


I have been working in upstream Oil and Gas since graduation, about 3 years as a Petroleum Engineer, focusing on Reserve analysis, well completion and production techniques. I also spent some time initially as a Field Engineer running petrophysical measurement logs in newly drilled Oil and Gas wells. 

I have grown to really dislike this industry. I never really intended to go into this field (or I would have majored in petroleum)— it just kinda happened to me. 

I badly want to switch to a mechanical or project engineer type role. I would love to work in the renewable energy space (wind would be ideal as there is a ton of wind in my home state-where I want to live).  I believe I would enjoy a job in the construction/civil space. I really think I would crush a sales engineering role as well. 

The problem is, I don’t here back from every job I apply for, which has been a very considerable amount of applications and cover letters.  The amount of time and energy I have spent looking and applying for jobs the last 6 months has been staggering. The lack of activity is becoming very disheartening. 

Do people here think my experience has pigeonholed me into petroleum and made recruiters just not at all interested in me? 
Is there any online certifications or skills/projects I could do to aid in my intended career switch?

I’m really at a loss for what to do and having a quarter life crisis.

I wish to get into Process Engineering in the Chemistry / Chemical Engineering field, and would like to know what the best pathway to that goal is.

My experiences and credentials are listed below.

* Graduated in 2016 as a non-traditional student in my late 20s a with Bachelors in Chemistry (no specialization) from a large university in the Northeast Coast, with a Final GPA of 2.9.

* My previous work experience unrelated to my current job was working for a few years as a Pharmacy Tech, and nearly a year in a GLP lab.

* Previous work experience related to chemistry work involved working for two years in a paid internship for a chemicals company. I did this work during my last two years of university, working and studying concurrently. One of the major projects I did there was to research various manufacturers to help the company purchase some analysis equipment. My work convinced upper management to purchase three instruments for their production sites, with more purchases to be considered.

* The internship listed above helped me to get my first professional job working with the same company, but at a different location. I am currently working with heterogeneous catalysts, and have been working here for close to 1.5 years now.

* I've learned so far how to do hardware troubleshooting of a GC and for a small lab-scale reactor, making both fluidized bed catalysts &amp; carbon-supported catalysts, doing health &amp; safety inspections of the lab, and will be learning how to do IQ/OQ for new lab equipment.

I really enjoy what I'm doing, and I've really loved doing the R &amp; D work and presenting my findings to my supervisors and middle management. I would really like to move into doing more Process Engineering; unfortunately, I see little room for advancement due to the small size of the lab. I am currently trying to learn some process engineering from the two process engineers, and hoping to assist them in doing more pilot-scale scaleups of catalysts, but I need to focus mainly on my assigned work tasks.

Right now, I am doing a preliminary job search, looking for any positions for Junior Process Engineers that don't require a Chemical Engineering degree. Unfortunately, those positions are very few and far in between. I don't mind going for at the least a Masters in either ChemE or Materials Science Engineering, but I worry about not being too competitive with my lacking GPA. I hope to overcome that deficiency with two good recommendations from my current manager and my previous technical manager from my internship, along with aiming for 85%+ for both sections of the GRE. Lastly, I am still debating whether I would like to just finish with a Masters, but would still consider doing a Doctorate; my only worry with the latter option being the opportunity cost of the Doctorate.

Ideally, I'd love to make a transition to being a Process Engineer, and hopefully learning plenty on the job without currently needing a postbaccalaureate degree in engineering at the moment. I'm hoping that with the experience as a Process Engineer, I may be able to go back for an advanced degree and command a higher salary. I'd also hope to work as a researcher or just stay in a technical track wherever I go, and prefer to avoid being placed in a managerial position. I am also really loving what I am learning about catalysis, and a lot of questions to be explored in catalyst optimization, so I would love to potentially stay in the field of catalysts, but I do know it is small, and that I may be limiting myself with being specialized so early in my career.

27,How do you return to college for a STEM related degree without it being such an opportunity cost at a later age?,1508713095,"I am a self-taught web programmer, with an unrelated bachelor's degree, who has been doing this work professionally for several years. I am now 35 years old. But I want to shift gears into another field of programming. I want to do lower-level work, closer to the metal. I assume I cannot get into doing robotics or embedded work simply by being self-taught so I am considering returning to school for a Master's degree (or maybe a second bachelor's) in CS, CE, or EE.

But it's not as easy the second time around. The problem is that it's a bigger opportunity cost than it used to be. Back when I was in my early 20's I was able to take up to 6 years to get my Bachelor's degree because I lived with my parents and had to pay nothing for rent. 11 years later, I cannot continue to live with them, as they'll be heading back to Central America soon and retire there. I'm not in a financially better situation than I was when I graduated, and there's no one else in my family that'll take me, and no friends either.

So if you've been in a similar situation, having taken a CS degree when you're much older, little money in the bank, and no one available to live with, how did you do it? What if you don't have an employer that can pay for your degree? Did you have to leave your full-time job and work some menial soul-sucking job to make ends meet? I would think it's even more humbling to do that as you reach your middle age years.

I'm still not certain where to take an online degree program or not. But I want it to be in a good enough school where I can at least get the chance to intern at great companies that do a lot of robotics or embedded work.",AskEngineers,degreeth1234321,/r/AskEngineers/comments/783mul/how_do_you_return_to_college_for_a_stem_related/

29,Calculating drag on a rocket,1508708496,"So I'm in an aerospace class at my high school, and my teacher is trying to plan a rocket that will go to space. We don't have the money to build it yet, but we're going to design it this year and let next year's class build it, if he can get the money by then. Anyway, he's busy working with the people who haven't taken this class last year, and doesn't have much time to help us. 

The rocket will have two stages, but the second one doesn't have a motor, it just detaches so it can go higher.

The main problem I have is that the drag equation is very complicated, and requires an even more complicated pressure equation to work. Then I'll have to work these into the equation for thrust, and use an integral to solve it. But I can't figure out how to actually do that. 

I did take Cal 1 Junior year, so I do understand basic calculus, but I'm still stuck. Right now I have estimates of the Cd, impulse and weight, so I should be able to figure out both thrust and drag, or at least get equations that I can work with, right? 

I know this is complicated, but any help is appreciated. I'll update if I learn anything else. 

Here's a read-only version of my spreadsheet. Its not finished yet, and the pressure part is obviously wrong, but it'll probably be helpful for y'all if you're trying to help me.

55,Data rate relation to signal attributes,1508623464,"Hey I tried getting answers in the AskComputerScience section but I was recommended to this section. 

I am learning about communications signals and as I have understood it some of the attributes change the properties of the communication signal in the following ways:
Higher Fundamental Frequency gives us higher Data Rate and Higher bandwidth.


Higher Bandwidth either gives us a higher Fundamental Frequency and thereby a higher Data Rate OR it gives us more Frequency Components and higher Accuracy but lower Data Rate.


Increase in Frequency Components increases the Bandwidth and Accuracy but lowers the Data Rate.


Higher Bandwidth also increases the Cost of the transmission system.


I am bit confused about the Bandwidth because I am told that Bandwidth increases the Data Rate, but it seems like it only increases Data Rate if the number of Frequency Components are unchanged. On the other hand the Fundamental Frequency of the signal determines the overall frequency for the composite signal and thereby the Data Rate. Wouldn't it be more correct to say that the fundamental frequency of the composite communication signal determines the data rate?

Here is a link to a lecture I have been following: https://youtu.be/ZS3JxGJWsUA?t=26m32s He is explaining how bandwidth and number of components of a composite signal affect the data rate. He is just about to explain that adding a third component will halve the data rate and make the signal accuracy better, with accuracy he means that it will be easier for the receiver to interpret the different signal element levels . But we see that by adding a third component, still having a fix bandwith of 8MHz (like the signal with only two components), we still get a change in data rate. So same bandwidth can equal different data rate. If we however look at the fundamental frequency of each of those two signals it seems like this is the deciding factor of what determines the data rate. Because the composite signal will have the frequency of the fundamental frequency and if I understand correctly this is what limits the data rate, the number of periods we can fit within a second. The fundamental frequency is higher for the signal with 2 components and lower for the signal with 3 components.

69,interview regarding a datacenter hvac two weeks from now. Advice? ME here,1508555022,"Hello,

I am a bachelors in mechanical engineering, and I have an interview coming up in two weeks with a company that specializes in hvac and datacenter design. Now, I have not taken any courses in hvac, and I do not know how this interview will go. I am having a lot of anxiety, since I do not know what questions they will ask and I cannot find much in glassdoor. Also, it seems like they will definitely ask technical questions since the recruiter said I should prepare very well. My thermodynamics knowledge isnt the strongest :(

My anxiety is through the roof, but can anyone advise what I can focus on for this interview? This will be a technical interview, it is an entry level position. Again, it is geared towards HVAC and datacenter design. Can anyone please advise what to expect or what to remember for the interview?

70,Liquid Injection Question,1508544335,"I have been designing a system to have your car automatically washed at home, with a storage friendly design. One of the questions that have seemed to stump my google inquiries, is having different liquids being injected in different phases of cleaning (pre-wash solvent, surfacants, and glazes/waxes). The idea so far is basically a linear system (much like a 3d printer) that hooks up to a hose and pressure washes your vehicle. 

What kind of  components/parts would be needed to incorporate a multi-phase injection system? We would have each in individual cartridges (plastic bottles really) that would connect (like plug into) the water line and be put through onto the vehicle. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Our dilemma has been getting it started. We've put together a requirements doc similar to the engineering process, I think... I'm hoping to send this outline to a mechanical engineer first so he can create a few sketches for a prototype. The next step is to send the mechanical prototype to an electrical engineer who can put together a circuit to fit within the mechanical version. 

My questions are: 

* 1. Does this process sound right?

* 2. What do engineers need document wise to get started on a problem
a. Would you advise me to outsource this project to a Fiverr freelancer, or b. Would it make sense to reach out to a few of the universities around me and see if engineering students would want an extra project to work on and get paid? 

* 3. How can i keep costs as low as possible? I've had a phone case idea that a CAD designer made and charged me $500 for... does that sound accurate?

81,What File Management/PDM Solutions do you guys use?,1508504662,"Hey guys,

My company is (finally, in my opinion) starting to look into getting a better file management solution together than Windows Explorer and lots of Hyphenated file names/folders. I've searched around a little bit and learned from some of our customers what they use, but was hoping to cast a wider net to see what kind of software other folks use.

Our first foray was looking into SolidWorks' integrated PDM solution, which would work great for our of our internal prints/parts which are built in Solidworks. Unfortunately, outside customer prints typically only come in as PDFs/DWGs/STEP files, and solidworks pdm doesn't want to play nice with any file that doesnt have a master Part/Assembly file to tie itself to.

This led us to investigating Adept, which appears to be what the SolidWorks solution is based off of, but without the SolidWorks-only limitations. That's what we're leaning towards right now.

We're a fairly average sized machine shop so it's not like we're managing Millions of Files with dozens of revisions a piece, but there's enough revisions to jobs-in-progress that a lack of any kind of check in/check out or revision control has caused a few mistakes, ranging from minor eyerolls to thousands of dollars in scrapped material.

Well is there AC power to my whole house and I guess the way I under stand electricity is that its a loop, it comes in and then out. Well if i turn on my lamp in my house, it uses electricity and then some value of usage appears on the meter... how does this work? Is it measuring the difference between what is coming in vs what is coming out?

I guess secondary question, is I understand that all wires have some resistance, does that mean if all the electronics/devices that use power in my house are unplugged, would I still be ""using"" power just by all the wiring in my walls throughout the house?

My first idea was to have one fan facing the thing and one one the other side facing away.  One pushing and one pulling the air.  I sealed them off with paper and tape so it was like a tube with little air escaping.  I know that I can't double the flow rate because the blades spin at a given rate but I thought I could at least improve on just having one.  And I did, but I don't understand why.  The thing didn't get so hot and it cooled quicker like this.

I also tried both blowing from the same side and this was worse (Thing got hotter and took longer to cool down).  It was worse even than just having one blowing.  I assume the turbulence from each was interfering with the other probably down to where I put them.  I don't know much about air flow and fans (as is obvious by now).

What should I be doing to cool my hot thing and why did having one pushing and one pulling work so well when it doesn't actually make sense (to me)?

Recently I was put in charge of the lifting engineering department on my workplace.

The code for gantry cranes (B30.2) doesn't even say anything about a load rate.

2,How do I understand Fresnel Reflection at a dielectric magnetic interface?,1508423530,"
For non-magnetic media when light is travelling from material (1) to material (2) the Fresnel reflection coefficient is r = (n1-n2)/(n1+n2) where n is the refractive index, written in terms of the permittivity and permeability: n = SQRT(epsilon*mu). A similar expression can be written in terms of wave impedance: r = (Z2-Z1)/(Z1+Z2) where Z=Z0SQRT(mu/epsilon). These expressions do not seem equivalent - am I mistaken?

14,Fired From First Job...Career Options Advice?,1508361498,"Hello Everyone!

I am a Chemical Engineer (graduated in 2016). I was let go from my job as a process engineer at a pharmaceutical company in August. I worked there 9 months, learned a lot, and gained good experience! I loved my job and my coworkers.

I've been fighting with depression since high school and have been able to overcome any of those feelings. This year my depression came back in full intensity. As a result, my performance at work suffered as did my relationship with my manager. 

Since then, I've really bounced back! I've made adjustments to my lifestyle and have recovered from my depression. I've been looking for jobs since August with several phone interviews but nothing more. I'm searching for jobs across the country being open minded about industry, location, and pay. At this point, I'm just looking for experience to grow my career. My ideal job would be working on PLCs/Automation. I've also been studying for the FE and plan to take the test in December. 

I'm concerned that I will not get hired as an engineer again. What can I do to get my career on track? I've attached my resume as a reference. I'm looking for any advice or guidance as to what I should do.

As of now, the plane will be about 20lbs, have a wingspan of about 84 inches, wing chord of 14 inches, which equates to a wing loading of around 2.3 lb/ft^2. We'd like the cruise speed to be around ~35 mph if possible, which means keeping the stall as low as possible. Basically, with an aircraft of these specifications, will it fly?

27,Looking for a geometric tolerancing reference table of expected values based on the machining process,1508338795,"I am looking to any kind of reference material that would outlined the expected/possible/achievable geometric tolerance figures for various machining processes. 

[Similar to how page 145 of this books shows the IT range for dimensional tolerances, is there something similar for geometric tolerances?](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FMqugijTMf0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=table%206.2%20machining&amp;f=false)

To be a little more specific about where this request comes from. SKF recommends that bearing housings should have a total runout of less than half of an IT5, which is exceptionally tight (4 microns for the shaft sizes I am working with). I assume that is going to require some additional operations after the initial turning. But would like to know what they might be and if there was some sort of wider reference that covered other tolerances as well then that would help.

Thanks.

**Edit:** To explain further. I am doing a massive design review and I am initially looking at the ‘special’ features of parts, such as bearing housings.

So while the starting point of looking into machine capability was for the bearing housing runout I am looking to expand this and ideally write some generic design guidelines of the back of what I have found thus far.

I am looking to have a short document that shows the design engineer and the review team which processes are required to achieve certain dimensional/geometric tolerances and surface finishes. I want to avoid over specifying parts by picking an requirement that is just out of reach of normal turning, milling or drilling. 

Sure if there is a good reason for needing a vibration polished part to 0.08 Ra then that is what will go on the drawing. But I don’t want to specify something that doesn’t improve the part but makes it considerably more expensive to make.

I work in R&amp;D at our production plant. My daily work often involves heading down to the production line to take a look at problems, and see if it is a design problem.

As such, I am often heading in juggling piles of paper drawings, my notebook, measuring equipment, tools, etc.

It's stupid and a handful. I'm looking to make it easier.

I want a tool pouch I can leave on my desk, and quickly strap to my belt when I need to go in. This pouch will contain my phone (camera), and measuring tools like calipers, measuring tape, flash light, etc. I will just carry my notebook by hand, and fold my drawings into my notebook.

Basically, I want a ""bug out"" pouch that is **scratch free** (these are still customer cars). If the problem requires more than what the pouch contains (voltmeter, etc.), then I'll just carry them separately. This pouch is only for the bare basics in measurement.

I'm working in the battery engineering department at a HUGE car manufacturing factory. My particular department focuses on ""cleanliness"" of the operators / machines and monitors what sort of contaminants we can pick up on the lines on sticky tabs and we run these through an EA8000 machine every 24 hours. Our ""active ingredients"" include Co, Cu and Ni, we categorize these into small and large micron particles. If Fe is found, it's ""alright"" if it's found with any/all of the active ingredients. However, if we see Fe and Cr, we know it's stainless steel and  it's a machine issue and could potentially cause shorts in the batteries. If there's Ca found, we mostly flag it as ""sand"", but Na, K, and Ca are categorized as ""human"" contaminants. Sometimes we find Ti or Al. Our tabs are put 

I am tasked with trying to compile the data and see if I can find any sort of trends over the last two years using the data I have access to. If I need to, I can rerun the contamination tabs and regather the data for small, large or micro partials. I was thinking of asking the operators what their cleaning/maintenance schedules have been over the last two years and how they've changed, but there's no guarantee that they've kept records of this information. I'm not sure what an ""excess"" of active ingredients found in the tabs would mean, or if we see too much cathode, or anode material would mean.

I have co-op experience in supply chain and three years of research experience in an academic Waste-to-Energy laboratory. By the time I graduate, I should have a publication under my belt.

I want to move out of the US as soon as possible, ideally within two years of earning my MS. Here are my requirements:

-**Walkable** - I intend to never drive a car again unless absolutely necessary

-**Large city** - The urban population should ideally be &gt;800k

-**Intellectual** - I like being surrounded by the best and brightest minds in the world. A sizable academic output and learning culture is highly desired. Boston’s been great for that so far. 

-**Non English-speaking population**: I'd *consider* England or Australia, but I'd prefer to live somewhere that'll give me some culture shock. As an addendum, English is the only language I know and I don't know the best way of going about moving to a place where you don't know the language. I've heard immersion is really the only way. Can anyone advise?

-**Coast** - Inland cities are dumb. Depending on the place I'm flexible on this but I'd highly prefer somewhere near a major shore.

That's pretty much it. I understand this disqualifies me from the majority of engineering opportunities, but that's why I'm posting here - what can I do to put myself in a better situation when the time comes to look for employment that matches my requirements, and how can I find that employment? Also, it seems like most engineering positions in certain African cities are mid-senior level, and there are like six of them for the entire city.

-Dakar, Senegal

-Seoul, South Korea

-Singapore

76,Should I change my major (Mechanical to computer)?,1508175805,"Hello r/AskEngineers,

I'm a current mechanical engineering student (mechatronics option, if it makes any difference), considering switching to computer engineering. I have spent quite a few hours searching on engineering related subreddits and other websites, but would like to finally have some direct advice regarding job/salary prospects of a ME vs CE. Grad school may happen in the future, but is not a consideration right after graduation.

Here are some of the reasons why I am considering the switch:

1.It seems that pretty much all sources, online or people around me, indicate that salary is going to be better with a computer related field. A good entry level salary is important to me. Oil and gas is a no for me.

2.I am currently doing a manufacturing internship, and I am not satisfied with my work. I understand that one internship tells barely a fraction of the whole story, with ME being such a broad field, but it is pretty much the only engineering work experience I have to base off so far.

3.From anecdotal sources, I seem to hear a lot that with ME, majority of the jobs are quite non-technical, and involves a lot of documentation/management as opposed to actual engineering, whereas with CE, the industry seems to match the expectation more. I would very much prefer technical jobs.

4.I'm finding that ME is more of a knowledge based field more than a skill based field. My preference is the other way, which CE seems to be.

5.There seems to be many more jobs in the computer field, even just looking for an internship.

6.I have enjoyed what limited experience I have had with programming/coding.

My concerns about the switch:

1.I am currently doing very well in ME, as far as grades are concerned. I am worried that I am making a switch without really knowing what's out there, and what's possible with ME. I am also worried that me doing well in ME will not correlate to how well I do in CE. All I have to go off at the moment to assess this is that I am good at math/physics, and I have taken an intro level programming course that I also did well in.

2.The switch will delay me by a year, and will also mean more tuition.

3.I hear a lot about how saturated CS/CE is becoming, and that the field is going to slow down.

4.I will be behind other CE students; I am going into third year as an ME, and if/when I switch, I will be onto my second semester of third year. I'll only have ME internships list on my resume applying for CE internships.

5.I still do like the things I'm learning at school in ME. I love designing moving things.

78,Second Bachelor's in Engineering Advice,1508170507,"&amp;nbsp;
Hello all and thank you for taking the time to consider this question. I am a 23-year-old pursuing a second bachelor’s in mechanical engineering with the goal of earning a master’s as well. I will provide some background information and ask for your opinions on choosing between two schools: Drexel or Colorado School of Mines. Both have pros and cons and I would appreciate any guidance you can offer. 

&amp;nbsp;

 My first bachelor’s was in biochemistry, and I worked for a year at a chemical plant in QC afterwards. This experience in addition to another with an engineering group during my first degree has convinced me that I should pursue a career in engineering. 

&amp;nbsp;

At this point I have spoken to many academic and practicing engineers and have determined the best course for success taking into account my financial situation and prior classes is to pursue a second bachelor’s as a transfer student, and then a master’s in a BS/MS program. I have already taken many prerequisites from my previous degree (calculus 1-3, linear systems, physics 1-2, chemistry 1-2, organic chemistry 1-2, python programming, circuits). My end goal is to practice in industry, not to stay in academia. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have been accepted as a transfer student to a few schools and I am deciding between Colorado School of Mines and Drexel University. 
&amp;nbsp;

###Drexel Pros
- Co-op program with three, 6 month paid co-ops built into the schedule
- Solid engineering program
- Graduate coop, for MS non-thesis with practice

&amp;nbsp;

###Drexel Cons
- Will take about 2 years longer due to co-ops and a start time this April instead of January 
- Not super enthusiastic about Philadelphia, though I am willing to live pretty much anywhere to pursue my goal

&amp;nbsp;
###CSM Pros
- Very rigorous and well-respected engineering program
- Availability of a 6-month paid co-op built into the schedule, though not mandatory
- More deeply connected to energy industries, which I am very interested in
- Golden Colorado seems like a lovely place to live. 
- More interesting MS with thesis research (to me) based on a survey of professor’s research and past theses
&amp;nbsp;

###CSM Cons
- Will have to retake physics I and II (They have specific requirements for the courses even though my previous courses were from an accredited program)
- No MS with practice option, either MS with thesis or non-thesis
- Might be able to do a graduate internship, but not as part of the official program

&amp;nbsp;

Generally, what the decision comes down to is spending an extra two years at Drexel over CSM due to co-ops, and the decision to pursue an MS thesis or non-thesis. I would like to hear your opinions on whether having more co-op time in school or more overall time in the workforce (graduating earlier) would be more productive. On one hand, it makes sense to start working as quickly as possible because I am behind on time as a second bachelor’s student. However, my initial success in finding a job may be benefited by having more co-op experience. Additionally, for practicing in industry would you recommend pursuing an MS thesis or non-thesis?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks again for taking the time.

The [M/S Al Salam Boccaccio 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_al-Salam_Boccaccio_98) got a seemingly ridiculous amount of height added along with sponsons, and later capsized due to water used to fight a fire. Photos at the [bottom of this page for a sister ship](http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/manzoni_1971.htm) show the transformation.

So, what's enabling this? Have engineers learned new tricks for making ships stable? Is this because of lighter materials and more efficient construction?  Are these newer ships with lots of superstructure less safe?",AskEngineers,is_reddit_useful,/r/AskEngineers/comments/76os0f/how_were_passenger_ships_able_to_have_increasing/

My thoughts are that this has supposedly gone on for 10+ years. If there was really a big problem with the material they were supplying, manufacturers would have noticed. Companies like Boeing would use the materials for their own in house testing and it things failed when they shouldn't have done, the analysis would have shown the material to be at fault.

2,[Q4ME] Gas Transmission Piston,1508103145,"It seems I've had an idea that I am the wrong kind of engineer to evaluate. 

For those of you who aren't familiar with the design of the [AR-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArmaLite_AR-15) rifle (the single most popular rife in the US), it's a semi-automatic (self-loading) rifle design that can be bought or built in a variety of different calibers. It's extremely modular and customizable, and selling parts for them is big business. 

The cycling mechanism works by one of two basic designs. 

The original **direct gas impingement** system simply routes hot gas from a pinhole near the end of the barrel back into the receiver, using its pressure to push back the carrier, unlocking the bolt, extracting the spent shell, and picking up a fresh one on the spring-powered return stroke...

[Like this.](https://www.ar15tactical.net/gas/direct%20impingement%20full.gif)

Now, needless to say, this has some disadvantages... you are regularly flooding your mechanical operating environment with heat and carbon waste, which degrades lubricant and generally gums things up. 

The alternative is one of a number of **short stroke gas piston** system designs, where the vented gas is routed into a pneumatic piston, which pushes an op-rod that strikes the bolt carrier and shoves it back.

[Thus.](https://ar15tactical.net/gas/gas%20piston%20full.gif)

While the illustration touts the advantages of that, there are also several drawbacks:

* The rod adds weight to the front of the rifle (which is where you don't want weight on a rifle). 
* There are more moving parts to fail. 
* The cycling impulse becomes less of a steady push, and more of sharp strike, which increases stress on certain parts within the bolt carrier. 

While tinkering with a gunsmithing task one day, [something occurred to me](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-03/26/19/enhanced/webdr05/anigif_enhanced-29941-1427413465-2.gif).

A pneumatic cylinder doesn't have to push a rod, does it? 

Can it not also push a volume of clean, cold air out of the other side? Somewhat like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Doppelwirkender_Zylinder_Funktionsprinziep.gif), but using the second port to as an output rather than an input. 

Then one could perhaps use a [reset spring](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Einfachwirkender_Zylinder_funktionsprinziep.gif) to refill the cylinder. 

This would allow the advantages of direct gas system:

* Light, simple, system
* Works with standard parts (bolt carrier, etc)
* more steady impulse

... plus the advantages of a piston:

* Clean operation
* Cold operation
* Adjustable gas pressure

Now, needless to say, there would be numerous design challenges in terms of pressure transfer, gas volume, reset, durability, etc. That's a given. 

What I'm wondering is if the idea is somehow fundamentally flawed in a way I haven't seen (because I'm the wrong sort of engineer), or if all of these things, and the things I have not thought to ask about, are most likely surmountable design challenges.

8,I started a new job as an embedded software engineer and I'm getting stressed out. Need advice.,1508086429,"I started a new job as an embedded software engineer a couple months ago and I started getting stressed out in the last couple weeks to the point that it's affecting my sleep. When I first started the job, I found out that this position became available because a senior engineer was moving to another department within the same company. I didn't think much of it but I later found out from the senior engineer that he could no longer deal with the pressure and the unorganized management and decided to move to a different department even though he was still interested in doing embedded software. I also found out from him that there were two other embedded software engineers before me that they hired to replace him. They were let go after a few months because the VP of Engineering thought they weren't good enough.

According to the senior engineer, the VP of Engineering has a hardware background and has no clear understanding of what it takes to develop software. He just thinks that everything is a matter of writing some code to implement and it's done. He doesn't care about making the code more efficient and secure or doing extensive testing to catch edge cases as long as the code works. The VP would also come up with his own deadlines and force it on the software engineers and this caused people to stay late and work on the weekends. 

After finding out about these red flags, I also found out that the engineering department was going to get restructured shortly after I joined and I no longer had to report to the VP of Engineering but to the software engineering manager. The software engineering manager is much more reasonable and is very helpful. Since I have a new manager that I like working with, I thought I'd just ignore all the red flags and work hard.

A couple weeks ago, the VP of Engineering gave me a deadline for a task directly bypassing my manager and the deadline was unreasonable. When I voiced my opinion about the short deadline and what I think would be a good deadline, he responded with ""Really? It's going to take that long?"" and I said I'd shoot for the original deadline but I'm not sure about it (I later found out from the senior engineer that the VP often scheduled things based on how long it takes for the senior engineer to get done which is unfair to the new replacement engineer who's not familiar with the architecture of the software/chip). I talked to my manager about it and he said he had no idea about the deadline as it wasn't communicated with him. My manager talked to the VP and the deadline was extended. I was then asked to work on another urgent task for a different project from my manager and couldn't meet the deadline. On the day of the deadline, the VP sent me a message directly saying I need to have the demo ready for the customer in a couple hours. I got really upset and frustrated as it wasn't anywhere near ready. When I talked to my manager, he said the scheduled demo wasn't communicated with him and he extended the deadline with the VP.

After dealing with the pressure from the VP and my manager checking on me on the status literally every 30mins, I kept getting distracted and couldn't focus on coding making stupid mistakes. It also doesn't help that my cubicle is next to the entrance door and I get distracted every time someone goes in and out. I can't do anything about the location since it's the only available cubicle in the office.

Here's my questions:

1. Is there anything I can do to improve my current situation or is leaving the company the only solution? This is the fastest-paced company I've ever worked for and I feel like I won't be able to keep up with it if it stays this way.
2. Would it look bad on the resume if I decided to quit or get let go within 6 months of employment at a company? Should I just bite the bullet and stay for at least a year if I could?",AskEngineers,drst,/r/AskEngineers/comments/76k3cz/i_started_a_new_job_as_an_embedded_software/

However, I can't help but to see a stigma attached to it when concerning the youth of today and their parents.

In this day in age, I find that more and more kids that are interested in technical work are pushed to go into university for any STEM field while the ""dummies"" are left to go to college and become tradesmen.

Just talking to peers, I find that the overall perception of tradesmen are the electricians that hook up your electricity to your house, plumbers, HVAC guys and mechanics that work at small shops. ""Joe"" jobs.

I find it frustrating that they don't understand that many of these tradesmen are extremely technically competent and can work on amazing projects like plane, ship and mining/manufacturing tooling construction for the top tier companies in the world (boeing, apple, catapiller). Most I have seen get paid more than engineers (some upwards of 200k) and can transfer into management as well.

I have worked before in Germany (I'm Canadian) and have noticed that the tradesmen are much more appreciated there than in north america.

This frustrates me because there is a huge demand for tradesmen while I am starting to see more and more young engineering graduates struggle to get jobs. I feel that the current schooling system puts a huge negative bias towards the trades.

26,Freelance R&amp;D + Prototyping?,1508030611,"To give some background, I'm a fresh graduate from a Tech-Voc school (Electronics) and I'm currently working part-time to save up some money as I'm planning to study again in a few months.

In addition to my current work,  I've been getting small projects as I am being recommended by acquaintances lately.

The nature of the project is usually: They give a vague concept and the circumstances behind it, I try to see what could be done about it. So I think it falls under research, design, &amp; prototyping? Though it is just a side-gig, it seems that more projects are actually coming. (Mostly for automating small processes.)

So what's my concern then? Well, as much as I can enjoy getting things done during my spare time while making some money from it, I can't help but feel that I am getting the short end of the stick as I actually have very little knowledge of how these things are actually supposed to happen. Lack of professional experience and all that.

Like how am I suppose to actually charge them? Am I being compensated adequately for my efforts? Because what I've usually done is just ask them for what is their allocated budget for the project and I just maximize it as much as possible. If they have a big budget? Lucky me. If not, I get to learn something while getting myself some tools and materials.

And if they don't disclose the budget? Well, if a similar device exists already, I just try to compete with the existing price then try to keep to the necessary functions to minimize materials costs and maximize gains. If no device exists, well, I usually just multiply the estimated materials costs by 3 and then add some more depending on how much effort/stress was needed. 

Then there's also the question of contracts, patents, and certifications? Again, as a fresh graduate, I really don't have any ideas about these things. I'm happy enough that I'm able to learn, design and make things, then be subsidized and compensated for it. But searching for other posts about freelance designing, this seems to be a wrong mindset?

As for some details on what I've usually done, well, to start: Given the possible circumstances provided by the client, I just research possible designs and I present it to them. If they find the design plausible and effective (which they seldom question anyway), I make a bill of materials (including the tools needed in most cases), then I ask for an upfront budget based on that.

The 'budget proposal before doing anything' thing was actually something that I've just realized recently. Before that, rather than waiting for the clients to deliberate the costs of the design, I usually bought the materials for myself (using my own money) so that I could just start hacking away and make a tangible proof of concept. (This is probably the reason why they seldom question the design. To see is to believe, no? =D)

Luckily, they have always acquired the prototypes thus reimbursing my costs all the time. But again, I really can't wrap my head around how to charge professional fees and whatnot.  And personally, I already derive some satisfaction from putting things together and seeing how it will work, while being compensated for it.  But again, probably a wrong mindset?

Also note that technically, I'm still not a professional. So there's that. haha

43,Thermal Modeling with Energy2D,1507999122,"Good Morning-

I just discovered Energy2D (Ok, I'm slow) and have been enjoying the simulations.  I'd like to try some 'simple' ones, based upon equipment I have in hand.  I also have a FLIR camera so can watch the heat spread throughout some of the gear...

I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how to set up everything.  Right now I was trying to make a thermal source (power, 5 watts over 1sq inch).  The equipment had a 5mm air gap to an aluminum plate.  There were heat flow through to the sides (ignored), but I then added some silicone TIM to improve dissipation to the case, which then would dissipate to the air.

I also have some copper shims that I could insert between the TIM (make a TIM sandwhich- 0.5mm TIM, 4mm copper shim, 0.5mm TIM).  And watching how that was simulated looked to be interesting... except whatever I'm doing nothing seems to work.

I've stolen from the heatsink demo (fins) with a constant power source, and the fins seem to instantly adjust temperature instead of any finite graduations along their axis.  That might be a setting I'm missing.

Are there any more tutorials out there that you know of that I could delve into?  I'm not really enjoying the constantly looking up Cp and thermal coefficients- I'd really wish Energy2D had the ability to set those for materials (define fin as aluminum 6061), etc.

Background is Chem/Chem Eng, out of school for 20 years, haven't had to do finite element analysis in ... 22 years? :)

48,Assistance welcomed: FEM with multi-fin arrays/finned heatsinks,1507987511,"Hello all,

I've just recently begun my MSc in Mech Eng and am having a little trouble understanding the concepts of how one determines heat transfer in multi-fin arrays. 

For reference my BS was in Mechanical Manufacturing and as such I have no real foundation in thermo to fall back on so I always knew this class was going to test me, but I also knew that trying to cram 3 years worth of undergrad thermo into 12 weeks was a losing battle and that I'd just have to try and pick up what I could as I went along.

With that in mind I was wondering if anyone could be so kind as to help point me in the direction of some simple (and I really mean *simple* as if you were having to explain it to a child) resources that might teach the FEM for heat transfer, especially those  regarding extended surfaces/fins.

54,Question on pneumatically conveying met coke fines into a molten bath,1507950464,"I am working on a project to inject coke fines into the bath of a flash furnace using a lance.

We’re having issues getting the coke transport system to work and are running out of ideas – I’m hoping to get some advice (or for someone to point me to a good place to ask).

We have a hopper filled with 1 t of dry metallurgical coke that has been sized to -1 mm.  The coke is fed from the bottom of the hopper via a screw feeder into a rectangular ‘mixing chamber’.  There is a mechanical seal between the screw and the mixing chamber that is periodically forced open by the movement of the coke through.  There is an air inlet with a conical nozzle below the screw, and an air outlet opposite the screw.  The intent of the mixing chamber is for coke to mix with air and discharge down a hose section, into the lance and then about 300 mm into the melt within the furnace.

We've found is the system works well when discharging through the lance to atmosphere.  As soon as we submerge the lance into the bath, material stops discharging from the screw.

There is a ball valve on top of the mixing chamber we've been using to check if the chamber is under positive or negative pressure.  With the lance discharging to atmosphere, the chamber is under negative pressure/suction and everything works fine. As soon as the lance is submerged into the bath, the chamber becomes positive and the system stops transporting.

Anyone have any ideas on how we can keep the coke transport working while the lance is submerged in the molten bath?

61,[Mechanical] How can I estimate stress concentration from clamping forces?,1507917796,"I'm trying to observe the tensile strength of some polycarbonate samples, but I wasn't able to use the typical dogbone shape for the tensile testing machine. I noticed that the results were much lower than what I expected (based on more rigorous tests that did use a dogbone shape).

I thought that the lower results might be at least partially accounted for by the force of clamping the part in place in the testing machine, but I'm trying to figure out a) by how much and b) why?

My initial theory is that it's because when you clamp the material (ie apply two opposing consistent distributed loads), you're actually slightly deforming the material and creating tiny radii at the ends of the jaws, which would create a stress concentration. If that's the case, then I can't really calculate those effects without further information about the deflection of the material under load.

If there's something else that might prompt that effect that I experienced, then I'd be curious to hear about it.

For a sociological research project on people's real-time interactions, we're interested in using active RFID tags which people will wear. We already have these, using the 2.4GHz band. We're trying to capture both proximity of people to one another at distances from around 1m down -- using the active tags, which we have successfully done before -- and their location, down to a similar distance, which is a novel addition. However, we do not have the budget for additional active tags to place throughout the space we will be using. We are wondering if we can incorporate passive tags too, but it seems these are always on a different bandwidth (i.e. none over 1GHz). Will the active tags pick up information from the passive ones? Does the different bandwidth cause issues? Any feedback would be very useful, as none of us have worked extensively with this tech before.

95,"High compression resistance, but bendable, structure?",1507802908,"Hi,

I am in search of some kind of column-like structure which has a high compression resistance (it should not buckle for loads of 50kg), but is still bendable. The desire for a bendable structure comes from a compactness perspective. 

The goal is to transmit a load between two points, which vary in distance continuously. Both points can be regarded in the 2D plane as revolute joints. The simplest solution would be to connect the two points using a pneumatic cylinder. However I'd like to be able to have a stroke that is larger than the length of the base of the cylinder. 

My idea was to come up with a structure that is able to deal with the varying distance by connecting the structure at one point, and rotate it around a pulley at the other point that does not allow slippage. By locking the pulley, we have a stiff connection between the two points, and if we then rotate the pulley, we can change the distance between the two points. The simplest example of this idea would be the use of a tape measure. The tape spring structure has some stiffness in the compression direction, while still being able to bend (roll up). Furthermore, it should not be able to bend due to lateral forces in between the two points.

My question is: is there actually any structure in existence that has such a property? To my knowledge, bending and buckling strength are very related to each other and I want to minimise one and maximise the other, which sounds very contradicting.

11,"Petro or Pipeline engineers; Would you purchase a home 30' from a 22"" Hazardous Liquid (Petroleum) pipeline?",1507753303,"So. I'm an electrical engineer looking to relocate my growing family. We have two kids now with the third on the way and are looking at one house in particular. The only thing that gives me pause is a hazardous liquid pipeline through the property.

The pipeline is a 22"" branch of the Colonial Pipeline serving a tank farm that is about 2 miles away. This pipeline carries petroleum products including kerosene, gasoline, diesel, and possibly jet fuel. I am unaware of when this particular piece of pipe was installed. 

The line cuts a diagonal across a square 0.5 acre lot and is about 30 feet from the home at the closest point. The point where it crosses the property is a local low point on the pipeline, though the hill which the house is on continues downward perpendicular to the pipeline. The home does have a sub-basement level which is entirely below grade.


1. What are the real risks and considerations? 
2. Should I be concerned about any sort of gas or chemical buildup in the basement? 
3. Should I be concerned about slow leaks that are not detectable by visual inspection or smell, yet enough to cause harm from long term exposure?
4. Are there any reliable detectors that would keep my family safe from whatever risks may be present?

I have faith that a major event would be cleaned up and financial settlements made to make us whole. I'm more concerned about potential occult leakage having long term effects, or the long term effects of a short but heavy one-time exposure. Are my fears valid, or am I being a little too cautious?

16,What type of signal or data does the second wire on an alternator carry?,1507746283,"I understand how alternators work and what the red wire going to the starter/battery is for. And I understand that the second wire leading to the voltage regulator tells the regulator what the alternator output level should be. But what data does this wire carry to/from the regulator in order for the regulator to know when to enable the output voltage? The wire goes between the alternator and the brain box, so it has to be data of some type, either analog or digital.

Specifically I'm looking at a Mahle AAK3359 installed on a John Deere diesel as part of a generator set.

Edit: [Mahle AAK datasheet pdf](http://www.letrika.mahle.com/media/att/13/01/14/Alternators_letrika_web_2.pdf), specifically pages 12-13 of the pdf file, pages 10-11 according to the document numbering. I believe it is wired according to the first schematic labeled as mono-function. From that schematic, ""W"" is not connected, ""B+"" has the red wire going straight to the starter in parallel with the battery. I believe that is the alternator output and is how the pixies get back to the battery when the alternator is outputting. ""B-"" is a chassis ground. ""D+"" is the wire I'm asking about. What kind of information is D+ looking for, analog battery voltage level? Is it output or input? Is ""D+"" the sense signal mentioned in another reply below?

The regulator appears to be internal to the alternator, so by ""brain box"" I meant a controller circuit of some kind. On my car the wire in question goes to where the fuse/relay box is inside the engine compartment. I know there are some control module circuits in there but I haven't investigated that further. On the gen set it went directly to a terminal block on the back of the controller panel. The controller was gutted before I could scope a signal on it to see what it was doing as it ran. I have another gen set I will be scoping next week before it is gutted, but I don't just want to copy what I find. I want to understand what I'm seeing and why.

From other research I've been doing, and seeing that this is a brand new alternator likely containing a logic controlling IC of some kind, I believe that the internal regulator takes D+ as its input and uses it to control a transistor as a PWM signal to the alternator field. The lower the battery voltage, the wider the pulse witdth and the more pixies the alternator releases back to the battery and system. As the battery/system voltage reaches ~14V, it starts to de-excite the field, cutting off the output. It then basically just maintains the optimal ~14V.

I am currently studying MSc Advanced Engineering &amp;amp; Management. I finished my BEng in mechanical engineering and did a few placements in steel industry during summer. 

The reason I made this post is that am currently on the look for a mentor and one of my professors is a great guy that I enjoy spending time with. He is coming from an industrial environment and now doing lecturing which is nice because he has both industrial and academic experience. 

So my question is, how can I persuade him to be my mentor?

That is most human minds at work.




But, computers don't follow their ""feelings."" They follow logic and law. Is there a reason computers should wipe us out? I don't know if doing so will benefit their cause.

I already passed math 1 because I knew everything, I'm having a hard time with math 2 because my teacher sucks, I'm passing all of my exams but failed the first one (got a 0) so I need to get a really high grade in order to pass the subject.

50,Difference in CT and PT,1507664737,"I'm trying to understand the difference between current transformers and potential transformers. I've been scouring the internet for information and I've found a plethora of sites that say the exact same things:

CT - http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transformer/current-transformer.html
PT - http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transformer/transformer-basics.html

I understand the theory and purpose behind a Current Transformer - Current transformers reduce high voltage currents to a much lower value and provide a convenient way of safely monitoring the actual electrical current flowing in an AC transmission line using a standard ammeter.

I understand the theory and purpose behind a Potential/Voltage Transformer - Transformers are capable of either increasing or decreasing the voltage and current levels of their supply, without modifying its frequency, or the amount of electrical power being transferred from one winding to another via the magnetic circuit.

Basically CT - knock of current to a small amount so that it can be measured with a meter
Basically PT - knock down voltages to operate standard equipment. 13.8kv -&gt; 138kV -&gt; 4.16kV -&gt; 120V (i'm simplifying this to a single phase step down transformer)

My question is --  I do not understand MECHANICALLY the difference between these transformers. 

The current transformer in the above website has the bus going through a metal core which is wound with another circuit - the secondary circuit.

The potential transformer in the above website is... the exact same thing??? It has more wound winding of the primary winding around the metal core but.. it's the same thing?

I don't see the difference in how these two devices do two different things but are mechanically the same thing? Help please!

51,KWh confusion...,1507661759,"So I thought I understoon KWh until I read [THIS] (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3)

&gt; In 2015, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,812 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 901 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual electricity consumption at 15,435 kWh per residential customer, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,166 kWh per residential customer.

&amp;nbsp;

I thought saying ""10,812 kWh"" was like saying, **on average**, the system used, or provided, or was capable of providing,10,812 kW of power every hour.

&amp;nbsp;

But, this obviously isn't correct because the number is monstrous, and the quote then provides a lower kWh value ""per month.""  If my thinking were correct, you would just be taking the average used power per month (divided by hours per month) as opposed to the average power used per year (dividing by the hours in a year).  But you would still be taking the value and dividing by hours to get power every hour.  These numbers would end up very close depending on how you did the averages.  Can anyone be kind enough to clear this up for me?

&gt;when wooden and stainless steel rulers are just not good enough, power up to titanium! 

I can't figure out a real reason why you'd want Ti instead of stainless.  Both are non-magnetic and plenty corrosion resistant, two of the advantages advertised if you follow the link in the ad.  And I think stainless is similarly strong and harder than Ti.  So that leaves as the only actual advantage that Ti is lighter.  But for a lot of work, a heavy ruler is a good thing: it stays put with less effort.  Perhaps an ultra-light tool kit would be a nice thing for people who carry tools around all day, but I don't think a stainless rule is a significant part of the weight of any tool kit!

Ti does also have less thermal expansion, but that's not really an issue for the level of precision possible in use of a ruler, and if you really wanted low thermal expansion there are better choices than Ti.

I am helping detail a project for another architect. He wants to see (added to our drawings) accurate shapes of HSS columns and a few other pieces of structural steel. These mostly surround a new steel door and window system being inserted into an old house.

They specify 5x5x1/4. ~~Another common one I need to show accurately is a W10x30 shape~~ [found enough information on this in the subsequent sources listed below].

We don't typically (maybe we mean formerly) need to get too accurate with these as the finishes are mostly worked out based on field conditions but these systems need to connect directly to the steel with no furring or shimming or so forth and these joints will be quite visible.

Any help is appreciated.


**Edit 1**:  I have found some of the dimensions using [this tool](https://www.engineersedge.com/materials/aisc_structural_shapes/aisc_structural_shapes_viewer.htm) but the radius at outside corners is conspicuously not included. That is going to be a critical dimension for us as we need to start our finishes a set distance *behind* that radius.

**Edit 2:**  Ok, I am sure I will be corrected on this so don't bother. I see that HSS and ""structural steel"" are not interchangeable terms as HSS can have thinner wall thicknesses. Also, some rules of thumb might have the outside radius at 2x and not usually more than 3x the wall thickness, [according to this discussion](http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=111222). That is still  vague enough that we need a more accurate dimension if possible.

81,Two ways to calculate pressure at the Bottom of a Barrel [CROSSPOST],1507563484,"I got into an argument with my father-in-law about how to calculate water pressure at the bottom of a full 55-gallon drum filled with water. He stated the ONLY way to calculate the pressure was using the height. While I agree, I offered an alternative that if you knew the weight of the water and the area of the drum's base you could also calculate pressure. He adamantly refused my assertion. I did some math showing both ways were correct, both methods yielded similar results. Can someone check to make sure I'm not missing anything.

The actual argument stemmed from my statement saying you can use a known weight and area to calculate pressure. Since we had ""round"" numbers for everything except the are of the base the math was easy (i.e. 55 gallons * 8 lbs/gallon), divided by area gives PSI. Using P = ρgh would have required ""non-round"" numbers and English unit fuckery (i.e. converting lb-mass to lb-force) in addition to measuring the height of the barrel.
While I agreed he was correct, my father-in-law refused to acknowledge that there was more than one way to calculate pressure. He didn't even want to listen to me when I mentioned the same unit analysis you brought up above. I gave him the hand calculations to show him I was right and he still didn't believe me. I've included a ""Copy"" of those calculations below.


Problem: Calculate pressure at bottom of a ""55-gallon"" drum using two methods. i.e. P = ρgh and P = F/A


Assumptions: gₐ= 9.8 m/s²

ρ(water) = 1000 kg/m³

FROM GOOGLE

Height of Barrel = 0.851m

Diameter of Barrel = 0.572m

Volume of Barrel = 0.2183m³

CALCULATED FROM ABOVE

Area Base = (0.572m)²/4 * π = 0.2570m³


Method 1


P = 1000 kg/m² * 9.8 m/s² * 0.851m

P = 8339.9 Pa


Method 2


P = F/A

F = m*a

m = ρ*V

therefore

P = (ρ*V*a)/A


P = (1000 kg/m³* 0.2183m³ * 9.8 m/s²) / 0.2570m²

P = 8324.9 Pa


A couple of notes. These aren't the same numbers I got when I did it by hand, but I'll assume rounding errors. Secondly, I assume that the amounts vary due to the different methods used and rounding as well since I used ""measured"" data from Google. Sorry I didn't use the plugin for formulas.

82,What happens when good people leave?,1507563432,"What have you noticed about groups when good, key people have left to work elsewhere?  Do they lose business immediately?  Do the other people try to step up and do the work?  Do they succeed?  Or does ineptitude become the new normal, and there is a long slow-decline?  Does management wait around for the next great person to come along and fix everything?

85,Internship vs Full Time after graduation?,1507557706,"So I graduate in May 2018, and so far in my undergrad haven't had any luck obtaining internships so I don't have any professional engineering experience so to speak. I've been going to all of the career fairs and have had several interviews, and I feel like I'm decent at interviewing but my experience is holding me back since I haven't had any second interviews.

From school we've done several interesting engineering projects and I have leadership experience from that. I'm also a FOH lead at a restaurant that I work part time at on weekends, as well as volunteering experience where I've been a committee chair, etc. 

Outside of school and work I play around with mechatronics projects using an Arduino and have had some interested ideas/projects that I've worked on also.

After constantly hearing that they're moving forward with the candidates... I'm wondering if focusing on internship roles after graduating would help get my foot in the door? Or if I should just keep on applying for full time positions? It's disheartening to get rejected but I'm confident I'll get one eventually if I keep trying and doing everything I can to beef up my resume! Just don't know what will give me the best chance.

89,I want to build a cheap gun for Virtual Reality and have it simulate gunfire.,1507551418,"I have an HTC Vive and am teaching myself C# to make games for it. I had an idea for a cheap gun made of pvc that you can hook the controllers to to have it feel like a gun shape. I also thought that you might be able to put some kind of linear actuator or motor with pulleys or something to move a weight quickly to the back of the gun to simulate gunfire. 

My problem is knowing what this thing would be and how much it would cost. Linear actuators are too slow, hydraulics require a pump as far as I know, and I need something fast, electrically powered, and not $1k. 

Any ideas on how I would go about this? I can show pictures of what I was thinking if you want.

90,Piping uneven exit flow,1507547207,"https://imgur.com/a/fdDgc

As a backgroubd, Im a cadet engineer observing utilities in a manufacturing company.  I observed the scenario above, in which more water seems to exit  from the main pipe the closer it is from the dead end (on the right) compared to those nearer the water supply (on the left). This is a problem since it causes uneven distribution over applications such as cooling towers.

I have observed this over four different instances, but are essentialy the same. With no clogging, is there a principle behind this?
