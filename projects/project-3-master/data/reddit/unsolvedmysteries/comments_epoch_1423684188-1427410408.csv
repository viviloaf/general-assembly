0,How do you keep motivated with busy work at work?,1427410265,"My employer is going through a bit of a crunch right now.

The flow of new clients coming in over-all utilization rate of the engineering firm is at an all-time low. Perhaps one-half of the workforce is billing their hours to our company, we do not have any billable projects at the moment.  Upper management is expecting things to be in a depression until min June, when work picks up again.

In the meantime, I have been assigned busy work, cataloging equipment and miscellaneous items we always purchase on projects.  The work is mind-numbingly boring. I despise coming to work to everyday. Prior to this busy work, I was finishing up a fantastic project that kept me busy for 50+ hours per week until the bitter end. Needless to say, my boredom has overcome me at work. I’m on Reddit, news websites, reading about new inventions, checking my sports teams out, etc. Doing everything but the work I was assigned.

I was assigned the busy work about 6 weeks ago. I estimate I’m probably 25% through with it. I have no idea when the deadline is, nobody checks up on me, management isn’t busy so they don’t come to work. I feel like I’m wasting away at work. Lots of people have quit for similar reasons (we’re performance based, no real work for ½ the year = poor salary). 

I’ve been asking everyone if they have projects I can help with. Nobody wants to give up their work.

How do you cope with boredom at work and keep motivated?

14,"Hopefully simple question about wiring a motor and speed controller to an outlet, from a newbie.",1427379557,"Hi all,

I'm new to any type of electrical work, and I'm interested in learning because making gadgets as a hobby is very appealing.  However my normal approach of trying, failing, then figuring out what went wrong seems like a potentially deadly way to enter this space.  So, I have a few questions to ask that will not only avoid any accidents, but hopefully make me more knowledgeable overall.

So, I ordered this cheap motor: http://www.zoro.com/i/G1611267/
and this motor control unit: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QV10548/ref=pe_385040_128020140_TE_3p_dp_1

My goal is simply to get a motor running at controllable speeds (it's all about baby steps :-) )

I thought I ordered compatible parts, but after looking closer I noticed some mistakes I made.  It seems the motor and the controller would work together, but the power supply on the controller wants AC 220V.  I assume my outlet is 110v, which leads to the questions:

1) If I were to plug this into a wall outlet, what would happen?  My guess is that everything would be under powered, but relatively functional.

2) Since I'm new to this, I don't have the terminology down and I'm having trouble finding a power cable that ends with exposed wires to attach to my experiment.  I figured I could just strip an off-the-shelf cable, but I can't imagine this is how professional engineers handle it.  What would you call  power cables with exposed ends?

3) If you look on the back of the motor control unit, there's six wiring spots.  The two on the left side have me confused.  I assume PW means power, and the line between the two represents an open switch.  Does this mean I need some sort of additional switch connected in this spot to make it function, or would this just be wired into an additional shut down switch?

3) For anyone that does this sort of thing, can you point me toward good sources of information for an electrical hobbyist?  My problem with most of the sources I found is while they provide a wealth of facts, they don't really get into what happens in non-ideal situations like the one I'm in.  My trail and error approach to learning doesn't like this; my frail, squishy human frame doesn't like the possible results of doing these things incorrectly  :-)  Also a good source to get materials outside of random Google searching would be appreciated too!

I hope these questions aren't too stupid!  Thanks for any info/advice you can provide!

19,Becoming a Software Engineer with a BS in Electrical Engineering?,1427352850,"I've been doing more searching on this subject in the past few days than you could ever imagine...

Anyhow, here's the gist: I want to know how difficult or common it is for Electrical Engineers to make their way into full Software Engineer positions. I'm talking full development, with or without a hardware aspect. I've done some searching, but I can't really find a good answer. I also am curious as to whether having a masters in CS without a bachelors in CS is actually any good. Like, if I went to grad school for CS instead of EE, would that not make recruiters worry that I might be missing some CS fundamentals?

Here's my situation: I went to school for BSEE knowing that I enjoyed programming (possibly more than hardware design) due to my parents. Now, don't get me wrong -- I learned a lot of cool stuff and really did enjoy a lot of aspects of it. That said, I also got my degree paid for via a ""scholarship for service"" program. So, here I am, almost 3 years after graduation and about to finish my service commitment. I'm pretty close to the LA metro area, so I'm looking for work there and there's a LOT of software jobs.

Unfortunately, my 3 years of experience is in test and although I did jump on as many programming projects as I could at my current job, I'm worried this isn't enough experience to get a job as an actual software engineer. I can't really afford to go back to school right now, but I've been doing research and studying both data structures and algorithms. While I find the topics super interesting and am starting to really grasp the material, I'm worried that's also not enough to get through an interview.

The basic idea is that you have a car battery attached to an electric motor with a switch that can cause the motor to go either clockwise or counter clockwise.

Separate the primary current into resistive and inductive components and hence calculate RM and XM.

61,How to select the most appropriate actuator?,1427201511,"Dear all,

I'm currently doing an internship project this semester which is about the design augmentation of a cadaveric knee simulation system.

Our university is in possession of an Oxford rig. Currently, only quadriceps forces are being simulated dynamically (closed loop control system with a fixed force of the ankle on the ground, under a constant hip load and decreasing knee flexion angles, thus simulating a squat). The hamstrings are being actuated by constant load springs.

It is our task to incorporate dynamic hamstring actuation (open loop). We have to estimate a physiologically accurate force profile and implement the controls that are needed.

My question is now this: How do we choose the best actuator for the job? It goes without saying that we have to thoroughly explain why we choose a certain actuator. I've had all the classic engineering courses but no course on actuators. We cannot possible write a review of all available actuators can we?

What is a good starting point? How do you do this? All information is welcome! Be it just advice, or a guide/tutorial, a pdf of a helpful handbook...

64,Am I getting screwed?,1427169243,"We use a couple of flat head screws on one of our products, and our vendor has changed manufacturers on us, leaving me with a bit of a mess. 

Take a look at this album here: [Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/bd4rv)

You can see that one set of screws has what appears to be a thicker face surface, which causes the screw to not sit flush to the hole. 

The original engineer's drawing for the part seems ok, as the countersink hole depth has been specified as 0.24 +/- 0.1, which should be fine even if the screws are at the maximum end of their tolerance (Solidworks calls out a nominal countersink depth of 0.225). 

The new screws also have a slightly different finish, which is hard to see in the picture, as well as a stamped mark on the head, which, according to one of our other senior engineers, is not supposed to be ANSI spec.

I am unable to find an ANSI spec for flat head, 82 degree, hex screws that I don't have to pay for, and all of our senior engineers don't have their slide rules anymore and rely on Solidworks to help them with nominal specs like this. 

Our vendor claims that the screws are in spec, and I can see that if they are measuring from top of the head to the start of the threads, the screws could both measure within spec. However, they definitely don't sit as flush within the countersink, so my question to you /AskEngineers, is am I getting screwed?

82,What are advantages of a Dutch Master's Degree Vs. an American Master's Degree?,1427134576,"Hi everyone,

So I currently an undergraduate student who is going to graduate from one of the top US public schools in May with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering.  For next year, I am planning on attending graduate school to pursue a Master's in Electrical Engineering (Power).

Most of the schools/programs I applied to and got accepted to are in the US (such as U Michigan, CMU, Georgia Tech); however, I also got accepted to a Dutch school (TU Delft).  I've always loved traveling and foreign countries and am seriously considering living/working abroad for one point and had been considering Delft.  While talking to one of my professors who did his Post-Doc at Delft, he mentioned that they just recently changed their degree system and that previously everyone got a sort of combined bachelors/masters and then would do a PhD, which I hadn't really gotten an impression about before.

I was just wondering if anyone knew if a master's degree from a European/Dutch university is equivalent(ish) to one from an American university.  Will it hurt my chance at employment in the future in comparison to an American masters degree?  How do companies view a European masters in comparison? Should I just stick to a US school?

86,Backup tank for compressed air,1427124810,"Not sure if this is the best sub for this question, but I thought it might be a good place to start.  So the mass spec lab I work in is having a bit of a problem.  The internals of the machine need to stay above a certain pressure, which is provided by the compressed air lines that run through the building.  However, the maintenance people that are doing work in the building keep shutting off the air supply without notice, which causes the pressure to drop too low, and leads to problems that are time consuming to repair.  We thought a solution might be to add a tank of compressed air that only ""turns on"" when the building air supply drops below some pressure threshold, but we haven't figured out how to connect such a system.  What do you think?

Some background:  All of the lines are 1/4 inch lines with swage fittings.  Also, we cannot run an air compressor in the room due to contamination, noise, and power supply concerns.  We tried two check valves connected to a three way fitting, with the tank being set to a lower crack pressure, but it didn't work correctly.",AskEngineers,loooocas,/r/AskEngineers/comments/300qv6/backup_tank_for_compressed_air/

The wire was solid copper, I think it was 20 or 22 gauge. I think there might have been a small knick in the wire from a poor wire stripping. The wire experienced a load of about 2.5 amps for 3 minutes every 30 minutes for 3 months at 12 volts. The system failed at that point. The temperatures remained around -30 C with mild fluctuations. The container it was in was insulated. When I retrieved the system the wire appeared intact, however when I attempted to adjust the wire carefully it just sheared about 5 mm above the connector. The wire had plenty of slack. 

Could the knick have caused the shearing? What else might have caused this? I might take the wires to a professor who can look at the wire under a microscope to guess why it broke, but my time span for finding out what happened is narrow.

1,How are engineering mistakes handled internally at your company?,1427068578,"I've seen and experienced this numerous times. 

A young engineer will make a mistake, the mistake will go unnoticed until already implemented in the field, mistake is noticed by Senior Engineer in the field and corrected with a change order. Young engineer is rolled under the bus in front of the client, in front of peers, and called out. 

For example, I've witnessed a coworker, 1 year out school (as am I) tell a Senior Engineer that safety valve X is located in position Y and needs to be moved to location Z. Senior Engineer tells him he is mistaken and keeps rolling along until the valve is installed improperly in the field. The client observes the incorrect installation, questions us about it, and the young engineer is thrown under the bus in front of the client for being ""inexperienced"". 

I've seen it times and times before with my employer and I'm not sure if this is normal. I understand if management or senior engineering looks incompetent in front of the client, then the client would quickly lose faith in our firm.

&amp;nbsp;

I was looking at a possible career change and was wondering what you think about this, especially you with defense industry XP. **TL;DR @ END**

&amp;nbsp;

**Info about me**: 

* Ohioan, BSEE recent grad of 14' here, No debt, interested in Space / Defense Systems Simulators, Testing Hardware, Drones or Systems work long-term (Think hush hush NASA, SpaceX, Lockmart, Booz, 3 letter agency, Boeing, or other places that do cunning edge things that help the good guys) 
 
* Previous experience: Solid State Lighting, Cyber security, Lab Background work with GPS, Accelerometers and Gyroscopes, made an autonomous robot to navigate a maze. Active ""L"" Clearance for nuke work 

* Never got into any trouble or done anything stupid / regrettable in my life. (for clearance purposes) -- Really wanted to join the military after HS to serve, but instead went to college to become an EE (enjoyed it too!). My family has a lot of Vets in it, we take pride in those who serve. Very ""Murka!"" mentality.

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently a new **Nuclear Engineer** tasked with learning turbine systems and eventually seeing a new Digital control system upgrade. The work here is very regulated and everything is by-the-book. As an engineer, I am not allowed to touch any of the systems physically, so I have to have the maintenance department do all the hands-on work due to union agreements, this kind of bothers me as it is my system and I would like to help too. The work is like a sine wave, some days its a hectic mess, other days it is smooth sailing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**About the current job**

&amp;nbsp;

**Older engineers have recently warned me** that the company uses and abuses engineers at our plant. The engineers even tried to unionize a few years back because of this. *(calling them in during days off, not paying them during forced outages, making you give 5 hours over-time for free, and not paying you overtime rates 1.5x ~ 2x your rates that maintenance and electrical techs (unionized) get paid when coming in for overtime)* Basically, because they are unionized I can easily state that Electrical Techs make more than engineers, have better hours, and are treated better here than the engineers that are incharge of them (and they let you know when they are pulling $90/hour days and your not) Odd to have an older engineer say that he lost a ton of family time and personal time without getting paid in order to keep his job.. I like the job, my co-workers are funny, its cool to put on my hard hat and go out in the field and actually see things working, and the cost of living in the area is pretty decent. I just wish I wasn't working with ancient legacy systems *(cunning edge 70s tech)*, a company that doesn't want to properly fund repairs or fix things the way the engineers suggest, they would rather do cheap and easy, or bury under papers and forget.

&amp;nbsp;

**Nuke Engineer**

&amp;nbsp;

**Pluses**: 

* Steady Work

* 60k Sal

* New DCS system sometime in the future

* Power Company = Job Stability / Security?

* Co-workers are funny and enjoyable

* Boss is from the interwebs, older but gets funny references

* Closeish to city I grew up in / went to college in.

* Cheap cost of living in the area

* Around a rural, lake area, I love paintball, hiking and want to do SCUBA

* Nuclear jokes and stories to tell friends

* Every day is different, from water gushing out of a boiler to filling out paper work to OMG!!! FREE LUNCH TODAY!!!!! :D

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**: 

* Very Regulated by the book work.

* Older engineers warning me about the company.

* Cant touch my systems! :(

* Have to give 5 free hours of overtime

* Never can get OT unless approved

* Techs make more than engineers (Sometimes $1k Days and have better hours)

* Outages - 6 days a week , 12 hour days for usually 2 months, you give them 5 free hours OT, rest is paid normal rate, not OT like the techs / maintenance / ops / electricians,

* Ancient tech, like microfilms, tape reels, DOS, and punch cards.. AND WE KEEP USING THEM =...(

* Toilets are abysmal here - I believe Low flow toilets from the 80s waste more man hours each year than World of Warcraft.

* Friends wont stop talking about Homer Simpson / Radioactive song -_-

&amp;nbsp;

**Experiences Trying to get in the Space / Defense Industry**

&amp;nbsp;

The other opportunities I have been pursuing are in the Defense and Space industry. I recently interviewed with Lockmart about 4 weeks ago and was impressed with the things they described. Unfortunately they have not contacted me back, despite my emails. Before working at the nuke plant I talked / interviewed w/ Boeing, but they called and said they took a candidate who had a TS/SCI poly - clearance over me (probably saves them money).

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Other thoughts on it**

&amp;nbsp;

Now, hear me out, I have been shot-gunning some job apps blindly to some of the big firms and recently have been talking to one that starts with ""Booz"". They said they cant hire on a full-timer who doesn't have a active TS SCI clearance / isn't already clearable, so a recruiter is asking if I would be interested in a summer-fall internship so that I can get a TS SCI. It talks about software development, analysis, some programming with problem solving and application. I can program, but I am by no means a CE or CS. I can do Scripting and Batch files pretty easily, but I am sure a CE/S would cry if they saw my technique.. (My code = if,else,if,else...) But I am interested in the work, depending on what it is and also the TS, because I see that as a stepping stone to get in the industry I am interested in going into. But my thing is that it is an internship.. and well, I just don't know. Aside from joining the military, this maybe one of the better ways to get a clearance and some experience.

&amp;nbsp;

**Booz Internship - Engineering Prototype unknown opportunity**

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**:

* Industry I am interested in!

* Clearance for more opportunities in that industry!

* Title sounds interesting with ""prototype"" in it? = new tech?

* Maybe better hours?

* Better bathrooms?

* Working with the industry that helps defend our country! 

* Develop cool things you wont see publically in years maybe?

* I think its nice for them to offer me this / think about me to get cleared!

* Better pay in the future?

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**:

* Its an internship, after college

* Unknown - But probably going to have to move to an urban area that I cant paintball in or SCUBA in.

* Unknown - Probably less pay at first, until cleared to a real position - Intern

* Unknown - Coding? - Not the best at it, but I can do it! :)

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**: Work at a nuke plant now, its steady work, we are upgrading to a new system some year or another.. But I like the idea of working as an engineer in the Space / Defense industry. - I was Previously rejected for other candidates with active clearances in the Space / Def Industry - In my head its a way of serving and also working with the technology I am interested in. I am in the initial stages of getting offered an internship to get cleared, but I question risking and giving up what I have now to become an intern. Follow a dream of eventually working with Defense / Space? Or is the dream already right in front of me / is a lie / there is no spoon?

&amp;nbsp;

**Long Term goals**:

&amp;nbsp;

Long term I want to first be an engineer who either works with new hush hush tech or Simulators for Defense / Space applications (think plane / helo / war game sims) and/or stuff you'll see in years after it declassifies (think lithium battery), and help bring about new ideas to the table! :) Later I would like to be in charge of a group of new engineers and help them do their tasks / lead some people

16,Engineered triforce joist and BDSM rope suspension... where do I put the load?,1427035681,"So I want to suspend my girlfriend from the ceiling... without killing her. Instead of 2x10 joists, it seems like I have triforce joists (Google ""triforce joist"" and the mfg. website comes up. [Example](http://www.spanotech.be/sites/default/files/imagecache/in_page_gallery_large/images/prod-caract-ajust-img3-eng.jpg)). I looked in some of the documents by the manufacturer, but aside from never loading bottom beam, I have no idea where to tie a rope off at. I have a dropped ceiling, so access to the whole joist is easy.

Dimensions: all 2x4 construction (so  3 3/8 by 1 1/2 true). 11.5"" tall. No vertical posts. I'm not averse to lag bolts or eye screws, though the place is rented. Girlfriend weighs 130 lbs, safety factor of ~~1.5 puts that at about 200~~ 500 lbs total.

Realized that the stupid truss is glued to the subfloor, so shoving a rope over the top chord isn't going to be feasible. 

I decided to tie a rope off at an apex. The apex was well-made, with a precise cut to match the top chord another cut to match each web, so I'm assuming it'll handle some body weight no problem, especially if I wrap rope near the top to minimize bending forces on the truss webs. My knot might not be the most appropriate (square knot, breaks at 45% line strength, or 5.76 kN), but it was easy to do and it's only taking 1/4 of the total load (its share is 1.58kN, if there's a 4.45kN shock load on a 90 degree rope angle). Another ""faux pas"" is the sharp-ish angle of the ropes. I'm estimating a 90 degree angle at the carabiner, so I can assume that each ""side"" of rope is taking 71% of the total load (maybe 3.16kN if it's shock loaded to 4.45kN, over 4 lengths of rope!). I'm a little concerned with the corners of that truss connector plate digging into the ropes, so I might throw up a few nails to ""guide"" the ropes away a bit. 

The yellow rope is rated for 12.8 kN, while the green straps are rated for 27kN each. Top 'biner is rated for 26 kN vertical, while the bottom is rated for 25 kN vertical (they're both loaded just a little bit horizontally but I don't think that's a big deal since the angles are small). Girlfriend is 0.58 kN; I think what I have created is overkill.

19,Converting position to variable spring rate?,1427012428,"Software engineer with very little mechanical engineering background here, seeking for help/pointers.

I'm looking for a mechanism that can transform linear (or rotational) motion into ""springiness"". The input is a displacement along a linear (or circular) path. The output should allow tensile forces to be applied to a spring, with the spring rate being a function of the input displacement (ideally, but not necessarily, linear). At one end of the input range, the output should be completely free to move, at the other end, it should be fully blocked. In-between, variable spring rates should apply. I hope this explains is sufficiently, without being confusing?

I've been thinking of a linear tension spring that gets ""intercepted"" at various points along its length, or maybe some kind of torsion (main?) spring (like the type used in a measuring tape), along with some kind of clutch... But I'm pretty sure something like this must exist already, Google didn't help though, since I'm probably just not familiar with the correct terminology.

Therefore, I would be thankful if someone can point me in the right direction. Are you aware of any such mechanism, or have an idea how it could be designed?

I had previously thought that I would go into software engineering after graduation, but recently discovered that I just don't enjoy it much anymore and much prefer the hardware side of things. My interests now lie mainly in digital design and verification, but I'm becoming increasingly interested in other aspects of EE as well (namely more interest in analog stuff than I used to have).


I can switch to be EE by swapping a couple of classes in my last two semesters. This does require me to not take a class I really want to (VLSI design) due to time conflicts. Essentially it amounts to a two class difference. I.E. if I graduated without changing anything only two classes would be different.


My question is this: does having a degree in CmpE rather than EE prevent me from getting jobs in things like digital design and *potentially* analog design at least from an electronics perspective? I really don't have interest in RF or large power systems, so that's not a concern. And for the sake of argument, let's assume that I have all the same knowledge as if I switched to EE, and that my resume would be the same either way except with a different degree.

I got hired by a small to mid-size construction firm (150+ people, Div 9 sub mostly) a couple of years ago to work in their Estimating department. (I have some other engineering experience too.)

I have worked my way up to being the senior employee in the department. There is only the Estimating Department Manager (actually more like Preconstruction, what with purchasing and all) above me, with the company President above him.

They have given me plenty of direction with job duties (all sorts of estimating and preconstruction actions with just a hint of field work), but they have not given me a job title. Almost no one in the company has a real title other than the lead Project Managers. I think this is due to a laziness on the part of senior management to ever create an org chart.

33,Using a 220V device on 110V outlet -&gt; current?,1426954592,"Hi all,

A quick question just to see if my reasoning makes sense.

I have a 220 V washing machine which I want to plug in to a 110 V outlet. The line filter on the machine says 110/220 V 50/60 Hz so that shouldn't be a problem. I want to know what will happen to the current requirements though.

So my train of thought is that the engine requires a certain EMF, so a certain current. The machine's power rating is 2000-2300 W, so let's say this is 10 A at 220 V. After switching from 220 V to 110 V, the machine will still need this 10 A current internally to rotate the drum, correct? So the line filter will need to switch transformers so that the current stays the same. At half the output voltage, this means it would need to draw twice the current, correct?

If the machine currently draws 10 A, it means it would draw 20 A at 110V?
The line filter is rated at 10 A (http://www.ebay.es/itm/Siemens-A-14-26-Kondensator-F-11-126-876-322-70-4417-/161468103676), I would thus need a filter with twice that rating? If that's unavailable, what can I do without getting a transformer, and do I need to take special care of the inductance rating?

For the past week, i have been constantly reading forums, websites and asking questions to random people on the internet about whether i am good enough. I even posted a similar question here before, and some on alternate accounts in hopes to not look like a crazy person. Today has been a particularly stressful and depressing day as the deadline for me to chose my courses is just around the corner.   
  
I don't know if mechanical engineering is right for me. I initially chose ME because i liked math,physics, and learning about how things work, but i have come to learn that there is very little math and physics in an actual ME job, and its mostly 3D modelling on solidworks and AutoCAD. Unfortunately for me, i suck at spatial reasoning. I asked a question on here about this particular issue but got mixed answers. Today in my engineering graphics class we learned about development drawings in which we take a 3D object and fold it out into a 2D scheme. One of the exercise questions we did was to find the 3D object given the folded out view. Most people in my class got the answer immediately, while i was sitting there like an idiot trying to work it out. It took me more than 5 minutes to finally get it.  
  
I want to eventually work with thermo/fluids, so things like pipes, heat exchangers, pumps, coolers, things like that. By 'work with', i mean i want to be able to do calculations involving pressure, fluid flow, stress, etc without much design. Should i continue with mechanical engineering?

42,How do I decide Masters vs PhD route and what specific field of engineering (ME vs MSE)?,1426886996,"Alright, I realize the question is vague, so let me fill you in on the details. 

I am currently a sophomore studying MSE at a top 20 engineering school with a 4.0 GPA. I am currently involved in research and enjoy my work. I plan on going to grad school, and I am leaning towards a getting a Masters degree. Moving forward (5-10 years down the road), I would like to develop a research topic into a business and explore that side of things. The two things I would like to decide are as follows:

* Masters vs PhD
* Switch to Mechanical or stick with Materials Science

I work on a multidisciplinary research team, and one of my peers is getting his Bachelors in Mech E. We speak on a regular basis and teach each other what we are learning in our classes. I find Mech E also very interesting and feel like it is useful to know. I am also pursuing a minor in Art and Design and would love to be able to get into mechanical design. I can either stick with Materials Science (which I really enjoy) and learn Mech E on the side, or broaden my education and dive into Mech E for grad school. I have talked to quite a few people on the matter, and here are some of the things I have gathered. 

* MSE students generally get either a Bachelors or PhD because that's where a lot of the work is, there is not much work for MSE at the Masters level. 
* Masters vs PhD depends on what you want to do. Masters is a more practical route for engineers, you would be working with clients to solve problems. You will mostly likely be using knowledge that is known to solve problems. PhD is the route to go if you want to lead a research team or stay in research. PhDs work in areas that are currently unknown, and they discover knew knowledge. (this is coming from a Mech E professor, however)
* PhDs are generally easier to get funding. (and I am not trying to pay for grad school)

This said, do you have any advice? What is the value of a Masters degree in MSE? Do I need a PhD if I would like to eventually create a tech-startup and be more involved with the business side of engineering?

Thanks for your time.

I'm trying to produce a large part (24x24x3"") with a pretty thick (1-2"") wall section, annual quantity in the 10,000's. It needs to be a durable material, one that can withstand a lot of foot traffic wear. If it wasn't for the thickness I'd probably go straight to injection-molded TPE in the ShoreA 40-60 range, but I'm not sure if there is a more economical process that I should be looking at.  Other processes I've considered are cast urethane/foam and RIM.

I have a question concerning a chiller for an auditorium.  I haven't done much with chillers and so I appreciate any help on this matter. The air side is calculated for 10,000 CFM or 25 tons but the water side is calculated at 39 tons, a 14 ton difference.  Using a 25 ton chiller will use 64% of the rated capacity of the coil, just over half of its capacity.  Some suggested that they would like to size the chiller using only the air side of the calculated tonnage, but I feel this will not run well enough to dehumidify and also affect the delta across the coil, is that correct?

Is it even something you can talk about in job interviews?,1426869429,"Say you're a young engineer working at a small company with a lot of problems. You've solved many problems, but you're seemingly always the smartest person in the room and it's apparent that no one else at the company is putting in any effort or really cares. Your management is complacent even when major issues surface, and so you're doing a bunch of other peoples' jobs, and things can be very stressful. Because you want to succeed, and the only way to make that happen is to take on a lot of work and to work very hard. And you're okay with that, but you'd love to have some help, or see that other people care. And while it can feel very rewarding when you manage to pull through and solve a big problem with very little support or leadership, you know that this place is not somewhere to stay long-term.

Is there a silver lining to working in an environment like this?

- He would usually cover three structures per episode that were somewhat related (I think)
- He went to to couple of dingey looking 70s era precast tower apartment blocks in London that were connected by a footbridge and explained how the engineer allowed for different relative movement of the towers by allowing movement at one of the bridges supports
- He may have also gone to a French earth fort and explained retaining walls and one of the first engineers to describe their behaviour for use in his designs
- He went to La Villette in France to talk about Peter RIce's floating glass boxes
- He may have also talked about the Pompidou Centre
- He went to a footbridge somewhere to talk about reinforced concrete and how it arose when we first began to understand the internal stresses in beams/columns etc.

I'm a senior civil engineering major focusing in structural design.  My goal with this degree was to design the typical buildings and bridges, what I'd describe as ""traditional"" structural engineering.

However, I've recently been offered a position with a company that focuses solely in steel retrofitting and modifications.  As described to me, they act as a sort of specialist that adds to or changes existing steel structures.  I imagine it would be very similar to all of the things I did in my Steel Design course - modes of failure, weld design, etc.

I'm considering their offer because I feel it'd be a good starting structural position:  it would give me the experience I need to take the PE exam and it's in a great location for me to finish my Masters degree at my current school.

My main concern is how the experience will be viewed after my time at that position - when I start looking for more traditional structural positions.  Do you think it would hinder me when I am applying for the more traditional buildings &amp;amp; bridges design positions?  Do you think I'd start over as an Engineer I at the more traditional places because of lack of experience with wood &amp;amp; concrete design?

64,A question about heat exchange.,1426797593,"I am trying to save about 250,000 gallons of water from being dumped down the drain at my work yearly. Currently the water is being used to flow through the water jacket of some distillers that are on all day long.

I estimated about 120 gallons per hour flow through the water jackets. And the water flowing through is being raised by 5 degrees Celsius as it passes through.

My math is as follows:

120 gallons * 3.7 = 444 Kg/hr 

Since 1Kcal=1 Kg of water being raised by 1 degree C, I got.

444*5=2200 Kcal/hr 
and since 1Kcal=1.16 watts, 

2200*1.16 = 2575.2 Watt hrs.

I have available to me a chiller that is listed as being able to remove 900 watts.

It seems to me that running the water through the chiller on a closed loop would raise the water temperature too high, and cause it to boil fairly quickly. I've run this by co-workers and they recommended ethylene glycol instead of water.

My questions are......

Am I wrong on my math? I never took an engineering class in my life, I'm just getting these numbers from the internet. Is it possible 900 watts will be enough removal for the job?

Will Ethylene Glycol make a difference? In my mind I imagine it not mattering what material the heat is flowing into is made of, 2575 watts vs 900 watts just won't work. Am I wrong? 

Also. If neither option will work. Does anyone have any suggestions about what would work?

The beam is 24"" long and 1 inch thick, some width. Your goal is to reduce the deflection on the end of the cantilever. The only thing you have on hand is a small block 6"" long, and 1"" thick, some width. Say you were to fasten this smaller beam underneath the larger beam.

I mean, from my layman's view weather prediction models are based heavily on movement of air, also known as wind, storm sometimes, aren't they? So, in my naive view it makes perfect sense to additionally use their sensors to further improve parameters of weather prediction, doesn't it?

I am good with computers.  I am good with most pieces of machinery.  Most things I own seem to perform, in working condition, most of the time.

But printing documents is invariably this horrible experience.  Printer ignores my computer and does nothing (maybe 40% of the time), or jams halfway through, or grinds and wheezes for 20 min before spitting out a doc.  

Then on occasion a printer gets serviced, and we get instructions like:

""Go into your settings, add the device, remove the device, then restart your computer 2x waiting 5 min between restarts, then spin around 3x and clap your hands and chat an invocation.""

So much technology these days seems to function so seamlessly...including computer peripherals.  My mouse, keyboard, external cd-rw, USB devices, speakers, microphone...all work great.

Hey Reddit!!

We're a branch of [EWB-UK](http://www.ewb-uk.org/) and we've been developing a pedal-powered water pump to be used for off-grid irrigation in developing countries. Specifically our partnership is with a community project in the east African country, Malawi. Most farmers in this area barely grow enough food for their own needs. Our pump would give them the opportunity to reduce their reliance on foreign aid and increase their sustainability during the tough dry season when food shortages are a major problem.

Up to now we have modified a standard (50-200)W centrifugal water pump to be pedal powered...the great bit of this design is that it uses broken pumps that would otherwise be scrapped.

[Heres some pics of what we've done so far](http://imgur.com/a/6CmR3/all)

The problem we're facing at the moment is finding a source of these broken water pumps, as close to Malawi as possible. We want to start approaching manufacturers, sellers, scrappers of these pumps. Before that we want to ask Reddit if they have any suggestions on who we can approach and routes to the right people in the hope of finding a solution.

Any nuggets of knowledge you have regarding this project/problem would gratley appriciated and any questions you have we would love to answer :) !!! please see below for additional information regarding the project 

[Design and instructions](http://imgur.com/ONohZi8)

For anyone who likes the idea we would appreciate some help redesigning the frame. The attachment points (things that hold the back wheel in place) are really hard to manufacture cheaply and easily. We've been trying to redesign them for ages but are struggling. Any suggestions would be great! They need to hold the weight of the bike and the rider and should be able to fit as many bikes as possible without modifying the bike. :)

The Voltage Transfer function from Vs to Vd is:

    Vs/Vd = Rc / Sqrt( (Rc+Rs)^2 + C^2 * Rc^2 * Rs^2 * ω^2)

The phase shift between Vs and Vd

     Phase(Vs/Vd) = arctan( -(C * Rc * Rs * ω) / (Rc + Rs) )

Now, for small values of Θ, tan(Θ) = Θ, so, so long as I'm only interested in cases where the phase shift is small..

    Phase(Vs/Vd) ≈  -(C * Rc * Rs * ω) / (Rc + Rs)

Now, here is where I get confused. If I divide both sides by Omega:

        Phase(Vs/Vd) / ω ≈  -(C * Rc * Rs ) / (Rc + Rs)

Now, normally, Angle/Angular frequency = time for that angle to occur. So that that mean that that equation is saying ""So long as you're only talking about small phase shift, the time for a Voltage to spread from the point Vs to the point Vd is -(C * Rc * Rs ) / (Rc + Rs) ?

I note (as RC=τ) that that Equation basically has the form of τ * (R/R), which is quite interesting (especially as Rs/(Rc+Rs) is the DC voltage transfer). But I don't really know what that means either.

The other is one of the biggest companies in the world. They want to give me considerably more money to do industrial engineering work (they have interns for timing, more along the lines of lean and process improvement). I worked there last year as an intern, I made prototypes which was pretty enjoyable but not really engineering work. Lots of security BS and bureaucracy.

IDK what to do. Everyone I know says don't go (to option a) but, it's an hour away - it's not like I'm moving across the country. The best defense anyone came up with aside from not hanging out all the time is the fact that small towns are dull and I'm not that knowledgeable about weldements and farm tools (which the guys at option a are aware of).

Please help. I could really use some advice.",AskEngineers,SheppyTheVolus,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2zegt4/big_company_or_small_company/

They all twisted, and they all twisted in the same direction so when assembled the bench is twisted enough that one leg is 2"" in the air. I need to resist about 450 ft*lb over a 72"" span that is 15.5"" deep and probably about 4"" max height. the 72"" is the distance between the legs., 15.5"" is the distance allowed front to back under the seat.

I could attempt screwing a 2x6 under the bench in the convex direction to pull the bench straight, maybe use a pre-loaded 2x6 (one that already has some bend in it)

Or I can weld up a structure out of metal to support the underside of the bench seats that is torsionally stiff. The most weight-friendly way I can imagine doing this is with a shallow and wide inverted triangle welded out of angle iron or something similar. good examples here: http://www.tonyfoale.com/Articles/Frame.mod/KawaMods.htm I have access to a welder and supplies so the metal route isn't a problem, just not as easy as an additional 2x6.

My problem concerns the compatibility between Plaxis 8.2 (an older version from 2002 I think) and the modern compilers. I’m currently using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 with a Lahey-Fortran shell and also Silverfrost FTN95. So far I’ve been able to compile all the fortran files into a .dll, Plaxis recognizes it in the Materials menu, but when I try to run a simple example provided by the program using my soil model, I get the message ‘An error occurred while running the calculation program’ , in the calculation menu. I double checked the code and I believe it to be correct. (Seriously my eyes are starting to bleed).
I also downloaded the sample subroutines in fortran and .dll’s that are provided in the plaxis website. The .dll works fine but I can’t compile the subroutines without changing the code because they were made for a different and older compiler.
Also the Plaxis 8.2 Manual only refers to compilers that are no longer in the market.

I’m wondering if someone knows any modern compilers that have good compatibility with this old version. 

Otherwise I'll quit this and try Abaqus instead.

38,What reasons are there for the lack of natural gas/combustion engine powered AC units?,1426554220,"I wand to point out that I don't have any form of mechanical degree or schooling outside basic high school physics.

So A few weeks ago I went through a rather extensive research on my own. I don't know where I wrote it all down so I can't provide all of it here however I am re-doing some of the math below. Perhaps I am wrong somewhere? Double checking the math/gas usage/cost calculations and comparing to some known numbers for other gas using objects it seems correct.

&amp;nbsp;

The main issue I can understand is the need to perform oil changes on the engine and higher wear and tear compared to an electric motor which might run for years without being touched. Even then the cost per month is still an order of a magnitude lower than an electric AC unit($70 electric bill in the winter vs upwards of $300 in the summer)

&amp;nbsp;

I did a lot of research into it to see if it was even possible from a technical standpoint such as using a car's AC unit. I remember finding that a typical car AC system has about 40,000-100,000 BTU at 4000 rpm and would need 5-8hp at that speed(This was all originally thought out and calculated using in*lb and not hp, I just remember the hosepower figures)
 Since we don't want to run the engine at 4000 but instead closer to 1000-2000 we want a 30hp engine. You can easily get this with a 250cc engine such as from a dirt bike.

&amp;nbsp;

So with this we have 1000 rpm and 250cc displacement so we can calculate theoretical air flow. Assuming no Turbo we can guess an efficiency of 0.8 (Addition of one may make it more efficient and allow smaller misplacement but I never looked into that.)

&amp;nbsp;

(1000 / 2) * 250cc * 0.8 = 100000 cc per minute or 0.1 kiloliter per minute.

Last month my gas usage was 43 CCF@ $25.58(the extra ""Fees"" and ""Charges"" removed) which puts the cost at $0.59488 per CCF or 2831.68466 liters. if we convert the $ perLiters to a sane number we get $0.2100812 per kiloliter.

&amp;nbsp;

With an air to fuel ration of 17.2:1 (5.8%) we will calculate the amount of air and fuel used per hour.

0.1 kiloliter * 60 minutes = 6 kiloliters per hour.

6 kiloliter * 0.058 = 0.348 kiloliters of fuel used per hour.

&amp;nbsp;

0.348 kiloliters * $0.2100812= $0.0731 per hour to run the AC. Assuming 5 hours a day run time over 30 days:

$0.0731 * 5 hours * 30 days = $10.96500 per month to run or $132 per year.


This comes out to about the same gas usage as a 15000 BTU oven. If we punch in 5 hours/day below we get $122 yearly cost. http://www.michigangasutilities.com/home/gas_calculator.aspx",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2zasju/what_reasons_are_there_for_the_lack_of_natural/

Two parts are coming in contact on purpose in a sliding motion, the first being the 304 stainless steel which is moving pulled along by a chain, the second is Black Acetal/Delrin that is static.

The problem:

The Acetal/Delrin is wearing away the 304 Stainless in such a fashion that a retaining ring nearby is coming lose causing parts to shift to where they now jam the system. The stainless has worn thin by .17 of an inch in 3 months 24/7 use. While the static acetal/Delrin part is has not noticeably worn down.

45,Traffic Engineering - Average Time Waiting in Queue - Problem,1426528133,"I'm working on a design problem to determine the number of access points we need at a receiving station for FOG at a wastewater treatment plant such that drivers don't wait more than 20 minutes for access.  I'm trying to use my queuing formulas from traffic engineering to calculate average wait time, but I'm hitting a problem.

From my data and calculations:

* average arrival time, λ = 0.083 veh/min
* average departure time, μ = 21.25 min/veh
* traffic intensity, ρ, λ/μ = 1.764

If my traffic intensity, ρ, is greater than 1, I can't use MD1 queuing equations.  So, I tried to use MMN queuing equations, assuming 1 access point

* utilization factor = ρ/N = 1.764

If the utilization factor is not less than 1, I can't use MMN queuing equations.  Luckily, I tried 3 access points and I got the wait time I needed to meet.

However, what should I have done if I had only needed 1 access point?  None of the equations I have available work for that situation with such a large average departure time.

50,The Great 2D Crane COMPETITION!,1426520898,"So me and some fellow students are enlisted in a Crane competition, we are all studying to become engineers, but business engineers so the engineering part is alot harder for us than most other engineers! Therefore, my question is:

With these techical specifications how would you build the best possible cran?

General info: 
Our own ideas, and a picture that illustrates length and height of the crane
http://imgur.com/a/xUeuW 

1. The design must be mounted on a bracket with two holes in the points A and B, are to be regarded as pin connection. The bracket you get handed the workshop.

2. The construction is loaded in point C with a vertical force P. The point C is located. See the figure on top. All targets are given in the figure in mm.

3. The truss structure must be made from lists of lights 2700 x 13 x 3. It shall consist of simple rods with two holes in. Their diameter is 3 mm. The distance from the rod end to the hole's center is 10 mm. The bar length determines yourselves.

4. The final design must be made from strips of wood with a total length of no more than 5 m.

5. The rods must be connected to each other by means of bolts, washers and nuts M3. The connection must not be too tight. Lim, pieces of wood and other stiffeners in the nodes must not be used.

6. For the final design shall together with the bolts used some threaded rods with length of 100 mm. The whole structure must be centered relative to their middle point. These threaded rods to prevent the structure warping during the test, where the structure is placed between two plates in the distance about 110 mm. There must be a cap nut on all threaded rods.

Finally here is how strong the sticks for the construction is:

I am studying in a British university therefore, we use the Kern method when finding the heat transfer coefficient, pressure drops, etc. I want to discuss why the two methods have different values when calculating those. According to this journal: http://esatjournals.org/Volumes/IJRET/2014V03/I15/IJRET20140315093.pdf

""...heat transfer given by Bell Delaware method is much more than the [Kern Method]. Also the shell side pressure increase rapidly with increasing flow rate and this increase is again more in Bell Delaware method as compared to [Kern].""

Furthermore:
"" Kern method does not take in to consideration the obstructions due to baffles in calculating the pressure drops and hence the pressure drop given by Kern method is unrealistic. Whereas, the pressure drops given by Bell and Bell Delaware methods, is more realistic, since these methods consider pressure drop due to bypass and leakage streams caused by the baffles in the heat exchanger.""

If this is the case based on the calculations, then Bell-Delaware method seems more accurate and more 'realistic'.

Anyway, for some time, it's seemed to me that having a large number of thin spokes doesn't make much sense.

If you doubled the radius of each spoke, but had 1/4th as many spokes, you'd end up with a stronger, stiffer wheel. That's without getting into potential efficiencies of spoke cross-sections with greater structural efficiency than a circle, like hollow tubes.

Am I misapplying some engineering concepts here, or missing something important? Perhaps missing something crucial in the design of bicycles that makes numerous spokes necessary?

I know the total energy (in kJ) needed to cool the tank to temp, as well as the cooling water inlet and outlet temps. Is the amount of water needed simply = (kJ of heat needed to cool vessel) / (Cp water*dT water)? The main thing I'm confused on is the fact that the outlet temp changes over time so should I use an arithmetic average dT or a log mean dT, something else, or does it not really make much of a difference?

The only liquid flowing is that of the cooling water which is simply through coils on the outside of a jacketed vessel, so I guess it isn't really considered co/counter-current flow since the liquid in the vessel is stationary. The liquid in the vessel is assumed to have the same properties as water.

*   The temps for the vessel are initially 95 C which is then cooled to 45 C

*   Total cooling time is 3 hours and assuming a constant cooling flow rate.

*   The cooling water inlet temp is 9C, and like I said the exit temp changes over time from 75 C to 25 C over the same time frame.

I'm assuming the problem looks something like this (m x Cp x dT)vessel liquid = (m_dot x 3hrs x Cp x dT)cooling water, and then solving for m_dot x 3hrs

but again I don't know if I'm over simplifying things or if a simple answer is what is warranted. Again the dT for cooling water isn't constant throughout the cooling time though.

Not entirely sure if this is the right place for this question, but lets see how we go...

****

tl;dr version: 

Do inline timers exist that allow power through for a set period of time, and then open circuit? Like the opposite of this ""delay on"" timer (http://www.omega.com/pptst/TD-69.html), I want it to allow power through for a period of time and then break the circuit (which isn't the same as a ""delay off"" timer). 

****

Story version:

I have a really basic timer -&gt; microswitch -&gt; motor circuit to open and close a chook pen door. It's just a 24h timer with C+NO+NC, with the C+NO wired to the motors CCW direction via a microswitch at the top of the door, and C+NC wired to the motors CW direction via a microswitch at the bottom of the door. Super simple.

The trouble is that if the door gets jammed on anything on the way down, it never triggers the bottom microswitch which means the motor keeps turning until it's unravelled the rope used to lift the door and then starts winding it back up again, causing the door to raise instead of lower. Eventually it reaches the top of the frame and stalls which is not good for the motor, the wiring or the poor old chooks who face a night with an open door and foxes around.

All I want is to add something between the time clock and the motor to only allow it to run for a maximum period of time. The door takes ~55 seconds to close so I figure a 1 minute maximum operating time would be perfect.

Anyone know of such a beast, or at least the proper name for this type of device so I can search a bit more efficiently?

###An experiment with AutoModerator settings

Some of you may have noticed that AutoModerator has been making automated responses in some threads. I'm experimenting with something that /r/engineering has implemented, where AutoModerator will send users that submit new threads a PM reminding them to assign a link flair to their post, or it will get removed after X minutes.

What's being done here is a bit different. Nothing will be automatically removed, but any post with 250 characters or less will trigger the auto-response. I figured that if OP can't bother to include at least 2 tweets worth of writing in his/her post, then it might be good to have the auto-response trigger for a couple of reasons:

1. The user is probably new and unaware of the rules, and

2. even if a user is aware of the rules, they probably did not include enough information.

As with anything automatic, it won't work 100% of the time. For example, [**the coffee thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2z0qi1/engineers_of_reddit_how_much_coffee_do_you_drink/) is perfectly fine, but it [triggered the auto-response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2z0qi1/engineers_of_reddit_how_much_coffee_do_you_drink/cpengk5) because the original post was only 173 characters (and subsequently got downvoted to hell because... well it's pretty annoying!)

I'll be tweaking it a bit more as time goes on, but **from this point forward, any post with less than 150 characters will trigger the auto-response.** If it ends up completely flopping, either by not addressing the two concerns above, or by being too annoying, then the setting will be removed.

##**Your feedback is really important here, so if you have any concerns about this, please speak up.**

What do you think? Is it a good or bad idea? Is it even necessary to have it?

* Due to popular demand, ""Sci-Fi Friday"" will be renamed to ""Sci-Friday"".

* A new ""Panel of Engineers"" thread will be coming in the next couple of weeks. Don't worry if you applied in the one in the sidebar; I'll get around to your application this weekend before I post the new one.

* A new ""Call for engineers willing to be interviewed"" thread will also be coming soon to replace the current one which is now nearly two years old.

92,Automotive engineering questions,1426312067,"Hello,

I'm trying to figure out a lot about potential careers and what I really want to do in life and I couldn't think of a better place to ask than here. So basically, I am currently a sophomore at university and I originally pursued a biology degree with the intentions of going to medical school. Although I've been able to maintain good grades, I've hit a point where I'm feeling like this is not my passion and that this is not a field I would enjoy working in for the rest of my life. Another thing about me is I absolutely love cars, I've been a fan of them since I turned 16, and I stay up to date on the newest advances in technology and the latest and greatest cars. I would say that cars are something I really get excited about and am passionate about. The reason I'm looking into auto engineering is because I really would like to take part in designing cars and something along those lines. I'm also pretty great at math and solving problems and I like knowing how things work. So I have a few questions if anyone could help me out and give me a better understanding of this field I would really appreciate it.

1. How competitive is the auto industry in terms of engineering vs. other industries you could potentially be in?

2. How would one get in and get a foot in the door in this industry? 

3. What qualities are best for being successful at this?

4. How does one get into the performance side of the auto industry? (Designing like super cars, sport cars, not like f1 racing or anything like that)

5. What does a typical work week look like? 

6. Would you recommend just doing mechanical engineering and pursuing other parts for sake of stability and better opportunities? 

7. My school has an option for a major in engineering with either a focus in automotive systems, electrical, or mechanical. What are the benefits to each and what seems to be the best gig?

If you have any more insight you could share with me about engineering or anything in general I would appreciate it. Any advice, tips, encouragement would help.

I'm really interested in venturing into oil and gas and preferably land a job in upstream (drill engineer or reservoir engineer). However since I like to keep my options open, I wouldn't mind landing a job as facilities engineer, pipe line engineer, process control engineer, production engineer or simply mechanical engineer. So I've just landed a job at a small petroleum company whose main service is providing supply chain. The office isn't big and the number of staff working there is less than 30 if I'm not mistaken.

My question is this, if I were to accept this job and work on renewable energy (solar), will it be possible to apply for an upstream/offshore job later in my career? Since from what I gather, they're two different things from a technical point of view. I've spoken to my dad (senior geophysicist in oil and gas) about this and he said since I'm a fresh grad, its important to get that experience first before applying for a bigger oil and gas company and that there's no age preference when applying for upstream/offshore work.

After blowing through the tunnel, the hot air travels through a drying cabinet with screened trays holding the products to be dried.  Since I'll have forced air, rather than relying just on convection currents for air movement, I have the option of locating the hot-air input for my tower of drying racks either above or below the drying racks.  I'm not sure which of these options is best.

As a non-engineer, I see the benefit of the hot air input from below being that ""hot air rises,"" and perhaps that means the hottest/most humid air escapes first, taking the moisture with it.  On the other hand, if I have the air input above the screens, it will be the coldest, rather than the warmest, air that will be forced out of the vent, maximizing my available heat.

Which version, if any, should be more efficient in removing moisture?  Does hot + humid air have a different density than hot + dry air, and how does this affect the likely movement of air and moisture throughout the cabinet?

Tonight, still on the trip, I had dinner with the VP Finance (a cofounder) who suggested that I should consider whether I want to ask for a raise or more equity.

Based on some salary websites, I had been thinking to ask for a $20k bump to $135k. If I were to ask for more stock options in lieu of the salary bump, how should I value those?

Should I ask for $20k in equity at its current valuation? Or the salary increase? If the equity is a one-time thing, it could set back my salary growth in coming years.

They needed a licensed engineer, I wanted a new start, so it was a perfect fit.  I'm for the most part happy here, although sometimes the work is stressful, especially when being compared ""utilization-wise"" to people that don't have a wife or family, thus having a greater willingness to work longer hours (although, this is still something I do when a project needs to get out the door.)  All of that being said, I enjoy working here. 
 
About a week ago I was contacted by a recruiter for a city, asking me to apply and interview for a plans examiner job.  I did, not because I'm looking to move but because I'm always interested in hearing what else is out there, brushing up on my interview skills, etc.  I interviewed with this in mind, but while the interview went well, I walked away thinking I wouldn't get an offer and I would just go back to my job I liked most days.

25,New Mechanical Engineering Student here: Should I quit?,1426200805,"Hey guys,

You probably get flooded with this question, but I have to get it off my chest.  
First a little backstory. In High School (Germany) I always wanted to study Physics but after educating myself about it, I found out that there is so much Math and theoretical stuff involved, so I decided to take a different path. I came to the conclusion that Mechanical Engineering is more or less applied Physics so I started to study it.  
I have now finished my first semester with good grades but I have some doubts. First of all, there are some subjects I have no real interest in e.g. technical drawing, machine elements (?), and a bit of material science. Secondly, I don't care about gear wheels, screws etc. So you can say, that I don't like going into the tiny stuff and prefer looking into things from a bigger perspective, if that makes sense. For example, I would like to learn about new technologies and try to apply them to products, do testing etc.
So the question arises, if there a paths in Mechanical Engineering I can follow that don't involve constructing things with billions of little components? My plan is to finish my bachelor and then venture into simulations or energy technology as a master.

I am a person who always doubts his decision and it really annoys me. On top of that, I am someone who has an interest in every subject (talking about high school here), but isn't passionate about any subject. So I lose interest when it goes too deep. I have the feeling that this could/is happen(ing) in Mechanical Enginnering.
Since the start of my academic studies, I have thought about quitting and doing something else, but I think, that I don't find anything that fits me better because my personality is limiting me. I am comforting myself with the fact that Engineering is such a broad field, so that I will surely find the right thing.

I hope, you can understand everything I said because I did some direct translations. If not, just ask :)",AskEngineers,stormrat,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2yuk7n/new_mechanical_engineering_student_here_should_i/

32,Could you put a train on the Lion's Gate Bridge?,1426183258,"Or, perhaps more precisely, what would you need to know to answer that question?

Could one lane of the bridge be converted to a single track rail route for light metro trains? 

*The Bridge:*

[The Lions Gate Bridge](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Lion's_Gate_Bridge.jpg) is a three-lane counter-flow suspension bridge built in 1938 over the salt-water Burrard Inlet in Vancouver, Canada, seeing 60-70,000 vehicles per day   The bridge is 1823 meters long (including the north viaduct). The towers 111 m tall. The bridge has a weight limit of 13 tonnes for trucks, though the bridge regularly carries 18 m articulated buses with an empty weight of 19.15 tonnes and a gross weight rating of 30.29 tonnes 

The bridge was substantially renovated in 2001, when the bridge deck was replaced, with 3.6 m wide lanes and 2.7 m wide sidewalks. It was suggested at the time that the bridge could be double-decked, but that this would require adding height to the towers and replacing the suspension cables or altering the bridge to a cable-stay bridge.  

*The Train:*

Vancouver's driverless Skytrain has two incompatible systems, the linear induction Expo and Millenium lines and the conventionally powered Canada Line.  I will skip the Canada Line, since it's trains are much wider and much heavier than the other lines.  

The Expo and Millenium lines utilize Bombardier's 'Innovia Metro' system, 4 axle cars powered by 600 volt dc third rail and requiring an aluminum reaction rail and power return rail. The maximum operating speed is 90 km/h. The right of way must be entirely segregated. The trains are of two varieties: 

Mark I - built 1985-1994. These have an empty weight of 14.6 tonnes, and a gross vehicle weight rating of 24.5 tonnes.  They must operate in minimum two-car trains. The maximum train length is six cars, though trains on this hypothetical line do not need to be interlined with existing lines.  The cars are 12.7 m long, 2.5 m wide. 

Mark II - built since 2001. These have an empty weight of 21.5 tonnes, and a gross weight rating of 37.67 tonnes. The cars are 17.35 m long, 2.65 m wide, and also must operate as two-car married pairs (though special 1 car units are known to exist on other Innovia systems). The maximum train length is five cars.

The end attached to the dog leg has rotational freedom and a measure of freedom in the x, y and z axes. The problem that I'm running into is the supports and loading of the sample. Because the sample uses a constant cross section, its difficult to seperate the support and the load.


Not only this, but I'm not entirely sure what kind of support is necessary as it needs rotational freedom throughout, but at one end where it is attached in the vice, it has no movement in any axis. I'm thinking that I need a bearing load that is constrained to the Y axis at one end and a rotational support at the other, however I'm not sure how this actually translates to the samples loading/support setup in ansys.

* microcontroller (likely an STM32 L1 or similar)
* GSM/GPRS module
* Bluetooth 4.0 Module
* Input from 20 switches
* Output to 10 solenoids

* It needs to be as low power as possible - part of that being able to switch off peripherals, such as the GPRS/GSM when not in use
* Must work from ~-15F to 110F
* Needs to be environmentally sealed (probably potting/conformal coating)

again this is supposed to be incredibly precise, and one side has to mimic the other completely, which this does not. the sharp edges between the transfer and the dwell are eventually filleted, in order to create a tangent edge so no need to worry about that, aside from the radius of the fillet which i need to find in order to mimic the tangent line on the inner circle (no idea how to do that)
i may be overthinking it, but it needs to be incredibly precise [[[I MEAN THE TIMING, NOT THE CNC CUTTING]]] for what we're working on, otherwise the machine would tear itself to shreds. (no pressure right)

55,Can I power a GPS device with kinetic energy? Details inside.,1426096000,"I am trying to power a GPS tracking device using kinetic energy to transmit the signal. For instance, a bouncing spring or spinning wheel of a bike. I do not want to use battery power, but having the kinetic energy charge a small battery inside the GPS unit would work as well. 

To clarify, the device would not need to be continuously transmitting a signal... only when the GPS has enough power to do so. A few specific questions come to mind: How much power does it take for a GPS to transmit and receive location data? How long (if it's even possible) will it take to generate the required amount of power through kinetic energy (bike wheel, spinning, spring, other motions) in order to meet the minimum power requirements to make the GPS work?

What about a small solar panel to power the GPS?

We are two electrical engineering students (1st year)

**Setup:**

Battery started out fine, then the bike was left out in the rain.  

**The Problem:** 

The battery runs out of power very quickly. However, when left alone, and not charging, it recharges itself to the new limited max capacity.  

**For example:**   The bike dies when I reach my school, but I can ride it home after class.  

We've taken it apart and haven't been able to find and obvious solution.

59,"Jeffrey orbital, angular velocity, and shear rate, how are they all coupled?",1426082576,"So I am trying to model the flow of a spherocylinder (aspect ratio 3) in a linear shear flow.  To validate it, I was trying to compare how the angle of attack changes over time versus the jeffrey orbital.

T (the period in seconds) = 2*pi*(aspect ratio + 1/(aspect ratio)) /(shear rate)= 2*pi*3.333/(shear rate)

Im following this [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250903002148) (specifically eq 25) and I get good results but I'm not sure if they're correct and I'm misinterpretting them or I'm just wrong.

So what is happening is this:

My shear rate is let's say 10 1/s and my vorticity is 10 1/s from the fluid flow simulation.

But then, when I do the angular velocity, I get: angular velocity = 10/2 = 5.  This makes sense to me because my torque is proportional to (.5*vorticity-angular velocity).  And so that makes sense to me since I*d(omega)/dt ~ constant*(.5*vorticity-angular velocity)^2

And so, if my angular velocity = 5, the cylinder will make a 360 degree revolution in 2*pi/(10/2)=2*pi*2/10 but the jeffrey orbital says I should be getting 2*pi*3.333/10.

So you can see the difference is a factor of 3.333/2.  Any thoughts?  Am I interpretting this wrong or did I set up my model wrong?

75,Performance of materials subject to impact,1426018368,"I'm a civil engineer looking at the impact resistance of concrete. I don't have much knowledge in this area, but I would bet that for an application that requires good resistance to impact, concrete would not be a choice material. 

As far as I understand the properties of concrete that make it unfavorable are its hardness and brittleness. When subject to impact, concrete won't deform much since its hard, thus cannot dissipate the energy and will fracture because its brittle. I suppose this means it has a low toughness, since a small deformation causes fracture.

How does the strain-rate effect the fracture? An impact load would cause a very high strain rate, so that makes me wonder if different materials (or concrete mixes) can deform at different rates? For example, a load of magnitude 'x' applied gradually may not crack concrete, however if applied (almost) instantaneously it could. Is this because the material can dissipate energy (by deforming) at a rate equal to the energy being applied to it, and if the material deformation can keep pace it begins to fracture? I have learned that strain rates from impact can be on very different time scales (in civil applications), ex: 10E-6 to 10E-5/s for vehicle collision to 5x10E-2 to 10/s for aircraft landings.

I was wondering if anyone could provide a few (not necessarily civil) applications where impact resistance is an important parameter, the materials commonly used in those applications, and a simplified explanation of the properties that make those materials ideal. I'm trying to look at things from a different perspective, since impact resistance of concrete is usually a more 'secondary' design parameter due to impacts often being a result of an accident - so any resistance to that impact is kind of a bonus.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2ylhen/performance_of_materials_subject_to_impact/

I am hoping to be offered a job where I am currently co-oping although nothing has been mentioned about it. I am hoping an offer comes through by the end, and I would expect that graduating in the fall would help encourage that.

88,Anyone have any suggestions on the best process to vault a 1961 ranch ceiling?,1425957631,"I had posted this over at /r/homeimprovement but I thought it might be a good question to ask here as well.

My family and I have settled into a 1961 ranch on 16 acres with a lake in Georgia. The property is gorgeous, the house is a great size at just under 3100 sq ft and it even has a 2800 sq ft, metal barn. We truly feel this is our forever house.

Previous owners have opened up the floorplan and it's much nicer than it would have been from the original construction, but we've transitioned here from a loft apartment that had 14 ft ceilings, so the 8ft ceilings here feel a bit claustrophobic.

I've seen some great renovations with ranches where they've opened up the ceiling to create a vault by utilizing a ridge beam. I do know that you have to have a stick built roof, which this is. I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with this or has a grasp on what it might take to complete such a task. I'm an avid DIY'r and have self contracted renovations before, but this is a bit beyond my pay grade.

If I were to pick a design that I feel would fit our current floorplan and ridge height, it would have to be this one. It's open, airy and takes an older ranch home and makes it incredibly contemporary.

92,DIY Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to determine minimum particle size in a solution?,1425942786,"So here's my problem: I have samples of carbon nanostructures (primarily a mix of carbon nanotubes/onions etc) in a solution of methanol. Now all these nanoparticles are unfavorably entangled and to disperse the particle conglomerates we have been sonicating each sample. Now I'm sure it would be fine to just to sonicate each sample for as long as possible but it's hardly scientific.

I'd like to determine the point at which the nanostructures are fully dispersed within the solution, so as to know the optimal minimal length of time sonication is required. DLS seems to be the right way of going about it but we don't have a DLS machine in the lab. After doing some research I wonder if I can build a setup that while cannot determine actual particle size would determine the stage at which the minimum particle size was achieved.

Luckily, we do have a deep UV (~220nm) laser and I can easily get a photodetector and oscilloscope. My hypothesis is shining the laser through the sample, and detecting the scattered light with a photodetector I will receive a frequency relative to the particle size due to brownian motion (bigger conglomerates move slower, rate of scattering is low - smaller conglomerates move faster, rate of scattering is high). If I did this in situ of the sonication, the frequency would increase until it hit it's maxima. At this stage, the maximum frequency would be the stage at which the particles were smallest and could not get any smaller (fully dispersed).

Two things which I worry about: 1. The vibration due to the sonication itself would adversely affect brownian motion (I may just have to stop sonicating, do DLS and then sonicate again) 2. I'm chatting bollocks and it just wont work with the apparatus I've got; not accurate/precise enough.

So before I go ahead with all of this, do you think it will work? Any tips, pointers or suggestions? DLS is not my field so any help is beneficial.

94,I've been without a Mech Eng. job for over a year since graduating due to depression that has finally been treated. How should I explain the length of time I've went without engineering work? What things can I do to improve my chances of getting an interview in my situation?,1425939789,"I've tried posting this elsewhere but it was taken down.  I could really use some advice from other engineers and would appreciate it greatly.   I'm NOT looking for resume advice specifically - although that's one of the tangential queries I had.  This is moreso concerning being so long post-graduation and the effect that is going to have on hiring prospects - how I can explain it if I land an interview - and things I can do to improve my chances. I have these anxieties in the back of my mind and would really appreciate some words of wisdom.   Here's a bit more about me:

&amp;nbsp;

I had some crappy things happen after I graduated from a U.C. in NorCal and I spent over a year in a pretty bad depression – It caused me to miss out on an internship experience at a large winery in central california.  I was in a bad mental state, lost all self confidence, and had to get a temp job as a gas station cashier on graveyard shift to make some money to live off of while I searched for mechanical engineering work – but the depression and resulting lack of any confidence in myself meant I wasn’t really looking very much.  The months just flew by burying myself in the internet and before I knew it it’d been over a year and I was still in the same hopeless place. This past November I finally realized that I had to work my butt off to get out of this hole or things were looking pretty dark and I’d never get my life and career going.  I signed up for the A.C.A. and was able to get medical insurance to cover antidepressant medication (which I started taking in college until I graduated and lost the school insurance), and quit the graveyard job which was just making digging out of my depression more difficult .  This along with regular exercise and meditation turned things around immensely and I finally studied and passed the E.I.T. certification test last month and am ready to start my job search.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t have any internship experience – I wasted all my summers in college, something which I regret immensely.  Currently instead of posting my employment history which is full of things like gas station attendant, pizza maker, etc. I’ve opted to instead have a section titled ‘Relevant Experience’ where I list experiences like my Capstone Design project where I worked in a group with the Cal Dept. of Water Resources to develop a prototype UAV soil salinity mapping system.  I garnered a lot of experience there and gained a major interest in control systems design, worked with 3D printing, worked under budgetary and time restraints, and reported to superiors on project progress similar in structure to a business environment.  I figure it's better to list my relevant engineering projects I've worked on rather than irrelevant part time jobs - but I also wonder if it's important to have my employment history just to show that I've at least had a job this past year even if it was as a cashier.  I can't list both or it'll be two pages long - so I'm not sure which is the best course of action.

&amp;nbsp;

To refresh myself I’ve also spent all of my free time since I’ve gotten well brushing up on my CAD skills with all the major CAD programs and FEA suites I can get my hands  on(ProEngineer, Solidworks, AutoCad, COMSOL), and am doing case studies from component design textbooks to keep myself thinking about engineering.    

&amp;nbsp;

While I don’t have any industry experience yet, and academic pursuits are vastly different from industry,   I know I have the capabilities to adapt and learn quickly. I just need that one chance to get my foot in the door that first time so that I can make an impression and I’m confident I will excel. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m full of anxiety about being out of school without engineering employment for such a length of time – a lot of my daily thoughts are about no one giving my resume the time of day once they see that. I’m pushing through that negativity this time though and am not going to let it hold me back.  I’d eventually like to go back to school for my Masters so that I can pursue my life’s goal/passion of working in the space industry – but first I need to get a job anywhere in the field for some years so that I can manage my student loans and get my life moving forward.  I currently live in the East Bay Area so I’m going to be applying to the various oil refineries and power plants in the Martinez area – as well as anywhere else I can find in the rest of the  Bay Area. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading.  I hope this can stay up - I could use any words of wisdom and advice you can give


&amp;nbsp;


Edit:  Thank you so very much to everyone who has taken the time to share their suggestions with me so far. I have a lot more ideas on how to proceed now and most importantly I'm more optimistic and hopeful. And thank you mods for not taking it down - being able to get this advice is helping a lot.

For the past 6 months I've been working as a field inspector for a project that requires me to be temporarily relocated during the week, with a ~4hr one-way trip between my home and the project. Leave home Monday morning, get back on Friday night. This project has multiple phases with this particular phase being 5 of 6 in total. I actually declined the work initially after being told it'd be a 6 month gig - I didn't want to be away from home for this long. They asked again and shortened the timeline from 6 to 4 months. I agreed to take on the project. That 4 months has definitely passed now - when the 4 months rolled around there was no-one else able to inspect and the money was good enough to keep me going. Phase 6 is going to start up in about a month and is slated to last until June.

From what I've gathered, the client has had some issues with our previous phases and was less than happy with some of our work. I've heard that the client has requested that the PM and I continue to work on phase 6 based on our performance on this phase.

If I'm being honest, I'm tired of working so far from home. The money (allowances/overtime/mileage) is nice, but I've stopped caring about that. My parents have been taking care of my dog for the winter and I'm sure they're not enthused about watching her until June either, or checking on my house, mowing the lawn, and clearing snow.

As of late, we have had need to test on very high moisture content lumber.  30% and up.  Most wood we get our hands on is in the 10-25% range.  I am trying to find a way to force water into the wood as letting it sit and soak is a lengthy, inaccurate and messy.  

My first thought is to put some wood samples in a steel drum, fill it with water and pull vacuum on the air gap at the top in an attempt to mimic vacuum marinating systems like [***this***](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81cRyICYxdL._SX522_.jpg).  The more I think about it the more I start to think this won't work.  A few problems come to mind.

   - Can any normal steel drum take a decent amount of vacuum inside as they are not designed for this.  
   - Will it even have the desired effect if it is capable of holding vacuum

My next thought would be to put a piece of wood into a bag with a small amount of water and pull the air out using a vacuum sealer.  This is another popular way people marinate things.  I'm just not sure if it would work.  

After this... I'm stumped.  Or board.  My attention begins to splinter.  It is a knotty problem.

Usually when I'm handed something I'm unfamiliar with, I spend a bit of time wrapping my head around the problem so when I tackle it I'm confident I'm heading in the right direction.

We use the min thickness eq. from ASME B31.3 to calculate our minimum thickness based on design pressure, temperature, and allowable stress inside of the pipe due to pipe pressure as well as structural stress. Something that has been in the back of our minds though is the addition of the ""Intrados"" and ""Extrados"" for bends from the 2000 addenda to the code.

According to this new formula, if we were to plug the intrados for the I in the new min. thickness formula, we would have a minimum thickness larger then our straight pipe section. If we were to plug in the Extrados for the I instead, we would have a lower minimum thickness then our straight pipe section ( sometimes the minimum of the Extrados section would be about half as much as the straight pipe section)

Shouldn't it be the other way around? I don't understand why the outer inner surface of the pipe bend may have a smaller pipe thickness. Wouldn't the outer surface experience more pressure load from the product as it is turning in the pipe? This would lead to a higher rate of corrosion on the outside than the inside which shouldn't be experiencing as much load. Or am I missing something here?

I would greatly appreciate any help on this or just to have a discussion on this topic so that I can understand better what is going on.

Thanks in advance!

17,What is the best way to deal with colleagues trying to make me look guilty to get what they want?,1425879917,"On several occasions on the job, I've noticed that certain colleagues of mine (managers, clients, employees, assholes, etc.), use a particular tactic when discussing work.  They try to put me on the defensive when they're not getting what they want, by making me look guilty of not doing something - something which is made up.  I'm not quite sure what to call it, ""presupposition"" is the closest term I could find.  Generally it goes like this:

*jubjub7*: I'm working on a project to accomplish A-B-C.  It will accomplish A-B-C.

*Colleague*: I understand, it will accomplish A-B-C.

*Both parties sign a requirements document saying it will do A-B-C*

**2 months later**

*Colleague*: When is this going to ready to accomplish D-E-F?
You know you were suppose to build it to accomplish D-E-F.  

It's like they're conveniently ignoring past reality, substituting a new one, and it's all my fault that what I've been working on now doesn't fit the bill.  They also say it so confidently, and they make it sound like I'm in the wrong.  I really want to punch these people in their faces.

Normally what I do is bite my tongue, point out that what I've been working on is to accomplish A-B-C, and show the signed documentation.  But they'll usually just make up some excuse as to why they're right and I'm wrong.  

I can't avoid working with these people.  Is there a good way to handle this type of behavior?

[Can Carbon Dioxide Replace Steam to Generate Power?
The U.S. Department of Energy hopes to create a more efficient turbine that uses CO2 to make electricity](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-carbon-dioxide-replace-steam-to-generate-power/)

Excerpts:

&gt;Now engineers are looking into replacing steam with supercritical carbon dioxide, a technique that could unlock up to 50 percent greater thermal efficiency using a smaller, cheaper turbine.

&gt;...

&gt;""From a thermodynamic perspective, it's a very good process fluid,"" said Klaus Brun, machinery director at the Southwest Research Institute, a nonprofit research and development group. ""You get a fairly efficient cycle and a reasonable firing temperature.""

&gt;In its supercritical state, carbon dioxide is nearly twice as dense as steam, resulting in a very high power density. Supercritical carbon dioxide is easier to compress than steam and allows a generator to extract power from a turbine at higher temperatures.

&gt;The net result is a simpler turbine that can be 10 times smaller than its steam equivalent. A steam turbine usually has between 10 and 15 rotor stages. A supercritical turbine equivalent would have four.

&gt;""We're looking at a turbine rotor shaft with four stages on it that's 4 inches in diameter, 4 feet long and could power 1,000 homes,"" said Richard Dennis, turbine technology manager at the National Energy Technology Laboratory.

I'm working on designing an inertia dynamometer for my university's Baja SAE team. In my research, I've found that the main concern in designing the inertia wheel itself is its tensile strength. Spinning a mass at a fast enough speed will eventually overcome its tensile strength, resulting in a bad day for the shop supervisor. The engine I'm looking to test is a 10 horsepower gasoline Briggs &amp; Stratton that peaks somewhere around 14.5 lb-ft. I'm not worried about overcoming the tensile strength of 1018, the material I think I'm going to use, but in the interest of sound design, and so I know that my creation won't try to kill me too actively, I tried to do the math. 

Unfortunately, I'm a freshman, and as a result, I have yet to take a real mechanics course, and have no idea how to do the math to find the centrifugal force the wheel will see at a given RPM. What I've gleaned from the Internet is piecemeal at best. I've gotten to a number for centrifugal force using the following:

Force = (mw^2 )/r

where m is mass, w is tangential velocity, and r is the radius of the wheel. From there, I divided the force in pounds by the surface area of the sidewall to get the tensile stress in PSI experienced by the wheel's ""rim."" This is the step I'm not sure about, even though the units work out.
This may be accurate, but it probably isn't. I'd like to double check this with one of you learned folk.

Thanks for any help you can give me, or if not, pointing me in the right direction. 

By the way, before y'all go on a physics rant, I know centrifugal force doesn't actually exist- it's a reactive force resulting from the centripetal force. That much I did learn!

However, I can think of a very simple mechanical solution: A continuously rotating cam that would activate a switch for triggering the next wiper cycle. Adjust the rotation speed for different intervals. After all, if I remember well, a cam is (and was at the time of his invention, in 1964) already part of common windshield wiper designs (so that after switching off the wiper, it would still complete the cycle and return to the resting position).

I have in my possession a nearly-working commercial fucking machine.  I think I shorted out something in the motor controller while playing with my multimeter (that's not a euphemism), because I'm an idiot.  I was trying to reverse engineer the pinout for the remote for the motor controller, but I'm pretty sure I just shorted across it instead.  Now the whole thing is dead.  Does it sound right that I probably just blew the controller, and not anything with the motor itself?

Well, forget the controller for now, I have [bigger plans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics)!  Essentially, I want to control the motor of this machine remotely via a networked API.  I'm thinking of writing a simple server for a Raspberry Pi, which will have to control the hardware... somehow?

So, how can I control a motor like this from software?  I have a reasonable level of Arduino experience but I've never dealt with any power at this level.  My knowledge of circuitry is rudimentary at best, and death by mains power is high on my list of fears.

My budget for this project is flexible.  I'd just replace the controller, but I want to take this thing to the next level anyway, and hopefully learn a thing or two about circuitry in the process.

EDIT 1: Ideally I want as full a range of speed control as possible.  The motor only has to go in one direction.

* The motor controller that I destroyed was, in life, a [Dart 15DV1A](http://www.dartcontrols.com/product-guide/analog-dc-speed-controls/15dva/).  It looks like it converts 120VAC into 0-90VDC?  Does that mean that the motor wasn't being pushed to its maximum?  Is it possible to get 130VDC out of 120VAC?

I recently realized through some engineering classes at my school that not only does it make use of my mathematical inclination, engineering is actually a very fun and productive use of my need to be creatively challenged. 

All that being said, I'm a high school junior looking at the engineering programs of colleges like UC Berkeley with very little actual engineering experience. I want to show colleges that I can take initiative and pursue engineering outside of my public education, because currently who I am on paper does not show my newfound interest in engineering. I've tried getting how to books but I don't even know where to start. There's so much I don't know about how things work that it would take years for me to try to attempt any project I've thought of in the past (a holographic keyboard was one I was particularly stuck on). 

Any ideas or even college advice would be very useful! I hope this is the right thread for my question. 

P. S. I'm generally more modest, I was just trying to give you all some background information about my academic career.

52,differential flow gauge in hydraulics,1425683411,"hey all, i'm in my first year of truck and coach technicians apprenticeship classes, and my teacher proposed that we could find the flow in a hydraulic system through bernoulli's principle. he says that if we put a pressure gauge before and after a resistance we could use an unknown equation and find flow rate with the pressure difference and pipe size.

i found a statement saying that the pressure difference is equal to the flow rate squared, not too sure how accurate this is. the equation for that would look something like 
  

(FR)(FR) = A-B

where fr is flow rate, a is the pressure before the restriction, and b is the pressure after the restriction.

this seems far too simple, where is the pipe size? or would this give you inches per second?

can anyone give me the proper equation with a description? any help would be amazing

I can't find a single other program that will do that. I don't really mind what markup to put it in (TeX, mathematica, etc) I just want something I can see as I go.

Priority 2: an Android app that will allow me to this~~

~~TL;DR: I would like to know if there are any interactive math / engineering text editors that I can use for Windows and/or Android.~~

55,What would defrost a windshield the fastest - (low flow)/(high heat) or (high flow)/(low heat)?,1425679629,"Given the weather, I thought I'd ask a simple, but practical, thermodynamics question.

**Scenario:**  You've got an iced windshield and the most practical way to clear it given the tools at hand is to run heat through the defrost.  However, after a certain point, you start to overheat.  Assuming you don't want to leave the car running without you, your choices are:

1.  Leave the temperature on high, but turn the blower down.

2.  Leave the blower on high, but turn the temperature down.

**Question:** Which option will melt the ice the fastest?

I know that there are some ambiguous quantities here.  Assume the most typical values for highest temperature and blower settings.  Assume the lowered temperature is around 70 degF, and that the lowered blower level is around 50% of maximum.


Given that glass has a relatively low thermal conductivity, my personal guess is:

1.  (Low flow)/(high temp) results in more thermal energy being wasted at the part of the windshield that defrosts first (i.e. right where the defrost vents are aimed), so that part of the glass will defrost quickly, but it will take longer to defrost the whole windshield.  

2.  (High flow)/(low temp) distributes the thermal energy more evenly across the entire windshield, so it might take longer before you see it start to work, but the overall job will be done faster.

58,"Should I report my old company for improper stamp usage and forged signatures(Ontario, PEO)?",1425674155,"I left my old company for a better job and I recently got an email from [PEO about enforcing P. Eng seals](http://www.peo.on.ca/index.php/ci_id/28511/la_id/1.htm). After reading it, there were some things that were of great concern for me. The main one being that the person we use for the P.Eng stamp has never set foot in the office the whole time I've been working there. There hasn't even been a room or office for him. A long time employee told me that the P.Eng person ""trusts"" them but I'm pretty sure the person gets a hefty sum every year.

We use his digital P.Eng stamp for permits which every employee had access to. For things outside of Toronto, there's a different form that has to be filled where they forge his signature with a laminated template that they tape on and scan after. Normally, this wouldn't bug me since we have one other P.Eng (whose stamp we don't use) and he looks over only some of the projects (I'd say 20%). What does bug me though is that projects still get sent out when he's on vacation from employees who I feel can put projects at serious risk. This is for a small electrical consulting firm and I've seen first hand a project go wrong where they had to pay a fine to fix things as load calculations weren't done properly due to trusting a  long time CADD technician working there to take over a project. 

I am not sure if this is grounds for reporting a company but I feel the ethical thing to do is to report them as I feel that they can put some projects at risk. Like I said, only one P. Eng really works there and even then he doesn't stamp or look over all the projects.",AskEngineers,whistleblowpeo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2y67hp/should_i_report_my_old_company_for_improper_stamp/

###Voting, comment quality, and reporting

AskEngineers isn't a high-traffic sub, so the focus is on quality and discussion. However, I've made a few observations about the vote behavior of the users here:

1. The vote score on new threads almost always hits zero for whatever reason (bots, lurkers, etc.), which hurts its chances of getting the attention it needs to get answers. I have vote score hidden on threads and comments for the first hour of its life to mitigate this, but it's not perfect and doesn't always work.

2. Threads that are easier to digest get highly upvoted, whereas more technical engineering questions tend to get much fewer votes, and are sometimes even negative. [This is pretty normal](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_comment_moderation), but it would be better if more of the harder questions floated to the top of 'hot' so they can get more attention.

What can you do about it? I'd like everyone to start by generally following these voting guidelines:

* **Upvote** if a user asks a legitimate engineering question, gives a good answer, or contributes to engineering discussion.

* **Downvote** if a user asks a poor question, gives a bad/wrong answer, is completely off-topic, or breaks a subreddit rule. If there is a thread you'd rather not see, click 'hide' instead of downvoting an otherwise legitimate post.

* **Do not downvote simply because you disagree.** If you downvote, leave a comment explaining why you did... if you can't bother to do that, then don't vote at all.

Finally, don't be afraid to use the 'report' button below a post if you think it breaks one of the subreddit rules. I've always gone by the spirit of the rules rather than the letter, so most borderline cases won't get removed, but I'm not on reddit 24/7 and therefore can't catch everything. At the same time, please DO NOT use the 'report' function as a ""super downvote""... that's not what it's there for. If you strongly disagree with someone, downvote and leave a comment.

My goal is eventually to be in a position where I'm actually designing things. So I have two questions:

1. Is this type of experience going to be valuable for eventually getting into a design position? Or is it difficult to transition from manufacturing to design? 

2. While I'd be happy doing any design at all, in an ideal world I would like to design medical devices. That's what I studied and find most interesting. Is it a mistake to jump into the aerospace industry early in my career?

79,Thinking About Getting a New Job Across the Country,1425650203,"Hello All, 

Thanks for reading. I’m sure I’m not the first one who has done this, but I’m looking for everyone’s $0.02 on the matter.

I've been working as a Mechanical Engineer at a medium sized construction management and engineering firm for 1.5 years. I size and specify utility equipment for factories; equipment such as hot water boilers, steam boilers, chillers, cooling towers, condensers, compressors, pumps, and control valves. Once equipment is specified, I work with piping designers to produce piping drawings and I write a scope of work for installation of said equipment. I then travel to the job-site and supervise installation, handle change orders, and drive schedule. Not a bad gig at all really. This is my first job out of college. I’m currently making $70K per year in Eastern Massachusetts. 

The idea of doing similar down south, preferably in Florida or Georgia keeps running through my mind. I’ve tried to shake the idea several times, keep my head down and keep plugging away in Eastern, MA but I can’t seem to keep focused. I’m serious about moving down South, it’s like it’s calling for me. I’ve pretty much had it with the cold weather, harsh winters, ridiculous cost of living, and asinine politics up North (no offense people). 
Has anybody else ever said screw it, found a job elsewhere in the country, put in their 2 weeks and moved? It sounds crazy to me at the moment, but I’m 24 years old, single, no-debt and feel like I have the opportunity this now- Or never. 

I obviously wouldn’t leave my current employer without anything lined up. I’m just asking, what’s your experience and thoughts on my thoughts?

Happy Friday.

The survivors have it pretty cushy they have access to vast reserves of  materials,  food and machinery.

However the last two have a finite lifespan:-

Properly stored rice and pluses can last 25 years perhaps longer, sugar and honey last indefinitely.  So survivors will need a well functioning agriculture by that point.  This is not too hard there is cleared land seed stocks and people experienced in farming.

The machinery has it harder,  I estimate  that modern motor cars would start to become problematic after about 10 years as tyres and spare parts start to go long beyond their shelf life.  Cuba has managed to keep a population of classic cars 'roadworthy' since the blockage started in 1962. This is sort of moot as the stocks of diesel and petrol start to go off within a year

After 25 years the electrical supply is starting to get a bit dodgy as the wind farms, hydro and solar photovoltaic arrays hit the end of their lifespan.

On that note, are there any other counter-intuitive facts about an engine that are not discussed in a regular discussion about a two or four stroke engine?

Basically, if my thinking is correct: assuming that your extension is strong enough to twist to a point and stop before the given torque value, 100% of the torque will be transferred to the bolt through the extension, although more work will have been done to overcome the torsion of the extension, the torque value would end up the same at both ends. My coworker however thinks that you are losing torque through the extension.

I will gladly give gold to thorough responses.  I am doing some research on a possible school project but I'm running into a hurdle not having any precedent for this.  

Many people assume I am talking about modular construction, but I don't think that's necessarily what it's called. Picture a type of lattice where individual members can be removed and then ""stuck"" elsewhere.

I am envisioning a building that can be disassembled and reassembled into a variety of forms via a steel frame.  Roofs/walls/floor would be made up ""cartridge"" panels that could be inserted in a variety of locations depending on the overall configuration of the building.

I have not been able to find a precedent for this type of building, but I am wondering if it is even possible.  Assuming the connections and lengths of steel matched up, would this be possible? The overall idea is to deconstruct and reconstruct a building into different forms over a period of time (say, 200 years).  The concept is Design for Deconstruction/Reconstruction.

34,"Electrical engineering VS Computer science, in terms of future proofness.",1425483033,"So, let me start off with this - I think this is in the right place. If not, please direct me to another sub that is better suited for this type of question. Alos is proofness even a word?

Anyway, the thing is that I want to get into software development and really understand how the programs on computers and mobile devices work, especially the math behind all of it. The reason for this is that I want to use this knowledge to develop software in the medical industry, like simulations of neuralnetworks etc. 

However the problem is that from what I have read on diffrent forums on the interwebs it seems like ""software engineering"" is not a future proof career. And what I mean by this is not that I expect to come out of univerisity (i live in sweden, and we get our degrees from universities, I'm not quite clear on what collage really is but this is not relevant anyway.) and never have to learn anything ever again. I have no problem with the idea of learing new things even after ""school"", but it seems like once one reaches age 45 the industry looks down on you and you're regarded as someone that is not on the same level as the younger graduates. 

So I have 2 questions: 

1. Is this the case even in hardware engineering feelds that require a degree in EE? Ofcourse I expect to learn new things outside of school even with an EE degree but I feel like since that route of education is more based on physical laws that basically has not changed for tha past 150 years, one should still be regarded as employable even at a higher age. 

2. Am I worrying too much about none issues? Should I just focus on what I think I will enjoy and focus on becomming the best in that field instead of worrying about beeing employable later in life?

However, as someone stated (mbillion), the company would kind of ""own"" that person. They would be very unlikely to be accepted as an engineer at another company in a different field.

Lastly, professional engineers obviously need to have a degree (prerequisite for the test) and also the ability to officially sign off on documents should be limited to those who have proven themselves 

I really appreciate the responses, you have all changed my prospective 

TL;DR Education, license, profession.

Those are the 3 reasons people use to justify the title Engineer. All are valid but not equal.

59,Help with understanding how Arduino works with XBee!,1425398707,"Another student informed me that rather than use wires and a slip ring to control a drive motor for a 4 track arm robot, I could mount an XBee microcontroller, a dual driver, and Xplorer shield.  

So a quick explanation of how I'm trying to get this to work. Each ""arm"" will have a drive sprocket attached to a pancake motor that will drive treads. I was going to wire this motor using the slip ring but that proved to be to costly since it would have to be a custom build and it has to be very small and I couldn't find one online. The Arduino Mega will be mounted to the chassis of the robot and the XBees (4 of them) will be mounted to each track arm (4 motors).

61,Why I was denied from TS/SCI full scope clearance... and now reapplying for DOD Secret,1425397910,"So, long story short, I was denied by a CIA-sponsored TS/SCI full scope poly clearance in Aug 2014 for ""personal conduct"" and ""drug use"" reasons, that I think are BS:

1) Not reporting having smoked weed on the SF-86 (I smoked in Feb 2014 and on three other occasions a couple years ago) but admitting it to the examiner when I found out I wouldn't be incriminating myself

2) visiting an academic coach/counselor at my university and not admitting it on the SF-86 as ""mental health"" problems


So here's my question: I'm now being resubmitted for a DOD Secret clearance. I'm already nervous enough about having to admit being denied for a prior clearance on the SF-86. I'm planning to just not even mention the academic coaching/counseling on the new SF-86 out of fear the examiner will blow it out of proportion again like last time.

Should I be worried about leaving that information out even though I don't feel I'm lying about it? Will the DOD be able to see my whole investigative file from the CIA?

I quit my job to take a shot at pursuing a hobby of mine professionally (music production/audio engineering).

Out of college my job was producing custom precast electrophoresis gels and designing production tools and accessories. In the past 3 years, while pursuing music, my day-job was largely administrative but I got extensive experience in Lean as applied to business processes and earned Bronze level Lean certification.

65,Does GD&amp;T ALWAYS increase the cost of a part?,1425388981,"On first thought you would think yes, but after really thinking about the consequences, I am thinking not. It simply communicates the intended purpose of the feature, and allows for manufacturing to understand what the designer deems most important about a part.

Obviously you wouldn't use GD&amp;T on features that aren't important, but something like hole patterns would completely render a part useless if they weren't manufactured correctly. Now you have the scrapped part, and twice the labor, and you still haven't directly defined what you want the manufacturer to do.

If I tell someone to clean the kitchen, they could spend hours doing the dishes, wiping down counters, scrubbing floors, etc. and they still may skip over a task that I would deem crucial and they wouldn't have even thought of. On the contrary, if I say I need for them to take out the trash, do the dishes, and mop the floors, it could be drastic in the amount of time saved and I get exactly what I want done.

Ok, halfway through my undergrad and am only now getting into the roots of math. For fun I like to mess with things like MATLAB to get to know the software. I have a leg up with it because of a family member who is an engineer and ""feeds me"" projects that he has finished so I have actual data to work with; it's fun. I am 100% committed to finishing this degree but money is a major hurdle for me. As you all know, an engineering degree can consume a lot of your time and so working is difficult, I live off my small paycheck from my financier so I get by and loans are not an option as this is my second degree. I need work, I prefer to start working, in some form, in the field I am studying, what are some options for me? How do I convince a potential internship or employer that I am better (because possibly of age) than the farther along students that apply?

I live in Florida but I'm trying to move to a better school in a better area for the industry based on what I want to end up doing.

Bottom line, do I have a shot or should I wait? 
Do I have a better shot than younger students?
What are some good ideas (if you have any) for potential work?
How would I approuch them with my interest to get them to consider me?

Here is some back round: I just transferred into a top 25 public university from a technical college. I am currently enrolled the general engineering program, and have had plans (up until now?) to major in ChemE. I transferred in with a near 3.9, having taken Calc 1-3, Chem 1 and 2, and some other gen eds. As far as the ChemE curriculum goes at my new school, I am a few engineering classes, and 2 physics classes short from officially declaring my major. This semester however, I have been STRUGGLING. 

I am ashamed to admit it, but I just bombed my first physics with cal 1 test (made a 69), and failed my engineering skills class (which is only a quarter class) with a 68. The engineering skills class is the one that I am most concerned about, as it is basically just dimensional analysis and unit conversions, yet somehow I managed to the butcher my grade. 

I have really enjoyed math and science subjects my whole life, but there seems to be a disconnect when it comes to application. Is this a bad sign of things to come? If I cant grasp the very basic fundamentals, do I stand a chance when it comes to the more rigorous materials like thermo?

On the other hand, my current grades in both Ochem and Calc 4 are great, so its not that I cant do the harder stuff necessarily.

I am a Software Engineer that graduated school about 2 years ago.

I am currently an employee at a semi-startup (Company 10 years old).  We are currently having some money issues due to our main project now producing the results we were quite expecting.  Due to this, I was not able to get a yearly raise which is understandable due to the situation, but unfortunate because this past year I put in a ton of extra work and my boss was duly impressed.

A couple weeks ago, I was approached by a recruiter for a top Washington based company and given the opportunity to take a test for a hiring event they were holding.

86,"Electrical Engineers - Question about 12V DC batteries, amp hours, and 3 phase chargers",1425307187,"Intro (skip if impatient)

I race [electric arrive and drive race karts](http://i.imgur.com/Cb4pAI4.jpg) and last night at the K1 Speed GP (grid start race) myself and many of the other regular drivers were posting terrible times by our standards and we all agreed the karts felt slow.  We believe the track has been trying to run batteries into the ground.  So, I'd like an EE to back up that my theory is correct on this matter.

Real question:

These [karts](http://i.imgur.com/Cb4pAI4.jpg) run on 4 Optima batteries (I think it's [this one](http://www.optimabatteries.com/en-us/shop/bluetop/optima-batteries-8016-103-d34m-bluetop-marine-boat-deep-cycle-starting/), but I'm not 100% sure) and are charged by a 3 phase charger with a display similar to [this](http://www.gempower.biz/images/3500_WIC_LCD2.jpg) (though it doesn't have a percent of charge, but it looks very similar to this and the ""Ah"" I'm referring to looks the same).  They run 48V 8kW AC motors.

When the manager showed me the charger and how it works, he said he waits for ""the charge number to drop below 2"", which turns out he was looking at the amps going into the battery which makes sense as it usually is around 12 or so amps while charging.  Next to that, I saw an ""Ah"" or ""amp hours"" gauge.  One kart was almost completely charged and said ""4 Ah"" and another one was still charging and said ""10 Ah"".  On a typical charger for these types of lead-acid batteries, would that amp hour rating refer to how much charge these batteries have available to give, or how much the charger is inputting?  If this is the charge of the battery, these batteries should actually be somewhere like 200 Ah total (for 4) based on the data for these batteries.  Even assuming it's a decimal place off, it means a ""good"" one was 100 Ah and a bad one was only 40 Ah.  This would explain why the karts all felt slow and continued to get worse as the races went on.  I even had my kart flat out stall on me twice during the final race, which really pissed me off since I was 2nd of 26 drivers for the season going into this race and I finished 17/20 due to such a piece of shit kart, so god only knows how bad my position is now.  Nobody working there even understands what an ""amp"" is, so having some ammo to show them they are doing it wrong would help show them some of the batteries are in need of replacement.

I understand this is somewhat frivolous of a question, but I know engineers like two things: being right and knowing the answer right away, so I'm sure at least one of you won't mind taking a second to be both right and know the answer right away.

I'm still a year out from having to make a final decision, but it's never too late to start thinking. When I graduate from college, I'd like to become an Air Force reservist in addition to a normal engineering career. The problem is, since the job I want is an aircrew job, in total it comes out to about 8 months of active duty training. So, right now, my plan stands that I would begin training right after I graduate college and just begin my first job later than most.


Here's where the issue lies for me. I know taking a year off isn't unheard of, especially for a valid reason. But, most people I've known have gotten a job from either a campus career fair or an intern full-hire offer, and I'm worried that I could find myself lost when I return.


* If I were to, say, receive a full-hire offer from an internship. What would I do? Is it possible to postpone the offer for so long? I know it differs between companies, but I'm curious what people think in general.


* Would I be at any significant disadvantage by going into the job search late? How hard is it to find your first job without campus resources?


* The job itself isn't related to mechanical engineering, but is something I am still very interested in. C17 Loadmaster, doing humanitarian airdrops etc. I like the idea of becoming more well-rounded, but am I shooting myself in the foot by leaving for a year and returning with no engineering-related experience?

39,[Help] Static head in a venturi arrangement,1425054714,"A while back I done an experiment in which I passed fluid through a venturi and took note of the heads at each of the pressure taps. Pressure taps 1 and 4 were on the part of the pipe that had the same cross section whereas pressure taps 2 and 3 were on the bit where the cross section was reduced.
I would've guessed that the heads at pressure taps 1 and 4 would be of negligible difference, but it turned out that 4 had a lower head than 1 but still higher than the others.

I've come up with two ideas as to why:

1) Primarily due to the pressure taps between 1 and 4 acting as pressure 'leaks'; converting the kinetic energy of the flow into potential energy holding up the columns of fluid.

2) Partially due to the friction against the walls of the manometer and venturi and viscosity of the fluid.

Am I thinking correctly?

Edit: Here is the schematic: http://imgur.com/BfPLNM1

In the first case where h1 and h4 connect to a tube with the same CSA and volumetric flow rate we'd expect the heads (height water reaches) to be the same. In the second case, as we have more pressure tappings in between I believe they would convert some of the kinetic energy going through into potential energy for the column of water and as such h4 will be lower than h1. In both cases friction and viscosity will also reduce the head of water in h4 but perhaps not so much compared to the potential energy loss.",AskEngineers,Gangstuh_Nugget,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2xd57z/help_static_head_in_a_venturi_arrangement/
40,Help Selecting Sensor(s),1425048583,"Hey, I just want to preface by saying thanks for reading and please let me know if this is in the wrong subreddit/there is a better place for this.

I am looking into a personal project where I will require the use of some kind of sensor(s) for the following situation:

I will have two relatively fixed points, point A and point B. These will, on average, be ~7 inches apart. I want to implement a sensor in point A and/or B (or potentially a sensor in one and reader in the other) that monitors the distance between these points, and can send a signal when it goes above or below a certain distance threshold (let's say, above 10 inches or below 4.) I need these to be fairly accurate, cheap, and ideally very small (maybe 5x5 mm.) There is no line of sight between them, and orientation is relatively fixed but I can't say with a 100% certainty that they would stay that way thus wouldn't be reliable.

EDIT: Since this seems relevant, I will include it:
The idea is for two earbuds to have these sensors included, such that when the earbuds are being worn they would be within the allotted distance (whatever a comfortable range is from ear to ear for a human head) and when they are removed and put together or spread apart a signal could be sent. This is why orientation is relatively fixed, but since everyone's ears are shaped differently there isn't going to be a consistent angle they are set at. The idea is to create a circuit board in each earbud housing that contains these sensors, so they can be wired.

Is there some kind of sensor out there that might fulfill this criteria? I have looked into RFID tags and done some initial proximity sensor research, but haven't quite narrowed it down to something of my scope.

Very glad this subreddit exists! I'm hoping I can leverage your knowledge and expertise for a startup I am working on.

Essentially we are trying to make 3D printing more affordable for the average person who does not own a 3D printer. We're just validating assumptions right now and trying to determine who exactly our target market is and which groups we can provide real value to. As engineers I imagine you use addictive manufacturing for many of your prototyping needs, and I'm curious if our value prop would resonate with you.

Would you use a platform that allowed you to upload your CAD/STL file to a semi-private job board so 3D printing studios could bid and compete for your business? We're also encouraging independent owners of 3D printers to come on board to print and ship basic models, but at a much lower cost than a professional printing hub would charge.

49,"Why do most gun calibers are never lower than 5 or 4mm in diameter ? Is it because of hydrostatic shock, or because of maximum barrel pressure ?",1424992717,"What happens when you use an ammunition like the 5.56, with the same amount of propellant, but with half the bullet diameter, and same bullet weight ?

It would result in a longer bullet, so more aerodynamic, and more ability to pierce, and maybe a little more stable in flight, and still about the same amount of energy.

I've heard about rifle that shoot arrows (but it's impractical). The FN fiveseven pistol is a good example of that concept: a reduced caliber, much higher velocity, and maybe about the same power of a 9mm.

I would have thought that lower calibers are not possible for the following reasons:

* Hydrostatic shock is a thing, and calibers too low have been somehow forbidden. (the ""fast and small"" bullet).

* Stopping power is preferred, but I still wonder how a small caliber with same energy would perform in terms of range and precision. It might even favor smaller weapon systems with similar range (guns don't always need to be lethal or to feature stopping power)

* Even the best steels would not bear the much higher hydraulic pressure generated by a much smaller barrel caliber (with as much propellant of a 5.56)

* For some reason, the ballistic are not that good, but I don't understand why.

Such lower caliber guns would be fun to shoot, they would not be as lethal (which is not necessarily a bad thing). For example, an 3mm ammunition with as much propellant of a 9mm.

My girlfriend had an internship at a military base last year.

The catch is she found it horrible. They didn't do any design or engineering. She spent all her time in a small cubicle mostly doing nothing or occasionally writing paperwork no one would ever read. And no matter who or how often she asked, they wouldn't give her more to do. She has to decide if she wants to cut and run, risking working a service or retail job this summer if she cant find a different internship.

However, my calculations do not include the dissipation of energy as the energy is transplanted from the object to the plate to the water.

Now, I have a steel plate. Let's say 2m X 2m. There is a steel pillar connected to each of the corners of the plate. The pillars are 1m long and standing on the floor.

So,the point of this structure is to protect some equipment on the seafloor from random objects falling on it. This structure needs to be able to absorb 20kJ from an object that hits the plate with an impact circle of 500mm diameter and survive.

In air, this causes large deflections on the plate. In water, these deflections have to push the water away effectively dampening the impact.

89,I don't have any experience with magnets. Can anyone help me size something that will have enough pull?,1424842590,"[Figure of the situation](http://i.imgur.com/oZSPxGc.png).

Basically I have a very tiny pin that is in a hole. It needs to be pulled in some way to compress a spring. There is no access to the top side of the plate, only the side where ""Some magnet"" is shown is accessible. My initial idea was to drill a hole through the pin and pull on it with fishing line but attempting to drill 1mm holes in steel today proved impossible. My next best idea is a magnet.

The spring compresses under 5 lb of force, and the magnet would start at 2.5mm away and get as close as 1mm away. Using [this website](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/calculator.asp?calcType=disc), I know that something like a 1""x1"" disc magnet would pull with 25 lb of force on a plate 2.5mm away. However I'm sure the force is less with a much smaller piece of steel like a tiny pin. Also that big of a magnet is expensive and dangerous, as there would need to be multiple magnets in the same vicinity (there are multiple pins).

This beam is the main structure, unfortunately, and so I can't fix it to a strong base, so how can I reinforce it best to limit this kind of twisting? I was thinking of using thin carbon fiber strips along either side of the vertical section of the beam, to reinforce it laterally anyways, so if the solution can utilize that in some way it would be awesome. Any ideas? Because I'm stumped.

Naturally the first thing I did was look through the academic literature. Again and again the program TRNSYS came up as **the** software to use for such things. However literate I am with technology I do not want to spend the time to learn the software. I read that it is possible to create a TRNSED stand-alone application to TRNSYS and I I would like to know how feasible it would be to hire someone to do that for me, what are some things I would have to consider, etc.

Some more details: what it would look like from my end (user end) is I am able to input the area of the greenhouses in square meters (the greenhouses would all have the same standardized design) and some site-specific parameters: solar radiation, heating and cooling degree days, etc., and the software would spit out how many kW of energy I need to operate the building annually.

Secondly, im not sure if this is in the right subreddit so if its not please let me know where i should ask and ill try again. Thanks
Ok my question relates to actuators and/or valves for HDPE pipe (or any pipe i guess really).
I have a long length of 315mm dia HDPE pipe with some 200mm dia HDPE coming off it every 100m or so. There will be salt water running through the 315mm pipe driven by a pump at one end. The water will run towards the pump only.
I am looking to put a valve/actuator on the 200mm pipe so when i pump the larger pipe i can turn off all but one of the 200mm pieces. Then i can pump dead fish from the 200mm down the 315mm and into a holding tank, but if i just have them all open and free without valves the pump will not have enough pull to get the water from the very end of the pipe to the pump.
The valves i have looked at are butterfly valves with electronic actuators on them, but when they are open they restrict the flow as the gate part is still in the pipe. This would allow the fish to get stuck sometimes. 
So what i am asking is:
1. what automatic valves are there that can do the job im after.
2. do they have to be electronic? can they be pneumatic or hydraulic?
3. is there other types apart from the butterfly valves?
4. is there a completely different way i might be able to do this? (i may just have this all wrong and there might be an easier and cheaper way)
I have some pics that may help explain.
If anyone needs any more info or has any questions please feel free to ask. I am wiling to consider giving gold to the person who solves this problem for me, but only after its solved.
Again, thanks for reading.

13,What are the real limitations of these electrical parts?,1424760360,"I'm attempting to create a 500W DC load bank to test our small aircraft power system. As an aerospace engineer, this is just beyond the reaches of my sorcery.

I've selected five 100W 12V light bulbs to connect in parallel. I'll also have a dimmer switch in the circuit to vary power, but I can remove some light bulbs if I want to get better resolution at lower power levels.

Thing is, our power supply outputs 14.5 VDC in order to charge our eccentric onboard battery. Do light bulbs typically fail from over-voltage, or is it the current that does the job? If it's just the current, I guess I can leave it on 14.5 V and regulate the current with my dimmer switch.

On the subject of the dimmer switch, I noticed some nice variable output potentiometers (most importantly inexpensive) on [McMaster](http://www.mcmaster.com/#variable-output-switches/=w1lgke). All of these potentiometers are rated at less than 5 Watts... and the high-wattage ones on digikey are hella expensive. Yet, I can walk into my local home depot and pick up a 600 Watt dimmer switch (with a lot lower resolution) for like five bucks! What are household dimmer switches smoking!?

Is the power rating on those potentiometers the power consumed in the circuit, or just the power consumed by the potentiometer? Or is it yet another current limit in disguise? These things are rated for 2 Watts at like 480 VAC, but what can I get at 12 VDC?

I know V=IR, but I'm having trouble understanding the exact nature of this equipment's limits.",AskEngineers,scurvybill,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2wyrpx/what_are_the_real_limitations_of_these_electrical/
14,I need some electrical engineering help designing a timer-based circuit,1424760058,"I have a 1966 Ford Thunderbird that I am fixing up and getting ready to sell. 

The turn signals are sequential lights that are unique to the model.

 There is a bank of 3 lights at the rear, and one light up front. The front light and the rear center light turns on, then the middle light, then the outer light, After all 4 are on, all of the lights turn off.

[Here is a link to a video of the lights.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYoSbTdzaVA&amp;feature=youtu.be) 

From the factory, this was accomplished with a 12V DC motor and a gearbox fitted to a cam that switches 4 contacts. The duration and order of each light is determined by the size of each cam lobe. 

[Here is a link showing the mechanism working.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uajESuBcm78&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Recently the DC motor stopped working, and the only replacement I can find is an electronic version that sells for $100. I am certain that the same function could be accomplished for a whole lot cheaper- I'm a student on a tight budget and the car has already cost me far too much.

I'm a mechanical engineering student with some experience in electronics but not a whole lot. I suspect that the circuit will be timer-based, and that I will need variable resistors so that I can set the duration correctly. I am hoping for a solution that is not purely time based, as if the lights become slightly out of sync if they are on long enough, it would ruin the effect. Some sort of rudimentary logic would be nice. 

A lot of the sequential light tutorials I have seen show the lights turn on and off one after another, but I am having difficulty finding a way to have it so that the lights ""stack"" in a sense.

I am also interested in using relays in order to retain some of the original clicking sound instead of a purely solid-state solution.

--------
*Background*

We're learning about stress-shielding in my Biomechanics class and how much higher the modulus for metals is than for bone.  The big issue is that the metal takes the load away from the bone because it's so much stronger, and that results in bone loss.

(Mini case study to come?),1424748287,"I came across the Seek Thermal camera ($270 on amazon last week for the extended range/manual focus one) on a recent video review from Tested. I showed it to my boss and he was instantly on board. Neat.

We have some projects in mind for it. For the price, we don't care about destroying one or two if it means getting some useful information. I'll be putting it on a micro USB extension cable to keep my phone out of harm's way. I was playing with it today (this video is sort of inspirational: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOcZFPLX67k) and was checking some stuff out in the shop.

I found this: http://imgur.com/1IvZBJT

Terminal blocks on the left are cold as a cod (L1). The right (L2), not so much.

This is a 220V single phase machine. Everything seems to be running fine. It's only pulling 18 amps.

I'll be digging into this with the tech who did the wiring tomorrow. I just thought this would be interesting to demonstrate how a thermal camera CAN be useful as the prices continue to fall. Maybe this can be a bit of a case study, we'll see what I find tomorrow.

Oh yeah, any recommendations on possible causes would be great! I'll post more information as I gather it.

18,Sizing a water chiller to balance out temperature increase of a water system from a burner.,1424743805,"Hello, I am an engineering undergrad and I am designing and assembling a closed water recirculation system to measure the heat output of a burner. 

To give a little bit of insight: There will be a 2000 degree Fahrenheit flame being applied directly over a copper pipe with deionized/distilled water pumped through it at 1 gallon per minute. There are thermocouples inside the pipe to measure the water temperature before and after the flame which can be used to calculate the BTU output of the flame. The water typically heats up 10 degrees between the before and after thermocouples.  Additionally, the ambient temperature will typically be around 70 degrees Fahrenheit and there are about 10 gallons of water running through the system. 

One requirement is that I will need to incorporate a water chiller to make sure that the water will be at 60 degrees Fahrenheit when it hits the thermocouple just before the flame application area. I want to make sure I find a chiller with the correct cooling capacity as it will be a pretty pricey unit. 

 I calculated the maximum output of the flame using the hydronic BTU formula as follows: 500 x (1 GPM) x (10 degrees) = 5,000 BTU/hr

The main question I have is, can I simply match the heat input into the system with the cooling capacity of the chiller to take that heat out of the system? For example, at 5,000 BTU/hr with 20% oversizing, I am thinking about purchasing a 6,000 BTU/hr chiller (0.5 refrigeration tons). I am fairly new to this so I am trying to approach this task with caution. 

Some assumptions that I am making (hopefully correctly) is that since this system will only be on for very short periods of time, any heat going into the system from the environment or the pump will be negligible. 

Thank you for any insight you can give me at all or anything you think I might have missed or might be doing incorrectly. ",AskEngineers,Unded,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2wxy77/sizing_a_water_chiller_to_balance_out_temperature/

20,Would a coastal breakwater with an underwater pass-through prevent siltation/tombolos/erosion or fail horribly?,1424734124,"For example, let's consider [Port Orford, Oregon](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Port+Orford,+OR,+USA/@42.7390982,-124.4959615,1816m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x54c4ceffa19a8e71:0xa198b7e548bab16f). In the 60's the Army Corps extended a locally-built breakwater to protect the boat cranes and equipment from southern storms, but in so doing the breakwater prevented sand from migrating along the coast. The resulting siltation fills in the boat launch area every few years, requiring regular expensive dredging. [a better encapsulation of the problem at Port Orford is here](http://orsolutions.org/osproject/port-orford)

This type of problem seems to be a fairly common byproduct of breakwater construction, with the other side of the coin being erosion. There is a port in Chiapas, Mexico where the town on the other side of a perpendicular breakwater has been literally washing away from erosion, and to combat it they're dropping enormous boulders on what used to be an important tourism beach. 

It got me thinking: is there some way to dissipate coastal wave energy while allowing sand to continue its lateral migration? What if your breakwater looked like a long, 20-ft tall triangular prism with a 5-10 foot gap at seafloor level (let's assume the ocean is 12-feet deep or so) to allow water to pass underneath while making the surface-level waves climb a triangular slope? Alternatively, what if current breakwater designs were built on a row of those concrete highway culverts to allow water to pass under?

I had to disclose my current salary as part of the application process, but the expected salary for this job was not given.  Didn't give it much thought at the time, figured we can talk about pay if and when the time comes.  I got invited for an interview, which I was thrilled about!

A few days later, I received an e-mail notification from a job site I've subscribed to, advertising the exact same role I've got an interview for, and undoubtedly for the same company.  However, in this advert, the expected salary is specified as being in the range £45k - £55k!

This is great to see from my perspective.  However, my question is, when the “expected salary” question comes up during the interview, would it be reasonable to mention that I saw the job posted on a careers site with a starting salary of £45k, so this is what I expect?  Even if I’m earning considerably less now?  How else can I play this situation when the time comes?

This really is a dream job.  As an engineer, I’m motivated by the work I’m doing and the “thing” I’m building day-to-day.  I just don’t want to be taken advantage of in a situation like this.

I live in Alberta and I have a co-op work term starting in May 2015. I'm an electrical engineering student with my main interests in electronics, embedded systems,c.

For my last work term, I worked at an electrical utility company. While the money was amazing, it was incredibly boring and I didn't like power systems a lot.

So for this round, I was a lot more picky with internships, favoring the electronic ones. Unfortunately, given the recent turns in the economy and the rarity of the electronics industry in this province, my options have gone limited.

I'm considering taking any job at this point (is this a good idea?). I am looking up a posting for Cost Engineering. Upon reading it, seems like a fancy word for finance. I do like financial stuff, I have my on investment portfolio myself!

As a side question, would my internships potentially pidgeon hole me? I plan on relocating to a city with better prospects of the type of industry I want to be in, I am just worried of the work experience I'm getting under my belt.

48,"For measurement devices: How much of an increase in cost can be expected for an increase in precision of 1 significant digit (in other words, a 10x increase in precision)?",1424637730,"I have heard that a 10x increase in precision typically is accompanied by a 100x increase in cost. As in, for a ruler accurate to the mm compared to a calliper accurate to a tenth of a mm, one may expect the calliper to be 100x more expensive than the ruler. 

Is this true? What would a function modelling precision to cost look like, would it be linear or exponential? I would expect increments in significant digits at the lower end of the spectrum (say, m to cm) to cost significantly less than 100x, and increments at the higher end of the spectrum (lets say at the subatomic level) to cost significantly more than 100x. 

Finally, when one says 10x increase in precision typically is accompanied by a 100 times increase in cost, is this 100x the previous ""level of cost"" (P n = Pn-1 + 0.1C, where P = time precision, n = the nth increment) or 100x the original cost (P = 0.1C)?

57,Residential closed loop solar heating system question.,1424615161,"I'm a newspaper reporter, so my only skill in this arena is asking questions. My solar system is backed up by propane. During the recent storm the propane ran out and when this happens the system kind of poops itself, which is my fault. However, in the course of repairing it I made a discovery, and wonder if this is the way the system is intended to work, a workaround, or only something that seems like a good idea because I'm a knuckle dragging troglodyte. To my mind, this reads as an engineering problem but I apologize if I'm mistaken.

So, glycol circulates from a collector on the roof down to tanks in the basement, this glycol heats water in tanks that circulates through the baseboard and supplies domestic hot water. If the temperature of the collector exceeds that of the tank, I am told the heat is free. If the temperature of the collector is below that of the tank, the propane is supposed to kick in and bring it up to temp.

A small circulator pump ~1 hp or so provides the thrust. The pump is fed electric through the control panel and to this point has run intermittently on orders from the control panel. In the past I've had disagreements with the pump and the panel on when the bastard should be on. Sometimes it doesn't kick in and the heat remains trapped in the collector loop, eventually but not immediately triggering relief valves if the pressure gets too high coating my basement in a layer of expressed glycol. This has happened once. 

So a few days ago the pump wasn't working and the roof was heating up to about 250 F and the house was still freezing. The heat was trapped in the collector loop and not warming the tanks, which were stuck at about 80 F (this is low because my dumb ass let the propane run out leading to one cold night). The circulator pump wasn't running. I disconnected (with mild prejudice) the pump from the control panel and patched it to a plug and plugged that bastard in, bringing it to life. I cranked it to ""high"" and eventually equalized the temperatures. 
As I was paranoid about the whole deal I kept checking my temps for the rest of the night. Now this is where it gets interesting to me. At 10 pm or so the collector was about 130 F, which is completely insane as it was cold as hell and also dark. At around midnight it was reading 145F or so. It gained heat, presumably by the mixing/pumping motion of the circulator pump (best guess)? The tanks were a steady 130, so it wasn't drawing heat from one to feed the other. 
Sorry about all the prologue. The system came with the house and I'm learning it as I go, I only have the dude who installed it to go on and while he seems competent I don't know enough to to challenge him. My question is this: **What, if any, disadvantage is there to running that bastard pump all the time? Is the increase in house electric enough to offset the bastard expensive propane use that I hate, is inconvenient and expensive?**   ",AskEngineers,mostlyjustgames,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2wrewy/residential_closed_loop_solar_heating_system/

My first semester I took 3 courses, and a TA position, and second semester I did another course, a TA, and worked in the lab a lot to get data. TA positions are a 10 hour per week job, but really its more like 4 or 5 at max. Grad courses were pretty easy as well (structural engineering courses).

None seem interested.  None of them have called me with questions and none have submitted any bids.
My starting quantity is 300 desks.  I know it's not huge, but a guy has to start somewhere, right?  My plan is to re-invest 100% of the profit back into more orders so that I can continue to place larger orders and lower my costs.

81,Oil Refining Process Questions,1424490446,"Hey Everyone,

I'm working on the trading floor of a midstream oil &amp; gas company right now (dealing with LPG's specifically) and I want to get more acquainted with the processes that take place within Oil Refineries. I'm finding that it's a lot easier for me to understand the markets when I know a little bit more about what's actually happening at Oil Refineries and why there's suddenly more supply or demand of certain products when certain units are brought up or brought down. With that said, I'm not completely foreign to how refineries operate. I've done some pretty good research into the main processes and units but I still feel that I want to know more. I've got a list of questions below that I've separated out by each unit/process at the refinery. If you can shed any light on my questions or correct any wrong thoughts I have I'm all ears! Even if you've got some information that's tangent to one of the questions and not completely relevant I will still welcome it with open arms! I'm not looking for specifics on any one refinery, just information in general (if that's possible):

**Distillation Processes**

- Does a typical complex refinery have more than one main crude unit? If so, how many might a refinery have? I'm not talking about fractionation columns in conjunction with other units, just the main one(s) at the beginning of the refining process
- How much tolerance is there in terms of being able to change cut points on the crude unit? I realize that this depends on geographical location as well as the capabilities of the refinery, but let's assume that we're talking about a refinery that's got all the bells and whistles
- What options do refiners have if the crude unit goes offline? Would this severely restrict the refinery from operating? How can a refiner overcome a problem like this?

**Reforming Processes**

- I know there's multiple purposes for catalytic reformers, but I'm still not entirely sure how the unit operates. Are the conversions accomplished over several different reactors that are collectively referred to as the ""catalytic reformer""? Is there really just one reformer that can accomplish multiple conversions?
- How many different catalysts might be used in a reformer? I know that in the isomerization reactions expensive catalysts like Platinum or Rhenium are used. How are those protected from getting degraded? Don't the C6+ portions of the feed to the reformer destroy those catalysts?
- What type of flexibility can the reformers have? How heavy can the feedstocks to a reformer get before they have to be processed elsewhere? C8? C9+?

**Fluid Catalytic Cracking**

- How big can FCC units get? I know that they're significant proportions of the total capacity of the refinery but what's the max capacity for them relative to the throughput of the refinery? Will the size be dependent on whether or not a refinery is optimized to produce gasoline or a different product?
- What happens when the FCC goes down? I'm struggling to see how a refinery can still operate efficiently without the use of their FCC

**Alkylation**

- What's the optimal ratio for olefins to iso-butane in the reactor? I know this will depend on the type of unit but is there a general guideline to this?
- Does either an HF Alky or SA Alky perform better when using certain combinations of butylenes and propylenes?
- What happens to alkylation if the FCC is not in operation? How are olefin feedstocks acquired?

**Coking**

- I'm still not quite sure why coking exists. Is the reason for coking to produce more light end products? Or does coking exist for the purpose of being able to sell the heaviest ends for more? Both?
- If the FCC unit goes down can the coker serve somewhat as a substitute unit? Since coking is just severe thermal cracking are some of the same results achieved? Or is too much cracking achieved?

Like I said earlier, I will definitely have more questions the more we dive into these topics, so these are just some starter questions to get this discussion going.

For example, I have an excel sheet where I keep track of assigned projects; after 2 months I have 15 that are already ""late"" (most of these are fairly minor, but I just haven't had time to work on/have been told to stop). The reason for this is that management constantly gets new ideas into their heads and demand that they become top priority, which means I never get a chance to finish some things. It also tends to mean that the easiest things get done, while tough/poorly posed problems sit until the last minute, at which point they're solved poorly, based on what I've seen in designs other engineers in my team have done.

I thought it would be cool to make a calculator which you enter the numbers, not with buttons, but with an old telephone rotary dial.


I've [read up on rotary dials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_dial) and they're pretty simple: it pulses current at a fixed frequency for an amount of time which is longer the further the dial was turned. So the number dialled can be recognised by how many pulses there are.


What I need (and what's beyond my abilities) is a piece of circuitry ideally with cheap and easy components, that can process the input of some number of pulses before a pause, and give an output of either 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 that can then go into a simple calculator circuit which I'm sure I can take care of myself. Presumably there's a bit of leeway on each number also, so the system would need to catch within certain ranges of number of pulses.


I hope I've described what I mean well enough. Grateful for any help on this!

So the the joists that hold up the floor are 2x8s (actual size ~1 1/2""x7 1/4""), and are spaced 24"" inches apart.  There's also a central beam (~5 1/2"" x 8"") held up with a post that these joists run parallel to.  The span from outside wall to this main beam is approximately 12 feet.

The aquarium I'm looking at is 120 gallon, with a stand with a footprint of 60""x18"".  An approximate guess for total load would be ~1400 lbs.

54,Magnets vs Steel,1424258004,"This is regarding shim stock material for an electric motor. It would only be around .005-.015"" thick. The magnets are generic ferrite and not all that strong, maybe 800-1000 gauss.

Question - What type of steel will block or hold the magnetism into the can best? I'm assuming it would be between high and low carbon? Is there some other exotic type that would hold better?

55,French engineer : I just got my green card and have a few questions for those of you working in the US.,1424257986,"So as I am trying to make the move to the US, I have a few questions. I was sent here by /r/jobs and hope you can help me with some things.

&amp;nbsp;

First, here is a little more about my situation:

I am a German living in France and my wife is American, and that's why I was able to get a green card. I now have 6 months to move to the US, but before doing so, I want a job there.

I just graduated from a very good engineering school in France. I have a Master of Engineering in mechanics and polymer processing. I did a 3 year Co-Op program going to school and working half tie in R&amp;D at a 100k+ employee multinational (which is my main working experience so far). I am also Fluent in French, German and English with some bits of Spanish.

&amp;nbsp;

So here some of my questions:

- What kind of salary should I ask for? It seems very hard to find numbers for College grad salaries, I find glassdoor is not much help. (If that matters, we are trying to go to NC)

- The only CAD experience I have is on CATIA &gt; SolidWorks &gt; SolidEdge, and I see a lot of job postings asking for Unigraphics (Siemens) or ProEng experience. I guess my question is, how relevant is my CAD experience? Is CATIA (and the other Dassault system tools) not used so much in the US?

- I might be getting a bit ahead of myself, but I have the impression things are a bit more formal in the US. Especially in an industrial environment is a suit really recommended for interviews? I am not a suit guy, and here in France I'd probably wear jeans and a shirt and few would see anything wrong with that. What about the US?

- For people that have worked in Europe and the US, what would you say are the biggest differences between what is expected of an engineer here and there? I know about the almost inexistent vacation days, no need to remind me of that... but what else? Also, what are the biggest differences in the recruitment process or work contracts that I should be aware of?

- When I see job offers for entry-level positions, with a list of 15 almost unrelated qualification requirements... how serious do I have to take those? Do companies realize that nobody studied chemistry, electronics and material science all at once (while having 5 years of experience and applying for an entry-level position :-| ), and I can apply if I meet only half the requirements listed, or would I just waste my time (and are HR in the US crazy)?

**Edit (you guys reminded me I forgot one question):** 

- I hear a lot about bots scanning through resumes and cover letters, and that only .docx files can be read. Everyone here uses .pdf so there are no formatting issues. Should I send .docx resumes?

**Edit 2 (sorry... remembered another one):** 

- In France, you will occasionally be asked for a reference from your last job, but mostly to check weather you actually worked there than anything else. I have the impression it's more than that in the US, so do I have to give my last direct superior for information about my performance, or do I give that of the coworkers that will be the most flattering about me, or just anyone that will confirm I worked there?

Okay, that should really be it. Sorry Some of this might seem trivial, but I've spent years preparing for the job market here, and now I question everything...

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you all for taking the time to reply, ~~if~~ when I make the move and get a job in the US I will update.

59,Worth looking into getting a custom power cord made?,1424223595,"I'm designing a [compact computer case](http://imgur.com/a/YcaDO) and due to the layout it uses an internal power cord to route from the back of the case to the PSU AC inlet. I'm wanting to reduce the distance between the PSU and the top panel but that requires a low profile angled C13 plug.

An up-angle plug would be ideal, it would provide the best compatibility with the currently available SFX/SFX-L PSUs since the AC inlet location is not standardized, but I've scoured Alibaba and the like and have not run into one.

Tolerancing the holes to the pin is no problem but my question is regarding the location of the holes. I typically don't tolerance the location any tighter than +-.0005"" figuring they won't do much better than that anyhow.

Started out in the Navy in 1994 as a Fire Control Technician, basically maintaining and operating electronic systems and computers used to launch tomahawk missiles and torpedoes from submarines.  I also worked on hydraulic and pneumatic control systems.  

When I got out in 2008 I worked as a security systems integrator (access controls, intrusion detection systems, CCTV) for a DoD contractor and Amazon. Wound up getting hurt in a car accident and lost the job with Amazon after 3 months as a result.  

In between those two jobs I was recalled to active duty as an IED Analyst, basically I reversed engineered IED circuitry for 12 months and helped develop jamming systems. 

Took a year off for personnel reasons, then took a job as a Project manager supervising a crew of 45 performing instrumentation and control system upgrades to engine rooms and weapon control systems on Navy Ships. Got laid off after the terms of our contract changed following the government shutdown. 

For the last year, before getting laid off, I worked in the oil fields troubleshooting, repairing, and doing maintenance on electronic and PLC controled systems. I primarily worked with Siemens Simatic 7 PLC's and HMI's. I also performed field calibration of equipment including loop checks and PID tuning on flow and pressure control systems. 

I never have had to really look for a job in an area where I don't know a soul. Moving is an option, but everywhere I look employees want I&amp;C techs to be electricians or have a college degree. 

Any advice or areas I should be looking?

Another suggestion is to just add a piece of 3/4"" plywood on the top to distribute the weight more evenly.  The only issue with this would be that I would have to cut four 3-inch holes in the bottom of the plywood to allow for the tank plumbing (which comes out of the bottom of the tank).

What I dont understand: if you're going to go to the trouble to make the mold to make the pattern, why not just make 10 molds (expensive) and pour directly into the molds? I would think the upfront investment of a more robust, precise mold gives a better finished product, and is a wash if you consider that you can skip the substrate.",AskEngineers,No_Kids_for_Dads,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2w5mq3/why_is_investment_casting_a_thing/

92,Biomedical Engineer in a Software Engineering Role at a Defense Contractor,1424139809,"(Already posted in r/cscareerquestions)
Hey guys, so I'm a biomedical engineering masters student who got an offer at one of the big name defense contractors as a software engineer. I have seen a lot of the opinions on defense contractors here, but I wanted to ask some more specific questions.

I have only taken about 2 computer science related classes in my college career, so most of my experience with software comes from research and individual projects (i.e. I don't have a lot of experience). However, I really enjoy the field and have been applying to related jobs, this opportunity is one of the only ones I heard back from so far. What I essentially want to know is can I easily transition to another industry after getting ample experience in the defense industry? Does having the name of one of the top 5 defense contractors on my resume look good to people hiring for software engineering roles in other industries, or will it only look good to other defense companies?

I do have the opportunity to work at a small startup as well (&lt;20 people), but if I want to become more attractive and marketable as a software engineer, especially considering my lack of experience, would it be better to work for the defense company?
In regards to salary, they made me an offer that I would consider good, but I want to know how it compares to someone with the formal education related to the position. So what would be a good starting salary for a CS or CE graduate at a large defense company (or for any software development role, really) in the Los Angeles area?

The last question I had has a little bit to do with my own ego and sense of pride. I know for ME's and EE's the top 5 defense companies are highly desirable and sought after, but is it the same for software engineers? Is there any ""wow"" factor associated with working at one of these companies? Sorry if this question is really self-absorbed.

tl;dr - Because of my lack of experience I feel like it would be hard to get my foot in the door in the software field. So, despite the stigma around defense companies, would that industry be a good way for me to get into that career path?",AskEngineers,WhereShouldILive_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2w5ch4/biomedical_engineer_in_a_software_engineering/

99,Technician vs. Engineer,1424117627,"my question is very specific but I would love a general answer too.  any information is always amazing to read.  Thank you so much for your time and thoughts. 

I'll try to unpack this in the least amount of words as possible.  I have a BA.  I was laid off several times in 08-09.  I wanted to work in solar from the beginning but did not believe in my ability to make it in an engineering program.  After experiencing failure after failure I decided, fuckit, I'll give it a shot.  I was accepted into a program that did not have a GPA requirement.  The name of the program or degree is ""Electronics Engineering Technology (Alternative Energy Technology) (BS)"".  I have learned a lot about solar, and fuel cells.  I asked my counselor if this was an engineering degree during my 1st semester and she said it was, that I would not need to attempt to transfer to the EE program. Maybe I should have know better but I didn't.  I'm a senior now and just went to a job fair where every employer said that they would not hire me as an engineer b/c ""that is not an engineering degree"".  They did mention that if I took and passed the FE exam I would be hirable.  I don't like to admit this but I read at a snails pace and consequently fall apart in tests.  I'm terrified I will fail so I think about my future without the FE to move forward.

My forte is seeing the big picture and leading people.  I always find new ways of doing things that don't add a 10% increase but total game changers (which most people get completely turned off by as soon as I start to unravel my ideas).  I do this b/c I fuck up constantly and need to find ways that work for me.  This can, if i'm lucky, lead to really incredible improvements or i look like an idiot b/c it took me so long to do something.

0,Where to start a career with Additive Manufacturing?,1424113220,"Sorry for the long back story. My question is at the end. 
I'm an undergraduate senior and will be graduating this spring with a BS in Mechanical Eng. I discovered an interest in 3D printing and additive manufacturing after attending a nearby city's Advanced Manufacturing Technology Show. Not long after that I did some research on stereolithography for a machining class presentation. Probably the most interested I've been doing a class assignment. An engineer at the company I am interning  at told me how new the field of AM is regarding Design for Manufacturing and Finite Element Analysis. I want to get on board with this technology. 

I've been reading articles here and there on AM and 3D printing news. But I haven't been doing as much as I like due to other priorities. I've thought about buying my own desktop 3D printer. But being a poor college student and with the speed technology is changing, I don't know if it's worth it.

NOW TO MY QUESTION...
What kind of AM jobs are out there that will take someone right out of school with little to no experience with AM? It doesn't sound too likely. Should I look to enroll in a program/degree that is more AM focused before trying to enter the field?

12,Need Help Understanding Volume of Compressed Gas Inside a Tank,1424065253,"Hello,

I'm trying to figure out how much volume the gas would take up if the tank were opened. I'm not an engineer so please forgive me if there is something out of place or non standard. I'm making a simulation and I have the size of the tank and how much pressure it holds but do not know how much gas can fit inside until I use this.

The room is at 1 atm and 0 C (STP) and there is a tank which holds 1000 L of gas. The pressure inside the tank is 2500 psi (170.11491 atm) and is at the same temperature as the room. Using the Ideal Gas Law to determine the number of moles inside the tank I get:


n = PV / RT where R has the units L atm K^-1 mol^-1

n = (170.11491 atm * 1000 L) / (0.08205736 * 273.15 K)

n = 7589.682954 mol


The tank is labeled argon which has an atomic mass of 39.948 (http://www.convertunits.com/molarmass/argon). Now I know the mass of the gas inside which is 303192.654646 g (7589.682954 * 39.948) (~303 Kg).

This time we are calculating the volume:


V = nRT / P where R has the units L atm K^-1 mol^-1

V = (7589.682954 mol * 0.08205736 * 273.15 K) / 1 atm

V = 170114.909980 L (~170 m^3)


I think earlier I had my units in cubic meters instead of liters for the volume in the mol calculation and I was getting really small numbers for the volume of the gas released.

13,How to mount a vertical shaft for an anemometer?,1424062740,"Hello, I'd like to create a digital anemometer ([cup type](http://www.calibrate.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cup-anemometer.jpg)). I'm building a single one, for home/hobbyist use and have access to all the machining tools (metal lathes etc) that may be required. I am an electronics student, so I don't quite know the proper terms for some of the mechanical engineering concepts.

For my design, I will need to mount a vertical shaft that should be able to rotate with extremely low rolling resistance. There will not be much load on the shaft in any direction, as the cups will be balanced and lightweight.

The shaft will need to have a disc halfway up (to mount a magnet for the reed switch / hall effect sensor for the RPM measurement). The cups will be mounted at the top of the shaft. [Here's an old design I created](http://i.imgur.com/J41B3A7.jpg?1) - I have since realised that it would be best for the cups to be on the top instead of hanging below, for structural and airflow reasons. This creates the issue that it will be more complex to mount the shaft as there will need to be an end point support.

I understand that there should be a bearing in the top of the case to hold the shaft in place while allowing rotation, but how would I mount the bottom end of the shaft? All the bearings I can find have a hole going straight through them, instead of being an 'end piece'.

19,Why does my boiler heated apartment get so hot on warm winter days?,1424050552,"I live in Canada, much of my life in older, boiler heated apartments. My mother raised me a good Canadian, if you're cold: put on a sweater. I always leave my thermostat down as far as it will go, and my apt temperature hovers between 17-21°C most of the year, except in the mid-summer, and a day or two after a winter warm spell. My question is why does my apartment temperature skyrocket up past 24°C when a winter warm spell happens? The temperature outside is still below 10°C, and the sun doesn't heat my place up like that when it is 10°C in September or May. 

I have a theory and it goes like this: my neighbours all feel like if they don't pay for heat, they might as well turn the thermostat up to summertime in Bahamas temperatures when its cold outside. Maybe to pretend they don't live in Canada. Then when the temps outside aren't as cold, the extreme heat in their apartment starts to feel a little bit like overkill and everyone else turns down their thermostats too. Meanwhile the building's boiler is used to this huge load trying to keep everyone's apartments at 27°C when it is -27°C outside, suddenly everyone's thermostat says they only want 17°C, and it only has 5°C air outside to regulate it.

My idea would be to use heater blankets on both sides with heat flux sensors on both sides of the material.  The heater blankets would then be controlled such that their applied heat flux mimics the heat flux that would be seen under the convective airflow.  My idea would use the simple relation of Heat Flux = Conv. Coeff * deltaT [Qdot = h*(T2-T1)] to control he heater blanket to supply the proper heat flux as a function of the surface temperature. 

I guess my specific questions would be: 

 
* Is there any particular issue with using this approach?  
* Are there heater blankets that can be controlled in such a manner to supply the proper heat flux?  
* Is there another heat supply system I should be considering? (Radiant heater?)

I made a diagram though it doesn't show anything extra from the above:

27,Dilemma over civil engineering prospects,1424028352,"Hi, I am a 2nd year CivE and I don't know if I should switch disciplines. I originally chose civil because I had quite a bit of construction experience, it looked for field-based, had more of a project management side, and I have a goal of starting a construction company later on. I didn't go into engineering for the very technical side, but I know I want to be an engineer as I like the responsibility of the job. I'm gonna be honest and say that I am highly motivated by money and I feel that there are better options in terms of salary with other disciplines. I live in Alberta, very close to the oil sands and I feel that if I don't get a job there, then it's a huge missed opportunity due to the big money there. Do civil engineers get hired by the oil and gas industry? Also, my school offers mining and petroleum engineering that I am now considering. Am I better off doing mechanical so that I can work in the oil sands but also have the ability to change industries?

28,What is it like to be an engineer? / Is being good at this easy high school class indicative of anything?,1424028118,"I don't know if this is the best place to ask, but I'm in my second year of engineering classes at my high school. The first year was all drawing figures in oblique and isometric on paper. At one point we made a puzzle cube thing out of smaller wooden cubes glued together. This year, we got computers and have been using Autodesk Inventor Pro to make parts for different things- a button maker, a scooter, a toy train. We get packets that have all the dimensions and designs already there, although sometimes we have to make up a screw or something ourselves because the teacher's a cheapskate and downloads the packets from a textbook pdf so sometimes they're missing several parts.

Anyway, he's always telling me how good I am at the class. I have a 100% this year for both marking periods. This is not a hard class and I don't trust his opinion to be perfectly honest. Am I actually learning important skills that I could use later?

I ask because my plan for college is to learn enough about the things I'm interested in in the first year or so to decide what I want to do (hopefully by like sophomore year?). I am currently leaning heavily towards a linguistics major. Not computer linguistics. Linguistics linguistics. So you see, going somewhere with that option necessarily narrows down what I can study in terms of engineering. I also have to choose a math class for my high school senior year. Right now, I'm in regular Pre-Calculus and I'm going for AP Statistics. My other option would be Calculus, which I don't need that much if I want to go into linguistics. But what if I could actually be an engineer? I have very little exposure to the math and stuff around it, but maybe if I learned more I would actually love it? I really like math but I don't test as well as I do with reading... (660 Math, 800 Reading and 720 Writing in the December SAT I took)

idk, just some info on what being an engineer is actually like would be great! I am NOT asking for you guys to choose my major (that would be against the rules!) I am just asking if what I'm learning has any basis in Actual Engineering. Does that make sense? Please! 

EDIT: For the people encouraging me not to give up despite the shortcomings of my class, that's very sweet and I appreciate the support but I'm just asking to know more about the context of what I know, in terms of the ~real world~, you know?

I'm finally getting to the point where I actually know what I'm talking about and have fostered a pretty good relationship with those that I work with and people tend to trust my analysis of things and when they're not convinced, they at least hear me out.

This has lead to a change in my attitude in general. I've gotten used to the fact that when I speak, I'm heard. If someone disagrees, I can explain my point thoroughly and address concerns. It's made me much more effective as an engineer, because I have authority in my voice which makes people feel confident that if they do what I say, even if it doesn't work out, their ass is covered, because I'm standing behind my words.

However, this has caused a noticeable decay in my relationship with my parents, extended family, and old friends. Those that I see every day are used to this and don't seem to have any problem with my behavior. It's most noticeable with my parents, because we used to get along quite well.

52,Academics vs GRUNTS,1423857014,"Hi engineers this is a x-post r/electricians

I'm seeking critique, feedback, and advice on improving myself on the electrical industry and I think it's a good topic.  Every electrician foreman loves to gripe about an engineer at some point.

GRUNTS vs Academics

Hi, I just joined.  I'm a younger guy working in the electricity and construction field for 7+ years.

My Dad is an electrician turned Senior project manager for an EMCOR contractor Wasatch Electric managing the ATT contract and building 100s of cell phone sites. 
My Grandpa is an WWII artillery vet turned electrician. And my Uncle is an electrician. 

My current job (almost 2 years) has been working in utilty control panels and systems for a business that has a contract for Pacificorp control panels and additional power companys that need substation panels.

With that said, I have been layed off for two weeks and expect to go back next week.  This time off has given me a chance to think about how can I move up/ahead in this field?  I was looking at the University of Utah's Electrical Engineering program and courses.  Basically my reaction was dammmmm, look at all those math, calculus, physics, even quantum theory courses.  Going up to atleast Calculus III.

If you're successful at becoming an engineer and lucky enough to find a job as one STILL are you not pretty much relegated to an office sentence?  I worked in the electrical contractor office for years and I feel like your job is going to be an office sentence; serving at your desk, like a rat in your cage.

I love working with wire, field work, fabricating, and crimping.  Electrical control wiring is an art just like someone who uses their hands to mold clay into a vase.  I somehow get a lot of satisfaction out of a nearly % 100 or completely % 100 perfect panel, no crossed wires, all straight lines.

So to sum up, if I were to pursue the electronic automation and instrumentation courses at the Salt Lake community college technical school YES I would be improving my abilities to receive hire wages BUT STILL there is a glass ceiling.  Instrumentation technicians median income is about $24-$26 and 90 percentile income is $38.

I find it very disturbing that ""academic types"" ""college educated"" people continue to look down on trade workers.  We are the GRUNTS, ""oh that's grunt work"".  Even a low voltage tech foreman will look down on the support techs labeling them grunts.

What do you guys think about pursuing an electrical engineering degree?  I'd like to figure out the pros/cons of a EE degree, or starting at the beginning of the Apprenticeship,  and lastly continuing in control panels while taking instrumentation/automation and the other basic electricity courses to improve myself.

Thanks! And remember ""green to ground makes the earth go round"" geez that's cheesy.

54,Can a VA resident take the IL PE exam?,1423853153,"Hello all,

[It's my understanding that Illinois (and some other states) allows candidates to sit for the PE exam prior to completing their 4 years of residency under a licensed PE](https://www.continentaltesting.net/CTSonlineapp/Downloads/2014%20Online%20PE%20Instructions.pdf).  The title ""PE, pending experience"" is awarded and for all intents and purposes, they function as an EIT.

While I was attending school in Illinois, many of the engineers in the office highly recommended that I take the PE exam as soon as possible while the college knowledge is still fresh in my mind.

Fast forward a few years and I'm now living in Virginia.  I thought I had to sit for the VA PE exam (VA makes candidates wait the full four years prior to taking the exam), but a professor today suggested that I just take the IL exam.

I didn't know that was possible and I'm having no luck finding PE residency requirements.  Can someone please confirm that out-of-state residents can take a different state's PE exam?

Additionally, are there any issues with working in one state as an engineer while earning the PE license from a different state?

Thanks

EDIT:  I found this a while later on the Nevada PE site, another early-test state:  ""Be aware if you complete the exam early you will qualify for licensing in Nevada, but some states may require more time between the exams and may not accept your exam for licensing in their state.  If you are planning for professional licensing in other states, you should check their requirements before taking the exam early so you won’t be required to retake the exam.""  Boy, it would suck to have to retake the PE exam.

It seems so strange to me that this is an issue.  I thought part of the reason for the NCEES was comity among states.  If some states don't allow other states' licensure, then it could become a real headache to figure out in which states a PE can stamp plans!  Ugh

I understand the parameters, and where they come from, but the only examples I've seen of this equation being used are for a rectangular shaped PCB simply supported (1 rotational DoF only) along each of the 4 edges.  But that is not how 99% of PCB's are designed (in fact, I don't think I've ever seen a 4-edge simply supported PCB in my life.  1 or 2 edge fixed support, sure, but never 4 and never simply supported).

What about irregular shapes?  Or, the much more common cases of being supported by irregularly placed screws, or even just a screw in each corner?  None of this seems to be addressed in any explanation I can find, and I have no idea how valid this equation is for those more common cases, and how to choose the values of the parameters.

Has anyone used this equation (or another for calculating the maximum deflection or curvature of a PCB under load) and have some insight?

I'm currently trying to improve our PCB analysis methods.  My idea is to run the PCB through a FEA modal analysis, find the mode shapes with the highest mass participations, and scale and superimpose them to get a general, white noise vibration shape that's scaled from 0 to 1.  Then from there, I can calculate the curvature of the PCB and use the principles and data from the above equation's origin to determine where the board might be bending too much too quickly and components are at risk of popping off.

EDIT: Simulation of the individual components is not an option; there are far too many, and they are far too small.  It would take me weeks to build the model, and the element sizes would be so small that the sim would take another several weeks to run (assuming it didn't crash my computer first).",AskEngineers,killerguppy101,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2vsc8g/derivation_of_steinbergs_maximum_deflection/

58,Being slotted into one particular engineering career path upon graduation - is the danger real or am I just imagining it?,1423823320,"I really want to work in product and system development working with low-level software and electronics. I've interviewed for such position at one company but unfortunately it was a 'no' from them. However, they said it wasn't an easy decision (essentially one of 4 interviewers blocked me), and offered me an interview with their wireless products software division.

Now, I don't really want to work with software forever, and certainly not in the world of dealing with wireless communication protocols etc. I just don't find that interesting. I already hold one offer from another company that's a software position, but not restrained to wireless stuff (but the company is much less favourable - long hours, etc). I find myself sad and disappointed now, even despite the offers I hold, because in my mind, once after graduation I go into pure software dev, it will be hard for me to go back to lower-level products/systems design. How real is this fear? Is it a thing? Is choosing my first job path as critical as I imagine it to be?

65,How does the FORTIS Exoskeleton work?,1423794236,"Ok, I'm not an engineer and I have been waiting on an answer for this for 4 days now, since someone else asked it to no avail. So failing that maybe someone can tell me if I am understanding it correctly.

So in my layman perceptions and understanding of the FORTIS is the weight is bared by the structure and transferred via the feet or knees on the frame. Using [this picture](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/mfc/photo/exoskeleton/mfc-fortis-photo07-h.jpg) as a reference we can see that the shoulder harness is not tight against the body, so the weight is not supported via the harness. The weight transfers through the frame to the floor, in this case the knee on the left, and foot on the right. The harness, feet and leg straps only serve as points the FORTIS attaches for movement and stability purposes. In [this picture](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/mfc/photo/exoskeleton/mfc-fortis-photo02-h.jpg) we have the FORTIS standing upright with the feet on the ground, and see the foot straps don't sit on the ground and are raised a little bit. This is so the frame feet are always firmly planted on the ground so there is minimal weight being moved by the operator. Likewise in the first picture the left knee can be seen sitting further back than the frame knee so once again the frame is on ground before the operator. The frame is rigid and hold the weight by being the path to the ground while the operator moves without feeling the weight since the straps only serve to secure the frame to them, not support the weight.

Kinda cool to look at something seemingly so simple like you could build one yourself and realize how much there must be that isn't seen in how it was made and designed.

I ask this question as I am finally getting something of a grasp on modern display technologies, but I'm left with this little conundrum: from what I've see it looks as though IPS displays utilize two advantages over TN panels: sharper color response by using a single plane for it's electrode configuration (which I assume both deepens the blacks and allows for more precise switching for higher color depth), and what appears to be a chevron-based pixel pattern for increased viewing angles (which is making some sense to me but I'm still trying to break-down to fully understand the reason.) Assuming the idea that the chevrons are what enable this wide viewing cone which is what I'm gathering from my research, what is keeping this pixel configuration from being adapted to TN displays to increase their own viewing cone? I'm approaching this question with the assumption that I either have a misunderstanding about what allows IPS panels to have a wide viewing cone, or that there is a specific obstacle keeping this technique from being applied to TN panels, but my searches haven't yielded many useful results; I might be asking Google something in poor language or too specific or something, but I can't seem to word this question laconically enough.",AskEngineers,Berkut99,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2vmt0u/why_cant_twistednematic_lcd_displays_use_a/

When you think of a crane you think of it as a relatively simple machine it just picks up objects and moves them around by rotating or extending the boom. Other than how much power it requires to move these big pieces of machinery what makes the circuitry so complex?

My friend was saying that one thing was that if you want to rotate the crane x degrees in one direction, it isn't so simple because (without the circuitry) you would overshoot it and then when you try to correct it, you move it back and over shoot it again. He said the circuits use differential equation mathematics to calculate and make this process work so you don't overshoot. 

Another side question:
He also mentioned that a crane knows the weight of an object right when it picks it up. How does it determine this information?",AskEngineers,KingOfWuju,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2vlup4/why_does_a_crane_require_so_much_circuitry/

I thought someone here might be able to help me with a bit of a conundrum I am having. (PS, If this is the wrong sub please delete this post).

I am trying to make a super accurate and detailed 3D model of a Panzer IV from World War II. I have a schematic showing the steering brake system and how it is connected to the steering lever, but I don't know how the darn thing goes together.

Would anyone mind [looking at this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3bxcdqt67amwu4i/brakes.jpg?dl=0) and seeing if they can help me see what the heck is going on here?",AskEngineers,Gewehr98,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2vlb3r/braking_system_of_ww2_german_tank/
95,Calculating the resonant frequency of laminated safety glass.,1423695809,"Hi all,

I'm not an engineer, I'm just some scrub with an idea.  I've had this idea for quite some time, but I'll happily accept if I'm wrong.  


If I'm right I think I could make driving in the rain safer.  Increasing driver visibility over traditional windshield wipers.

______________________

Water doesn't stick to vibrating glass.  I would like to use a motor or a speaker (operating at the windshield's resonant frequency) to shake the windshield.  
____________________________
So long as the sound is outside the range of human hearing, and the vibration is outside the range of human vision, and it doesn't compromise the integrity of the windshield - I think my idea has some merit.

99,Power monitoring equipment,1423684188,"This might not be the right place to post this, so suggestion for other places are welcome. 

I'm looking for a power monitor that optimally would be a plug load monitor. The goal would be to monitor both voltage and current at a time resolution of 1000 Hz ~~1000 kHz~~, which would be 20 samples per cycle (for 50 Hz). 

I'm aware of devices like the HOBO plug load logger, and WattsUp, but as far as I know their time resolution is only 1 Hz. 

An added benefit is also if I can communicate with the logger and get data out if over Serial or USB protocols (as apposed to a proprietary software).

Any ideas or suggestions here are greatly welcomed.
