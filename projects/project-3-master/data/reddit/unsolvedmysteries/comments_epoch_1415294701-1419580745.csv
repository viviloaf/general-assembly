0,Question about a concrete foundation for a light post to be used for a WISP PTP antenna,1419567467,"Hi Engineers, I live in a rural area with one crappy landline ISP, and too many trees to get hooked up with a reliable signal on a LoS wireless carrier. I recently found out that one of the companies could put their antenna up with a bucket truck possibly up to 35' Off the ground using an old light post we had lying on our property, problem is I have to get the thing anchored in the ground so that it wont move. The pole is currently 20' in height, made mostly of 1/8"" steel, with a base ~10"" across with 1"" anchoring mount holes, made out of 1/2"" steel. the pole is square from the bottom and tapers until 6"" from the top, where it has a ~2"" circular tube of 1/4"" steel.   The pole weighs about 250Lbs (this is a guess, it can be moved/dragged by one person and carried by two, I really have no way of weighing it) Ive found that I probably need a footing with a minimum diameter/size of 18"" across, and should use 3/4"" minimum but 7/8"" recommended size J/L anchor bolts for it. Since the pole could possibly end up being 35' feet high with an extension, and a PTP wireless dish attached to it, it will of course leverage a wind load against its foundation. 

I need to know how deep the concrete base should be with  a 2' diameter hole, and assuming I cant quite get that deep, what the best way to secure the anchor would be (we have nearly solid basalt bedrock 3-5' down in the ground in the location the pole needs to go), such as drilling and anchoring rebar in the rock. thank you",AskEngineers,Nemesis158,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2qf3e0/question_about_a_concrete_foundation_for_a_light/
1,What is your experience as an Engineer in Construction Management like? Career advice appreciated.,1419561016,"I am in need of some career guidance advice. This is my second post about career guidance in reddit/engineering. 

I am looking to switch jobs in about 6 months or so, this summer. I would have been with my current employer for 19-20 months at this point. I am a mechanical engineer working in construction management. I do lots of fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer calculations to size equipment such as pumps, boilers, tanks, pipes, control valves, chillers, cooling towers, etc for factories. Although tedious at times, I do enjoy this type of work and do find construction management rewarding. 

The reason I am looking to change jobs, or career advice per say is the work atmosphere I am in. Seeing as I am 24 years old, I do not have much to compare my current situation to, so I came to reddit for advice. Some issues I see with my current employer and other engineer's my age are

1. The lack of training, mentoring, and review of work. This leads to disasters in the field (incomplete scope of works, millions of dollars wasted, etc).

2. Our company is about 300 people in size, 75% of which are engineers or architects. The company structure is flat. Upper management (the owners of the company) are out of touch with the engineers. There is no leadership or structure to advance or grow, no annual performance reviews. Performance bonus's are entirely political.

3. New engineers work the most hours. I've averaged 60 hours per week all year long and earned $70K this year and to weeks vacation. This is the norm for other engineers my age and in similar roles. I'm not sure if we're underpaid or overworked, but most engineers my age quit around the 18-24 month mark and move on. Meanwhile, the company owners put in 45 hours per week.

4. The work atmosphere can be toxic. I've sen coworkers torn down to shreds in meetings in front of 10 other people, on the verge of tears, people being told they suck, etc. I've been screamed at myself for not getting work done properly that I was never told to do or trained to do. 

I hate to bitch about my situation, I am grateful to be employed and to be doing great things with my education and skills. I would just like some feedback on my work situation (is this normal, common, etc?) And would other mechanical engineering careers in construction management be similar to the one I am in now? Essentially, I am looking to do the same job I do now in a different, more structured atmosphere with better advancement opportunities.

3,[Mechanical] Question about hydraulic hammers.,1419551400,"I'm interested in making a handheld hydraulic hammer whose sole purpose is breaking off pieces of rock. The problem is I'm not sure how hydraulic hammers work or how to begin making one. I've tried looking it up, but I can't seem to find a good explanation that I understand (I have no experience with hydraulic machines in general). 

So, my questions are:

1) What does the hydraulic system even do? My initial thought is that the hammer bit is attached to a spring, which rises with the piston. Then the system is unloaded and the bit falls down and breaks whatever is underneath.

2) This system has to be pretty light, and is not required to be very powerful. Would I have to fabricate my own pump, or would I be able to buy a smaller, weaker one? Do I even have to use a pump?

4,How do I manage the expectations of clients &amp; managers?,1419550737,"On the job, I’m usually given fairly complicated projects, because I’ve shown a mastery of the material in the past.  Unfortunately, the people giving me these projects (whether they are managers or clients), have not had the same mastery, and generally have a background that is completely different.  They come to me to get the job done, and in the beginning they’ll ask for my opinion, a cost estimate, and a timeframe - which I will give them.

Some of these people are reasonable – they have good instincts of what kind of work is involved and what the risks are.  I’m noticing however, that most of them do not have these instincts – and I am getting incredibly frustrated with them.

They will badger me on what work needs to be done, and they will treat me like I’m selling them a car.  They will expect everything to go 100% right, and when things don’t they’ll marginalize my work, even when things are going 90%.

I could chalk it up to these people specifically being bad clients/managers, but I would be turning down a lot of work if I avoided them.  (Maybe I should be turning them down.)

Edit: More info, 40' High Cube Dry Coten Steel Cargo Container. I'm in the planning process and want to know where/how to make holes in the wall. The most prudent course of action seems sheering up the outside of each container as well as an 'frame' between containers. My standard layout of containers is planned to be 5 containers on top of 5 containers. I was going to crisscross the containers to so the load would be where the two containers intersect and should be sheered up as well due to load bearing. But with the way the shell works on the container I'm unsure of this and the physics behind this shell construction and just learning the vertexes involved in the calculation would be wonderful.

12,Masters degree in engineering possible??,1419468987,"Hey everybody,

I saw a recent post somewhat similar to my situation and it got me thinking a little bit. My question: how feasible would it be for me to pursue a masters in either Mechanical or Aerospace engineering once I get my bachelors?

To give everyone my background, the I am currently a junior in college in the US pursuing a bachelors degree in Engineering Management with a focus in Mechanical Engineering. Technically, it is a business degree with a fair number of courses in the engineering department. The engineering courses that I will take before I graduate include Statics, Strengths of Materials, Thermodynamics, Mechatronics, Differential Equations, a few levels of engineering-based physics, and some others that give me some background with CAD, Matlab, and the machine shop. Additionally, I will participate in at least 1 co-op before I graduate. 

What it be reasonable to transition from Engineering Management to actual Engineering? I'm worried that by not taking most of the upper-level classes required for an actual engineering degree at my school and missing the material covered in those classes, I would be at too much of a disadvantage to pursue a masters. 

If it matters, I've received almost exclusively  A's and B's in my engineering courses, and it would be too late to simply switch my major to engineering because I'd end up being in school for 7 years or so just for my bachelors degree. I'm currently just weighing my options for what to do once I graduate, and I figured this would be a great place to get some honest advice.

52,"Bachelors or MPE? (I have a bachelors in a non-engineering field, basically asking if I should start again)",1419231608,"Hey, so, I need a little career advice. 

The short of it is, I need to know the difference in terms of career prospects between a Bachelors and a Masters (by coursework), keeping in mind I intend to go into biomedical research and development in the long term. I'm in Australia, and already have a bachelors in a soft(ish) science - Genetics

Longer story:

I've just graduated from a double degree - one Bachelor of Arts, one Bachelor of Science. Unfortunately, I don't actually want to continue in either of those fields, I want to be a biomedical engineer. Though any similar engineering field is also a possibility.

I've got the option to apply for a [Master of Professional Engineering](http://sydney.edu.au/courses/programs/master-of-professional-engineering), a Masters program designed for non-engineering graduates who want a career change. It takes 3 years, includes 12 weeks industry placement, and ""has been accorded full accreditation at the level of Professional Engineering by the industry governing body, Engineers Australia"". I'm pretty sure its a proper Masters qualification that would get just as much recognition as any other Master of Engineering. There's also a research option near the end, with a double credit points research elective or a PhD pathway both available if you do well (which I intend to).

Problem is, I've been rejected from this program once due to a weak computing and maths background (my science degree is one of the softer sciences). Current plan: take maths and computing courses for 6mths to a year, and reapply. I'm fairly certain I'd get in at that point, and a professor at the Uni agrees.

The other option, which the same Professor suggested, is to just enrol in a Bachelors, which I could start this year. I don't want to do this, because it feels like I'll have wasted 5 years, and I'll come out with a weaker qualification. I'll get over the first objection, but the second one is more solid. So, can anyone tell me how much difference in terms of career prospects there is between a bachelor of engineering and a Masters (By coursework)?

I'm interested in going into development of new technologies, by the way. Whether I work with a private clinic, hospital, or university doesn't really matter to me, as long as I eventually get to end up designing new stuff. 

Cost of the degree not an issue - we get low interest loans which we don't have to start paying back until our income reaches a certain threshold, should be earning enough to make it more than worthwhile if the average salaries I'm looking at are any indication. 

P.S. Sorry if this counts as a question regarding undergrad degree/major. Was pretty sure it would fall under the graduate degree exception.

So by that logic, if i have machine that generates torque on some wheel, i can calculate force on edges of wheel by dividng torque with distance,so it looks that bigger the radius of wheel is, the smaller the force on the edge. So imagine i have long stick and i want to kick ball with it. It seems to me that ball will go away farther if i hit it with the part of stick that is much farther from me,than when i hit it with middle of stick. But,by expresion force=torque/distance, force should be smaller farther from me than closer to me, so i dont understand why will that happen. If force is smaller at the end of stick, why does it ejects ball farther. Is it because more distant parts of stick are traveling faster than those near center? And if it is, how does force fits equation?

[relevant pictures here](http://imgur.com/a/QqQnx)

The drill in the first two pictures had the handle and switch removed, it works perfectly fine. In the first picture there are two red arrows pointed at two little tabs that butt up against the bit that spins around (for lack of a better word). 

1. Do those have any purpose besides holding the spinney bit in  place?

The motor in the third pic mostly just hums but if I wiggle the spinney bit it'll ""jump"" back a bit then go back to humming.
The motor in the last pic just hums and smokes at me. From that I assume that the spinney bit needs to be sitting in the other bit in a particular place in order to spin.

2. If I build a frame that holds the spinney bit in the proper place (like the one I ripped apart to get the motors out) Would it spin again?

Initially I had a mind to build a miniature lathe and/or belt sander and I think the motor in the first pic would serve that purpose; I just took the other two apart further because I wanted to see how they worked.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2q08kr/im_looking_for_some_clarification_on_how_motors/

The pump is capable of delivering this flow rate at 15 bar, and the pressure drop across the nozzle is only ~2 bar, so my pump can handle it. I'm using an Arduino UNO to sense water flow rate as well as deliver an output voltage to a DC motor controller.

My question is: do I spend the extra time programming a PI controller for this system, or simply develop a curve at constant flow rate for sensor input voltage versus controller output voltage and then obtain an equation with regression analysis?

The pressure inside the vessel doesn't fluctuate quickly, (max is on the order of +/- 5 bar/min) so I don't think that Arduino speed would be much of a hindrance to feedback control, but the empirical method is just so much easier.

I think I've answered my own question here: feedback control is the best solution and I'm being lazy.

The model I am working on has two springs in series. Spring 1's k constant is very small relative to spring 2 (k1&lt;&lt;k2). The bar the springs are mounted to has a rotation point on one side with a motor to store energy in the system. Spring 1 has a strain limiter so as to act as a solid linkage at a long enough length to allow the motor to store a certain amount of energy in spring 2. 

My question is if the motor is suddenly rotated to a lower energy position does energy dissipate from the higher or lower k value first? I believe that the lower energy springs would dissipate first correct?

11,Engineering student fails physics four time,1418858879,"Hello people on Reddit,

I am completely new to this site, however, I have browsed through posts on here quite often lately and decided I would also like to hear all of your responses to my current thoughts.

So, I am currently an undergraduate studying electrical engineering at a smaller university in Texas. My boyfriend is also here, studying environmental engineering. However, he just took physics for the fourth time last semester, and received a D in the class once again. Physics is a major prerequisite for almost all your classes in engineering and the minimum grade you can receive for it to be able to be used for engineering is a C. He is now completely done with all his basics and is just been trying to pass this physics class so he can continue his degree. This is also his 9th semester in college and he is really getting frustrated with the amount of time it is taking him to graduate. Although, he did only go to school part time at a community college while he worked a full time job for the first two years which put him behind on his engineering degree to begin with. In addition, he was planning on dropping out of high school when he was in high school because he just didn't care enough about school. He finally just did what he had to in order to pass his classes and graduate high school, and no more. Then, later down the line after taking classes at a community college he realized that he has a giant passion for helping others and wants to go to school for water purification. Now, he is first generation here in the US and first generation to go to college. Both his parents are from Mexico and didn't go to college so when it comes to the ways of the University they have no clue how to help him. He said that he had huge learning curve up until last semester. He said he was at about at a high school freshman/sophomore level in knowledge before he went to college and that he had no idea how to effectively study until last semester. So, we really thought this would be the semester he passes with a good grade finally since he is now up to par with his background knowledge and know how to effectively study; however, he still received a D.

Now, as for me, I came in with that physics credit from high school, along with a bunch of other credit and just started off straight into physics 2 which I passed with a C. I also fully understand and have a great base in physics. Before you ask, I always try to tutor him, and when I do he understands it completely. It is just that every time he test he almost always gets a D or less. Physics has always come easy to me and so has math. I notice this with most engineering students, that they are usually really strong in their math and science classes. So for him to be struggling to pass this class so much really boggles my mind. I don't know what to do anymore to try and help him pass. I have helped teach how to effectively study completely and even helped him understand problems he didn't before. I hate to see him so frustrated that he hasn't graduated yet, but he says that water purification is the ONLY thing he wants to do in life. He wants to help bring purified water to places that they are dying from the diseases in the water. 

Anyways, sorry for the long excessive story, I guess bottom line is I want to know what you think. 
Has this happened before, where someone attempting to get a degree struggles in passing a class that is the core of that degree? 
Have you ever seen a person fail a class four times, if so, what advise do you have for him?
Also, is there anything I can do to help him? I would just take the test for him, but obviously that is illegal and wouldn't really help him in the end :(",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2pmkwo/engineering_student_fails_physics_four_time/

13,Energy Harvesting Device and Associated Troubles,1418853504,"I am in a third year electrical and mechanical engineering degree and am currently working on a group project to develop an energy harvesting device capable of charging an electronic device with a budget of £100.

The concept has been refined down through many stages from a broad spectrum of thermal, solar and motion down to different types of motion such as piezoelectric generators and electromagnetism and now down to a heel-based device.

We will be aiming to charge an installed 2000mAh battery which could be used to charge a phone via a USB port.

The heel generator is a well-known concept but here is the process:
As user puts fut on ground, heel mechanism pushes up and this mechanism has a rack of teeth. Through a series of gears this connects to a centrifugal switch which in turn spins a toroidal permanent magnet. Magnet induces current in surrounding coils which is conditioned before being used to charge battery.

However the hurdles we have are that we do not know what wattage we could reasonably expect from such a device. Based on the Li-Po battery we are looking at and a charge time of 8 hours of constant walking, we would require 4.2 V @ 0.25 A which means we would need to generate 1.05 W and we are quite certain this would be very very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Does anyone here have more information on the subject who could help shed some light on this for us?

I also wish to ask if anyone here would have information on how to determine the generation capabilities of a DC motor used in reverse and if you could guide me to the equations to use to determine such information from a motor data sheet. We are considering whether it would be more viable for us to use a DC motor in reverse as opposed to creating our own coil winding field.

This is the first task i have led, and i am having some issues!

I am working on a SCADA project, we are upgrading a city wide SCADA system to a newer version of software.  The original Human Machine Interface (HMI) program was Wonderware InTouch 9.5, and the alarm dialing software was Win911 (both installed on same server utilizing InTouch direct drivers from Win911).  We have been tasked to replace their old servers with a shiny new one, our team decided to  take their scada system and virtualize it to prepare for a much larger upgrade in a couple of years (convert to ArchestrA and system platform). For now we have upgraded the HMI software to InTouch 2014 (managed app) and Win 911 7.14 software.  The server is running Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter, the VM's are running WS 2012 Standard 64 bit

I am running into an issue on how to connect a USB modem (HiRO H50113) to a Hyper-V machine, i have found this website: http://www.eltima.com/products/usb-over-ethernet/, but i have not tested this method.

27,"Want to switch careers and become an engineer, need advice",1418807597,"Hello!  I'm one of those who looks back at college as a major wasted opportunity.  I emerged with a BA in Political Science only to find the no one was looking to pay me for my opinions on the differences in the definition of state of nature between Hobbes and Locke (shocking, right?)

Relatively speaking I've done pretty well for myself, but I know what I'm doing (business development in mainly marketing and merchandising analytics fields) isn't what I want to do.  I have a good mind for math, but I haven't taken advantage of it by actually studying anything beyond college calculus until recently.  I have some experience building derived attributes using our own customer database, and know beginners level data architecture, SQL, and Python.

The things I'd like to do -

1) Something technical - I'm cool with some client interaction, as that's the bulk of what I've done in my career so far, but I prefer dealing with more logical stuff than the emotional stuff that guides so much of the ""business"" side of things.

2) Ideally spend a good amount of time working outdoors, working with my hands - I'm not rigidly against working in an office, but I really prefer working outside.  

3) Healthy, sustainable demand - I also graduated with my generic BA 3 months after the financial collapse, and my ensuing period of sustained unemployment gave me a near pathological fear of ever being unemployed again.  This has led to me taking a lot of bullshit I probably shouldn't, and I'm often envious of the data architects and data scientists around my office for their ability to just say ""Fuck this"" and go out and get another gig no problem.

4) Good pay - I don't want to be handed anything, but part of why I want to switch is the financial benefits of tapping into the benefits of my natural talents, which to a certain extent means making a comparable salary to my current one ($55-65k-ish) pretty quickly and having significant growth opportunities should I come to deserve advancement.

What I've read has led me to think that Geotechnical Engineering might be the right field for me, but the other side of it is I don't know shit yet so I don't put too much confidence in that conclusion.  

What do you guys think?  Am I looking in the right space?  Are there other engineering fields you'd recommend looking into?  What should I look for in my education?

Like could an EE do a CS job or vice versa? I understand this would be a huge jump, but I'm willing to work for it.

53,Sourcing Engineers for Startup?,1418694895,"Has anyone here compiled a team of engineers from scratch to work a startup project? Has anyone been recruited to join a new product development team? I'm talking garage with a whiteboard and workbench level development - early stage stuff. 

For those who've assembled, how did it go down? How did you build your team? What resources did you use to find the best people? How did you convince them to sign on? Did you make them equal partners? 

For those who've joined dev teams, how were you found/contacted? As engineers/generally intelligent and analytical people, what do you look for from a prospective startup opportunity? What would convince you to devote your valuable free time (uncompensated beyond partnership and potential for success) and intellectual capital to an unproven idea? Do these opportunities present themselves often (e.g. Every dummy's got a million dollar idea they need someone else to build for them)

So these devices work by directing short microwave pulses at the liquid surface in the tank. Part of the energy is reflected back and the time difference between releasing the pulse and receiving the reflected pulse is used to find the distance to the liquid surface and hence the level. So far, so good. However, would the microwave pulse that was reflected at the surface travel through the liquid and be partly reflected again at the liquid/tank interface at the bottom? How do these devices handle the reflected wave from the bottom of the tank? 



(The theory I thought of myself was something to do with the either reflected wave from the bottom having a different frequency/wavelength or much lower intensity. The latter doesn't seem very feasible especially if the level is low, since then the difference in intensity in the waves reflected from the top and bottom tanks won't be much.)

I'm doing some research into wall-mounted devices, particularly water heaters. I am wondering if there is a relevant section in the US building code that states what minimum design loads are for residential buildings to allow for something of a certain weight to hang from it.

I'm guessing that you probably can't hang something off of an interior wall that weighs 1000 lbs, unless you spread it over a large area. What is the limit? Are there lbs/ft2 numbers that determine the miminum load that houses can be built to?

I've been looking in ASCE 7 but I haven't been able to find any relevant information. Can anyone here give me some information/point me in the right direction?

Edit: The section that looks relevant to me is section 4.3 of ASCE 7 talking about ""concentrated live loads"". It states that the minimum requirement is 200 lb force in an area of 6.25 ft2. Is this number on the right track?

  &amp;nbsp;

**The blue pill option:**

* Work for an EPC company in the Toronto area
* I need to sign their offer within the next month
* Diversified range of projects available. I will be learning very professional and relevant industry practices
* Above average pay for a new grad in the Toronto area
* I can live at home to save some money
* Able to gain valuable experience to get my PEng designation
* As professional as it gets when it comes to an engineering career
* This is the option my brain wants

  
  &amp;nbsp;

**The red pill option:**

* Work for a start up company in Silicon Valley
* No offer yet, but they gave me a strong recommendation for returning after finishing my internship with them. Will not be hearing anything about job offers until at least march.
* The work is more narrow in scope but closer to what I want to do as an engineer. The work is less by the book (nature of the start up world) and I'm concerned this will not resonate well with more professional engineering firms.
* Environment is more clean and modern
* Cannot get my PEng designation (It seems they aren't too keen in the US, especially in the start up scene)
* If I get laid off in the future then I will be in a difficult situation. The demand for mechanical engineers in Silicon Valley is dubious, especially for Canadians. Further, I will be at a disadvantage if I return home as all my peers will likely have a P.Eng designation at that point.
* More pay than the blue pill option, but this will be marginalized by the substantially higher costs of living
* This is the option my heart wants

5. Reversing yoke - connects reversing arm (3) to the reach rod (8) via the drop lever (4).

6. Also the reversing yoke, for some reason the picture decided each arm of the yoke should have its own number.

7. Expansion link - rocks back and forth with roughly sinusoidal provided by the eccentric crank (1) and eccentric rod (2). Just as a reminder, this motion is roughly 90 degrees out of phase from the main piston.

8. Reach rod - connects the expansion link (7) to the combination lever (10).

9. Crosshead arm - connects the union link (11) to the cylinder crosshead.

10. Not sure what this is, it looks to be some sort of shielding? Does not affect the movement of the valve gear.

11. Union link - connects the crosshead arm (9) with the combination lever (12).

12. Combination lever - connects the union link (11), reach rod (8), and valve stem (13) together, sums displacements of the reach rod (8) and crosshead, (with the crosshead displacement being weighted much less than that of the reach rod (8)) and transfers this summed motion to the valve stem (13) and piston valve (14) to control the flow of steam into the main cylinder via the steam ports.

\* Cutoff: amount by which the piston valve (14) overlaps the steam ports, allowing more or less steam to be admitted into the main cylinder.

Full cutoff (no steam admitted to the cylinders at all, regardless of throttle setting) corresponds to the reach rod (8) pin sitting at the center of rotation of the expansion link (7), eliminating any motion of the reach rod. Full cutoff (100% of steam directed to the steam chest by the throttle is admitted into the main cylinder) corresponds to the extremes of the expansion link, with the bottom being full forward, and the top being full reverse.

So now that I've explained all that, can anyone think of what the benefits of summing the motions of the reach rod and crosshead are? If I were the designer I would have just connected the reach rod to the valve stem and called it a day. I cannot at all see the point of the combination lever and union link, but there obviously has to be one, since every instance of Walschaerts valve gear has them.

1,"Car ECU Question: If I tap into engine sensor wires in order to reference analog data for an Arduino, will I alter the sensor readings at the ECU?",1418431113,"X-Posted to /r/AskElectronics/

I'm thinking about creating a ""breakout board"" for my car's Bosch Motronic 1.3 ECU ([as seen here](http://www.rtsauto.com/ecu-pinout-and-electrical-tests-e30/)) in order to control an arduino-based water/methanol injection system. Motronic was designed in the early 80s, so it's pretty damn simple. I just want to make sure that I don't screw anything up too badly. 

The breakout adapter would sit between my car's ECU and wiring harness, giving me easy access to the computer's analog inputs and outputs.

There are a few types of data that I would like to access:

* Open/Closed Continuity

The sensor is a simple on/off signal. When closed, 12VDC goes through the sensor, through the ECU and to ground. The Arduino is grounded to the car, but at a different physical location. Can I tap directly into this line?

* Square Wave Pulse (PWM)

These are both inputs (crank position) and outputs (tachometer, fuel injectors). If I tap into the ECU pins to send data to my Arduino, will I affect the width or voltage of the waveform? 

* ~~Resistance~~

Some sensors have a resistance range, like the coolant and intake air temp sensors, which read between ~200 Ohms hot and ~3000 when cold. Will tapping into these pins affect the measured resistance significantly at the ECU? 

**edit** I was just reminded over on /r/askelectronics that the ECU will read a voltage range which is affected by the sensor's resistance, but not measure resistance directly.

* Voltage

The Airflow Meter (AFM) outputs between 0-5V. If I tap into this voltage signal, going into the Arduino (grounded to the car as well, but at a different spot) will I alter the results seen at the ECU?

In the US, Cape Wind is currently the only major farm in the final stages of development, though there land is being auctioned soon to open up more land for wind farms. As I research jobs, it seems companies are only looking for experienced engineers to create plans for the fields/turbines.

6,Oversized Motor and VFD running at half speed reduces power consumption?,1418412442,"I've been trying to tangle with this question for a couple days now.

Let's say you have a 5hp motor in an air handler, constant speed. It should consume:

kWh/yr = (hp, 5) x (.746 kW/hp) x (Load Factor %, 70%) x (VFD speed, 100%)^2.4 x (hours, 8,760) / (Motor Efficiency %, 89.5%)

kWh/yr = 25,556

Now, why would you not just install an oversized inverter duty motor, let's say 10hp, and install a VFD to reduce motor speed to 50%?  This increase in horsepower is more than made up for with the law of affinity (the VFD speed^2.4).  Is there something I'm missing here? 

kWh/yr = (hp, 10) x (.746 kW/hp) x (Load Factor %, 70%) x (VFD speed, 50%)^2.4 x (hours, 8,760) / (Motor Efficiency %, 91%)

kWh/yr = 9,524

The only thing I could think of is when you upsize the motor and apply a VFD, the load remains unchanged, since it is set by the system (ductwork, diffusers, etc), which means the BHP output of the motors would be the same.  I know this would mean the operating efficiency would be lower on the motor curve the proposed case.  But I cannot find anything, or at least a clear cut answer, as to why this theory isn't applied in practice.

11,Which force sensor solution should I choose for a test stand for model aircraft electric engine thrust measurment?,1418402875,"This is a project for a student organisation and we're limited in terms of costs. We have a 1000W electric motors that are supposed to produce around 5-6 kg (60N) of thrust via propeller. We'd like to measure the thrust and record it with an Arduino Uno. It'd be best if we could be precise to a degree of +/- 1N

The test stand will have the engine mounted on an arm, resting ball bearings on an axis. The arm will be resting against a sensor element which will be measuring the force perpendicular to the arm. So the arm will be prevented from swinging around the axis, because it will be stopped by the sensor, on which the force will be exerted. (here is a similar project, but for bigger engines: https://www.sendspace.com/file/xd0gmz)

The project we are basing on used tensometers glued to a polyurethane foam and glass fiber composite (which is supposed to bend, when the force is exerted upon it). This is solution nr. 1. We'd use 2x this tensometer: http://www.tenmex.pl/index.php?action=tensometr&amp;numer=9 (sorry, it's in polish)

Solution nr. 2 is that we buy a ready-made sensor, and we don't have to play with creating a Wheatstone bridge, calibrating the sensor and such. It's a ready made solution: http://www.czujniki.org/download/km102_en.pdf (english data sheet). This will cost more or less as much as two tensometers from solution 1, and takes less work. But how precise will this be? Probably not very much.


So my questions are this:

- how bad is the solution 2 in terms of precision? Do I understand correctly that the base error is 10% of the measuring spectrum? That is a LOT (like WTF a lot)

- is there a chance that the solution nr. 1 will be more precise? This is a mystery to me right now.

- will either solution need a signal amplifier or does Arduino has a good enough resolution to read milivolts?

- in the end, which one would you recommend?

They go on to use these expressions to derive the reduced Young's modulus E^*. All the expressions are of the form

`[; X^* = X \frac{(1-\theta)^2}{1+b_x\theta} ;]`

where

`[; X = G, K, E; b_x = b_g, b_k, b_e ;]`

The relation `[; E=\frac{9KG}{3K+G} ;]` is [well established](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus).

However, the authors do not fully derive the expression for X=E. This would be useful because I would like to know what b_e is (perhaps in terms of b_g and b_k?).

They supply expressions for b_g and b_k as follows:

`[; b_g = \frac{11-19\mu}{4(1+\mu)} ;]`

`[; b_k = \frac{1+\mu}{2(1-2\mu)} ;]`

but only state that `[; 2 \le b_e \le 3\mu ;]`.

This has been my approach so far:

`[; E^* = \frac{9K^*G^*}{3K^*+G^*} = E(1-\theta)^2 \frac{3K+G}{3K(1+b_g\theta)+G(1+b_k\theta)} ;]`

this suggests

`[; \frac{3K+G}{3K(1+b_g\theta)+G(1+b_k\theta)} = \frac{1}{1+b_e\theta};]`

So far here is where I am at:

- Still need to take the FE exam; will take it in New Mexico in February or March.
- 2.8 GPA from University. 3.2 GPA from University and County College (I started in a college and transferred).

What should I do?  I am not the brightest engineer out there and I realized that late in the game.  I don't enjoy doing the ""hard core engineering"" but I do like the project engineering kind of stuff and that is where my question comes from.  

I would like to eventually leave the military and join some company but I do not know what to do in the next 4 years or so.  In other words, I will get a masters degree but I do not know what kind of degree.. If that makes sense...  I am looking into getting an MBA.  Also, I am looking to get into the oil industry but honestly I don't know where to start.  

So my questions are:

- What kind of job can I get with ~4 years of military experience as a project engineer and an MBA in the civil world?
- What would you do if you were in my position?   
- What can I do to get into the oil industry?  Is it a good idea?

Finally some background on me:

- I am fluent in Spanish.
- Born and raised in Ecuador.
- Not married and not looking to have children within the next 5 years. 
- 23 years old, male. 
- From New Jersey.

27,Unhappy with first engineering job,1418340558,"Hey guys, I graduated about a year ago from a UC with a biomedical engineering degree. I've been working for the past four months as an MRI field engineer for GE Healthcare. I don't dislike my job but don't find myself being very productive in my day to day job activities- nothing is very challenging. I make good money but am lost in a sea of bureaucracy and cannot get my manager/co-workers to help me. 
My dad has been a civil engineer for over 35 years and said he felt the same way when he started out his career. 
Should I stick with this and expect things to get better? Or jump ship and find a new job. The only thing keeping my from quitting is not wanting to be an ""entry level"" applicant at other companies. However, I don't want to waste my time here for another year or two.

1. Is there an intuitive way to understand how a 1-bit stream is converted to a multi-bit stream just by filtering it?

48,What are the best materials we can't use because of price?,1418221605,"So, recently I was wondering whether I could make a hypothetical heat exchanger out of silver (on account of it having a higher thermal conductivity than copper and other pure metals) and how much more efficient would it be than it's copper counterpart if it would indeed be suitable, which lead me to think about what other materials might be used or considered if they were cheap.

I know gold might be used as a conductor for electricity and that cheap platinum would enable cheap and precise thermocouples available for pretty much any use, so I was wondering what materials would be used a lot in various engineering applications if they were as cheap as steel or whatever was currently used?

EDIT: Since some people understood the question a bit differently I'd just like to clarify that I meant for the material in question (or the materials from which an alloy is made) to suddenly become available in large quantities to everyone and not a scenario in which only one person would have no cost restraints.

50,"Did William LeMessurier uphold standard care in ""The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis""?",1418220163,"Hello, all. My question is rather simple, and it has to do with technical liability and standard care. I have been reading on [**this**](http://www.onlineethics.org/Topics/ProfPractice/Exemplars/BehavingWell/lemesindex.aspx) story for a little while now and I have been having conflicting thoughts on whether this structural engineer upheld standard care.

I don’t believe that LeMessurier handled the Citicorp situation really well. Yes, he did efficiently and promptly investigate and fix the faults in the building’s design flaws, but he did it in secrecy. He did not apply standard care to this situation because of the secrecy of the repair process. They worked on the joints at night when there were no tenants present. The article mentions that they covered up the work area on the joints with plywood houses as to not raise an alarm to the tenants that occupied the building during the day. After all, a strong wind at a certain angle could knock the whole building down and kill thousands. So they were risking thousands of lives on a daily basis.  The article mentions that LeMessurier did not want to announce these repairs to the public because he did not want to stir up a panic. Again, one could argue that LeMessurier should have announced this flaw publicly, thus people inside the building and surrounding buildings could be moved to another location for a month until the repairs were finished; but then economically speaking, the companies within the Citicorp building and those surrounding it would lose a lot of money. So we are faced with an ethics situation here, work in secrecy and risk thousands of lives, or announce the situation to the public and the companies lose a lot of money because of relocation. Morally speaking, LeMessurier failed.

55,Pressure Gauge on Suction and Discharge of pumps,1418211037,"Hello, 


I have around 18 pumps at work. I use them in acid application. The lifespan I have been experiencing of the pumps is between 6-12 months.

 
There is no monitoring system for the pumps. The current practice is to change a pump, wait 6-12 months until it is no longer developing enough flow to the tank. This is usually because of worn out impeller, which I suspect due to cavitation. Then replace it with a new one.

 
There are no pressure gauges on the suction/discharge of pumps to monitor the performance. Therefore, I am thinking about installing them. The idea is to start recording the NPSH available, and total head. Therefore, if there is any drop at suction pressure, I would know there might be clog in pipes somewhere. 


My questions are:


1.	Would adding pressure gauges help preventing pump failure?


2.	What do I need to modify in order to install pressure gauges?


3.	Would a flow meter be a better idea for monitoring pump performance?

56,Magnetic Clamp Design,1418210604,"Hi Folks,

I'm looking at trying to build a couple of magnetic bases similar to those used by machinists to hold dial indicators/coolant jets, etc. ([The bottom bit](http://www.harborfreight.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_17902.jpg))

I should probably have just bought a bunch of those, but didn't realise at the time and now have a bunch of magnets  (circular disk type, poles on top &amp; bottom, ~25mm dia, ~2mm thick, something like ""5kg lifting force"") which is probably accurate if pulled straight up) that I might as well use.

They will be sticking to a horizontal 1mm mild steel sheet underneath 2mm rubber pad.

So, 2 questions:

* What's the best layout in terms of pole layout, ferrous interconnects, etc, to maximise their attraction force to the clamping surface? If I use an iron strip across the top, does length/thickness matter much?

 I'd like to keep the bases to approx 150mm diagonal/diameter if possible, although larger probably implies more stability against tipping forces, which empirically is where their hold seems weakest.

 I assume having the magnets close to the edges would help with stability.

* How might I include some sort of 'on/off' switch (given that these are permanent magnets). I'm thinking of some sort of cam or lever that raises the magnets or pushes wide ejector pins out the bottom to 'break the grip' since force drops off very quickly with distance. Any better suggestions? The standard bases I'm now aware of (thanks [Wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_base)) use totally different magnet geometry and aren't suitable for what I've got available.

* Bonus question 3: how does stacking multiple of these magnets on top of each other affect their attractive force? It clearly has some effect, but it's not anything like double in my brief testing.

69,Do all types of lead screws (including ball screws) require an external guide or anti-rotation mechanism for the nut?,1418158656,"Looking at catalogs of various lead screws they seem to only include the shaft, nut, and sometimes a mounting flange on the nut. If I am driving the shaft to translate the nut along the screw to apply a linear force -- is an external mechanism always necessary to 'retain' the nut orientation so that it translates only? I can't figure out if I use a ball screw, will the axial load itself will be enough to hold the nut? 

What is the most simple/standard way to do this? 

My initial thoughts

 - a parallel shaft to the screw that goes through a guide hole on the nut or nut mount

 - a pin sticking out of the nut that rides a slot/groove

74,Go / No Go gauge reference points,1418138830,"Hi /r/AskEngineers, 

I'm in the process of having some thermoformed handling trays made, and have several critical dimensions detailed to confirm part quality.  Two of those dimensions are to be checked through Go/No Go depth gauges for the sake of time and ease of measurement. Both dimensions check the difference in depth between two flat surfaces, with the flat face of the stacking feature on the tray being part of each dimension.  

After going over this with some of my colleagues, the point was made that the variation in material thickness after forming introduces uncertainty into the accuracy and repeatability of the gauge.  Does anybody have experience with resolving an issue like this?

My initial thought was that I could incorporate the material thickness into the tolerance stack I'm building.  This will likely balloon the range between the Go and No Go gauges, but if applied correctly  shouldn't cause any other problems.  Alternatively, I could try to identify a different set of datum surfaces which would still deliver the results I'm looking for. Finally, and least appealing, is to stay the course, and hope that the already fairly generous clearances between trays won't vary enough to cause interference between the trays and the components they're moving.  

I hope that's enough background to define my issue.  If needed I'll to my best to provide a clearer picture without giving up any identifying information.",AskEngineers,ShotgunWedding,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2orf2u/go_no_go_gauge_reference_points/

81,Advice for 2.5 yr grad getting entry level engineering job with no internship experience?,1418115094,"Hey,

Short story, I graduated in June 2012 with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering.  It's December 2014, and I haven't gotten an internship or an entry level position.  Right now, I'm working as a manual laborer at a coating company (May 2014 - present).  It pays the bills, but, as a New Year's resolution, I'd like to come away with a shiny internship or entry level engineering job.  

Achievements in college (not classwork, but class contests where I excelled):

- CSE: Most humorous award for one project. (out of 150+ people)
- CAD: Built Metal Gear REX.  TA wrote ""squealed with glee"" upon viewing.    Didn't go to finals due to rule misinterpretation.
- Controls: first in aerospace class to get magnetic ball levitator to funciton properly
- Space Design: 1st place prize in RASC-AL competion undergrad division for lunar mining project.

Other project work included redesign of Aspire glider and Segway dynamics modeling.  I was also part of a club where we 3D printed a boat for a race (admittedly didn't do much for group other than buy a couple parts and run a couple tests on bonding issues with the print bed) and did some research on propulsion fuels.  

Post graduation:

- assembled a solar panel rotator and designed a controller for it using data gathered through field work (getting readings from solar panels around solstice days)
- took classwork on CFD.  Will start Turb. modeling class in Feb. (ran out of money to finish last year)
- built wind tunnel flow analyzer as pet CFD project
- CAD-ed Metal Gear Ray.  It was the saddest day of my life when Solidworks expired.
- Built random MATLAB, Java, and C++ programs (Blackjack, Pokemon Damage Calculator w/ GUI,etc.)
- Created Complimentary Color Identifier Android App.
- Designed a can crusher for work

Some things I've done.  I'm also reading about hypersonics and flight simulation right now.  I'm really trying hard to stay relevant engineering-wise even though I can't use these tools on the job.

Job hunting I've done:

- Only missed one career fair in college (band reasons).  I go to college and ""grown up"" career fairs regularly, show them portfolios of my relevant work, and hand over resume.  Rarely get calls back.
- Go to conventions to network.  I've been at University conventions where I was the only guy talking to non-students.  It got so bad at one convention that a Prof. on the mic spoke ""Students, this is a good time to talk to engineers in the room.""
- Go to company websites, fill out apps, and apply. I used to tailor every single resume and cover letter I wrote.  But, after 2.5 years, it's started feeling pointless, and my resume has been optimized to the point where I only need to change relevant projects and summary line anyway.  
- Used to go to unemployment office regularly for job hunting classes and resume check-ups.  However, after a ""Solidworks?   That looks like IT."" experience, people assuming engineer = mechanic, and just distrust of some employment specialists there, I stopped going.  
- Reaching out to classmates.  Pretty much all of my classmates had jobs withing 3 months of graduation.  I've tried reaching out to them, but many have been unable to help me, or don't know what to say when I ask what I need to do (""Many of us got lucky.""  ""I just applied online, and got an interview and a job."").
- Looked for reliable places online.  Ask A Manger is a really good site and I've had some questions answered there.  But, the gist I'm getting is that it's easiest to get a job when you are presented as a top tier individual, and it's impossible to present yourself as such with 0 years paid engineering experience and being 2.5 years out of school.  
- Recruiters.  I've gone to Aerotek and Randstad, but haven't gotten much help.  Again, it seems experience is key.
- College career counselors.  I've talked with a couple about my problems with job hunting.  Some have been supportive, which is great.  But, it's been more emotional support than ""here's what you need to do"" or ""here's a number you can contact"" support.
- Linkedin.  I use this more for forums on subjects I'm interested in honestly.  Jobs and recruiters I've friended all seem to want experience.  It's been useful for discovering different companies.

Difficulties:

- Networkers not answering email when I write, or when I respond to their statement.  Makes it impossible to form a relationship.
- Dishonesty.  Similar to above, except these are people who promise to respond to either myself or my family, and don't follow up.  This is honestly the saddest part of job hunting.  Ideally, the people in engineering positions responsible for millions of dollars worth of hardware are people I should be looking up and aspiring to be.  And yet, some people I've encountered have either been negligent or dishonest.
- ""What's the point""-itis.  I've been applying for internships since sr year high school, and, none of those apps came through.  I've been getting dissatisfied with working on engineering projects lately, and I think it's showing when I no longer feel happy when I complete a project.  Instead of ""Oh wow!  This is done and it feels great,"" it's more like ""What's wrong with me?  Why am I such a failure?  I made this thing work, and yet, it will mean nothing?""

I don't know what I need to do anymore.  I really would like to make myself proud and get actual engineering work as my New Year's resolution.  But, I fear it'll be just like last year and the year before where nothing I did worked.  

Which is why I'm here.  I'd like to know what I am missing and what I need to be doing to get an internship or an entry level engineering job.  

Any ideas at all will be highly appreciated.

EDIT: Other things:

- I apply everywhere in the USA.  Most of my interviews have been for aerospace related positions even though I apply to mechanical, controls, systems, test, and structural engineering positions.
- I think I've sent 1500 + apps and have about 70 companies I watch.  That's not that many apps honestly, but, again, I used to tailor everything I wrote because quality, as I've read, matters a lot more than quantity.

-----

EDIT 2.5:  Hey guys, I've read a lot of you've written and have tried to respond individually to each thread since each seems to cover a lot of ground.  A few things:

- I've been looking at life a lot from an achievement standpoint lately since that seems to be a common theme on resume writing advice (list achievements instead of duties).  It came off when I wrote the above and I looked like a sympathy eating braggart rather than an engineer.  I apologize.

- Regarding the 1500 resumes sent, that is a lot of resumes, but it's also my entire time job hunting.  From Sr. year high school --- Jr. year college, I might have sent 100 (concentrated on school).  And from Sr. year college -- now (when I applied much more vigorously), I sent the rest.  But, that rest (1400) was over a 3.5 year span, which is about a little more than 1 resume per day.  I've seen places suggest 3 is a good number.

Anyway, thank you guys for responding.  If anything, I appreciate just talking to someone directly about this and not having it be a complete mood killer like in a face-to face.",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2oqmb3/advice_for_25_yr_grad_getting_entry_level/

85,"Panel of Engineers I: apply for contributor flair, or nominate other users!",1418073073,"Hey everyone! I'm excited to announce that we're finally rolling out special flair for users that have shown that they are able to answer questions in a specific field at an expert level.

Initially the mod team had discussed adopting the same system being used in /r/AskScience and /r/AskHistorians; that is, only qualified users that have applied or have been nominated can have flair, and nobody else. We came to the consensus that nuking everyone's existing flair wouldn't be fair, so we're going to use a hybrid system instead, where icons will denote contributors, while non-icon flairs will stay as they are, and aren't an indication of expertise.

(**Note:** we will also take the opportunity to cut down on the number of existing flair templates to make room, so some of you will need to reset your flair. Don't worry, we won't do this for a couple of weeks so you have time to save it.)

Hopefully this won't be confusing to new users and outside readers, and as always, your feedback is welcome. If you have any comments, please post it as a top-level reply in this thread.

* [**Here's what the icons look like**](https://i.imgur.com/ECzkrGp.png). If you think a field is represented enough in AskEngineers to warrant a new icon, [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskEngineers) and we'll work on adding it.

---

\-

###Requirements for Contributor Flair

* Expertise in an area of engineering. Expertise means degree-level academic knowledge (min. Bachelor's), or an equivalent amount of self-study, work experience in the field, or research.

  * **Note:** we will not ask you to verify your credentials, meaning this is a purely merit-based system.

* The ability to cite sources from engineering literature for any claims you make within your area.

* The ability to provide high-quality answers in accordance with [our rules for answering questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_answers).

###How to apply

Simply post a top-level reply in this thread, and include:

*  **Links to at least 3-5 comments** that you've made in the past, answering a question in your field of expertise. The posts do not have to come from /r/AskEngineers; if you answered questions in /r/Engineering, /r/AskScience, or another relevant subreddit, they will be accepted.

* The desired text of your flair and which field of engineering you want to be designated as. Try to be as specific as possible, but be aware that there is a character limit of 64.

###How to nominate

Follow the same instructions above, linking at least 3-5 comments that *another user* made that you think would qualify him or her for contributor flair. If the user doesn't claim the nomination, they will be given a generic ""Trusted Contributor"" icon that they may opt out of at any time.

###Revoking flair

Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules or fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise.

-smoked weed recreationally senior year of high school

-got caught, but was 17 and only had to write an essay and wash cop cars

-applied for a scholarship with the dod, required top secret clearance

-lied on applications that I didn't do any illegal drugs, but got to polygraph and broke during the polygraph, told them I lied on the application cause I didn't think I'd get the job if I said I did

-didn't get the scholarship (surprise surprise)

-smoked a few times in college probably like 3-5 times a year max

-worked at the army research lab this past summer, needed a background check

-needed a background check, one question was about illegal substances but I don't remember whether it asked if I did any illegal substances in the past few months or ever, but I said no

-background check successful, work at ARL until last week

-accepted a co-op with a small systems engineering company, during the interview the interviewer asked me if there would be any problems getting a secret clearance, I said no

-thing is, I smoked like 3 times max since the semester started in september, but before that I haven't smoked in probably about a year, and then before that probably another year, and then before that another year. I just realized that I smoked while working for ARL.

(x-post /r/AskScience),1418018220,"I am an electrical engineer, and referring to [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Solar_cell_equivalent_circuit.svg/2000px-Solar_cell_equivalent_circuit.svg.png) circuit equivalent of a solar cell, due to the fact that it has parallel resistance (and that pesky diode which will potentially steal some the source's current), ~~it is theoretically impossible for the load resistor to receive anything greater than 50% of the current source's output power.~~ Is this a fault of modern solar technology, or is there something intrinsic about direct electric solar power generation that requires parallel components like this? I know our current maximum efficiency solar cell is [44.7% efficient](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130923204214.htm), if we treat the internal resistance as part of the output, that means we have actually already achieved 89.4% efficiency, that's pretty great if we can just fix this fundamental problem!

9,Question for the Structural Engineers out there: How much water exposure is required to structurally damage a wooden-frame house (specifically a floor beam)?,1417981959,"a bit of background:

I'm currently renting a place and a couple weeks ago I mistakenly overloaded the washing machine, which caused water to overflow and collect onto the (tiled) floor under the machine. The unit is a duplex, with the machine on the second floor and a living room on the ground floor. 

Water eventually started flowing through a light fixture attached to the ground floor ceiling causing a loose connection, which I replaced. There was also some very slight staining on the drywall ceiling (about 1/2 a square foot). I estimated the total water that flowed out of the fixture was less than half a litre, at most. 

So I reported this to my landlord and offered to fix everything, but he now wants a report stating that the floor is structurally sound. Based on the minimal amount of water I observed and the high cost of acquiring one of these reports (as I presume test opening will have to be made to inspect the structural members), I don't think this is necessary. I'm looking for a way to convince him of this and avoid the high cost of this inspection. 

I realize that this isn't a traditional question that get's posted here, but any help will be appreciated. I'm an engineering student, and the tuition fees be crazy so I  want to avoid paying more than is reasonably necessary.

According to wikipedia (yes, I know they aren't the ""best source"", but they link to other articles which claim the same point) :

&gt;For use in commercial light water reactors (LWR), the most prevalent power reactors in the world, uranium is enriched to 3 to 5% U-235. Fresh Light Enriched Uranium used in research reactors is usually enriched 12% to 19.75% U-235

So, my question is: Energy is made from the fission of U-235, so why don't power reactors use the fuel with more U-235? Why do research reactors use the more potent fuel, when they don't harvest the power from it?

(My educated guesses: Higher enriched for test reactors means more fissions, and more neutrons, which is ideal for testing things in high radiation environments. Low enriched for power reactors because it transfers heat better, and is somewhat safer when they are pushing the fuel to its limits.

45,Aerodynamics: Difference in the framework of MiG 23 and F-14,1417795945,"Hello guys



This was a aerodynamics related question so I thought I should ask here. In terms of design both the MiG 23 and the F-14 Tomcat were very similar. They both had variable sweep wings. However, when it comes to the success rate, the F-14 had a waaaaay higher success rate. People have also claimed that while F-14 tomcat was maneuverable, the MiG 23 was not...making it an easy prey for F-14. My question is this: What was different in the design of F-14 that made it more maneuverable than MiG 23? Was it just the dual engine and the avionics or the problem lied within the Frame. 



I am actually drawing a sketch and wanted to know can a variable sweep can be made viable again. I heard that most of the fly-by-wire systems and other technological advances removed the need for a variable sweep wing but I still see some countries like UK and Saudi Arabia use Paravia Tornado till 2025. If someone can dumb it down for me to understand that would be great.

60,[UPDATE] measuring power output of tesla turbine,1417732486,"Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2mpx8i/how_do_i_load_and_measure_power_output_from_this/), and a [photo](http://imgur.com/vBCkSUX) of the turbine in question and a frame I built for it for those of you that asked. 

I wired the outputs of the turbine in a wye configuration [(diagram of my circuit here)](http://imgur.com/3ea3Oz7) and hooked it up to [this 80 amp 3-phase bridge rectifier](http://www.windynation.com/Rectifier/80-Amp-3-Phase-Bridge-Rectifier/-/219?p=YzE9MjA=) in order to convert it to DC. I then loaded it with three 10 ohm resistors (rated to 300 watts each) in series and fired it up with 120 psi compressed air.

I then spun it up unloaded and was reading 40 volts across the DC terminals of the rectifier. I have no idea how fast it spins because I can't afford to buy a fancy tachometer, but it sounds like a dremel tool spinning to maximum an octave or two lower. In any case, at this point I know that if I flip it on and the voltage remains unchanged, I'll be putting out about 53 watts, which is disappointing, and that I've probably done something wrong, but I flip the breaker and load it anyway.

The whine of the turbine drops a couple octaves more, and it holds steady at 18 volts for a whopping 11 watts.

Am I doing something very wrong here, or is this thing a piece of junk? It looks entirely too well made to just put out 11 watts, especially considering it's keeping a 10 HP compressor on just to maintain pressure.

I don't know much else about the thing except that it uses scavenged car alternator stator coils, and the rotor has been replaced with a custom one with permanent magnets.

I'll be happy to answer any questions, I'm frustrated I can't get this thing to work.

I am assuming that the concern about a fixed nodal network is changing boundary conditions and the like, which we would need to do, could make meshing counterproductive.  The other point that was made is the depth doesn't change very much, so we could assume there are no depth changes which would eliminate that variable and make it a 2D equation, and analytical modeling would make sense for this.

I feel like I'm out of my element (heh) here but am just going to have to deal.  Anybody have some insight?

75,How durable carbon fiber really is?,1417681459,"Case in point - an optical instrument that will be used outdoors a lot. Some parts are made of carbon fiber composite - fairly standard carbon fiber cloth in epoxy matrix.

The load on the CF parts is very low - the main requirements are stiffness and low weight. The parts are loaded nowhere near the point of failure (in fact, an order of magnitude below that is probably the absolute worst case scenario, very brief and quite unlikely to occur most of the time). There are no mechanical shocks during usage (it's a fragile optical instrument, not a racing bike frame).

Humidity is expected at night. Heat from the sun during the day - but that's pretty rare (most usage is at night). Temperature range - anything that may be encountered where most people live, but most typical is whatever happens around the year in temperate climate at night. Obviously, it's never used in inclement weather (any kind of precipitation, or high wind).

Let's say the instrument is used twice every week, a couple hours each session, as a ballpark estimate.

When not used, the instrument is stored indoors - either living area, or storage area or garage.

---

Given all of the above, how long do you expect the CF parts to last? From experience, I know that CF can last at least several years. But beyond that? Can I expect a decade? Two? More?

&gt;&gt; To prevent re-ignition, brass or bronze tools, which do not strike sparks, or paraffin wax-coated tools are used during the capping process.

3,What's the use of a second major (Civil and Environmental)?,1417601183,"* Some background, I'm a 4th year currently double majoring in civil and environmental engineering. I'm thinking of dropping the second major in civil because I have the opportunity to do research under two different professors and an internship with a very highly regarded company. My research is in data analysis, parameter estimation, and modeling. This is what I am considering going forward for my research and degrees. However, in order to do the internship and research, I would have to free up a lot of time and this would involve dropping my second major for one research. The research also gives me the benefit of receiving compensation there after a short time period (I'm staying a fifth year too).

* What about applying to grad school? 
* How useful is a double major?

4,stiffness per weight for a structure - isn't it the same for aluminum and steel? (roughly speaking),1417585999,"Material | Tensile modulus (GPa) | Density (g/cc)
---|---|----
Aluminum 6061 | 69 | 2.7
Stainless steel 304 | 200 | 8

If you do the ratios, you get about the same tensile modulus per density.

So, in theory, if you make the same structure out of aluminum 6061 and SS 304, and just change the wall thickness everywhere until weights are equal, then stiffness should be about the same, right? (assuming loads that are not very high)

We think of aluminum as a ""lightweight metal"" - but really, if all you care about is stiffness under low or moderate load, then SS is same as Al at the same weight.

But then why do we keep using Al for lightweight applications?

---

What I have in mind is a structure like an amateur telescope, such as this one:

http://i.imgur.com/FyH6M2o.jpg

Main requirements are stiffness and low weight. Stiffness is important because the various optical components at the top and at the bottom must remain fixed relative to each other as the scope is moving up and down on the bearing. In other words, as the structure flexes under its own weight, the deviation must be very, very small.

But the structure is very lightweight, so we're not concerned with failure under excessive load here.

So why not use SS? It's harder than Al, there's no fatigue, it looks better, it doesn't scratch easily.

There is also the issue of if you want to perform short or long jumps. Short jumps have the advantage that they are easier to pull off but you need more platforms.

25,Building a chicken coop door closer for mom for christmas,1417530041,"I'd like to build an automated chicken coop door closer for my mom for christmas. 

**The Problem:** We have a chicken coop. The coop is an enclosed room where the birds go to sleep or lay eggs. When they aren't in there, they go out to the run to eat or drink or do whatever. We live in New England, and so it gets cold in the winter and at night, so my mom likes for us to go out and close the door to the coop after it gets dark. We hate doing it because during the winter after dinnner and its dark no one wants to go out and do it. 

**Specifics:** The door is simply a 18""x18"" piece of 1/4"" thick wood on a single hinge on one side (opens like a normal door, it doesn't swing up or down). We do have power running to the coop during the winter to power a heater to keep the water feeder from freezing. It doesn't have to open the door in the morning because the birds will push it open to get out. It only has to close the door once it gets dark.

**Possible Options:** So obviously I'm going to need a servo motor with a lever arm to close the door. It would just rest against the wall, rotate 180 degrees to close the door, and rotate back. It needs to operate in temperatures of down to -20 degrees fahrenheit (to be safe, it rarely gets that cold here), and be powered by a 120V outlet. As for when it closes, I'm thinking either (1) a photocell that sends the signal to close when it gets adequately dark, or (2) an internal clock that compares the current time to the predicted sunset time plus a hour or so, or just a pre-set time.

**Questions:** What can /r/AskEngineers suggest for:

1. A servo motor
2. The photocell vs internal clock solution, or any other viable solution
3. I'm guessing I'm going to need some sort of programmable circuit board to capture the logic required to activate the servo motor at the right time. What should I use? I can program so that is not a problem. 
4. A container to protect the hardware from the elements
5. How to convert a 120V power source to what the circuit board and servo motor needs.

I'm a total newbie when it comes to antennas. From what I understand, phones generally use 1/4 wavelength antennas in order to save space, and switching to a full length antenna could improve reception. 

I'm using the [AWS band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Wireless_Services), which uses two spectrums, one for upload and one for download:

&gt;The AWS band uses microwave frequencies in two segments: from 1710 to 1755 MHz for uplink, and from 2110 to 2155 MHz for downlink

The wavelength should be the speed of light divided by the frequency, which puts me in the ballpark of a 17cm whip antenna if I'm going with 1755 Mhz.

I originally thought that couplings were mounted using either a spline fit (which is obviously not the case, according to the drawing) or a keyway (can't find any info on whether or not this is the case). I feel that this is something I should already know but unfortunately my intense research (i.e. googling for the past hour) hasn't turned up any reliable results.

42,LED Chaser - or how to drive multiple flashing LEDs,1417477646,"As a favor to a local high-school drama program, I've been enlisted to ""repair"" the marquee-themed sandwich board where upcoming events are displayed. The existing board has 96 exposed incandescent light bulb slots - the actual bulbs long gone. The lights are nothing more than four sets of standard holiday lights running in parallel, stapled to the back of the sign.

Having exposed glass incandescent bulbs is both a bad idea and a safety hazard. I want to replace the lights with 10MM LEDs. The new lights also need to have a ""chase"" effect.

It's been 20 years since graduating from Engineering school (and I never worked as an electrical engineer) so I'm really not sure if I'm doing this properly.

My design calls for three sets of light circuits, and a standard 555 with variable RC to control the ""chase"" rate of lights. The chase effect occurs by turning on each light circuit individually, in a 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2-3 pattern.

The output of the 555 goes into the clock input of a Johnson counter. To create the light chasing effect, I will use the first three output pins to drive three separate relays. When the counter reaches 4, the fourth pin will reset the counter and start back at 1.

The output of the Johnson counter goes into a Relay driver IC, which is connected to three relays. Each relay will turn on a bank of 32, 10MM white  LED's, connected in parallel.

I'm stuck at how to power the LEDs through the relays. Looks like I'll need three suitable LED drivers, but am unsure if they can handle the constant on-off-on-off current draw from each light bank. Per my 555 design, each light bank will stay on for no more than 3 seconds, and no less than .3 seconds. Is there a special type of power supply I should use?

The platform will be used as a landing platform for paragliding.,1417470398,"Paragliding has been traditionally limited to large open fields due to take off and landing issues. My idea is to create a structure with a platform on top that can be used as a landing and take off platform. When carying it around it will be in retracted form and hopefully not weigh too much. Then when it is about to be used it will begin a computer controlled expansion. The first part of the expansion involves the creation of a rectangular base. This will basically be 4 pole like objects (the material that they will be made out of has yet to be determined but it has to be light weight) connected an arranged in a rectangle. There will also be other poles connected so they form an x inside the rectangle. At the intersection of this x there will be an extremely long pole facing upward toward the sky. It will basically act as a ladder. Now since this ladder is so long it will need supports to stop from tipping over. To do this I will turn the rectangle into a pyramid like structure by making it so other vertical diagonal poles attatch to the ladder. Since pyramids are supposed to be one of the most stable structures in engineering it should work. Now on top of the ladder there will be a platform of a yet to be determined size. This will serve as the landing and take off platform. It also might need supports as well. Now to use it for take off you will drop it on the ground and it will begin computer controlled expansion. For landing you will take a second one of these that you have in your pocket, drop it on the ground, and have it begin computer controlled expansion.",AskEngineers,math238,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2nzbqj/repost_from_rengineering_idea_for_the_creation_of/

61,Online degrees: how bad do they look?,1417403803,"I'm an undergrad junior studying engineering. 

So, I know the place I'm interning at is going to give me a job offer once I graduate. The pay isn't very good, but I'm super super interested in it because the location is good and the work/life balance is incredible (never more than 40 hour weeks, 4 weeks vacation for new hires and up to 12 for more senior employees). The thing is, they want all their engineers to become PEs. I'm going to graduate in 2016 and, starting in 2020, you need a graduate degree to become a PE. So by the time I finally have enough experience, I won't have enough education :/.

Anyway, to get to the point, it's clear I'll need a masters degree. The thing is, the only reputable university located near me won't let me enroll in graduate school for three reasons:

1. They don't let their undergrads go to grad school there (academic inbreeding.)

2. I don't have the grades to get in (it's not a prestigious school, but it's top 3 in my field and I'm an average student.)

3. They don't offer masters degrees in my field (phd only).

So, just looking ahead, should I consider doing an online masters degree while working? Or should I just delay working and do grad school right away?

69,"3 years post graduation, too long of a time to get my 1st engineering job?",1417372268,"Hey Lads and Ladies,

Your advice would be greatly appreciated, an abridged version of my current situation **(TLDR at the bottom)**;

I graduated with a BEng in Product Design and Development in August 2011. During research for my final year project I discovered a government scheme that I seen as a great opportunity to make some money and relocate to London (from Ireland).

Post graduation I saved &amp; trained for a qualification (assessing the energy efficiency of domestic properties) that would enable me to get involved in the scheme. Once qualified I moved to London and worked on a rolling contract basis, with the intention to only do this for a year.

I performed quite well very early on so the main company I was contracting for asked me to set up &amp; manage a team within my 1st month on the scheme. Fast forward a year, with a few clients built up and earning good money I decide to set up my own limited company with contractors working for me across England &amp; Wales to trade for one more year max.

The end of the year came, certain I did not want to remain in that line of work even though I had performed well, I wound the company up and went into a sales based role in London (I chose this route as I would get to 'develop my own desk/business', wanted to be primarily office based and am quite outgoing so thought it would suit personality-ways)

Coming close to a year in this role I have decided it is not for me (stayed this long as I wanted to make an informed decision when the role had fully developed &amp; the people in the company are great so that distracted me from not enjoying the role itself).

What are my chances of getting an engineering/CAD role this long after graduating? Possible at all?

I still have good Solidworks, materials, manufacturing, etc knowledge but no practical experience out of university.

**TLDR; BEng 2011 Grad. Self-employed in unrelated discipline post-university for a year. Set up &amp; ran successful company for another year. Closed company and went into employed sales role for nearly  a year. Want back into engineering/CAD. Advice?**

71,Mass moment of inertia of a solo cup,1417360307,"I'm trying to solve a problem for fun, what is the optimal force to apply to a solo cup for the perfect flip in a game of flip cup? http://youtu.be/hz11Yxn7v6U

I'm having a little trouble figuring out what the right axis of rotation is, and moment of inertia equations to use are. 

I simplified the solocup shape into three parts:

* The bottom of the cup: a disk with radius 3 cm, A = 28.3 cm^2
* The middle of the cup: a truncated cone with r lower = 3 cm, r top = 5cm, and h = 12cm. A = 305.7cm^2
* The lip of the cup: a torus with r = 0.1cm, R = 5cm at h = 11.6cm. A = 18.8 cm^2

Some Calcs:

* Total Surface Area = 352.9 cm^2
* The total mass of the solo cup is 14.17 grams
* 0.0402 g/cm^2 (assuming all parts are equally thick)
* I found the Z centroid to be 5.11 cm above the bottom of the cup, x &amp; y are both 0 since the cup is symmetric in those axes.

This where I got stuck. The force is applied to the bottom edge of the cup, we'll assume straight up (+z). Obviously a torque &amp; z-axis force are created proportional to the distance to the centroid, but I'm unsure about how to calculate the moment of inertia of such a complex shape around centroid? I think i need the parallel axis theorem? Perhaps find the moment of inertia for each shape around it's own Z axis  and then offset to the desired point?

After that, I could solve for the optimal force (varying F, t &amp; angle of application) that would cause the cup to rotate 1/2 rotation while maintaining enough loft against gravity not to contact the table!

One energy inefficiency that seems really glaring is heating and cooling, both buildings and things.. It seems like easily over half of all energy used in the US.

For a little project I'm making I need to activate my loop function when a pressure sensor is activated, so I bought a simple one from Amazon and when I got it, it had four wires, two marked ""alarm"" and two marked ""tamper"". It came with no additional documentation.

 How can I implement this into my circuit?

because we have a different school system i can't just get a master after my bachelor because it doesn't equal a bachelor on a university. i have to take some extra classes to get to the same level as someone at the university.

(PEV &amp; water-based potential energy storage)",1417032641,"Where I am, electricity is expensive, but sunshine is plentiful. I’ve therefore been investigating photovoltaic systems. With these systems you sell your excess to the grid during the day, and buy it back at night. Mostly as a thought experiment, I’ve been wondering if I could store it on-site. Now, I know I could get a big bank of batteries, but I’ve got other assets I want to exploit.  

See, I live on a hill, and on the site of an old plantation house. We still have the old water tank, so I was wondering: what if I put another tank at the bottom of the garden, and connected the two with a pump/generator? 


This is where I need your help. I’m not an engineer, but I’ve done a few back-of-an-envelope calculations, just to see if it would be feasible. My logic is thus:  

The water tank is approx. 15’x18’x24’ =6,480 cf. ft. 

Converted to litres: (x28.3) = 183,384l. 

A joule = 1n by 1m, and 1l =approx. 10n 

So, that amount of water falling through one metre would generate 180,000x10 =1,800,000j (1.8mj).  

I reckon that the bottom of my garden is about 10m below the bottom of the tank. In an ideal world, this would give me 18mj/day. 

But, my system wouldn’t be perfectly efficient, so let’s assume 70% efficiency, because I don’t know any better. This leaves me with 12.6 mj/day. 


Now, my electric bill is measured in kw/h, and Google tells me that 1kw/h = 3.6mj.  

Say I use about 400 kw/h per month, that’s 1,440 mj / month, or 48mj/day. Let’s assume that I use 50% of this each night to power my air conditioning.  

This gives me a target of 24mj storage capacity, meaning that I fall short by about 50%.  

Does that make any sense at all? Are my assumptions reasonable? Is my maths way off? Thanks in advance.

42,Modified computer case cooling: Cooling a 140mm radiator with a 120mm fan and an expanding fan shroud.,1416995284,"Hello Engineers,

I have posted this in various PC modding forums but have not gotten any responses so I figured I would try my luck here.

I am working on a concept that would allow me to fit an oversized cooling radiator inside a computer. The computer case allows me to mount a 120mm fan (a fan inside a square with 120mm sides), but I would like to use a 140mm radiator. The idea is to make a shroud which attaches to the 120mm fan on one side, and the 140mm radiator on the other.

[Illustration](http://imgur.com/2xwFvk1)

My question to you is this: How would such a shroud affect a fans ability to push cold air through the radiator?

56,Idler-Clutching V-Belt Drives,1416947165,"Hi all,

I'm wondering if any of you have worked on the design of belt drives for mobile applications.

The design of industrial belt drives is well-documented and supported by various rules of thumb, design guides, and free design software from the manufacturer. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be the case for light mobile applications.
Many lawn and garden implements use a cloth-sheathed V-belt to transmit power from the engine to a pulley on the final drive, intermittently clutched via a tensioner arm. This can serve as an operator presence/ deadman feature, F/R selector, and provide some rough speed metering.

So far, it seems like designing these clutching V-belt drives to properly engage and disengage is more art than science. I'm hoping someone here can provide some insight into rules of thumb or any resources on how to generate a functioning drive.

So far, we have relied heavily on designs with lots of adjustability (every hole a slot, multiple extra belt sizes, etc) to generate prototypes that work, and haven't enjoyed reliable or predictable results.

Can anyone shed light on this problem?

Specifics:

 -~5HP vertical shaft engine at ~ 3600RPM

-2-3"" driveR pulley

-7-9"" driveN pulley

-~30"" center distance

-Clutching action provided by hand squeeze lever or bail for forward drive (Force generated limited)

-Tensioner on outside of low-tension side of belt, after driveR pulley.

Examples:  ""I am a...

* wind turbine engineer
* deep well engineer

* structural engineer focusing in wind turbine design.
* geotechnical engineer focusing in deep well design.

There are only very few manufacturers of the super-high-tech tools, and only one or two that can provide top-of-the-line ones. There are only a couple of enterprises that provide wafers of the proper purity. There are only a couple of enterprises that provide the correct chemicals. And so on and so forth, except when the provider is just the one.

This is an unusual situation; typically for products in high demand you have a lot of redundancy, and those with low redundancy have low enough demand that a sudden failure at some point of the chain might upset all of a dozen people. Changes in demand are met with corresponding changes in redundancy, and the mechanism is in equilibrium.

But high-tech products are in *extremely* high demand - yet the absurd prices of the entire manufacturing line keeps redundancy very low.

So what happens when, I dunno, Intel's provider of high-purity wafers is struck by lightning, or something?

70,How can i calculate the reduction in drag of a car caused by dumping waste heat into the air behind a car?,1416875591,"Hi,

First time poster, hoping that you guys dont mind showing me how this is done.

**Boring introduction**

***
After stumbling across a [nuclear powered jet engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Nuclear_Propulsion) which caused my brain to melt a little, and made me realise that i had just assumed that a jet engine was powered by the squirting of jetfuel multiplied by combustion. Since the nuclear powered jet engine had no fuel to squirt this forced me to re-evaluate my assumption.

Then reading about the [p51 mustang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_P-51_Mustang) and discovering the designers had used ducted radiators to create thrust got me thinking - if drag is the opposite of thrust, why doesn't everyone dump their heat behind them?

I understand that in low speed conditions the radiator wouldn't work as well (and have heard stories about Volkswagens with poor low speed cooling conking out during summer)

**Edit**

I found these diagrams [Here](http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j55/thelunarhighway/20040823214557371_1_original.gif) and [Here](http://109lair.hobbyvista.com/techref/systems/cooling/f_airflow.jpg) which show the design of aircraft radiators, showing flaps to reduce the amount of expansion after flowing through the radiator.
as I understand, the amount of expansion after heating reduces with velocity?


***

If a car was travelling at 30m/s on a 20C day how much would heating the air behind the car to 60C reduce the air drag?

how do i calculate pressure increase when the heat isn't going into a container?

i found some measurements [here](http://www.gcdataconcepts.com/images/GraphofAllCarFlowData.jpg) although there are no measurements for a meter behind the car (where i think the lowest pressure will be??)

what would be the effect if a radiator was run along the rear bumper, heating air as it passes? would this create lift?

i'm looking for something that is a little more elegant than [this](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/autopia/2009/12/boat-tail-geo-metro.jpg)

71,Temporarily Relocating for a job?,1416875576,"Has anyone had experience relocating to work on a job? I've been asked (or strongly hinted towards, at least) to consider relocating to a city about 6-7 hours from my home for a construction project which would likely be about 4-6 months in length. Taking the job would be great for my career as it's very specialized but I'm really worried about the personal aspect of it - I have a mortgage and dog, neither of which I really want to get rid of. 

I'm doing a similar job right now (temporarily again, about 2 months into a 4 month gig), about 3-4 hours from my home, but I get to go home on weekends and stay in a hotel. Parents watch the dog during the week and then she comes home with me for the weekend. It's a decent balance between making some extra cash and having the weekend to do work on the house and get some fun in (namely skating/hockey!).

I wouldn't be able to go home on weekends and what is sort of keeping me going during the current job is the activities that I plan for my weekends. I would expect the company would rent a house if I were to stay farther away from home and not be able to go home on weekends. On the other hand the cash right now is really good (about 3x my regular take home pay...) and I'm able to buy some things for the home that I'd otherwise have to really save up for. It'd be pretty similar cash situation if I were to take this next project.

But this is what I've got so far. I want to make a 6 -10 meter square area into so many rainbows your head explodes space. But I am not so sure if I have quite got all the relevant expertise to actually pull that off.

Thus far I plan to build 20x20X 20 cm ish Triangle prisms from Poly resin that can be stacked and moved about with some stage lights and mirror panels. I don't think that is going to actually really cash in on all the possibilities of giant rainbows. 
Light sources is another conundrum I am having there are many lovely big windows i'd love to harness  but do you think I'd need to make a blackout box for the whole thing with vertical strips of LED for light  or just  redirecting  daylight, LASERS!??  there are many variables. 
Mirrors would sit on a slinging track around the outside of the square.


Soo If you were going to make an interactive room that 1.Had the most possible opportunities for rainbows 2. Was able to be touched explored and re arranged and 3.Used really efficient resources without compromising on rainbowyness. For example using water prisms rather than polymer or smaller prisms but mirrors to make more rainbows rather than huge prisms what would be the things I should be considering in my build?

So I am having to design a single speed (accomplished in two reductions) gear box. All the shafts (input, idle, and output) and gears will be made out of 4140 steel alloy.

In order to reduce weight I have hollowed out the idle shaft (see attached picture) and the output shaft of the gearbox. I would also like to reduce even more weight by milling out a recessed circle in the spur gear and then drilling out several holes. 

I have attached a picture of the idle shaft which will hold the primary gear and the secondary pinion. How can I determine how large and how many holes I can drill out without the gear failing? Whats the minimum amount of space allowed between each circle and the sides of the gear? Are there any guidelines or general rules of thumb to follow when it comes to designing gear webbing? I have dusted off some of my text books and looked into several chapters of gear design, but I can't find anything on how to design gear webbing.

I have heard that as a general rule of thumb, the space between your recessed circle and the dedendum circle must be greater than the working depth of the gear tooth.

Also, if an equation calls for it, I do know the torques and forces acting on each shaft.

10,[Request] Unusual Circumstances - Need Software Engineering Career Advice,1416720897,"Note - Throwaway

AskEngineers, I have an unusual set of circumstances and need some guidance.

I have been teaching myself programming through online resources, textbooks, etc.

Ideally, this would help me transition into a software engineer position, which in my city would pay more than I could ever imagine, even as a junior dev [source - income of my friends].

I am smart. I am understanding the material. I may not be the best, but I know how to learn. And worst case scenario, I could remain junior dev and still make more than enough money to support my loved ones.

My dilemma -

I have a chronic medical condition. There is no one way at this point, and probably ever, that I could work 8 consecutive hours a day. A job like that, though, has benefits - like healthcare - in addition to income.

A note about healthcare, my condition is complicated and most affordable health insurances don't actually cover what I need. An 8 consecutive hours a day job offers good health insurance and I would be okay.

First problem, is I physically can't do that many hours, regardless of the intellectual level.

Second problem, that kind of job would take place during the same hours that hospitals are open and so I wouldn't be able to utilize the health insurance that I had, therefore making my health unsustainable.

Ideally, I could get a part time job or a full time job that I could work at in the evenings and weekends. So far, I haven't been able to find any. To clarify, it's not that I haven't found any that I am qualified for, it's that I haven't found any that don't require some business hours.

And if there were one that was part time, it doesn't have benefits. Same for if I'm a consultant, no benefits.

Another problem I run into is company size. Giant companies offer better healthcare packages, but are more likely, in my experience to require business hours. Smaller companies, and start ups, are more flexible with hours, but the health insurance package costs the company more.

People in my life keep telling me to simply 'invent an app' and then I'll be fine. While I don't know that much about the financial aspect, it seems unrealistic - between marketing, and funding, and someone else taking the end result and making it better.

So, AskEngineers, should I simply keep programming as hobby? Is there any way to support myself with engineering? Am I missing something so obvious?

Thank you for your consideration

I am trying to figure out how to calculate the heat transfer of this model, specifically, how long I need to make the copper heater so the exit gas will achieve a desired temperature.

The copper heater will be placed inside a quartz dewar vessel (very well insulated) so we can assume negligible heat loss through the walls.

29,Feasibility of designing a propane or kerosene rocket engine that can be throttled at home?,1416609518,"I've been tossing this idea around in my head for a while now but I'm not sure how feasible it is. I hadn't planned on flying it at first. What I am imagining is just a rocket motor mounted to a test stand that I can throttle electronically or mechanically. 

Whenever I try to Google this, I usually end up with really small sugar motors or other solid rocket motors that can't be controlled. I'm not interested in that really. I want something that involves a fair amount of actual engineering i.e. basic flow and thrust calculations, maybe some heat transfer, basic circuit design, and some structural calculations. A ballpark estimate of the thrust I'd like to see would be something like 20-50lbs. Is that realistic? Since I don't intend on actually doing anything with it, it wouldn't need to be really efficient, light weight, or anything like that. The thrust and ability to be controlled  would be the driving design requirements. And the fact that it would have to be built from essentially of the shelf parts as I don't have any kind of manufacturing capabilities. 

I have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering so I'm fairly comfortable with fundamental engineering principles. I'm very interested in the aerospace industry and wanted to do something like this as a learning experience and for fun.

41,Torn up about career pathways,1416554590,"I need some wise words from you guys. I'm in New Zealand in case it matters. My situation: *1 semester left next year 2015, graduating in July or so.

*Got an internship this summer (November to end of Feb) at a very very successful company in the healthcare sector.

*Grades are OK. B average with A grades in management, planning etc. I specialised in Internal Combustion Engines for my specialisation, which I chose over doing Operations Management specialisation.

*I am very hands on, love working on things, endless ideas for contraptions and mechanisms. Good problem solving skills.

My problem: *My role currently is in Operations Engineering. I didn't choose it, I got put in it. Continuous improvement, cutting time and costs... that sort of thing. I always though I'd rather do that/management than be a design engineer but now that I'm doing it. I HATE IT! It's boring me to death.

*I see the work the product design and other design engineers do and I envy them so much. I feel like I wasted my whole degree learning maths, design skills, thermodyamics and all sorts just to end up doing Ops.

*Even though I hate Ops, I am working my ass off. Trying to impress and trying to do the best I can. My manager is highly impressed even after my first week and I can only get better!

My question:

*Should I continue with ops if they offer me to come back as a graduate? The company helps you to work towards a field you would like to work in, as in I could develop myself to be a design engineer eventually but it seems risky... Is ops the way to go? Is it a better field? It doesn't seem like it. Even the senior ops engineers have a very dull job by the looks of things compared to the senior design engineers.

*Should I maybe just be straight up front with them and say I want to be a design engineer or nothing?

The company pays extremely well and the possibilities are endless and I would have an extremely bright career path with them. However if I don't get a design role, I feel like I should settle for a lesser job elsewhere that still lets me do design work. I feel that if I don't use my design skills I'll lose the basics I learnt at uni and find it difficult to get back in to.

I've been wanting to ask for a while now, just haven't managed to get to it. I'll probably catch a pile of hell for it and get bitched at, but here it goes... 



Do any of you work as engineers without a BS in XE? X = Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, you get the picture. 


The reason I ask: I'm considered an engineer where I work, it's a very small company, about 60 people. I have 2 Associates degrees, one in control systems, another in electrical automation. My initial career path was to be an instrument technician or industrial electrician. While in tech school, I realized I should've been an engineer. I've worked as a contractor at a MUCH larger company as a maintenance engineer. Most people were extremely surprised to learn I didn't have a BS. 


I have mixed feelings about my current position. Some days I feel like a fraud, like I don't belong where I'm at. Other days I feel proud that I've managed to make it into an engineering firm, as an engineer, 4 years out of tech school. I hate being asked where I went to school, everyone assumes I went to a real college. I feel like my credibility is instantly removed when someone finds out I only have a 2 year degree. 


I'm just curious if there is anyone else that is in a similar position. I've only met 2 people that are in the same situation. One of them was much older than me, the other I went to school with and now work with.

48,Fresh MechE grad looking for some advice on getting on a robotics career path (Also questions for Electronics Packaging Engineers if you see this),1416526570,"Hi there,

I just recently graduated with a BSME, focusing on mechatronics, as I'd really like to work for a consumer/personal robotics company one day. Currently I'm looking for an entry level position that aligns with my mechatronics interest, as I do not have the money for grad school at this time, and I'd like to get a few years of work under my belt first anyway. 

It's seeming to me that Electrical Engineers have more robotics-related options out of college than ME's, or perhaps that ME-related jobs for the industry rely on getting a masters, like for kinematics knowledge and such. Anyway, I've been trying to pin down such a job, and I'm thinking with my background in mind that an [Electronics Packaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_packaging) Engineering position could be a good first step, by doing thermal analysis and load analysis on electronic products. 

I'm thinking that a small to midsize robotics company would welcome someone who can do both mechanical and electrical work. So, if I can learn a little bit from the packaging side and work on some pet projects in the meantime that show my E-theory knowledge, I can be hired that way. I also could end up liking the packaging engineer enough to just stay with it, though.

Any electronics packaging engineers here that would like to give some insight on their job? Do you enjoy the industry? What do your day to day tasks involve?

For people in the robotics field, does this sound like a good idea? Or any other advice for what type of position an ME might look for?

50,[Archery Related] Energy Transfer,1416525987,"Ok I want to hear this from an engineers perpesective.

So todays average compound bow is made from carbon.... and probably shooting carbon arrows too.

There is a theory that shooting the bow without an arrow in it (or dry firing) is bad because the string shoots back with all the energy and it has no-where to go and is then absorbed into the bow and thus damaging it. And a lot of people claim the bow can explode due to all the force.

Now apparantly when there is an arrow on the string all the energy goes into shooting the arrow and thus safe for the bow.

I just dont understand how or why that happens?

The arrow only weighs a few grams (maybe 100) and the string slaps forward with tremendous force (upwards of 30kg) I find it difficult to wrap my head around the fact that such a tiny arrow can somehow absorb all this energy so fast?

My theory is the hinges fulcrum (likely incorrect term) or pivot point do not align based off the design and thus created stress on the glass causing it to shatter.

additionally, the hinges themselves have spring tensions so they ""rest"" in certain closed positions. the upper hinge rests in what I consider a closed position, the lower rests perpendicular to the wall it mounted on which would be ""partially"" open for the door. I believe this added additional stress to the glass as the tension is significant.

**100 ftlb @2000 rpm**~~

~~What would be the difference in driving car1 vs car2 vs car3 vs car4?~~

Assume all of these cars are made up of identical components except the components that affect torque, hp, and rpm in the way I described above.

~~Hp = torque * rpm / 5252~~

Edit: Torque is in lb*ft, and I understand hp is a unit of ~~work~~ power:


Edit 2: rpm is a unit of angular velocity.


The formula should be:


~~work = torque * angular velocity / 5252~~

Edit 3: Fixed formula again. And I realize cars1-4 can't exist.

Edit 4: I think I screwed up everything here. 

Edit5: Work is not power. Got it.

76,Requesting Help Building a Better Insect Trap,1416474443,"The generic bed bug trap consists of a tupperware square, gluing fabric around the tupperware so bed bugs can climb up, mixing yeast with sugar and water in a soda bottle, letting a small amount of carbon dioxide escape from the bottle via a small straw that points into the tupperware so bed bugs climb on fabric on outside, but can’t climb out on the slippery plastic.

Bed bugs find their host/victim by the carbon dioxide exhaled, heat and body odors. These traps, even with the addition of the heat and lure of body odors (sold as an artificial version on towelette), do not work effectively when a person is sleeping in the home where the trap is - bed bugs find a living host much more attractive than the artificial version.

In what ways can this trap be improved upon to trap more bed bugs? What other types of traps can be used which could be more effective?

Perhaps adding a source of infrared to a trap could help? 
http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_315_Infrared-detection-in-insects/
If so regarding the infrared, what could be a good source for it, and in what 'quantity'?

I intend to put sticky double-sided carpet tape on the ceiling over masking tape (to protect paint) around the perimeter of rooms and on legs of furniture, to possibly trap them if they walk on it.

Boric acid kills insects when they ingest it, as it's a stomach poison. Bed bugs don't groom, so they wouldn't lick boric acid off their legs. How can I get them to drink 'spiked' synthetic blood that contains boric acid? How do I figure out how much boric acid to mix with synthetic blood? (I know, that's gory, but the emotional trauma bed bug infestation causes spawns ideas like this, which could be very effective).

I am renting a warehouse with my band, and it was soundproofed poorly: glass fiber covered with cardboard, nailed to the wall. We cannot afford a better place right now so we have to work with this.

As far as I know, glass fiber is irritating, toxic, and also a carcinogen which may cause lung cancer.

We are planning to spend quite a lot of time in the building, and playing at high volumes which will cause vibrations and might cause fiber particles to go airborne.

So my question is about the exact toxicity of glass fiber and how to mitigate it. We thought about covering the walls with curtains (fabric or plastic?). We would also like to know how to clean the place: dry broom or wet mop? I imagine using a broom may cause glass particles to fly around.

The job was close to home and in a good city so I took it. I had an ok GPA, my only other offer was awesome but in a city I didn't want to move to. The issue is, I don't work as an engineer per say.

I work in a lab, so there is plenty to learn and add to a resume. Bunch of Instron testing machines, dynamical mechanical analysis, thermogravimetric, thermal manikins, abrasion testing machines - a lot of cool stuff I could learn that would utilize my degree in a materials testing point of view.

I have to build a prototype of a device for my senior capstone course and was hoping somewhere here could point me in the right direction as I have little experience in mech E.

To provide a little background my project is based on building a device to rapidly cut strands of hair down to 1mm lengths for drug testing. without the need for electricity. 

My idea was essentially to an array of razor blades separated from each other by 1mm that could be moved by a handle back and forth. The blades are suspended along a set of rails in the lid of a box that when closed creates a contained system to cut hair. In addition the hair is held in position by a comb-like structure that locks in place. /i have a rudimentary drawing for reference: http://imgur.com/DuxXitY

While I have the concept in place I don't know how to go about building it. I need help with several areas:

1. A locking mechanism to keep the razor blades in place within the rails but that allows back and forth motion.

2. How to latch the ""comb"" in place on top of a hair sample

3. How to connect the razor blade array to the actuating handle.

29,Had an idea for a hybrid electromagnetic/chemical weapon,1416254358,"I just started my 3rd year in electrical engineering, so my technical knowledge is still very limited. But I had an interesting idea I wanted to run by you guys.

Basically, you combine a coilgun with a chemical gun.

You take a bullet and put a charge on it. You use the chemical explosive inside of the bullet as a SECONDARY means of forward propulsion, and a PRIMARY means of rotational propulsion. You wrap a coil around the barrel of the gun and feed a current through it. 

The idea is to use a smaller chemical explosive charge to spin the bullet. When you then place a charge on the bullet it becomes a an electromagnet that the coil accelerates out of the gun.

Secondary ideas:

1. Turn the bullet into a capacitor by separating it down the middle (put a dielectric down the middle of the bullet). After the explosive charge spins the bullet and gives it that initial push, have one of the hemispheres of the bullet make physical contact with the coil wrapped around the barrel. The displaced charge turns the bullet and the coil into two electromagnets simultaneously.
2. Have the excess explosive force push an electromagnet through the coil, creating an even larger electromagnetic force propelling the bullet forward. Like [This](http://cfs7.blog.daum.net/image/31/blog/2007/12/11/17/58/475e50798f71b&amp;filename=8.jpg), but have the counterweight be a magnet.
3. Maybe put the battery on the bullet clip to make the gun lighter
4. Could you put a charge on the chemical explosive, and transfer that charge to the bullet on ignition? Or would the heat from the blast render the charge somehow inert?

31,Do you list your active security clearance on your public LinkedIn profile?,1416252913,"If you hold an active security clearance, do you publicize it on LinkedIn? (Whether it's a ""skill,"" in your summary, listed as a qualification, or you have visible ""Cleared only"" groups shown on your profile.)

Obviously it's appropriate to list on a resume when applying for a relevant job, but I am unsure about listing it on a public profile.

My reasoning against it:

* However unlikely, you may be a potential target for foreign intelligence or other nefarious persons using social engineering.

* I don't want potential employers/recruiters to think I'm careless.

* Articles like [this](http://www.topsecretwriters.com/2010/02/is-it-ok-to-publicize-secret-security-clearance/) and [this](http://news.clearancejobs.com/2013/08/05/fake-linkedin-recruiter-nabs-personal-data-from-top-secret-clearance-holders/). Again, I don't know how much credence to give them.

* Error on the side of caution

My reasoning for it:

* It's highly desirable for Space and Defense contractor positions, and I plan to use LinkedIn to network with recruiters.

* Lots of other people list it. 

* The government never told me not to.

* I only hold a Secret Clearance, so I'm not as much of a ""target"" as if I was a program director with a TS/SCI.

* I use common sense and would never disclose specific details about my work to a stranger, so even if I was targeted I can't imagine falling for anything.

What I'm doing now:

* I don't have it listed publicly.

* I have joined one or two ""cleared only"" groups to assist in my job search next year.

* I have hidden those groups from my profile so it's non-obvious, but I still might share one of the groups with cleared recruiters.

* My employer and current job location make it fairly easy to infer that I have one.

**TL;DR: [Government guidelines](https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/resumeDosDonts.pdf) say it's okay to advertise a clearance on your resume. In your opinion, does this guideline extend itself to your public LinkedIn profile?**

50,Designing a mixing fan for a combustion chamber,1416183589,"I'm a graduate student studying diesel combustion in a combustion vessel (that is correct a vessel not a engine). The idea is to combust diesel in an environment similar to a diesel engine (high temp/pres) but wihtout the time varying boundary conditions and complex fluid mechanics + heat transfer observed in an engine. This makes it easier for modellers to verify their simulation data on fundamental combustion properties of diesel fuels without worrying themselves of other things going on in an engine.

One way to achieve the high temperature and pressure is to combust a lean mixture of acetylene and oxygen. This gets the temperature and pressure high but still has enough oxygen for the diesel fuel to burn. We allow the combustion mixture to cool down and at a predetermined set of conditions inject the diesel fuel. 

One requirement of a good experiment is to make sure that the temperature inside the vessel is very uniform. To achieve this we use a magnetically stirred mixing fan. The problem is that the stirrer is hermitically sealed from the outside but not sealed from the combustion gases. I was thinking of using dynamic orings to seal the shaft but am worried that regular orings cannot hold up well against the combustion gases. Does anyone have any ideas on deailing with this problem?

I can update the post with more specific details of the experiment if someone needs it.  I would greatly appreciate any help.

56,Issues with crazy SkunkWorks Project,1416166358,"I was recently given a project to revive a failed electronics ""skunkworks"" project.  It is meant to survive a high stress environment.  The group I was working with originally built the first version, but had issues during a live test.  The group performed technical failure analysis.  The project was brought to a halt due to lack of funding.

One-year later, I was brought on board from another group to continue.  I built new system from ground up, incorporating the wish list from the failure analysis, and improvements desired from last version.  It required new components.  The group is kept updated throughout process, and design is reviewed multiple times.  Every step there is an issue, and it’s my job to find a solution, but I get around them. There was some design creep, but they were justified, and I was able to incorporate what was wanted.  Finally test units are built, and they work on the bench.  Just prior to semi-live testing, suddenly, immediate management says components are too risky.

I bring up the following questions:

What is acceptable failure rate?  0%, absolutely no failures ever.

What is acceptable component failure rate?  0%, if a component fails once, stop using it.

What is established standard for testing (stress levels)?  None established.

What assets are there for testing in high stress environment:  None, have to make your own test equipment (and test that first as well).

Who can work on this project?  Just me, and another ME guy (if there is funding for him)

What is my timeline?  Live test early next year

What how much funding is left?  Shoe-string, at this point.

What does the customer want?  They are willing to accept a few failure, but we can't have any since it ""ruins our reputation""

A quick note about the group, I notice a lot of the equipment has not been properly maintained.  I also noticed a good number of the staff left a few years ago.  There is a general feeling of apathy and poor morale.  Lots of micro-management.

Upper upper management now is getting involved.  They were expecting this to be done years ago.  There is a lot of politics involved.  I know they're not going to do anything.  They're trying to make this ""my"" project, so now I have a ""reputation"" on the line too.

I just don't mesh with the culture that produces this kind of operation.  I have been looking other jobs, but its taking me some time.  I’m not in a good location, and I want to move, but I have family here.  

While I’m still there, what are some ways I can handle this?  Just keep smiling my head and nodding?

We can use an LED array that lights up different colors (Red LED -- Blue LED -- Green LED). The circuit uses water conductivity from a power source that goes through the water and into a logic gate (XOR). The output of the XOR gates will light up a corresponding LED. The smartphone will then take a picture of the LED, find out the color, and send an SMS mesage to a server that detects the water level threshold. Does anybody see anything wrong with this idea..?

The plant I am currently designing involves distillation and a flash drum for the removal of 'waste byproducts'. This waste can be handled by a waste treatment site for a cost depending on the composition.

Situation 1: The waste contains less than 20 wt% component A, less than 5 wt% component B and less than 1 wt% component C. Cost for disposal is set at $0.50/kg.
Situation 2: Any of the above conditions for situation 1 are not met, the cost for disposal is set at $1.50/kg.

My current waste specs contain 0kg of component A, 0kg of component B, 4.9kg of component C, and 25kg of another undesired component that has no specified limits. As such the waste falls under situation 2, as component C comprises roughly 16 wt% of the total waste. 

Is there any way to get the waste specs to fall under situation 1? Addition of other components not listed is acceptable, however every combination I attempt to reduce component C's wt% leads to such excessive volumes that the cost reduction becomes meaningless.

72,Tangible description of isochoric and isobaric input of heat in a dual cycle process,1416089093,"Hey all,

I'm currently learning about thermodynamic processes, and encountered some trouble visualizing the dual cycle process. Specifically, the isochoric input of heat (step 2-&gt;3) and isobaric input of heat (step 3-&gt;4) is what I'm having trouble visualizing. 

[Dual Process reference image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Theoretical_Sabathe_process.gif)

My thought process: Steps 1-&gt;2 is the adiabatic compression of the a/f mixture. At step 2, in an SI engine, the gas is ignited. From 2-&gt;3, the the volume stays the same in the combustion chamber, as the flame front propagates to fill it. Step 3-&gt;4 is where I'm having trouble. At this point, the only logical explanation I could come up with is that constant pressure with a rise in thermal energy and volume (per the criteria for an isobaric input process), there would still be unburnt fuel in the combustion chamber at stage 3. Stage 3-&gt;4 would then describe the rest of the a/f mixture being combusted while the in-cylinder pressure threshold for constant volume is crossed, pushing the cylinder down. This would provide not only an increase in thermal energy (in addition to step 2-&gt;3), but an output of mechanical work. From stages 4-&gt;5, would be the flame front propagating downward, outputting mechanical work by pushing the piston down. Steps 5-&gt;1 exhaust the heat generated, and the process starts again.

I'm not entirely sure if my interpretation, and I'd rather be incorrect and be corrected than be ignorant of my error in interpretation.

However, here is the problem I am running into:

The project is in Caltrans (California DOT) right-of-way, but the client is a local agency, not the State (making this an encroachment permit). Our design implemented an infiltration trench because our initial calcs showed a vegetated swale not reducing speeds enough and our Post-Construction CFS was higher than we want. I don't think we have a treatment issue, but we are always happy to provide extra stormwater quality measures when it makes sense.

We've sized the trench and validated that it would infiltrate for our net increase in impermeable improvements. The problem I have now is building this into our hydraulics model. Currently we use SSA because

1. it comes with Civil 3D
2. Caltrans accepts its output = no calculation sheets

88,"Is it worth continuing my Petroleum Engineering degree in if I'm getting commissioned in the military for, say, 10+ years right after I graduate?",1416014919,"Hello everyone, this is a question I've been meaning to ask for a while now. I'm doing AFROTC and in the middle of my sophomore year (although I can't graduate until 2018) as a Petroleum Major. I've planned on joining the military for a long time but a few times before I've considered the thought about joining the Air National Guard so I could still serve while having a job in the oil industry (mainly for salary reasons).
 
However (I'll try to keep this short), I eventually realized that petroleum isn't for me and decided to pursue an active duty military career like I originally wanted to. I want to stay in until I'm eligible for retirement, but I know that nothing is set in stone and things could change at a moments notice. I still want an engineering degree and momentarily thought nothing of changing my majors, until some of my dad's engineering friends (including petroleum) told me that it could be very difficult to find a job in the oil industry even with a petroleum degree if I get out of the military over 10 years later (assuming I do become an Air Force Pilot, which has a 10 year contract, not including UPT). It makes sense that they would pick someone fresh out of college who has done internships and is younger, over a 34-35 year old who remembers absolutely nothing about the oil industry or petroleum in general. They said it would be better to work towards a major like mechanical or electrical engineering but I wanted to hear the opinion of the /r/AskEngineers subreddit as well.


So while I do as of this moment want to stay in the military until I retire, I want a backup plan in case anything happens and I don't want to be unemployed for a long period of time just because I have a degree that in my situation won't help me find a well-paying stable job.

This is a real life problem I'm trying to figure out, and I've already spent 2 hours without making much progress.  If any of you could lend a hand, I'd be very appreciative.

Here's the situation.  We recently completed a bunch of welding repairs at a power plant.  The material was T-91, which requires heat treatment.  It also requires the use of purge paper (paper that prevents air flow in the tubes while welding, thus keeping Oxygen off your weld, but also dissolves in water).  I need to calculate how far from the heat treatment source the paper needs to be so it doesn't get scorched, because then it's not so water soluble.

Here are the relevant parameters for the problem (as far as I could figure - if you need more just ask):

* Outside Tube Diameter - 2.25""
* Tube Thickness - 0.260""
* Tube Material - A/SA 213-T91 - [Thermal Conductivity at 20C is 33 W/mK and specific thermal capacity at 20C is 622 J/kg K](http://www.s-k-h.com/media/de/Service/Werkstoffblaetter_englisch/Kesselrohre_ASTM/P91_T91_engl.pdf)
* Temperature at heat source [(shown as red band in this hastily sketched diagram)](http://i.imgur.com/aEPkxY9.png) - 1300F
* Ambient Temperature - 70F

Other Considerations / Assumptions

* The tube is empty inside (air) and uninsulated outside
* The band has been at 1300F for approximately 8 hours

How do I calculate / establish what the temperature gradient would be along the tube?  There will be heat losses to the environment on both sides of the tube, as well as conductive heat losses along the length of the tube as you move away from the heat source.

Right now it is looking like the ice screws could not attach to the iron surface and the harpoon did not work properly.

It type of work is more hands on and almost no design. I get to travel a lot and everyday is full of quality learning. The main problem is that I had to move to a new city and due to the nature of the job, I'm not given any time to form a social life or build a good foundation for my new life in the city. My work schedule is pretty random, where i'll be sent out of time for X amount of days to complete a project, and then i'll have a grace period from anywhere from one day to one week or more. this doesn't really allow me to meet new people or commit to a club. most of the time on my days off i'm just sitting at home waiting for my next work day. 

This new job is a fly in/ fly out schedule, so at least it will be consistent and i can better plan my days off because i'll know what to expect. However, the new job is an EIT position that involves a lot more mechanical engineering rather than electrical. I'll be able to return to my home city where my family and friends are. I'll still get a lot of site experience, and according to the employer, it is a great way to get into a project manager position, and that is something i'm looking into 5-10 years down the road.

I'll be straying off my field of study (even though mechanical was my first choice of discipline and electrical second), and I think i'll be sacrificing some valuable technical knowledge that i get from my current job.

I was thinking that in terms of thrust, high bypass turbofans are less efficient than low bypass. My reasoning was that as air goes through the core, energy is added causing the air to exit with much greater force than it came in with.

14,Civil/Structural - Can anyone suggest what this linear staining on this concrete slab could be?,1415918006,"[Concrete slab pour!](http://imgur.com/a/JDFhx)

Hi there :)

The linked photos show a 1st floor concrete slab poured on the about 2 weeks ago, which after curing has regularly spaced staining or colour differentiation. I have a couple of theories as to why it may be occurring, but haven't been able to find any suggestions on Google or from others in my office as to why it has occurred. 

**Some info on the Concrete pour:**

* Concrete grade C40 with 20mm coarse aggregate.

* Due to sun exposure a curing agent was applied soon after the pour was complete (Sika AntiSol) in order to reduce the rate of evaporation of water from the surface so as to avoid plastic cracking.

* Rebar arrangement as seen in photos is composed of a grid with h16 and h10 bars, 25mm concrete cover which was achieved.

My initial reaction was a lack of cover to the underlying rebar grid and poor workmanship by the concrete subcontractors. However, the surface of the slab appears level when checked with a straightedge and the 25mm cover has been achieved. Secondly I thought it may be due to a temperature differential between the steel and concrete during the curing, causing a slower rate of curing in areas with more concrete and less steel and hence a different colouration, although that might be based on my own backyard science lol. Do you guys think the curing agent may be the culprit? Or is this an example of over-vibration and settling of aggregates/ poor workmanship?

I do apologise if this is in the wrong subreddit, hopefully you guys have seen this before and know whats up :)

**Edit 1:** Sorry, made a mistake in the above info, 30mm rebar cover required.

**Edit 2:** Thanks for the help guys, I think some core drills will be necessary to assess the cover achieved, and as the Clerk of Works, I'll have a chat with my boss and discuss the application procedure that took place with the Sika. I'll keep you posted as to what comes of it, cheers :)",AskEngineers,Chalecobandit,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2m83n3/civilstructural_can_anyone_suggest_what_this/

Feel free to kill this post if it violates the rules; it's ""school-related"" but more about peoples opinions on the quality of engineers these schools produce. Posted to r/engineeringstudents without much luck.

I'm knocking out my Master's in ME here in the states and am considering pursuing a PhD in Controls. I'd really like to do my graduate studies in Europe, but am having trouble finding information on the quality of the programs there. My school has a good relationship with the university at Bergamo in Italy, which has a 3-year PhD program and looks like lots of fun, but the only example of a dissertation I've seen done there was barely even undergraduate worthy. 

I've looked into Cambridge and UMIST in the UK, but have heard (from my advisor who spent a year there as an exchange student from MIT in the 70's) that these schools tend to be _too_ theoretical and resultingly trap your career in academia. The math+theory is actually a big draw for me, but I'm an engineer first and a mathematician second =p

Does anyone know of a place where I can get a review of the strengths or pros/cons of different PhD Controls/Mechatronics programs? The quality of engineers that tend to come out of the programs, what they focus on/have available, etcetera, would be great.

29,Could use some help frankensteining two wires together for charger,1415854683,"Hi

So in a previous lifetime, I bought an FM transmitter (for which I cannot find a link for unfortunately) that had a small port for an iPod charging cable it came with. It worked fine up until the first generation of nanos and whatever came out with it. Now I would like to splice it together with the female end of a USB so as to make it a universal charger. [This](http://i.imgur.com/TzjyKvt.png) is what I have in mind. Sorry I don't know what the USB schematic symbol is but according to [this](http://www.moddiy.com/product_images/uploaded_images/patillaje-conector-usb.jpg) and others, I should be putting the red and black wires together (the old cable has only black and red wires).

I plugged in the the cable and tested the voltage across it and found that it was about the same as the source (~12V) so I just assumed that the FM transmitter portion didn't consume much. With that in mind and a store bought charger for reference, I wanted to make a charger that could deliver 5V and 1.5A.

The next part was my thought process. Please correct anything I did wrong.

So to start, I needed the resistor to consume ~7V and wanted to cut the current down to 1.5. With Ohm's Law, that brought the required resistance to about 4.66Ω, so 5Ω to be safe. Then with P = VI, the wattage I was looking at was about 10.5W. Then for safety upped the wattage by 33%, so about 14W.

I just wanted to know if I missed anything or if this could be improved somehow. I didn't know where else to go!

What I am looking for is some type of literature that can pretty much walk me through the design of a square concrete tank. Maybe a .pdf of a book or something. [Here](http://imgur.com/9nAVDkN) is a conceptual drawing I came up with for a preliminary design.

I went with a square tank over a circular one because the increased cost of labor due to the form work will heavily out weight the cost of concrete.

The tank walls will be a continuous pour, mated to the base slab (extruded rebar connection) with a rubber seal of some sort.

The tank volumes are what I am constrained by, so the overall dimensions are pretty much fixed.

I guess what I'm mostly worried about is the fact that I cannot definitively come up with a wall thickness and rebar construction design to constitute if this tank will work or not.

This is the scheme of the mechanism with the forces: http://imgur.com/95XQKxh 
The RPM are low, about 120 RPM top. All dimensions are in millimeters. 
I am using Module 1 teeth, that seemed the best option but I am opened to use another teeth module (preferably smaller). 

I would like to know what is the best material and width of the gears. 
I am looking to have the narrowest and lightest gear parts as possible.
At the moment I thought that I could use hardened steel with 6 mm thick gears but I haven't made any calculus (i don't know exactly how to do it).

I have thought using aluminium gears, but the input a got (here at reddit) is that aluminium gears is not a good option for gear mechanism. 

I would like to use plastic because is lighter and easy to lubricate. If so what material would you suggest? For what I have searched it seems that Delrim or Nylon are best options (hardest and easy to lubricate). 
In that case what would be the minimum width of the gears? How can I calculate that?

Thank you for your help.
Regards.

To give a bit of background about myself, my Master's thesis in civil engineering was officially approved in July.  My GPA isn't incredible, but it's a respectable 3.25.  I've taken tons of design classes, advanced dynamics classes, and solid mechanics and FEA classes throughout my 6 years in school.  I have zero industry experience, but the experience I do have comes from interning for an architect, as well as undergraduate research and TA work.

Now initially I was using the ""throw tons of applications out for entry level structural engineering positions"" technique, but I realize since I don't have a 4.0 or any internship experience, I'm just wasting my time. 
My current approach is to try and find an email address in the ""contact us"" section of each company website, and email that person, asking if they or someone else could meet with me to talk about the company.  I'll see if that works for me, because my school alumni network is useless, and I can't use LinkedIn because it won't let you do anything without paying.

The funnel at the top is holding particles that are 150-200 micrometers in diameter
The particles are then dropped 1-2 at a time (ideally 1) into a steel chamber
A valve opens that releases a predetermined amount of air into the chamber, which then accelerates the particle down the steel cylinder.
The particle then makes impact with a material to test the strain/damage of impact of the particles on the material.
A camera is used to capture pictures of the particle to analyze the angle/surface of impact.

He wants these components to be controlled by Labview. Honestly, I have had no prior experience to building a system like this.

Best technique we have at the moment is to use a 110V vacuum pump to draw out a sample into a gas-bag, let that cool/settle, and then stick the analyzer on that.. But this means lugging about a extension cord and pump...

Anyone got any techniques/ideas to sample on-line while avoiding the dust/condensation problems?

Also if anyone could figure out a way of taking wet-bulb temperature (or absolute humidity) without sticking a wet-bulb into the dust loaded pipe that'd be cool!

Thanks all!

Ok so far the best I have is something like a [Whatman in-line HEPA filter](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/wha67029500?lang=en&amp;region=GB) to catch the dust, followed by a silica-gel desiccant bed to grab the moisture...",AskEngineers,_The_Editor_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2lyez4/gas_sampling_in_humiddusty_processes_anyone_got/

I am currently finishing up my final year of university studies in mechanical engineering and I had a few questions before throwing myself into the job market. 

My first question is about design portfolios. I am definitely interested in a design engineering job over manufacturing or quality or any other branch of mechanical engineering. I have created a portfolio with six samples of work demonstrating my abilities with CAD modeling, prototyping, machining, testing, and manufacturing. Now bearing in mind that there is no set response since every job is different, I was hoping to get some feedback as to how many examples I should have on my portfolio from engineers with field experience. My portfolio is currently in PowerPoint format but I was also thinking of creating a personal website to showcase my work. Any thoughts on this?

I was just sent this picture by one of our laborers and asked if they need to shut down the whole site. This section of pipe on the thermal oxidizer is lined with red wire, which has a 240V current to protect against freezing, and is surrounded by thick insulation.

Well, all the insulation is burnt off and there is just wiring there.

How big of an issue is this? I'll be honest, I only know of how thermal oxidizers work through wikipedia. My understanding is they heat the gas to 500+ degrees. The vessel would be extremely hot. I can't see why it would need heat traced.

3,"While working for a large engineering company am I obligated to share my designs with another department prior to filing for the patent just because they are the ""Design Department""?",1415671877,"**Background:**  I work for a large engineering company.  My department is part of development and we evaluate the designs made by the Design Department who does the 3D drawings and project management for their parts.  A few weeks ago after a review by the Chief engineer he asked us to come up with countermeasures to an issue with the vehicle.  The designs made by the Design Department would have worked to fix the problem seen by the chief engineer but not without hurting our performance and the performance of some of the other development groups.  My group came up with 3 designs which we considered patentable and that would not negatively affect the other development groups.  3D drawings were done by me and finite element was run for confirmation.  Prior to presenting the designs to the Design Department and the Chief Engineer we filled out the paperwork to turn into the Legal Department for the designs.  The design department had no input into the three designs.   
  
  
To submit the paperwork we need to get our Manager and our General Manager's signature.  My Manager signed it without any issues.  The General Manager told us we should not be filing for this before the design department sees it and that they should be the ones to patent it since they are the design engineers.  He also said we should not be creating drawings and that we should only be evaluating their designs.  The designs were given to them but due to our legal department I will have no idea if they file the patent unless they include our names which if history is any indication they won't include us.  This is the main reason why we were going to file prior to the presentation.  
  
  
Even though company owns all the patents we still get bonuses for them and they can help with our promotions.  On top of this I have been unmotivated to produce future designs.  

**Question:**  Am I obligated to share my designs with another department prior to filing for the patent just because they are the ""Design Department""?  Am I making a big deal out of nothing?

4,Seeking advice about changing firms early in my engineering career.,1415668286,"I am a young civil/transportation engineer currently in my first ""real"" engineering job out of school. I have been at my current firm for 1.5 years. I really enjoy the work that I do and love being challenged by interesting projects, however I am feeling disheartened by my current job/the firm I am working at. I do not feel respected or taken seriously by my boss; who consistently passes me over for projects and just generally seems to ignore my overall existence. I have one project I have been working on for the past year with another PM, but majority of my department's work gets divvied out by my boss and when I request more work or say I have availability, he brushes me off. Also the one project I am working on is incredibly frustrating because the PM (not my boss) does not actively manage it; it is way behind schedule and over budget. I feel like since this project is the only one I have ever worked on, it reflects poorly on me, however every time I try to discuss it with the PM or try and work on something else, I am again brushed off or ignored.

In the past couple weeks we have gotten some new projects and my boss has given work from them to other engineers that are already juggling 2-3 other projects. Within the same staff meeting he told me that he didn't need any help from me on other projects, but then told the other engineers they should expect to be working overtime this month. This is just one example, but ultimately I enjoy civil engineering but not my current place of work.

Have any engineers switched firms/places of work early in their career and had it work out great or not?

What I'm curious about is this:  What would cause one lamp versus another - both in the same house, and both using the same brand bulbs - to deposit the vaporized metal at a significantly higher rate?

If I have two lamps that have both been running for about a year since their last bulb change, one will show next to know vaporization deposits on the glass, while the other will have the glass tube looking like a solid rod of graphite (i.e. the inside of the glass across the entire bulb is silvery gray metalic, causing its light output to be significantly dimmer than it should be).

Before considering a batch issue with the bulbs, I will state that this pattern has existed for several years, across several batches of bulbs purchased.


The only possibly significant variables I can think of are:

- They probably have different switches inside them.

- One uses an extension cord, the other does not.

- One may have had its bulb socket and reflector replaced at some point.

- They're not plugged into the same circuit branch within the home.

When doing simulations or implementations control engineers use algorithms that are built either using continuous time or dicrete time.


The basic idea stays the same, and often, only details change. For example, I had classes that explain Kalman filter using continuous time but a company I interned in insisted that I use discrete time when I programmed a Kalman filter for them.

Note : My classes used MATLAB, which have a ton of Toolboxes whereas the company used Python for their algorithms.


**So, these are my questions :**

* Is there some kind of *rule of thumb* for choosing between continuous and discrete or does engineers choose the one they like the most ?

* Can you give examples of systems on which continuous time used?

31,UK house and ground rod,1415561704,"We recently had a water meter installed but part of that supply pipe is now plastic. The only ground I can see in this house is from the main box to the inside water supply copper pipe. This internal pipe goes about a meter down and then off horizontally with the outside. From house wall to where the pipe becomes plastic is about 1 foot. By pure luck (while studying pipework online) someone mentioned that water repair work caused a break in the grounding continuity.

So, it seems this house (about 40 years old, UK) was earthed to the main water supply pipe and nothing more.  Forthcoming work will make the current copper pipe non-existant, therefore I won't be able to reconnect that earth to it. A rod will be needed.

And having said that, the main electrical box earth wire will then connect to that rod and that part will be done. But all the copper water pipes in the rest of the house will also need earthing? To a second rod?",AskEngineers,[deleted],/r/AskEngineers/comments/2lsbvv/uk_house_and_ground_rod/

37,"Pulleys, Belts, and Motor HUGE Confusion - Need for Assignment",1415525800,"Hello there :) 

So basically, I'm working on an assignment and I need to make a system that produces 44 rpm (speed 2) and 28 rpm (speed 1) at the tool, using pulleys, belts and a motor. Basically, I need to size the components that make this happen.  The confusion happens here: I can't understand what are the specifications specified of motors on websites' catalogs for example. 

Let's take the following specifications as an example. (randomly selected motor)

The following are the names of the columns, respectively:

Name, Power (kW), Power (hp), frame size, shaft size, exact motor speed, full load current, full load torque, locked rotor torque, weight.
M3BP	5.5	7.5hp	132	38mm	2865	10.4	18.3	2	68

I'm getting confused because the 5.5 power is good enough for us since we need 4.5kw for speed 2, and 3.4kw for speed 1, and the hp is good, since our max hp required is around 6.023 or w/e, but on the other hand it's 2865 RPM? Doesn't that mean I need to reduce 2865RPM to 44 or 28 (my required rpms) using the pulleys? Also note, I can only use 2 pulleys. Wouldn't that make it like a driver pulley of 1 cm, and a driven pulley of like 100metres? (exegerating to try to explain what I'm thinking).

39,How can I find out the amount of weight fully supported I-beams can hold?,1415511716,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask this. I apologize in advance as I know this information is out there, but I don't know how to interpret the tables I've found.

**Context**

I currently work for a small steel company. We stack plates of steel outside, separated by 4 x 4's. They are stacked on a flat surface. My employer is considering building pallets with I beams. This would reduce the time it takes us to move the plates (with cold winter temperatures in mind). He has tasked me with finding out how much each one of these pallets might safely hold.

**Pallet Information**

We would use S6 x 17.25 I beams made of A36 steel that are 60 inches in length. 3 beams would be placed 30 inches apart and connected by crosspieces of steel plate (the pallets haven't been constructed yet so I'm not certain of the thickness or layout).

We are only looking to stack the plates 5 high. This would mean the absolute maximum weight on the bottom skid would be 100,000 lbs.

[Here is one of the charts I found while trying to google this problem.](http://sketchup.engineeringtoolbox.com/astm-a6-american-standard-steel-s-i-beams-c_2.html) Unfortunately, I don't know what to do with the moment of inertia / section of modulus, or if those are even what I'm looking for here.

**Questions**

Can three 60 inch long A36 steel S6 x 17.25 I beams safely support 100,000 lbs of weight?

How much weight can they support?

40,Need advice/discouragement on making a multiple spindle drill attachment for robot (gang drill?),1415510139,"I'm building a wood drilling robot. 

It will always be drilling two holes, the same distance apart, same size, etc.  

I can save myself one axis of control if I can figure out how to do build this, which basically turns the robot into a drill on a sled.  

Here are some stunning artist depictions http://imgur.com/a/i6D8q

A complication is that those two shafts are about an inch apart from each other, probably not enough room for standard drill chucks.

I have zero experience with machining but I'm willing to learn if I have to.  But I'd rather just order parts off
the internet.  I know what bearings are, I can probably get aluminum plates drilled from some rapid prototyping 
service.  I have no idea where gears come from.  I'm also kinda broke.

This might be doing a lot of drilling if it works.

Is this doable? Reliable?  Robust? Or should I just add another axis to my robot?


EDIT:  Just thinking out loud.  How about two plates with 3 identical spindle holes in the right places, fill those holes with bearings.
use standoffs to make a plate sandwich.  Each spindle goes through 2 bearings, one on each plate, put gears near the ends of
each spindle, in between the plates.  Could it be that simple?

It brought to mind a question I've had for awhile, but frankly have no idea who or where to ask, so I thought I'd try here.

Would it be possible to create EMs that could be quickly activated to magnetically attach a driver's forearms to his harness?

He had about enough time to go ""Oh shit,"" and tuck his arms.  However, human muscles, being squishy and full of liquid, are (relatively) not strong.  A lot of drivers break things when going full rag-doll.  Some forms of racing require straps on the driver's arms to prevent this from happening.  Off-road racing does not.  Frankly, the straps are shunned because of the amount of movement that's often required and the straps are quite restrictive.

A panic switch and EMs on the shoulder straps of the harness and on the wrists of the driver's suit could have given the driver a way to protect his arms.  But that is a crazy amount of G-forces.

Is this something possible?  Or would it take far more power than a car could produce, even in a panic-energy-dump sort of situation?

I love the subjects involved in it, and love the concept of it. I am highly proficient in math and science. I want to go to college for electrical engineering, but I am just not quite sure if it is the correct career choice for me. I love the concepts of it, but I am unsure exactly what the specifications and possibilities are for jobs in that field. I need some help for this. I have two main questions.

First off, there are certain requirements of some jobs that I just wouldn't be able to do. I have no problem working, but I would not be able to work some crazy amount (like 60 hours a week). I also would hate being forced to constantly travel all over the place. Some people enjoy this, but I do not. I am perfectly fine with occasionally having to travel, but would not be able to hold a job where every week I have to fly to another part of the country. I would absolutely hate that. Furthermore, I would like to have at least a few days off, and a decent vacation time. I do not know if this is possible. Do all jobs in electrical engineering require me to do these things? I would be willing to work more than average, or travel a bit (especially if I was given benefits or a good vacation in return), but I do not want my job to become my entire life. I enjoy having at least a bit free time.

Second, what do electrical engineers specifically do on a day to day basis? I don't quite understand what an engineer may do at work every day, so I would love some clarification on that. What are some types of jobs in electrical engineering, and what exactly do they do each day?

So, these are my two main points of confusion. I would love some clarity on whether or not it would be possible to get an electrical engineering job where I don't have to work 60 hours, travel every week, and get no days off. Then, if there are any jobs where I wouldn't have to do these things, what exactly would I be doing each day in those jobs? Thanks for any help. It is greatly appreciated.

68,Electricity and Magnetism learning resources that are elegant and intuitive?,1415387809,"I've learned about E&amp;M from two main parties: Electricians and college classes.

Electricians explain E&amp;M with their own experiences. ""Well, it works because I've seen it work"".

College textbooks explain E&amp;M through math equations and math proofs. 

I'm not a fan of either teaching method. Proofs are too abstract, and learning through trial and error takes the better part of a career in the field.

I like to learn through metaphor. Elegant, simple, and precise metaphor. ""Electricity can be thought of like flowing water..."", or ""Think of an electric motor like the spokes of a bicycle..."". The concept is simple: Take something complicated, and compare it to something not-complicated. That way I can use my not-complicated model to predict how the complicated mess will behave during unknown conditions.

I'm not asking for a specific metaphor. I want a -learning resource- that uses simple and elegant metaphors to explain the entirity of electricity and magnetism. I shouldn't need complex math or life experience to be able to theorize on advanced E&amp;M.

75,Air pressure questions for an intermittent air motor system.,1415375791,"Hello all, I've got an air line pressure question that is out of my realm of knowledge as an industrial engineer, so pardon me if this is an easy one.  

I have an air system that essentially looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ICHj8iJ.png), and is currently being fed at 80psi.  Will the PSI at the end point still be 80 or is there loss from the splits?  Or, does the PLC solenoid valve control the PSI?

The issue I'm having is that the pressure regulator on this system will allow me to set a pressure, but once the solenoid valve cuts the air supply off the pressure regulator essentially resets and will not maintain the set point.  I'm starting to wonder if this is a design flaw and the pressure regulator(s) should be feeding the solenoid valve and not the other way around.

Thanks for any help or input!

EDIT - Just for clarification, my issue is with the pressure regulators ""resetting"" to a lower PSI every time the solenoid cycles.  At first I wondered if this was happening because of a pressure drop in the system (because each regulator is running at a different psi, which is an issue).  Thanks to the input from everyone, I think the root issue I'm having isn't caused by loss of pressure but from is cycling the air sent to the pressure regulator.  I can't really go into our exact application, but basically the pressure regulators control the motor speed by increasing or decreasing the psi. The motors are used for 2-3 seconds, down for about 30 seconds, then back up for a few seconds, etc.  

I'll be getting some of the lines swapped around to regulate the pressure going into the solenoid instead of the other way around and see if that fixes my problem. I can fine tune from there with a strobotach to get the speeds where they should be on the motors.

5. The fast moving, expanding exhaust creates a lower pressure in the combustion chamber and sucks in more air from the supply, creating a self sustaining reaction.
