0,Boston Scientific vs Medtronic: Which is better to work at?,1534189524,"Hello Redditor,

I have been searching for a long time regarding this question. I currently have an opportunity to work at either of these two amazing companies as their quality specialist.

1,Venturi/Aspirator Pump limit - Is it possible to make the outlet too small?,1534185519,"I am trying to draw a vacuum on a flask I have, and I think that a Venturi/Aspirator pump would be the way for me to go. I plan to run a small water pump to move water through an aspirator pump and try to get a vacuum of 100 mmhg or so. My water pump is very weak, much weaker than a faucet, and I am pretty sure it won't draw the vacuum I want.


With that in mind, I can increase the vacuum by having a smaller hole. Would it be feasible to block a portion of the outlet on an aspirator pump in order to increase outlet pressure and make a higher vacuum? 


This is an aspirator I had in mind:

It says at 1.5 gallons per minute, this achieves a vacuum of 700 mmhg which is about what I want, except I only move .5 gallons per minute.

16,"Industry view on ""jack of all trades"" and job prospects?",1534127504,"Hello,

I am a masters student in materials science and engineering who has one more semester left for graduation. I will try to keep my story as short as possible, so, please bear with me.

I completed an undergraduate degree in Nanotechnology and during that time, I realized that I did not want to get into research. The academic fight to simply publish papers without the aim to create practical products just did not make sense to me. I did not want to diverge too much from my undergraduate degree, so I ended up pursuing a course based masters degree in materials science, where I focus on additive manufacturing. I go to school at Carnegie Mellon, and here I got exposed to the power and prospects of machine learning and data science. 

For the past 3 months, I have been teaching myself programming and the basics of ML and I will be taking a few courses on applied ML next semester. As a result of jumping around fields, I kind of ended up being a ""jack of all trades"". I do believe that I am a good engineer in the sense that I can draw on the knowledge from these different fields to find creative solutions to problems (but, then again, that is personal judgment). While the long-term (~ 3- 5 years from now) plan is to start my own start-up, I do need a job upon graduation because I want to gain some experience plus I have student loans that I need to pay off before working on my own projects. 

I have been very anxious of late, because I am worried that my varied are a red flag to industry recruters. I have been told that the industry does not respect people who are interested in a variety of fields as opposed to having laser like focus for one dicipline.

31,Problem with a heat pump,1534083787," Hello,

I have ran into a bit strange problem. There is a 7kW heating capacity geothermal heat pump with R410A refrigerant, which heats DHW up to 45 deg. celsius, or 113 deg. fahrenheit, later el. heater finishes the job.

The problem is that when dhw temperature is about 42\*C (107\*F), refrigerant temperature coming to condenser is 70\*C (158\*F) and compressor pressure is only about 22 bar. (319 psi).

For this cycle condensing temperature should be about 50\*C (122\*F) and pressure about 30 bar (435 psi).

Pressure low, compressor temp high, so first thought is lack of refrigerant. Tried adding some and temperature goes up together with pressure. Discharge temperature should drop, when adding refrigerant if there was not enough of it. So it got pressure up to 25 bar, but tempereture rised up to 80\*C.

Then I stopped heat pump, with this additional refrigerant a bit later when I started again the pressure kept going up to almost 40 bars, so I stopped heat pump immediately (EEV was open, so it must be too much of refrigerant), pulled out some refrigerant and started normally again, but the pressure still too low for condensing temperature.

Basically, when the switch is is to the left, it hides the 230V label and the 115V label is visible. Does this mean that it is set to 115V or that it’s set to 230V. My mind says that 230V is on the left, so pushing the switch left sets it to 230V. However, then it seems the PSU doesn’t advertise the current voltage, as it’s being hidden.

Here’s a pic for reference: http://www.mpja.com/images/18367-2.jpg. It’s not the exact same model, but the switch is the same.

The general advice I have heard is switching jobs every few years, is the best way to make more money, and stick with the same employer is the worst.  However, my experience seems to be the complete opposite.

So I'm about to go into my fourth year of Electrical Engineering. For the past 3 years I didn't put in the work to really do well in my courses and focused on just passing hence my GPA of 2.5. Also, due to some bad decisions I also wasn't able to secure any internships. 
But anyways, recently I've been thinking about what happens after I graduate and I'm pretty scared. Time has flew by the past 3 years and I don't feel like it's slowing down anytime soon. I feel like this year will be my 'make it or break it' year. 
I plan on striving to do well this year but I don't feel like I've learned anything the past 3 years. I know bits and pieces of everything but I don't feel like I remembered much from my previous classes, so when the prof says something that I should have learned, I cant recall it. 
Also, looking at the job postings I get pretty overwhelmed since I don't even know what a quarter of the things companies list in the requirements section and I question if I can do any of the jobs. 

Anyways I feel like I've just been rambling but my main question is what should I be doing when the next semester starts. I plan on specializing into power, so I enrolled into : Energy Systems and Management, Power Electronics, Power Systems and Control Systems. 
But what should I do outside of these classes? I do plan on trying to join a club but I don't know if it's worth it. I feel like I should also learn autoCAD as it seems that companies require me to know it. (I don't know if anyone has a good guide to learn it but much appreciated if you can link). 

Is there anything I should be learning? Should I focus on fully grasping the concepts of all my classes? Is it bad I don't really know anything from the previous years, and should I relearn the material? 

Thanks for any help in advance! :)

EDIT: Just wanted to say thanks for all the input guys! I plan on doing alot of the things you guys have mentioned.

Out of all this I've only gotten two phone interviews, and out of that I was ghosted by the first company and rejected from the second.

I'm not picky about whether the role is strictly aerospace, I'm willing to take on a mechanical or test engineering role, and I'll relocate anywhere in the US. I am worried about my AE designation being a disadvantage with ME roles, but I took structural/FEA electives, and I've used ANSYS FEA in my researcher role and done MATLAB and Python code for finite elements. I also did a lot of verification and validation work on satellite hardware.

22,Should I take a year off between undergrad and grad school?,1533902420,"I'm thinking of taking time off after finishing undergrad for two reasons:

1. I have a non-serious injury/condition of both shoulders, but I've had it for a long time and it's slowly gotten worse. It can only be fixed by surgery.

2. If I wait a year to apply to grad school, I could get in more research experience during senior year to improve my application - am I mistaken about this?

I know I'm expected to be working during this gap year, but I'm concerned about my employability since I will only have one arm for a several-month period (shoulders can only be operated on one at a time, with months in between each). How should I go about finding work?

The third option is to get surgery right now - which is what I would do in an ideal world. Unfortunately, I’m entering my junior year soon with no internship/work experience and not much on my resume (I know...), so I don't think now is a good time to have it.

23,Help with selection of fasteners,1533901478,"Hi folks,

I'm at the last stage of engineering a sliding aluminum track which will be held down by bolts. I've selected a #10-24 x 2in size machine screw but am having a hard time selecting a bolt grade. I have some questions I'm hoping someone can answer;

1. Is #10-24 common enough that it can be found at hardware stores? Any reason to consider 10-32 (fine thread)?

2. Four grades available; 18-8, 316, zinc plated, black oxide plated. I read somewhere that stainless will corrode aluminum. Should I go with zinc plated then? It's about 1/4 of the price of 18-8...

3. Is there a significant difference between 18-8 and 316 in terms of corrosion resistance? The final application will be for mounting on boats, but without saltwater.

4. What sort of clearance should I account for in my countersunk holes to ensure these are flush when fastened?

27,Voltage drop in NPN transistor,1533887876,"Hey,

I've been testing out the following NPN transistor. [https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/BSS138NH6433XTMA1/BSS138NH6433XTMA1CT-ND/](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/BSS138NH6433XTMA1/BSS138NH6433XTMA1CT-ND/)

Basically, the issue I'm having is that I have 3V hooked up to source, but I'm only seeing around 2.3V in drain. Based on what I've been reading, I think this voltage drop is because of the resistance between drain and source.

The application I'm using has a resistance of 100ohm - so ignoring the transistor (if I simply hook the application up to the 3V batteries) I have a current V = I \* R = 3/100 = 30 mA. The issue is, that I hook this up the transistor, I would only see 2.3/100 = 23mA, which is a over 20% drop.

I figured the voltage drop would be much lower - eg if you look at the  data sheet (on page 2 of [https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-BSS138N-DS-v02\_86-en.pdf?fileId=db3a304330f68606013104d944d53efb](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-BSS138N-DS-v02_86-en.pdf?fileId=db3a304330f68606013104d944d53efb)) it says the drain source on state resistance V^(GS)=4.5 V, I^(D)=0.03 A is between 3.3 and 4 ohms. I figured I could just use V = I \* R to get the voltage drop here, so I would do V = .03 \* 4 = .12V. So I thought initially that my drain would only be .12V lower than my source (eg 2.88V instead of 3V)

Why would I be seeing such a large dropoff, and is there a quick fix? Can I just buy a npn transistor with a smaller resistance between drain and source? Also, is my math wrong, or maybe I mismeasured the voltage difference irl?

28,Management at Big Defense Contractor vs Engineering at a Top Silicon Valley Tech Company?,1533880667,"I am in the incredibly fortunate position of deciding between two great offers, and having to make the decision has been driving me crazy. I am a recent college graduate (PhD,EE) and am having a really hard time figuring out which of two routes is a better starting point to kick off my career. My 5 year goal is to transition into a technical leadership role at a big tech company (Apple, Google, etc).

Option A: Technical Management training program at a top 5 defense contractor. This is a great opportunity to get exposure to non-engineering roles (PM, strategy, learn about corporate culture, etc.), and pays fairly well starting. Its a 3 year rotational program, and I think I have a pretty good shot at a manager role after those 3 years at the company. My only hesitation is that I am not sure that defense is an exciting industry in the long-term, and I am worried that engineering management experience in a defense company wont be respected if I will ever want to transition to Silicon Valley tech companies.

Option B: A pure engineering role at a top 5 software company in Silicon Valley. Although there is no clear path into management with this route, it seems to me like it might be easier getting a technical leadership position by working my way up over several years from within. It is probably also important to stay up to date with the cutting edge, and I am worried that jumping directly into management in a defense company will hurt me in the long run as somebody running a team of engineers. This option also pays literally twice as much...

35,Graduate role difficulties (need advice),1533865582,"So I'm in a bit of a pickle here...

I currently work as a workshop assistant at a young (part-time), small technological company within the city which is close to where I live. I have recently completed my MPE in Mechanical Engineering and currently applying for graduate roles. So the problem is that I really want to find a full-time position as a graduate, however my progression at my current workplace will be slow and I would need to wait another 6+ months until they MAYBE offer me a graduate engineering role.

The thing is, there are other student engineers (two) at my workplace who are also aspiring to achieve a graduate role and I know for a fact that only one of us would progress after 6+ months. They still have another semester to go and by the time they finish, we all would be due for a progress review. The tasks that I do are extremely dull and stressful at times and which is why I have been actively looking for other opportunities. 

I have applied to a few companies, one of which I have an interview this Monday (Company A), another where I have a good feeling that I might also be offered an interview since I have a friend who works there (Company B), however, I don't know when I'll hear back since I applied a few days ago. The thing is, Company A is located quite far (35-40 minute drive) which is the only downside. Company B at is only a 10 minute bus ride away and it's where I really want to be at. 

I'm not sure what to do at this stage because if I'm successful at achieving a role for Company A and then later get an offer for an interview at Company B then possibly be offered a role there, things could get awkward. Any advice is appreciated and I know for certain that I do not want to stay at my current workplace.

I wanted to build an air cleaner/purifier, there's a lot of examples online, but we don't have the box fans and those wide filters that you see most projects use. I had to save up money for a floor fan, so in the meantime I made a small air cleaner (~30x30cm) of an old table fan (Ø23cm, 30W, 804m³/h), and some ventilation filters that I cut and folded to have more surface area.  
I know the small one works because it draws air from the back, through the filters, and air moves forward as it normally would (but slightly less).

I started making the big one:  
https://i.imgur.com/IcI621A.jpg

When using the new fan (Ø40cm, 140W, 6000m³/h), before putting in the box and adding filters, it moved a lot of air even on the lowest speed , but afterwards no air is moving forward.

I watched this video (linked to relevent part) to see where to put the front:  
https://youtu.be/FAkM4W_9aC8?t=374

Looking around, I saw fans online that had a cone or duct around them and I thought that would help so I made one:  
https://i.imgur.com/Qq5HjPr.jpg

That does help slightly, but the air is still not moving forward (a lot); in fact it goes to the sides of the box and moves the curtains you see the behind it.  
I thought about extending the duct, but before that I did the test you see in the video (and came here to ask) and the air isn't drawn into the sides, but I discovered that it's drawn into the center of the fan.

Even though I have the filters in the back, I would like to be able to use it normally, with air moving forward, and I was expecting it to work that way since the smaller one did (though the smaller one has a round dome in the center of the blades).  
What should I do?

62,Is Engineering Right for Me?,1533752874,"I hope career advice is accepted on this forum.

27 years and I have bounced around a few jobs here in the US of A, from helpdesk support to network engineering for small businesses. I have a liberal arts degree (I had no vision in college) and am working on a CCNA Routing and Switching certification.

I realize now the ideal job would force me to use high level analytical skills but not trap me at a desk all day. I am interested in pursuing a network engineering career, but know I would be more interested in designing and building the products I work with (Firewalls, Routers, etc.) which I believe would be mechanical E and eventually doing more creative E.

A Few Questions:

1. Can you be a self taught engineer with certificates? Networking is fairly easy to learn from reading off the internet. There are programs and certificates to draw from, and as long as you are studious, you don't need a college degree to be a Network Engineer. I never liked school because I always felt like I was paying through the nose for information I could find online. Is there a path to mechanical engineering jobs that don't require a degree?
2. What is being an engineer like? Again, a good combination for me would be desk retardant but requiring plenty of analytical skills (some weeks of desk time is ok as long as I have similar field times).
3. How compatible is an engineering career with ADHD (not hyperactive)?
4. Is engineering pretty friendly to ladies in the US?
5. Is there anything to consider that I am not thinking of?

69,How can I actively speed up the evaporation of water in a metal box inside?,1533740735,"I saw a video where dissolving ammonium chloride made water cold. I want to make myself a little portable reusable cold pack. I plan to have a metal container (like a liquor flask, but with a door on the side for more water surface area--like a small metal Oreo package) filled with some ammonium chloride powder, and if I want to cool down I just add some water and shake. From googling, if I evaporate the water I can reuse the leftover salt and repeat, right?



With that in mind, what would be the best way to quickly evaporate water, while remaining indoors? I say metal flask thinking metal = thermally conductive, but I'm sure there are other better materials and form factors. I'm open to using electricity too-- doesn't have to be a passive evaporation.





Random thoughts, many questions:



* more surface area = more evaporation. Would a mesh thingy that promotes droplets forming help? Would activated carbon mixed in the solution increase surface area?


* Would a porus material like terra cotta, like in an evaporative cooler, evaporate faster? Would the ammonium chloride leak out of the terra cotta since it is porus?


* looked into vacuum evaporation but the loud pump is something I'd like to avoid. Is there a way to DIY a vacuum evaporator that is small or quiet?


* Distillation seemed like a decent idea but the wiki says chem sublimes when heated so I feel like this might not work out too well.

Condensing:45C 

Evaporating: -40C

1+2-Indicate Fan Speed: Low-Medium-High for the indicated air flow rate.

So my question about this point: we use medium speed for say offices, okay but doesn't the selected model work on the three speeds? For example: 50L/s 150L/s and 300L/s (at L,M,H) why should I select the machine based on the this speed if there was another model with 100L/s at low speed and say 200 at medium speed. Shouldn't I go to the second model rather than the first model? Or does each machine come with a specified speed?

3- Indicate the coil entering dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures?

Does this mean the air dry bulb/wet bulb temperatures??? is it the same as the designed air temperature outside? If machine had a temperature of  32 degrees C and my air temperature is 38 or 29? Does this mean for 38 the cooling load increases and for 29 cooling load decreases. So I should select a machine with entering temperature bigger or equal to my temperature?

4-Check total load and sensible loads by machine? 

Okay, so there's a water flow rate specification this would also control the load. Assume I found one 5kw exactly equals my designed load but my flow rate is 0.4 kg/s whereas the machine flow rate is 0.3 or 0.5 kg/s? How will this affect my selection??

I do however have a large violet of material that the vessel will be machines from so I can leave extra material on the outer diameter. So my question is really how deep will the HAZ penetrate?

39,How on earth does one acquire domain knowledge from an industry one wants to engineer stuff for?,1533655170,"**Background:** I'm interested in how tech can help us grow food better ('smart/precision agriculture', vertical/urban farming etc). I have a bunch of relevant technical skills which can be applied to solving framers' problems and I would be excited to do so, even if that involves starting my own venture some time along the way in the future. I'm in no rush - still quite early into my career (worked for 2 years, now doing a Masters) and I want to steer myself in the right direction.

**Problem:** I don't have enough awareness of the field (pun definitely intended) to actually know the spectrum and nature of the problem farmers face. I need more domain knowledge.

**The options I see (and the problems with them):** 

* **Find work at a company doing tech in the domain of interest** - I'd absolutely do that if it wasn't for the fact that companies in AgriTech looking for my skill set weren't so rare. Moreover, those seem to be usually start-ups, only actively recruiting once they've grown enough to need expert knowledge - which as a noob I obviously don't have.
* **Work in a random company developing my tech skill set while reading about the domain of interest** - unfortunately there is only that much one can learn from keeping a pulse on the industry. News and press releases tend to be very superficial, academic literature seems to be hardly practically relevant and domain-specific reading (e.g. books for farmers) seem to contain mostly already-existing solutions rather than make evident the existing problems and potential for improvement. Also, what motivates me in technology development is mostly the applications of the technology and less so the tech itself. Over the years I've realised I'd be much happier doing soft-engineering rather than hard-engineering, so I have little interest in going down the route of spending years of my life becoming a tech wizard with a long unix beard and only then use the many-years of my (supposed) love for software development to, only incidentally, help agriculture.
* **Abandon tech work for a while and go and work in the industry of interest** - seems like a bit of overkill and potentially a tech career suicide, given I'm quite early into my tech development and there is a lot I still need to learn if I'm to ever feel confident enough to lead creation of new tech solutions.
With 'smart' and 'precision agriculture' becoming more and more things one reads about I know for a fact my skills can be valuable in that field (pun very much intended). The thing is I have close to no idea what are some of the concrete and exact problems farmers face that need solving!

So yeah, I see problems with pretty much any option I help and the fact that I don't have much people to brainstorm it with definitely doesn't help. I'd be interested to hear what /r/AskEngineers thinks about all of this and if there is any wisdom/experience of people moving between fields.

Industrial processes where product standing in tubing is lossage.,1533614851,"Getting ambitious with a garage brew setup... homebrew is 200 gallons per year per household, so I've got my friends interested who would get the hardware when I'm done. I could just start my operation 10 feet in the air but the framework, assembly, and transport moving it would be a massive pain in the ass over a frame that I can load and unload from the back of my pickup.

I've got a large pressurized vessel of liquid at height A, and one at height B. I was told that it's trivial to rig up a pressure assist with food-grade Nitrogen. The reality I've found is that gas will bubble past the liquid when you've got just liquid in the vertical tubing. Thus, every push I'm losing product in the lines, and with tubing of diameter and height in play it's actually a decent volume of lossage. What occurs to me is this is a real engineering problem in real industries and there's probably a real solution for this. This should be happening in... dairy? Brewing? Essential oils? At some point, it has to be shut down and flushed, and anything stagnant in the lines is lost. So a large operation stands to lose a lot when it shuts down for that but that might not be significant compared to the total product throughput between cycles. But a smaller home operation which does smaller batches and shuts down frequently for cleaning, I stand to lose some 6-packs which is significant to me.

I'd think a cheap vacuum pump to evacuate the recipient vessel would help? Might not be an option for microbrew since it would screw with carbonation, but I don't know what the real solution is here.

I am a recent grad from an environmental engineering program from a major university in California. Lately I've been applying to various civil/environmental positions around my area, but I have been unsucessful as of late due to my interviewing skills and lack of depth in certain areas that I simply didn't specialize in during school. But originally, my specialization in undergrad was more geared towards mechanical engineering (HVAC energy analysis, Building efficiency analysis, Solar PV feasibility analysis). And that was where I wanted to go career wise but given how crappy some of the design classes were and the lack of technical depth my interest withered away but I realized my interest alined more with doing thermal fluid system design after doing some self study for a summer. But by the time I came to this realization, I only had two semesters left, so there was no point in me transferring to a mechanical engineering program. And in addition, I wanted to graduate on time so I was indirectly forced to take some civil engineering courses that were gears more towards water resources.  I never truly had an interest in civil engineering and always detested being forced into those courses BUT THEN my capstone project (*that you dont get to decide) has forced me into this field (Since most employers want to know about your capstone project.)! My capstone project ended up being a civil engineering project that I seriously had no interest in and barely any background knowledge to complete at the time. 

Now I want to go to grad school and specialize in thermal/fluids and in addition get my PE license in mechanical (thermal fluids). Since currently even though I have multiple fluid mechanics, some electronics, and some thermodynamics design courses under my belt, I still don't have the required skill-set or experience to have a job in this career field. But I didn't have the funds to go to grad school this year so I decided to work for this year and go next fall. But is this the right path to go? I'm not guaranteed that I will get a engineering job at all. Should I just try to develop my skill set on my own without going to grad school even though my degree is jn environmental engineering? Will employers accept that? I just wanted some experience before I go to grad school but the only type of experience available in my area is water resources/ transportation engineering positions. And I don't have the money or connections as a recent grad to relocate in order to get a job that I would prefer to specialize in. Nor do I have family support. I just don't know what to do with my life at this point since I'm in this dilemma of being pigeon -holed into a career field I never wanted to be in and living in an area that doesn't have jobs in the career field I want to be in. I currently have a minimum wage job.

tl;dr: I know what I want to specialize (Thermal Fluid Systems) in but I don't know how to get there with my current credentials, experience, money, and lack of connections.

We are a european company but I work at a facility in the south in the US. 

This is why i am concerned: The last engineering presentation i made went really well from my group's perspective, but it was in an academic setting.  We got full credit on everything but our professor took 15/100 pts off because we were laughing and having a good time while presenting.  We made a few well-timed off the cuff jokes and got the class laughing a few times.  I admit we went a little overboard and I understand why our prof dropped us an entire letter grade plus some.

86,Informations on converting single hose air conditioner to a dual hose,1533559914,"Hey guys,

Just wanted to share my experience about converting a single hose mobile air conditioner to a dual hose one as older topics here are talking about it.

I wanted to do it because I realized after i bought my single hose ac (model supra blizair 3000) that when put on an air sealed opening on my window it would create a negative pressure effect in my room as the ac was pushing the room air outside and no outside air was compensating this.

As a result of this negative pressure the outside hot air would push to come into the room, making the ac useless.

So the goal of adding a second hose was to allow the outside air to be sucked in to cool the condensor then exit by the original exhaust hose.

It did not work because single hose ac are not designed to be air sealed so even if you put a second hose on the air intake there are still air sucked from your room and exhausted outside, creating a negative pressure effect in the room which forces the outside air back and makes the ac useless.

I tried to open the ac up to see if I could make the hot part air sealed myself but the compressor is so close to the condensor that it would require to cut the circuit open to move the compressor away from the condensor to be able to do that. The price of the needed tools, the gas refill and the time it would take are not worth the mod so instead of throwing it up I just gave the ac to a frigorist for free as they do have the needed tools and i bought a dual hose ac (could not install split in my appartment) which has air sealed condensor space so it works perfectly.

You can see all the pictures I took when opening the ac when i was trying to mod it here (hosted on my private web server): [https://ah1z.com:4443/owndoge/index.php/s/guU6V10UhRsI3bR#﻿](https://ah1z.com:4443/owndoge/index.php/s/guU6V10UhRsI3bR#﻿) (you can click on the top right to get a gallery view).

System B: can do 100.000 *teraFLOPS*

System B: runs at 50.00 °C 

System A: PCB trace impedance tolerance 0.013%

System B: PCB trace impedance tolerance 0.007&amp;

Would an Identical AI behave slightly differently if ran on each system?

would the AI on system A possibly perform an action quicker, or predict an outcome more favorably or more pessimistic versus the B system?

Would one AI prefer the color green more than the other one due to the assembly, production and tolerance differences in the physical computing system? similar to how hormones and brain chemistry makes us behave differently.

my guts tell me that since nothing is 100% efficient, especially our current technological advancements and production, how can an AI perform identically with the same ""psychological"" properties and profile?

96,Good work-life balance MechE jobs/industries in New Jersey/Greater NYC Area? (40 hours a week and no more unless there's overtime pay),1533525561,"So summary about me: I graduated from school last year in May 2017 with a BSME, purely motivated by my love of cars and racing as a hobby. Couldn't move to mid-west/Detroit area due to a significant other I would like to eventually marry, winded up taking a job as an Engineer in the automotive aftermarket. Turned out that working in the aftermarket is really just measuring crap quality parts from China to make sure it'll fit on the car. If our competitors drop price and quality, we drop quality and price too.

 Needless to say, this entire sector of the industry doesn't mesh well with my personal values and I'm not getting the opportunity to grow as an engineer either. I literally just approve prints and handle some logistics -no design work, no technical problem solving, and the most hands-on thing I do is handle a caliper. Overall, the job is making me miserable, I'm still 2 hours away from my girlfriend, and the pay is mediocre at 60k a year (no OT or bonus) and no annual raise (which historically is only 2.5-3 % according to some coworkers when the company isn't a financial mess). Maybe this is where I'm being a spoiled millennial, but my engineering friends at other companies like Honda and my girlfriend (also a mechE but in construction) already hit a 6% pay bump after working for 10 months (also fresh out of school) so that is also making me want to leave.

\*TLDR\*

**The only redeeming factor with the job so far is that it is a true 40 hour workweek. So my question is, what other companies/industries with mechanical engineering opportunities in the Northern/Central NJ/greater NYC area have a good work life balance like this?** 

 I have specific interests in material analysis/failure, vehicle dynamics, anything with wheels, and anything that's really ""hands-on"". I know that's cliche, but honestly I would have became a mechanic if they were able to make 60k with zero years of experience. I do like the ""forensic"" part of my current role, where I have to determine if our part failures were the result of being crap quality or the car itself had issues that caused premature failure, but that's a pretty small part of the job.

97,Paid an E a $1000 to create simple circuit using nano-timer. Hopelessly let down.,1533524329,"The goal of this project was to create a timer so that when a button is pressed, 3V is sent from two AA batteries to an electromagnet. After 1 hour, the timer is supposed to shut off power to the electromagnet, only to regain power when the switch is pressed again. I have a PCB with the following components: 124kOhms resistor (this is to allow the nano-timer to time for 1 hr), TPL5111 nano-timer, n-channel transistor, a 3V power supply (2 AA batteries), a switch, and an electromagnet. I have drawn the circuit and attached in the link below.

Sometimes the circuit works as intended, but recently I have experienced it where the 3V is constantly supplied to the electromagnet and never shuts off. Here is my understanding of the current circuit and how it should work, but is not. Pin 1 is connected to the batteries. Pin 2 is connect to a 124kOhm resistor and then to Pin 3. Pin 3 is also connected to a switch that is connected to the positive end of the batteries. Pin 4 is grounded. Pin 5 is connected to the Gate of the transistor. Pin 6 is connected to ground because we want the nano-timer to be in ""one-shot mode"". The Gate of the transistor is to Pin 5. The Source is to the batteries and the Drain is to one end of the electromagnet. The other end of the electromagnet is to ground. 

This current dilemma I am facing is extremely troublesome because the worst case scenario is occurring and that is that the electromagnet stays engaged for an infinite amount of time (til the batteries die). I don't understand how Pin 5 (DRV pin of the nano-timer) is staying high for over 1 hr (even over 2 hrs, thought that was the absolute max for this type of nano-timer), thus resulting in Gate being constantly high and Drain constantly powering the electromagnet. If someone could please help explain how this is possible, how this nano-timer can have Pin 5 be high for an infinite amount of time,  and what possible failure modes could cause the electromagnet to be constantly powered, that would be greatly appreciated!

99,looking for some kind of off the shelf tension adjustment device for a film scanner,1533516600,"I'm building a motion picture film scanner. It will have a simple transport from the feed to the takeup reels that looks similar to this design being used by  the open source Kinograph project: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DtXLO2K-Uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DtXLO2K-Uw)

However, rather than using spring loaded tension hubs as kinograph does, I'd like to use a single roller on a linear actuator, that adjusts position dynamically based on the tension on the film itself. Something like what the MWA Spinner scanner uses: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NugH6zdXVmw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NugH6zdXVmw)

I'm doing this because my scanner will be able to work with multiple gauges of film, and each has different tension requirements. In order for the kinograph design to work with multiple gauges, you'd need to swap the springs with each format change. I don't want to have to do that. Also, film with lots of splices in it requires less tension so I want to be able to control that from software as needed.

In this video of the MWA scanner, it's a roller on the lower left side of the scanner deck that's got about a foot of travel. I don't know what the mechanism is that they're using, but I'm guessing it's more sophisticated than a simple spring - some kind of load cell to read the tension and then something to adjust the roller position up and down as needed

Question is - can I buy something like this pre-made? Mine is a one-off scanner so I'm willing to spend a little money on it since it'll save a ton of time in trying to engineer it myself (my background is in film, and while I've built a scanner or two, they've mostly been modifications of existing machines so I didn't have to do this kind of mechanical engineering from scratch).

Second and this is a less burning question, but how exactly do prions spread? I don't understand how a protein being misfolded can cause another protein to then bend out of shape through interacting.

I have the option between Electrical Engineering, Information Technology and Computer Engineering [B.Sc](https://B.Sc) ([http://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bkuh?lidx=1#aaaaaaaaaaabkui](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bkuh?lidx=1#aaaaaaaaaaabkui)) and Business Administration and Engineering, Specialization Electrical Power Engineering ([http://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bmmx?lidx=1#aaaaaaaaaaabmmy](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bmmx?lidx=1#aaaaaaaaaaabmmy)) (links provided if you want to check those out).

I believe that the second course is more like the German version of industrial engineering, apparently it's the ""connection"" between engineers and business people.

**What I'm striving for in my future career is one with a path of promotion offers.** I don't mean that in the sense of the job with easy promotions, but the one with more positions in which I can climb into with hard work.  From reading through some other topics on this sub, am I correct in saying that the highest position for electrical engineers is Senior Engineer. On the other hand, studying business and engineering (The course material is about 45/55 with slight inclination to technical aspects) seems to give me the ability to reach higher positions in management.

**The biggest influences of my choice of subject is largely job prospects and wage.** To be honest, I'm not completely sure as to what kind of work I want to do (Although every source of info seems to be telling me to follow my seemingly non-found passion). No subject at school stood out for me, but I'm the type that can put my mind to whatever I have to do and get results.

**So what do you, as people with experience reckon?** I am planning on studying till Masters in whatever subject I choose (unless some heavenly force offers me a job at the end of my Bachelors). **Will it be better to specialize in one area, hence EE degree, or become a sort of specialist in both the areas of Business and Electrical Power Engineering?**

44,"Critique my ""fire proof"" house concept",1533358006,"Here is the concept:

The house is built on a platform which is lowered when a fire is approaching the area, for example when evacuation orders are mandated. Prior to leaving the home, the homeowners will detach the electricity, gas line, water, and sewer lines etc. Some locking pins are removed from the home and then a hydraulic lift will lower the home underground. A sliding latch system with a heat resistant material will be moved over the top of the underground structure. The surrounding above-ground surface area will consist mostly of gravel/non-flammable type materials. A simple heat dissipation unit will be above ground as the fire engulfs the surrounding forest lands/brush lands.

After the fire has passed the home is lifted back to its original position, all utility connects are reconnected.

This concept is for homes in dense forest areas that are prone to fires, not for suburban homes/tract homes.

48,How bad is Trump fucking you?,1533343296,"I have something to get off my chest...

I work in the heavy equipment industry and Trump is royally fucking my company in the ass bareback without any lube.We source parts from all over the world, but the lames ass tariffs on China have lead to the following:

1. All of the parts that we source from China are currently unprofitable and there are no U.S. companies willing to make the same parts because they are too busy or the parts are too complicated (i.e. it's not a square plate).
2. The price of steel/aluminum/zinc has gone full on retard. We can't build anything in the U.S. or overseas and make a profit.
3. The handful of U.S. suppliers who are willing to make parts are price gouging. They are charging 3-4x what they would have a year ago and we have quotes for the same parts to prove it.
4. Because of 1-3, we have been unable to move product for 2 months now and we are basically keeping afloat by not spending money so we can avoid raising prices.
5. Because of #4 there are many people on the chopping block about to lose their jobs because of a bullshit situation that is out of their control.

I know the majority of people are going to respond to this by saying ""buy American"" or ""Made in the USA"", but get your head out of your ass...this is a global economy and parts are made where it makes sense to make them. Also, from what I've seen in the past 10 years, the U.S. suppliers are quickly falling behind European and Asian suppliers on quality and volume.

I hate to say it, but another issue that we have is that American workers are lazy as fuck and the chance of moving things back to the U.S. is pretty much non-existent. The best workers we have in our factory are immigrants but it's not because of pay, it's because they are actually willing to work and they take pride in the work they do.

My question is, can someone point me in the right direction of where I can get a scientific understanding of the pressure requirements for properly moulding objects? The only info I have found so far lists tremendous pressure but no specific scientific formulas, while other ""hobbyists"" seem to think that pressure is somewhat irrelevant, but I assume that a visual inspection really does not suffice because the material properties are determined at the molecular level (which would be affected by things like pressure, temperature, setting time, cooling rate, etc...). The most extreme example, of course, is diamonds which get their properties from extreme pressure.

85,"Which engineering degree for NASA, SpaceX, Raytheon, Blue Origins, etc.?",1533248249,"I am a new student about to under-go my first year at a university. My dream would be to work for one of the companies or organizations listed above (Mainly NASA or SpaceX). I am current enrolled as an Aerospace Engineering major, with a focus on Astronautics (Space). Since its my first year, and majority of the classes aren't specialized changing a major shouldn't be too detrimental. Another passion is electrical engineering, but I am not sure about the frequency at which they are hired, and all of the projected growth from google is from 2014 (including aerospace engineering projected growth). The internet Even says that jobs in aerospace are projected to drop 2% in the next decade; however with the happening with SpaceX, the Hype about Mars, and NASAs new SLS, I think it would grow, would it not? I am considering changing my major to electrical engineering (obviously they would be very useful in developing new systems or even future propulsion), or to mechanical engineering, as everyone needs mechanical engineers. 

I know that these places hire all types of engineers, as building a rocket, probe, or shuttle takes expertise from all disciplines of engineering. From what I understand, Aerospace Engineers would handle propulsion, aerodynamics, and thermodynamics (like heat dissipation).

So now the actual questions, so this isn't me just venting.

1) Is it safe to assume that a degree in aerospace engineering wont be a waste of four years and scholarships? Basically can I rely on jobs being open?

2) If not Aerospace Engineering, what degree would increase my chances of working on craft that exit Earths Atmosphere. I.e. rockets, probes, landers, anything having to do with space.

3) Is it worth the trouble of double majoring in engineering programs (aero and electrical or mechanical)? Is it worth sacrificing the time I spend Networking, and trying to get my name in the heads of hiring managers?

4)  My school (like many) allows me to peruse a minor in Physics, so would it be beneficial to do declare a minor in that?

Thank you for any answers you may have, or any resources to allow me to find the answers myself.

87,Designing a planetary gear clock,1533241236,"Hello everyone,

I am currently designing a watch mechanism and ran into a bit of an issue. I was hoping I could get some guidance or ideas from someone with more experience as this is my first project out of university. 

Without going into the whole design, the watch mechanism will basically be a compound planetary gear set, with at least 3 sets mounted in series. I need the rings to serve as outputs for seconds, minutes and hours respectively. 
I will post more details when I get to the office tomorrow but the main thing is the gear set needs to be 3D printable at least in its prototyping stage and it will be used as a desk object so sizes can vary according to what's needed for the gear train. 

At the moment, I calculated the first two sets using an input from a motor of 9 rpm (can be easily changed if needed). The first set gives me seconds (1 rpm), the second is used as a reduction to get me closer to the 1/60 rpm I need for the minute display. My issue is that I am not sure if I am going in the right direction with this or not. Any advice is highly appreciated.

I am writing a book and need to identify some high level troubleshooting techniques. This is stuff that can apply to any kind of project, from IT to manufacturing.

I want to be sure I have a pretty good full list of techniques here to try on things after they break. My book is about bringing things back onto their feet.

High-level troubleshooting techniques:

- **What else isn’t working and when?** - look for connected symptoms and disruptions

- **Define working as designed** - make sure the defect is true, and not a missing requirement or assumption

- **Break something else** - to confirm processes as functioning, and to isolate sub-processes that may not be functioning

- **Forcing positives and negatives** - run data or samples through the system to ensure consistency, either positive or negative

- **Walk-through the problem together** - level set understanding on what does what, and how functions and features interact

- **Trace Steps Backwards** - find out where things degrade

- **Reverse the design** - tackle component performance by deconstructing elements and features

- **Perform an environment comparison** - helps to rule out foundational issues

- **Isolate or Replicate a problem or portion of the problem in another environment** - provides both negative and positive validations and helps confirm theories with root cause

What would be the cheapest solution to this that would be practical without laser-cutters, cnc machines, etc. to build gearing? He'd prefer not to spend much more than £20 as it would literally only be used on those few days. I don't know if that's possible, but surprise me!

24,Considering potential career change to engineering. Need some direction.,1533140510,"Preface: this post is going to be long, potentially naive, and very much like a dating profile.

So I am currently a Realtor and auctioneer. Competition is high, only getting fiercer and mark my words, another recession is coming, although not as big as 2008. I like my job alright, but my pay is proportional to the market and it isn't that great right now so I can't imagine what it will be like when the market takes a downturn. I can see myself staying as a small business owner for the rest of my life if I can make this work. However, I'm exploring all options.

I have a bachelor's in public relations/marketing but didn't particularly enjoy that career. The desk work was maniacal and micro management got in the way of a lot of my work and satisfaction. I understand that may have just been where I was working, but the desk life wasn't for me I don't think.

Last year, I bought a 3D printer. I was enamored. I love printing things, tinkering with the machine to make it work more effectively, and even got into designing and implementing things. I designed and printed [this](https://gfycat.com/WarpedInsecureArcticduck) for a competition on a 3d printing community website and it got honorable mention out of a few hundred designs (12th place if you count how they listed the winners from the top). I plan on eventually rigging it to charge a phone. I really enjoyed creating that and felt a good sense of accomplishment once it was finished. I've also enjoyed tinkering with a Raspberry Pi 3 as well as an Arduino. Because of this, I'm eyeing Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering. I could be off here, but that seems to be the best fit for a tinkerer like myself. I am very open to suggestion.

Another issue I have is schooling. There is an EE program about 30 miles from where I live but I don't really care to sit in a classroom OR drive that distance everyday. I am 25 so it's not like I feel too old to be around college students, but I would have to make a living somehow during school and that would not leave a lot of time for me to do so. For this reason, I think an online degree would suit me a little better. I've looked at ASU and a few other options, but I'm also concerned with the time frame. I don't really want to be in school for another 4 years. Are there any programs online that might be up my alley? I know Boston University has a LEAP program for those with a regular bachelor's degree to gain a Masters in EE, but it is a brick and mortar degree. 

Here are a few more questions

1) How well does a career like this coincide with family life? I just got married and we're talking kids in a few years.

2) What does a typical work day look like for an ME and an EE? 

3) I did well in High School, and had a 3.3 GPA in college. However, I did not take any math courses in college. I did get an A in Calculus in high school. Am I going to be able to get through the coursework with a good study/work ethic? Or will I be in over my head?

29,Trouble Deciding How To Secure Components At High Rpm,1533135763,"Hello everyone,

&amp;nbsp;

I'm designing two metal parts that will sandwich a ball bearing. Images can be [found here](https://imgur.com/a/HURB8mM) (bearing missing - when added it will bridge the gap between the two separate pieces without obstructing the central hole).

&amp;nbsp;

The problem I'm facing is finding a way to secure the parts once assembled. Here are my criteria:

- Must be easy to assemble and disassemble 
- Securing components must be contained within the central hole (I can add material, but the larger the diameter of the hole when assembled the better)
- The weight must be the same on either side of the bearing
- Any extra weight from securing parts must be distributed in a way that doesn't induce vibration (part will spin in the 6,000 rpm range)
- Securing parts must be subtle. I'd like the part to have a smooth/clean look once assembled, 

&amp;nbsp;

I have considered having asymmetrical metal parts and adding threads to them, which would allow the two parts to screw directly onto each other. I think this would work, however, I'm not fond of the asymmetric seam this would create where the two metal components meet.

In theory when i de-energise the solenoid it should close the actuator thus shutting the valve.

I believe the problem is the pressure loss is sucking all the air out the valve instead of allowing it into the actuator. Is there any tricks i can do to force the air into the actuator? ",AskEngineers,False,AntiGamerSJW,/r/AskEngineers/comments/93f1zq/plumbing_experts_how_to_close_a_high_pressure/

66,New RF source has significantly reduced signal reception from water meters,1533038169,"Hey all,

I work with a water utility that uses electronic endpoints on its meters which are then picked up by a receiver. A typical coverage radius on these receivers is about one mile and picks up  between 2000 - 5000 endpoints. It looks like a new signal somewhere is blasting on the same frequencies as our endpoints and I'm asking here to figure out if there are any tools available (FCC, triangulation etc.) to find this source to determine its legality.

The other day, I was looking at graphs of receiver performance and noticed that a group of receivers has plummeted from about 3000 endpoints read per day to about 300. This drop occurred across multiple receivers in the same geographical area (five receivers within a two-mile radius) and all occurred at the same time. This tells me its not a hardware issue and that it's interference from another signal.

These are spread spectrum devices in the 910-920MHz range and operate in a 0.1W and 1.0W mode and both signals are getting lost in the noise. Are there legitimate sources that could be drowning out the signals? Could this be an unlicensed transmission?

I was watching an older documentary about the X fighter competition for the JSF, and it showed Boeing going with the Navy method but having a lot of problems engaging and having to bail out, versus the USAF hard boom that seems like it goes right in the tank versus catching an external port. USN have female hose male probe, and USAF has male probe and female receiver on the fighter. 


It seemed like the USAF method worked a lot better. No hose whipping in the wind that could hit instruments, better sealing, and male into female with flow going from M-F seems like it would transfer more volume with no internal contact ledge exposed to fuel flow. 

The only downside I can see with the USAF method is it reunites a boom operator, and in very turbulent weather could make it too dangerous to refuel altogether as that boom would take your plane down if it made bad contact.

1. How difficult do you think it is to get an analysis role with just a BSME?

2. What can I do over the course of my final year to improve my chances of landing such a position?

3. What types of programming languages are the most useful for an analysis position? Will I need to know Numerical Analysis very well?

4. What types of software should I be familiar with? (I've learned FEA in solidworks at school but I know it is not used in industry very much)

5. What advice can you give to an undergraduate that will soon be entering the workforce?

I did my best to follow the rules, and spent a few hours looking for an easy approach to this question, but all I really got was a stones throw from nothing, either going down the extreme physics of aerofoils or looking at what's already out there

**There already appear to be prototypes and designs out there:**

All of the above videos feature electric powered machines, from what I can tell, and that's about all on documentation.

Next in line on the realm of extreme is the completely human-powered flying devices that look straight out of Studio Ghibli,

**While that stuff is nice and all, I'm curious about the physics behind the props:**

*(I'm just a fresh electrical engineer myself, so I promise I'm not completely inept, just \*mostly\*. In any case, pardon my somewhat stream-of-conciseness approach to writing out my points/questions)*

My first instinct upon seeing that straightforward, ""documentation for prop \[size/number/attack angle/shape/etc\],"" wasn't so straightforward, I was about ready to hop into the realm of trial and error. (Well, I was ready, but I'm sure anyone's wallet would not be so gung-ho). That being said, I resigned myself to being content with theory crafting and such; but in order to accurately theory craft, it would be nice to have numbers, or rather, simple equations for how motors manage to produce lift.  
**mini-tldr:** *what are simple equations for ideal turbine lift*

One common concept I took away from all the work that other people is doing: centralized power source, and individual electric motors for the four turbines. These electric motors don't seem to be particularly weighty compared to what I've seen/worked with, but are definitely a step up from hobby-grade RC motors. Imagining the upscaling time of battery size, electric motors, and work output from a simple drone, I also can't imagine these things getting a terribly long battery life either; but I reckon that if I were to slap a seat on some sort of combustion engine, then I'd be better off looking into how to make a gyrocopter (which all appear to be directly connected to the engine - much like a simple helicopter - and attempting to transfer that energy over timing belts or other mechanical forms of energy conversion I can guess would be a nightmare). So yeah, let's assume that we're not some business trying to turn a quick profit. There's bound to be an ideal electric motor size, and subsequently, an ideal central battery size so as to make the bike a not entirely worthless 10 minute ride on a full charge.   
**mini-tldr:** *I guess I too would want to use \[n\] number of electrical motors attached to a centralized battery*

In particular, you can notice with some of the quad-copter bike designs I linked above, they actually have the blades' cylinders overlap. How does this affect the efficacy of the blade sharing in it's immediate vicinity? Or is the resultant chop-chop to the shared atmosphere of little significance for the blades?  
**mini-tldr:** *Are there any funky propeller properties which one should be aware of?*

From all that I can understand as a layman reading about these subjects these engine types are some of the most efficient available. The technology is simple and well understood (at least in the case of the stirling engine) and maintenance is easy with systems potentially operating indefinitely with light maintenance. 
 
There are also a number of configurations that these engines can be configured into to collect energy, fresnel lenses and hyperbolic mirrors are two that come to mind and tracking systems that allow them to follow the sun are identical to any used in [PV cells](http://smartflowersolar.com/) that perform a similar function within the same footprint. What's more storing heat as energy offers the ability to harvest the power in a steadier flow since a heat reservoir will retain energy long after the sun goes down and it allows some of the energy to be rerouted directly to hot water.  
 
PV cells on the other hand, are expensive, have a limited lifespan and appear to be fairly inefficient at what they do. The only real advantage PV cells seem to have is that they can lie flat on roofing. Although that doesn't seem like a particularly challenging problem for stirling engines to work around and I've seen some ideas that address [it](https://www.cnet.com/news/sunflower-solar-concentrator-deemed-safe-for-rooftops/).

I'm planing on testing different 3d printed materials for their usability in a 3d printed gearbox for a brushless motor +-300W. For this I would like to perform some tests, one of them is a stress test to see whether the gears can handle the temperature. To perform this test equally for all gears I'm searching for a way to apply a constant reproducible ""load"" the output gear.

An easy way would be lifting a ""heavy"" load with a string. The problem is I would like to perform this test for a longer time and the length of the string and the height it can be lifted to are for me the limiting factors.

That's why I'm looking to replicate this effect.

* One way could be by placing a DC motor on the output side and using it as a generator, and loading this generator with a constant power load.  *But do I need a constant power load? as the RPM of the motor will stay constant, maybe it's enough to use a power resistor as the load, and by keeping the RPM constant the power will be the same for all cases.*

* Another way could be by making a mechanical brake system but this might be complex as well

I'm trying to make a system with taper lock fastened couplings, but I don't really want to use keys since they'd ruin the balance if I want to keep this thing modular in the sense I can use stiff and flexible couplings, however since time is of the essence right now there's not an option to not use keyless couplings (Too long delivery times for everything which I could use, hence taper locks with keyslots in them)

So what's the best way to balance the system? Using counter weights, such as screws in the couplings on the opposite side of the coupling? Weld equal mass onto the coupling? I'm at bit loss here.. I've gotten this incredible opportunity, but there's really no one I can ask advise at work (Summer vacation + few mechanical engineers working there in the first place) So I'm kinda at loss what to do.

I got asked a question the other day and I think the more experienced engineers may be able to help since I was not sure how this works.


So, PET is inherently insulated with a high surface resistivity &gt;&gt; (1*10^12 ohms).


Therefore, applying conductive ink onto an insulated film should be ok without adding an external coating to PET. My chain of thought is that conductive ink isn't like the inks used for printing but is much easier to apply onto a plastic surface. From what I know in typical printing, adding an external coating of anti-static would lower the dyne level of the surface so inks would not be able to be applied to its surface.

79,360 Brass for food branding?,1532717926,"Good morning,

I had a question/concern I was hoping you all could assist me with. I recently purchased a variable heat iron with 2 custom made stamp heads for the intended purpose of branding hamburger buns for my farther-in-law's BBQs.

After I had ordered, I was questioning whether or not the material was safe for this purpose(they were sold as wood/leather branding irons). After investigation, I learned the material was 360 brass, and contained approx. 2% lead for machining/smelting.

I am wondering if this is at all safe to use? I have found various information, but thought this would be the most reliable consensus. I have heard that heating the brass causes no issues as long as it's not melting, and if not using on anything acidic that could ""leach"" or cause the lead to migrate to the product. Is this correct?

I have also been told to soak them in a 2 part vinegar to 1 part hydrogen peroxide solution for about 5 minutes to ""remove surface lead"" from the brass.

It is dangerous to use these for hamburger buns etc, or do I risk lead poisoning and should discard them or look for Aluminum or Stainless steel options?

I have already purchased(and they were not cheap), so would love to avoid having to ditch them. But if I am putting people at risk, I will accept the outcome and look for other options.

Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

I have a project where I need to move a number of heavy H frames weighing about 1100 lbs each. The trick is that they have to be moved out along the top of a concrete wall that has as little as 16"" clearance. There is a 12' drop of either side at some points. It's a distance of about 300'.

Aside from airlift, I've considered the idea of using a post tower at each end and suspending 1/2"" cable along the distance, attaching a chain hoist on a pulley and moving them that way.

I assume sag will occur and to counter that I'm thinking about using a mobile prop that I could use to lift the cable as we move along. I would lower the weight of the object onto the wall, place the prop and then lift the object again to continue along.

There are tie off points on both ends to secure the cable (think short bollards with a mushroom head).

Any ideas to simply put it on wheels is a problem since if we lose balance, it could be a real disaster. Although I have thought to just use a cable as a guide wire along the top and put it on a rolling platform but I worry is its not suspended, a loss of balaclava would cause a sideways force that too would be an issue.

Firstly, diagram to help explain. Also, this is kinda long, so I apologize for that. 

Hello smart people! I work in surface finishing /electroplating, and this involves the use of electrolytic solutions that need to be circulated during the plating process. This can be accomplished by adjusting pump speeds, but that can be tedious, tricky and annoying

I've been trying to find a way to make this easier and I thought I might be able to work out something similar to the ""which container will fill up first"" pictures floating all over the internet.

The diagram shows my idea, which is flawed somehow (maybe minorly, maybe it's unfeasible - hopefully a smart person can tell me). The goal is to keep the solution level in container B at a constant level. Container A is the key to this (hopefully). The spouts at the bottom of A and B are the same diameter. Since both containers are open to atmospheric pressure, I assumed that the flow from each of them would be the same, and that they would drain equally, keeping B constant as long as fluid remained in A, which is supplied from C, via the pump.

An overflow attached to A would return excess solution back to C, ensuring that A would always have solution in it. I thought that all I would need to do is make sure that the pump had a higher flow rate than A drained, and the rest would work itself out.

Obviously, that isn't the case. I'm finding that B is draining faster than A can supply it, which doesn't make much intuitive sense to me. I understand that the depth of the fluid affects the pressure at the bottom, but the difference is depth is pretty small, maybe an inch or two, and the total fluid in the system is less than a gallon. None of the inlet or outlet spots are submerged, and the containers are open topped, so I shouldn't be pressurizing anything.

I work for a major aerospace/defense contractor. They're huge and they have facilities all over the US. 

I got my first job here out of college. I am about 2 months in and the work is so insanely slow and frankly I am getting bored. I have brought this up with my manager and he said he'll find me work. I approach my coworkers and they say ""I don't know why they're hiring all these guys when there's no work to do."" 

Anyway, **How long did it take for you to actually be occupied and engaged all day at work?** I have literally sat at my desk for hours with nothing to do. I feel bad because I am charging budgets because I am supposed to be there, but THERE IS NO WORK FOR ME!

Over the course of two years, engineers at my plant have been combating both corrosion and constant fouling throughout the high and medium pressure steam system. 

The corrosion issue is currently being attributed to problems with the DA/feed water tank, and changes are being made to help get PPB dissolved gas down to an acceptable level. It appears to be working. 

Fine, great, HOWEVER, we are still seeing tons of fouling of PSVs, traps, etc.  This fouling was originally thought to be from the corroded piping sluffing, but now that corrosion seems to be under control and it’s still happening, we’re not so sure.

39,Challenge from my professor,1532572166,"So my lecturer for my electrical class at uni occasionally hands out challenges “to stimulate the mind and get you  students to think outside the box”. A few weeks ago he gave out this  challenge:

*'Find a way to set up a simple electrical circuit that allows you  to power a single light bulb. Then, with the same circuit, replace the  single light bulb with 10 others, and power them simultaneously.'*

Rules for the circuit:

* You cannot use a variable resistor.
* Each light bulb must be identical.
* The power source must give out consistent power. (ie. If you're using a motor to spin a rotor, the motor must be at a constant speed)

This is my first semester at uni, and I feel like my knowledge is  limited here. The way I see it is that if you can power 1 light bulb,  you don’t have enough power to light up 10. But if you can light up 10,  then that power would pop 1 light bulb. For that reason surely you can’t  just use a battery. Without a variable resistor or power variance, how  can you power two circuits with different loads with the same amount of  power?

EDIT:

I had a classmate come up with something. He had handmade solenoids  (weighing 60grams) set up in a formation similar to what you’d find in a  computer cooling fan. Using that as an alternator (he had a small motor  powering it with a 12V battery), plain copper wires and LEDs from  jaycar he was able to answer the challenge. 

He showed us using a multimeter voltages of 1.5V for a single LED and 1.3V for 10 LEDs, while the current was sitting at 0.11A for both setups. All lights illuminated, although the set of 10 in parallel were dimmer. Now, when he attempted to use handmade coils with more windings  (weighing 120grams so it was significantly larger), he achieved up to 5V  and 0.1A. But he said that popped the single LED and failed to illuminate the 10 LEDs. He claimed the large coils were able to  illuminate up to 8 LEDs, anything more and no light. Could I please get a  possible explanation for this? Shouldn’t there be enough power to  illuminate the 10 LEDs considering the smaller one was able to, AND there was enough power to pop a single LED whereas the other did not?

73,"For maximum acceleration in a car, peak torque or peak power?",1532520195,"Okay, I feel like I have a decent understanding between engine torque and power. An engine with more torque gives you the ability of more 'work bandwidth' so to speak, in that you can do more work at once, it will just take longer to do said work vs an engine with more power. Imagine a race between a 100m sprinter and then the world's strongest man carrying a 60kg boulder. I'm also aware that torque output can be manipulated through gearing and that torque figures are meaningless without knowing the rpm as well.

But for the sake of getting a car down a straight as fast as possible, what is more important, torque or power? So far, every video I've watched is pointing towards power. And obviously that must be the case, as watching F1 from the 3.0 V10 and 2.4 V8 days all of the cars are geared to keep the cars in the peak power range of engine rpm.

But when I try think about it, all I can think of is the fact generally speaking, a car's acceleration is equal to the tractive effort minus drag and rolling resistance divided by the mass. And this brings me back to thinking torque is the key since the tractive force at the contact patch is just torque divided by the wheel radius.

One of the main points people make, is that for maximum acceleration, you want to downshift in order to bring up the engine revs, this brings the engine up to it's peak power range thus increasing acceleration, but again, is the increase in acceleration from downshifting not from the fact you've multiplied the torque output from changing the gear ratio and thus a bigger tractive force in F = ma

I was just thinking about transformers because there was a power outage in the town, and I couldn't figure how one can make more voltage ex nihilo. But I was wrong because I was looking at Voltage as something passive that comes out of a battery, and influences Amps. But, then it hit me: When you have more windings of the coil on the right side of the core, then there are more points where the magnetism can touch the culoumbs, and push them. And the sum of those little pushes is a massive pushing force in the form of more Voltage.




Now, is the induced magnetic flux by the primary winding constant or does it fall with the number of winds on the second winding? Or are the limiting factors overheating or something? Maybe the second winding produces back emf or something, and that slows down the induced flux to a point where it stalls. I dunno. How do transformers make 400 kV from 10 kV ? that's 40x the Voltage.

76,Best Means of Production For a Personal Project,1532492067,"Hi guys!

I originally made this project as my senior design project about a year ago, but now that I've graduated I've decided to try and create a Rev. B of my project with some improvements.

A quick explanation of my project:

A Jack and Coke dispenser!

Very simple project in total, with some quirky problems to solve.

In my newest version of the project, I'd like to create a reservoir of sorts to hold the drinks of my choosing. In the latest revision, I've decided on using a 4inch PVC pipe as my reservoir, with a coupler to step down from 4 inches to .5 inches, where I'll connect a .5 inch vinyl tube that will later connect to my microcontroller-connected valve. 

This question lies with that coupler. 

I designed and 3D printed a compact coupler to do my step down in about 2.5 inches, and I'm trying to decide on the most elegant solution of actually making this coupler.

I'd like to keep it a bit... cost effective. 

I looked into 3D printing it and the materials that would be good for this. ABS is out, as it isn't food safe. 

Untreated PLA is out because it's porous. However, the internet tells me that PLA sealed with polyurethane is both food safe and non-porous. so it's a maybe.

Using dental-grade SLA would be a good option in terms of it being non-porous and food safe, but it isn't very cost effective, as it'll probably cost me at least $70 to have ONE printed, and I'd need 4 for a single unit. 

One of the mechanical engineers at work suggested I scrap the separate coupler and PVC reservoir altogether, and design the reservoir and coupler together in one part, which would be ideal but will make it harder to 3D print, as its now a significantly larger part. 

He also suggested I either buy a solid block of HDPE or Acrylic large enough and use a lathe, also a good maybe.

Another option I'd like to explore is making a single 3D print of this, and then trying to create a mold with it to do a garage-style injection molding type setup to make the part. Does anyone have any feedback on the plausability or cost-effectiveness of this idea? and how I should go about that?

Any other suggestions would be very well received!

89,Trying to optimize a number of parameters - what are my options?,1532448917,"As a part of my job I design open channels, typically with a trapezoidal cross sections. The channels need to have a prescribed cross sectional area, top width, mean depth and volumetric flow rate, but these parameters are impossible to reconcile with one another completely. Because the channel is trapezoidal, you can fully define its shape with any two of top width, mean depth, max depth and area.

I've considered a few approaches to optimize the channel design. One is minimizing a simple objective function that is the dot product of the % deviation from the prescribed value and a vector of weights. There are obviously a few ways to actually optimize this, and I've tried genetic algorithms and simulated annealing just to try them out but the search space is small enough that enumerating all of the possible combinations works fine. The issue is that the objective function I described can give very different answers depending on the weights given, and it is difficult to really justify any weight combination.

Another method I've considered is finding the pareto frontier (using the % deviation for each parameter as its own objective function) and allowing the end user to select one of the pareto efficient solutions. This would be good since it allows the end user to make a call about the final design since the other efficient solutions are not obscured. My concern (and I haven't implemented this yet so I'm not sure) is (depending on the granularity of the search) that there might be a large number of pareto efficient solutions. It would be good to keep the number of solutions to around 5 or so, but I'm not aware of any algorithms that could reduce the size of the pareto frontier in a meaningful way.

My proposal is to increase the energy efficiency of a pen manufacturing plant by installing solar panels, as well as installing better air treatment and a new HVAC system for increased air quality for employees in direct contact with the chemical fumes due to plastics manufacturing.  

I have been unable to find estimated prices for solar panels and an HVAC system. Does anyone know the prices and have a reliable source for the pricing? In addition, I can't seem to find the statistics for a manufacturing plants average yearly energy consumption. 

My bachelor's studies are in the field of Building engineering if that helps. 

Any advice or information and sources will be greatly appreciated.

10,"Worried about career path and my sanity, help?",1532395041,"Within the last 6 months I started a new role that was in a different industry. I am finding the transition difficult. This is my second job out of school, my first was not very technical though I still was designing some parts in SolidWorks, running some basic static studies to estimate weight requirements, and doing some electrical load calculations for sizing bus bar, contactors, etc. This new industry uses very little of that direct knowledge (which is to be expected) but I am learning that I might not be cut out to be a ""real"" engineer and I'm having a hard time coming to terms with that. A part of the training program is completing various tasks and I've been juggling 3 projects recently so some of the training has fallen by the wayside due to business needs, so I don't feel I'm hardly qualified to be doing what I'm doing.

I've never really struggled like this before, not even in school (I was just an indecisive lazy git and when I look back on that time it wouldn't have been as hard as I made it out to be/made it for myself). I'm booking a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist/something appointment for next week because about three times a week for the last two months I break down with self-doubt and the realization that I'm not where a person nearly 5 years out of school should be. Everyone else on my team is much more competent (granted most of them have been here for at least a year) but I think it's plain to see that I am the weak link. I didn't do great in school and I don't have a masters, which is the opposite for about half the rest of the team. We recently did performance evaluations and I was pretty rough on myself for mine but I wouldn't say it's inaccurate. I have not seen my evaluation from my superiors, though.  


Therefore my questions to you fine folk are these:

* Am I cut out for this career path? I appreciate the education I received but at the same time I feel that it was probably wasted on me. I made the switch into engineering from business and while I struggled overall the deeper into the major classes I got the easier it got, but by then my continual major-switching had caught up with me GPA-wise.
* Most of my engineering student friends didn't actually end up to be engineers but honestly I don't know what else to do. What are some jobs for the engineering graduates who realize they probably should leave the engineering to the better-equipped/more competent folk?
* To those of you who felt you couldn't quite hack it at being an engineer and so you moved on, was the change worth it? How was the transition? I'm afraid of seeming like just another job hopper when really I'd be finding a position that fits with me and my skills.

I can provide more info if needed, and sorry if this reads like the ramblings of a mad man, I'm not in a good place right now. 

tl;dr - I don't think I'm even an average engineer with 4-5 years experience, self-esteem and self-confidence is gone entirely, don't know if I can hack it and might want to throw in the towel, help?

[Here's questions 7 and 8](https://imgur.com/DKGuwVW) And here are the [answers to 7 and 8.](https://imgur.com/Nz3TId8)

My problem with 7 is that I don't see how B is an unambiguously correct answer. Is not manufacturing time also a primary constraint because if you can't produce it in time then they can't use it at all? A case could also be made for D since if the drill destroys or otherwise corrupts the ice and leads to unusable cores then it's useless as well.

With #8, I understand the importance of not relying solely on theory and having empirical data to ground your practice. But would anyone actually build a physical model of a retaining wall and test it out? I can't see an engineer not doing A, B, or D, but I can definitely see someone trusting numerical models due to the overall simplicity of the structure and moving on with the prototype.

The issue I have here is that we don't actually know what the purpose of this chemical compound is. When I first heard that they were trying to make a material ""comparable to the substance marine mussels use to attach themselves to rocks"", my first thought was to make a wetadhesive that as closely mimics the properties of the adhesive used by mussels.

I had already made it through several rounds of interviews for each of the different position and everything had been going great and I could answer all the technical questions and all their miscellaneous questions. They all said they liked my attitude and my knowledge/skills but I just didn't have enough experience despite all the jobs only asking for 0-2 years of experience.

I'm just not sure what to do next. I feel sick and I know that my odds of hearing back from any of the applications I had sent out while interviewing with these 3 within the next month are probably pretty low, and even if I do hear back from the applications it would be another month until I knew if I got the job or not.

Is there any way I can fast track this process?

Started working for a tier 1 OEM automotive company as a process engineer and now have two years under my belt. My role has progressed along the way, having dealt with several processes I have been heavily involved with project planning and new business growth. It is this very aspect that has got me thinking about taking the plunge into a more business/commercial facing role and I feel I am more suited towards projects, customer facing and would like to see myself in some form of management role in the future. 

I have an opportunity for an interview as a business development manager which would involve maintaining key accounts, expanding and seeking new business, ensuring customers know exactly how the product can benefit them. However, I am unsure about this switch as I wouldn’t want to ruin my chances in the future on a one time wonder going into the wrong career path. 

I have goals of achieving an MBA, becoming a chartered engineer (UK) and working my way up the career chain. Does anyone have any experience with this change from engineer to business or staying in engineering and going into a more management faces role?

I'm planning on getting a PE license eventually in my career and want to hold the title of Engineer, but from the things I've read online graduates of MET undergrad programs aren't considered engineers and are regarded as technologist. 2/3 of states in the US allow me to apply for a PE license after years of sufficient work experience, but many still don't.  I've been researching this and found in most industries the difference of job placement between a BSMET and BSME will be minimal to none at all at entry-level positions and I would get an engineering position, but i won't be able to raise up in the ranks so to speak. I planned on getting a masters in pure Mechanical Engineering after i graduate and have found a job, in hopes that it'll cause jobs to look away from my bachelors (I know i'll have to complete some prerequisite in order to be accepted into these graduate programs).

38,Need Help with a Locking Mechanism for Shafts [X-Posted],1532364169,"Hi:

I am working on a project and am at my wit's end. Thought I would reach out to more gifted engineers than myself.

I am working on a rotary base used in Film and TV. I have the base ready and it's prototyped. Works great except for one thing: Locking it in place. [Here is the Solidworks Model](https://imgur.com/a/sg0WPRN)

The plate on top bolts on the shaft and rotates with the shaft. The top plate is where the equipment is mounted with screws. The equipment can weigh upto 200lbs. I have sized the bearing that I need and it is able to take the load when my company made the prototype.

The issue that I am facing is this: The green colored clamps are supposed to be the locking mechanism. But they don't lock the shaft from rotating. The shaft is made from steel and the clamps are made from Aluminum. What has started to happen is that the steel eats into aluminum, thereby losing the braking force. 

Here are the alternate mechanisms that I am thinking about, but cannot think of a practical way of implementing them:

* Centrifugal Clutch Brake. I can modify the top plate to be like a cup, bu then I cannot figure out an actuating mechanism or engage-disengage mechanism.

* Scroll Mechanism used in 3 jaw chuck. I tried to implement the scroll mechanism that would move the blocks into the slots on the shaft. But I was told by a senior engineer that it is not a good idea as the scrolls aren't really accurate. If the blocks don't go in precisely they may end up damaging the shaft.

* A hybrid of centrifugal clutch and the scroll. the Centrifugal clutch can act like a brake and the scroll can act like the engage-disengage mechanism. But what happens is that the base needs to be able to be locked up at any single given point. In this case, even if my model comes up perfect, I cannot achieve the lock-in-any-position requirement.

We don't use any electricals or hydraulics, so any options that require those aren't much useful.

49,RPM reduction with a series of flywheels,1532342042,"I have little knowledge on the mechanics of motion.  Perhaps, even what i have grasped looking into this matter is completely wrong.  

I was using a drill press recently and watching it how it work and it has put me on a mission to answer find out more about the movement of wheels.  Some questions I can not find the answer to partly because I lack the terminology to research more deeply.  I understand that a large pulley attached to a small pulley increases speed and a small pulley attached to a large pulley decreases its speed.  

How would a person using a flywheel (not a pulley) decrease the RPM of a motor from 1000 RPM to 100 RPM.  The way I imagine it is that there is a wheel attached to the shaft of a motor.  Then a rod is attached from that wheel to another wheel.  The second wheel is attached to smaller wheel on the same axis.  Another rod is attached to the smaller wheel and that rod runs to a larger wheel further reducing speed and the process can be continued (Used my limited drawing to illustrate the idea).  Am i correct that the RPM will continue to reduce in speed.  If I am right what kind of math is involved in figuring out the size of the wheels needed to reduce the RPM to a certain value.  I know I could just attach one wheel to another much larger wheel, but the ratio would make the wheel to large.

58,Career suggestion for less gifted engineer,1532330356,"hello all. I am an engineer and I have low IQ. As far as I can remember, supervised IQ testing that we had in elementary school, showed the IQ score somewhere in 8X range.  The IQ e-test I did as adult showed something in the middle of 9X range, but I don't trust these e-tests. Like this isn't enough, probably I also have a nice mixture of AD(H)D and depression. A winning combo.

While I somehow managed to pass my masters (by learning only fundamental stuff few days before testing and discarding everything else), my grades were utter crap. Math was the hardest subject to pass, along with low level digital logic, which was very suicidal subject.

I have already quit or been fired at two jobs. One job required from me to read scientific papers packed with all those formulas, and then do some analytic around it. I was lost. I was slow. I didn't get the papers no matter how many times I read them. It was like trying to read newspapers written by aliens.I did nothing. Cowokers were telling behind my back that I'm dumb, but that's nothing new as I occasional tend to hear that trough my whole life (e.g. dumbo, moron, smart-stupid dude, half stupid guy, aspie,...)

Currently I'm java programmer. What a nightmare. It's somewhat easier than electrical engineering, but hell, it gets tough regardless. I just get lost in all of that code, even if I wrote it by myself. It's like "" in which file is that variable?Oh it's here...oh noeh, it isn't...wait, I'll take a look in other file...it's not there either...ah, finally, it's here...but wait, this is wrong variable...what I am even looking for? \*facepalm\*""... I'm just scrolling pages and hoping that something will fall out of screen. Basically, everything that requires more than a modification of string, is an effort for me. Luckily, there is stackoverflow with a packed set of copy-paste ready solutions, but unfortunately it doesn't always work. It took me half of year to add few simple views to application, update the database and change few colors. Horrendous. Sometimes when I'm programming I lough out of misery. But half of the time I'm not even programming, but instead i'm fidgeting something or watching videos about baking cakes, because I perceive programming (and other engineering development jobs) boring and hard to do as fucking hell. I say ""perceive"" because it might not be boring, but because i suck at it, I cope with it by seeing it as boring.

So, it clear that any kind of development is apparently not for me. Even if I can do it, I'm too slow with this shit (probably that's where IQ kicks in, because to my knowing, it measures how much you can do per time, not how much you can do)

The plan was to have a linkage connecting the shaft of the throttle to the ball screw nut and moving that would create some resistance, but I don't have one handy to figure out if it would work at all.

Practical way to apply force to the sides of the vehicle?",1532295916,"Would this be a way of applying two balanced forces to the two sides of the car? or would it be too reliant on wheel speed to ever really do any good (differences in corners might lead to issues, too)? I am thinking for some reason it would kind of preload it side to side and maybe it would be more likely to skid sideways than without it. Would it be something to have the fan made of [slats like a windmill](https://media.lightingnewyork.com/vendors/qrm/gallery/95210-86.jpg), but have it so that the angle of those slats can be changed, to change the amount of force it applies? Dual purpose I suppose in forcing air through onto the brakes for cooling. I don't have an application for it or anything - just idle pondering, and it may be an entirely silly idea.


I know not that long ago, [the F1 racing league had a system for cooling the brakes that used an impeller within the hub to channel air through holes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringPorn/comments/5ejcc1/how_the_brake_cooling_system_works_in_a_f1_car/) drilled radially into the edge of the disk, but that was specifically for brake cooling. Is that really answering my own question? Like is a fan that size, operating at that RPM even a real amount of force to consider for something the mass of a car?


Unrelated, but kinda related to that style of fan, while I was writing this I was trying to think of what it's called when you've got those flat slat blades but you can adjust the pitch of the blades and it functions like a door in front of a big fan, like a valve for air. They open by turning perpendicular to the plane the fan is in, and close by turning so they lie in that plane. I might be imagining it, since I can't find a picture of what I'm talking about, but for some reason I feel like I've seen something built like that in a barn or a warehouse or something for ventilation.

Here is a picture of the [setup](http://imgur.com/gallery/vGmx8Xc).

My goal is to have the smoke fall down into the collecting container and be trapped inside. With the smoke being cool, it drops down and collects at the bottom of the collecting container, and it is fairly dense smoke,  but quickly it begins to expand and exit the container. 

The collecting container must have (as far as I can tell) an opening in order to let out the atmospheric air that the entering smoke displaces. But again, as the smoke starts expanding, it begins to leave the container. 

My thought on how to fix this is if I can somehow have a layer or pocket of atmospheric air forming at the top of the collecting container, that would act as a seal to trap the smoke that falls underneath. By having the air gaps between the smoke pipe and the neck walls of the collecting container, I was hoping a column of air would form, trapping the smoke underneath.

I'm an incoming high school senior about to apply to colleges for engineering, but I am still undecided on what type. I did do an internship this summer but that involved civil engineering which while fairly interesting is not what I want to do in the future - however I would like to do something similar, which is why I am considering mechanical. My parents on the other hand want me to do electrical because it has higher-paying job opportunities. What I like about engineering is the design process (I took a class in which we designed a bridge and a robot and such so the designing and coding part really appealed to me - building them was also really fun) so would that be more mechanical or electrical? I assumed it's more mechanical but does electrical also involve that to a large degree? I would choose MechE except I am also very interested in math - I lead math club, go to competitions, went to a summer program for it, etc - and that's part of EE...

I could just choose one of the two majors and switch in college but I'm applying to UC Berkeley and that has an EECS program which my parents want me to apply to, even though it's hard to get in. And I'm worried that if I apply to EECS and get rejected I might miss out on mechanical, and if I don't apply but later want to do it that's also a problem.

The steel C-channel frame rails are 1-11/16” x 3”, in 3/32”.  The rails are not structural C-channel with webs; rather they are essentially sheet metal as they have uniform 3/32” thickness everywhere.




I’d like to reduce weight while maintaining existing strength by building another trailer in aluminum. I do NOT need it to be more stiff than the steel one.



Please help me decide what dimensions and profile to use, and walk me through the calculations.




I presume box section is the way to go. I don’t mind increasing the vertical dimension to get the rigidity up.  How do we calculate how rigid the steel is so that we can look at aluminum tubing to find a sufficient size? 





And how do we (you and I, dear reader) decide how to balance wall thickness and vertical height?



For example, how do we decide between a (theoretical example here) 2”x4” box tube in .125”, or a 2”x6” box tube in .090”? Again, that’s just a made up example to illustrate my question.

I am working on a test to determine the water contamination of a liquid polymer.

However, when I add the polymers in question I am getting a calculated dielectric constant of around 88k.  As near as I can tell this seems to be rather abnormal except for specialized substances.  I am just wondering if there is some design flaw that I am not considering which would account for a wild value like that.  Before anyone asks, no information is available on the liquid polymer so I was hoping to prove the accuracy of the device before I determined the polymer's constant.

I have not done any other measurements of the components or otherwise.

I know the diesel won't be the best on some of the seals in the pump possibly, but I'm not to worried about that and will wash it out with soapy water when done.

61,Could you explain to me a capacitor-start single phase induction motor?,1532032861,"Hey guys!




I was just telling my friend how induction motors are cool and how they have 3 phases, and he was like: ""dude, all the cool kids use the one phase capacitor starting induction motor"". So, yea, here I am.




It is my understanding that a capacitor works like a battery, and it can discharge some higher/lower amount of Voltage at a certain rate, and for a certain time depending on how big it is. But in the videos I watched, it had to be manually switched to once it was full. It would maybe make sense if it was self filling and self-discharging, but like this? 



Here is the [schematics](https://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/02488.png)



Apparently, the switch isn't your everyday switch that initiates the circuit, because the left side runs by itself. I think it is the infamous ""centrifugal switch"", which I have no idea how it works. I guess it is ON whne you start the motor, and  then it serves as a what? Kind of delay mechanism so the second winding starts ""off-beat"" to the main winding frequency? Wouldn't it make sense to put the capacitor before the winding in the schematic? Would be more chronological. So how does the capacitor work? Is it really self-discharging? No need for a switch?




And also, there are a lot of windings all around the stator. Is the same loop just a few notches apart like in the three phased one, or are all the winding loops vertical (top at top, and bottom at bottom, instead of both being kinda to the side, on a wall) ?




And most importantly, the capacitor loop that gets shut down once the armature reaches good speed, is there only one winding of the wire, or are there lots of them? Wouldn't lots of them be kind of wasteful, because ouy use them only for starting? Then agian, just one looks a tad too low.




Please explain this to me like I am 3!

Why exactly does pH read lower when the probe touches the container walls compared to being fully suspended in the sample solution?  I can see that touching the container walls is causing a change in voltage, but why/how?

83,Gave an EE $700 for a simple ask - he gave me a PCB that had multiple problems. Now I turn to reddit,1531978497,"Okay reddit,

I'm trying to create a product that includes a timer and an electromagnet. Basically, all I want is a PCB so that I can press a button, and the electromagnet turns on for an hour before turning itself off. After it is off, it does not turn on until the next button press, in which it should run for the same hour duration again (and so on). The electromagnet is being run off of 2 AA batteries.

Not sure if this is relevant, but the current being sent to the electromagnet is ~30 milliamps.

It is important that there is no way the electromagnet will stay on longer than the one hour period. Eg if there is a soldering crack or something of that sort, the electromagnet needs to not have power (rather than stay magnetized until the batteries finally drain).

The EE first pointed us to TI5110 nanotimer (http://www.ti.com/product/TPL5110/), along with a p-channel transistor. However, the PCB he sent us at first was completely wrong and didn't put the timer into 'one-shot' mode. Next, he sent us a PCB that has a whole number of other issues which kept the electromagnet magnetized beyond the required duration.

When we looked at it ourselves, we thought we should be using a TI5111 timer (http://www.ti.com/product/tpl5111/) rather than a 5110, as the default to pin 5 is low rather than high - so I would think that eliminates malfunctions in the timer or soldering to have the electromagnet magnetized.

The button we are using is https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/te-connectivity-alcoswitch-switches/FSM6JSMA/450-1133-ND/525822 - can switch to another small button if needed though.

Basically my ask is if someone can just tell us if the 5111 timer sounds like it suits our needs, or if he pointed us in the complete wrong direction.

We need very low power consumption so that the product has a long shelf life - eg. the timers we are looking at are 35na. The batteries will never be replaced. I would think there is an ultra cheap solution for what we are trying to do, since it's just a very straightforward concept.

87,Quick Question to make sure I'm on the right page.,1531960669,"I have a quick question about air ducts (this is probably more tailored to an HVAC type situation).

Basically there is a box that needs a certain m3/s of air to be discharged every few minutes. There is a unit pulling the air out at a constant rate. This unit is connected to the box by one larger duct which branches into two smaller ones at the front and backend.

Here is a very basic schematic of the system. [https://imgur.com/a/vWoJSzt](https://imgur.com/a/vWoJSzt)

So I'll summarize the math.

Bigger duct diameter: 0.5 m

Smaller branched duct diameter: 0.25 m

Box: 100 m \* 10 m \* 5 m = 5000 m3

Discharge time: 5 min

Fan speed: 50 m / s

Math:

Discharge rate: 5000 m3 / 5 min = 1000 m3 / min

Exit (bigger duct) max pull rate: 50 m / s \* \[pi \* (0.5 m)\^2 / 4\] \* \[60 s / min\] = 589 m3 / min

Entrance (smaller duct) max pull rate: 50 m / s \* \[pi \* (0.25 m)\^2 / 4\] \* \[60 s / min\] = 147 m3 / min

But since there are two smaller ducts the pull rate from the entrance would actually be 2x and be 294 m3 / min correct? 

And if this is the case, the current setup can't handle the 1000 m3 / min rate, so a larger fan of \~170 m/s would be needed  or larger entrance and exit duct diameters would be needed correct?

93,Scared about Top Secret clearance process,1531950385,"So, last summer after graduating from college I decided to lie to my parents and not tell them that I quit my part time job on the first day because I hated every minute of being there. Instead of going to work I would go to the library or my old college and use the computers to keep up with stuff in my field and apply for jobs. I didn't think it would matter because who was it going to hurt, I would have a job soon anyways right? Wrong. I struck out for like 10 months and when I finally got someone who wants to hire me it comes with the caveat of needing top secret clearance. I didn't lie about anything on my forms nor to the person doing the investigation, nor on the polygraph, however, I am freaking out that because I never told my parents that I don't actually work at that part time job I will be denied clearance. I know I should probably just tell them, but I cant imagine how badly they would react considering how they react to even the smallest of things. I don't have a great relationship with them.

Anyway, I don't want to tell them. They think I currently work two part time jobs when i only have one. The people doing my investigation know i only work for one and even if my parents tell them I work for two, they'll find out I didn't lie to them because when they call the job I quit from they'll obviously say I don't work there.

I'm such a paranoid person and haven't been able to eat for two days. Will this white lie that snowballed for a year be enough to deny my clearance? I don't drink, do any drugs, my driving is clean, my friends are clean, and I have no debt to anyone.

Currently I have two casted parts (a foot and a column which sits on top of the foot) that are part of an ultrasonic welding unit we are assembling.

The column is about 3 feet tall and sits vertically on top of the foot. There are two 7.6mm through holes in the foot which line up with 7.6mm blind holes in the column. Once we have the foot and the column aligned, we are then supposed to ream out the holes with an 8mm reamer and knock a pin in to secure the fit.

We are currently doing this by laying the machine on its back, aligning foot and column, and then reaming with a corded drill. We have also tried leaving the machine in the upright position and reaming from underneath, but then you get debris all over you.

In both cases the pin is always loose. In the few units we have tested, we have had to use loctite to secure the pin.

I would suspect most of our problem stems from vibrations and misalignment due to reaming by hand, but given our setup there is no other option. What else can I do to get better results?

34,How much of a correlation is there between engine displacement and highway mileage.,1531848539,"Not sure if this is the right forum but oh well.  Here goes it.

So here's the thing, I like buying broken stuff and fixing it up, using frugality as a challenge.  Making my own parts, retrofitting, buying used, selling excess etc.   I recently got into motorcycles, and everyone has been saying that you should stick with a 250cc learner bike (about 40 horsepower).  But I found an amazing deal on a 900cc sportbike, easy fixes and a real beauty.  Its way too fast though (145hp).  So I want to \*\*restrict the throttle\*\* using some homemade bump stop on the throttle cable to the carb, so that its limited to halfway open lets say.  But I keep hearing about getting worse fuel economy and was wondering what would cause that.

So as I understand it:

\-A certain amount of air and fuel is required to generate a certain amount of energy.

\-If two bikes have the same profile, and coefficient of drag, they will require the same energy to travel at a set speed

\-A 250cc bike operating at 10 000 RPM moves about 44 CFM, which is about 63hp according to an online calculator

\-A 900cc bike operating at 3250 RPM moves about 44CFM, which is about 63hp according to an online calculator

\-If we assume both have the same frontal area and coefficient of drag, then the two bikes should be able to go at the same speed at these two different RPMs, moving the same amount of air and burning the same amount of fuel.

Here's the thing though, a lot of people get like 44mpg on a 900cc race bike while trying to drive as efficiently as possible.  Meanwhile people get like 85mpg commuting on a 250cc bike.  That is a huge discrepancy, where does it come from?  Why can't my quarter throttle 900 come close to the mileage of a 250?  A few possibilities I have come up with are.

\-Bigger oil pump, more oil moved, saps more power.

\-Bigger water pump, more water moved, saps power.

\-Bigger piston bore, more ring circumference, more piston ring friction

\-Bigger radiator, more wind resistance

\-Jury is out on front profile, one would suspect that a race bike would be larger but have more efficient aerodynamics than a small cruiser, its made for racing after all.  Can't comment on this.

Could this stuff really cut fuel mileage in \*\*HALF\*\* though?  What gives?  The other weird thing is that a big ass engine turning 3250rpm is also turning the water pump and oil pump slower so the jury is out on exactly how significant those variables are.  Piston ring friction is small too.  I saw a Dyno demonstration where reducing the piston ring thickness on a Chevy 350 only increased HP by 8.  That's a small amount on a much much much bigger engine.  As far as pushing air through a slightly larger radiator, the effect can't be that crazy.  I see cars pushing 50mpg these days with a way bigger profile and radiator, so the drag in normal driving mustn't be the end of the world.

I suspect it has something to do with volumetric efficiency, but even then that doesn't make sense.  The effect of reduced VE on compression ratio, and in turn on efficiency is confusing because it reduces the energy lost during the compression stroke as well as reducing energy harnessed during the explosive stroke.  Some of the most efficient economical cars around only get like 9:1.  Most sport bikes are like 12:1 and it doesn't seem to do them any good for efficiency.

35,"How can I decide how much ""engineering"" should I apply to build something?",1531846159,"Myself as context: I'm a mechatronics engineer, but because the ugly state of the ""mechatronics"" industry in Mexico I'm not working as a mechatronics engineer anymore. I hated with all my soul becoming a catalogs engineer or integration engineer, only selecting pieces of machines and integrating it like a lego without doing any real mental job. Becoming a ""trust employee"" (Trust employee is the one that doesn't receive any pay for overtime, and needs to finish the job by any means necessary) was the worst for my health, I got more and more depressed and stressed all the time and without a good pay to justify my ""work"" I left the industry after ~2 years of working in it.


I'm now working as a software engineer, for some reason my pay tripled without any ""experience"" in the field, my workload increased but I work less hours now. And I feel like I'm learning more and more about software, methodologies, teamwork and how to solve problems, I also got a lot more of free time now.


Now that I have more free time, I want to go back to the 'real' mechatronics. I'm not gonna lie, I got motivated watching some videos in youtube of people that I feel that they are applying all the aspects of mechatronics in their projects. 


**My** **problem:** I don't know how to approach to the mechanical part of engineering, as my first project of my ""new era of """"""enlightenment""""""(/s)"" I want to build a **lathe**. So, **I** **asked** **two** **friends** engineers for advice and help. **The** **first** said, 'Ok, let's do it the lathe' but he was not interested in the engineering part of building things, no numbers, no material selection, really basic drawings and if it doesn't look dangerous is ok. I don't want to be so careless and learn how my lathe is working and how can I improve it. **The** **second** didn't want to work with me, because he wanted all the designs specified with GD&amp;T upfront, all the cost already defined, that we comply every norm required to build one and that I needed a lot of experience to build one. And also required the purpose of the lathe, I told him to build a better lathe, he told me to buy a lathe instead of building one... I want to own a lathe, and by own I mean know how exactly works and be able to modify it or create a new one.


I do believe they are both wrong, there should be a mid point between all of that. Some bottom-up approach or ""incremental builds"" equivalent to software to build an unique machine for myself, maybe I'm wrong and I should design everything upfront in exchange of a lot of time. I don't know, what are the methodologies should I follow?, what I need to learn to build a working machine?, when does a norm become more costly apply it instead of not using it? etc...

There's another company that does some really cool stuff with FPGAs, who I've met with and been in communication with for a little while now, discussing doing a final year thesis that straddles uni and industry, focusing my final year on an FPGA based project that emphasises low latency network communications. But they couldn't pay me presently, I'd have to graduate first. It could also get a bit more tricky with NDAs, and how a final year project involving NDAs could be managed.

My current employer did recently acquire a company that has an FPGA in a product, which they want me to get familiar with. There's also the possibility of doing a similar thesis year project with them using such technology, in a machine vision context. They do have a broader scope though.

Imagine you are on a desert island with a DC motor, a ruler, a 1.5 V AA battery, and one of those yellow measuring devices. How are you gonna calculate the amount of flux the stator is exhibiting onto the armature? Magnetic force is important because it spins the armature, especially in an induction motor ( which twirls the magnetic field and that spins the free floating metal armature)...



Then, you can maybe decide how many more turns of wire you need to get x torque.

76,Why do some body over frame vehicles have square frame rails?,1531763353,"The frame on my Jeep has a square profile. The vehicle is short and the frame rails aren't very tall, this leads me to believe that a square cross-section was selected as optimal because of its' torsional rigidity. Not much deformation on or off road, and they can manufacture a frame that can fit in a small vehicle, cost-effectively.

However, there is nowhere for water to drain. When water (and road salts) gets inside of the frame, they just sit and corrode the metal. The frames are known for rotting from the inside out, without much of a warning. I've had to do a lot of welding on my frame, and I'm starting to think of it as sort of a design flaw.

With a channel (think of the shape of a staple if you aren't aware), whatever water comes into contact with the frame can just drip off or be blown away by wind. It doesn't get trapped and rot the frame away, it can blow off in the wind or just drip off. 

My question is- is there a better way, a best of both worlds? I'm an ME student so I have a good understanding of mechanics of materials, but I'd think that the auto maker could just use a channel shape instead. This way you could (again, correct me if I'm wrong) have a frame with the same strength that won't trap moisture and rot away over the years. The frame rails might be a little taller, but in my eyes it would be worth it if the frame lasts much longer.

Cost is always a factor, but channels have been used for a really long time by now. Not sure what the difference is in price, but I can't imagine it would be that different.

79,How do engineering college students learn so fast in so little time?,1531760384,"Hello guys,

I just finished my IT minor and am going to a Computer Science major. For my IT undergrad I studied about 5-6 hours each day, albeit most of the time I studied IT-related topics, not necessarily the thing required for a course. If I average my time, I studied 2-3 hours each day exclusively for my IT minor.

When my friend who went to a Computer Science minor came to my apartment to hang out, he told me that he learned probability in 4 days (10 hours each day) before an exam. To my amazement, he produced correct answers to some tasks which I struggled with (at the time, I was learning it and he decided to step in and help me). The probability exercises weren't so hard, but still it was an impressive feat, because probability ain't easy. I also have a friend who worked 5-6 hours a day each workday and still managed to pass his Computer Science major with really good grades.

My question is - *How do you study so efficiently?*

I am currently adopting to working at least 7 hours a day each workday, but I am really curious about your efficiency while studying. *How can you (engineers) be so efficient while studying?* I am more of a person who chips away at things day in day out, but if I'm investing at least 7 hours each day then after 6 months or a year I should be light years ahead of someone who studies 2-3 days before an exam.

Please help me understand this phenomenon.

P.S. There are a lot of programs about ""efficient learning"" out there. Most of them seem full of fluff. I read *How to be a Straight-A Student* by Cal Newport and *Make It Stick* and from those books I implemented organizing my days, reviewing periodically (hence the use of Anki) and testing myself (that is also done by answering the questions in Anki).

82,How to apply better color parameters on PVC production?,1531754914,"Hi Engineers,

I am working as a recent graduate plastic engineer for a PVC,PP , and PET plant on the SE coast and it has been an eye-opening experience. We have our fair share of issues in production, but it is often our job to think about solutions on how to fix it.

My current dilemma is correcting a major issue in our plant and I have no other ideas besides asking other more experienced Plastic and Chemical engineers on this subreddit. Apparently for a few years now, this plant has had a color issue with our PVC products being out-of-spec. Often our constraints using the L-a-b values on a Color Spectrometer is too wide so products tend to be on far ends of the +/- scale for either of these parameters so our customers and our own employees see color variations. And why do we have color variations in our products?

It is due to our equipment being on the older end (+20 years) and nearly everything is still done manually. As in, pigment is added manually in our feeders and expect equal dispersion in the mixers. It could be in our calendaring process where we operate at different thicknesses so our extruded sheets' color is stretched too far and the color shifts as well. 

I would like to apply LEAN practice to this, but I do not know where to start. I'm thinking of tightening up our color constraints but that would make our actual production to have more Recalls/Rejects since we cannot control it that tight. What are some suggestions on how/where to start since I know of the ""why"" this is like this, but now I need some assistance on where to correct/lead it into a better direction?

# What's an average day like for an engineer?

One of the most common questions asked by people looking into a career in engineering is, *""What do engineers actually do?*"" or, *""What's an average day like for an engineer?""* While these questions may appear simple, they're a gateway to a vast amount of information... much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful, and often fails to describe anything specific about engineering work.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers hosts this annual Work Experience Thread where engineers can talk about their daily job activities and career in general. This series has been successful in guiding students towards the best major for them, and helping engineers better understand what their counterparts in other disciplines do.

Today's thread is for engineers who want to share their stories, advice, and collective knowledge with our community. The responses here will be archived in the AskEngineers wiki and made available as a public resource.
