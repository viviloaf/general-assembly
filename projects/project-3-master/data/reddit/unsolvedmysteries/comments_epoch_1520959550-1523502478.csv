0,[Question] Is there any biomedical engineering projects a freshman student could work on?,1523500855,"I wasn't too sure where to post this, so I'd be happy to move this somewhere more fitting if this isn't correct.

I'm a freshman EE student with a concentration in biomedical, so far I've just taken digital design. I was hoping to work on a project somewhat related to engineering this summer (all my past ones were all software), but I can't think of many that would connect much to biomedical.

I was debating on taking some well-known biosensors or devices, and trying to recreate it and documenting what I learned.

On the non-biomedical side, my only other ideas were to make a mini-rover, or a clock with a rotating LED stem that you can change brightness from a keypad, with a little display that tells you the range.

Is there any recommendations for projects that could semi-relate to the biomedical field?",AskEngineers,episha,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8bmwn1/question_is_there_any_biomedical_engineering/

4,Is Power Engineering a Dead-end for Innovation?,1523495862,"I'm a junior electrical engineering students, during my last year I have to make a decision whether to specialize in power engineering or communication &amp; electronics engineering, specialization will be in the form of taking 5 courses in the chosen field. Most students choose to follow the power engineering path, mostly for the reason it is less math-extensive and it slightly tackles renewable energy topics. I did very poorly in every power course I took before this point (e.g. circuits II, electrical machines), mainly because it was just too abstract and boring, like literally, it's the same circuit but in different configurations. Not to mention there was zero motivation to investigate problems such as power factor correction. And worst of all, instructors at my school are not qualified properly to teach such courses at this level; for instance, I never learned what is the real meaning of reactive power, until I had to google that, and before that I used do abstract calculations. When I realized that I know nothing about power engineering, I decided to read on my own, and that's when I came to the conclusion that power engineering isn't interesting at all. 

The generators, motors, transformers and transmission lines used these days are the same used 50 years ago, what happened over the course of 50 years are little optimizations, and they are largely driven by the material and computer revolutions, not something original nor classic in power engineering. Perhaps that's how it will stay for a while. Don't get me wrong, these machines get the job done, they solve the problem they originally were designed to solve, but that's just about it. I think any new power engineers are actually ""maintenance"" engineers, they don't add any new value to the field. Any problem to arise in this field, probably its solution has already been found in the past. 


On the other hand, in communication &amp; electronics engineering, your imagination is the only limit. Basically it is the contrary to power engineering. That's how I see both fields, how accurate my vision is?

6,Vibration Damping for Indoor Cycling,1523494681,"I live in an apartment building and occasionally use a [fluid trainer](https://www.cycleops.com/product/fluid2) or [rollers](https://www.cycleops.com/product/rollers) to train for bike racing.

Recently my downstairs neighbor made some comments about the noise, which I believe is more a result of vibrations sent through the trainer into the building than the actual noise that I am able to hear in my apartment (which, according to advertising materials/product reviews is probably a little over 60 decibels).

The first thing I have done is purchase [these](https://www.amazon.com/Diversitech-MP4-V-Anti-Vibration-Pack/dp/B00BVEMLR4/ref=pd_bxgy_328_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B00BVEMLR4&amp;pd_rd_r=E86020JY0NDBY642WTB9&amp;pd_rd_w=LxqfN&amp;pd_rd_wg=AmWab&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=E86020JY0NDBY642WTB9).

I downloaded a Vibrometer app onto my phone and measured the floor vibration near the rollers earlier tonight. Without those pads I was getting vibrations of about 3 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (I know nothing about this, its just what the app uses), with the pads it was measuring between 1 and 2.

This seems to be pretty low intensity vibrations, but I think the machines are resonating (again not sure this is accurate) and causing a low rumbling I can hear in my apartment and may be much louder in my neighbors.

What can I do to further isolate these vibrations? My thought is to make some kind of ""sandwich"" of vibration isolation materials, but I am having a very difficult time understanding the specifics of how this should work.

For example some materials are rated for a certain weight, usually in pounds per square inch. I assume me (165), plus the bike(15), plus the trainer (15?) weighs  about 200 lbs. 

Is a material going to behave differently if I place in directly under the 8 feet (about 1.25"" diameter each, so I figure about 25 lbs/inch) than if I put it between two 2'x2' sheets of MDF and set the trainer on that (so I would have 200 lbs distrusted over 4 4""x4"" pads putting me at closer the 3 lbs per square inch).

1) Do you think I have correctly identified the source of the noise?
2) Do you think my ""sandwich"" idea will work? 
        If not what would be better/easier?
        If so, could you offer me some information (I am happy to do some reading if you can guide me to it) on what materials I would want to use and some specifics of how it would be constructed?

I work in a woodworking shop to I have access to good variety of saws and presses (if I want to do any gluing) as well as some metal working equipment (MIG Welder, small mill) to actually put this together.

And a solution that took 4 hours to build (or 3 clicks on Amazon) would be much preferable to something that took 40.

We're currently running the thing off a leaf blower, but they've taped half the intake shut because ""we want high pressure air but not a lot of air volume"" going into the burn chamber.

1. Mastery, i’ve become proficient at this and am still building my skills at project management and have yet to undertake all types of transport infrastructure projects
1. Contribution, as i’ve been here doing project management for a few years I have a comprehensive grasp of what we do and we are in the process of going through an revising our framework
1. Comfort, change is difficult and i’m in a comfortably position where my commute is minimal, i enjoy the city i am in, i work flexible hours and i’m close to the city, leaving could mean i forgo any or all of these things

I’m writing to get advice from those who are in a similar position or have moved through similar things in their careers or anything thoughts or feedback. 

Thanks

42,"Military, master's, or straight to industry for someone about to graduate with a BS in ME and desire to work in the space industry?",1523424093,"Hey everybody,
So I'm about to graduate with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering as the title suggests. While it's been a journey getting here, the next steps are also super important, and I would love some advice from others in the field.

Here are some things about me:

* I want to work in the space industry, in whatever way I can. It's always been a dream of mine to work on helping humanity get out to that final frontier.
* gpa 3.4+, not amazing, but I was working as a tutor a significant portion of the time and doing research, so my academic course work suffered somewhat
* Research is in using solidworks for modeling skeletal structures, and developing a course structure for fracture mechanics (a class I had taken, but the Professor wanted assistance in making the course better)

So for my next part of this journey, I'm a little lost on what to do. I'm fully aware of the difficulty of getting in to the space industry, as it's a hot commodity right now. I've applied to a ton of places, had a couple of interviews, but nothing offered (yet).

Here's the dilemma I'm running into. What would be best do you guys think:

* Keep applying around for internships and jobs, even if it means waiting 3-6 months for a job offer to come my way? I know it's incredibly difficult to get a job out there for someone who has freshly graduated, and I might end up in a field that isn't totally related, such as industrial, HVAC, or sales engineer, but if experience is the key to getting other jobs, that might have to do

* I could join the Navy and try and get into their NUPOC program, as a Nuclear Propulsion Officer. I'm aware that it's unlikely I'll actually being working on the reactors, but the experience may look good on my resume, and I also know it may be a foot in the door to some places if I have some time served.

I'll be posting to the Navy subreddit as well to get their feedback as well

* Apply around and take the FE exam, and if nothing comes up after that, apply for Master's school. If I were to go for my Master's I was thinking Propulsion Engineering (I think that is under the umbrella of Aerospace), straight Mechanical Engineering, or perhaps Material's or HVAC for space systems (I hear that's also going to be important for Mars missions)

Or is there another route I'm not thinking of?

Unfortunately, they come at the price of throttle response and driveability because of the long path trough the front mount intercooler.

I've been thinking about a DIY coldside intercooled intake manifold. [I mocked it up on a random 3D 4 cylinder model I found.](https://imgur.com/a/1KGye) 

I would use the intake manifold bracing points to support the assembly. I would also overdrive the supercharger (Eaton M62) to about 12 psi and use a wastegate to keep a steady 7-8 psi in the last ~2500 RPMs. The wastegate would be right after the supercharger and would return air after the throttle body, into the compressor intake. A vacuum check valve would run from after the intercooler to the throttle body for responsiveness and smooth idling.

How feasible is this? What issues could come up? What hoses and sensors would I need to plumb to and from the manifold?

What about manifold design? I'd use aluminium sheet and thick plates to mate to the head and supercharger. How can I improve flow, throttled volume and packaging? The supercharger would likely sit closer to the engine, under the intercooler for sturdier mounting. The intake pipe would run up behind the intercooler and breath air from the hood scoop.

The bowling ball is at rest on a shelf 2M agl. I want to be able to push the ball off the shelf and have the rope take initial shock force. I then want the rope to fail after a few seconds and drop the ball to the ground.

I've recently come into a position of choosing between working with Honeywell (full time) or UTC Aerospace (part time).

72,Looking to make a carburated gasoline burner.,1523376106,"So my steam trike currently uses a big 10kW gasoline camp stove for a burner. While this was quick, easy, and fairly lightweight, it has some disadvantages. First, the burner itself has no turndown, and doesn't do on-off well. Second, it severely limits the possible shapes and configurations of my steam generation coils.

So I'm thinking about making a carburated burner. I want to connect a lawnmower carb and a pc centrifugal blower fan. I'm looking for a burn rate of around a gallon an hour, which gives me ~20cfm, which the right centrifugal pc blower fan can easily do. I would really prefer putting the carb downstream of the fan. This would keep gasoline out of the fan. However, I don't know if I'll be able to do that since a normal carb needs a good vacuum, and there would probably be too much positive pressure downstream of the blower fan. 

If I had to, I could try putting the carb upstream of the fan. This would mean there's gasoline in the fan, which might be bad for the plastic. I would also have to add a wire mesh screen to keep the flame front from blowing back into the fan. This would solve the vacuum problem though.

While this really isn't preferrable, I could fabricate a venturi with a hose going into the middle and make a crude homemade carb. This would introduce a good bit of testing and tuning and experimenting that wouldn't have to be done with an off the shelf carb.

76,I just turned 25 and things haven’t worked out for me at all engineering career/life wise. Please help me figure out on what I should do now [Might be a Long Read]?,1523367439,"**Background:**

I just turned 25 years old last month. I am officially into my mid-20’s and that fact really scares me. I graduated from Chemical Engineering in January 2017 in Canada. Started school around September 2010. My overall GPA (around 2.65 – 2.70) is horrendous due to my early year struggles (depression/shitty family situations). Final year GPA was better though (around 3.20-3.30). I did manage to get an internship for ~1.5 years (from Sept 2014 – Jan 2016) at an oil and gas company. The reviews I got from them were excellent and they highly recommended me to HR to re-hire for a new grad position. However, I didn’t keep in contact with my co-workers and may have burned bridges with them. Also, the reason I got the internship was that my friend convinced me to apply dishonestly and I wanted to escape the city and my family, so I went with it. So, I ended up not even applying to the new grad position due to the regret I felt and fear/anxiety. 

**Post Graduation:**

After graduating, I lived very nonchalantly with no real desire or drive to get a job. I applied causally without putting in the effort and wasted my time watching sports all day and night. Months passed by and I had obviously no success in terms of callbacks/interviews. Around June 2017, it hit me hard that I’ve found no job yet and I was just wasting life. My friends found jobs and were getting ahead in life. Reality hit me at that point and I started applying with more purpose. I also picked up a sales representative job that my friend got me in too. Around November 2017, I finally started getting some interviews. One of them was from a huge oil company. Overall, I got around 4-5 interviews/pre-assessment test and all of them resulted in rejections. That destroyed me. I realized that I always struggled to focus on things for long. I don’t have the mental ability to keep applying to jobs on the daily. I have always struggled to focus, even during my school years. May have some mental disability, fuck what do I know. My will to keep on applying was diminishing, even working the sales rep job, I felt major depression. Just standing there attempting to sell these stupid diffusers while everybody I knew was making great career advancements. These thoughts were killing me at this point on how much precious time I had wasted. I could feel my mental health deuterating. I have also been living alone and I don’t socialize as often with people anymore. My people skills have also degraded. I stay in my room most of the time on my laptop. I have no social life anymore because I’m too embarrassed to see people see me make no progress in life. 

**Future Options:**

It's April 2018 now, it’s been 16 months since I’ve graduated, and I haven’t done anything but waste time. The only positive is that I started going to the gym and that really helps me out (mentally and physically). This year I must do something, that’s what I’ve told myself. There’s no way in fucking hell that I’m going to waste this year and my precious time that I have. I want to make the most of my remaining 20’s. 

**Option 1:** Keep applying for jobs and hope things work out. This hasn’t worked so far lol. However, I realized I haven’t been applying for government jobs. I only applied to corporate jobs. The city I live in is a government job hub and a lot of my peers ended up getting government jobs. So, I could try applying over there and see if anything materializes. 

**Option 2:** Try for a master’s degree in chemical engineering. My GPA isn’t too great so there’s a chance I might not even get admitted but if I do I’m actually very hesitant for this because I know it’s going to be hard for me in terms of coursework (advanced theories, etc) and plus there’s no guarantee I can get a job after this. I may fall victim to the “you’re overqualified for this job” excuse.

**Option 3:** Attempt a 2nd bachelor’s degree in computer science. Now, I may have to spend at least another 2-3 years to accomplish this (maybe more if I enroll for CO-OP). I have 4 of my friends whom I graduated from chemical engineering with me that went straight for this. They didn’t have the luxury of having past chemical engineering internship experience that I did so for them it was even more difficult to land interviews/jobs. They have finished their 2 years of computer science studies and all of them have internships this summer. The city I live in is a major hub for tech companies with tons of opportunities. My friend has been trying to recruit me to join him ever since and I keep turning him down. The thought of going back to school kills me (all the projects, assignments, etc) but it’s better than having no purpose in life and wasting time doing shit all. I’m very bi-polar on how I feel about this though. Sometimes I’ll be excited about going back to school, meeting people and doing things the right way this time around. But other times, it hurts me to think that I wasted 6 years of my life in studying/interning chemical engineering and all that money I invested for it and also plenty of my friends already found amazing jobs without too much hassle ( I know, everybody’s life is different and all but I’m human and can’t help but feel this shitty way). I don’t know, maybe, a degree in computer science is the way to go. I am now seriously considering going to it. My friend also says he will help me out with everything I need to know, and he’ll give me all the material I need from the courses he’s already taken. 

**Option 4:** Go to a different city where chemical engineering is favored where they are job opportunities and apply there. This is an option but with no guarantee of success at all. Also, it would suck to live somewhere where you know no one.
Financial situation: I am fortunate to live on very low expenses currently. I have lived all alone for most of the time in a house my parents bought. My parents work in another country, so I don’t live with them. I think this has really messed with me because of how alone I’ve lived in a big house. I paid off my university debt (~$45K) with the money I earned as an intern and my parents helped me pay it off as well. I’m essentially debt free. I have no job as of now (I quit the sales rep job because it made me feel really depressed during work). I have around $10K saved up in my savings account right now. My dad has offered to pay my tuition if I decide to do computer science or a masters. He just wants me to do something productive. He’s concerned about me not finding a job and wasting my life away sitting at home. So, in terms of finances, I think I’m pretty good which I’m grateful for.

**Ideal Scenario:** I get a full-time job starting this summer in oil and gas/ process engineering. This would require me getting interviews this month lol. This is what I want the most, but this world we live in is a bitch and I know I can’t have what I want. 

These are the options that I came up with so far. I don’t know if there’s anything else I could try to do. I also have to work on my mental state. I wake to feel anxious/depressed a lot of the times. I’m pretty negative too I realized. Also, social skill improvements is a must. Maybe I should travel somewhere?

Sorry if this post got long/out of topic, any advice on how I should proceed with all things considered? I just want to make the most of my life from now on. I don’t want to waste my 20’s anymore doing fuck-all. 

Thank you for reading! Cheers

77,Need to pump warm or cold waste motor oil. What should I do?,1523360943,"I have a waste oil burner (boiler) that heats my home. It does great and is very cost effective, but gathering oil is a royal PITA. 

I have settled on swapping 300 gallon IBC containers (empty for a full) with a service station place; they load a full one on my trailer with a forklift, I bring it back to my house, and drain it by gravity. It takes awhile if it's cold, but not too bad.

My problem is I need to be able to get oil from other places. I have some sources, but I would need to pump it. I've used a manual barrel pump to do it, and it is a special kind of hell, so now I want an actual pump.

My problem is that I need something that can:

* Pump cold waste motor oil if need be. Not waste vegetable oil, which is thinner, but actual high viscosity waste motor oil (this usually means gear pumps).
* Pump it remotely - some of these places do not have a 120v line available.
* Air type pumps (ones where air is pumpel into a barrel and forces oil out a hose) wouldn't work for me, as I often store in plastic IBCs, and a lot of the places that store oil do not have air-tight drums.

I've seen 12v ones like these:

https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F202261374294

It says it is 39 amps. So question: Can I hook this up to a car battery (while the car is running)? Will it handle it?

Option 2:

GPI 142100-01, L5116 Oil Pump High Viscosity Oil Pump, 4 GPM, 115/230-VAC, 0.75-Inch Ball Valve Nozzle, 0.75-Inch X 8-Foot Hose, 3-Foot Power Cord with Three-Prong Grounded Plug, Suction Pipe https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UFQLYG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_l4jZAbY7ZMHP2

This is an AC one; it would be more convenient at home, but if I was remote I'd need an inverter; what kind minimum would I need? Like 1000w/2000w peak? Higher? 

My budget is pretty extended as it is, so I'm really only looking to get one pump to handle all of this.

2. I draw very poorly.

Those pier would support a vertical post and maybe two 45degree post attached to it (see picture)

Those three “post” supported by the pier would then support 1 sistered (2x 2x8) beam each to the other posts/pier, 8 feet away. See picture, beams location are at the circled B.

My understanding of the PRV is that the tension or compression of the spring can be set to using the setting screw at the very top. when the inlet pressure is high enough, the force exerted on the valve will open and reach an equilibrium related to the springs constant. The energy that it takes to maintain the stretching of the spring eats away at the pressure energy - such that a steady and equal force and pressure is maintained.

The video shows that as flow rate decreases, inlet pressure increases. Why is this? This seems counter intuitive to me.

I am coaching a team of elementary and middle school students who are building a balsa tower that will be scored on maximum weight held.  All the work of the tower needs to be theirs but I can explain engineering principles to them.

I've been using Euler's column formula to help them understand the factors that can influence column strength.

I now want to teach this to them in a more correct manner but I'm having trouble understanding it myself.

26,Is there such a thing as passive supercavitation?,1523260822,"So I was recently on a super weapons binge and I remembered the rods from god program. Then I also read an article on the russians supercavitation torpedo. So I thought about somehow combining the 2 ideas. Now since the whole purpose of the Rods From God program is to just drop a metal rod from space, the faster it goes, the more destructive it gets while also being brutally simple in terms of how simple the weapon is in theory. 

So anyways, since supercavitation can make a torpedo go faster underwater, would it be possible to create a similar effect, within the atmosphere by using the natural airflow that the weapon experiences as it drops from space. You can drastically increase the speed of the weapon without (in theory), making the weapon any more complicated and not putting more moving parts on it. Would it be possible to put a series of veins throughout the weapon that feeds air to the front of the warhead?",AskEngineers,LonesomeObserver,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8awt07/is_there_such_a_thing_as_passive_supercavitation/
27,unemployed electrical engineering graduate considering grad school,1523258936,"I earned a BS in electrical engineering in June 2017 but haven't been able to land a single job or internship despite 200+ applications and interviews with over a dozen companies. I have no previous internship or engineering work experience and fear that I am unemployable in my current state.

Because of this, I'm afraid I may have to go back to school. I've been accepted into a master's program at a decent state school (with my declared emphasis being power engineering), but I feel woefully unprepared and I'm worried about still having poor employment prospects after graduating. I'm also considering earning a BS in computer science because of the field's seemingly rosier future and higher demand for graduates (see https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/stem-jobs-industry-careers.html). It's also possible that I'm not intelligent enough to earn a master's in EE.

28,How to transition out of application engineering,1523255064,"Right now, I work at a pump distributor as a sort of an application engineer and mechanic. I've been there for about 3 year. For the day-to-day, I basically field technical questions, recommend pumps per customer requirements, troubleshoot issues, and physically repair pumps. In between, I occasionally create repair manuals, test new products, and other miscellaneous projects. 

However, there is no possibility to move upward so how can I transition into a more technical position such as manufacturing or product engineering/design? Many of the entry level positions require several years of CAD, CNC, six sigma/lean, or other industry specific experience. I've taken some Solidworks classes and practiced the basics by modeling common objects, but I don't think I can put that on a resume as experience can I? 

Should I spend my available time filling out applications and hope to get my foot in door in an industry first? Or focus on learning more software skills first? I'm not sure if I should really focus on one particular software skill since many positions requires different experiences.

On the CAD side, I know the basics of Solidworks, but should I also try to learn Catia, Pro/E, Inventor, AutoCAD, and others? On programming, I've used some VBA at work to automate tasks, but should I also try to learn Python, Matlab, and C++? Should I also try to learn FEA, CAM, six sigma, and PLC programming? I'm sure some of this could be useful to learn for a future job, but I feel like it could be a waste of time since I won't have actual experience with it and can't really put it on a resume.

31,High temperature resistant (plastics?),1523248033,"Hi Reddit, 

So I'm working on a startup, and am having a bit of an issue figuring out the materials to use for my product. I'll list off a few requirements of the product, and hopefully you guys will be able to help me out. The issue here is finding a material that is cost effective, and also heat resistant.

- The part I need is relatively small, about 3 inches across, .5 inch depth, 1 inch width. 
- The cost of the material needs to be as cheap as possible, we are trying to compete in a low-margin high volume business. Eg each part is hopefully &lt;$1 after molding costs. 
- Needs to be heat resistant - potential to be exposed to a couple hundred degrees of heat, needs to not melt. 
- Non-magnetic

I know this is very high level - I know a decent amount of plastics are safe up to 180 degree F, but I'm struggling to find much more about high temperature plastics, other than the fact that they exist (but with no costing information or anything of the sort). Anyone have any knowledge on high temp plastics?

My first internship was a 3 month temporary internship at a steel rolling factory. They are a German based company and this plant was the first one they've opened in the US, so I started working before they even made a finished roll. I did a lot of quality work and worked with my boss to get the lab up to spec for ISO 9001 certification. It was a good job, but it was pretty much all quality work and no project work because the company that built all the machinery kept their own technicians on site to deal with issues and my company just let them deal with it.

I managed to get a new internship right after my 3 months was up at the previous one. I've been at this new place for a little over a year now and I do a lot more engineering work. We make hygiene products and my work ranges from 3D modeling parts for the machines, doing cost saving analysis/lean manufacturing, and doing some grunt work like writing reports for other engineers.

I was offered a position as a manufacturing engineer once I graduate at an aluminum manufacturing plant this past week and I accepted it.

71,Question re: multiplexers and multiple analog inputs,1523150392,"Hello,

I am currently leading a section of the electronics team for a student club at my school. We are using an Arduino microcontroller to analyze sensor readings. 

I am a 2nd year EE student, and so while I may be somewhat confident in my theoretical understanding of electronics, I'm not confident in my foresight to see ""practical obstacles."" (i.e I spent a semester learning *how* to implement circuits. But I've spent 3 days actually building circuits). 

So, we need to read 16 analog readings. Each reading must be recorded every ~1-1.5 seconds. (Really it's ~50 readings, but if we can implement it for one MUX, we can do it for 5 lol)

Since Arduino have &lt;10 analog pins, we need to use Muxers. Our current design is to implement a 4-bit MUX (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9056)

Each sensor will be connected to its own analog input on the MUXer. The MUX's analog output will be connected to an analog pin on the Arduino. 

We'll use 4 pins on the Arduino as the selector bits for the Muxers. That is, they'll go from 0000 to 1111 and then roll over. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Questions**

1) Say we count up with the selector bits every 50ms. Does there need to be a delay between when we count up the selector bit and when we read the analog pin? In other words, does the ""switch"" from input 0 to input 1 happen instantaneously, or must we wait X amount of time? 

2) Will any issues arise with using the same 4 digital selector bits for multiple MUXers? 

3) Are there any other issues that we should worry about? 

Thank you!

I am currently researching methods for providing some assurance of data integrity by taking dissimilar sensor data (ie, from two different but related types of sensor) and corroborating the data between them and from that infer if one of them has been tampered with or is providing suspect information.

For example - pump motor speed and gas flow. They're directly related and therefore if I have a non-zero gas flow reading but the pump motor says 0 rpm then there's an issue. Either deliberate or through a fault.

Then taking that a step further, as the two are related and both are continuous variables - then changes in one will result in changes in the other. So if one changes the other should too. If one doesn't change then this could be the result of a re-play attack - where the data is replayed from a previous point in time and does not reflect the real current value.

With that in mind, and with the varied industries represented here do you have any sensor data where two or more sensor types are related?

My first idea was to use old CD drives - that's just about the perfect kind of motion, but they're quite loud - I don't need them to move particularly quick (a couple seconds would be fine) but I am trying to keep things completely silent and inexpensive as possible.

I can get motors easily convert that to linear motion, and that was my initial approach to the problem. Recently, however, I discovered ""flexinol"" or ""muscle wire"" which can exert a couple pounds of force (according to the spec sheet) which should be sufficient. Does anybody have experience with this material?

Are there any other (preferably cheap) silent methods of converting electricity to motion? Again, I don't care how I have to mount things - I'm still just exploring and trying to not get tunnel-vision'd into a specific solution to accomplish this objective.",AskEngineers,Snipeye,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8ado45/silent_methods_of_using_electricity_to_create/

4,How can I build an affordable near-infrared spectroscopy system?,1523050979,"Hi engineers! MS in BME here. I have previously employed functional near\-infrared spectroscopy \(fNIRS\) to control brain\-computer interfaces. I've been working in brain and spine surgery for the last 6 years and am a bit out of touch, and today I'm working on a system to sort materials for a non\-profit organization.

I've identified research confirming that this sorting is possible using NIRS. However, I have a limited budget for the project, and I'm going to implement the spectroscopy by myself, which is new territory for me.

My first thought was to use an off\-the\-shelf CCD and as many discrete\-wavelength IR LEDs I could find, but it seems that I can only source LEDs in two IR wavelengths. So, I'm thinking I'll need to use a broadband near\-IR source and employ a prism or something at the sensing end.

This brings me to my questions:

\+ What are typical broadband near\-IR \(roughly 750 \- 1,500 nm\) sources? Are any of these affordable? I don't need it to be large, or exceptionally bright.

\+ How do I go about performing the spectroscopy with an off\-the\-shelf CCD or CMOS sensor? Do I need multiple sensors and a literal, physical prism? Is there a better alternative?

I was able to get a lot of info from that post, so I'm hoping for a little more help here.

I am using the same general rack design, but I have been asked to cut cost significantly - as is typical.

To cut cost, I am considering switching to a C4x5.4# or 7.2# C-channel. The rack is also getting smaller so the span will be around 107"" instead of the 126"" original. Switching from tube to C-channel, Im worried about the twist that would be generated on the members from the downward force on the non-symmetrical cross-section. How would I calculate or compensate for that effectively?

13,Is it possible to convert a RWD car from a traditional transmission to a rear mounted transaxle? If so what would be involved in doing that conversion.,1523041939,"Title lays it out pretty well, I couldn’t really find much on the internet about swapping from a transmission to a transaxle. For this example let’s just say we’re using a 1997 Nissan 240sx/s14 and I want to swap from a standard transmission to a transaxle what would I need? 

Is it just a matter of sourcing the right transaxle from another platform and mating it to the right adapter plate on the engine and then getting all the other miscellaneous stuff installed?

Why would I want to do this some ask? Well I’m a big fan of time attack racing, hill climb, and circuit and road racing in general, so I was wondering if in a light weight RWD car (1997 240sx/s14 Nissan in this ex) that weighed 2300lbs/1050kg with a power output of 600bhp-750bhp traction really becomes an issue even with a well sorted aero package and down force.

So with that being said I was thinking what if you did a conversion to a rear mounted transaxle and got some weight over the rear wheels with maybe the fuel cell and a rear mounted radiator and some other auxiliary components mounted in the rear or mid/rear section of the car and also rear aero and down force as well, if that would help solve the traction issue, improve weight bias/distribution, and generally increase performance in a positive way. 

I hope I worded this correctly and articulated it in a good manner. Thanks for your input, opinion, response, etc! I appreciate it

25,I didn't get promoted to Senior Engineer because of politics,1523029367,"Throwaway account. 

So I'm an EE working for a small publicly traded aerospace company (~250 employees) in upstate NY. It's an understaffed company with daily emergencies. I have 5 years of experience and am 31 years old. I've been at this company my entire career (started school late). I've always been motivated and have always taken risks in my career that others will not (through designs mostly). 

In January of 2017 I asked for a significant raise,  roughly 10% because I was pretty much fed up with the company as a whole and it is possible management knew that. Management gave me a fuss about it at first and then finally gave me the raise.  **Then** they inform me they are also promoting me to Senior Project Engineer.

*Here's where it gets shady*

The following week, I'm brought into a conference room by my manager(for whom I have a great deal of respect) and I'm asked not to tell anyone about my promotion because there is another person they are trying to line up for promotion to Senior Engineer. There are only 16 design engineers at my company so I definitely know who they were talking about. So I say okay and proceed with my life for the next 14 months **wondering when the announcement of my promotion will ever be announced to the rest of the company**. At this point, at least my title has been changed according to Human Resources. 

Now some background on this other engineer who was also ""supposed to be promoted"". Let's call him John. This guy is a *real pleasure* to work with. He is roughly my age,  but has been at the company for a total of 10 years,  which is 5 years longer than me. This guy does not deal with problems that are nearly as difficult in scope as I do, has a reputation that involves streaming videos at work, not working overtime, and basically just copy-pasta everything every other engineer in the company does and says. It got so bad that when we renovated the office and everyone moved back in, they put his cubicle directly facing our manager's! I hope John is reading this because I still don't think he understands!

Anyway, back to the promotion. **It's now April of 2018 and nobody in the company has any idea that I'm actually a Senior Engineer.** I had my Annual Performance Review this week and multiple instances on my review said ""since Nick has been promoted to Senior Engineer last year, his work has been held to a higher standard...blah blah blah."" So I open my mouth and said to my manager,  ""So since I am being held to a higher standard as a Senior Engineer now...don't you think my title should be public knowledge?"" My manager responds by acting surprised that the notice never went out that I was promoted. He said ""What happened last year was we were going to make another guy Senior Engineer and the notices were supposed to go out at the same time, but we wound up not promoting him."" 

Now I know he is talking about John. John didn't get a promotion so now they're probably concerned that John might quit if John finds out someone with less tenure and experience was promoted before him. My manager reassures me that he will talk to the VP to get it sorted out. I still don't believe him. Then I ask my manager if my promotion was only an accounting exercise to get me the money I asked for, since I had asked for so much (I knew I asked for a lot because my company does not like giving out more than ~3% annually and my company is run by accountants). I told him I didn't care if that were true, I just wanted to know so that at some point I could feel like I have earned my title as Senior Engineer. My manager declined, said that wasn't the case, and said that he totally felt that I had earned it.

If my promotion does not go public, the company has put themselves in a position where now I feel as if I have nothing to work toward. I feel bad for other young engineers that start at this company looking to expand their careers and make headway. Our company just does not have that departmental structure one should be able to go through to achieve Engineer I,  Engineer II,  Engineer III...etc. even though we are an $8B publicly traded corporation. 

It's also possible the news of my promotion could also bring up some bad feedback from some other Senior Engineers.

Does anyone think they actually meant to promote me? Should I leave?

TLDR; Asked for a raise last year,  instead got promoted on paper, company never made it public knowledge. Was asked to keep it hush hush because another engineer with more experience and tenure (incompetent) was also supposed to get promoted. One year later and the other engineer did not get promoted. I asked about my promotion and now I don't think they ever meant to really give me one in the first place.

34,Should I quit my first job already?,1523012887,"Quick background story: I recieved my bachelor's of engineering in 2016 in Canada. I am born and raised Canadian but am Japanese biracial and speak Japanese pretty well. I was hired by a Japanese company to be an engineer, with the stipulation that I would be sent to japan for a 2-3 year training period.

I arrived in Japan in January 2017, and the whole ordeal has been pretty disappointing. I won't bother listing everything but im going to try to summarise some key reasons why.

I was told that I would be considered a new employee in japan therefore I would be compensated the same as a new employee would be there. In USD I am making roughly 30k a year, which Im almost 100% sure is far below what I should be making with my educational background and language skills. ( I don't think I am anything special, but this is far below industry standard for mechanical engineering) I also found out that I am actually  being paid less than new employees in japan, and when I brought this up with my  employer I was given a bunch of excuses  as to why my situation is different, even though we had an agreement on paper. I should add that I have a company car and my housing is partially subsidized, but even with these perks I am having a hard time saving any money as cost of living here isn't exactly low. I am pretty upset with the fact that I was misled when it comes to compensation. There are a few other things I was told/promised that didn't end up being true either, but I don't want to  waste everyone's time listing every little thing.

When it comes to the job itself, I find myself either bored with nothing to do or performing mundane tasks. I am having a hard time with the cultural differences in the workplace to pair with the fact that I feel under stimulated with my job. 

Which brings me to my point. Should I quit my job and move back to Canada? I have tried negotiating getting transferred back but they're not to keen on getting me out of here anytime soon. I am feeling slightly betrayed by my company and I feel like I should move on to something where I can at least feel a sense of accomplishment at work and recieve a salary that is atleast close to industry standards in my home country. My only issue is I don't want to make myself unnatractive to recruiters, as I am bailing on a job that sent me abroad after a little over a year. I also don't feel like I've gained enough new skills as I haven't exactly been doing much meaningful work. I am worried because my only fallback plan is to go back to working construction which I did as a summer job during university. (Which pays well but I don't want to do it forever).

Does anyone have any opinions on how recruiters will see me? Will I be able to explain my reasoning for quitting to future recruiters or will I just sound entitled? I am very stressed out as I have student loans to pay and I am starting to burn out mentally and emotionally. I don't want to ruin my future career because I couldn't handle another year in my current situation.

40,Composite Elevon/Aileron trailing edge bonding method,1522980054,"How would one go about assembling the trailing edge on a composite elevon/aileron?

I know one method is to simply bond the upper and lower skins together at the point they meet at the end of the trailing edge. Unfortunately, this method is prone to cracking or delaminating.

In the past, I've assembled trailing edges large enough that allowed me to design a spar (or wedge). The top of the spar bonded to the upper skin, and the bottom to the lower skin. 

This time, the trailing edge is incredibly narrow, so I can't fit a sort of wedge or spar to couple the skins together. 

How would you go about bonding an incredibly narrow trailing edge together? Essentially the airfoil is ramping down to a single edge that creates the trailing edge. Maybe somehow filling it with an expanding foam?

57,Post grad plans advice,1522948947,"Let me know if there's a more appropriate subreddit to ask this question, like /r/engineeringstudents or /r/askacademia

I'm a senior BME/EE graduating this year that is fortunate enough to have two appealing post grad options but I've been having trouble deciding on which one to focus on. I would like to know your thoughts about my situation. 

As background, I'm interested in a career in R&amp;D ideally in the medical device space, whether its in academia or industry or some other lab. To achieve this, I applied to master's and doctorate programs and managed to get into some good schools, one of which that I think would be awesome to attend for a particular advisor and their research project. However, by luck I also managed to land a summer internship at a university-affiliated research lab that does a lot of interesting government-funded work. The project itself is also relevant to my research interests, and from what I remember the researcher interviewing me mentioned potential for part-time work during the school year. I'll mention that since I'm graduating, I would be completing a MS the next academic year which made me eligible for the internship in the first place due to having graduate (either at university or other grad school) student status. While its obviously not guaranteed, many folks I know who work at this lab get return offers so I believe it would be likely to work there after finishing a MS. To sum it up, I'm trying to figure out how to proceed within the next week/before 4/15 by these paths:

1) Commit to the PhD in BME. I really liked my first impression of my choice advisor and their project is really interesting and impactful and would allow me to get a strong skillset in signal processing/machine learning which is relevant to both BME and EE. They've only had a few graduate students since they're a fairly young professor so its hard to tell about post-grad options. However, my impression of the school for some other aspects wasn't that great as the city the school is situated in is definitely smaller than places I've lived in and the weather was more harsh, which I think showed in some of the grad student's mood during the visit weekend. I think I would acclimate to living there but can't deny that the winters there would have an impact.

2) Stay for another year at my university for a MS in EE and try to work at the research lab afterwards. It seems like a more risky move since I won't know how this summer goes, and consequently won't know whether I like working there or if I get a return offer or not, but I also would only have to do one more year of schooling and would have the chance to earn more than a doctorate student's stipend. Even though its not really meaningful, I've always been interested in working at this lab during the summer but have not had luck landing a spot there until this year. For doing the MS, I'd also would be able to focus on learning signal processing and control theory and have more flexibility in employment options as EE even though I want to pursue medical device-related work. I'm fortunate enough to not have to worry about funding the MS but I do aim to supplement finances with TA'ing.

A vacuum at 1 atmosphere of pressure  has potential energy right. As the surrounding air seeks equilibrium it exerts a force that could be captured.  

So in a sense you could use vaccum chambers as a kind of battery.  

If we had a space elevator that could drive traffic up and down at the same time, using the downward momentum to offset the cost of raising cargo on the other side. 

So an array of vacuum batteries could be raised into space (offset by the energy of the batteries coming down). They are then ""Filled"" with vacuum by closing them while out of the atmosphere then lowered back to earth and when their deep in the atmosphere the potential energy of the vacumm is extracted and they are raised back up.

- 46"" wide hole = 12"" from the supports. (ideal width for the dogs)
- 34"" wide hole = 18"" (tight but doable)
- 22"" wide hole = 24"" (not big enough)

Additional information:

- This will be a space for the dogs to chill, not a playhouse.
- I have two dogs (husky and pit around that should reach 60lbs each) and they already love to run under the shed and lay in the dirt.
- The location is SE Florida. The ground is easy to dig in although we can never go too deep or we get wet.
- I'm open to adding additional concrete blocks to support this end of the shed.
- The base of the shed is, on average, 10"" above the ground.
- I'm interested in discussion around materials and drainage if anyone has ideas or experience.

82,Can anyone offer some advice in changing my career path as an Application Engineer in the Water/Wastewater Industry?,1522873360,"I work as an Application Engineer for a pump company that mostly specializes in the wastewater industry. We also do a lot of work with treatment plants and potable water booster systems as well. I am trying to figure out my next career move as I feel like it is time for a change and there is no room for further advancement in the company I work for. I have worked for this company for about 5 years now and was hired right out of college after completing my Civil and Environmental Engineering Degree. I have thought about changing fields, but haven't decided anything concrete. I work on electronics projects as a hobby and one of my favorite aspects about my current job is the electrical aspect of working with control panels, VFDs, motors, etc, so maybe something in the electrical field may not be out of the question. On the other hand the water industry seems like a good industry to be in right now as engineers in this field seem to be in high demand. I feel like I may have forgotten about 80% of the things I learned in college since graduating which I feel might be a problem going forward. I am not sure what I need to do to prepare before I start searching for another job. About the only thing I know for sure is that I want to move far from where I live right now (South Florida), ideally somewhere near the Pacific Northwest. Even if I don't change industry I do not want to look for another job as an Application Engineer. I would rather look for a position where I could do more design type engineering rather than application engineering. Since my only professional experience is working as an Application Engineer am I pretty much going to be stuck in this role? Any advice on how I can break out of that role?

85,IE with manufacturing/supply chain background into food industry?,1522868769,"I graduated with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering last May. My internships were mainly supply chain oriented and currently, I work in the automotive industry as a manufacturing engineer in a plant. I've recently become really interested in food (I honestly just love eating) and I read an article in NYT (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html) which really made me consider wanting to pursue a career in the food industry.

I enjoy analyzing things and that article talked about how they would basically conduct studies on people and how they react to different levels of different flavors, sugar, substances, whatever, and then analyze that data to find the most optimal combination. I think food is the most interesting subject to conduct these studies on just because the topic is so relatable... we all eat food every day and it's so interesting to see all the work that goes into it and efforts to try to make it healthier but still taste good. 

I've looked at some job postings at big food companies and a lot of the positions that I'm qualified for are basically things I'm doing now... essentially process engineer positions where I'm working with the production lines/machines to make things more efficient. I would really be interested in working with the food directly and conducting similar studies on finding optimal flavors and such. I don't have a lot of experience in the real world with data analytics (I am trying to get more at my current job as I asked to be put on more projects that require me to analyze data) and I am not super skillful in excel, R, minitab or any programming language (this is purely my fault... never had the motivation to actually learn these in college).

What are my options for finding a job like this? My dad was in market research and this seems almost like that so not really engineering? Would I even have the qualifications and if not, what would I have to learn in order to even be considered for a job like this? I have a pretty good salary at my current position and I'm curious about what my pay would be if I were to take up a job like this?

So you do some destructive testing on that joint. But how many samples do you need to test? How do you prove that number of samples you've tested is statistically significant?

This is important in medical device development (and I'm sure many other industries) as the regulations and standards state that you need to have a statistically based sampling plan. Does anyone have much experience in this? Any resources or standards anyone can recommend?

I know that the plan needs to take a risk-based approach; i.e. the higher risk of a joint failing, the more samples you should test, to gain more confidence. But I'm struggling to convert that risk (say from a dFMEA) into a number of samples.

90,"How much strength is lost when a cross-brace is not directly below the member it is supporting, but is offset, with a plate connecting the cross-brace to the member?",1522855729,"I'm drafting a simple, rectangular, 4 column, steel platform to hold some mechanical equipment. Due to some stuff being in the way, one of my cross-braces won't fit. I want to do an offset cross-brace, welded to some plates that are then bolted or welded to my main platform members. Does this work at all? The off-set idea came from the ""engineer"" on this job...but he doesn't have a stamp, and gets his boss to stamp anything he does. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that the boss-will fully review it, and that I don't need to worry about the structural integrity. At the same time, while I am no engineer, I'm a little worried about this design. At the moment the member sizes and bolts are all the same as at the regular cross-braces, which to me seems insufficient. So, how much weaker is this than a typical cross-brace?

I've roughly drawn it out below. The Horizontal members will be I-beams, the columns and cross- braces will be HSS's. All steel.

25,How much should I charge as a freelance consultant for design and NRTL prep services in a highly specialized field of engineering?,1522784990,"I recently quit my job as a Certification Engineer in a very specialized field for an NRTL.  A former client from my time at said NRTL has reached out to me to discuss the potential for me to work with them as a consultant.  

I no longer have any influence over their certifications and NRTLs are not allowed to officially consult on design decisions (thus I'm not competing with them directly) so I believe that ethically I'm in the clear there.  

However, I have no idea of how much to charge for something like this.  I know that the NRTL I worked for based their quotes on an hourly rate of $400 per hour.  

On the one hand I don't know that it makes sense for me to charge that rate considering that if the client is going to pay that they might as well just hire the NRTL by the hour.  

On the other hand, the NRTL isn't actually allowed to help them make design decisions and having a consultant who has insight on what is and isn't going to be a problem during certification could save them numerous hours with the NRTL and prevent project delays. This field is very complicated (Hazardous Locations), and there are a lot of gotchas that are easy to fix in the beginning of a design cycle but would cause a total redesign if caught at the NRTL stage.  

I don't want to undervalue myself, but I also don't want to set my rate so high that I turn them off of working with me.

43,Why is (was) converting a program from 32 to 64 bit a challenge?,1522740409,"This may not be so much an issue any more, but at one point - specifically when 64 bit processors and OSes began to roll out - I recall there being a lot of complaining about converting 32 bit applications to a 64 bit architecture. Even now you can still find a number of applications that run in 32 bit mode.

My question is why is this such an issue?

In my experience programming, all I’d need to do to convert my application from 32 to 64 bit is change the appropriate settings to compile my code in to a 64 bit binary. The code itself wouldn’t need any changes. Loops and conditionals aren’t going to change how they behave. I could just make the change for the next update, or offer two versions for users who can’t use a 64 bit OS.

Are there (legitimate?) design decisions you can make while developing that assumes a certain type of architecture? If so, what might be an example? I suppose if you were using integer over/underflow, or maybe bitshifting then you assume something about the width of a number - but is that really in widespread enough use to cause so many problems?  I’d assume those issues would show up mostly in things that interfaced with hardware, for example, which definitely doesn’t encompass all the things I saw this with.

44,[bad decisions] how close to impossible would a garage build hybrid be?,1522734409,"I'd like to answer a few questions before I begin. 1)are you insane? Yes. Moving on. 2)what the fuck is wrong with you? A lot. 3)you know you're not right in the head, right? Yes. We've established this. Now we can get to the point.

So, I was looking at porn. Particularly the Caterham (Lotus, really) super 7. It's a kit build car commonly powered by a 1 litre motorcycle engine. This got me day dreaming, wondering about the possibilities of a home built hybrid. I'm thinking either parallel or micro. 

So, to catch you up on what I'm thinking: I'd either start with a junk yard find with a straight chassis, and strip everything except suspension, brake system, and steering. Possibly leave the driveline. It would have to be something older, to avert the power steering &amp; abs mess. Alternately, start with someone's old dune buggy to reduce the work load.

From there, I'd use something like an older BMW K bike engine (inline 4, fuel injected, shaft drive, turbo options). This engine features an alternator capable of 80 amps. Out of the transmission housing is a small shaft (couple inches) designed to accept a sliding shaft with a U joint to the drive shaft. Now, I think I can either mount a pulley or a sprocket on the drive shaft from the engine (carefully centered, obviously. Yes, I know that's not easy. No, I know that idea you think I have won't work. Not doing that. Can we move on?). From there, and however I mount the engine to the frame, I think I could mount an electric motor beside it and attach that to the shaft by chain or belt. I'm leaning towards belt, because in an incident that'll burn up and/or shred. Chains aren't so forgiving. Also, centripetal clutch on the motor, so I'm not just spinning it wildly for nothing. 

For control, I'm thinking some form of potentiometer matched to whatever motor I find. It'll be engaged by an interuptor switch on the accelerator (going with a pedal), so releasing throttle disengages the motor. I'd like to keep it simple there, so that most likely failure of switch results in circuit open. I assume at 80 amps, whatever motor I end up with will drain faster than it charges at full power, so that's what the potentiometer is about. Alternately, I could add a relay to one of the engine management systems (super simple management system. Could map it with a crayon) so it only kicks on at higher revs like an electronic turbo, maintaining precise engine control at low speed and charging the batteries.

So, if you made sense of any of that, what am I forgetting? And on a scale of 1-10 just how bad of an idea is it? (oh, yes, adding that I'd use an automotive 12v AGM battery. Old school alternators and lithium don't play nice, go boom).",AskEngineers,ADirtyThrowaway1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/89acxw/bad_decisions_how_close_to_impossible_would_a/

Computer Simulation: A first course in computer simulation. A project based course emphasizing the rigorous development of simulation applications. Topics will include random number generation, Monte Carlo simulation, discrete event simulation, and the mathematics behind their proper implementation and analysis. To a lesser extent we may discuss, time-step simulations and parallel simulations. The course uses journaling, programming projects and exams for assessment.

Computer Vision: Computer vision is the process of using computers to acquire images, transform images, and extract symbolic descriptions from images. This course provides an introduction to this field, covering topics in image formation, feature extraction, location estimation, and object recognition. Design ability and hands-on projects will be emphasized, using popular software tools. The course will be of interest both to those who want to learn more about the subject and to those who just want to use computer imaging techniques.

Machine Learning: The goal of machine learning is to build computer systems that improve automatically with experience, which has been successfully applied to a variety of application areas, including, for example, gene discovery, financial forecasting, and credit card fraud detection.

51,Roof joist weight limit and hanging a static load,1522714437,"I'm looking for some input here. I have two stand-up paddleboards that I would like to store up and out of the way in my garage. The idea is to use a small electric winch I have to slowly lift the two boards up until they're essentially right up against the joists. They'd be hung slightly off-center from center of the garage, and would not really experience any strong sudden loads. The boards would have 2 2x4 struts, one at the front, one at the back, to spread the weight some. Cables would tie into each corner of the 2 struts to further help spread the load and ensure the boards are level. A few pulleys would be used to redirect cables to meet up with main winch cable, but no reduction through pulleys is planned for (light load, no real need). 

Specs (Vague for now until I can get back later this week to do measurements):
Garage - Standard American 2-car garage. Wooden frame building, built likely around 1960-ish. About 22ft deep x 24ft wide.  Joists are 2x4, and are joined by a plate halfway into the garage (roughly 11ft). Joists run front-to-back.
Paddleboards: 53 lbs each. 124in long x 33in wide x 6in high.
Winch: 1500lb capacity. Will likely be anchored to concrete floor near back wall of garage. Single cable from winch will tie into 2-4 smaller cables that will lift each corner of the paddleboards.

So, the main input I'm seeking is whether or not this can be supported with the roof structure unmodified. The load would be pretty static, no sudden shocks. Boards would likely be raised and lowered about 2-3 times a year. I have a bit of room to scoot the anchor points around the garage if needed to lessen the stresses, but it's preferred to keep them on the right side of the garage, near the center (in terms of forward/backward). This would mean the center plate joining the two joist sections would be straddled by the two boards. There is no other real weight on any of the joists, only a few boxes of Christmas lights, a tent, and a few beach chairs. This all sits atop a few old hollow-core doors. At the very back, near the wall, there are hanging shelves, with a total load of about 150lbs. max, holding various small tools/odds and ends.

The thing is the gpu works. 

I was running an GPU Stress Test 

https://gyazo.com/c24353f597a50959436cce8057bc6c18

As you can see there is an problem with ""limite tensão"" ( Tension Limit ) &amp; ""Tensão da GPU V"" (  GPU Tension ) one shows 0 and other one shows 0.8 mv Kappa.

Maybe the problem is the 3 of the capacitors are missing check down

https://gyazo.com/927f7e25442f2d9473bb6d8d972f0d88

3 of them. 

Right now as the teste were been made the problem is the 3 cap missing , and i need to buy them i was thinking to buy an ( CAP CER 0.1UF 16V X7S 0201 ) 10% Tolerance metric 0603 but so many people are ordering that and there is no stock right now. 

So i need to find another for the gpu 0201 ( metric 0603 ) max temp 125°C 4v-16v. 

As you can see in the chip image they are so so small i think they are a GRM Low Voltage MLCC.

Are they 0.3 mm? 

How many capacitance than can be? 0.1 uf haves 0 stock. 

So i found that 16VDC haves no stock 10VDC too , but 6.3 VDC there is 2 of them with stock alot of them.

I'm in my mid-30's now, and have begun paying attention to the alumni association of my college. I donated a few hundred dollars to a student scholarship fund that I benefited from when I was a student, and there is also a scholarship dinner coming up pretty soon that I've been invited to.

It's a fundraising dinner, and each plate is over $500 (affordable to me, but not chump change). Like most engineers, I don't exactly socialize with others as much as I could, and my wife thinks that I should get out there and press the flesh a little. My college has many alumni in my industry and I frankly could only benefit by networking more.

If you're looking for engineers to interview for a school assignment or for your job hunt, this is the right place! The AskEngineers community has compiled a list of hundreds of practicing engineers across different countries, industries, and specializations to help answer your questions about what they do in their job, how they got there, and offer career advice to those that need it.

**Note:** Please be courteous when requesting an interview. Everyone on the list is doing it on a volunteer basis only, and they are not obligated to respond or help you. Our users reserve the right to deny any requests for interviews and/or personal information. Harassment will not be tolerated and will be reported to the authorities.

###How to use this list

1. `Ctrl + F` the engineering discipline, country (e.g. US, UK, Germany, etc.), or other criteria you're looking for looking for. If you need to be able to verify someone's identity, search for ""Available for e-mail?: yes""

1. Parse through each search result and message 2-3 users that you think will be able to answer your questions. **Please DO NOT shotgun PMs to every user!** If you don't intend to interview everyone, don't waste their time by sending messages that you won't respond to later.

###Interested in conducting interviews?

By signing up, you're volunteering to let high school students, prospective engineers, and new graduates PM or e-mail you with interview questions. Typically with students it will be for a class assignment (i.e. Intro to Engineering), so questions will be about about work, how you got into engineering, ""do you have any advice for..."", etc. Think of yourself as a STEM Ambassador. You will receive anywhere from 1-4 requests per month on average, with some surges in January, July, August, and December due to new and graduating students. While these lists usually have over 100 sign-ups and is set to contest mode, which prevents the same users from getting bombarded with requests, engineers in an in-demand discipline may get more requests than average.

####How much time does it take?

The first interview you do will take about 1 hour, depending on how detailed you are. After that, most interviews will take &lt; 30 minutes because you can copy-paste answers for repeat or very similar questions. That said, please be sure to read every question carefully before using previously written answers. It's your call on how personal or impersonal you want to be in your answers

####How do I sign up?

Copy the template below and post a top-level comment below. **Note:** ""Available for e-mail"" means you're OK with the interviewer sending you a personal e-mail to conduct the interview, usually for verification purposes. If you want to stick to reddit PM only, answer 'no' to this question.

However, whenever I hear people talk about it, they always do so in terms of efficiency (i.e. SSME had a 99% c* efficiency). What is meant by this? I assume that the equation in the textbook is a ""theoretical value"", so your actual characteristic velocity will be less than this value -- but how is actual characteristic velocity measured? It is a function of nozzle stagnation pressure (i.e. total pressure in the chamber), throat area, and mass flow rate. 

What I don't understand is, how 'actual' values for any of these things will be any less than the theoretical value. You can set your mass flow rate of propellants, and also set your chamber pressure based on the pressure drop across your injector. 

The textbook does make a few assumptions; one being that the velocity at the injector plane = 0, and another assuming that the gas in the chamber is an ideal gas -- but I still don't understand how these things affect the calculation of characteristic velocity.

So thermal conductivity is about how well a material will conduct heat, which means it has a higher rate of heat transfer between the material and surroundings. My question is probably pretty dumb, but simply, if there is a high rate of heat transfer in, there will also be a high rate of heat transfer out, i.e a material with high thermal conductivity will heat up quickly (Qin) and cool down (Qout) just as quickly?

I want to run them at low voltage (ca. 5V), low speed, high torque (&gt;5 kg/cm) and I want to keep track of the motor's torque as well as the shaft orientation as accurately as possible! Those two measurements should give me the work performed over time. My goal is to keep track of the total Energy that the actuator deposits / removes from an attached pendulum system (swinging at ~1 Hz). - Basically I want to use a pendulum as a low frequency oscillating circuit :)

Hence, I'd also like to monitor ""negative work"" transmitted back from the shaft. Theoretically, at least some of the momentum energy of the system should be induced back as electrical current to the motor on each pendulum swing. Can I measure (and, to correct for friction, amplify) this with a driver chip in operation (or is there a trick, such as disabling/shorting the driver off during intermediate measurement intervals)? Does the driver type (transistor/diode, DAC/PWM, etc) affect the necessary sample- and control rates for metering and correcting the effectively applied actuator force and power?

I read somewhere that current-driven DC brushless motors (maybe along with current sensing circuits) should be able to apply precise torque control around 0 RPM (high holding torque), or am I totally on the wrong track here? Monitoring three phases and driving them individually seems a bit complicated though. Are there better motors for this (with good current/torque characteristics)? How many wires would I have to tap for a certain kind of system? For example, could I monitor linear magnetic actuators or stepper motors in a similar way?

Gearings would have too much friction loss I'm afraid - this would only further complicate any attempt at measurement - especially of backfeeding - energy.

Also, I'd be happy to hear about any such motors / control boards that are easily available from EU (especially ones that also have integrated rotary encoders and handle the grey-codes internally). [Here](http://www.smc-powers.com/English/Product/gimbal/) is an example of what I was thinking of - but I'm unsure if those are the best / most affordable option.

On the other hand, even if I continue to study in my main university I will get as well the option to enroll in a master degree of my choice but I will not leave the country.

Now the question, should I take the scholarship and seize the opportunity to leave the country where wages are higher and the whole thing of traveling, meeting new people, etc and study something I don't like for a year, or should I stay in my country and study something I like and I risk not being paid well.

Here's the thing: I honestly feel like I'm going to be a horrible engineer. I am not very good with solidworks and nor am I very good with programming. I get to work with solidworks consistently at work but I am slow and sometimes my work is inaccurate. I usually work under a lot of pressure as I am consistently pumping out parts for the company and I am kind of tired of being yelled at for being ""too slow"". The thing is I honestly enjoy working with programming software and solidworks, but I'm just not very good at it.

I have also worked 24-30 hours a week during semesters, and a full time schedule over the breaks since freshman year to put myself through school so I have lacked the time necessary to really apply these tools to things I'm truly interested in. I am very envious of the students that have been able to spend their breaks working on personal projects because I feel like that's where a lot of learning is reinforced.

I do well in school because I work hard and I enjoy the reward of doing well, but I feel as though it is by any means a reflection of my intelligence.

39,Graduating English major (22f) wanting to pursue a career in Environmental Engineering. Will I need to complete another undergrad degree or do I have other options?,1522386108,"As the title says, I’m graduating with a BA in English concentration in Creative Writing in 4 weeks, and recently I’ve decided that I want to be an Environmental Engineer (lol). I’ve always had a passion for the environment, and now I want to use my brain to solve the problems it’s facing. I’ve done some preliminary research and from what I’ve gathered environmental engineers mainly deal with water-treatment and waste-management. I think that eventually, I’d like to design and create technology that reduces pollution and benefits animals (specifically in the ocean). However, that would be a long-term goal. I’m fine with going the water-treatment route until I can get my masters in a more focused field and learn more about green technology/engineering. 

So, some background about me. I know some may read English major and think horrible I’m at math and science, but that isn’t the case. I went to a STEM high school and was in the BioMedical track which was interesting. I also took a lot of math classes. And in my senior year, I took calc 1-3 I and did alright. I could quickly pick up new concepts and got A’s and B’s on the in-class tests. But because I told myself I was going to be a writer (lol) and didn’t need calc, I didn’t study and didn’t do well on the AP exam to get the credit. So, intensive math and science don’t scare me. I know I can do it if I put the effort in and study. 

I’m also graduating without any debt (thankyou scholarships, community college, and mom and dad), so I’m not in a horrible place financially. I’m just unsure of my next steps. I’ll be moving out of state by the end of May, and I’m essentially done with my degree save for one elective class, so switching majors isn’t an option. Do I have no other option but to do another undergraduate program? I’m not against that, as a matter of fact, I believe that is inevitable. However, I’d like to know if there is an alternative path. I know I need to retake all my calc classes (probably precalc) and some science classes but what else do I need? There is so much information that it’s difficult to process it all. 

Additional Questions
1.	What are some good online courses that’ll help me learn the basic principles of engineering? What are those basic principles? 

2.	Would you recommend getting my environmental engineering degree online? (Though I’d prefer to do it in person.) 

3.	Since I have my BA in English would it be possible to skip the humanities portion if I were to do undergrad again, and just do the math and science part? 

4.	If I went and did night classes or some other remedial program for the math and science would I be able to apply directly to a master’s program? 

5.	What advice would you give to someone starting from scratch in the engineering field?/ Is there anything else I should consider? 

TL;DR: Graduating English Major, will I need to go through undergrad again? Also, see additional questions.

40,I think my engineering career is over,1522385682,"Current bosses are unethical. I've tried to go up the chain and they've verbally harassed me. No viable HR. Two weeks away from testing and they have multiple critical design errors they've refused to listen to me about (PS, a new coworker was hired and voiced my same concerns to my bosses in a closed room before even meeting me four months ago). Turns out I'm not in an engineering role - I'm in a consulting role - and I have no control over anything. However, when this fails miserably, I am the resident expert so I bear all of the liability.

I received another offer in my field - really the only other position open. They were pretty generous - $15k raise, $5k sign on bonus, reimbursed move, pay last two months of my lease. However, every single one of these benefits is actually subject to income tax. And no moving costs are tax deductible in 2018. And all the reimbursements are subject to the new state's income tax (I'm moving from WA, 0% state income tax to CA, ~9.5%+ state income tax). All these benefits bumps my effective tax rate up to 40% if I move.

In the end, it'll take me over a half-year to make my out-of-pocket money back.

No jobs in my field. No way I can ethically stay at my current job. High probability I will need to report them to the customer to sleep at night (potential retaliation). No comfortable way I can move to CA (I hate CA and would want to move as soon as another opportunity arose - not feasible if I lose my savings heading down there).

41,Do continuing education courses help in the job search?,1522379871,"I recently finished my BSME and got a job at an HVAC contractor making only $20/hour.

43,Working onsite at a customer location...would it look bad to approach employees of customer to be references for a different job?,1522369536,"So a little background info to set the stage. I started out as a contractor for this customer back in 2015 and worked onsite with them for 2 years before the customer's upper management decided to cancel the contract with my actual employer. It happened pretty quick and it wasn't because of anything us lowly engineers did. It was political, basically. When I left, I spoke with my immediate supervisor and manager (customer's employees) and they wished me well and agreed to be references for me in the future. No hard feelings at all and left on good terms with them. 

Well I get moved back to my actual employer's location for a year doing some work and I'm overall not too happy so I start applying around. I apply to a dream job of mine several months ago and put down my old bosses from the customer as references. I didn't hear back so I kind of forgot about it. During that time, I get wind that the old customer wants us back onsite for a little while to get a new project up and going with them. I'm chosen to go back onsite and kickstart this project because I have excellent rapport with the customer already. This was about 2 months ago that I started back onsite, btw.

Now this past week, dream job comes calling out of nowhere and I do a phone interview with them that goes well. And now they want to contact my references...who work at the client company that I'm currently supposed to be helping. 

To me, it seems like I could be putting my references in an awkward spot by asking them to essentially make life harder on their company by allowing me to leave when I'm supposed to be helping them. I'm not technically working with those exact same guys anymore though so I wouldn't be directly impacting their work or projects. Still, it seems awkward at the very least.

44,[Mechanical] Linear slide bearing binding when oriented vertically,1522364144,"I'm noticing that when I have a linear slide oriented vertically, it tends to bind up. By this, I mean I'm noticing some on and off friction as I push the carriage along. It seems like the ball bearings in the track are piling up and rubbing against eachother.

I was worried that something like this could happen, but this is a brand new bearing, I wasn't expecting this behavior out of the box. I'm trying out using different greases, but haven't had much success so far. One thing that does seem to improve the performance (and support my piling theory) is when I introduce a load pushing the slide into the track, or a moment in the same plane as slide/track. This seems to introduce forces that hold the ball bearings in place in their track and not rub against eachother (at least that's my guess). The forces in this system are mainly in the direction of motion though, so introducing this force long term would require an additional spring/mount, which introduces more hardware - I'd strongly prefer not to go this route.

I'm personally not very experienced with these sorts of bearings, are there any experts out there who have seen this problem before who could shed some light on the best approach?

57,Working in private vs government,1522345531,"Hi there,

I'm a 26 yrs old mech engineer currently working in the energy efficiency consultant world. I have about 4 years of working experience in private and previously worked in government before when I was an intern.

I have an opportunity to switch to a capital improvement program for a large federal gov entity in my home town. The pay is about 6k higher. They rejected my asking at 10k higher. I think the job is less stress, stable, comes with a pension if you work for more than 10 years but at the same time slow moving and perhaps not much growth from what I heard. Work schedule is pretty fixed and I don't think it's very flexible.

My current job is perhaps my dream job (fun, smart people) but in the consultant world I feel like I work a lot more (currently salaried), more stress, and always hustle to get jobs. It is also very top heavy so a lot of my fees go into admin crap. The work has a lot of diversity and technically challenging, allowing me to work remote. However, I have seen my company fired or laid off people without warning for under performing team.


I was wondering if any senior engineers can give me some insight if they were making the switch to gov position and what their experience is like. Do you regret it?

58,What are the most important factors to prioritize when considering internships?,1522344993,"I have a good problem. I actually got offers from my first two internship choices. They are very different, and my curiosity about each is why they were my first choices. So what do I need to prioritize when choosing which one to accept? I am in the fourth year of my Civil degree with one year to go, and I have narrowed my intended career interests down to these structural and transportation. I am looking for an internship that suits my long term career goals obviously, but it will be equally useful for me in defining what those are. 

Internship #1:

-Structural design internship at a small company (~15 people)

-I am very interested in doing this kind of work as a career, and the small company size attracts me because I like to be involved with a whole project rather than specialize, and it has occurred to me that I may want to own my own company one day.

-I really enjoy my structures classes and the emerging technologies in the field interest me.

-Structural engineering seems less entangled in politics than transportation.

-Not a lot of field work, maybe once a week or less. 

-It is a 3 month internship over this summer.

-This option makes for ~1.5 hour long commute

Internship #2:

-Transportation design internship for the city BOT.

-Public work, which I am very curious about and extremely attracted to the benefits

-Have not taken any transportation engineering classes yet, but the concepts behind the work are very interesting to me

-I would get to work for the city in the heart of downtown (a good thing)

-About 50-50 field to office work (this sounds nice to me)

-This would be a 6 month internship, going through this summer and fall. It would further delay my graduation.

-These 6 months would count towards my work experience under a PE for my licensure.  

-This option makes for an easy ~30 min commute.

So here we are... I am pretty much equally interested/curious about a career in structural design as I am for transportation, maybe slightly more interested in structural right now, but not enough to determine my choice. I know that this is not exactly choosing my career or setting anything in stone, but of course I want to make the best move. Structural vs. Transport, public vs. private, heart of the city vs. the burbs, these questions came at me real fast! Any information, advice, experience, opinions, 2 cents, job market information, industry growth stats, or anything that I may want to consider is greatly appreciated!

70,How are crew capsule abort procedures triggered during a launch explosion?,1522305034,"How are crew capsule abort procedures triggered during a launch explosion?

Awhile back, the last time SpaceX lost a rocket during launch they claimed that the crew abort procedure would have safely jettisoned the capsule before harming hypothetical astronauts in a crewed scenario. Obviously a human monitoring the launch would not have been able to react quickly and reliably enough to trigger that sequence, so I am wondering what types of sensor data triggers the abort procedure and how they would avoid an expensive false positive?

I’m interested as a software engineer but I have no tangible experience with hardware and robotics outside of turning a servo on a raspberry pi. I imagine you would have a process running externally to the standard launch sequence/navigation processes that is monitoring data from heat, sound or perhaps air pressure sensors that could detect various effects of an explosion but I lack any real knowledge in this field so I can only speculate. 

I’ve only been able to find info about how the rockets and landing procedures work after the abort is triggered. I can see how abort could be triggered if telemetry veered too far off course, but I’m interested in the event of a sudden explosion like the SpaceX rocket. The main propulsion method itself is a controlled explosion so detecting an uncontrolled explosion reliably without false positives seems very challenging.

I assumed its because it changes the configuration of certain files for better performance, security and of course maybe new features to be added and for configurations to take effect it needs to be restarted.  ",AskEngineers,SmirdenByben,/r/AskEngineers/comments/87qsre/how_do_updates_work/
15,How to figure out flexing point of an uneven cross section?,1522231700,"Example: https://i.imgur.com/3kpQ0wp.png

In a simplified world if we assume that a regular thickness rib would bend in a circular manner around it's base if pushed from below, is there a way to figure out the center of the flex for a part that has a tapered/conical wall thickness?

It's my understanding that it should flex closer to the tip since it's thinner there, but is there a way to calculate it? At least roughly? Is there a rule of thumb for this? Like if the base is ""2x"" thick and the tip is ""x"" thick then the flexing point is midway?

So you know like how the bigger the disc, the faster the edge spins, bla bla bla. Well keep that in mind a sec.

Second part of the question is, the further the edge from the 'spinny bit' in the middle, would that have an adverse effect on the amount of 'torque' the motor can exert on the leading edge at different angles from parallel? 

Like does leverage come into play? Is there an mathematical optimal 'part' of the leading edge which would give the disc the best 'leverage' and force to cut through? Do parts of the blade with less 'leverage' lead to increased chances of the blade 'catching' or whatever?

What's the ratio of speed of the edge bit vs the 'torque' or whatever if that is the case? Is that a thing?

Is there some sorta 'maths voodoo' to figure out what the maximum optimal disc size is for different power motors?

Would that also dictate how 'course' your disc can be at different diameters based on that engine power? How easy it will be for that disc to catch instead of power through? Or what have you?

Due to the weight of marbles, these are going to weigh too much to easily transport, from my math, most of the sculptures will be ~30kg minimum.

Can transfer bearings be used similarly to castor wheels as long as the surface is smooth and hard? 

Do I have to worry about the weight of the sculpture having issues with the epoxy bonds created?

Is it feasible to create my own transfer bearings out of transparent material (glass or crystal) so that way it maintains transparency while being portable.

The other alternative is to create the sculptures in a method that is modular in design and able to be transported independently - this is easier to work with, but involves additional time per project in both the planning and execution phases - I'd rather try and master a transportation method that is built into the sculptures in a pleasing way, that I can master and then reproduce.

Double talk and misleading information designed to influence the home populations and legitimise the illegitimate has created a profound sense of distrust and uncertainty in the minds of most people. This is doubly so for immigrant populations like myself that are being asked to consider evidence against the homes of their parents and grandparents.

-  Bias runs rampant through our societies. It is incredibly difficult to know which experts are presenting the facts as they see them and which experts are working for a vested interest and pushing an agenda.

Disclaimer: People will have strong views on this subject. I am approaching this with the view that Iran is very likely involved in malicious acts of aggression in the region based on various evidence that I believe is irrefutable. What I am seeking is further irrefutable evidence from the experts on this sub, free of political leanings. I am asking you all for the facts as you know them and as experts in your field of study/work. The questions being asked here are done so in good faith with a desire to understand what is happening and who is involved.

On to the evidence:

https://www.defensenews.com/global/mideast-africa/2018/03/26/bombs-disguised-as-rocks-in-yemen-reportedly-show-iran-aid/

My questions in order of appearance in the video:

- The fin stabilisers: I've read in various news posts that this may be the only missile on the planet that does not have fin stabilisers. Why is this and why are the Iranians the only ones to produce missiles without this feature?

- Factory welding vs field welding: Do you agree with the assessment and would this be conclusive proof for you that it could not have come off the assembly line in that state?

- Why are the brands and quality control stamps in English? Would it not make more sense for these to be in Farsi? Is this a symptom of international standards being adopted globally?

- Why would the Iranians be so negligent to export arms that are covered in evidence pointing to their manufacturing origin? Is it so difficult to produce these components without branding?

- How difficult would it be to fabricate the evidence? Looking at the equipment from the boat and the nature of the off the shelf components, I cant help but feel that all that stuff could have been put together by anyone. Why are they not releasing the supporting evidence showing the collection of this evidence from the scene of the incident?

- As experts, you will have a much finer eye for the details. Please share any additional observations and evidence that you may have seen in the video but remain undiscussed. Please also share your questions that you yourselves would like further clarification on.

63,What makes a good engineer?,1522138361,"Hi everyone. I'm a 3rd year ME student and I have one year left until I graduate. I've got a decent GPA above a 3.5 (major) and I've had an internship for 12 months. I typically work 30 hours a week while I've been going to school and I've been wondering about what it takes to be a good engineer.

I don't feel like I'm the best in my classes and often find myself jealous about how easily people find engineering meshes with their interests. I have a lot of classmates that do their own projects and research beyond their classes and I wish I had the passion to do the same but to be honest often times when I get home I just want to play video games and go to bed. I fear I lack the creativity and passion to fuse engineering with my interests outside of school/work and I feel like it is hindering my ability to really apply what I'm learning to real projects. Even though I usually finish my courses at or near the top of the class, I feel like I've only gained theoretical knowledge and really lack the applications. I've seen students who pass the course with a C but know how to apply material better because they have the practical experience to relate to it.

I want to be a good engineer, but I don't want to eat, sleep, and breathe engineering all day everyday. I want to be curious and learn but lack the energy and money to pursue anything at the moment. I find that many of my class mates have great practical car knowledge and because of it they know a ton about different kinds of gears/crankshafts/engines and I can't even compare.

Do I lack the curiosity to be a good engineer? What even makes a good engineer?",AskEngineers,sweat-e-sac,/r/AskEngineers/comments/87gpnn/what_makes_a_good_engineer/
64,"""Innovation"" Project: Advice on three novel different ways to charge an electric car!",1522130828,"So I'm a first year university student working on this project in Innovation class (which is taught as vaguely as it sounds) and our group decided to focus on electric cars, and finding out why more people don't use them.

After doing some digging and interviews, we discovered that one of the biggest barriers for people to switch to electric was range anxiety (fear of car running out of electricity mid-journey) and charging inconvenience, especially with regards to charging time (around 30-60 minutes with public chargers, or 9+ hours overnight in a home charger).


My group is coming up with some ideas that could address this, and I've posted three below. Beside each idea I put the specific problem it was meant to address. Could you kindly choose which idea you think is the best out of 1-10 and why based on these criteria:


1) Feasibility 2) Effectiveness in addressing the charging problem


Idea 1: Slideable Charger, 
Problem addressed: Cars left charging in public spaces when the owner is at work/busy tend to remain taking up that charging space for way after the car has been fully charged. The idea is to have the charger be ""slideable"" across the wall so that other car owners can slide the chargers and charge their own cars once the other guy's car has been charged. I'm not sure about the physics behind it so it might be a load of crap but anyway, here's a (poorly drawn) diagram that might help you get the gist of it: https://goo.gl/aVye2h

Idea 2: Swappable Batteries,
 Problem addressed: Charging time. This was suggested by a friend, and I thought the idea was great. In theory, you could just roll your car up to a station and just swap your car battery with a full one in an automated process and hit the road again in a matter of seconds. I was surprised that I hadn't heard of it before, but then I found out that it HAS been tried before, just not with a lot of success, and though Tesla ran some tests using their swappable battery stations, they decided to focus on their Superchargers instead. Still, I think that if done well and efficiently, this would at least be an amazing supplementary solution to people who want quicker charging. I didn't want to torture you with another diagram since there's already plenty on the concept anyway: https://goo.gl/dzcAcx

Idea 3: On-the-road chargers,
 Problem Addressed: Charging time. Okay this is by far the craziest idea but I thought it could be fun to think about if we temporarily don't panic about the mass infrastructural reform it would necessitate. The idea is to have conductive strips slightly protruding out of the roads and when you drive your car over them, it would automatically charge your car thanks to a pair of metal rods you'd stick to the back of your car. Literally charging on the go. I was partially inspired by the way bumper cars use a pole connected to an overhead electric grid to power on. Still crazy though, but anyway, here's another sad diagram to illustrate: https://goo.gl/JPVDr9


tldr; Here are three ideas to make charging electric cars a less irritating experience: public chargers that can slide on the wall, swappable batteries, and conductive roads that charge your car on the go.

I got a bachelor of arts in history right out of high school, and didn't like my options. I wandered, and at age 30 I was working for the family business, but the wounds from the financial crash proved fatal, and we finally sold it in 2014. I was 34.

My mental health was shot from that experience, so I told my wife I wanted to go back to school. She was paying for it, so she said community college or nothing. I went in for electronics engineering technology (three year advanced diploma) and graduated near the top of the class. It was stressful, sure, but I loved it. My mental health is back, I have employment options: mission accomplished. I landed my first job with no effort. 

But interacting with some of my profs left me craving more _intellectual depth_. I've really discovered something in STEM, something I didn't discover in high school. My program didn't have any statistics, for example. It scraped the surface of things like control theory. I really enjoyed the math, but it didn't drill deep. 

I feel like I can hardly justify any more school. I'm so old already and I've done so much school. And sure I can learn stuff online, but school puts you in close proximity to really smart people. It pushes you.

This would create a different strain on the material than a staircase test, in which a load is chosen and tested until failure or until a predetermined limit of cycles.

My question is, which product line would be best suited technically and more desirable for getting hired in the space industry, or does it not matter? My current job is as an Engineer 2 working on an actuation system that is on a rocket engine, and I have an opportunity to move to an Engineer 3 position working on gas turbine engines. Are the analysis techniques in gas turbine engines similar to rocket engines? or would a component mounted onto a rocket engine be more suitable?

Also, any advice on courses or certificates outside of work that would make me more desirable?

Thank you! Cheers.

18,"Would this idea for Ocean garbage patch collection, sorting, compacting and transporting work? (Very long and complex question)",1521941289,"Ok, so it would seem that collection is the easy part - we have already seen concepts of vessels that seem quite capable for this job. But then what? The currently proposed solutions all require a large fleet of transport vessels to take the garbage to land for processing - a very slow and fuelburning concept. 
My idea: Purchase a disused offshore oil/gas rig. These are usually towed to land and scrapped when the ressource field dries out, or ressource prices is too low. Strip it down to a basic platform and refit it with conveyor belts, sorting facility, compactor, shredder, smelters, loading facility, anchoring for collector vessels and living quarters.
Tow it to the garbage patch, anchor it just as you would if it was producing oil, helicopter a crew on board. A small fleet of collection vessels can now collect the garbage and feed it to the rig, where it can be manually sorted, shredded, compacted, smelted. 
Now you have a much more compact cargo for the transport vessels, which will save large amounts of time and fuel in transport. 
For power, i imagine a purpose built windmill. During towing, The wings will be mechanically locked and the tower turned in order to lower wind resistance. The tower will also be hydraulically lowered thru the rig's deck, as low as possible, in order to keep the rig stable in high winds during towing. Once the rig is anchored on site, it can easily support the fully erected mill.

21,Going From Management Back To Engineering?,1521932378,"Has anyone here gone from engineering into management and back into engineering?  Best decision ever?  Worst?

I'm a (late 30's/early 40's) first line engineering manager (I directly manage ~20 engineers from several disciplines) of 3-5 years at a big well respected company that you have all heard of.  I really like the work my team does and the products we build.  They really do inspire me, everyone around me, and many people around the world.  The company has been extremely good to me over the years and I have absolutely nothing to complain about in terms of compensation, benefits, etc.  That's all really great.  I like working with, developing, and advocating for my engineers.  And I like getting shit done.  I'm really good at driving execution and efficiency (getting projects done on time and on budget or better), but honestly not that good with (or interested in) formulating strategy and selling it.  I have a ""no bullshit"" attitude that hampers my ability to be diplomatic.

Despite good performance ratings (I actually really like and get along well with my immediate boss), I'm honestly dissatisfied.  I don't believe I really have the right personality type for management.  I abhor the politics and the bureaucracy at my level and up the chain.  Many hours of my week are spent in pointless mandatory management meetings reviewing the same materials over and over and over and over.  I'm often not empowered to make decisions without significant oversight.  Lots of time is wasted on mundane topics and inability of my leaders to actually make decisions and stick to them (feels like decisions are often made in committee and then revisited continually in other committees).  I can feel my soul slowly being sucked out of me.  I have no desire to move up the chain (it's all politics up there).  But, since it's a huge company I might feel differently in a different division.  Though thus far I have been unable (and not for lack of trying) to get a lateral move to another spot.  I have two different B.S. degrees in engineering and an MBA.

I really just like working with numbers and analysis.  Writing code.  Improving tools and processes.  Inventing new ways to interrogate the data.  I've always liked jumping between engineering disciplines and exploring new things.  I get bored pretty easily (2-3 years in one position is usually enough for me).  So I'm very seriously considering going back to engineering.  I wouldn't be the first but I've witnessed the stigma on those who have preceded me.  There is a big part of me that thinks of going back as ""failure"" - like I just couldn't hack it.  I could ride this job for 15-20 more years and have enough to comfortably retire, put my kids through college, etc, etc.  But sometimes I'm super jealous of my engineers.  They present results to me for approval, I provide feedback, I guide them on what they should be looking for, I help them w/ messaging, I look for opportunities to develop them and fill in gaps in their knowledge/experience, and that's awesome.  But I'd rather be doing the engineering work.  I want to be working along side w/ them - not catching up with them in short stints between bullshit meetings that have no measurable purpose.  I could still ""lead from the trenches"" without all the overhead and could probably add more value to the company.

I don't know.  I'm rambling.  Thoughts on going back?  I'd really like to hear from others that have had similar thoughts or have actually done it.  It would help to know the situation, size of company, how it worked out, etc, etc.

22,Can transformer core de-lamination cause transient voltages dips.,1521931917,"I've got an old Tascam 4 track recorder, and I keep getting weird pops and clicks in my recordings. I recorded a 440Hz reference tone into some tape to try and troubleshoot and then played it back into an audio interface running at 192kHz. This https://i.imgur.com/uEXQ4F4.png is what the phenomenon looks like up close.

I'm getting the exact same thing irrespective of the signal chain I take through the unit, either input or output, which leads me to believe that it's a power supply issue. There are some loose laminations in the power supply core that buzz like hell when the unit's on. Is it possible that this osculation is causing a 30kHz-ish voltage dip in the power for the whole unit, or is it more likely a bad cap?

Here's a few other things I've observed: The audio always swings in the negative direction direction, irrespective of whether or not the audio signal is positive or negative. They don't always occur at peaks in the audio signal and the amplitude of the phenomenon is almost always the same, and not proportional to the audio signal level.

24,Safety question re: heating coal tar pitch,1521929786,"My employer just started up a process involving coal tar pitch. I am specifically wondering if there are regulations being violated. Some of the engineers that set this process up are from a country that does not have a great track record for worker safety. (our very experienced EHS person resigned suddenly, so we can't ask that person.)

The process: 
1) coal tar pitch is spray dried with another material
2) the powder from step 1 is heated in large kiln with an inert atmosphere. The kiln is over 600 degrees C, which will volatilize coal tar pitch. This kiln is vented to outside but does not have a baghouse on it. 
3) resulting product is used for something else. During transfer, the product (powder) gets all over the floor of the factory.

The workers are doing the kiln runs at night and are very secretive about everything. After kiln runs, there is a ""solvent smell"" in the air of that section of the factory. Coal tar pitch is a carcinogen, from what I can tell.

Why can't car manufacturers design virtually indestructible pods that can survive the crushing of a bridge, or a semi-truck ramming into it. Is there no physical way a pod can be designed to survive such pressure? 

Maybe it's a cost issue. Wouldn't it be easier to start off making a tiny pod to protect a baby? With a drop down shield over it, like a Delorean car door cover.  Maybe in the future it could be made fire proof, with it's own oxygen supply to withstand 15 minutes of fire, like how the tiles on the shuttle can withstand re-entry.

Maybe a little video can play a video inside the shield so the infant can see videos of mom and dad singing songs. And the padding inside should be upped so it's velvety soft and cushioning. No serious blows or injuries. A better harness system, and one that can prevent whiplash, and secure the babies head.

34,Technical Engineers - How do you feel about the lower salary?,1521896112,"I am an engineer currently working in a power plant in Ontario, Canada. The company is an electric utility and many people would consider it ""winning the lottery"" to work here. Above average pay, 35 hour weeks, unionized, excellent benefits and pension.

I had enjoyed the technical parts of engineering while in school and liked my engineering consulting internship before graduation. Once I graduated, I left due to the higher pay at the utility. However, my current engineering role (and many other jobs in the organization) feel more like paper pushing to get through the bureaucracy. Yet, the new grad pay is $80k (compared to $60k in consulting). Additionally, the job is 35 per week with overtime and very chill compared to consulting.

I would like to be technical, i.e. work in consulting, but cannot justify the lower pay and potentially crazy hours. I think consulting engineers cap around $120k (with unpredictable and long hours) versus $130k (without overtime) at my current company.

I think this is a similar trend across the industry since a senior engineer did tell me to leave the technical work due to pay when I was deciding to leave consulting. How do many of you come to terms with doing boring work for higher pay? If it was a simple 10-15% difference, I might take the technical job. However, the Ontario sunshine list show many engineers making much more than that difference.

We'd like to avoid machining because the software is the main component of the project. Our wheels are these 3'' diameter omni wheels which have square axle-holes with a 3mm diameter circular fitting. Our chassis is 3D-printed PLA. We're looking for something that we can attach to the underside of the chassis which simply allow the two wheels to spin freely.

As i'm writing this, a question came up.. With differential drive (1 motor/wheel on the back wheels, changing direction by adjusting the speed of a single back wheel), can we have the two front wheels on the same axle? Or do they need to be independant?

Any help would be really appreciated as the hardware of this project is eating away at our remaining time!

48,Heat Performance Questions on Heat Exchangers,1521841901,"Hi Everyone,

I have some questions about heat exchangers:

1) Does it make sense for a heat exchanger to have a U value greater than its design value? Is this expected in some practical cases?

2) If the tubes of the exchanger become fouled, is it still possible for the U value to remain constant?  I know the fouling resistance factor will decrease the U value but is it practical for the tubeside convective heat transfer coeffcient to increase to cancel it out?

3) Can fouled tubes decrease the flow through the exchanger? I imagine this is possible in a cooling water system where it can created back pressure and redistribute flow to other equipment. This in turn can decrease the Reynolds number causing a reduction in the convective heat transfer coefficient as well.

4) I'm having hard time understanding the meaning of Prandtl Number. Some sources describe it as the ratio between convective heat transfer versus conduction but isn't that the meaning of Nusselt's number? Does a high Pr mean the fluid can transfer heat more easily than it can contain heat?

5) For shell and Tube Heat Exchangers that are not insulated, what percent of heat loss can we expect from radiation with nearby outside surfaces? Should we not expect the Q (hot side) = Q (tube side)?

My second job involved a whole range of stuff from glass to small electrical kitchen appliances to thermal shipper, etc.  none of which had I had real world experience in before.  

The job I interviewed for most recently involved some sheet metal bending which I haven't done before, but that was just one part of the whole product, and they were concerned that I didn't have that part of the package.  Is this common to expect the new hire to be familiar with everything?

I am always honest in interviews about my level of experience in these topics, but I am wondering if that is backfiring since I know many people exaggerate their competency so perhaps they think that my response is still an exaggeration and that I have no familiarity at all when I say I am not proficient in it.

A little about the lab. We have a sister company located in a third world country. We are a telecom service provider (towers, ISP services, radar, etc.).


We are starting a new program in our company that hires recent graduates from local universities and putting them into an additional classroom environment where instructors continue to lecture the recent grads/new hires with relevant material, theories, etc. 


The second part of this is putting them into a lab environment where they can continue to work on associated electronics and thorough understanding of RF signals.


We have been given a list of equipment already, but they are asking us to do some research and find additional relevant equipment.  Here is a list of things that we already have;

* 60 MHz - 4 Channel, Digital Storage Oscilliscope
* Arbitrary Waveform Function Generators, 40 MHz
* 4 1/2 Digital Multimeter
* Prevision Variable Adjustable, 30V 5A DC Tripple Linear Power Supply
* Spectrum Analyzer, 500 MHz
* Spectrum Analyzer, 3.2 GHz
* Programmable Prevision Variable 30V, 5A DC Linear Power Supply
* Bench Digital Multimeter, 1kV, 10A, 6.5 Digit
* Triple Output 195 Watt Power Supply
* Hot Air Rework Soldering Station
* GPS Disciplined Clock
* DC Electrical Load
* Dual Band VHF tuner, 144MHz, 200MHz
* Resistance Decade Box
* Capacitance Decade Box
* Function Generator, Digital Synthesis DDS, 1 Channel, 3 MHz
* 4 Decade Resistance Box
* Digital Electronic Caliper
* 200 MHz Digital Oscilloscope, 2 Channels


In addition to that, there are various smaller items, should as wire kits, resistor kits, voltage regulators, Mosfet's, multiple cables with connections and adapters, cutters, soldering kits, solder suckers, protoboards, etc..

The real kicker is that we are shipping this equipment to said country and power requirements are different, 220V 50Hz (EU standards).

5) All of this data will go through a ADC (Analogic-Digital Conversor), then to the microcontroller and finally to a LCD display.

Here are some of our questions/comments:

A) Do you guys have any suggestion for us to improve the project?

B) I didn't mention the Conductivity Sensor because we are still trying to figure out a good way to do it, any ideas? 

C) The glass electrode is kinda expensive where we live, are there other ways of measuring the pH?

D) Our professor told us to try to set the temperature and controll it, but we don't actually know how to do the cooling, if necessary.

85,Finding a job similar to deck building in a card game.,1521758138,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in a rotation program at work, been an engineer in the defense industry for two and half years now, but my past roles haven’t entirely excited me (data entry/coding, mechanical design) I thought I’d ask the community if there are engineering roles out there that align with my hobbies and passions, namely the joy I get from deckbuilding. 

When I deck build I love the aspect of looking at a meta, finding a way to beat or subvert the popular strategies out there, then examining the available cards in the set, and subsequently testing and refining it to perfection. 

Does anyone have a job similar to this, or have an idea of what sort of path to pursue towards a position such as this?",AskEngineers,time_2_live,/r/AskEngineers/comments/86frde/finding_a_job_similar_to_deck_building_in_a_card/

87,EE/Hardware question involving an audio chip,1521752650,"tl;dr is at the bottom

Hi everyone. I'm currently trying to sort out an issue I'm having with a Blue brand USB microphone. This is the basic problem: when you try to plug more than one Blue Yeti mic into a computer, the computer can't differentiate between the two. Because of this, you can't run 2 mics for something like a podcast into the same computer and get two distinct audio tracks. (real quick: I know there are other solutions like getting a USB mixer and some XLR mics. I've already invested in this HW and would like to solve this).

Here's where I'm at: I've determined that you can send the mic back to Blue and they will change the serial number that's flashed on the chip. Upon opening the mic, it seems like the entire thing is run by a C-Media CM6400 audio chipset. Blue's internal naming for the board is ""Rev8c"" and the serial number on the 3 different mics I've plugged in read ""REV8"". In another reddit post, it looks like when Blue gets is back, they change the serial to something arbitrary (in the case I found, they made it ""777""). I'm not afraid to get my hands a little dirty here, or try things that might fry the mic. I just really would like to get in the weeds on how it might be possible to change the serial number on this audio chipset. I've found the datasheet from C-Media and that's about it. I figure that since it's not a proprietary audio chip that there might be a way to flash it. I'm really, really trying to avoid sending it back to Blue and they are extremely tight-lipped about the whole thing. Any ideas?

tl;dr - I want to flash the off-the-shelf audio chipset in my USB mic to have a different serial number.

I need to analyse the heat loss of the diesel engine of a vehicle under maximum performance. Specifically, the vehicle is the Hino 500 Series GH 1835 Manual and the engine is the Hino A09C, which has a maximum power output of 257kW at 1800RPM. If you would like, a datasheet can be found here: http://www.hino.com.au/uploads/pdf/specification/hsmy17gh1832gh1835-0217_web_(2).pdf. From my calculations, I am getting a heat loss from the engine of -2815kW, but this feels way too high. Could someone please give me a typical value for the heat loss of a diesel engine so that I can see if I'm far off? I was expecting a value around 800kW - is that still far off?

Above is the link to the I'm sure of the tower next to a meterstick

     Our main problems revolve around getting a base that spans a 30cm diameter circle and rises to a height of 20cm. The total tower (base and chimney) has to be something minimum of 60 centimeters tall) Our current tower has a mass of 10 grams and our goal is sub 5 grams. At sub 5 grams it only needs to be able to hold 3kg. Our problem is that we don't know whether to use a tower that is triangular like this one or square. Another is our support structure. We don't know that the most efficient support structure is and we don't know what we need to do to that out. For example, in the chimney of our tower, we are debating the use of X supports instead of the current oil Derrick design. We are also debating the use of a 3 leg base (less weight) or a 4 leg base (more strength)
     The tower itself is made up of 1/16 inch balsa wood. In the uprights and base supports it is doubled up. Our adhesive is super glue with accelerator. Here is a gif of the tower with force applied https://giphy.com/gifs/mz8ljESsWs1xOLrjFD.X

93,[Civil] Does this energy storage system seem buildable?,1521743090,"[This](https://heindl-energy.com/technical-concept/basic-concept/) is a giant rock piston in a giant hole in the ground with some hydraulics; pump water in the bottom to store energy, let water out through turbines to release energy. It's sort of a giant plug carved out of the ground and lifted and lowered. 

The energy stored goes with R^4 (for stability, the piston height is some multiple of the radius so M goes with R^3 , and you can raise the piston to some multiple of its own height, so mgh goes with R^4 .) I believe that. 

The claim is that the costs go with R^2 and so you can make this cost-effective if you just make it big enough. Like ""200 meter radius"" kind of big enough.

I'm a recent BEng Electronics grad - finished every year with first, and of course graduated with a first overall (previous experience working in a semi-skilled electronics repair shop) - I've been in my current job for almost 12 months (I was 'head hunted' during my final year) where I have work on audio related projects doing DSP (algorithm dev, low level assembly exp, C and C++, knowledge of instruction set architectures) and Digital hardware (FPGA, high speed circuit design (schem-&gt;PCB-&gt;debug) ect). My current salary is 28.5k (which I'm expecting to increase to 30k by the end of this year).

I decided some time ago that the job isn't exactly what I want (due to location, and contractual obligations that stop me from starting my own business on the side) but decided to stick around to the 2 year mark, to get some proper experience under my belt - as well as savings in the bank! 

I've come to the conclusion that once I have worked my 2 years, I will be looking to move to a Digital hardware role with salary expectations of between 35k - 40k (with 35k min). However, upon discussing this with a couple of fellow engineers I've been told that my salary expectations are unrealistic - which in all honesty, I was pretty shocked to hear.. my gut tells me that the people making that statement, are undervalued themselves.

28,"What is a ""true"" engineering discipline?",1521686742,"Good day,

I am currently a first-year student going to my second year. By the end of the year, we have to submit a form deciding on 10 programs we would like to pursue, with #1 being our top priority.

My problem is that I currently want to choose the discipline Computer Engineering - Software Option, but my dad (an electrical engineer) states that I should pick something else as a ""Computer Engineer - Software Option"" isn't really a engineer, but rather just someone who Computer Science. When my dad (who is pretty old now), took his bachelor's of engineering, they only had civil, mechanical, chemical, and electrical. Therefore, he believes that this are the only discipline considered as ""true"" engineers. I was just wondering if this was true, and whether I should just edit my priorities? I was also wondering what is the difference between someone with a computer science degree and a computer engineer with a specialization in software (because the more I think about it, the more I believe my dad)? Should I just remove the Computer-Software to just Computer?

My List is currently:

* Computer-Software
* Computer

* Civil

* Electrical

Despite all sorts of strange advertising There is only one basic technology for an electric hotplate that I have seen mass produced. An induction heating of iron.

They should all be basically the same price because they all do the same thing and im getting tired of having to guess who fucked up and who actually built it right. The only real variation is if there is a decent temperature measure onboard and if it is programed to accurately turn off and on to maintain some temperature. So which one does the job?

32,Have I chosen the wrong Eng. Course?,1521674051,"TL; DR: I'm thinking about transferring from Automation to Physics Eng. because I'm not eager thinking about what I would work wit, if I achieved this course. However switching would cost me a year (I would have to start the first year again). What would you tell me?

Hi there, I'm going through my first year in University this year. I've enrolled in Automation Engineering in Italy (here we have 3 years Bachelor and 2 years Major, I'm attending the first one). Even though I don't dislike the subjects, I'm afraid I may have chosen the wrong path. I think I may have chosen it because it's ""future applications"". I've had a big crisis period where I didn't know if I did wrong choosing engineerig. After a couple of weeks of despair I've realised tha I want to be an engineer at every cost. Anyways now I'm thinking I may have chose the wrong engineering: I have thought about Mechanical or even Civil as substitutes because the first one is very ""wide"" and the second one ""somethinf different"". After some thoughts I've evaluated Civil wouldn't do for me and that Mechanical may have the same appeal as Automation. The day I selected my course on the online form I had some uncertainties whether I should take Automation or Physics  Engineering. Now I started reconsidering Physics again: I like the subject, radiation has always fascinated me as well. They are obviously no solid reasons but I'm afraid that this thought could be just ephemere as the other two. I realised that I'm not particularlu entusiast about Automation job's possibilities: working with robots, industrial robots, self driving cars, intelligent refrigerators etc. Yes, they're cool stuff, but I wouldn't have new ideas or eagerness to deal with all that. Transfering to Physics Eng. is possible but it will probably require me to start over (something I wouldn't really dislike because of different things that prevented me from expressing my true potential) from the first year (as if I ""lost"" one) What could you tell me?",AskEngineers,suzepo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/866urm/have_i_chosen_the_wrong_eng_course/

43,Deciding between 2 universities (4 vs 5 year courses),1521650268,"I'm in Western Australia and trying to decide between Curtin University and the University of Western Australia (UWA) for mechanical engineering. 

The Curtin program is just 4 years of straight engineering with an honours component (major final year project). No broadening units and non-engineering electives.

UWA on the other hand is 5 years, with the first 3 being a BSc (Engineering Science) which leads into a Master of Professional Engineering in the final 2 years. As I understand it if you leave after the first 3 years (or don't achieve the 65% course average necessary to make it into the masters) you're basically stuck, because the 3 year program isn't accredited. You would have to transfer to another uni and would be placed in 2nd or 3rd year. The first 3 years also has a bunch of broadening units and electives (from any school). You can also double major with pretty much anything else, where at Curtin you can't.

From what I've heard, in the state the 2 courses are basically seen as equal by employers. However I would like to work overseas and UWA is better recognised both interstate (it's one of the Group of Eight unis) and overseas. In terms of international rankings, UWA is 93 and Curtin is somewhere in the 260's.

The actual content between the two is almost the same, just UWA is stretched out more to fit in some broadening units, but at the end you get a ""masters"" out of it.

It works about 90% of the time, but the other 10% leaves paint on top of the flat edge of the zerk.

53,Mechanical vs. Software Engineering,1521620958,"Hello, 
I am an American high school senior, and I was fortunate enough to be admitted into several great university programs for both mechanical engineering and computer science. I am interested in both majors, but I am extremely unsure about what path I want to take.
On one hand, the immediate job/wage prospects for software engineering seem to be extremely good right now. In addition, software seems to have the most unanimous relevance in the modern tech world, meaning that there are many possible career paths for software. And in my school, CS is known to be for the ""cool kids who are going to get the big bucks"". The question is, how long will the tendency for software engineers to make extremely high wages last? I understand that software engineers will probably be needed for a very long time, but will the career stay as ""in vogue"" and high paid as it is now in say, the next one to three decades? 
On the other hand, I've heard that mechanical engineering can be a more stable major to pursue; it won't be affected as much by the fluctuations of industry trend. In addition, I am very interested in physical engineering, engineering that exists physically rather than just in abstract code. But at the same time, I've heard from some that ME is the ""mental ditch digging"" of engineering, and that many ME's end up working on very menial, repetitive projects, and that it is near impossible to get a higher level job without some sort of graduate degree. 

Above all, (perhaps this thinking is naïve) I would like to do something ""meaningful"" with my degree, more than just money/job security, whether that means working with the latest technology or building something that can have an impact on the world.

Please, if you can answer, any answer would help a lot. I feel this will be a very pivotal decision for me, and I need many different perspectives. And feel free to correct me on any assumptions I may have gotten wrong.

59,Need Help for an Interesting Design I'm Building,1521592116,"I've been thinking about it for months, and finally ended up asking to build it, and surprisingly got permission. I've asked a friend for help, but this sub seems to be the place I should ask for help. I'm making what can be described only as a freeze gun. Like a flamethrower, in reverse. 

Basically, I want to have a liquid Nitrogen tank hooked up to a basic PVC tube used as a gun barrel, with a trigger mechanism I haven't yet figured out. I also want a water tank hooked up to it, further down the barrel, so that the water doesn't freeze near the butt of the gun. I do not want a liquid Nitrogen explosion. The whole thing would work on a system of, as near as I can figure, 8 [number under question] CO2 canisters, which would propel the substances forward. The water should hopefully be freezing as it travels, similarly to the ""freezing rain"" phenomenon, only the object doesn't have to be cold. I've linked a rudimentary sketch of the idea below.

So these are my questions: How do I control simultaneity of CO2 release? Should I use fewer canisters? How do I get the trigger to actually fire properly (also, where to get said trigger?) Will PVC freeze and crack after continual exposure to N2? What kind of rubber/plastic tubing will effectifely contain and pump the N2 to the gun? Will the air leaving the gun create enough of a pressure drop to siphon the water from the tank? (And if not, how to get that to the gun?)

Problem is, I need around a dozen or more of these movements, and I sure don't want to drop $40+ for a linear actuator for each one. Additionally, these will be used in a very quiet environment, so the quieter the better (ideally 15 dB or below). On the plus side, it really doesn't have to push much around - maybe a couple pounds (&lt;5, for sure) tops.

So: 8"" movement, max. Preferable 15 dB, max, 5lbs max push, and as low-priced as possible.

71,A question for all control engineers,1521571381,"I want to adjust the very poor cooling temperature regulation of one of our engines. The setup looks like this:
The engine is a 1.300 kW gas engine which is powered by mine gas. The cooling water flows from the engine to a table top cooler, which contains cooling fans. The frequency of the cooling fans is the correcting variable of my system. The pump runs with a constant speed. The cooling water temperature on the entrance of the engine is measured and should be kept on the same level all the time.

The enginecontrol has a PID Controller, which I want to optimize.

From university I know that I need the step function and the step response. And there I have the problem. How can I do this? What is the step function for my setup? How can I do it in practice?

I bought a house (raised ranch, built in 1988) and decided to renovated the kitchen.  After stripping 7 layers of vinyl and laminate flooring, I came across the subfloor, which appears to be 1 1/4 inches of plywood (1/2 inch over 3/4, laid perpendicular).

I’m wondering essentially if 1/4 inch of cement board, thunder, and 3/8 inch ceramic tile will destroy my house.  Joists are 2x10, 16 OC, spanning 12 feet.  The joists and subfloor are absent of sag from the previous floor for the record.

If required, I could rip up the subfloor (the sheets are glued together) but that would also require pulling out the cabinets and appliances.  

Lastly, I understand this is probably a fucking stupid question.  Usually I am the one fielding them so I appreciate your time and patience.  I’ve called a structural engineer to come by next week but in the meantime I’d like to see what’s the consensus.

I have great grades, can manage my studies well while juggling a long-term relationship, and can also fit time for a healthy social life. The drawback is...I have an anxiety issue that seems to be getting worse over the last two years from the build up of school stress.

I've dealt with anxiety since I was young but it has recently been getting worse and harder to deal with on my own so I'm reaching out for advice from others who share my struggles. I'm usually pretty good at swallowing the anxiety and powering through to get what needs to get done-done. But this recent trigger has been very different and left me feeling vulnerable and helpless. To spare you some drawn out details, the main problem is about a month ago I spent a weekend working on a lab report (about 20-22 hours over the span of two days) and I believe the stress from that threw me into the storm I'm still riding out a bit. 

It started with a very traumatic anxiety attack the night after my group and I turned in the report around 2:00 am when I couldn't sleep because all I saw when I closed my eyes were numbers and spreadsheets...The anxiety kept coming back over the coming days so intensely and robbing me of my sleep that I emailed my professors id be taking the week off to go ride it out with my parents. The worst of it is over, I'm definitely in the recovery phase (now 4 weeks later) but theres a big problem. I'm too afraid to put myself in even minor stressful situations because I don't want a repeat of what happened. It's a mental hurdle I'm really struggling with, because now we have another report (with a presentation this time) due this coming Monday and the anxiety is creeping back up whenever I think about it.

This is very unlike me to be afraid of stressful things like this and it worries me that we still have two more reports to do (not to mention my studies for my other classes this semester) and I was wondering if anyone has similar experiences and can share what they did to deal with the stressors holding them back. The fact of the matter is, the stressor won't go away and I MUST deal with it head on but I feel I lack the tools to get over this hurdle right now.

Hi ~~/r/plastic~~ /r/AskEngineers  I homebrew beer, and I also have a lot of 17L PC plastic bottles. The general consensus amongst homebrewers is that #1 and #2 are safe, but #7 might be kind of dodgy. That being said, there doesn't seem to be a lot of science behind this conventional reasoning. From my (limited) understanding, there is evidence to suggest that PC plastic is not safe in food products when exposed to heat, but I don't really know what kind of heat we're talking about? Also, it'd be exposed for an extremely short period of time.

Typically you'd be looking at, maximum, 80 degrees celcius for up to an hour or two. But depending on how you decide to go about it, this could be reduced to between 20 and 30 degrees, the closer to 20 the better. It would then sit at between 18 and 26 degrees for several weeks.

We have not been receiving water reliably for years and frequently see incoming pressures that are too low to get past the double check valve. What I want to be able to do is determine the required pressure and flow required to deliver water to a number of houses. Some of the facts I know are:

-2 gpm restrictor per household x 36 households

-Highest point in the system is 120 feet, the lowest point (0) is the start of the system and the point I am solving for.

-Must maintain 14psi at all points in the system

Am I right in thinking that 120' = 52psi pressure drop, so a pressure of 66psi and a flow of 72gpm would be required to maintain 14psi at all locations? I am aware this makes no adjustments for pipe losses, but I don't think I require that much detail at this time.

Alternately, if the supply is 70psi (guess) and 20gpm (confirmed flow), what size would the restrictors need to be for the system to function properly? More importantly, what would the effects be if a number of restrictors were oversized?

29,Help choosing a major,1521465327,"Sometimes I lurk so much I forget I can actually post a question. I’m a first year college student, (23 y/o) majoring in computer science at my local community college; however, I have been taking mainly gen ed classes so far, aside from Com Sci 100 (which is still a prerequisite for a number of other majors as well). Therefore, I can still choose a different major right now and wouldn’t have to backtrack and take any extra classes for any degree I choose. I have a 3.88 Overall GPA, which I’ve been told is good. I chose Com Sci as my major because I want to learn to code, but really I like science in general and am not TRULY committed to com sci, meaning I could stay with it or switch and I wouldn’t be any less or more happy.

Recently, I went to a STEM seminar at my school and the head of the Math and Physics Dept., this young, handsome doctor type, was giving a speech about the different paths for different major types. He said he would urge people to go after an AAS (associate of applied science) vs an AS (associate of science) because the you’ll be more prepared to go into the workforce upon graduation, the caveat being that an AAS doesn’t help you transfer to a four-year school as well as an AS. He also said that he thinks a com sci degree is more for someone who doesn’t know what concentration they want to go into but still wants to be in school. He didn’t say it directly to me, but, com sci being my major, it definitely resonated with me.

So I guess my question is this: has anyone gone through this period of wondering if they’re in the right major? I know I want to be in STEM but I don’t want to choose the wrong thing and screw up my life, as I’m already starting college pretty late. I want to make money out of college but I also don’t want to give up on getting a PhD so early. Is there a middle ground? I know I may be asking a lot as know one will know what I truly like better than me, but job an education wise, what is the best route right now in general? BS and then get out of there? Maybe not even that much? Please tell me your thoughts. The doctor at my school is telling me to not go after a PhD because they don’t even make that much money and that I should go for an AAS in Cybersecurity or Electrical Engineering, as I like computers like I said before.

61,Is my Invention idea feasible?,1521384124,"I wasn't sure where to post so apologies if this is inappropriate.  Also my technical knowledge of  electronics or any related fields is approaching zero. 
So basically I was wondering if it would be possible to have a table felt/underlay that could detect the denomination and number of casino chips sitting on it, and their approximate position. I thought if the entire table had a very low charge running through it in various small circuits (either open or closed), and the chips act like resistors, as in a $5 chip has a resistance of 5 ohms (not sure what the unit of measurement is?), 2 $5 chips stacked would have resistance of 10 ohms, $25 chip has resistance of 25 ohms, etc.  
I think you get the idea of what I'm trying to do, just looking for some advice from someone who knows about how you would go about making such a thing, if possible, or if anyone could think of an easier/better method to achieve the same results (I was considering small magnetic fields, but thought that would be harder).

Driving behaviors like how hard you brake or corner should affect tire life, right?  Maybe even how many passengers are sitting in a vehicle.  Presumably a van filled with 7 adults should put more downward force on a tire causing the tread to wear out faster than a car with just one driver?

74,Absorbing magnetic fields (saturation point of mild steel),1521346527,"Hi AE,

I am not sure whether anyone here would be able to help me but I have hit a bit of a wall and would love it if someone could point me in the right direction.

I am currently working on a project where we have been asked by the client to shield a transformer room from any magnetic fields coming into the main tenancy. The room is 4m x 4m x 4m facing the street with masonry walls and a steel door. We have had the magnetic field strength tested on the outside of this room, the strongest recorded area being 18 mG (Milligauss).

Most of the information I have found online seem to take that you can absorb the magnetic field with any ferrous metals, increasing the thickness of the metal until you reach the “saturation point” so I assume we would want to be lining the walls with material thicker than the required saturation point. Is my thinking correct?

We have been looking at using mild steel sheets though hours of searching the net I have not been able to find any information to help me find the thickness required to meet the saturation point (or whether this option is even feasible).

Would anyone know the thickness to reach the saturation point for mild steel sheet metal to absorb 18 mG? Would the room need to be lined in a way that any gaps are sealed with ferrous material or would the magnetic flux be attracted to the steel? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hey, as the title says, I’m a first year second semester mech eng student unsure if this is the field I want to go into. 

Ever since I had my very first intro. to programming class in c++, I found coding to be very fun. The design and drawing classes I’ve taken for MECH have really put me off and I don’t think I have much interest in designing. The math and physics is fun and interesting, but I’ve only been exposed to design career paths offered in mech and I don’t know if that’s what I truly want to do. I’ve heard everywhere that mech is a broad field and very secure, but I’ve only ever seen jobs revolving around manufacturing/CAD. Also, I’ve been told there is so many mech eng students it’s harder to find a job. Now since I loved my coding class, I’ve had a great interest in software engineering, but I have a couple worries.

One is that since I’ve done so much of math and physics growing up, I’m accustomed to self teaching myself; however, in software I would not have the same foundation and I fear I would have much more difficulty trying to learn newer material. Also at my current uni, I have heard on many occassions the comp sci/software eng departments have worse teachers. I hear often that this major offers a load of jobs and great pay, but I’m not sure if I should finalize the switch. I always think to myself: can’t I learn to code and just go into a programming job as mech? I’m not even sure if thats possible. I’m afraid of making a switch into a more limited career from something as more broad as mech. The mech program is reputable at my school, especially since I am in co op and have an internship next fall. 

I’ve been really struggling in making a decision on whether I should make a switch from a major I’m not completely aware of what it can offer, to a major that seems exciting, well payed, fun, but waaaay out of my element and a mystery as to what I’d learn, etc.  I was hoping if someone could give me some insight on what mech could offer, if it can go in line with more programming and not completely design/manufacturing, and just any information that would help me make a decision! Would anyone be able to give me information on what one learns in software and how jobs are? And how jobs are in mech? 

tl;dr: a
Are there plenty of job paths in mech eng that aren’t just mainly based on designing/CAD or manufacturing? I worry that switching from a secure field to mech eng into software which is more limited may be a mistake, especially since mech eng is more reputable at my school and secure. I am very familiar with maths and physics, and switching is way out of my element, I’m really not sure if I should do it. Would anyone be able to give me information on what one learns in software and how jobs are? And how jobs are in mech?

Cheers. 

Ok, so here is the formula, it is called the hoblit buckling formula, i am trying to use it to find the buckling load of a hollow stepped column. it is for a telescopic cylinder application, right now we are using euler's/pc johnson but that is really only giving you a lower value because it is taking it as one slender rod, with no support from the stages

the problem i am having is, the formula in the spread sheet i am converting from is quattro-pro and i am converting it to excel, we never used the hoblit page as we could not really understand it enough and the quy who wrote it is long since retired. the formula says to enter the buckling load why you are entering the bearing length and sizes. so you are entering what you are trying to find, and that is where it is stumping us.

the only formula we have been able to find is this on https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/8.1871?journalCode=jans and to be honest it is out of our range of knowledge and out of the range of the information that our customers would provide.

so end result is i am trying to find a stepped column formula that is both simple to understand and also requiring just the information that we can provide from the design aspect of the cylinder (bore/rod/stroke/tensile of material ans such). hopefully i can put it in to a spread sheet that would allow me  to have multiple steps to simulate a 2 to 6 stage cylinder.

18,Old employer reached out asking if I was interested in coming back (for a different position)...what factors should I consider and does anyone have any advice on whether or not I should do it?,1521213609,"I'm going to try to keep this a bit vague so as to avoid recognition, but here it goes:

An employer that I had an internship with a few years ago reached out today and asked if I would be interested in coming back to the company for a different position (which is more in line with how my career has gone since I left there). I currently work as an automation engineer for a consulting firm and receive (what I consider to be) a very good salary for someone with only 2 years experience in automation. (I think this is in part due to the size of the firm and the fact that much of their business is in a heavily regulated industry, though I don't really care to work in this industry.)

The company I once interned with asked me if I'd be interested in rejoining them as an automation engineer (which is not what I interned as). Now, I loved absolutely everything about my time at that company and often think of going back. I am a bit unsure of how to proceed though for a couple of factors including:

1. My old company is very small and I am concerned about their ability to improve upon (or even match) my current salary.
2. My old company has had layoffs in the past while my current company has not, so I may be a losing a touch of job security.
3. I really like my current company and my coworkers, even if I'm not at all fond of the field my clients are in.
4. I'm not sure how it would look on my resume to have the same company twice separated by another company for a relatively brief period (~2 years).
5. I've never left a job before (except at the end of an internship) and really have no idea how to approach leaving my current one.

On the other hand:

1. Working as a consultant at an engineering firm, my pay is very good but I have what I gather to be mediocre benefits. Especially vacation...I would have to stay on at my current company 7 years to get a third week of vacation.
2. I really, really, really enjoyed working for my old company and in theory would love to go back.
3. My old company is in an industry I'm genuinely interested in and probably has some very cool/challenging projects for me to work on.

25,I hate my internship and I could really use some advice.,1521188213,"I hate my internship. I work at a small local aerospace company as a Mechanical Engineering intern. I am completing my third year of a BSME and I have been working as an intern for this company for 10 months. Generally, I get a very large workload as I complete all of the company's design and drafting work as well as their engineering documents (SSAs, PMAs, PSCPs, QTPs... etc). Along with that, I am given constant daily tasks that often take precedent over many of my other assigned tasks.

I am often unable to complete projects because I am given so many at once and between this 24-30hr workweek in addition to taking Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Machine design and FEA, I feel immensely overworked at times. The company I work at is owned and run by 4 engineers and 3 of the 4 can be complete assholes at times and it makes it a very toxic place to be a part of. Because I am given so much engineering work, I have had to learn so much at a very quick rate but I am often yelled at for making minor mistakes although I am learning. There is a language barrier with my boss, and he often underestimates the time it will take for me to complete his tasks. There is an absolute disconnect and I have tried to resolve it, but he is old school and doesn't give a shit. I feel I have learned a great deal, but its not necessarily what I would like to do as a career. I would rather work in components design or Aero Thermal Fluids/ Propulsion and I don't get to touch any of that here.

As stated, I have been here about 10 months now and I would really like to quit, but I don't want to look like I can't manage school and work together to potential employers. Furthermore, I don't have any other internships lined up, but I am just generally pretty unhappy where I am at. I feel like I am learning, but my boss feels like I should be going home and learning on my own time and that if I need to take the time to understand things then I should clock out to learn and then clock back in. Often times, I also feel as though I am unable to ask questions.

I don't get paid much ($15/hr) and I am the only intern. I haven't signed any Co-Op agreement stating I would be there for a certain length of time but the position is available to me until graduation in May of 2019 (granted I do ok).

**The pros** (if you were wondering whether there were any):

* It is close to my school and house

* I feel like I am learning, whether or not that will prove useful to my career pursuits in other facets of engineering is yet to be seen

* I like the technicians and shop floor, and one of the engineers is pretty cool

* I get to solve engineering problems daily!

**The cons**

* Boss is a dick

* Engineers can be dicks

* It's a toxic work environment at times between the bosses and shop floor

* Often given too much work and not enough time to complete tasks

* I don't have a ""mentor"" or anybody I can go to for questions

* I often get chewed out/insulted for being ""too slow"" (I'm not lazy and I'm really trying!)

* I am pretty overworked between school and work, and it seems like cutting my work hours is not an option

**Is this what the industry is like?** I completely understand it may be common to work under pressure to meet deadlines and that the work will be challenging, but is everyone an asshole? This is my first internship so it is my first exposure to the engineering field.
I am a pretty decent student with a 3.4 GPA cumulative and a 3.67 GPA major, but I feel like this internship may take a toll on my grades this semester (I believe I'll pass with a few B's and a C).

Overall, do you think quitting without another internship lined up (I've been trying and interviewing) would be a bad idea? My professor told me that it may look like I couldn't manage my time well enough between school and my internship to future employers.

Also, I should mention, I don't think I would work my senior year anyway because of the massive courseload between senior design and my classes.

26,"slicing, cutting, and shearing forces of inclined blade through metal rod",1521187372,"Hi everyone!

I'm a bit stuck on trying to calculate the forces to shear through a metal rod of circular cross section with an inclined blade (kind of like a guillotine). I understand that a blade with an incline with a slicing movement will reduce the required force to shear, but I've no idea how to calculate that force.

I've looked through a bunch of academic journals dealing with inclined blades but most just use a rectangular cross section, and to calculate the shear force, they use the area under the inclined blade as the area to shear, which makes sense.  

Known information:

Rod diameter = 20 mm 

UTS = 726 MPa

Shear force = 171000 N
(my own calculation, shear force = (3/4)* UTS * A no incline, the 3/4 is the constant for a circular cross section, with max. shear stress occurring in the center of the circular cross section)

UTS = Ultimate Tensile Stress

A = area = pi*radius^2",AskEngineers,nzeng92,/r/AskEngineers/comments/84ttqh/slicing_cutting_and_shearing_forces_of_inclined/

31,Question on Chemical Engineering expectations,1521179482,"Hello, I'm currently about done with all of my gen eds for A.S, in school, but I have yet to take my science core courses and Calc. I originally had a passion for chemistry and looked into pre-pharm, on top of an interest with drugs and interactions. Later on, I just wanted to stick with a core ""chem"" major, because of the sole liking for chemistry. 

Looking into chemistry related jobs on the internet, Chem Eng seemed to be a very good choice. Versatile, reliable degree (in regards to other chemistry jobs), good pay and needing only a 4 year degree, for entry level work. 

What I realized, is that chem engineering, has little to do with actual chemistry. Including the fact that it's mainly rely's on physics and math rather than chem, as I've heard. I do not have complete issue with this, because when it comes down to ""chemistry jobs"" that are used with a chem degree, and not an engineering one; the options are quite limited to- either acquiring a doctorate for Biochemistry, or being a Pharmacist which is not my ideal choice anymore. 

I know there are other chemistry jobs, but it seems like those are not even as stable or what I'd really want to pursue,  knowingly going into something where I would be doing trivial tasks until I acquired a doctorate.

I'm 24, figured out recently, I like math and can actually learn it, after all these years. I've just scraped the surface so far, with just beginning pre-calc, A level work, but who knows how I will handle it all later on. My question to the engineers is the following; 

For several years I had aspiration to study a science. I narrowed things down and was left with chemistry. Comp Sci bores me quite a bit, although I play a lot of video games. Now, knowing that chem eng is going to involve machinery, industrial aspects and sort of a kind of a more concrete arithmetic, rather than an analytic one;

Maybe I worded that poorly to get my point across. What I'm trying to say, is that while I'm fine with learning science and analyzing things, I was always quite the opposite of what you'd call a ""handy man."" 

Things like assembling a table with screws/bolts, fixing appliances like windows, etc- general stuff like that, never clicked with me. I could probably sit down for hours, and look at the manual on how to assemble a TV stand, but I won't enjoy it and it'd be quite cumbersome for me. The sound and intro to Thermodynamics and fluid dynamics are definitely not boring to me, but imagining myself running machinery to produce chemicals..I feel like I'd probably be stupid one day and accidentally blow something up, ""Oops."" Like good going... I feel it's a job for the handy, sharp ""knows what to do on the go"" type of guy. I have legitimate OCD and ask so many questions to verify what I'm doing is correct. Teachers think I'm stupid like ""what do you think?"" , ""Sorry, was just making sure.""

With the notion of engineering now accentuated in my head, I cannot help but question if I am even cut out for something like this. Despite chem E not using chemistry, I find it cool to produce soap products, etc. or to find ways to be eco and economically friendly- just as examples. But, when I'm the type of person who'd screw something up and let my dad handle any trivial task in and out of the house (broken window, car problems, etc.) and having the absence to have a natural approach towards machinery; I really have to ask, am I cut out for this?
 I feel like my ideal options are very limited at this point and I need to make a decision by the fall.

Please let me know what you all think, regardless of what type of engineer or engineering student you are. I also heard Chem E is extremely hard.

39,Heat transfer help,1521154374,"Hey guys I'm mainly a structural engineer, but I'm trying to get my feet wet with some mechanical type work. I'm stumbling through some thermal models and hoping for some insight

I'm looking at a curtain wall parapet. Consider this section view here: https://imgur.com/a/L5hxP

My goal is to determine the surface temperature of the top of the curtain wall mullion. Pretend it is winter, so about 0°F outside. Interior would be about 70°F. In this case, heated interior air reaches the curtain wall mullion below the interior ceiling finish. The only heat that really gets to the top of the mullion would be what is conducted up vertically through the mullion.

Industry standard is to use 2D software (THERM) for modelling. Unfortunately, THERM doesn't  lend itself well to analyzing this heat transfer. I've provided a simplified analysis here: https://imgur.com/a/uxY8s

I can use THERM to estimate the temperature of the mullion exposed to the air. But is there a hand calc I can do to estimate the temperature at the top assuming a steady-state has been reach?

42,Career path from Computer Science to Electrical Engineering,1521152869,"Hello guys. Just a little context: I'm working towards concluding my bachelor's in Computer Science after having already switched from Mechanical Engineering. I was midway through my MechE degree and then decided that I prefer programming computers and understanding how they work rather than designing mechanical systems.

So far, so good. But as I get closer to graduating in CS, I've decided that I don't want to work in typical web development stuff. What interests me the most are the lower level elements of computer science (computer architecture, operating systems, compilers...). Also, I enjoy playing around with microcontrollers and creating simple electronics projects on a breadboard. I have a pretty good background in math and physics too (from all the required classes that I took during my MechE degree)

With that in mind, I thought about trying to get into a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering (with a focus on Computer Engineering). And I would like to work in a company like NVIDIA as a computer architect or writing drivers for GPUs (I want to work close to the hardware).

Is that a feasible path for someone with my background? Most people working so close to the hardware are electrical engineers, so I wonder if my CS background will be an hidrance.

54,Where is the point of diminishing returns where increasing the area of a coil causes a *decrease* in inductance?,1521097867,"When discussing the inductance of a coil, generally speaking, a larger cross-sectional area (of the loop, not the conductor) results in a larger inductance, as the magnetic field flux can form more easily.

However, I would imagine that there must be a point of diminishing returns, given that field strength declines with distance from the conductor.  Ordinarily, each turn generates a magnetic field that reinforces and adds to the field generated by all the other turns.  However, if you imagine a coil with a 1 mile diameter, surely there must be no field strength left by the time you reach the center of the coil.

So what is this limit?  Is there an equation, rule of thumb, or plot that tells you where an increase in area no longer provides a linear response in inductance, and where that point of diminishing returns is where increasing the area further causes a *decrease* in inductance?

To make a long story short, I graduated with a BA degree in 2007. While taking art classes, I worked on campus doing tech support, then later turned into web development. I've been hooked on programming since. I've been able to picked up several contract web development jobs since graduating.

That came to a screeching halt in early 2015.

After being turned down repeatedly for jobs due to a lack of relevant knowledge and my previous experience being snubbed, I'm choosing to go back for an education. My colleagues and Facebook friends haven't given me good job leads. I lack the ability to introspect on my interview performance. I have been poor for a few years, and I'm not motivated to make new friends anymore.

I'm hoping to be as successful as possible, but having been out of school for so long and in a more difficult position (I need a stable full-time job, I have a weak support network) I have no idea where to begin.

Since I already have programming experience, majoring in Comp Sci. may be a bit too redundant and on-the-nose, so perhaps a EE or CE major with CS minor is a possibility. I have a related interest in low-level programming and would love to eventually get into a job at a large semiconductor firm, or otherwise working on embedded software for a company with a vision I really like.

But I need advice on things like managing your time, studying, what jobs to work at, networking, etc. At this point I'll even take inspirational or tales of caution, every bit helps.

A little about me:  I came out of grad school swinging for the fences.  I got my first job at a small, very well funded company.  I quickly distinguished myself and was giving the latitude to build and run development activities as I wanted.  3 years later I had a dozen engineers working for me, my name on a dozen patents, and a huge amount of accomplishments.  I chose to move on from that position because the owners shifted from ambition to stagnation as soon as we had something good.  They wanted to milk what had been done instead of continuing to push boundaries.  Which is understandable, but not what I like to do.

In applying for new jobs, I only had successful interviews with the cutting edge ambitious entities.  Blue Origin, Space X, some other high-tech startups, etc., and ended up taking a job that I was told would give me the latitude to continue pushing boundaries.  The problem is I got diverted into a program with the specific mandate to avoid innovation because it makes other people in the industry uncomfortable.  Needless to say, Im not happy......

So here is my dilemma.  Im fully capable of managing an entire development team, bringing people together, making it rain, etc etc.  I have a track record of doing so.  Its not like I'm unproven.  Ive had more success in my 4 years out of college than most people have in 10 years occupying a desk.  But NONE of the job postings I find wants someone like me.  They all require ""x to y years experience and nothing out of the ordinary"".  The people in charge won't even look at someone without checking that box first. I cant tell you the number of conversations Ive had where I am asking how many of their other candidates have that many patents and that quick of a career progression, just to have the HR person go back to ""but they have 3 more years experience than you.""  So frustrating.  These people are complete robots.

So Im sitting here with my huge list of accomplishments, that are completely above and beyond the people Im competing with.  But not fitting into the conventional career path and not being considered for positions that I have actually been successful in before.  I get that I am not checking the box, but I don't want to sit around occupying a desk just to make these human robots happy.

79,Help choosing motors for line follower robot,1521027712,"I'm in a little team that has to make a (very fast) line follower bot and I've been tasked with picking the two motors that will make it move. For now, it seems I have three options at hand, but I don't really have much knowledge of this domain so I'll need your help. We're aiming to make the robot as light as possible, preferably under 250 grams. 
I found a couple of options that seemed to fit what we were aiming for:

1st option: weight 82grams
-no load: 646 RPM, 80mA drain
-load: 516 RPM, 380 mA, 0.23 kgcm torque @6V
-stall: 1.5 kgcm torque, 900mA
-9.6:1 geared reducer

2nd option: weight 18 grams
-no load: 1550 RPM, 60 mA
-load: 900 RPM, 170 mA, 0.07 kgcm torque @6V
-stall: 0.16 kgcm torque
-Has an encoder (easier to control)
-10:1 geared reducer

3rd option: weight 18 grams
-no load: 530 RPM, 60 mA
-load: 300 RPM, 170 mA, 0.2kg*cm torque @6V
-stall: 0.45 kgcm torque
-Has an encoder
-30:1 geared reducer

We're planning to use 4cm diameter wheels.
Haven't really looked at 3V variants, I deemed them either too weak or too expensive to be good. If we go for 6V motors, we'll be using two 18650 cells which weight about 50grams each, and another, say, 15 grams for the holder. I've been looking at LiPo cells too, but we can't afford a proper charger with our (very) limited budget. Those motors I gave specs for cost around 13$ each. I can go above that budget if it's for good reason. I'm in Romania, so shipping from around the world can be an issue too. Thanks for the help in advance!

85,I'm starting a new search and need some advice (x-post from r/engineeringjobs),1521008807,"I was going to wait an appropriate amount of time before this crosspost, but I became aware of how often people respond and myself running out of time.

So currently, I'm a senior in mechanical engineering and researcher in aerial robotics/computer vision. My focus of study is in dynamics and controls. I'm trying to sort out what I'm going to do when I graduate. Because of what I do now there is a very clear path towards graduate school, but honestly, since I started my degree I wanted to design mechanisms and machines. My university has almost no focus on that subject (one semester on applied static design, half a semester of system dynamics, and two weeks of material in a mechatronics class), so I can't specialize in it. I've been searching around for jobs and internships in that field and submitted applications to the handful I found, with the usual response of silence.

86,Trying to get into engineering. Is the FE exam enough with minimal experience or need Masters?,1520991894,"Title basically says it all. Currently slotted to take my FE Mech late June. My wonder is will an FE exam be enough to make up for very minimal experience? Graduated in 2016 with BS in BME, concentrated in biomech/MechE minor, thought about and tried the PhD/med school route, so ditched really job searching in industry for a pure research position. 

I'm trying to get back into true engineering in anything MechE related really, med devices or anything BME related would be ideal. Would I need a Masters degree to be competitive with minimal experience, or don't bother with one? I'm feeling very ambivalent about a MS as the engineering school I got my BS from graduates like nearly 2.5x more Master's students, I can't see it being super valuable, or is it?

99,Which MSc should i choose? Should i change career path?,1520959550,"Hello everyone. I am 29 years old and i live in Greece. I graduated as an electrical energy engineer (technical university) and after 5 years working in sales while studying (and some time after) i started working at a multinational corporation (3 months ago), more specifically in the part of the company that has to do with medical machines (ct, mr, x-ray machines etc). I work as a long term planner (not as an engineer); i plan the maintenance of the medical machines for the year and i also organize the (daily) schedule of the engineers. I also talk with customers, execute company orders and tell the engineers when and where they go to fix machine failures. Generally speaking my job is the definition of an office job. However, the big con is that my job is an entry level job so it has THE LOWEST wage allowed in my country. I always wanted to get an MSc and i think its a good career choice to raise my chances of landing a better job elsewhere or getting a promotion.
So here are my questions;

**1. Which MSc should i choose?**  Or should i choose an MBA, is it good for me? Predecessors of my job have gotten a promotion since this is the first step in the company, but many had relevant degrees in the part of the company they went (by the way promotions in my job are 90% changing spots ""left and right"" and getting more money, upwards are VERY few positions filled and almost NEVER changing).

**2. Should i choose a different field as my degree?**  Or should i try to get into medical machines with my MSc now that i work in this sector? Is it a plus or a minus if i am an electrical engineer and switch to medical machines?

**3. Should i change career path?**  While i am not working as an engineer i participate daily in solving engineer's problems (as much as i can) and work with SAP, SBO+ and ServiceMax programs. However that is more in the field of information technology or data proccesing? i still don't know. Should i try with my MSc to pursue a career in this field? Or switch to pure electrical engineering? (which is something i have worked 6months only as a mandatory part of my studies, so no big working experience there).

I 'll probably stay in this company for the immediate future because i like it and the name of the company is a big plus on my cv, however the wage is THE LOWEST as i said. This is fine for now but i can't live like this forever. 
I urge you to be open and do not care if you hurt my feelings, i prefer honesty anyday so please, tell me what you would do in my spot with your knowledge (even moving to another country might be open if i don't see any good solution to my situation). Suggest literally, ANYTHING that you think i should do. Thanks in advance.",AskEngineers,KostasSnow,/r/AskEngineers/comments/845moy/which_msc_should_i_choose_should_i_change_career/
