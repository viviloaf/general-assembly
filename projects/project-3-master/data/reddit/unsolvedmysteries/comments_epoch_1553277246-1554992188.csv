there are some parameters I didn't understand in dimensionning of this cooling chamber (cold room).

we need to add panels to create this chamber. but for the door, I dont know how can I fix it, if I need more panels or not? 

the other problem is how to fix the roof ? because I need this chamber to be stable.

4,How to create a submersible device that reacts to pressure without electronics?,1554988745,"I'm working on a product for the marine industry that dives to a certain depth while being pulled behind a boat.

Naturally, the easiest way to tell depth is from pressure.

The immediate solution is to use electronics to measure pressure. The electronics then control a hydrofoil or sorts to dive up or down. But that means the device needs to be equipped with batteries, be entirely waterproof, etc. 

I'm wondering if there's another way to accomplish this. Perhaps a compressible membrane that gradually changes the angle of the hydrofoil as it dives... but this also seems complicated.

18,Should I do engineering? Please Help,1554953587,"A little about me: I got an offer to study in US and also I hold an offer to study medicine at a good uni ( not US ) 

So, as you can understand from my question, I can study engineering in US ( pretty much anything else too, major&amp;minor), and now I am facing a hard dilemma.

Growing up, my interests generally lied within biology, particularly topics overlapping with medicine ( diseases and stuff ) and I excelled in biology, and I loved other sciences too. But, I dont consider myself a maths person: I dont have a quantitative mind, or that “gift” for problem solving; when presented with questions that require you to apply significant amount of logic and problem solving, I struggle. This is what scares me the most about engineering. I am not afraid of failing classes, as I am hardworking, but at the same time, I believe you have to have that “maths brain” to be successful. 
I am not bad at maths tho, I got A* at A level Maths. 

The truth is, while I love the theoretical side if medicine, I am not a huge fan of practising. I find it boring. 

Tbh, I have always wanted to discover or invent something ( med related ) or become a professor, but knowing the oversupply of phds and how hard it is to get a job in academia, I changed my mind. I am also not interested in doing a lab benchwork for years. 

Money is not my goal, of course I want to be able to pay my bills and have a comfortable life, my main aim is to be successful in my field and make a contribution.

I have a GPA that's a little below a 3.0, have taken all my general classes, and just getting B's has started to become quite difficult for me. I was (and still am) worried about my prospects of getting a job on graduation. I don't have much on my resume to set me apart so I decided to change my approach and look for something that would. 

Eventually a friend of mine got me an internship for this summer at her dad's company and I have no idea what to make of it. It's a software development internship at a well-known genetics company (their word, I hadn't heard of the company until then) and I was told that most of job would be testing input for a program by typing random things into it to try and break it. No actual coding knowledge required. I would be under an electrical engineer for the time I spent there and despite advice from one or two peers telling me it's a good idea, I can't shake the feeling that something's off. 

Is this going to look good on a resume? Is it relevant enough to my major? Is it going to get me valuable technical experience that will help me understand what I need to be doing now to help me be a better engineer? 

I'm very grateful to my friend for allowing me the opportunity, and I don't want to be ungrateful, but I don't know if it's actually relevant to what I'm doing.

48,"Engineers of Reddit, can you offer any advice to a 2012 Mechanical Engineer grad that's yet to work as an engineer.",1554914952,"Hi all! Just found this Subreddit, maybe someone can offer me some helpful advice.

My boyfriend graduated from a decent state school with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2012. Directly after graduating some unfortunate family stuff got in the way and he didn't work for 2 or 3 years. He then worked for a bit doing home renovations, then welding for another company and a year ago he got his current job.

Currently he is working for an aerospace engineering company as a technician. They initially interviewed him for a Mechanical Engineer position but offered him the Tech job instead. Since he's been there in the past year he's applied to multiple engineer positions they've put up but they have never acknowledged his applications. He sees that the only people they actually hire as engineers are non-citizens on a special work visa. The company also does a lot of other shady stuff and he's pretty miserable there.

He has not given up on searching for Mechanical Engineer positions, but he has not been offered a single interview from anyone. We have changed his resume up multiple times, this last edit we took out his graduation year entirely - I know that's what's killing him - no experience and he graduated forever ago!

I simply don't know what advice to give him. He's thought about going back for his Masters but with still no experience will that actually help him or just put him in more debt?

I've suggested him taking some certification courses at our local community college. Last night he found a Mechatronics certification. He's looking into that.

He is currently getting ""unpaid training"" (we'll call it an internship) at a Civil Engineering firm that a co-worker of mine set him up with. That's just one half-day a week. It's not a good company - no one is training him, they ask him to do tasks with zero instruction and the CEO copied by BF in an email chain were the client said nothing but bad things about the work they've done. The CEO initially gave my BF the impression that he would be trained alongside the Civil Engineers to possibly be hired on as a Civil Engineer (he doesn't even want to be Civil, he's Mech) but reneged on that and is now saying he's ""training"" to possibly be given a drafter position (this happened before the ""internship"" even started so it's nothing my BF did). 

Well this went on longer than I thought I would let it. Sorry it's so long.

What are some steps he can take? I told him I would help create a spreadsheet or job board to keep track of every engineer firm in our area so we know when he applied, when to check back, etc. 

Has he completely screwed himself waiting this long to really start the hunt? It just seems like they only want fresh out of school or people with 5+ years of experience.

59,Careers in Design vs Construction - Civil Engineering,1554897028,"Context: Australia - Civil Engineering - Worked 2 years as a graduate and site engineer, 6 months rotation in design management 

Hi everyone,

I work in construction as a civil engineer. I sometimes wonder if I should be working in design instead.

I studied a bachelor degree in civil engineering (graduated in 2017) and initially didn't find a job. I'd tried to get some experience while at university, but was only able to get an internship at my local council department. As such I never got a chance to work in construction nor design while studying. I did some volunteer activities while studying and maintained good grades but I always got very nervous during interviews and didn't make strong impressions in the handful of opportunities I was able to get. At one stage I got to the final round of the recruitment process with a large design consultancy, but alas not to be. At the time I was pretty disheartened that I got so close but couldn't get over the line.

Once I graduated, I struggled to find a job, and ended up relocating to another city which thankfully ended up with me getting my big break. I got a job at a large construction contractor, and have worked on two very large projects straight out the gate (a motorway/tunnel project and a huge prison complex).

In my time working thus far it's been quite a challenging experience. Construction is a heavily people skills oriented environment (my weakness really) and I've had to get my shit together and perform regardless of my general awkwardness. It's for sure been an amazing chance to grow and see a side of the world the very few get to see and I can honestly say that its made me a much more worldly, industrious and grounded person.

The main issue through it that the work itself feels slightly ""dumb"". At times it feels like your sole purpose for being there is to walk around tapping your foot and demanding to know what the hold up is. I wonder a lot what it would mean to actually ""engineer"" things. Right I don't know if I'd call myself an engineer. So much of what I do is just commercial/quality assurance/safety compliance work. Like a high powered admin person.

Did anyone have any perspectives to share? I only know people that ended up working in construction and since I moved, I'm not closely in touch with most of the people I studied with so I don't really have a well fleshed out perspective on how things work in the bigger picture.

So I am a year removed from uni, working as an industrial controls engineer for a small OEM (family run). Recently I was headhunted and offered a job at a large medical devices company, as an operations engineer on a production line. 

I have no idea which one I should go for. 

The OEM is growing extremely fast, making proper all their internal processes, as well as kicking off design on the next generation machines (design cycle of 5 years). If I stay I would easily slide into a managerial role after new people are hired. I perform both R&amp;D tasks and global product support (sometimes travel), and have complete control over custom machine controls design. However the pay is terrible, pay reviews don't exist and I need to pester management to make them happen. I also lack mentors, so most of the time I'm teaching myself. My current supervisor is also hard to work with, the cause of all the office conflict, especially when it comes to ideas that are contrary to him - you can't reason with him at times.

The large medical devices company was where I interned before. They are offering me 24% more salary, full benefits, annual reviews and has subsidised food at their cafeterias. However due to the nature of the company, it's red tape galore. They are also very old school in requiring a minimum number of years before climbing the ladder is possible. The work is also likely to be less interesting to me, and a step in a different career direction.

73,Leave or Stay? Feel like I'm wasting everyones time (mine included),1554859431,"Hello reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago I finally finished up my degree after 6 years and excitedly entered the workforce. It has all been downhill since then.

&amp;#x200B;

First, the good:

The pay and benefits are excellent: $70k base + Full benefits + bonuses in a very low cost of living area.

I've payed down about 1/3 of my student loans this year.

I recently got a new boss who is a great guy.

&amp;#x200B;

The bad:

Basically everything else.

In general, the area is low cost of living for a reason. There is nothing to do unless you are into meth. I grew up in a similar area with my nearest neighbors being miles away and eventually moved into the heart of the city for school. I vowed never to go back and I haven't. As such, my commute is about a half an hour, which isn't bad, but only gets me about halfway to where I actually would want to live. I chose my current living situation because it seemed like a decent compromise, but, unfortunately, it isn't. My current apartment is way too expensive for the area, the lease is strict, the area is only a few steps above being closer to work, but it is all around pretty nice and likely the best I could get. Extending my commute by another half and hour is not really feasible. I'm not willing to drive even further to a place I don't want to be and, especially in the winter, a slight hiccup can easily double the time and make me late.

&amp;#x200B;

The work itself is not in any way satisfying. My desk is in a dingy support building with no windows, terrible lighting, about an inch of quickly accumulating dust (my area gets mopped/cleaned like twice a day to keep up), and an overall ""asylum"" feel. I could go a week where my closest interaction with another person might be hearing their footsteps down the hall. With few exceptions, I have no interest in talking to them anyways. Fortunately, the company has an area that is exactly the opposite that I am describing that I do have access too at the main corporate headquarters buildings, but that is about 10 minutes away and doing my work there really isn't regularly possible.

&amp;#x200B;

The subject of the work is mainly data analysis. Do some stats here, some scripting there, and make the results look pretty. Simple enough. I thought so. My first project, however, was a $5 MM dollar lean six sigma project (something I've never done before). Cool! Quick project experience. Unsurprisingly, I have no idea what I'm doing. I have a mentor, but he doesn't have the time, or seemingly the interest, to help. In fact, at my end of year review he told me that I wasn't progressing well, but that he thinks that it is partially his fault and intends to find me someone with more time. He hasn't. Yes, I have pushed the issue. So, I'm running around without a clue what to do, little in the way of resources, and people watching that already feel like I'm behind. To make matters more interesting, the mentor is my boss, or was until we hired someone in between him and I, and at this point even hearing his, very distinct, footsteps gives me anxiety. The new boss is very nice and knowledgable in the big picture, but is worthless when it comes to actually doing what needs to be done with our tools. He's aware of that and has told me that he can't help with the technical aspects of the job, but also doesn't want to do anything about the mentor issue because he is new and would be stepping on his bosses toes.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I hate even being there and that has caused most productive work to come screeching to a halt. I figured, maybe I'm depressed. It wouldn't be the first time! Went to the doc. Got drugs. Inform work of new medication since the side effects may not be great for the dangerous environment. Get pulled out of my office in the middle of the day by emergency services to be evaluated by the onsite doc. That's pretty fucking embarrassing. Could have been discreet about that. I understand their reason for wanted me to see their doc, but c'mon now the whole building is wondering what happened to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on, but I won't.

&amp;#x200B;

The main issue: 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to leave, but I feel like I can't. I would have to find a new job, preferably closer to where I want to live, and move there before my lease runs out at the end of May. My building wants to know if I'm staying ASAP  and have been harassing me constantly. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no way written in the lease to break it if I were to sign and find something. I'd have to find someone to sublease it which wouldn't be easy for the price/area. To add to the mess, I have no idea if I'll even be able to stay anywhere near this area in another year or so. So, if I were to take a new job and move closer to where I'd like to be, there is a chance that I would have to leave that in a year or so. I feel like it would look bad to have my first two jobs out of school ending without at least a couple years. Do I try to find something better and possibly have to give it up (hitting my resume in the process), or do I stay, try not to drive my car into a tree on the way there, and maybe get lucky enough to be laid off while we are still really slow? I've got about 6-9 months of expenses saved.

&amp;#x200B;

I would not at all be against going back to school. I much preferred school to this. I've basically got an open offer to walk back into the lab I published with in undergrad to do an MS/PHD. I just don't know if I even want to do any of this anymore or if I'd try to switch fields. The school deal also has the issue of possibly needing to move in a year.

77,Which multi-criteria decision analysis algorithms are best for personal analytics?,1554852156,"Main goal: ranking a list of many currently unfinished personal projects/activities (such as finishing a given book, getting a certain certificate, acquiring a particular belt in a martial art, etc) in order of importance according to many ordered criteria (such as difficulty, profitability, pleasure, health, etc) to be established by the agent. By default, the set of criteria is totally ordered but I am open to other ordering structures that are psychologically interesting.

Implementation constraint: should be personally manageable (for instance, should not require much computational prowess to calculate - I can wait hours but not a week).

I've tried testing several MCDA methods over the past years in Excel and Diviz to engage with this problem. I've quit implementing a large share of them because the description became much too cumbersome (for instance, having to fill enormous preference matrices).

Given this constraint, I have so far failed to find anything better than simple weighted-sum models.

86,Ideal Location for Pump in a DIY Aquatic (turtle) Canister Filter,1554844171,"Not too long ago, a clearly abandoned turtle showed up in my alley and he's gone unclaimed for some time, so I'm setting up a habitat for him.

Turtles require a lot of filtration, for which most people use an external canister filter. These filters are expensive to start, use proprietary filter mediums which can be expensive to continually supply, and require proprietary parts to service--not my cup of beer. 

I'm pretty confidant I have all the skills necessary to DIY my own canister into existence and have done considerable research into DIY canisters as well as the general design of commercial ones, so I'm moving onto the planning stage.

In all the aquarium canister filter designs I've seen, the pump is located AFTER the filtration. Commercial canisters use an internal/submersible style pump in the canister, the DIY designs I've seen use an optionally submersible pump outside of a vessel.

To my knowledge, when installing a water filter in other systems (like for your tap water), you install the pump BEFORE any filter so that the filter is under positive pressure rather than vacuum, reducing wear on the pump and preventing the vessel from imploding if it clogs.

Obviously, the optionally submersible \~300GPH pump I intend to buy wont produce enough pressure/vacuum to damage the 4"" or 6"" Sched. 40 PVC pipe I intend to use as my vessel and I won't allow the filter to clog so badly that water can't sufficiently flow, so...  


What's the most ideal location for a pump in this system, before or after the filter?

  
I assume the best set up is to submerge the pump in the tank, and use positive pressure to pump water out to the filter and back into the tank. Lemme know if that's wrong. I assume this because using positive pressure just seems to make more sense, and putting the pump in the tank will help keep it cool (and save me a teeny bit of energy by reducing the load on the tank's heater) as well as reduce noise.",AskEngineers,False,foxtrot7azv,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bbdf7f/ideal_location_for_pump_in_a_diy_aquatic_turtle/

I need to design an automated solution for quality control of parts that are cuts from 5 different shapes of aluminum extrusion to ensure that they are within the tolerance limits. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/KeAG0NF) you can see what those 5 types parts look like.


The machine will only be fed parts of one kind at a time, so the final solution is allowed to require any kind of manual changes/adjustments or have automated changes executed between batches of different kinds of parts, if needed.


My initial idea was to have a conveyor feeding the measuring device of the machine, with the conveyor being fed by a hopper. The measurements of the parts would be done with a mechanical probe fixed to a piston (I don’t know if “mechanical probe” is the correct term. As you can probably tell by now, English is not my main language. I’m talking about a mechanical sensor like [this one](https://ecommerce.unceta.es/media/catalog/product/cache/4/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/d/3/d33460.jpg), which sends a signal to the PLC based on the displacement of the tip) If the part is within the tolerance limits, it will go to another conveyor and, if not, it will be discarded to a box.


I’m stuck in solving how to ensure that, when the pneumatic piston extends to take a measurement of the part, **the mechanical probe can’t miss the part.**


The issue is that I’m not finding a good way to fix the position and orientation of the parts in the “measuring table” or a position of the mechanical probe that ensures that, no matter the kind and orientation of the part, it will not miss. Add to that the machine must be compatible with all 5 different kinds of parts and I’m really lost.

How important is gear ratio?,1554808244,"So, I'm trying to transform a sewing machine table (powered by a pedal, [basically this](https://ebth-com-production.imgix.net/2017/12/15/10/10/32/478f2b6b-74f3-4b9f-b402-a1c6f88d8ba5/JJM_9506.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;w=880&amp;h=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=&amp;auto=format) ) into a pottery wheel, by simply removing the sewing machine, and transfering the vertical movement into a horizontal one to make the wheel go round. 

I'm doing this with very few ressources, I won't be trying to make bevel gears or anything, just plain simple ones out of ""basic"" wood. So I need to figure out how important is the gear-ratio considering the forces required to move the wheel. I'm not very knowledgeable on physics matters, but I would guess that moving a wheel and some clay around doesnt take too much force, and a steady pedalling (if the gears' teeth are smoothed enough to reduce friction as much as possible) would prove to be enough.

21,Career Path Advice: Telecommunications or Firmware,1554778371,"I will be graduating in the spring with and I'm having difficulties with choosing a job so I wanted to receive some input. Currently, I have offers from a major telecommunications company (Company A) and a company specializing in digital audio processing (Company B). I would be doing network validation and testing at the first company and working in the firmware team for the second company.

Company A is well established and it genuinely seems like a good place to work in. They're working with innovative technologies and I expect them to grow a lot during the next few years.  It is also in my hometown which allows me to live at home and save money as I start my career. However, I'm worried that working at Company A will restrict my career to working with networks.  Additionally, most of my work would be doing validation and testing so it's not really an ""engineering"" job. 

Company B pays higher but it's located in a place with a substantially larger cost of living than Company A. Initially, I wanted to study EE because I was interested in audio and signal processing so this company aligns more with the type of work I can do. However, they're a very niche company and I'm worried it's not a place where I can grow professionally as I would in Company A.

56,"How to optimize a wind turbine alongside juggling the different variables such as blade angle, blade shape, and gear system?",1554734266,"Hi guys! I'm currently a teaching volunteer for an organization. We teach kids mainly from middle school to get them interested in engineering. We have lots of different programs. I personally have worked on creating a new one which is all about wind turbines. We focus on keeping it hands-on and learning by doing. The end goal is to build their own wind turbine that they enter into a competition.

So I admit I don't know much about wind turbines. I just graduated with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering but it's not like I ever took a course on wind turbines. Before the class started I built a turbine myself and tested a few configurations so I had at least some experience in the whole process. But it was far from optimized in any way.

The way I went about this is I wanted to make it simple for the students by having decisions be binary. For example, we needed to build a structure to hold everything together. I brought in 3 materials that I could find: hard styrofoam, wood, and PVC. There was a multitude of factors I tried to get them to think about: can we manipulate the shape with the tools available to us, can we add the necessary components to it (generator for example), its ability to stay rooted to the ground, and lastly its ability to dampen vibration. They built each and tested using hub/blades that I had already built.

The other two components we're creating/testing is the gear system and the blades. The generator is fixed because the competition only allows a particular type. So this is where I start to go into territory that I'm less confident about.

The way I went about optimizing the model is we actually start at the generator since it's fixed. I look at the specifications that the manufacturer gives us. It mentions a peak output at 999 RPM and maximum efficiency at 1569 RPM. So the goal is to extract enough energy from the air in order to spin the blades to spin the generator at the peak output RPM (I believe because we want maximum power output for the highest score in the competition not for how efficient it is). If that line of reasoning is incorrect let me know! We were able to get a few types of gears: 64, 32, and 16 teeth. The generator already has an 8 tooth gear attached to it which we can't remove. In order to design the gear system, I need to see at what RPM will the blades spin. But the issue with this is when the blades are not loaded they spin at a very different RPM than they would when loaded. So the first question is, how do I get around this? Do I have to just iterate to optimize? Also, this leads to the whole issue that whenever I change any variable from this point on, say the blade shape now the RPM will be different.

My first thought about handling this is just having a simple gear system that I keep fixed while I test the other variables such as blade shape, length, angle. But while testing some of these variables I run into the issue that maybe this longer blade is spinning slower but it's still extracting more energy than the short blade and I just can't tell because with this particular gear system the short blade will be outputting more energy on the generator.

So how do engineers handle juggling all these variables? Is the only way by just doing an obscene amount of tests?

Any help is appreciated! And I apologize about the length of the post.",AskEngineers,False,AdamDoUrden,/r/AskEngineers/comments/baukos/how_to_optimize_a_wind_turbine_alongside_juggling/

58,Followup: I dropped my phone into a deep place.,1554733468,"Hi Reddit! 

CONTEXT: Posted this about a week ago and I've been trying to get it out since then.
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/b74l6i/solutions_to_retrieving_objects_stuck_in_a_deep/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share 

My phone fell into this deep narrow space. It's 1.5m deep, 30cm across and about 1cm wide. There are walls on the sides so it's similar to a box. One of the walls is angled so as it goes deeper down, it gets narrower. Here's a picture to reference: http://imgur.com/gallery/r7rNXiV

Things I've tried:

1. Tried to hook up my phone as it has a small loop of string attached to it, but it was really hard to as there's hardly any light going down into it. Shining a torchlight into another phone doesn't work either, though I miraculously managed to get a photo.

2. Tried to use two wider tape measures to try to pull it up (Due to the L shape), but I found out about the angled wall.

Here are some suggestions you guys suggested, but I ran into a bit of trouble.

1. Many of you guys suggested to use wire hangers and I do have them, but have no idea how to use them to retrieve my phone. :-( Also the depth is pretty deep at 1.5m, so that's a problem.

2. Some also suggested to use string to loop over the phone and pull it up but it's really hard to do given the lack of light.

3. About using tape and dragging it up against the wall: Tried this, but tape kept getting itself stuck onto the surface of the walls.

4. I don't have mercury. (LOL)

I know this may be a very lengthy post and I really do hope that I don't come off as being too demanding or anything. I really thank all of you for having given me valuable input! I'll be able to try and get it out again next week so any advice before then is gladly welcome!

60,Shouldn't the keyway on electrical motors be designed to shear at the maximum torque the motor can produce?,1554727760,"We have specced out some motors and our customer as inevitably applied too much load to them, and it broke the motor shaft.

Am I wrong to think that the motor manufacturer should have designed the keyway and specced a key that would allow it to shear under the maximum torque the motor could produce? By maximum I mean stallout torque. Our customer didn't even lock the motor up or trip it's thermal reset so they weren't over-exerting it *that* significantly.

I had previously obtained a couple of references from people, but I am worried that if they get wind of these rumors, they might give a bad reference.

I am a technician operating as an associate engineer at my current place of work. I've been a technician for over 10 years now.

At a certain point of my career I became very good at what i did and was lucky to make my voice heard and find the right people to echo my words and help me move forward in my career.

I've been with this company for what is now 6 months and my manager says I'm doing a great job and has been giving me tasks to work on to improve myself. For example, one of the tasks I'm actually most proud of is to give feedback on designs. I literally sift through peoples designs and give them feed back on if this will work or not. Sometimes its components sometimes its a system. As i do it more and more my manager gives me tips on how to look at it from an engineers eyes. **I've learned quite a lot and I owe this person a lot already.**

9,Foldable quadcopter arms spring loaded,1554607128,"We are trying to make a foldable quadcopter for a competition. The competition consists of launching a rocket to an altitude of 5000ft, where the payload (or in this case, quadcopter) will be ejected, where 4 arms will fold out of the chassis and will need to guide itself to a landing zone.

We want the arms to be spring loaded with a torsion spring so that it naturally wants to be extended out like [so] (https://m.imgur.com/a/sy8xpEf). When it is in the rocket, the arms will be folded inside the chassis and under force due to the spring. Once the pneumatic piston pushes it out, the arms will deploy automatically.

18,"Question about ICE design, material science and just a general thought experiment.",1554585838,"As said in the title, I'm having a thought experiment about engine design. 

I was thinking about how tolerances in engines affect cold start emissions and blowby when hot as well as general power. Mostly due to rewatching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4QyxGE2414) video about F1 stuff. 

My thinking is the following, we use aluminium as piston material because it is strong enough and light and cheap for the needs OEMs have. However due to how much it expands at heat, unless you have a ton (figuratively) in it of silicon you'll have worse emissions at cold start because your tolerances are out of gap with how the parameters are when hot. However, aluminium is not ideal as a sleeve material because it's not that strong or not strong enough. 

This got me thinking about what if I wanted to design an engine that has the same tolerances cold and hot in regards to piston to cylinder clearances. But without using various steels as those are too heavy/dense to use as a piston and add too much weight to the rotating assembly.

So this is where I'm at right now with materials researched roughly and all that. Titanium could be used, however its not very good in friction, so you'd need a coating on both the pistons skirts and cylinder walls. Beryllium copper is said to be quite strong (comparable to some steels), resistant to wear and while not as light as aluminium its lighter than steel, plus the fact that BeCu transfers heat better than steel, titanium and I think aluminium. And then you have some properly out there materials like AlBeMet (62% Be, 38% Al) which was formerly used in F1 but banned because of the way it failed over there (which was basically pouring Be dust straight into the atmosphere and deemed too dangerous upon engine failure). As far as I know you can use AlBeMet as cylinder material as well as piston and you could even coat them to reduce friction even more. Basically making it somewhat ideal, right?

If costs werent an issue during engine design and you didnt need to go to the lengths F1 does with their designs (ie making the operating window razor edge thin) am I wrong in thinking some kind of Beryllium compound might be the answer here?

If any of you have a better material you'd want to point me to I'd be much obliged. Keep in mind, I'm not actively designing an engine, just having a thought experiment about all of this.

The long term career outlook isn't so hot though, and now that I'm a bit more mature and a much better student, I am ready to tackle the field of study that I truly should have started in: computer engineering. I certainly don't want to continue on to further education in life science. However, this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill ""do I get a second bachelor's or just go for a master's"" post. I'm already pretty dead-set on getting a second bachelor's since I don't really have any overlapping coursework outside of gen-eds. I'm thinking that it will overall be cheaper than a master's (taking prereqs into account), plus I will get a good foundation. The idea is that I'll just make the switch, find work, and have my employer pay for any necessary further education following that.

My real questions are in regards to the timing and financial realities of this transition. I've already been accepted to start on the coming fall term, but I can always defer and save more money. You might be inclined to say ""save enough money to cover the degree and then jump in."" While I see the value in that line of thinking, there's a few catches I'm having a hard time dealing with. First of all, I fucking hate my current job and I seriously want to leave. Second of all, opportunity cost: the sooner I start, the sooner I can become an engineer and have a real career path. 

A bit about the financial variables involved: I have zero student loans due, nor have I taken any out. I still have the full cap on my federal loan available. I will have a minimum of $20K saved if I keep working until August, but I could double that if my mental health holds up until December. Tuition is ~$11K annually, and I've budgeted out my living expenses to be around $10.5K (will have to cover this with some kind of part-time work). I'll have to be in school for about 3 years, maybe less (I'll be 25 when I finish if anyone's curious). All in all, including any internships and part time work, I estimate that I will shake out with 20-25K in debt if I choose to start in August, and about half that if I choose to start in January.

I run a welding shop in Haiti.   
Our arc welders run on small 5kVA diesel generators, a Kipor and a Daewoo.  
Lately we've had some equipment failures due, I suspect, to voltage regulation issues.  


So I'm thinking of 2 pieces to a solution.  


First, can anyone recommend a surge protection device for something of this size? I wanted to hardwire it on, like a whole house type unit, but I wasn't sure if there were any for a low load rating like we're dealing with.  


Second, would it be a terrible idea to add a capacitor (maybe wire in a well pump soft-start cap?) to the output since the arc welders tend to give a harsh surge draw when they are running?

43,Engineers and Designers. Advice on creating a better relationship between the two.,1554554441,"I have recently been put in to a unique situation, looking to get some insight from all perspectives in relation to technical documentation and drawing packages and the responsibilities of parties involved.  First a little background, I am a mechanical engineer working for a large company with about 8 years experience in manufacturing and project management.  I recently was assigned a role as CAD manager, someone to lead a group of designers (not engineers, but also not drafters) and determine workload and resource planning and act more as a conduit between management, fabrication, and our mechanical and electrical engineering departments.  Ideally, the CAD department is responsible for 3D solid modeling and assemblies, and creating drawings for fabrication and assembly.

Prior to coming aboard I was told that there was a “CAD problem” and my main goal was to fix it.  Problems such as engineers just dropping in on designers saying I need this work done now, designers being overloaded, no planning, high turnover, etc.  and it would be my responsibility to resolve the issues and straighten out the “CAD problem”.  After being here a few months, I got a good grasp on the resource and planning management but have come to the belief that the “problems” in CAD that I needed to resolve stem from the processes in place and and that CAD was being unfairly blamed for systemic issues.

There seems to be a big disconnect between the roles and responsibilities of engineers and those of designers.  In my eyes, the engineers are responsible in determining form, fit and function, where the designers are responsible for ensuring it is properly documented to allow manufacturing/assembly of the components.  What I have observed is some engineers doing modeling and drawings themselves, using poor and inefficient design practices, and improper drawing documentation.  I don’t mean the functional design is incorrect, but how solid models and assemblies are created within our CAD software.  This leads to situations where once the CAD team receives the work to complete the drawing documentation, its in a poor state that requires rework to correct the inherent modeling and can have significant impacts if lower level models and assemblies are done improperly.  CAD inevitably ends up being blamed for any slippage.   Often times engineers do not provide enough information to complete models or designs such as design intent or BOMs.  I have also had engineers redlining drawings done by designers calling out apparent errors in formatting such as how dimensions are called out and part balloons are used, assembly level structures, wording in notes, basically nothing that has any impact on form fit and function.  These engineers are telling trained technical designers how to do their jobs and it creates a lot of friction between the groups.  There is just a level of disrespect between some of the engineers and designers along with the arrogance of younger engineers dealing with older designers who aren’t technically engineers, but have a vast amount of experience and knowledge.

So how do your organizations deal with the relationship between engineers and CAD designers? What are the roles and responsibilities for the engineers (both mechanical and electrical) and the designers?  How do your processes work from determining a design to documenting it.  What types of conflicts have you run in to in the past and how was it resolved?

Bottom line is I want to do what’s best for the group I lead, but also want to do what’s best for the company as a whole.  It shouldn’t be an engineers vs. designer/drafting battle but how we can have a seamless working relationship that leads to satisfied customers, quality work, and personnel that are proud of the work they complete.",AskEngineers,False,linerider1260,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ba3wrx/engineers_and_designers_advice_on_creating_a/

45,Which grade stud to use to attach motorbike brake disc?,1554549185,"I've bought a spare set of wheels for my motorbike to use for a second set of tyres. The bike is a 2006 Honda XR125L (specifically an XR125-L6). I know from looking at the parts fiche that the stud is a metric M6x16mm. For a Honda one I would have to buy from a parts shop overseas (bike has been out of production for almost a decade, there are few suppliers with parts) so would take a while to turn up, and is very expensive for just a simple stud (there's a fixed shipping cost). I can find loads of generic mild steel studs on eBay, with most being grade 8.8. My preference would be to source a suitable generic stud from eBay for a fraction of the price and quicker turn around time, but I don't want to jeopardise mine (or other road user's) safety.

The brake disc is attached to the wheel via five of these studs, all the same size and equally spaced around the wheel. One of the studs is missing - the brake disc was removed by the breaker's yard I bought the wheels from. There is no damage to the hub, they just undid the stud when removing the nuts that hold the disc on (I assume the nut was seized or just tighter than the stud and hub were, they sold the disc separately).

My question is, would a grade 8.8 stud be enough for the shear(?) strength the braking force of the disc would place it under? The bike (wet) and rider weigh about 220kg combined. The bike has a hydraulic front disc brake (240mm diameter), and it's a 125cc (small displacement engine) dual sport (on-road and off-road) bike, so is not a performance bike, with top speed being about 100-110kph.

I usually just replace bolts with the same or higher strength, but with this being a stud, I can't read the info off the top of it to find out its grade. Can anyone give me an idea if I'm going to exceeding the spec of the bolt (and safety margin) if I use grade 8.8? I can't find any 10.9 studs on eBay, but even if I need to go to a specialist, I think it will still be cheaper and quicker than new old stock.

Prior to my moving in in September, they stripped the unit to its rough frame and totally rebuilt it, including swapping the kitchen with the bedroom.  

The plans include from what I think I recall a cross section of a generic header that didn't appear to involve any on-site work done by the engineer of record prior to the demolition work judging by the construction timeline on other units.  The unit next to mine was demolished and rebuilt within the scope of a single TI permit.  

The deficiencies of my remodel are starting to show.  Visible seams are starting to appear where my ceiling meets the walls and what was originally a quiet unit when I toured it is subject to deafening creaking and squeaking and now audible cracking as the tenants above me walk (or lumber and plod, who knows) around.  The problem has gotten significantly worse over the last months and the cracking is disconcerting.  

I do not know if they demolished the ceiling but I presume as much.  If they did, I would presume they would have seen the issues with how these buildings warp and settle and sagging joists seem like they would have been evident.  Leaving them alone seems irresponsible.  

After I raised issue that this is getting worse, they are replacing the 50-year-old carpet in the unit above me finally, but I have a feeling the remodel was defective.  I had a nightmare where my neighbors finally came through the ceiling but I think that's overblown...maybe?

Shouldn't the structural engineer have inspected the unit after they demolished it and before construction started?  Would contractors have seen the sagging joists and had an obligation to remediate them?  Any other way they could have screwed up?

56,How are cross-wind limits on an airplane determined and what is the limiting factor? Is it mechanical or aerodynamic?,1554516652,"## Background

This came from a [question I asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/b9ud54/hella_crab/ek7jkxg/?context=3) over at /r/Aviation about [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/b9ud54/hella_crab/)

For a little background, I do have a PhD in mechanical engineer but I focus on uncertainty quantification and validation of modeling and simulation. So it is a bit out of my wheel house but should give you an idea where I am coming from

## Question

Where does the maximum cross-wind limit of an airplane spec come from? And is the limiting factor aerodynamic or mechanical. 

On the mechanical side, planes in a cross-wind often land at a crab angle that puts immense side-load on the gear. So I wonder if that is where the limit comes from. For example, if a pilot were to land at the exact crab angle to counter the max wind, what are the loads and can the gear handle it. 

Or, is the gear speced/designed for what is already set as the max limit from the aerodynamic loads and stability of landing with the crosswinds?

And, on the gear note, I was surprised that these types of landings aren't logged for fatigue analysis since they put a lot more wear on the gear.

Background: I am a chemical engineering undergraduate conducting research in a faculty lab. My experiment focuses on measuring dissolution rates of gases in molten salt using a furnace and camera setup. I take a picture of a trapped gas bubble every x seconds, and the data is compiled in a TIF file. Since the inside of the furnace is dark, I shine a light through a slit (3'' length, 0.5'' width) in the furnace. This slit runs through the entire furnace, with the opposite end open to the camera that takes the pictures. The inside of the furnace has just enough room for a 1'' diameter reactor that contains the molten salt and gas bubbles. I run the data through a segmentation software and record the change in diameter of the bubble over time. 

Problem: The light I use is pretty sh@t. It has a narrow (\~8mm) opening and creates a stark lighting gradient in the image (parts of the picture have a lot of light and others don't). The light also casts dark shadows on the glass tubing used to capture the gas bubbles, which interferes when I try to segment the data (the gas bubbles appear dark and so does the glass trap used to capture them). I want to use a light that would uniformly supply light to the entire slit to minimize such discrepancies. The light needs to be relatively bright, although I would like to have the option to adjust the brightness. It also needs to be heat resistant (temperatures reach \~800C in the slit itself, but this would be less of an issue if I positioned the light a short distance outside the reactor). 

Any recommendations on lamps or lights I could use would be deeply appreciated. I have already considered high pressure sodium bulbs (though I'm not completely sure this would be the best option).

78,How to go about quitting a team you are a vital member of?,1554487327,"A little background, overall I like the people I work with and my boss, however I don't particularly like my job. We are working on a smallish project that is vital to the company's future. I have been with the company for 3 years and at the beginning of the year transitioned to a role where I support this project full time, where for the previous 8 months or so I was doing my normal job as a production engineer and lending my time to this project. Presently I am the only local engineering support for the project. We have technical support in another state and the project manager lives in a third state. There are other people onsite supporting the project who are very experienced in this technology, just none of them are engineers.

There are a few reasons that I want to quit. The first is that I am just not happy in my location. I have been here 8 years now and we have been feeling for a while like it is time for me and my wife to move on. I would like to live in a place that facilitates our hobbies, which my current location doesn't. My company has only one location that I would consider moving to, but that leads to my next point. If I were to stay with the company and move to this location I would probably have to move into a technical support role, which I initially thought I wanted as my career path, however, if I did that I would likely support the same technology for my entire career until either it is phased out or I retire. The idea of that is pretty depressing to me. I am not particularly passionate about what we make and I feel like there is something better that I could be doing. In other words, I am just not happy with my prospects here or elsewhere with my company. 

I am also awaiting a decision regarding my application to a Master's program that I would pursue online while I continue my work. If I get in, upon completion I would likely change fields. 

The current plan has the project completing at the end of 2019, however, I think that is too optimistic and projects in my company tend to take longer than they are planned. 

The timeline that I am looking at is sticking around, supporting the project, and then quitting around this time a year from now when my wife completes her doctorate. Best case scenario, the project is returned to operations between late 2019 and early 2020 and there is minor post work that needs to be addressed and then I can be honest with my boss about my intentions to leave, find a location that I am happier in, and find work in my future field. However, I am far more concerned about the worst case scenario, where the project is delayed and I will be looking to leave before the project is completed. The local and remote support would be able to carry out the project to completion, but I am already feeling some strange pre-guilt about the concept.

79,House Flipping: Waste of time when you could do skilled labor?,1554486443,"I have no illusions of buying a house and turning around and selling it for 40k profit likes its easy. I am wary that its a saturated market and there's a bunch of people exactly like me considering house flipping. From what I've read, most of the value of flipping a house comes in from your own manual labor...     

So as an engineer, is it a time-effective investment? Especially as an engineer that only has base level woodworking and plumbing experience? The way I imagine it is sure I could buy a place, sink 3 years into it and hundreds of hours of labor, collect some appreciation and renovation profits. But when all is said and done maybe I'll be making $10 an hour? Maybe too many people have this idea, and some are far more skilled at trade type work and can do it far more effectively than me?           

I was kind of thinking it would be a potential thing to do in grad school, save up enough money from my job and buy a shit house before starting. I could live in the house and work on during my own hours so that I can focus on school when I need to and make my own hours. 

On the other hand, I'm thinking freelance work involving skills I can relate back to my day job just makes more sense. Because I'd be more competitive, can improve my career skills, and its skilled labor so I can command a higher /hour.

18,2nd Undergrad in Engineering,1554424797,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I want your opinion on getting a 2nd undergrad in engineering (MechE most likely or CompSci). Basically I graduated last year with a degree in health sciences and can't find many opportunities for employment, much less a real career (currently make minimum wage in my field with no options for growth). I was originally an engineering major but switched because I wanted to pursue physical therapy or pre-med. Both of which I am no longer interested in (especially PT, field seems to be over-saturated in a few years, little opportunity for career growth). 

So now I am contemplating going back to school to get my degree in something useful and employable. In a perfect world I would get a masters but I don't think I could get accepted with my current undergrad classes. With an undergrad I would already have all electives and some major prereqs completed. The downside with a second undergrad is I feel it looks poorly on me and I wouldn't be joining the workforce until I am 25 or 26. Also a lot more student loan debt.

I have read a few posts about it and all of them had good information, but I still have this sense of... I don't want to say doubt, but more of a nagging feeling that I *need* to know if I am going down the right path.

A bit of backstory:

I am 27 years old and currently going through an existential crises. Due to reasons I did not do well in middle or high school when it came to math or math related subjects -- not from a lack of aptitude, but rather lack of interest. I did have my moments where things started to click and I ended up passing all of my classes, but I know I could have done better. 

I went straight into the workforce after high school and worked customer service jobs. I am at the end of my rope with that sort of field. It is soul-crushing in the sense that I feel like I am droning on without challenge, without purpose. I ended up going to college for Criminal Justice in hopes to pursue a dream of mine to be a police officer. I have worked in law enforcement in different capacities for the past five years, but realized that I am not a right fit for it.

I spent some time thinking and I realized that I need something that is challenging to me on an intellectual level. I am one of those people that is not satisfied with just knowing *how* to do something. I need to know *why.* 

I have handicapped myself by not doing this earlier, by not pushing myself to excel like I know I can. I have since started to review and study mathematics in preparation for my math placement test. The greatest level of mathematics I ever attempted was Algebra and Geometry. I did take a Physics class, but again I didn't pay attention for reasons. I am finding that my studies are fun. It isn't fun in the sense that I absolutely love math, but fun in the sense that it is challenging. I have spent the last two weeks studying every day for 4 hours a day. I plan on going through Pre-Algebra to Calculus in 4 months, and reaching at least Trigonometry within 2 for my placement test. 

What has me concerned is that I am finding some simple abstractions difficult to mentally grasps. I have a sense of brain fog when it comes to performing mathematical operations in my head. I can work it out on paper, but it takes a considerable amount of concentration to do it in my head and I still have to check with a calculator or work it on paper to make sure I am right. I have a tendency to skim read and have a shorter attention span than I would like, but I am working on it. The past two weeks have shown me that I can definitely take the time to sit down and work.

There is so much more I could say about me and about my anxiety with this whole ordeal. I want to work in a respectable job that makes decent money and challenges me in an intellectual way. I absolutely abhor customer service and general labor. I have an interest in Robotics and Aerospace. I am going to speak to an Advisor in a couple weeks to see what sort of classes I will need to take. I am excited to get started, nervous that I might not be a right fit, and scared that I am running out of time to figure this stuff out.

Any sort of advice, anecdotes, or questions are welcome. 

TLDR; It took me a long time to decide to work toward becoming an Engineer and I am worried that my shortcomings will hinder my ability to make that happen. I have an general aptitude for mathematics and currently studying on my own to prepare for college courses. Please help me clarify some concerns.

None of what he said really surprised me except that the material for the pressure vessel casing and heat exchangers appears to be carbon steel.

I don't get that at all.  In petrochemical applications, you would *never* use carbon steel for hot hydrogen service due to risk of a rupture from hydrogen embrittlement compromising the ductility and yield strength of the pressure vessels.  We'd at minimum use chromium-molybdenum steel.  

I get that the high stress components like the turbine shaft are going to be made out of resistant materials like inconel or some other nickel superalloy, but how is a carbon steel pressure vessel not an absolutely enormous safety concern? 

I'm very confused about this.  Maybe it's that there isn't enough pressure for it to be a concern, maybe they are just accepting the regular failure of components with frequent replacements, but I'm really highly doubtful.

Worked in a completely different field for close to 10 years and have recently made the jump back in the field. I live in the US in New England in a fairly HCOL area. 

I managed to get hired as a drafter at 46k fairly quickly last January and spent about 9 months there building up some experience for my resume. The job was ok but I wanted to find something closer to home. This leads me to where I am now. I originally applied to a drafting position and negotiated my initial salary to reflect that. Their goal was to train me for a bit and then ease me into an engineering position and eventually a project manager. 

When I negotiated this salary I asked for 50k and they countered with 48k to start and bump to 50k at 6 months. Ok, great! Except they hired me as a Staff Engineer 1 at this rate.

I am just now finishing my master’s degree in EE (signal processing and power systems mixture).

· Work will be same as USA hours. (will be evenings in the remote location)

· Travel for installs up to 4 weeks at a time (most cases will be 3 weeks or less) 

· Travel every 3rd week to office regardless of installs.

The energy then needs to electrolyze water into hydrogen, PEM electrolysis is about 80% efficient leaving you with about 68kWh worth of hydrogen. An Ionic liquid piston compressor is about 90% efficient, the loss leaves the hydrogen worth around 61kWh. The hydrogen then needs to be passed into a fuel cell, which can be up to 85% efficient (with heat scavenging), which leaves you with 51kWh. For reference the internal combustion engines 90% of us use in our cars now are only about 20% efficient, factor in shipping, drilling and refining, then you get something much less efficient than hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

What is a good transmission frequency for transmitters in a building that is heavily concrete construction where there won't be interference causing a loss of signal at a distance of 10 to 20 feet.

What would be a good board to use for the main unit that allows me to upload my logic/code for the different transceivers, and allows me to use a network to differentiate between transceivers?

What type of network would be recommended? I've seen a lot of information about mesh networks, and they seem easy to use, but I was curious if there are better methods for creating a system of transceivers with each having their own ID.

I have spent the past year sending my resume to other companies for entry level design/analysis engineering positions but I always get rejected.

I spend a lot of time training myself on C, Matlab, and Solidworks in my spare time. I also studied CFD in school. I am familiar with all those programs and list them as skills on my resume, but the only way to get an employer's attention is by showing that I have used those skills in a work setting, which I have not.

I've decided to start with a TI EVM Board ( [DRV10970EVM](http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau673/slau673.pdf) ) and go from there. I am using a Maxon motor EC-Max 22 ([Datasheet](https://www.maxonmotor.com/medias/sys_master/root/8830475206686/2018EN-222.pdf)) motor. I've configured the board to run with trapezoidal commutation with hall ICs with 30 degree BEMF hall sensor offset (both jumpers floating). Overall the motor seems to run well, except for a tiny bit of jitter at high speeds, but I am having trouble getting it to run as hard as I need it to.

With the inbuilt PWM signal set to 100% (verified) the motor only seems to run at about 2100RPM with the load I've put on it (out of a 12k RPM max at 12v), and the controller is only drawing about 350ma. With no load it does get up to 12000 easily. The load is only a small fan. While I'm not expecting 12000RPM, I would expect it to be able to do more than this. Even the brushed motor that I'm replacing can drive it harder at 12v.

The below oscilloscope images are taken from the first phase and respective hall IC output under 5% and 100% duty cycles. I honestly can't make sense of why the controller isn't driving the motor harder, as it's nowhere near its 1A output limit. I feel like I'm missing something, any insight would be appreciated.

Hello,

Does anyone know of this kind of a job exists (what would be common titles?)? I have worked at several start ups where within first week I realized that what they promised to investors was very unrealistic. It was either outright impossible (cuz physics), timeline was way off (realistic would be &gt;2x) or simply not much better than competitor. Is there a job that basically takes the start up's technology pitch and dissects it for the investor to make a more informed decision? This would involve doing research on the technology and what is currently out there, feasibility etc.

The motor is more than powerful enough to handle the load, but the problem is that the only way to attach the load to the motor shaft is using a single set screw, through a flanged hub. So all of the torque gets applied through this single screw, basically.

Other than custom machining a keyed flange hub, is there some best practice for connecting motor shafts to large moment loads?

97,Need help understanding power MOSFET datasheets &amp; PWM frequencies,1554317842,"Hi! I hope this is the right place to ask about this.

&amp;#x200B;

To explain shortly what this is about, I have two 3D printers with similar motherboards and I want to edit the firmware to achieve the best safety regarding the specifications of the MOSFETs used.

&amp;#x200B;

The MOSFETs in question:

* ON Semiconductor FDD8780 - [datasheet](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/FDD8780-D.pdf) \- for the  extruder heater (3.6Ω, 12V)
* Winsok WSK220N04 - [datasheet](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/WSK220N04_C148446.pdf) \- for the hotbed (0.9Ω, 12V PCB heater) on one board
* Vanguard  VS40200ATD - [datasheet](http://www.vgsemi.com/kindeditor/attached/file/20180208/20180208111035_4173.pdf) \- for the same hotbed on the other board

&amp;#x200B;

Now, by default, the firmware pulses both heaters with about 7.6 Hz. But in the firmware config I can adjust that frequency and it says that I should keep the MOSFET spec in mind when deciding on a frequency. I already asked there but didn't get any specific answers and I wanted to ask experts on electronics in general, not only 3d printing :)

&amp;#x200B;

I always thought slower would be better but when checking the graph of the ""Safe Operating Area"" I am getting the impression that faster = better? Also, I already heard that RDSon and the issue of heat dissipation is important but I guess those are fine since the manufacturer chose to use those components. Or does frequency also play a role with RDSon?

&amp;#x200B;

So does it make any difference if I use 7, 30, or 60Hz PWM? Is one of those frequency well suited for all 3 MOSFETs?

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate some pointers on how to understand the datasheets so I can do my own research on the safe operation of those things in the future!

I’m in my late 20’s, graduating in a year. I just received a job offer for an engineering position within my state govt, it’s been a long interview process consisting of multiple rounds. The final offer is contingent upon the results of a fingerprint based background check that references the FBI’s national database.

Unfortunately in my teens and early 20’s I made some poor choices that 100% are not a reflection of the person I am today, but on paper it looks bad.

They aren’t distribution charges, only possession, and I am NOT a convicted felon, those charges have been dismissed. I am however convicted of one misdemeanor.

I have completed 3 of 4 years of an engineering degree in Ontario 2 years ago. Since then I have taken time off school to work and to figure out what I really want to do. Long story short I want to get back into engineering, I just have 1 more year left.  However, apart from school and some minor involvement in clubs, I have no other experience in the field. I did have a co-op at one point but it was cut short by a sports injury. I think it is unwise to finish off the last year with no direct work experience, because it will make finding an entry level job very hard after graduation while also taking on more debt. I know I screwed up by not getting enough experience earlier in school from clubs and co-ops, but this is my current situation. So I have been trying to get co-op experience before I go back to school to finish, hopefully during this summer or maybe over a longer term. The problem is I cannot use school resources to find a co-op because I am no longer a student, which makes even finding the opportunities let alone getting a job very difficult. Added to the fact that I have no experience and the last time I was in school was in 2017 (2 years ago), I am not an ideal job candidate.

Sol. A - How I am trying to solve this problem:

1.  Make a long list of engineering companies

2. Looking at their career websites, calling them, or walking in

3. Applying to a job, or in the absence of one, sending in my CV to human resources who I talked with on the phone

4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 until successful

A long and lengthy process for sure. You might say I’ll eventually find something, but given my time off school and my lack of experience it could just be a pipe dream.

Sol. B - It may be better to do the following:

1.  Go back to school this fall

2. Join a club and get very serious about it

3. Network like crazy

4. Go to every job fair

5. Use contacts and school resources to find a job after graduation (still no co-op experience though, which will make it tough to find a job - maybe impossible in which case the added debt is worthless and burdensome)

12,[Civil] Changing jobs because of racist employer?,1554307957,"I'm an EIT only a year or so into my first job out of school. I work for a reasonably large firm with offices in several states. I work out of a very small satellite office in a mid-size city. In addition to running our primary office in my state a couple hours away, my immediate supervisor has a large executive role in the company, used to own his own firm, and is just kinda one of those people who knows a lot of people in his city and mine.  

For whatever reason, I guess my boss has decided to start making a lot of blatantly racist/sexist/homophobuc remarks around me when he's down here for business and whatnot. It started with little problematic ""jokes"" that made me uncomfortable, but I rationalized away as innocuous enough (i.e. ""look at the fag in the Prius""). Last week he crossed way over the line, though--he was reading the news on his phone while we were waiting for people to show up for a meeting, and without any sort of indication that he was kidding or being ironic (not that it's a joke would make it ok) he started muttering things like ""typical fucking n_____ers"" about the news stories.  

I'm just so completely disgusted. Obviously I didn't say anything to him or HR, because I'm a coward. I don't want to lose my job and endanger my chances of future employment and work verification for my P.E. for the privelage of lecturing a brick wall. I sure as hell don't want to keep working for him, though.  

I don't think it's a great idea to tell future interviewers about all of that, though, despite it being far and away the primary reason I want to quit. I think there's a real risk that they wouldn't believe me--especially because there's a reaonable chance any given prospective future employer knows my current boss professionally and thinks of him as a pretty good guy. It also might make me seem like a slander/HR risk.  

There are other, smaller things I don't like about my job though. For example, my supervisor is so busy with his other roles in the company that it's incredibly difficult to get feedback and responses on anything--often *months* of reminders via email and phone to get him to sign off on things. I'm worried even that crosses the line of talking negatively about a previous employer (although I could spin it honestly into how it helped me learn to work independantly or something). Or it would be nice to have actual in-person coworkers to get to know, versus working completely by myself as I do right now. I've also been pigeonholed into a specific facet of civil engineering that's been useful experience, but I'm not interested in doing for the long term.  

Anyway, all that to ask-- how should I navigate this situation? Other than the whole racism thing, do the reasons I mentioned for wanting a new job come across as supervficial/arbitrary?

21,Is it possible to design a high powered vacuum cleaner from a 12V DC motor,1554293430,"I am currently designing a device that can pick up 20 kid's plastic balls from one box and transfer them all into another box. I have decided to use a vacuuming method to vacuum up the balls as my way of picking up the balls. Right now I'm just testing if my idea can just pick up one ball. But anyway, I'm planning to use a 12V DC motor that comes with 18,800 RPM and 4.9kg/cm torque connected to a 120mm diameter centrifugal impeller made of plastic to provide suction. This is all then attached to the top of an L shape pvc pipe of 120mm diameter at the top to fit the impeller and motor, and 80mm diameter at the bottom for the ball fit through. I am also powering this device with 8 1.5V AA batteries and won't be able to use other sources.

At this point I've been doubting if this potential vacuum would even have the sucking power to even vacuum up just one of these 65mm diameter balls. If this device fails which it likely will, would it be that my 12V DC motor isn't powerful enough, or my pvc pipe is too wide or something else. I've read online that it's something to do with a good CFM volume or airflow volume for good suction power, but I'm not too sure what component of the vacuum cleaner would provide this.

58,"Career Advice for Young, Already Employed Mechanical Engineer",1554223966,"I received my MS in June of last year and my BS a year before that. I currently work for the Federal Government at a regional utility and am generally happy with my work as I get my feet wet and learn about how everything is working here and how I fit into it. However, an opportunity at the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) has recently come up, and I'm trying to weigh out whether I should pursue it or not, and would like some dispassionate, arm's length advice and commentary. Here are the knots my brain is currently tying itself into: 

Arguments for moving:

1. The work location is more convenient and healthy for me. Currently, I have to drive from one suburb through the city into another suburb. Traffic isn't terrible, as I'm usually going in the opposite flow of most of the traffic, but it's still 30 minutes in the morning and 30-45 minutes most days in the afternoon. Both biking and bussing would be 2 hours each way. The new office would be significantly closer, and I could either bike or bus there in about 40-45 minutes, possibly allowing me to get rid of one of the cars, not to mention getting a workout while doing the commute, saving some time from the rest of my day. 

2. The ACE has a much larger footprint throughout the world, potentially allowing me to move in the middle to distant future. My wife wants to get a graduate education that's not currently available in our city, so we expect to move when our oldest finishes high school in about 10 years' time. I could probably still get work wherever I went, but being at ACE might grease the wheels a little more.

3. The ACE work is more likely to be larger in scale, and will probably help me develop more as a professional. Most of what I and my colleagues currently work on are a bunch of relatively small projects (think 200 to 1000 sf radio sites and substation control houses) while the ACE position would be working on keeping large industrial facilities working, specifically hydropower dams.

Arguments for staying:

1. I'm just now getting my feet wet, and I don't want to be ""flighty"" and end up not being able to build up any sort of expert knowledge in my field.

2. While the projects I get are small, there's still potential for me to do my own design work, rather than contracting it out. I have the impression that ACE is much more likely to contract out anything and everything, so I'd stick strictly to contract management type activities, and get very little technical experience.

3. I know they I like my coworkers and office atmosphere. I may or may not have the same experience at a new agency. 

Other factors/information:

1. The pay and opportunity for promotion are the same, though with the commuting change that probably actually counts as a modest pay raise.

2. My wife doesn't like how much I travel now, but is worried I might end up traveling more for ACE. I think the likelihood of that happening is somewhat low, but it's a reasonable concern and I could be wrong.

So I'm thinking that it can't hurt to apply, but I also don't want to waste anyone's time if I don't have to. And even if I do apply I'll still probably be ambivalent about whether or not to seriously pursue the opportunity should I get chosen to interview or even selected, so it'd be good to have some insight from fellow engineers on what to think about and how important some of my points really are. I'm all ears. ",AskEngineers,False,Hologram22,/r/AskEngineers/comments/b8lrkm/career_advice_for_young_already_employed/
59,Injection molding: how do they make this?,1554223629,"Hey my fellow designers. I've been looking at some teardowns lately, and I've been wondering how they make perorated tubes in plastics. I can't really believe they would use a slider for every perforated segment of the cilinder. Here are some examples to look at:

https://imgur.com/a/3yYjKaD

In the dye tubes example, I can see some stretched out holes, a sign that pins were used parallel with the mould halves.

In the example of the home pod, if you zoom in on the ribs, you can see a tiny line, maybe indicating a slider? But that would be weird, it almost seems like they have around 100 sliders used then...

Finally in the amazon echo housing example, I literally have no idea. The housing is perfectly smooth so no indication of sliders. and the holes are not stretched, so pins used perpendicular to the surface? Maybe the holes are made afterwards, but thats not a scale friendly method. I'm guessing here and have no idea. Would like to know if someone has a better gues.

62,DC motor response to variable voltage?,1554221625,"I am working on a project that requires large rotational accelerations of a DC motor shaft from a varying PWM voltage input. The DC motor will drive a flywheel to induce a free torque on the motor-flywheel body when angular acceleration occurs. I purchased a [simple DC motor](https://www.pololu.com/product/2822) that is rated for 12V and 5A stall. According to the equation V = Ri + Li' + WM  (1)  described [here,](https://www.precisionmicrodrives.com/content/dc-motor-speed-voltage-and-torque-relationships/) the torque output (Mi) is dependent on the rotational velocity (back emf) and voltage applied. Based on this, the max torque possible occurs when  the motor/flywheel is initially spinning in one direction at max rotational velocity (V = Vmax) and the voltage applied is inverted (V = -Vmax) to make the motor accelerate in the opposite direction.

Assuming the armature inductance (L) is negligible, the max torque theoretically should be equal to 2 * Vmax * (M/R). 

I empirically found constants M and R to be 0.181 N*m/A and 2.754 Ohms respectively. I found R using the resistance of the motor during stall for different voltages applied (V/I). I found M using equation 1 above and applying different voltages and measuring the angular velocity at a steady state.

Assuming a voltage input of 12V, the max torque should be roughly 0.788 Nm, but I have found that the max torque is closer to 0.15 Nm and is delayed (~0.07 sec) from the change in voltage.

What can explain this delay and the motor not reaching its theoretical maximum torque for a change in voltage? Do I need to invest in a nicer motor? Should I invest in a torque-controlled motor?

If you're looking for engineers to interview for a school assignment or for your job hunt, this is the right place! The AskEngineers community has compiled a list of hundreds of practicing engineers across different countries, industries, and specializations to help answer your questions about what they do in their job, how they got there, and offer career advice to those that need it.

**Note:** Please be courteous when requesting an interview. Everyone on the list is doing it on a volunteer basis only, and they are not obligated to respond or help you. Our users reserve the right to deny any requests for interviews and/or personal information. Harassment will not be tolerated and will be reported to the authorities.

###How to use this list

1. `Ctrl + F` the engineering discipline, country (e.g. US, UK, Germany, etc.), or other criteria you're looking for looking for. If you need to be able to verify someone's identity, search for `Available for e-mail?: yes`

1. Parse through each search result and message up to 3 users that you think will be able to answer your questions. **DO NOT shotgun PMs to every user!** If you don't intend to interview everyone, don't waste their time by sending messages that you won't respond to later.

1. If the first few users don't respond within 24 hours, try messaging another user.

---

###Interested in conducting interviews?

By signing up, you're volunteering to let high school students, prospective engineers, and new graduates PM or e-mail you with interview questions. Typically with students it will be for a class assignment (i.e. Intro to Engineering), so questions will be about about work, how you got into engineering, ""do you have any advice for..."", etc. Think of yourself as a STEM Ambassador.

You will receive anywhere from 1-4 requests per month on average, with some surges in January, July, August, and December due to new and graduating students. While these lists usually have over 100 sign-ups and is set to contest mode, which prevents the same users from getting bombarded with requests, engineers in an in-demand discipline may get more requests than average.

####Requirements

1. **At minimum, you should have:**
  * a BS / B.Sc in engineering or engineering technology, or an equivalent amount of self-study, and;
  * at least 3 years of professional engineering experience

1. **Commit to answering at least two interview requests per month**. Don't list your information if you aren't willing to volunteer roughly ~2 hours per month to conduct interviews.

####How much time does it take?

The first interview you do will take about 1 hour, depending on how detailed you are. After that, most interviews will take &lt; 30 minutes because you can copy-paste answers for repeat or very similar questions. That said, please be sure to read every question carefully before using previously written answers.

####How do I sign up?

Copy the template below and post a top-level comment below. **Note:** ""Available for e-mail"" means you're OK with the interviewer sending you a personal e-mail to conduct the interview, usually for verification purposes. If you want to stick to reddit PM only, answer 'no' to this question.

**This is purely on a volunteer basis.** To opt out, delete your comment here below. Once deleted, you will no longer receive requests for interviews.

I graduated with a B.S. in engineering last spring and have been working as an engineer for almost a year. I recently had an idea of pursuing an MBA for further advancement in my career. I haven't looked into it much because I had very little experience in business and/or management, so I'm still not sure if it's the correct path for me. I'm thinking of doing an online program while working full-time, and most schools I've looked at require a few years of working experience in an industry. So I guess I still have time to figure out if an MBA is the right fit for me?!

0,Swing from IT to Engineering?,1554164041,"Hello! I currently work in IT as a network engineer. I got almost all the way through school before I realized that what I really love is designing and building systems that make the digital collide with the physical in extraordinary ways. I get to do this to some extent by designing networks that connect buildings together, but I often find myself wanting to execute on ideas I have about robotics, intelligent/contextual environmental systems, and radio networks at a lower-level (physical media and signal processing). 

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I absolutely love working with people, and my dream would be to develop ideas and execute on them; to create solutions that solve problems people experience in the real world. My question is, where should I start? I picked up IT by playing with computers on my own and learning the finer points in school. When I look at all there is in the field of engineering, the breadth of the concepts that fascinate me are overwhelming. Should I just start reading and experimenting? Do any of you know of/have a good framework for learning the basics/theoretical concepts? Should I just pick a problem and throw my spare time at solving it to learn as I go?

&amp;#x200B;

This may seem like a silly question, as I often have people ask me how to get started with IT and I give them direction similar to the questions I posed; it seems obvious to me because IT is so familiar.

9,Bottling issue: Liquid soap keeps leaking. Are there any basic rules I should know?,1554151381,"Hi there. Please excuse me if this is the incorrect subreddit to ask. We've been having trouble in our business with leaking detergent soap when distributing our product, so I'm trying to understand what is that we are doing wrong. I thought I'd ask engineers since that is what they do: be smart and solve silly human problems. So here is the story:

&amp;#x200B;

My family owns a business that makes food grade detergents that supply huge food and beverage companies (Corona, Coca Cola Mexico, Pepsi Mexico, etc.). The soap is really strong and biodegradable, so I used to give it to friends so they could clean their pipes and bongs thoroughly. Two years ago, a friend and I thought about commercializing it around Mexico as a pipe and bong cleaner (we are in the slow process of legalizing weed in the country). I have economy and finance in my background, my friend is a designer, so no clue whatsoever about how to bottle the soap appropriately, we basically just thought that closing the cap tight was good enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

The business has been slowly, but steadily growing and it has been insightful as of what to expect when branding a product. However, because we are small, we did not invest in huge machines, so the bottling and capping are done semi-manually. The soap is more liquid than a regular liquid soap (thickness is closer to water). We use a handheld electric bottle capper and a semi-automatic liquid filling machine to fill the PET bottles. We starting having an increasing amount of complaints about packages with many leaks, some where from the caps, some were broken bottles at the bottom. We decided to add liners that seal with the cap. This has proved not to work, or even worse? Anyway, we have been discussing the problem and here are some points that we think we might be making mistakes:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bottling manually** \- with humans in the equation, comes human error, which is larger than production defects when using a machine. Maybe investing in a machines is a good solution? What type of machine should we upgrade to? Is there a correct way of doing it manually? What details should we focus on?
2. **Bottle and cap** \- our bottle supplier continuously changes the flat cap for our bottles (so far there has been three different caps). What I think is different though, might be just the outside design. For the large bottle the supplier said that if we twist the cap too much the top would come out. For me that is a sign that the caps are not designed for the bottles and may be causing this problem. I also thought into changing the cap to a pump, but I am afraid that the leaks would only increase. Are the pumps better for liquid than flat caps? Vice versa? Should I buy other kind of liners and a machine to seal it?
3. **Material quality** \- I have no idea if our plastic is of good quality. It for sure feels more stiff than shampoo bottle, which I reckon makes it easier to break (more glass-like than soft plastic). I just know its PET, but it does not feel like the PET bottles for drinks either. Like I said, our soap is really liquid, so I was just wondering what type of material is best for handling liquids when shipping them around a huge country? 
4. **Packaging** \- this has been hard for us since we are trying be as ecological as possible. We've used plastic bags, paper bags, news paper, and biodegradable cheeto-looking fillings to hold the bottles tight in the boxes. Nothing has seemed to work. I was starting to think to box each bottle individually. Is there an optimal way to bottle and pack liquid products by reducing as much waste as possible?

&amp;#x200B;

We are in the process of restructuring the whole business, so we are trying to hear from as many points of view as possible. The goals is to have figured out the bottling and packaging so we can focus on marketing and distribution to grow the business properly. I know I made lots of questions, but if I could only finish up understanding one of them I would be extremely happy. Many thanks for reading this and again, sorry if I misplaced the post. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can see the bottles in our webpage (spanish): [https://www.donamary.mx/conoacutecela.html](https://www.donamary.mx/conoacutecela.html) (see image slideshow)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have a business bottling liquid soap and it keeps leaking in the box when sent in mail. Are there any basic rules I should know about bottling and capping to avoid this? Is a liquid pump more likely to leak to a flat cap? Is (semi)manually filling the bottles the problem? What type of PET is best for handling liquids when shipping them around a country?

23,Why the CNG cylinder valves are not considered as the potential ignition source?,1554120446,"Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking into some additional information on the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fire/explosion safety and stumbled upon a question that I can't quite put my finger on. The CNG fuel system of an Natural Gas Vehicle (NGV) usually has both a shut off solenoid valve and cylinder solenoid valve. However, wherever I looked it seems like any discussion of potential ignition sources in an NGV does not consider these as factor. Moreover, it feels like the solenoid nature of these valves is omitted whenever there is some sort of safety analysis involved.   


I am asking mainly because when we consider installations, such as CNG refueling stations, the stuff gets real and every single part that can be under voltage in the system is thoroughly analyzed. The hazardous zones are assigned, where the components must possess the minimum safety category to be installed. I might be mixing up terminology a bit, but if you had the experience of working with ATEX/NFPA52, you get the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here we have two worlds an NGV and an installation. In the first case a very limited set of standards (NGV 3.1 for example or its European cousin  ISO 15500) is applied. Nor do these standards say anything about preventing the potential ignition sources neither do they have any particular requirements for the valve's electric parts. These mostly contain tests proving the durability of said valves. In the second case we have a strong base of IEC standards that are a hell to read and a pain to prove they are followed.  

&amp;#x200B;

Where is the catch here? If you are to put the valve for CNG system into the installation it does not have any category assigned and hence cannot be used in Zone 2 for example, which, depending on the institution asked and methodology applied can be a bunch of fitting connections (because they are prone to leaking, apparently). When the same valve are back in the car, in a confined place of a trunk with the the same tubing and fittings they are suddenly completely okay an no one bothers to question them as long as they follow one of the NGV standards.  


I mean, I would understand if the opposite was the norm, where a vehicle is considered a potentially more hazardous area, due to a significant number of additional factors that can add to why things can go boom. I was unable to receive any answer to these questions other than ""Different laws""...  
Frankly, it feels like evasion of both industries from the fact that either manufacturers of the NGVs and their components are doing something, which would not be considered ""safe"" by the IEC standards or that they are ""safe"", but the institutions that check for the on-site explosion safety don't bother to take that fact into consideration if you put a CNG valve into an installation. Is there a technical reason for this whole situation, or is it just an administrative BS that consolidated over the years while the standards were being developed?

At the moment im working in one country on a system integrator company, which means every project is completely different in a different sector. One day we can be doing a production line to one company and next day a project to a completely different company. This is just an example. Recently i received a job offer from a different country / company to work for them as HVAC control engineer. So i would be working with PLC's anyways, its just the field is different. I'm really happy with the offer they made. Not only because the money but the training courses they will give.

25,Are PV solar projects simpler and easier than other energy sources?,1554111428,"Hello, Reddit engineers!

Nowadays, our energy is created by big structures - from power plants to wind turbines and dams. They are composed by several equipments and each requires proper dimensioning and planning to achieve the best implementation possible.

To join the race, we have the photovoltaic solar panels. Now, they have way less components and, on top of that, none of them is a moving parts (let's ignore the tracking systems for now). 
If we remove the connection to the grid components - which all of them have - the main concerns of PV are good dimensioned structures, proper inverters and cables.On an inexperienced point of view as I have, they seem very straight foward in terms of projecting, having problems in other areas, like bureaucracy.


Which leads me to the question:  Compared to other projects, are solar panels easier and simpler? Do their projects end up being a bit ""boring""  for an engineer? 

Any feedback or criticism is welcome. And apologies if I said something wrong, I would be glad to be corrected.

30,"How much effort should I put in school, if my short-term goal is only about the money?",1554095930,"Note: **I have personal life reasons as to why I really need the money as soon and as much as possible.**

Hello Engineers, I am seeking some clarity and suggestions on how much effort I really need to be putting in school. My **short term goal** after graduation is to get the highest paying salary/hourly possible including overtime. My **long term goal** is to work in humanitarian design particularly energy. 

However, I currently think that I am putting in more than enough effort needed at my really hard school. I have a year left in my BSME and my GPA is around 3.64-3.73 out of 4.0. I am actively getting involved into clubs, as well as research projects. By the end of this Summer, I will have had 3 internships and I still think I should do another internship next summer. 

But lately I’ve been seeing that a lot of this effort does not really matter, everyone roughly gets the same job, same salary. (Especially with some networking). 
Along with my short term goal in mind, I am starting to think that taking some B’s and C’s is fine and I should just stop caring as much. I also say that because I’m willing to do field engineering, which is high-paying and not as selective outside the oil and gas industry.

*Yes I’m aware that the harder I try in school, the easier it would be for me to get the job I want after graduation. But I still question how much effort is really necessary.*

tl;dr: What high-paying jobs can I look at? What really matters for me in school if I just want money?

I just wonder about these things. I have a power supply (12V/2A) supply, 1 solenoid valve (+12V/5W, operating current I=250mA) and 1 LED (operating current I=20mA).  So when solenoid valve is ON, is that mean I still have the remaining 1.750A to turn on the LED? So how to choose the resistor for the LED, is that just 12V/20mA=600 ohm?

42,"Reddit, I need help: About to graduate as an ME and I feel almost nothing but dread.",1554071194,"I'm 24, it's taken me 6 years to get to where I'm at and it's been a myriad of highs and lows (probably more lows in regards to the academia aspect - college was fun overall). 

So to sum up why I'm getting a degree in mechanical engineering, it's pretty simple.. there's a good market for engineers and they make a lot of money.. yeah, not the best reasons but it is a worthy degree no doubt. I always knew I wasn't the engineering type, much more interested in understanding people and their behavior or how we perceive life and why (I love that shit, although I've fallen away from it). I never excelled in technical courses but I'm smart enough to get by with a little bit of effort and that basically became my reasoning for going all the way - I started to view it as teaching me to problem solve and I liked that.. not the actual engineering solutions but that ability to break things down and understand the parts of a whole to avoid being overwhelmed by a complex problem. I'd always reason, money creates opportunity and engineer's make money, so I can eat shit for 5 years or so and hopefully make my own path afterwards but reading job description after job description of things I can hardly stand for a few hours.. how can I do that? I'm not totally pessimistic, I am motivated under certain circumstances. Passion is my ultimate driving force and that's how I try to present myself but it's far and few between in something I have little passion for. 

My capstone (senior project) has highlighted my disdain for engineering as far as I know it in school. Peer reviewing Mid-term presentations of other students' capstones gave me a quarter-life crisis... I sat their thinking to myself, ""how the fuck can I do this for the next several years.. I'm going straight to the military if I start contemplating suicide"". I know work isn't always going to be fun, I have the phrase, ""it's called work for a reason"" ingrained in my mind, but mind-numbing technical work is something I can't live for and as I mentioned above I need some sort of passion/purpose to be doing it.

I'm starting to ramble so let me ask for advice. What would you suggest a personable problem solver who feeds off passion do, are there any good jobs for someone graduating as an engineer like that? I'm sorry that's sort of vague, I just want to consider anything and everything, I'm very open-minded when it comes to opportunity. I have been looking into project engineering, sales engineering (only for a product I could believe in), and even business development representative (very little). Not that I knew anything about careers in high school but my main points of interest were always psychology and philosophy - I think I'm really good at reading social situations and clarifying what two people mean when they aren't understanding each other (I'm fairly sure I don't want to be an HR rep) but anything in the engineering realm with the need for skills like this would be good.

All advice welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Engineering (soon to be) graduate who doesn't want to be a technical engineer, is good with people, likes thinking about the bigger picture, and feeds off passion, looking for a career route that might not make my stomach turn or at the very least something that could be worth eating shit for.

44,What should I be asking for in equity for medical device design?,1554069375,"I am a mechanical engineering student about to graduate this semester, and have been actively looking in the job market.  I went for an interview last week for a ""medical device design engineer"" position where the physician explained that he has an idea, and wants to design, test, and bring to market some sort of medical sanitation device.  He could not describe the details of his idea, but said it should be a relatively simple design that should have significant value in the field and should sell well.  

&amp;#x200B;

He explained that he was looking for someone young with a fresh mind and hopefully new ideas for the industry.  He said that it would not necessarily be a salaried position, as he did not expect me to have to work full time on it, and that he would rather have me take stake in the product in the form of equity.  It did sound like he was willing to negotiate living expenses and such in the case that I worked only on this full time, but it was somewhat vague.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing as I am just now graduating and had primarily been looking at full time positions where I am working in an office, I did not expect to have to present an offer for equity.  I am to call him back this upcoming week with an offer, but I do not know where to begin on how much I should value my time and work with this sort of thing.  The task itself is somewhat imposing, but I am trying to remain confident on that front that given the time and effort I could do it.  But before I get there, I have to present an offer for how much I want in equity, pay, and funds for startup (computer, CAD software, prototyping tools and equipment, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for advice from anybody in the product design field on how to make an offer, and perhaps career advice on whether or not to even accept this job as my first.  My head is humming with ideas, as I could feasibly pursue a master's degree if it requires as little time as he is suggesting (his idea) or even try working elsewhere and do this on the side.  Would it be wise to present two offers on each end of the pay : equity ratio spectrum?  Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated, including finer details about the business side of equity and share holding.

I still am trying to decide if I'm more interested in design, or test/quality engineering but haven't really done much design since probably 2016 in school.

Any advice on skills, cities to look for jobs/sites or agencies better than the generic job sites would be very helpful.

65,Under what conditions will high pressure air push water through an open tube vs. pass through the water as air bubbles?,1554046242,"I've been wondering about for the past few days and can't seem to find a solid answer. In the setup shown [here](https://imgur.com/rW2eJ33), I have a tube with an open end containing a column of water, and air under pressure behind a valve on the other side. The valve is opened and the high pressure air is pushed towards the water in the channel. I want the air to drive out the water (as a relatively singular unit) through the open end of the channel, but it seems just as likely that the air would simply pass through the water as bubbles.

My overarching question is : what conditions promote one behavior vs. the other? Are their equations that I can reference for light fluids doing work on heavier fluids while maintaining an intact boundary layer?

68,Safety for 17.5 foot swing set beam,1554033265,"Hello and thank you for reading this: I'm a nuclear engineer, but I don't have the slightest clue when it comes to modulus/inertia/etc and haven't done a mechanics of deformable bodies problem for about 10 years. Bottom line: I want this beam with no breaks or supports in the middle. I'd rather have someone say it can't be done safely than tell me how dumb I am for attempting this. Questions at bottom, but main concern is; is this safe?

- 6x6 posts on both ends 
- main posts have a gap of 16'8"" between them 
- each side has another 6x6 post for support (all dug down 3.5 feet in 10"" concrete columns 

My plan for now without many details: 
- two 2x12s sandwiched around 6x6 chunks every 2-3 feet
- three swings between: one adult, one toddler, and one dual toddler 

Detailed plan (skip if it wouldn't matter): 
- posts will each have two 2x12 secured horizontally 11.5"" below the top; one on either side, coming out about 2'
- rest one 16' 2x12s on top of each, flush with the top of each post
- join short 2x12s to long 2x12s and bolt sides together with 6x6 
- place a 2x6 spacer on the top 11.5"" of either side of both posts
- run four 5' length 2x12 from the tops of both sides of the posts down the two 16' lengths 
- place a 6x6x6"" block between the beams every 2-3 feet for horizontal movement while swinging 
- use these blocks to bolt swings to

More about the posts if you need to know:
- the top will be 9' ... Swings at 8' 
- one post is supported with the playground platform at 5' high with another 6x6 post about 5' away (and railing 2x4 at 8' high)
- other post is supported by diagonal 6x6 only 1.5' from post. I can secure this low or high; I was considering making them parallel and securing at the tops of each, but not sure yet. Massive conjoined holes, so maybe some rebar in there

Q1: does this sandwich approach work (2x12 on either side of 6x6 posts with blocks between)?

Q2: would it be better to place a 2x6 the length of the 2x12s (sideways I-beam). Assuming I will take care of waterproofing it with a drainage system on top.

Q3: what if I boxed the whole thing in? 2x6 at the top and the bottom. I can't imagine that thing moving, sagging, or deflecting at all. My only issue would be how I secure the sides to the posts since it's a nearly 17' span with 16' beam. See again above how I intend to do this. 

If you've made it this far, I sincerely appreciate it. There is almost nothing online that a layman can understand about beam length. Is this a go or no go? Thanks a ton!!

77,how to negotiate start up offer vs regular company offer?,1554007781,"I have about 5 years work experience and B.S. and M.S. so I  finally feel like I'm getting calls back from jobs that really interest me.

I have an offer from one company, large and well established in its industry. I would be on the test engineering team designing boards to interface chips with test equipment and testing chips. It sounds interesting in that they do a variety of small boards for different physical tests like vibration, acceleration etc. They made a solid offer, base salary 10K more than I make now, a small signing bonus, and an RSU grant paid out over 3 years. They also seem to have great benefits, 401k matching etc. I consider this a good offer and a safe job, but I'm not particularly interested in the industry, I would mostly be trying to enjoy the design work but not caring about the company overall.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also expecting an offer from a start up that recently received a second round of seed funding. It is a niche industry and I consider this a dream job. I believe I would be one of the first 10 or 15 employees hired. I would work remote (everyone else is too). There is definitely risk here, but even if the company ran out of money in 2 years I believe I would gain valuable design experience and get to check working in this industry and working at a start up off my bucket list.

My main question is what to expect and how to negotiate the start up offer? I don't even know if they would have health benefits etc (I could go on my wife's benefits though).

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently admitted by Colorado School of Mines with 35k in aid and admitted into their Thorson's Honors program. It is a dream school of mines, however, I would have to pay around 20-24k of my tuition and fees with loans. This would be mean I would be 80-100k in debt for when I graduate. I frequently see Mines being an amazing school with amazing starting salaries as well. Mines is a dream school for me and I would love to attend there! 

However, the debt frightens me to death and I've seen many people say not to go that much in debt.

My other two options are New Mexico Tech for petroleum engineering which would cost around 35k for the four years, and UC Riverside for chemical engineering which would cost around 25k for the four years as well. I've heard NMT is alright, but I'm certain I would hate it there. UCR isn't a bad shout but it's ChemE and I know their starting salary isn't the greatest (I think it's around 60-ish thousand).

93,How do you adapt from school to the workplace?,1553982186,"Even though it was a lot of work, I really enjoyed getting my bachelors (EE major, CS minor). Each class was self-contained, the material from the current week built on what I learned last week, there was always a right answer + process to get there, and the teacher or TA knew both of them and were always willing to help. That's not to say I was a 4.0 student (my gpa was 3.3 at graduation), but I always felt ""in my depth"" and capable of broadly learning whatever material was thrown at me.

Imagine my surprise when actual engineering jobs are nothing at all like that. I had 3 summer internships and have been working full time for a year and change now. At all of them I've felt useless, either unable to apply the knowledge I already knew, drowning in the amount of knowledge I didn't know (while trying to learn it), and often unable to communicate effectively (both in not understanding when other patient engineers explain things to me, and not being able to appropriately articulate my thoughts when trying to explain my confusion to them). I know this isn't just ""imposter syndrome"" since I've seen other interns/other friends excel and surpass me at their jobs, even as many of them were far less successful in school.

In all my jobs, my favorite tasks have been what would rightly be called gruntwork, whether assembling or testing board enclosures. I really enjoyed the feeling of knowing exactly what I was supposed to be doing and how to do it. During my internships with larger companies, I remember envying non technical employees and IT and wishing I could just do what they do instead.

This has been especially bad at my first full time job, as the company is quite small, and prior to my hiring one engineer basically did all of the technical work. He's still a pretty young guy (late 30's at most) and yet knows so much and basically built the companies products from the ground up. Whenever I get assigned design projects it feels like he's basically doing it for me, as my initial designs (which often feel more like guessing than real design work) are so completely far off the mark.

Is this just how real engineering jobs are for the first five years? I really hope not because it makes me pretty miserable. Should I be looking into another industry? Go to grad school to put off the real world for a few years? Switch gears to software development and then get laid off in 10 years when there are way too many of them?

7,Is there a guideline or resource for figuring out how to assign tolerances?,1553957296,"I feel like this is something I should have learned but never did. When I'm designing something, how am I supposed to decide what an appropriate tolerance is? Is there some sort of standard guideline or table or method I can use? I always feel like an idiot whenever I go to the machine shop because this is the first thing they ask about, and I'm never sure how to answer.

Like suppose I want to bolt two pieces together with two bolts and have the bolts be an inch apart from each other. I know I can look up what the bolt hole size needs to be and select the proper drill size to make that hole and there's not much I can do to affect the tolerance on the hole size (other than using different drill sizes for tight or free fits).

But for the distance between the two bolts, what do I set that tolerance as? In this particular case, I don't much care whether the bolts are exactly 1in apart, just that the holes line up with each other and hold the parts together. I guess in general I'm supposed to decide how much margin is acceptable in each dimension. I'm not making a ton of the same parts here, so I don't really care about the statistics side of this at all. But I have no idea how to answer the question ""How far out of alignment is OK for two holes with a bolt running through them?"" or how to do so in an ""engineer-y"" way. 

This is especially confusing as there's some amount of ""tolerance"" that also then just a design choice. Like if I've got a mounting plate and it doesn't matter if it's 3/8in or 1/2in or even 1in thick, it will still do the job. But it seems really weird to put ""3/4 +- 0.25in"" on a drawing. It just seems way too big. Or if I have two pieces that need to match in a specific way (like hole patterns) but the specifics of that is up in the air (doesn't matter if the holes are 1in or 1.5in apart).

Last thought is on repeatability. By that I mean, if I loosen the bolts, jiggle it around, and re-tighten them, how far will the parts have moved from each other? I imagine that this would effect not just the design (fit level for the holes) but also the tolerance. Is this something I can design for?

I don't know if I've done this intentionally or whether it's just been due to my circumstances but I've slowly been transitioning to more data heavy roles over my last few jobs.

I am a frequent lurker on reddit and decided to make an account so that I can raise some concerns I have as I begin my career. If anyone can spare some time to offer me some advice or some of their thoughts, I would greatly appreciate it!

**Background:** I will be graduating with a BSME from a state school in May. I transferred from a local CC, where I took many of my Freshman and Sophomore courses but feel I didn't get that great of a foundation in some of the early classes (CAD and Materials of Engineering, most notably). Luckily, I have done well in school overall and will be graduating with a 3.5 cumulative GPA and a 3.7 Major GPA. I have had two years worth of internships in the Aerospace Industry and I have 4 years of previous construction experience. Fortunately, this has helped me land a career in a fantastic city making a comfortable wage for a large Aerospace Defense company. I am not the smartest kid in many of my classes, but I really enjoy working hard and accomplishing goals which is what has kept me driven throughout school. I am absolutely thrilled, but I don't want to blow it.

**Concerns:** I've accepted an *awesome* position doing something that truly interests me, in a industry that I find fascinating - but I can't help but feel under-qualified. I will be beginning my career as a Stress Analyst and Design Engineer (rotational program). Both giving me the opportunity to head down the technical road that I hope to be in for the entirety of my career. I cannot, however, imagine what types of things will be expected of me when I begin and I frequently worry that I will not be up to par with the standards of the position. My biggest fear is that I've only mastered how to test take in college and not truly mastered the material.

**Questions:**

**As a Stress and Design Engineer, what do you believe I should be proficient in by my start date? What do you believe I should know, that could help make my team or manager's life easier?**

**What can a green Engineer do to really make an impact early on?**

**What is one piece of career advice that you could offer me based on your own experience?**

**When/How did you gain some confidence in your abilities as an Engineer?**

27,Should I continue studying mechanical engineering?,1553910853,"Hello, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to read my post, as it is quite a long one.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a 25 year old full-time community college  student in the U.S. studying mechanical engineering.  About a year ago or so, I debated switching into computer science, but ultimately decided to continue pursuing an engineering degree while studying programming on my own.  For the record, I had made several posts in regards to ""mechanical engineering vs computer science"" here on Reddit and the majority of advice I received suggested that I stay in my mechanical engineering program and self-study programming, which I have done thus far.

&amp;#x200B;

As of late, I have begun to have the thought that perhaps I don't actually want to be engineer.  I originally decided to study mechanical engineering so that I could pursue a career in spaceflight (my intended transfer institution does not offer aerospace engineering).  However, it had never occurred to me just how narrow of a career path that really is.  Additionally, as I am a bit older, I would really like to start making money as soon as possible, so I'm not sure whether I would be comfortable immediately pursuing a graduate degree, which seems to be essentially required to work on spacecraft.  

&amp;#x200B;

From the moderate amount of research I have done, it seems like many jobs that are attainable with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering are jobs that I would be miserable in.  While I enjoy mechanical things such as cars (I perform work on my personal vehicle), motorcycles, and other things of that nature, I have absolutely no desire at this point in time to do mechanical design.  I have taken one class so far that involved CAD, and I could not stand it.  Pouring over technical drawings and schematics sounds like an unusual form of torture.  Writing technical reports, updating Excel spreadsheets, putting together Powerpoints, or calling distributors so see when materials are being shipped sounds like a living nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I am interested in related to mechanical engineering would be experimental propulsion systems, spacecraft guidance/navigation, space mission planning, orbital research/analysis/simulation, general space exploration, and even new types of prosthetic limbs or body parts.  Additionally, I LOVE interacting with people and have extremely good people skills, and think I could see myself as someone who frequently interacts with clients and other folks - perhaps a project manager or sales engineer?

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned previously, I have done some self-studying of computer science. I am slowly working my way through MIT's Intro. to Computer Science with Python, and I'm really enjoying it.  I really like the ""puzzle"" aspect of programming, and I find it extremely satisfying to get a program to run correctly.  

&amp;#x200B;

This all leads up to the revival of my inner debate of switching my major to computer science.  Switching into CS would put me back a semester, and because the senior design projects at my intended transfer university only start in the fall, this would effectively delay my graduation by one year, so I would graduate when I'm roughly 29 instead of 28 (I am almost 26 currently).  Additionally, I could switch into CS and end up hating it, which would really suck, big time.

&amp;#x200B;

The majority of my hang-up stems from the fact that I have become less focused on specific career goals, and more worried about making enough money to do the things I want to do in life.  My absolute #1 life goal is to travel the world, and as I am sure many of you know, international travel can be quite expensive.  From what I have been reading, it seems that computer science graduates earn higher salaries ON AVERAGE than mechanical engineering graduates, adjusting for geographic location.  Additionally, because I enjoy programming and studying computer science concepts (so far), and I would be almost guaranteed employment that involves programming with a CS degree, it seems a little more ""safe"" than studying mechanical engineering but not being guaranteed to work on spacecraft.

&amp;#x200B;

I also recognize that with continued self-study of computer science, I can pursue software jobs even with a MechE degree. I would just have a leg down against CS graduates.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am not expecting Reddit to answer my personal life questions, but any input, advice, or anecdotes you can offer me would be much appreciated, as this has really has me stressing out as of late.

**TLDR**

**I own a solar Engineering, Procurement and Commissioning Company and I would like to know how to present my work professionally in my CV/Portfolio if I were to move to different country for job.** 

&amp;#x200B;

(2011-2015)Basically, I am from India and I was very poor growing and also handicapped technology wise (No phone, laptop, internet until 2011). Took up engineering because, I was good with numbers and really handy with tools. Studied mechanical engineering, was really good with grades but had a hard time finding ""paying"" internships. So, I was taking up odd jobs and what not to save up some money. 

&amp;#x200B;

(2015-2017) I moved to Sweden with my then GF (she was swedish) and continued to study Masters in Sweden whilst working for a vehicle startup. Really, didn't know anything nor could I learn anything at the start up because it was a start up and I wasn't prepared. I studied mostly TQM, TPM and Product Development and Design from Sweden.   


(2017-2018) After, graduation I was desperate for a job and in the end I decided to come back to India after I failed to get any reliable job opportunities in Sweden (PR/Visa sponsorship) and started my own company. A company in which I mostly design, procure and install solar panels for most part of the revenue. As an engineer, I mostly only use Machine Design, bolts, rivets, CFD, FEA and Metallurgy from what I learned from Engineering school. Since, I was very reserved with my company expenses, I personally took care of Marketing (running online low key ads, Logo Making, Website designing, Brochures, and posters), sales pitches, installation and maintenance.   


(2018) Mostly only taking up small scale OFF-Grid projects, helping farmers and small industries. Within a month or two I started getting residential projects and from there it blew up into 500kW + projects in less than 10 months. Once, I started getting residential projects I hired few guys to help me out, I mostly monitor and/or work along side them these days. Since I started to find some office time thanks to extra help I hired, I picked up some interior designing hobbies and learned how to design lighting (IES modelling and VR visualization to dazzle the customers, some sort of exotic marketing trick if you will) for indoors, I do them as a side project only.

&amp;#x200B;

(2019) I make enough money now and little more thankfully. But, I am not happy as an engineer. Once I came to reddit asking for help and I was seriously criticized for not being able to convey or explain what I needed through the post, I agree about that but it did hurt me a bit. Truth is I haven't spend any time at an engineering firm to learn to talk like one. I mostly hire un-skilled labor and do sales with non-engineering folks mostly. I do get tenders and project quotes from engineering firms but then again dialogue isn't that elaborate.   


From what's going on right, I get to have fun and I can't afford to drop this company and take another job for another year. From some research I have learned that I do mostly project engineering kind of work these days. I would like to become better at it and prepare myself for the future (learn how to present my current work as a professional project eningeer's portfolio). Also, I would like to move to New Zealand with my girl friend after her clerkship, who is a doctor and has had enough of the sexual harassment at her work place which apparently is a thing in some hospitals in India. So, if Reddit has any advice for engineers to look impressive to New Zealand employers please feel free to advice.

I've seen some videos on youtube and read a little bit online about what is the best way of connecting 2 wires but everyone seems to have a different opinion on what's best. So as far as I know the area of contact between 2 surfaces depends on a few things like the force applied, the hardness of the material and Prandtl's number (at least that's what I managed to find online).

Now the most common methods from what I heard are soldering and using connectors (like wago terminals). Soldering kinda makes sense if I think about the factors I mentioned above since solder has a lower hardness than copper but I've seen a video of someone comparing 2 wires 1 connected by wago terminals and the other one by soldering (wires were same length) and the wire connected with wago terminals had significantly lower resistance (the soldered one had about 4 Ohms while the wago connected one had about 0.4 Ohms).

46,"Currently studying Automotive engineering, is a concentration in aeronautics worth it? or should I stick with Automotive projects?",1553880035,"Hi reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently an 7th semester (out of 9) student of Automotive Design and Engineering in a very good university here in Mexico. Since the beginning of the semester i've been looking for some professional development opportunities and came across the chance of doing a concentration in aeronatical engineering which gives me an extra certificate besides my degree, we can consider a minor degree in terms of US education I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Said concentration program gives me the advantage of taking 3 semesters worth of courses in just a semester, however that definitely means of a lot of hard work and dedication, I even need to go to another city within the country. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the same program I'm applying for gives me the opportunity to work along with Volkswagen of Mexico in the development of the new Tarek concept. This would also give me a certificate however in the automotive field and makes me think it's a great experience that not that many people get to live. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stuck taking a decision, its either experience in my Major field or experience in a field that can complement my Major. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given your experience in your proper field, is it worth it for an automotive engineer to take such courses in aeronautics? wouldn't big companies prefer a proper aeronautical engineer over an automotive engineer?  Should I consider staying on my field and gain experience? On the long run I expect to work for one of the principal automotive brands or the aerospace field in one of it's principal companies, I have no strict preference for either of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps, I was an FRC robotics team member and now I'm enrolled in my school's SAE Baja team.  I've always looked forward in acquiring valuable experience for my professional future.

I graduated almost a year ago, and I left my internship about 8 months ago. The short and sweet explanation on the reasoning is depression. I've been a socially awkward guy my whole life but I've been working very hard on acknowledging my awkwardness and trying to be as normal as possible. My interviews didn't go so well due to this and I fell into a depression and that's when I left my internship. I've gotten 4 interviews, 1 for very low salary, 1 from the company I worked at, and 2 contract to hire positions. I bombed the first 3 but I improved with each one and finally gave a normal interview on my last one, but it still wasn't enough. I remained untreated for a while but I've got it under control now and I'm really eager to get back to work. I worked really hard throughout college to get a decent GPA while working the entire time and I don't want it to go to waste.

I am located in Detroit, MI and I'd really like to work in automotive engineering.

84,Mech E Career Advice,1553820649,"Hey guys I am a long time lurker (obviously this is a throw away account) first time poster. I have recently been going through a difficult time in my life (career wise and personally). I want a reality check/ unbias opinion of strangers.  I will be rambling as thoughts pop into my head. I wrote this on my phone without ample tine to proof read. Grammar Nazi be kind.

Brief History
I graduated from a D1 school in the Midwest (Mechanical Engineering). My gpa wasn’t steller (3.2 to be exact). Throughout my collage/ high school schooling, there were situations in my life where I suffered from extreme anxiety. For example, my parents had to profusely beg me to attend both my high school and college graduation. During my college graduation, it was so bad that my doctor prescribed a mild dosage of anxiety meds to help. Honestly I don’t think it did much because I felt completely disassociated from my body, when I made the walk. I felt like I was in a third person view watching myself walk. I had a healthy amount of friends during my college and high school years. I’ve probably lost a few due to my lack of investment in friendships. This is purely my fault.
 In my opinion I think I made it through school purely on grit and determination. I never placed anything above studying. I spent many hours at the Ta’s office and Office hours, when offered. The schooling system was familiar to me and I knew what I needed to do to get the grade that I wanted. The reason I was so motivated is because I was raised by a single parent. And I watched as (he/she) slave and toil to make ends meet. This drove me to attempt to at least become part of the middle class. At this point in my live getting a degree was the end goal. Shortly after this reality set in.

Work History
After 3 months of countless failed interviews and rejection. I got my first career job (Midsize engineering company). In hindsight I was blubbering mess for at least 90% of my interviews. Finally, I am part of the corporate world. This was one of the happiest day of my life. Soon after I started suffering from imposter syndrome. This caused me great anxiety and stress (I don’t handle stress very well).
I had no idea how to navigate it this new life change. This force me to come up with my own philosophy. I decided to keep my work and personal life separate. This means I hardy interacted with coworker outside of work. Also my small talk game is terrible. At this point in my life I suffered from the need of approval. After working for some period I became extremely unhappy. Living to work wasn’t glamorous. I didn’t like the small town I was in. I didn’t want to spend a huge portion of my youth living in the same state. So I impulsively (filled with emotion) quit my job without 2 weeks’ notice (I know I know) and moved to a bigger city.
	After months of bombing interviews and an unhealthy amount of depression I got a job (small engineering company) in a different industry. As usual I was extremely terrified when I started. I was extremely awkward/ panicky during site visits and lunch and learn. I also got sketch out when people watched me work. During this early period one of my coworker that left the company warned me about our toxic manager and his hand in decisions previous employees made to no longer be with the company. Soon after some changes were made. Said person was demoted and I wasn’t requested to go on any site visit. 
During my recent employment I was never reprehended or instructed to be better at my job. Fast forward a few more months. I came in completed a project before the deadline. My boss promptly invited me to the conference room and let me go without a reason. The next day I came in and requested for reason. Shortly after I sat with the principal engineer and hr to discuss these claims. Below is their reason for termination and my rebuttal.

Reasons given by xxx engineering for my termination and my rebuttal.

1.	It appeared to be difficult for you to apply situations to your drawings after a clear explanation from xxx the principal engineer 

a.	When I spoke to xxx about this remark he had a difficult time coming up with a situation. His only remake was a situation where the contractor wanted a certain diffuser (during a phone conversation we both attended) and I missed that detail on my drawings. He also handed me redlines which showed the diffuser that I drew. I am still perplexed by this remark.

2.	The questions you were asking the other engineers lacked common knowledge of the construction field, which made it cumbersome for the other engineers.

a.	When I applied for this position my resume never stated that I had construction experience. xxx has preached to us numerous times on how he loves to bring in new engineers and train them in the industry. The guy that got hired prior to my termination worked in real estate prior to his employment. To add more background to my answer, we often have to take over projects from former employees. What I have witness form my coworkers during this time is the iteration that the individual wasn’t following the companies procedure, they didn’t know what they were doing, the mistake they made could’ve be avoided if they asked a question,  etc. I didn’t want to be associated with that conversation so I asked question and sought help from whoever is willing to help. I wanted to put out the best drawing possible with minimal mistakes. If I would’ve made assumptions and not seek help, it would’ve cost xxx (the company) more money in the long run. All of our drawings are reviewed by the city. Comments and redlines made by the city has to be addressed by xxx at a no cost to the customer. Again I would like to iterate that I’ve been in this industry for less than 7 months. My intentions were genuine even though it appeared bothersome.

3.	There were great difficulties for you in the design build

a.	The nature of some jobs done by xxx lack the necessary information needed this requires assumptions to be made. According to good engineering practice some assumptions can be made and some can’t. This is where my struggle lies. This prompted me to seek help from the senior engineers willing to help. I would also like to state that I have never missed a deadline and my questions would have decrease with experience.

4.	There were difficulties applying knowledge/ experience from one project to the next, the questions were repetitive in nature.

a.	Again no specific example was provided to me on this topic. Due to my experience level in this industry I can only rely on the past projects that I’ve worked on and the go-by provided to me to assist me with future projects. Again I am really perplexed by this statement. The statement “The questions were repetitive in nature” is not accurate. Depending on who I seek help from in xxx, some individuals tell you do something because I said so. Grant it. They are usually right. But, if the concept wasn’t explained to me my questions might appear repetitive in nature. If this was an issue why wasn’t a training session prompted?  

5.	There was a lack of listening to the suggestions on the “how to”

a.	Again no specific example was given to me. I never received a similar review from the contractors and customers that personally dealt with me.

6.	There was a lack of taking notes to refer to on current project.

a.	MEP design is extremely situational. The only notes that I needed to take were equations and formula when needed. This can be easily found on the internet or the company server. After a few months in, I obtained an equation book. I believe this is a judgment on personal preference. 

In addition while speaking to xxx about the issues addressed he offered me a part time position and a recommendation letter. If all those statements were true why would he offer this to me? I found this whole ordeal abrupt and confusing.

Recently I am back to square one and applying for jobs. This is where my advice/ questions lie.

On a scale of 1-10 is my career recoverable?

Should I leave my past employer off my resume? I am considering this based on the fact that I’ve had some great interviews without optimal results. One employer interviewed me for an engr position, but offered an internship with hopes of full time position. Another employer offered a contract non engr position. Both of these roles were listed as engr positions.

I looks like the universe is telling me that I need to work for myself. Strongly considering website design, dropshipping, collaborating with a friend on an app idea (His snapchat followers is 200K and rising). In the mean time I will continue with my blue collar job.

Should I pursue a career in an non engr field?

This is a brief synopsis I am sure I forgot to state some things. I am basically writing this as thoughts pop into my head. Pardon my disorganized thought process. If you made it this far, thanks for reading this.

I'm really in need of some career advice. If you could also critique my resume I would really appreciate it!

I graduated almost a year ago, and I left my internship about 8 months ago. The short and sweet explanation on the reasoning is depression. I've been a socially awkward guy my whole life but I've been working very hard on acknowledging my awkwardness and trying to be as normal as possible. My interviews didn't go so well due to this and I fell into a depression and that's when I left my internship.

1,How to create a Control Room or Operations Room for a production facility?,1553793705,"# Background

I'm a biotech process engineer and I was surprised to learn there was no **control room** at our facility. 

By **control room**, I mean a central space for where equipment and processes can be monitored and/or controlled. Basically where you have immediate visual factory of any alarm conditions or processing bottlenecks and where operators, engineers, and maintenance personnel can interface to triage issues. 

Instead, all the engineers sit in a cubes 1/4 mile away from the production floor and wait for maintenance personnel to relay alarm conditions. Communication channels aren't well defined and no real protocols exist for responding to breakdowns. 

# My Proposal

I've slowly been developing a process overview using Plant Information (PI) by OSIsoft, which seems like a step in the right direction, but I'm unable to enlist support from anyone, including management, in pursuing the idea further. I was told that spending time on this is distracting me from fixing real issues. 

# Question

I have two blowers, one higher quality with slightly nicer fan that has slightly better static pressure and CF/M by the advertised specs, the other cheaper with similar but inferior ratings. Both are designed for purpose, but it seems prudent to combine the two rather than toss out one.

I plan to make a system with a cyclonic separator stage (or Thein baffle) followed by a filter stage. Since dust collection at tools is generally more about CF/M rather than static pressure, would it generally make more sense to put the fans in parallel, or because of the static pressure drop from a cyclonic separator put them in series. Would slightly dissimilar fans cause excess stress on one fan over the other?

We are using Kvaser Leaf Light dongles, and have made sure to get our terminating resistance right, but getting the sensor and Kvaser set up so that it will communicate with our sensors over CAN. We are currently working with a bosch radar, and have a .dbc file we can use for decoding and encoding CAN jargon, but we aren't able to talk to our sensor. Our Kvaser sees the CAN network (we think) but we aren't getting any messages from our sensor.

Is there anywhere I can go to troubleshoot this? We have the python-can library on our computer, but does anyone know of any links that can teach me and my team to use CAN interfaces in software? If at all possible I would like to stick to free/open-source software and libraries.

13,My electrical circuit is not working,1553787335,"Good day!

First of all, I am not an engineering student. The problem is that I have no knowledge about electricity. As in, I am too dumb for these things. The electrical circuit that I have made was purely for my Research Capstone class. I decided to make an electrical circuit since I have no other choices.

Here's the overview and the main problem:
The electrical circuit is composed of three batteries, wires, light switch, and 2-3V LED light.

1. Each of the batteries were opened and empty inside, except the carbon rod which is where the positive terminals are connected to. Each batteries were filled with human urine which proved useful since each of the empty batteries were able to generate at least 1V.

     1.1. Battery A (left) - 1.08V
     1.2. Battery B (middle) - 1.13V
     1.3. Battery C (right) - 1.18V

2. The wires have both positive and negative terminals connected to the positive and negative terminals of the batteries. You may understand more in the pictures.

3. The one side of the light switch have wires connected from the electrical circuit and to the LED light which one side is also connected from the electrical circuit.

The main problem is that even though altogether, there are 3.39V, the wires failed to connect the voltages and were only able to generate about 1V, which was not enough to light up the LED light.

So, the question is, how do I fix my electrical circuit? I have to make it work by the weekend or else, I'll fail. I tried everything as my first attempt was electrolysis but was unsuccessful as well. Please help me ASAP.

Cons:

* is useless - everything you need to know/learn will be taught to you through experience and field work (unless you want to become a college professor or conduct your own research)
* not worth the expense - entry level jobs will pay the same
* makes it harder to find a job - your knowledge set is now too specific and you're no longer ""malleable"" 

Pros:

* you gain a far greater understanding of the material - deeper than what you'll ever get out of undergrad or a job
* you'll receive more job offers and it puts you above other candidates for jobs

and the overall design I elaborate below 

I’m also having issues with the spring loaded bolt or latch that is installed in the frame I don’t know how I can make it so the bolt is pulled towards the wall into their sockets with the spring, nor do I know how I can make it so that when I pull one lever all the bolts are pulled out of their sockets so that the height can be adjusted 

As you can probably see in the diagrams of my link there are pulleys but I’m not sure if they will work or help I’d also like to know if it’s possible to have a roller blinds mechanism that can help bring it up or down

1 is the frame the primary structure which is where the bolt passes through into the wall

2 is the plywood top where all the object will rest books trophy’s gaming consoles lamps etc 

3 is the lever that’s connected via string to the pulley 

4 is the string wire beads or whatnot that are used for the pulleys

5 are the pulleys that are attached via string wire or whatnot, to the spring bolt that when pulled pulls the bolt out of its wall screw shelf socket when released the bolt snaps back into place 

6 are the spring bolts that go through the bottom part of the frame they them go into wall’s socket and are one of the main components of the shelf

So far I have taken intro math and physics courses and some other stuff (CAD, comp sci, etc) and i have been doing well in terms of grades.

My concern is just that I've never been a computer person, or a DIY kinda kid that tinkers with stuff, I just enjoy learned math and science, along with other things, sometimes including humanities. I'm not worried about engineering being ""too hard"", because that is something I can work on. I am more worried about if I will be happy as an adult with whatever job I end up with.

I came in with the idea of aerospace (bc space and planes are dope), but it seems many people want to go that route and I'm not sure if I can get the job I desire. I have been doing my school's DBF and I enjoy it, although many people seems to know way more than me in terms of technical aspects and it can be very intimidating at times.

I am also drawn to energy, such as wind turbines or marine energy, or really any kinds of application of engineering to the environment, however that makes me think I should be doing something like ChemE or environmental?

My plan is to drive the shoes attached to the rc cars and ignite the rocket travel my desired distance.

I am hoping to travel 1.38 meters in the air and a total of 15 feet distance. My car (with the shoes attached) goes 2.065 mph.  The rockets can reach an attitude of 83 meters in a 1lb rocket.

I want to control and plan how high I can make it it go and far. (Basically don’t just strap a rocket to a pair of shoes and set it off).I was thinking  of trying to cut the rocket engines into smaller sections and ingniting them to make them less powerful?

TLDR: Left a job I like for more money. Hate the new job. Got offered my old job back at the same time I had phone screen for an amazing opportunity. How can I buy time interviewing for new job before signing old offer?

So I left a job that I really enjoyed to take a new job with better pay (20k more, at market value) and less brutal travel requirements. Really quickly, I learned this new job is terrible for my career and I hate it here. I need out.

While looking for a new job, my old employer actually asked me back! They asked my requirements. I told them to match my salary, and less brutal travel requirements. We agreed on a week of travel a quarter. Then I didn't hear any followup from them. I know from my friend whose still there that they interviewed more people, and they kept the job posted for about a month.

So today I had a phone screen with a job that sounds amazing. Now a phone screen is no guarantee, and interview process could take weeks. But as soon as I hung up, I got a voicemail from my old employer saying that they're ready to have a ""serious conversation"". What the hell?

So my question is: How can I string my old employer along to buy myself enough time to see if this new job pans out? I don't want to burn my old bridge, but the potential new job would be a dream?

59,Digital motion processing help question (from a Neuroscientist),1553710714,"Hi all,

I'm posting here on the advice of r/diydrones, who said you're the people to ask. I'm hoping you might be able to help out with a problem i've come across in my research?

I'm a Neuroscientist working on spatial cognition. Broadly, i'm looking to find out exactly how the brain represents the space around us, our position in it, and how we move through it. This should lead to a better understanding of diseases in which these processes are affected, such as Alzheimer's, and show us novel ways of treating it. To do this, I use mice and rats, trained to perform spatial tasks, such as navigating mazes.

Specifically, i'm investigating head direction cells. These are neurons which encode the direction which we are facing at any given point, up and down, left or right, etc. I'm looking for a way to record the direction that a mouse or rat is facing in real-time. Systems already exist for recording this, but only in two dimensions, that is to say, they lack the ability to be able to record up/down head movement, or inversion of the animal. Additionally, as they rely on tracking small LEDs, these systems can't be used in complex 3D mazes, as the lights are not always visible.

I initially asked r/diydrones for suggestions of electronic methods of tracking head direction in 3D. The best suggestion appeared to be using the MPU-9250 as in this project: https://www.hackster.io/donowak/esp32-mpu9250-3d-orientation-visualisation-467dc1. 

There are two problems with this that i'm trying to work through. The first is physical. I need to implement this chip in a way which is minimally invasive for the rat/mouse. That means that whatever processor and power source i use needs to be as small and light as possible. Ideally, it would be wireless. Using wired power and data transmission is definitely workable, but does have limitations. 

The second problem is that I need to be able to synchronise the motion/direction data very closely to brain recordings which are being made simultaneously. Currently, this is fed as an analogue signal directly to a recording PC.

As someone with very limited coding and electrical engineering experience, the inclusion of any guide materials you know of along with any suggestions would be very well appreciated. 


Please do come forward with any comments, suggestions, or questions.

0,Comprehensive mathematical model for a steam locomotive's fuel consumption,1553647062,"I'm  a history buff and I've been doing a lot of reading about Sir Nigel Gresley, the engineer responsible for the design of the world's fastest steam locomotive, Mallard. In one of the books I read the author mentions that a lot of steam design principles had no real basis in mathematics and were just handed down from crafstman to craftsman over the years. It took men like Gresley and Chapelon to make steam locomotive design scientifically rigorous. To this end they developed models (I may be misusing the term model, but they were sets of equations, etc.) that could encompass the entire operation of the locomotive. However, for the life of me, I cannot find these models anywhere and they may well have been lost to history.  I have found the formulas for calculating tractive effort, time to accelerate to a given speed, braking distance and the like but for the life of me I cannot find anything for fuel consumption (coal and water) and steam/production and consumption. What I'm looking for is something along these lines: *for a locomotive producing x lbf of tractive effort, with a fire in the firebox of y temperature, and steam at a given temperature and pressure, how much steam is used in a given stroke of the piston (cylinder volume is known) and how much coal and water is required to make up for that expenditure of steam to keep the steam pressure constant?*

I want to know this because surely it is something that Gresley and his associates had figured out, and it galls me to think it's now nowhere to be found, at least on the internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, does anybody know how one might calculate the steam generation rate for a locomotive boiler?

* I haven't heard back from engineering companies that I've applied to since September, and I've kept applying since then. I even expanded my search to cover most of the US. I have one friend actively send out resumes in his company (a Defense contractor), and another let me use him as a referral for another Defense contractor. I've actively applied to both companies but had no luck. 
* I have heard back from smaller companies, but these positions are NOT engineering jobs nor are they even remotely good enough pay to live in the area. The most engineering-like job that I'm currently being interviewed for is a combustion systems technician job. I'd be calibrating, reviewing, troubleshooting, and documenting combustion systems, as well as reviewing PLC, SCADA, and process control systems. These are all buzzwords for energy companies and utilities that are looking to hire engineers, which is something that I'd like to do. But... it's still technician work under a technician title. 
* My part-time paid internship, while the experience has been good to put on a resume, is not something I want to turn into a full-time job. Management is disorganized and disrespectful to its interns (3 have already quit and started working the same time I started working there), and their pay is at minimum wage. 

What I'd want:

* I'd like to get a job/offer ASAP, but can wait til June. By then my internship would be 6 months in, and I'd much rather quit than continue to work there. 

r/AskEngineers, what should I expect moving forward? Should I take the technician job if offered or grit my teeth, keep my internship, and continue applying?

7,"Interested in focusing my major, but I don’t know what suits my interests best.",1553642038,"Hello, I am a second year university student working towards a degree in multidisciplinary engineering. Next fall I will start a two year capstone project that I can tailor towards my personal interests/career aspirations, as it will be the focus of any job interview leaving college. 

When I first came to school, I was dead set on pursuing my interests and passions in environmental engineering. However, as I have been exposed to different aspects of engineering and developed skills, I find myself lost on where to go from here. 

As I start to plan a proposal for my project, I have so many ideas and I can’t settle on what to work on. I still have deep interests in environmental engineering, specifically stormwater and soil. I also am fascinated with designing products, CAD modeling, and 3D printing (having just bought my first printer a few months back). 

My issue is that I haven’t seen much cross over in my interest towards designing and ideation and the aspects of environmental engineering I am passionate about. 

Are there fields and careers for those interested in problem solving and designing products? Is there any cross over between that and environmental systems/issues? It is possible I haven’t reached courses that will expose me to these things, but I would like to know so I can focus my capstone and land a job that I can enjoy after school.

I having some trouble with a project for a subject at university. The project focuses on using an Arduino board and at least one sensor module (bought/made at home). I chose making a 3D printed robotic hand that I can move using my forearm muscles. I've seen that the [MyoWare EMG Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13723) can be used for detecting muscle movement but only on one muscle as far as I understand from its [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Biometric/MyowareUserManualAT-04-001.pdf). I've also seen that there is an armband that can be used to measure muscle movement on 6 channels but unfortunately I have a short budget for this project so I can't afford it and I would also love to learn more about these sensors by building them myself to some possible extent.

How can I create a circuit that is similar to the MyoWare Sensor but with multiple 3-set(Reference, Mid-Muscle, End-Muscle) electrodes? The goal of the project is to be able to detect individual finger movement and wrist rotation.

A reference to my question would be this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vJ3qqQ4Rvs). How did he manage to create multiple channels? I would be glad if any of you have any ideas on how can I make a similar circuit.

49,"[ME] Junior still looking for a summer internship, help",1553574529,"Hello all.

As the title states I am a mechanical engineering major, aerospace engineering minor finishing their junior year and I am still looking for an internship.

I have a 3.15 (working most of my college career) and a bunch of hobbies/side projects that I feel are pertinent (automotive, arduino, 3D printing, design projects). At the beginning of the year I was being picky, applying to companies I knew that I wanted to work for. I went to the career fair, got a couple offers to small companies, one that wouldn't work and the other that I straight up wasn't interested in.

Then I met someone that works for a large aerospace/defense company who offered to help me get an internship. I thought for sure I was set, I was in contact with an HR person (at a different facility) who told me I was being considered for a position in January and would update me when the positions either filled or I was being offered. I have not heard from that HR person since. I continued to talk to the person I knew in the company and he decided to just contact his manager directly at his facility. A couple days later he told me I would be getting a call to just talk about my resume/interests and to set up a formal phone interview. I thought for sure I was in, I kind of haulted my searching at that point. This was late February. At this point I have not received a call from anyone, and have not received an email back from the HR person.

I contacted my friend again and he is going to contact his manager again tomorrow but I am now getting really hopeless with finding an internship. About a week and a half I spent my day off applying to a ton of places, I bet I applied to around 20, a few of which my schools email system sent out notifications about (a couple of them local) and I have not received a single thing from any of those.

What am I doing wrong? I am starting to get seriously nervous that I am going to end up without an internship and when I graduate have a very hard time getting employed.

Any help is appreciated, thank you.

TL;DR: Got a couple offers last semester but declined, then was sure I was getting an opportunity at a company only to get ghosted entirely.

50,Our companies main project is coming to a close,1553570312,"Hi all - I come here hoping to seek a bit of advice about a situation that is going on at my workplace.  I am a mechanical engineer working for a smallish company that creates assembly lines.  When a company wants to create a new product, they can hire us to design and manufacture the tooling and automation.  However, the work is based entirely on winning contracts and my company doesn't seem to be winning any lately.  So we have had this huge project for a while and we have hired to meet the needs of the project.  Now that the project is closing, there is less work to be done.  Ideally, engineers would be transferred over to a new project as they finish their responsibilities on this project, but there does not seem to be a new project and there is little communication from the people (management)  with the information about what to expect.  

Frankly, it sucks around the office right now as everyone is worried about their jobs and the people with work still to be done are overburdening themselves in order to hold on to what little job security they have.  It is as if finishing your project is an incentive to be fired since there is nothing new to be assigned.   Right now I am scrounging for jobs and I keep finding the shitty jobs that are only around because no one wants to do them.  It sucks and it's making me unhappy but it's all I can do.  Boss is starting to get frustrated with people asking him for work to do.  I guess I am looking for some strategies to cope with the ups and downs of workload, mostly the downs.

Im currently im my 3rd year of electrical engineering but im really starting to think that electrical engineering isn't the career path that's best for me. I choose engineering because I loved physics, motion in particular and initially had enrolled into aerospace engineering but swapped into electrical after everyone told be that it had more jobs, also i had 2 friends that were doing electrical and because im quite shy so I stupidly used that a factor in favour of enrolling in electrical engineering. My initial plan was to swap after first year if I didn't like electrical but the first year for the two degree were very different and I did like the course quite a bit. However now in third year im very demotivated and not enjoying the content much. 

I've done some research and found that mechanical engineering is very appealing to me, however if i transfer now ill lose 3 years of study(including this year) and will essentially be starting from year 1 as the first year of the degrees don't have much in common. So i was wondering what your advice would be, should i finish my degree and then do masters in mechanical if thats possible? Are there jobs in electrical engineering that is more spactial and tanglie(this is something important to me)?  Did anyone else feel like this during their degree? Is this just 3rd year exhaustion? Does anyone here have a EE degree but work in a more ME sort of job?  I just hate the thought of having wasted 3 years of my life but I dont want to be stuck in a job i dont like.

64,Games to introduce you to engineering?,1553539894,"[B]First, I'd like to give a little bit of backstory:[/b]

I'm at a crossroads in my life right now. In my 30's and attempting to go back to college. My whole life I've always wanted to do some college but I have been soul searching for years on what I wanted to do and never could figure it out. Now I'm at the age where I've decided I better go to school for something or give up on it.

I went to college when I was younger for Computer Programming and didn't like it and dropped out. My interests have changed quite a bit now though. My issue is that I've never had any particular passions before and spent much of my life just playing video games. Now I'm finding it more and more boring to just sit down and play videos games and I want to be challenged mentally while also doing something beneficial to mankind.

My reasons for wanting to go to college is both because I simply just want a degree in something but also because im at the point in my career in which I cannot progress any further without a degree. The cost of college isn't an issue for me, as I will be going on the GI Bill. I'm not looking to replace my current job but I would like to have a degree I can fall back on if anything ever happens in a field I atleast semi-enjoy.

Due to the fact I never really built up any skills nor ever explored my passions I'm kind of at a blank slate. My childhood was fairly sheltered so I never had a moment in my life where someone handed a camera to me and I knew what I wanted to be from then on or anything. I also never grew up with any heroes or hobbies and when asked what I wanted to be I once responded with ""Pizza Delivery Boy"". I've read many stories of Engineers that just knew they wanted to be one from an early age. Or ones that had some sort of childhood story that translated to a passion for Engineering later in life. I have no stories like that.

At first I wanted to go for Psychology, then Economics, then someone mentioned Engineering to me. I had always been a really huge fan of Math (I even considered being an Mathematician) but for some reason I just never considered Engineering. I actually found that career path to be intimidating since it was always described to me as very hard work that you needed to have a passion and an aptitude for.

[B]To the point:[/b]

I've already looked up multiple sources for what the pros and cons of the career field is. I'm not here to ask you guys about that, and I think I saw a rule against it. What I'm wondering is for those of you who are gamers what games would you suggest that give a general feel for engineering in a way which I could see if the type of work is interesting to me. I have already looked up Kerbal Space Program and Factorio, but I'm not sure if they translate into actual engineering enough.

Is there any suggestions for engineering games that translate to the real world? Also, side question, is there anything else you guys would suggest for me to try to test my interests in engineering?

I'm currently a mechanic and many people in my family are as well. Maintenance is alright, I never had a huge interest in it though, but the job is alright and it's what I know. I also talked to my friend who is currently going for Technology Engineering and he describes it in a way where it's not as hard as I think it is and he doesn't have a passion for it but it's decent.

As long as I somewhat have an interest in it and I don't hate it then I may pursue a career in engineering.

The context is as follows: 

In my case, I have done analysis on chain links pins, rails and bearing. There are about 150 pins in 2 sets of parallel chains, the way that i have done the analysis is that i have taken the time between failures for the same issue(broken/sheared pin) and averaged them out. I am expecting a question on the above.   
I mean i understand that it would be very impractical to locate and find the exact failure time for each and every one of the 150 pins, but im asking for another argument.

I'm doing a special electrical engineering and physics major as one of the major reasons I decided on this route is because I love physics. I feel like I enjoy my physics classes a lot more because the concepts fascinate me. But I do want to eventually apply the concepts towards developing new technologies for space travel. Here are my questions:

1) Do I take an extra year and apply for a co-op? I'm already 30 and have two more years in my program. I will probably be around 33 if I just go straight through, but I'm running out of money (I don't get any financial aid because I'm a second bachelor student) so a co-op would be great to help me continuing to pay for college, and it will give me good experience. I'm also thinking it will give me a little mental break from school as I'm beginning to feel burnt-out/bored at school.

2) Do I focus on research that isn't aerospace related, or do I focus on an aerospace club that doesn't do research. R&amp;D positions seem to favor those with research degrees which makes sense. I would love to go to a great graduate school, but I likely need to have publications in addition to a high GPA. The GPA is no problem at the moment, but I am worried about not getting published. One problem is I feel utterly bored with my research area, though I feel like if I can focus on my undergrad research, I might get some publications within the next few years. The other thing vying for my time is this aerospace club which is really interesting. They do awesome work with rockets and are putting up a satellite soon. However it's a mainly student run club and will not likely lead to me getting published. I feel like I need to pick one and run with it otherwise I run the risk of doing both badly. Should I focus on making myself a good graduate candidate by trying to get published in a field that's not directly related to aerospace (it's microwaves), or should I focus on doing projects in the field in which I hope to work (the aerospace club)?

As I continue meeting more people in the industry, I often hear that they have bounced company to company due to the nature of contracts. It is also common to find out that these people have been laid off in the past. This leaves me uneasy, because I decided to study engineering for its job security.

I also feel like there is a huge age gap in the workforce. In my experience, there are plenty of engineers who have 30+ years or 0-5 years in the industry and very few in between. I have a strong suspicion that companies exclusively seek and hire people with clearances for mid-career to late-career positions.

**My questions for those in the industry:**

- What are your opinions on job security for the industry? Is it just expected to get laid off and move around companies?
- Do you think people often get pigeonholed into the industry because their clearances, knowledge, and skills generally cannot be directly transferred to something different?

As I continue meeting more people in the industry, I often hear that they have bounced company to company due to the nature of contracts. It is also common to find out that these people have been laid off in the past. This leaves me uneasy, because I decided to study engineering for its job security.

I also feel like there is a huge age gap in the workforce. In my experience, there are plenty of engineers who have 30+ years or 0-5 years in the industry and very few in between. I have a strong suspicion that companies exclusively seek and hire people with clearances for mid-career to late-career positions.

**My questions for those in the industry:**
- What are your opinions on job security for the industry? Is it just expected to get laid off and move around companies?
- Do you think people often get pigeonholed into the industry because their clearances, knowledge, and skills generally cannot be directly transferred to something different?
- Have you met someone in a technical role that started their career in the industry at mid-career without a clearance?
- Can you be successful (in a well-respected role) in this industry without needing to complete polygraph exams?

I love my company and the people, but know the industry is not for everyone. I’m trying to figure out where I stand before it gets ""too late."" **Any comments/advice appreciated and feel free to ask follow-up questions *(I tried to make this post short and simple)***.

78,Is it worth doing a technology degree in civil engineering if it also leads directly into a bachelor degree?,1553531660,"I'm a 24 year old returning to university after a long break.

Is the technology degree path the way to go? They help me find an internship also in the industry as it's a requirement to graduate, and I'm thinking I'd be gaining valuable practical skills which I can use towards finding a job whilst finishing off my bachelor degree.

The voltage drop is already calculated into the 4.5v from the batteries for each lamp, and it shouldn't change if the lamps are wired in parallel, I think.

21,"The Missouri River is currently flooding parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Iowa. A 9 square mile retention pond with an average depth of 36 feet could alleviate 10% of the flooding for a week. Is building something like this feasible and/or what would be some of the challenges to consider?",1553454022,"Lots of questions here. 

First, over the last 10 days, the Missouri River near Omaha, Nebraska has averaged about [150,000 cubic feet per second flow rate](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ne/nwis/uv?cb_00010=on&amp;cb_00060=on&amp;cb_00065=on&amp;format=gif_default&amp;site_no=06610000&amp;period=&amp;begin_date=2019-03-10&amp;end_date=2019-03-24).

An area 3 miles by 3 miles, that's been slightly dug down and built up around the perimeter to give a potential depth of 36 feet would provide enough volume to hold a lot(7 days at 15,000 CF/Sec) of water. Enough to absorb 10% of the river flow for 1 week. Given that the top of the river is currently higher than 36 feet, it would require no pumping, and when the river water level recedes, the retention pond just could be opened back up to later release the water back into the river.

It seems like to me that this could be pretty useful in reducing the water level in the river enough to prevent a significant amount of flooding.

I know certain areas along the Missouri/Mississippi rivers are designated for intentional emergency flooding(the Atchafalaya basin for example), but people also live and work in that area. However, I'm not aware of any specially-built areas meant exclusively for water retention in flood times like this, which makes me think it must not be practical/possible.

2)  Do you fear automation, irrelevancy, competition from China, AI, etc?  I know that Revit has made the hand calculations and a lot of the other scutwork of structural engineering obsolete but it's not like they don't still teach the field.  

3) They say the shelf life of a programmer is 10 years, I did 15 professionally.  Are there similar expectancies in actual construction engineering?

4) Is the work constant or does it follow the boom/bust cycle of real estate?  If so, what can you do to protect yourself?

5) I have found my industry to be biased against older people  and would much rather interview younger candidates than vice versa.  Have any of you interviewed in later years of your career and seen any of this?  

6) Is it normal to be at the same firm for a very long time and still be relevant and fulfilled?   If you work for yourself, are clients reasonable and professional and easy to manage?

7) Is the PE stamp hard to keep and maintain when you are otherwise working full time?

8) How do you get to the point where you are comfortable that the work you are doing won't kill anyone?

9) Anything else I might have missed?",AskEngineers,False,combuchan,/r/AskEngineers/comments/b4m6hs/considering_a_career_change_from_it_to/

I am a prospective engineering student likely to attend UMD next fall.

I listed below what I have so far. Thanks in advance!

Mechanical

Pros: Very broad field and lots of defense contractors near UMD.

Cons: I'm not that into design. However, I won't entirely rule out that I can't grow into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fire Protection:

Pros: High starting salary, higher emphasis on science then on design, strong job market, and UMD is the only ABET undergraduate program in the country.

Cons: It seems extremely specialized and a rather small industry (although in high demand for it's numbers). ",AskEngineers,False,wondering840,/r/AskEngineers/comments/b4lbci/fire_protection_vs_mechanical_engineering/

I was a premed, and had full intentions of going to med school after graduating from the start, but I've recently had a change of heart after shadowing a few physicians and have realized working as a doctor isn't for me.

I want to do engineering and work in product development and design in the industry, but I don't know how I'll transition to that after my Biology degree. I thought about going to grad school and getting a Master's in BME, but after a lot of research I've come to the conclusion that a BME master's isn't worth it for trying to get a job in the industry, and most biotech companies will hire ME's or EE's instead.

So I'm completely lost on what to do. All I know is that ME is probably the best choice for going into product development and design. I'm not sure if I should immediately jump into another BS for ME after getting my Biology degree, or if I should apply for a Master's in ME.

68,Chemistry student unsure about further education,1553347632,"I am currently in my fourth semester of my chemistry studies in switzerland. What I have realised however, is that I REALLY don't care about the atom stuff, which is a big part of chemistry. I like the maths behind it, so Physical chemistry is fine, but Anorganic and Organic chemistry is not for me. Also, I am 100% sure that I don't want to ever touch a lab again, nor work with any equipment.

You might see how chemistry isn't the best choice for a bachelor, but we can easily switch to chemical engineering until the end of this year, as both have the shared 4 semesters.

However, I don't really know if that is ideal for me either. Out of all the education I have received, I would say that my favorite subjects were IT and maths, followed by Physical Chemistry and physics. (Minus quantum stuff, maybe). Right now I'm looking into Python, pandas and data stuff, and this looks really fun, but is not a part of my curriculum.

Data science, wheter involving chemistry or not would be my pick #1 right now, but of course I have seen only a limited number of things that can be done with chemistry. So the question would be, what now? Should I see if I can complete my Bachelors degree and see if I can get accepted into the Data Science masters degree? It is said that it is aimed at CS, Maths, Physics, Mechanical engineering and so on Bachelors, so I'm not sure if it's an option. Or is it possible to complete a Masters in ChemEng and just get hired as a Data Scientist if I learn on my own?

Other than that, what are some non-lab related things I can do with a Chemistry of Chemical Engineering MS?

A little bit of context... i pretty much got road-block due to an unavailable course for the upcoming semester and unsatisfied pre-req which i tried to bypass by talking with the professor (ANSWER IS A HARD NO), i am little ahead of my year base on the courses i'm taking, so things are weird with satisfying course conditions. So i want to ask you guys for your opinion and insight... I am pursuing a second co-op, highly prefer a specialized design co-op (FPGA, ASIC, Digital design, SoC, anything that can offer design experience) for SPRING 2020, so i will be taking courses for this FALL 2019.

Below are courses opened for me
EECE.4810 (Grad ver. EECE 5730) Operating Sys &amp; Kernel Design (https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/eece/4810) EECE.4820 (Grad ver. EECE 5610) Comp.

Courses i wanted to take but fate said ""no"" to me
EECE.4500 (Grad ver. EECE 5500) Advanced Digital System Design (https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/EECE/4500)

EECE.5620 VHDL/Verilog Synthesis &amp; Design (https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/eece/5620)

Technical Elective ( I have one opening )
This was originally gonna be used for the course EECE.5620 VHDL/Verilog Synthesis &amp; Design.

I am aware there is.... but the course above ^ is my highly prefered for the one technical elective space i have left... We had two spaces originally, but my first co-op covers one...(However, i will check these out if you guys really recommend the content base on the info provided)

EECE.4690 (Grad ver. 5020) VLSI Design

EECE.4700 (Grad ver.5040) VLSI Fabrication

EECE.4720 (Grad ver.5720) Embedded Real time Sys

EECE.5750 FPGA Logic Design Techniques

EECE.6510 Advanced embedded design with FPGA

EECE.5770 Verification of Digital Systems

For course description, just copy/past and search.

Some these don't have a catalog description but over at this professor website has an in-depth overview of the courses (he teaches it) http://www.jmoranuml.x10host.com/

Below are the catalog links to all courses, if you happen to see any other good courses in the catalog, let me know!

Overall things look a bit grim for me at the moment... i will still be trying to search for SPRING 2019 with what i got, if i don't get a decent design position (aiming for some decent corporate), i will likely try again after taking the courses i wasn't able to...

I'm in uncharted territory, and wanted to see if others had similar experience and/or advice to share.
I'm a manufacturing engineer, and have been in this role for about 9+ months. I love my job, its exciting, engaging, and I have a lot of freedom, responsibility, and a great team.

I also have a ""tech"" (he doesn't have a degree, but has worked at the plant for 7+ years) assigned to me. I'm not his manager, but he is effectively my employee as I give him tasks and projects. We have a good relationship, but as I get more involved in the process and have less time to spend with him as I manage projects, I'm noticing a trend.

For example, I will give him a task to knock out, say figure out what tool(s) the folks on the floor need. I give him some resources (list of tools that we usually hand out to our operators) and some suggestions where to start. 30 Minutes later he hits me up with a massive email with questions (I've made it clear he needs to be more concise with his communication, but it has not stuck). I google for a minute and answer most of the questions. I advise on what to do with the remaining. He hits me again with more questions. I google more. Rinse and repeat with other tasks and small projects.

It's getting to the point where I will spend a whole morning answering his questions or prodding him to get where he needs next.
I desperately need every minute of my day to get things done (coordinate with contractors, model workstations (high hit on time) and get quotes, order repair parts, etc) and it really kills me when I get derailed by something trivial.

I've made it clear to him that he's okay to make decisions without me, even if he makes a mistake its fine as long as he put some thought into it.

He has expressed that he want to learn CAD, but I fear that I don't have enough time to get him through the basics AND help him as he inevitably runs into issues with his modeling.

Basically my question is this; how do I get my tech, who has a long history of being an operator and being very explicitly told what to do all day long to grow into an independent thinker and problem solver?

It certainly isn't that easy as strapping the blades on the motor and done.

94,Is there such a thing as a 2-speed speed reducer that can switch back and forth between low torque high speed and high torque low speed and that works with a single hydraulic pump and motor?,1553282969,"Is there such a thing as a two speed speed reducer? My application is an old drill rig that we are trying to get working to its full capacity again. The output of the speed reducer should be 1970 lb-ft and 90 RPM for high torque and low speed, and 985 lb-ft and 180 RPM for low torque and high speed. With the same hydraulic pump and motor, I want the system to provide both speeds by using a 2-speed speed reducer that allows us to switch back and forth. I haven't chosen a hydraulic pump or motor yet, because I want to work backwards from the output torque and speed, to the speed reducer, to the hydraulic motor, and finally to the pump.

Does such a speed reducer exist? If it does, what would I have to google to find models online? And would anyone know any specific manufacturers that make this product?",AskEngineers,False,ElCapivara,/r/AskEngineers/comments/b49bc8/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_2speed_speed_reducer/
95,Can solar power be transmitted wirelessly?,1553279178,"For example if a collection of people in a stadium for example were to each use a solar power bank, could the collective energy generated be used to power something on the field in real-time? 

A simple yay or nay would suffice but if you have the time,  an ELI5 explanation would be so helpful! This is for a school project. Help a sister out!

96,Civil Engineers working in the auto industry?,1553279083,"Hi guys, I was wondering if there are any CEs that work in the auto industry. I assumed there’s a minority from the transportation or structural sector that work on design and testing of new cars. If anyone took this path, or knows someone who did and could provide any info I’d appreciate it.

99,Searching for a way to go about drawing up a standard detail.,1553277246,"I've been modifying old details to fit my design and it's a bit time consuming. So I want make a stardard list of details where items such as lengths, bar size, amount of reinforcem, etc. are just variables. I would then have a table next to it listing what the variables are. The issue I'm having is that it doesn't look very professional. So I'm wondering what do I have to research to improve the look of it.
