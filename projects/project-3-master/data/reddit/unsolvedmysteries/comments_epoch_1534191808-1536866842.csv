1,How to re-enter industry after 6 year hiatus? (mental illness related),1536862943,"Cross post from r/engineers weekly career thread

Hey, everyone!

So I'm looking for feedback on how to get back into the field. I'm trying to be as honest as possible here (both with you and myself) to really get a good idea of what I should do.

The hurdle I'm trying to overcome is that I've been out of the industry for about 6 years now, and I'd like to re-enter in whatever way I can. I understand it may take some time or maybe even some retraining. I'm just trying to get an idea of what that actually looks like, so hiring managers PLEASE chime in.

​

About Me:

I graduated in 2009 with my BSME at a 3.6 GPA, full-ride scholarship, worked as an intern for my scholarship sponsor. I then graduated in 2011 with my MSME (coursework only) at a 3.97 GPA while working full-time for my BSME scholarship sponsor. I loved the work there (R&amp;D for US Govt, secret clearance level) but the company has a paradigm shift and we no longer matched. In August of 2012, I left the company in pursuit of greater income. After that, I worked for six months at another R&amp;D company only to realize (in hindsight) that I had burned myself out. Well, come to find out years later, I was actually suffering from severe mental illness. Now I'm on medication for it, and things are looking up! So I'm ready to get back into the game :)

​

1. How can I put this 6 year hiatus on my resume in a professional way that will do the least damage to my hirability?  
During this time I traveled, worked part-time jobs in unrelated fields (usually service or sales) and worked on my own personal projects, so my skills are not sharp but they're not completely gone either.
2. Do I need to go back to school?  
I'm thinking as soon as I can, I'd like to pivot into something with more of a software development aspect to it, perhaps in robotics fields. I'm not sure if I need to go get another BS for that or if I just need to find the right company?
3. If you were interviewing me, what would you ask me about the 6 year gap? Would I even be considered? How can I salvage my career?

2,Balancing question for rotating equipment.,1536862000,"So if a person is making a machine with a reciprocating saw assembly using a crank arm and flywheel, is an approximate balance point 180 degrees away from the pivot point at the crank arm? 

I designed a flywheel in fusion 360, cut away exactly as much material as the moving assembly weighs and made the centre if gravity exactly the opposite of the pivot point for the connecting rod.  Think it will be close to balanced? Or am I missing how much weight is rotating around in the circle and how far that weight is from the centre of mass? 

My trades brain is great at geometry and trig but I read the engineering info on designing balanced assemblies and my brain broke.  I did not do well in physics way back a quarter century ago. 

This machine runs at a pretty low RPM. Like 700 or so (variable).  The flywheel is 5” by 1/2” stainless. My connecting rod pin is 0.5” off centre and my centre of mass is now exactly the opposite of my crank pin. Am I getting close or did I completely miss the mark? (The model is still digital right now).  I’m not looking for perfect here. The machine does have some gravity to it so it will absorb some vibration.

I am supposed to be graduating next Spring, but I pushed it back one year because I was offered an internship position at Norfolk Southern and accepted it immediately. Reason why I accepted it because I was not able to get any internship positions while in college, until now (Couldn't resist to pass up on this golden opportunity to gain some real world engineering experience. Also I'm always fascinated by trains and how it works ever since I was a kid lol, and thought this might be an interesting and perhaps fun learning experience).

My internship's department is Strategic planning. From my understanding, the main responsibility of this department is to optimize rail load and track efficiency. 

However, since my previous experience is in retail and ecommerce (I owned an ecommerce store while in college and was pretty successful.), I have no experience or knowledge on how the railroad industry works. None of my parents, relative, or close friends work in the railroad industry.

1. What should I expect working for a railroad company like Norfolk Southern? 
2. What can/should I do that will make me successful in this industry?
3. What are the things that I should watch out for? 
4. How can I prepare myself from now until the first day on work? (Like softwares/skills I need to learn right now)

29,Employer expects me to teach myself C++in my free time... is this normal?,1536796310,"I'm approaching the 7 month mark at my first job out of school. My employer recently told me that they want me to learn C++ for a project I am to work on in the near future. They offered to reimburse me at the end of the semester if I fronted the cost of a night class, which I agreed to. However, once I started the class I was immediately concerned by the quality of instruction and was skeptical that I would gain anything from it. 

I shared these concerns with my team's manager (we'll call her Alice) and suggested that I get a refund for the course and teach myself instead, since I feel I would learn more that way. She agreed with my assessment and told me that they would give me a few weeks and then send me some exercises to help test what I had learned. I told her that sounded good and that I would get started teaching myself with the materials I had found and left it at that.

The next day, IT installed Visual Studio on my machine and I spent a couple of days working through lessons and teaching myself. But then just yesterday my direct supervisor (we'll call him Joe) stopped by my office and asked what I had been working on. I told him, and he said that he didn't think Alice ""had intended that to be contract work."" In other words, I'm not supposed to teach myself C++ on company time.

I could understand this if I were so busy with other critical tasks that they needed me to focus on instead. But it's actually quite the opposite. My time at the company has been interminably slow and dull, and most of the things they ask me to do are trivial busywork, seemingly scrounged up so that I actually have something to do. There is a larger, long-term project that I've been working with Joe on, but it's been bottlenecked due to his unresponsiveness and inaction so I've been spending a lot of time waiting on him (that's honestly a whole other can of worms I might end up making a post about...).

Anyway, it's now clear to me that I'm expected to spend my free time doing a work-related task for no pay. I am salaried, but I am required to log my hours worked and am explicitly paid to work 40 hours per week. The company has an official overtime policy, but I was not offered overtime pay for this work. 

Ultimately, it's not the end of the world if I have to teach myself in my free time. But I can't help but feel like I'm being taken advantage of. Am I being unreasonable/entitled? Is there some aspect to this from management's point of view that I'm missing? Just wanted to get some perspective on this situation from some more experienced folks.

Spearguns are basically a cross between a slingshot and a crossbow. The rear end of the spear is locked into the trigger mechanism on the gun, then elastic bands are stretched from the muzzle of the gun and hooked behind a small catch at the rear of the spear. [Here's a photo.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1315/4801/products/Standard3-top-side.gif?v=1489084408) 

Spear shafts are solid steel, and are available in 6.5 mm, 7 mm, and 7.5 mm diameters.

Most guys get narrow shafts because the lighter weight leads to a faster muzzle velocity.  Which I agree with. 

But they assume that faster muzzle velocity also means a longer effective range. And I'm not so sure. Water is heavy, and it seems like a heavier spear might be able to travel farther before running out of momentum.  

My question: Holding the shaft length and speargun power are constant, what effect does shaft diameter have on the maximum range and terminal ballistics of the shot?

I'm here on the sub to learn more about engineering. I'm just learning about Cycloidal gears and the difference between them and planetary gears. Anyone every heard of us? We're in like 75% of the industrial robots in the US.

So far, my understanding is that the Planetary gears can provide a great amount of torque. But, the reason our cycloidal gears work well is bc we can provide the same amount of torque in a smaller gearbox. Which works well with more applications.

I'm new. I'm still trying to understand if I have that down. Any help would be great for torque, ratios, things like that.",AskEngineers,False,nabtescomotiongeek,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9fa63r/cycloidal_vs_planetary_gears_still_learning/
40,Electrical Engineering Master's student looking for research topics / ideas (not necessarily for a thesis),1536773914,"As the title suggests!

Quick summary: My undergrad was in Computer Engineering with a specialization in VLSI, Electronics and Digital Logic. I prematurely applied for Master's in Electrical Engineering (this department has more focuses towards digital design) because I didn't find work right away and now I'm in my 2nd semester of grad school. Funny enough, at the end of the 1st semester (this spring), I started an internship locally with a fairly big company over the summer and am now working there part-time, basically waiting for me to graduate so they can get me on full-time.

After working there however, my interests have broadened even more and I'm unsure on what to look into. I'm still debating on doing a Thesis so I'm in a directed study class for the semester to research potential topics for a thesis (those who do the non-thesis route at this University are required to do a directed study anyways so this covers my base if I decide to stray away from a thesis). Obviously if I do go down the thesis route, this directed study class can be looked at as a preview/prelude to the topic.

My interests include FPGAs/VHDL/Verilog projects (or getting into UVM verification), ADC-DAC, audio/image signal processing, power systems, and digital communication (systems). I'm still brainstorming topics as my adviser hasn't really given me much to look into. Really, I find a lot of these topics interesting but I'm having a hard time narrowing down topics.

I'm going to informally meet with other professors within the department to help filter some ideas later this week as well.

52,How to approach finding failure stress in a real-life system?,1536759414,"Hi all, 

So I'm a recent ME graduate and have been at my job for around 6 months before finally being asked to perform a task that requires mechanical design. Even though it's been a while since I've had to use the equations, I still mostly remember how to solve textbook problems of failure stress on individual beams, but I don't think I've ever had a realistic problem where I have more than one beam and a force that is directly applied to that beam. 

Here's my task at hand: I need to build a small steel platform (like 5'x5'), most likely using steel beams and having a welder weld it together into a square frame w/ 4 legs then a thin steel sheet on top. The dead weight will be in the middle of the platform and I plan to add another steel beam running through the center of the frame for extra support. So where do I begin applying what I learned in school? Does the eccentricity of the load effect the legs, or can I just divide the weight among the four legs and treat it as a downward force? And what about the beams in the frame, how do I apply those forces to each individual beam for stress analysis?

Our QC inspection process is very strict; these samples would not have made it into stock, but they are obviously acceptable.  I've reached out to the customer multiple times requesting any drawings or other documentation they received with the acquisition, but have not had anything returned.  This leads me to believe they either do not perform dimensional inspection on their end.   I've also presented the idea of drawing changes that reflect the samples, but that was turned down.

72,"Currently in the medical field, and just curious about engineering.",1536708515,"Hi, just wanted to give some background and get some opinions from people currently in the engineering field.

 I'm 31 years old and married with an 8 year old child, I am an Physical Therapist Assistant(Associate's Degree) working near Montgomery AL. I've been a therapist since 2014, during this time I worked in a variety of settings including: hospital, outpatient, inpatient, and now I do Home Health therapy. My entry level position payed roughly 45k per year, and I made additional money roughly $40 an hour working PRN for rehab centers for additional income, my second year of employment I got another job and made roughly 55k working at a skilled nursing facility, fast forward to now I make roughly 65-75k per year doing Home Health (this varies on the hours I'm willing to work and the number of visits I do, as I am payed specifically per treatment given). Generally I work around 35-42 hours a week, it just depends on the companies current need, and if they want me to go out of town to pick up extra visits and overall general census of patients. Anyway I give this background because I have pretty much moved up as far as an LPTA can, originally when I was researching the career I didn't even realize I could make this much money... I was just looking at going from my crappy $9 an hour job to what I thought would be a $20 per hour career so that I could support my wife and son(that was on the way at the time)... My goal at that time was just to get into a career that payed decent money fast, following some research I found LPTA. I started school immediately worked 3x crappy jobs(while going to night school) to get both me and my wife through school(she went to ultrasonography school, and hated it and is now a photographer who does pretty well). Anyway the rest is history, and here I am doing therapy day in and day out. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing about it is... I am really not a huge fan of the job. Generally I see about 6-8 patients a day, and to be honest out of 8 people only 2-3 are actually nice likeable people. The rest are generally poorly educated, non-compliant, and treat us healthcare workers like a huge hinderance, despite the fact that they need us to get back to where they can perform self-care. Also it's worth noting that the treatments performed take place in these people's homes, and when I say some of them are entirely filthy that only begins to describe some of the horrors I have seen. At the end of the day, I do question the long-term effects some of these places will have on my health, as these people smoke indoors, have tons of animals(literally seen it so bad that you can smell cat spray on your clothes when you leave the home despite not coming in contact or touching anything!), and also are just run down with mold, and most likely asbestos, and lead paint....

&amp;#x200B;

With all this being said, I am here because I am seriously looking at going back to school and for engineering I've been really looking into Electrical. I will most likely just do night school and do it a little at a time, until the point where I have to take it on full time, at the end of the day I am in no rush, I just want to find a field I can see myself retiring from without getting blacklung etc..

&amp;#x200B;

So for all of you engineers out there what do you like about your current job? Do you regret your decisions to become an engineer? Is the field something you would recommend to someone who is currently in an unrelated field and would be starting from scratch?

I’m working on the Baja SAE team for my senior design project in college. There are 8 of us on the team, all mechanical engineering students.

8,Frustrated of working in a pathetic work environment. How to report to HR?,1536628845," 

Hello everyone. So I have this major issue at work, which I desperately need some help with. Long post warning. Thanks in advance!

I graduated with my master's degree from UCLA last year, and have been working at my current place as a mechanical engineer (HVAC) in New York City for 11 months now. This was the only offer I got, so I had to take up the job. 

1st part of the story:

The offer was very low given the location and my qualifications. The offer was for $ 65k. When I tried to negotiate with my supervisor, and explain to him that I have a higher degree, so why should I settle for a bachelor's graduate pay. He seemed to agree with me and promised to reevaluate my pay in 3 months. He never did. I went up to him several times. Every time he would sincerely thank me for reminding him and promised to do that soon, but never do it. After reminding him 3 times, I let it be. As I don't want to start in this job for long anyway and a more interested in other fields.

2nd part:

I sure next to an obnoxious person. He is a project manager. We have a number of project managers in the office. He has a reputation of being mean, selfish, and rude to the people working for him. Initially, I was astonished by his behavior. Since this is my first job, I thought this is how it just be everywhere. But boy it kept getting worse and worse. He refers to us new hires as kids, and would always belittle the young engineers. I sit right next to him, and he does not like me talking to anyone. He would call me out even if I ask my coworkers about their weekend. He would just say, please do the chit chatting in the after hours, and you don't get paid to chit-chat. He hates people who leave on time. He works more than 60hrs a week and expected everyone to do the same. When I would leave early for home, he would come and ask me why I don't work overtime, although I get paid for it. He keeps mumbling to himself in his native language if someone is making small talk around him, as it bothers him. He is extremely disorganized, does not understand the software we work on (Revit) and gives us insane deadlines. Recently he gave me some work and wanted me to finish the stuff by the end of the week. It was a lot of work approximately 3 weeks worth of work. I clearly told home it won't be finished by this week. He kept forcing me to finish it in a demanding manner. He does not understand the software we work on, so had no idea what the work entails. When I tried to reason with him, he just refused and asked me to seek help from a senior member to work faster on the software. There is no fast way of working on it. I kept working my ass off. Today was the tipping point. I asked him a question and he straight off left for his meeting after saying that I am like a kindergarten kid asking questions to the teacher again and again, and said ""be professional"" in a demeaning manner. I let this pass. None of his reasonings make any sense to me. He apparently wants me to complete the task ASAP (by using overtime) as we have used up a lot of hours on the job, which makes no f\*\*\*ing sense to me. 

This is my first job and I don't know how to bring this to the HR's attention. I am not on good terms with my boss as well because of the salary situation. I don't know if he has the same thought process about work. If he believes I am not a dedicated employee since I don't spend long hours in the office. Honestly, I get my work done on time, and very efficiently, without any errors. Nobody seems to care about that. Back to the point, how do I bring this to the HR's attention? Will speaking to the HR have any negative consequences? Any thoughts/inputs?",AskEngineers,False,AllIsWellBud,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9et1rh/frustrated_of_working_in_a_pathetic_work/

10,Why is Environmental Engineering considered engineering?,1536626242,"Side Note: I am a new subscriber to reddit so excuse me if I posted this in the wrong section as I do not know my way through the site yet. If that is the case please forgive me and tell me where I could post it as it is a question that bothered me for years and I want engineers advice and perspective.

Hello fellow engineers,
I hope I am asking this question in a right place if not forgive me but still guide me as I seriously need advice.
I have graduated with Bachelor degree of Environmental Engineeing from a Finnish Univeristy of Applied Science. I studied it when I was 18. My degree involved physics, math 1 and 2, environemtnal physics etc... 
Later years, I have noticed that it is insanely difficult for Environmental Engineers to get jobs, also it is a little boring degree and we have no much skills. I am really curious as to why Envionmental Engineering is Engineering at all. I actually think it makes no sense as a bachelor degree but only as a master degree where you can focus on environmental issues or sustainable solutions. As an employeer I have no idea why should I choose an Environmental Engineer over a civil, mechanical, electronic etc... engineers who can actually design and solve problems. 
I am asking this because, for years it has been bothering me, I always liked engineering and I went through a field that is not that intersting, not that in demand and makes no sense before a master degree. I really feel that Environmental Engineering should be removed and only be a sub study but NEVER independent. I am struggling to find work and every single employeer and collegue with few exceptions have talked about how it is very difficult to find work, how it is not in demand and worst of all how it is difficult to change this degree to other enginerring degree as it has nothing to do with them.
In my field of studies, We do not focus or have expertize in anything but we are like jack of all trades, we know a bit about electrcity and magnetism, a bit about waves, a bit about math, a bit geology, a bit gps, a bit statstics but almost no expertise except maybe water.

So, I am now 34, I have noticed about 6 years ago that I do not like my field of studies probably because I feel useless with it, and I have some wuestions.

1) This is the only Thing I know, is it worth studying again and what or should I just man up and try to find donthing in my field?

2) Is Environmental Engineering an engineeing degree if so why we havent learned to design anything or find environmental solutions and why is it somhard to find a job?

3) Is it worth removing environmental engineering as a degree and let a sub category of other engineering fields such as a civil engineer specializing in evnironmental matters or mechanical engineer etc....

4) Is there a reason I cannot find work? How can I sell myself if my field has little work, which translates to little experince. Even moving abroad, how can I convince a company to hire me?

5) Is it worth studying Engineering degree again? And if yes, then what, my math and physics skills I would say good or decent but I dont knownif they are top not h, cant tell. 

I apologize dearly if I post in the wrong subbreddit but I need advice from engineers specifically and maybe other people too. I apologize again.

I'm working on a woodworking art project and needed two cents from an engineer(s). I'm making a rotating ship's wheel. The question I have is about making the ship's wheel rotate. I'm finding I don't even know the right terminology in order to research how to make the wheel spin.

The ship's wheel will be mounted to a post. I want the blue portion of the wheel to rotate. But there's a second portion of the wheel I also want to rotate. That's the red portion. It's a flat decorative disk that covers the center of the wheel. As you turn the blue portion of the wheel I want the red portion to turn half as much.

So if you turn the wheel 90 degrees then the red portion only turns 45 degrees. I'm trying to find some kind of gear or rotating device that would accommodate that. But again I know even know the right vocabulary in order to research that and figure it out.

So does anyone know of anything that could be mounted onto the wheel to allow it to rotate like that? I'm at a loss here. I wanted the wheel to have an average resistance to turning. Not turning at the lightest touch but also not taking two people to turn it.

29,Looking for advice on getting started in engineering,1536598595,"Looking for advice on moving my career in the direction of engineering.  I have done a fair amount of research and talked to plenty of people about this, but I'm kind of stuck on which path I should take to my goals. 

To give you an idea of the direction of my career so far:
-BS in biochem, undergrad research in fuel cell membranes.
-First job after graduation was as a quality tech at an adhesive manufacturing plant. Day to day included quality testing (duh), OOS investigations, internal audits. Also found side work with cycle time analysis, BOM work etc. Worked with access, minitab and SAP but nothing too advanced. I was there for a year. 
-Next was a stroke of good luck followed by some awful luck: Accepted a job as a chemist at a Li ion battery manufacturer working R&amp;D, was promptly laid off 6 weeks later due to poor budgeting. Really only important because of minimal exposure to MATLAB and cool battery technology. 
-Spent the last year or so working as a contract manufacturing chemist in a fuel cell lab at a major automotive company. Most of what I do there involves a combo of troubleshooting/scale up for various manufacturing processes and general lab tech work preparing experiments for engineers. I've also been spending my own time learning excel (VBA, macros, data visualization)

So from what I've picked up I could get an MS in ChemE or materials engineering with my undergrad, after a few prerequisites.  The coursework doesn't scare me so much since math and physics are my strongest areas, and my drive to succeed in this field is pretty strong. 

The big issue here is that my current job is contract, which means no tuition reimbursement of any kind. Getting hired on full time is a possibility, but not a guarantee.  If I were to stay at my current position I would probably start prerequisites on my own dime since undergrad is more affordable, plus it might show dedication to the career shift on a resume. The other option would be to try to use my experience to get a process or manufacturing engineering job with a smaller company, hopefully one with tuition reimbursement and/or a more competitive salary so I could start my schooling then.

So, any thoughts? Should I roll the dice by staying at my current position and hope to get hired on or try my luck at an engineering position elsewhere? And would it be possible to find an engineering position with my degree and experience combo or would I need to go back to school first? The longer I wait the more anxious I become about moving forward, so I'm going to have to make a change of some kind soon.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, and my apologies for the wall of text. ",AskEngineers,False,sillygoosegoespro,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9eoxfk/looking_for_advice_on_getting_started_in/

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated with a BSEE in 2011, and spent the last six years working as a test engineer for an audio electronics company. I really liked the job and had promise of being moved up in the company, but the cost of living for the area was just too high (one of the most expensive places to live in the US). I was watching friends from university make more than me in much cheaper cities and it sort of got to me. So I took a job closer to my hometown that pays really well and the cost of living is much lower here. The position is with a power utility company as a planning engineer. It's nice to be well paid of and the job isn't difficult by any means... but that's kind of the problem. There's very little critical thinking here, not much ""engineering"" going on. Any math heavy work is estimated or outsourced. The senior engineers here that have no idea how to calculate basic things like voltage drop or transformer loading. And worst of all is the apathetic attitude most people carry at this company... it's a hard job to get fired from so you get a lot of stagnant employees and that creates a crappy environment to work in.

&amp;#x200B;

A few questions I have are... Has anyone been in a similar position? I'd like to know if I'm crazy for wanting to leave a job that is hard to find, pays exceptionally well, and is near my family. Also... would it be in bad taste to reach out to my past job to let them know this career change wasn't what I thought it would be and it has made me want to committ to my old path? I'd like to let them know that I left because of cost of living issues but would gladly reverse this decision if I could.

35,"need help with wrestling whether to continue PhD vs Masters, and choosing career path",1536573252,"There's really 3 parts to my question, and I would appreciate people with insight to shed some light in each of these areas. Thanks!

1. feeling lost

I currently work with battery research in a PhD program. I came back to school, after working as an entry level engineer, in a toxic work environment, because 1). I care about enabling of renewable energy through energy storage and 2). I wanted a fresh start in a different industry than oil/gas. It's been nearly 2.5 years since I've started my program, and i've since learned that there doesn't seem to be as much excitement/promise in battery research as I had thought. There is much greater emphasis on incremental development of batteries through engineering. In turn, it seems like I could be more useful as an engineer now, with a Master's degree, newly acquired knowledge and skillset, as opposed to continue making papers that virtually no-one will read. OTOH, almost all battery researchers have PhD's..

&amp;#x200B;

2. work life balance.

Also, I'm in my late 20s, and am realizing that there are other aspects of my life that I should be prioritizing, other than work, such as having a better social life, or developing myself as a competitive cyclist (another passion of mine). I feel like grad school definitely works against me in terms giving me the freedom to develop myself in areas other than research, and a great concern is that this trend may continue as a scientist after grad school. I love science, but not enough to give my life to it. As a PhD level engineer, I feel like there is quite a bit of weight on the shoulders to dive into the unknown, while as a Master's level engineer, the path is sort of already laid out for you.

&amp;#x200B;

3. pigeon holing myself

a PhD is very specific, and I think that definitely shuts more doors than it opens. At this point, I'm not even sure I'd stay in batteries, because of how saturated the field is. It's basically an arms race to see who can make the cheapest, best product, and right now, Asia is winning. That said, maybe having a more versatile degree is better.. What do y'all think?

[This|https://twitter.com/FulbyTech/status/1038769111348727810] is what I've currently got but it pumps for a minute before even moving the needle on the manometer. Manually pumping using the same Lego pump I can pump it up to 1 bar in 45 seconds. Can anyone tell me how I should redesign this to pump up the pressure faster?

The requirements are:
* Needs to be small enough to be strapped to a user's arm or fit in a bum bag.
* Powered by a 12V battery pack, USB power bank or similar. Something like [this|https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0713T4XT9/]. I really don't want to use LiPo batteries due to their care requirements and fragility.
* Can be turned on and off from an Arduino (I'm currently using an MPX5700AP pressure sensor to control the pump motor via a MOSFET).
* Pump the air tank to 2-3 bar (30-45 psi) above atmospheric pressure, though I think 2 bar is enough for prototyping from manually pumping up the tank.

86,5v to 3.3v I2C still causing damage to 3.3v IC?,1536374299,"So looking through the NXP level shifting guide [here](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN10441.pdf), specifically in section 2.1.1, I'm wondering if there's some wiggle room in most/all ICs for exceeding the maximum ratings.  For instance, hooking up a SI7006 (RH/Temp sensor on 3.3v), for which you can see the data sheet [here](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si7006-A20.pdf), on page 10/Table 7, the max voltage on I/O pins is VDD+0.3v, or for my case, 3.6v.

Say I have an Arduino Uno at 5v, going through a common BSS138 (data sheet [here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/BreakoutBoards/BSS138.pdf)) level shifter array, to the Si7006.  The Si7006 is responding to a request, pulls the line low, which goes to situation 2 of the NXP guide in section 2.1.1. In this scenario, Si7006 pulls low, the FET gate is activated, causing a smidge of power to run from the 5v line through the pullup, through the FET with a forward voltage of 0.8v, leaving 4.2v after, to the Si7006.  Given that this exceeds the 3.6v allowed amount, we shouldn't be shocked to see damage to the sensor.

Now, I've been using this exact scenario in my testing, with no ill effects so far.  My worry is if I start putting some boards down and into service, I'd hate to see them start dying off when it could have been prevented.  I understand prevention would be more guaranteed by running to an all 3.3v solution across the board, and I suppose that could be an option, but this seems to be just side stepping the purpose of a level shifter.

I work in NYC as an MEP Engineer. I've been doing this for over 5 years now, and have been at my current place of employ for over 4 years. The firm is an extremely small full service MEP shop, and the principal running it has been running this for over 20 years. 

I enjoy the work, but I've been struggling recently with motivation. You see, paychecks have been coming later and later. In 2016 I started tracking paycheck frequency. In2016, I was paid an average of 6.8 days late, with 3 paychecks on time.

2017 had an average of 12.7 days late with 1 on time.

2018 is much worse, averaging 21 days late with so far none on time.

Luckily, I also subscribe to /r/personalfinance , so I have a solid Emergency fund. I'm not hurting, by any means, but I need to carry a huge buffer in my checking account to weather the arrears. 



The only reason I haven't moved on yet is I am currently registered for the October PE Exam and didn't want to add job searching to my plate until that was away. On the other hand, I have received substantial raises since I first signed on, and there are other perks to working here, like the hours are decent, it's generally not a problem to take an extra day here or there, my boss is a pleasure to work with. 


I have lost my drive these past few months. I am wondering how typical this is in this field, if anyone has any advice, and any other thoughts or pieces of wisdom to share.

Let me preface this with some background. These are connecting rod bolts from a ~15 liter diesel engine. I am unsure of the material, but they conform to ASTM 568M, grade 12.9. I already know that they failed due to a single stress, greater than their ultimate strength. The way in which the engine failed, makes this the most likely failure. The piston seized in the bore while under load. Fracturing all 4 rod bolts, and ejecting the rod from the side of the block. I found both the cap and the bearing in relatively good condition, in the oil pan.  
&amp;nbsp;  
What is throwing me fore a loop, that I am struggling to get my head around. Is the mix of identifying characteristics of the failure. It has the dull, fibrous fracture face of a brittle fracture, but the bottlenecking of a ductile failure.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I am used to high grade, brittle bolts, failing with almost no necking around the fracture at all. Short of temperature, what would cause a brittle material to neck like this prior to fracture?

17,Mechanical Engineer who is Bad with design? (Poor short term memory and attention to detail),1536297216,"Hello all, I am a ME student who is wrapping up his first engineering experience (has been about 9 months so far). I have to say I've learned a lot about myself. I'm not as smart or as capable as I want to be. I'm good at math and physics but fall short when it comes to applying myself in the industry. 

I've recently come to believe this after comparing myself to peers in the past and present that did similar projects in similar roles. They seemed to accomplish 1.5x as much as I did. I'm not going to make excuses here. In the beginning of my internship, I had no idea what I was doing and I wasted a lot of time by not asking good enough questions. I basically didn't want to admit I didn't understand things because I didn't want to look stupid and waste my manager's time, so I said I understood then tried to ask other people or research things on the internet on my own. 

Then, in the halfway mark of my internship, I began to wake up. I became very assertive when I didn't understand things and hogged my manager's time until I understood things. I finally started to be able to know basic mechanical definitions, such as flat head screws, button head screw, torx screws, pitch, major diameter, etc. (yes I lacked even basic knowledge). Simply put, I've gotten a lot better, but I still suck. I triple and even quadruple check my engineering drawings and CAD assemblies, but there are things I still miss. In one particular case, I had gotten everything where I wanted regarding a by-pass guide, but forgot to account for the height of the product (the test products did not have caps on, but the real ones did which I didn't account for) so it hit the ceiling of the design. I was furious with myself.

The mistakes don't happen consistently but the only other mechanical engineering junior never makes the same mistakes. I feel like a failure. To make things worse, I use 3D Printing as a crutch and have to go through three 3D Printed iterations for each design before I get it just right. The other junior somehow gets the dimensions on his CAD assemblies right straight from measuring parts, never 3D Prints prototypes, yet still manages to get the final metal designs right. I haven't gotten a final metal part wrong, but I take a lot longer to finalize it. I ask him what his secret is and he says its measuring a lot. Fuck man, I do each dimension at least 5 times and I'm still not fully confident in my assembly. Especially when there are over 40 parts in my assembly and I have to design for tight tolerances (like within 0.25mm). Yet the other guys seems to have no problem with getting it right the first time. 

Another thing I've noticed about other mechanical engineering students is that when they are given instructions about a machine or process, they seem to be able to understand it instantly and remember all the steps. If I don't immediately start jotting notes, I forget things literally seconds after I hear them unless I am familiar with a system. Take 3D Printing for example; the subject matter expert shows the exact HMI command sequence to move the extruder head up 10mm. Normal engineering interns would memorize the command sequence the first time. I have to write it down and keep reading it until I memorize it, or take videos (not an option in highly regulated industries). This affects everything I do. 

My manager says I'm doing ""fine"". My project manager says I'm doing ""fine"". But is that just because I go out drinking with them on weekends? Sooner or later I'll end up missing a detail and invalidating a design and costing a company millions of dollars. It could be a thread pitch, a counter-bore distance, material choice, etc. I just feel like there are way too many variables to account for especially when moving parts are involved, and there are things constantly on my mind when designing components. I end up having to rush designs when deadlines come up, especially when I have multiple projects. I end up ""sending and praying"". 

That's not to say that I don't like mechanical design. I actually like it a lot. I find it very awarding when I come up with a solution that works despite the physical constraints to a design. I don't find measuring the position of 12 bolt holes in a 606mm radius huge rim plate tedious. In fact I enjoy getting my hands dirty, assembling/disassembling parts, testing prototypes, and coming up with creative solutions. The actual problem solving I have no problem with, I've impressed people with elegant designs. But the aforementioned 12 bolt holes in a 606mm radius plate? It takes me 3 iterations of 3D Printed Parts and a week to get them all right, and I know that I can't rely on 3D Printers forever because not every company has them. 

Tl;dr: I'm bad at paying attention to details and analyzing an entire assembly. I try to take a step back and look at the big picture, but when too many parts or variables get involved I end up getting overwhelmed and forget to account for small yet really important details, which makes my designs useless. My short term memory is horrid, which contributes to this problem. If something isn't written down, I forget about it immediately. And if I start having pages and pages of notes, I will definitely miss something.

So, is there any hope for me in improving and what can I do to improve? I put a lot of effort in trying to improve and take criticisms seriously, but I have the feeling that I'm just not suited for design. It's not that I'm not willing to work hard. I try to be as careful as I can be. But I'm still making unacceptable mistakes and I'm starting to think I don't have the aptitude. 

If my flaws make me unsuited for design, then what other options are available for a mechanical engineer? I did very well in school and I enjoy thinking about abstract concepts. I think coding might be better for me because I can keep multiple backups (in case I fuck up) and run test codes easily (it's not as easy to test physical prototypes in heavily regulated industries). I took an MBTI test and I got a result which is INTP, meaning that I am scatter-brained and not good with sensory information. 

Sorry with the long blurb, I just feel lost and going through an existential crisis. I've always wanted to be a good engineer but maybe it is not meant to be. ",AskEngineers,False,Aishita,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9dr4k3/mechanical_engineer_who_is_bad_with_design_poor/
18,Question on thread depth and truncation.,1536293040,"I'm trying to model a 5/8""-24 external and internal thread in Solidworks. When drawing out the cutting tool as a triangle to sweep along a helix, I'm obviously forced to go down the giant rabbit hole of thread standards (learning a lot). 


One thing that's stumping me: calculating the depth of the thread. According to this quote on the wiki about screw threads (link [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_thread)), ""Major diameter minus minor diameter, divided by two, equals the height of the thread."" [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_thread#/media/File:Thread_Profile_Diameters.jpg) an accompanying image. This makes sense to me. 

On the other hand, thread depth is also defined as in the same wiki page: ""A perfectly sharp 60° V-thread will have a depth of thread (""height"" from root to crest) equal to 0.866 of the pitch."" This also makes sense to me. 

So when looking at the first definition and [this](https://www.physics.wisc.edu/ishop/tapdrillchart.html) tap and drill chart, I get (0.625-.5739)/2 = .02555in for height of thread. Using the second defintion, I get 0.866*.04167 = .03608in for depth of sharp-V thread. 

Why are these two numbers not the same? My hunch is it has something to do with truncation. I know the second definition is for a theoretical sharp-V thread which isn't typically used in reality. Does this mean the minor diameter in the tap and drill chart takes into account some sort of truncation? Am I overthinking this, or misunderstanding the definitions of these terms? Thanks to anyone who has read this far, any help in clarifying this would greatly be appreciated.

21,What is the difference between US car 'fuels' and European car 'fuels'?,1536272980,"Hello! I hope this is alright to post here. First time here. 

So. I enjoy watching youtube videos about engineering, and car engines. I myself am a maritime engineer, so I know more about ship diesel engines than car engines. One youtube channel I enjoy a lot is run by an american, so most of the times his videos are american orientated. Fine by me, but I dont understand certain things when he is talking about fuel.

I often hear 80 octane gas, 87 octane, etc. In Europe, we have LPG (which is the actual gas), petrol and diesel. Petrol can be found in 92 (eastern parts of Europe mostly, dont know about the south though), 95 (the standard where I'm from) and the ''premium'' 98.

25,Why are Sunlight Viewable LCDs rare and expensive?,1536268799,"It seems the most common solution to making an LCD easy to see in sunlight is to crank the LED backlight up to 11. In fact I had to modify an LCD backlight driver on my drone to manage my FPV setup. Also most phones seem to implement this method, but to me it seems rather nieve. Besides obvious energy constraints on mobile devices, your killing the LEDs! Especially in the case of OLED panels where burn in is still an issue.

My old flip mino camcorder from like 2008 had what I can only describe as a _transreflective_ LCD. It had a 'grey' appearance when off, but the display seemed to be capible of utilizing bright external light. Since it remained usable _even at minimum brightness_ outdoors. Why has industry moved away from this technology?  That particular display didn't offer the best contrast or color gamut, but it was on par with other LCDs in that time frame...

26,"People who work in sales engineering/technical sales: what type of sales are you in, and are you happy?",1536267476,"I'm a recent ChemE graduate. Strong background in bio science electives, was going to work in biotech/process development but really wanted a more extrovert friendly career. Worked at a few start ups, left to pursue a career in technical sales. Got a job with a water treatment company selling chemical products/equipment (boiler, chiller, tower, RO membrane treatment). There are things I like and things that I don't. The pay potential is really good (already making $70k with 10k car allowance and I'm just a service tech learning, average rep makes $100k-$200k). The company and business are stable, every industry has to treat their water. There's a lot of autonomy, no one breathing down my neck to put in 40 hours as long as the work gets done. I get to meet new people all the time, drive around, chat away.

One downside is sometimes I feel like I could be doing something a little more technically challenging. Something a little more respectable. A lot of the guys I work with either don't have degrees (older generation, grandfathered in), or their degrees are all over the place (geology, chemE, biology, business with the right training).

27,Thinking about trying to build a solenoid engine that doesn't suck?,1536265802,"So I recently got a job as a process engineer at a factory that makes solenoids for car engines. I'm up to my ears in reject solenoids that will otherwise just go in the scrap bin, and it got me thinking about fun things to do with them. Now, these solenoids aren't really good for anything like a solenoid engine, so I'll probably wind my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked up solenoid engines, but they all seem to be universally terrible, and I hate building desk toys that can't do real work. So I started thinking about what makes these different from a regular electric motor. If you take a brushless motor (which are normally quite efficient and high power/size), and break it down, eventually you get to an iron core electromagnet and one to two permenant magnets (depending on the point in time) that pass by the end of the iron core horizontally. The iron core is magnetized, attracting one of the magnets and repelling the other one. The repelled magnet leaves the influence of the electromagnet, and the attracted magnet comes right up to the end of the core, at which point the polarity switches (ideally).

&amp;#x200B;

So, based on that, the main problem with your average solenoid engine is that there are no magnets, and the coil is only doing single duty in attracting metal towards it, with no repulsion. Otherwise, I don't see a difference between the magnets moving perpendicularly past the end of the core, and say, a magnet on each end of the core moving linearly  directly towards and away from the core. Can anyone confirm these observations?

&amp;#x200B;

In that case, I can design my solenoid engine like a brushless dc motor. [I found lots of information about building your own brushless motors.](https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Own-Miniature-Electric-Hub-Motor/) Using a solid rod as the core of my coils, does it make a big difference if I have a magnet on each side, pushing one and pulling the other at the same time, versus just one magnet on one side?

53,Injection Molding Process Engineer (entry level),1536207456,"Hi Reddit,

I am relatively recent graduate Chemical Engineer and have accepted position as Process Engineer 1 with plastic injection molding company. Chemical industry (pharma, fine chemicals, oil and gas) is shit in this location but injection molding has good presence so I thought this would be good move; I can’t really relocate for reasons. 

I have three years experience as Technician in chemical purification, but fluid handling/engineering is very different than primarily mechanical processes of injection molding. My manager was interested in my skills and abilities in understanding chemical reactivities and materials compatibilities, also rheological properties of fluids. 

I’m so in over my head right now. PIM machines aren’t anything at all like what I’ve had hands on in school (unit ops) nor in my chemical job. Effective injection molding seems almost more art or trade than science; or so Senior Process Engineer makes it seem. Yes pressure, temperature, and numerous parameters are “tuned” for part, mold, material, etc. but I can’t seem to wrap my head around what parameters are changed when, and for what reason. And Senior Process Engineer who’s been here for 49 years has too much going on to explain to me other than curt explanations and snarky comments like “you are Chemical Engineer, so figure it out.” Just to mention he is old-school non-degree’d worked his way up from the trenches Rngineer (nothing wrong with that.)

I’m three months in and have no freaking clue what I’m supposed to be doing. I honestly think they hired me because I’m willing to do some of supervisory and numbersy tasks that other engineers don’t want, for example: 

Some of my responsibilities from job description are: 
-	statistical process control
-	enterprise resource planning
-	developing and auditing standard work procedures
-	and 7-10 operators and technicians that report to me (on paper, but it’s plainly apparent that real unit leader is Senior Engineer. I don’t report to him; he and I both report to Engineering Manager.)
-	continuous improvement projects
-	machine setup and optimization
-	machine operation and troubleshooting

I’m not even sure what I’m asking here. Just for some advice; please don’t tell me to quit and relocate-that is not a option. I do enjoy plastic molding; I just want to understand better and be good engineer. Maybe some resources for learning engineering side of injection molding.

71,Training People On CFD Simulation,1536170475," My current company has hit the point where I have too many priority projects to do them all and hit the deadlines expected, so they have asked me to make an in-house training course from my boss and another engineer to do CFD simulations. They will primarily use SolidWorks Flow simulation, but may use ANSYS down the line.

My question for you all is, have you had to do similar, and what did you do to train them? I have done seminars and technical presentations to the company before, but never set up a training curriculum for people to be able to effectively take on my work. The baseline they are looking for is for my boss and the other engineer to be able to do lower level work within 3 weeks.

My other concern is more of one on job security. My boss has always held an interest in CFD, but never actually pursued it until recently. The other engineer I am teaching is a fresh graduate. I am concerned they may be aiming to have me train my replacement in the long run, say 6 months. I am one of the higher paid engineers because I do all of the simulations (CFD/FEA/plastic molding, etc).

He explained that it's basically a cover up for quality, since a quality thing should never break, therefore there's no need for a warranty. Whereas something cheap might break a lot, so to get you to buy it, despite it being of lower quality, they add a very generous warranty. 

In my mind I instinctively disagree with this idea, since it's not the best idea businesswise to be on the hook for something that you know is going to break, especially as time goes on something is guarenteed to fail eventually.

74,High Voltage transmission lines - E Field,1536162183,"So I've for some reason gotten interested in the different ways one could get electrocuted. It seems that in many places on the web that there is controversy whether throwing a toaster in the tub will electrocute you. I'm satisfied with the answer ""probably."" Another instance is swimming during a thunderstorm. The current actually travels on the surface of the water, but the chances of you being submerged when lightning strikes is pretty low, and the energy of a lightning strike is enough to sublimate many solids.

An interesting case is of 3 phase high voltage power lines. This guy goes in to depth on the subject here: http://thefragmentationparadox.blogspot.com/2014/03/electromagnetic-fields-emf-in-high_16.html

Towards the bottom of the page, he's animated (with Matlab) the voltage field around the transmission towers for all the moments within one cycle of the arrangement of cables carrying 50Hz  400kV with 1200MVA power. If you notice, there's a very small ball of very little voltage (nearly 0) that travels from right to left through a very high voltage area (15kV/meter). If that ball were to pass through you, what in the world would that be like (assuming you're just floating there)? Is that just a small static shock or would it at least feel weird? I guess that would cause current to flow from one side of your body to the other as the voltage sink repeatedly travels from right to left 50 times a second. Could it kill you?

I'm sure there's no lacking in ways to get yourself fried on high voltage transmission lines, but I was just curious what the community might think of this interesting phenomenon and maybe share some of the practicalities of linemen working on these things (if that's even something to be expected of a lineman).",AskEngineers,False,sandman18and5,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9d7quu/high_voltage_transmission_lines_e_field/

Materials- I want my students to design the majority of the limb themselves, and gather their own materials. Are there any suggestions of materials I can suggest to them or are there any materials I can get in bulk for them to use for their’s?

Testing- Each project is assessed to see if it “completes the goal” or “addresses the need”. Are there any suggestions for how I could test the arms and assess their functionality?

My only thought of a test is to give each group 3-4 types of objects they would need to pick up in a certain amount of time. If they pick up the item within the time limit, they move up one grade level. Any other suggestions or feedback?

Blueprinting/CAD- I do not have much experience with either of these, so I feel uncomfortable teaching it. Are there any suggestions on how to teach them these skills when planning their prosthetic?

I graduated from a major Texas college with a degree in mech engineering in the spring of 2017.  I had a low GPA, think 2.2-2.3 (I understood the material but engineering homework is a... group effort).  I focused mainly on programming, CFD, solidworks, and FEA.  I was gearing towards simulation.  My senior design project dealt with carbon fiber layup which was cool, but it was a university club project so it didn't really get exposure.  Also that club sucked so the final product didn't even make it to competition.

I wasn't able to get an internship while in school, and upon graduating I couldn't find work for a few months, but finally landed a gig at a product design company where I was the only employee, and the owner was a clueless dude.  I made $16.50 an hour.  He was struggling to find work for me to do and ended up cutting me after 3 months.  Then I worked as a button presser for a tech company where I had good pay but ended up having to leave for work/life balance a few weeks ago.

I had two kids while in school so I was never able to really devote my time to going greek or networking with clubs.  I got an alternate teaching cert and finding a teaching job has been difficult with an engineering degree.  I get a lot of ""you have an engineering degree, why would you want to work here????""

I'm frustrated from not being able to find a $40k a year job with an engineering degree.

The HR person was nicely dressed and other people that should be my bosses (and working in my future department) showed up in a polo shirts from company. 

Also I need to travel with a bus pretty long distance to there and I have no place to put suit even if I had one. 

So here's the question: ""What would you do in my situation and how would you act?"". Please have on mind that my plan was to dress the same white shirt with the tie and nice blue pants with nice black shoes. If you have something to add, every response is more than welcome and I'll be more than happy to hear some other points of view.

It's an interview for a real job after postgraduate (master) studies not internship.

And this is a similar question. When a car isn’t strong enough to pull something and the tires are still but the engine is still working what is taking this energy?

From my research I see “glue dots” as an option, but I’m scared this will be too much like the ones used for credit cards and the like, and I don’t want such a thick layer between the plastic part and the metal part. Less than 1mm of glue thickness or as minimal as possible is ideal. I also don’t know if this is ideal for metals on plastic or if it’ll even work. It does need to stay on pretty firmly.

6,Vibratory screen sorting in micro-scale a.k.a. the salt shaker,1536079062,"How would you go about designing the perfect salt shaker lid / screen ?

Can you extrapolate industrial screen sorting machines to a small salt shaker ? 



This is where i am now:

The lid with the screen: https://i.imgur.com/HOn2yfa.png

The whole thing:https://i.imgur.com/z2ltKlO.png

I'm only software engineer, making physical objects is only a hobby for me.

So my Mom had this salt shaker that she used for cooking for the last 20 years or so, and it broke.

Having access to a cnc machine i made a new one, but it has a major problem, it does dispense pretty much the exact same amount of salt as the old one did, but it requires much more force, and the force must be applied along the cylinder axis, vigorously.

Both salt shakers are cylinders, roughly 150mm ( ~6inch ) tall and 50mm ( ~2inch ) in diameter. The lid is the top of the cylinder, and consists of two discs one stationary, one free to rotate, stationary one has and off center hole 12mm in diameter, and the second one is as in the drawing.

You adjust amount of disposed salt by aligning the rotary disc with the stationary disc hole.

Old shaker was working best, when the lid was on the top, and you would grab it with your thumb up tilt roughly 100deg, and use your index finger to tap it lightly.

The new one, in order to dispose salt at all, with the lid at the top must be grabbed thumb down, rotated 180deg, and shaken with the whole wrist along the axis of the cylinder. This is quite awkward to do and uncomfortable.

Current lid design assumes the grain of salt is on average 0.3 mm in diameter. The lid is made of acrylic sheet, 4mm thick. Screen is made by drilling a pattern of 1mm holes, 1.5mm apart ( center to center ) in a rectangular pattern contained in a 12mm circle. The 1mm holes are chamfered 45deg such that the length of the hole is about 2.5mm, making a grid of holes 2.5mm deep and 1mm in diameter for the salt grains to squeeze trough. The chamfer is on the outside.

**The main question is:**

Assuming i want the salt shaker to be used as the old one, with the lid on the top, grabbed with the thumb up, tilted roughly 100-120deg, and tapped with the index finger to the cylinder edge,

Which variables influence the force required to dispense the salt the most?
How would i go about decreasing the required force ?

Please keep in mind, that the salt is not supposed to *flow* freely without tapping.

12,Structural welding: what grade of threaded rod for securing timber post to weld plate?,1536073459,"Two  years ago I had a 14'x17' floating slab  poured and included four 1'x1'  1/4"" weld plates anchored at the corners; in a few  weeks time I have a  timberframe gazebo being installed.

The 7"" square legs will be bored &amp; dropped over 12""x 3/4"" threaded rod and tightened down though an access hole in one face.

I plan on bringing in a JM welder and his truck to do the welding; I  have three mig and tig machines but I'm not a welder,  and  I want this done stick; I have a technical background and, to me,   structural welds should be stick: softer with some flex, less brittle  than mig.

My question is: what grade of   threaded rod? The builder dropped off plated G5  rod &amp; nuts  (he's used to having them anchored in concrete), but  I'm concerned  about contaminating the weld with the cad/zinc plating.  The wind here  can get upwards of 50mph, and with only 4 rods  securing the structure, I  want to make sure these connections are as  strong as possible. The  timberframe construction is mortise &amp; tenon, so I'm not concerned  about twisting or racking. Also; I'm rural and the county doesn't require a permit.

I looked at black ready rod but it's G2. Stainless is available and I'm prepared to go that route.

The plan is to tack/ weld out 3/4"" hex nuts to the weld plates, insert the ready rods and weld out the joints.

Any  other insights would be appreciated, as in preheat, what rod etc., but  in the end I'll have to go with whatever the JM welder considers best.  However, I need to have the threaded rod on site.

14,"Petty neighbor vs. petty me: War over my beloved tomato, need reddit-help for protecting my tomato",1536072043,"TL;DR: I'm looking for a simple solution that will make it 'impossible' to rip [a tomato](https://i.imgur.com/vshQpm0.jpg) out of the ground. Anything besides landmines is okay. 

_______

######The ~~battle~~playingfield: 
A big city courtyard. Some plants are in a sad patch of dirt we call garden, it's for everyone. In the middle, there's more than enough empty space for a tomato. 

######The Backstory: 
I have a few tomatoes, in pots. Someone suggested I plant one in the garden, I did. With a strong bamboo stick which I hammered .5m into the ground, and tied the tomato to it nicely. It was a good tomato and I grew it from a single seed. One neighbor ripped it out at night, and the stick too. The guy is ~80 and thinks he owns the yard, he also reads peoples letters in the trash. Think napoleon-complex meets retirements meets binoculars. He put the stick in the ground and tied his beans to it. I think those of you who are still reading get why this isn't something I will bother my landlord with but instead want a solution that will make him suffer.

I planted the next tomato, he ripped it out again. Repeat until 1 tomato left. Please reddit, the last tomato is named *Trotzki*, please help me save him. He needs to be planted because the pot is too small, but the yard out there is certain death:

Whatever I plant next, he will watch me plant it from his flat and the same night, try to rip out again. He's been watching how the tomatoes on my window have been decimated, one after the other gets planted, there's only Trotzki left on my window, then that's it. This is what he lives for, watching people, criticizing people, destroying peoples tomatoes. I want him to try **AND FAIL**. I want him to work hours and hours trying to remove the next tomato and give up in defeat. I want to break his spirit like he broke my tomatoes little stems. 



######What I need help for: 

The most direct idea so far is to hammer a stick in the ground so securely he can't get it out ever again. Something with barbed hooks that can only go deeper into the ground. Or cement it in, or similar. If someone has a simple, quick and indestructible solution for that, I think it might work. I'll plant a decoy-tomato next to it, he'll rip out the tomato, then try the stick, and fail. Then, when he's gone through the sages of grief, I plant the real tomato and tie it to the stick. 

######Other ideas: 

Any other ideas that will defeat the neighbor are okay. If one of you has access to a hitman, affordable security personell, heck even a precise drone strike,  I'm fine with that. I'm budget constrained though, and all of this needs to be a) under the landlords radar, and b) free of civilian casualties.

######facts: 

- I'm willing to put in one whole nights work and $50 in material.

- I have a hardware store 30min from me, no car though. 

- the dirt in the yard (surface) is soft, low nutritioun, garbage. The tomato needs to root downwards to get to proper dirt. 

- Trotzki is a healthy tomato, and about to sprout more stems once planted

- my neighbor is a class 1 asshole and there's no discussion to be had about morality here, this is full blown war against a terrorist who commits atrocities. Still protected by the Geneva convention though. 

- The tomato needs to be planted asap, the pot it's in is too small and it needs more dirt.

They come in at a stack of 300 sheets, and our mechanism picks them up one by one, and transfers them into the press. If double sheet is transferred into press accidentally, it will cause downtime, and bunch of press problems. Sheets are picked up by rubber suction cups and are moving on multiple rubber belts, so they are totally isolated from any external metal connection. I am thinking to measure up the resistance of a single sheet between 2 set points. Once I have empirical data, I want to design  a set of antennas between the belts which would come into an instant contact with sheets as soon as sheets are lifted up.   There is oil film between the sheets on the stack. So double sheet resistance would be different every time, as the oil distribution is not consistent throughout the sheet surface and contact area changes at each scenario. However, I don't think there would be too much deviation for resistance of a single stack. Therefore, in my PLC code, I can say if the value=! x value, that means we have a problem there.

58,Home electrical: Is my service panel properly bonded/grounded?,1535981202,"I very recently moved into a 1920s-build house. The electrical appears to have largely been upgraded (Loomex/Romex throughout), but the service panel is a fairly old and obsolete [Sylvania-GTE 100 amp fuse box](https://i.imgur.com/aCiWVpD.jpg) (yes, I do plan on upgrading it to a 200 amp breaker box ASAP).

Yesterday I [opened up the panel](https://i.imgur.com/ZDOXW5N.jpg) to wire a new dedicated circuit for a dishwasher and noticed a few peculiarities that I would really appreciate help with.

Most notably, the [neutral](https://i.imgur.com/N2iptR5.jpg) and ground bars [right bar](https://i.imgur.com/QPNFyoU.jpg), [left bar](https://i.imgur.com/wnmhNyd.jpg) are separate, and *do not appear to be bonded* (i.e., there are no jumpers between the ground and neutral bars, as far as I can see). 

My understanding is that this is a potentially dangerous and non-compliant situation. Am I missing something here, or **am I correct that these aren't bonded and therefore the system isn't properly grounded?** Does the panel case itself serve as a jumper between them (that would be weird, right?), or could there be a jumper strap behind the case that I'm not seeing?

Another peculiarity is that I noticed a [thick black cable](https://i.imgur.com/Fp0sr8C.jpg) dangling beside the (apparently recently upgraded from lead) water service. This cable emerges from the top of the fuse box, so I think it's a grounding wire. There is also a [half-attached jumper spanning the water meter.](https://i.imgur.com/KTy26lK.jpg) Seems to me that the plumbing is not properly grounded, presenting a potential hazard if any line ever becomes energized. This is obviously an easy fix, but **would there be any valid reason why this may have been left unattached?**

To start I will specify the factors I've been working with so far:

I've chosen a vertical axis design because from what I've gathered it's a better fit for smaller scale applications and high turbulance areas, it's location is a cabin in a clearing of woods. The average wind speed for the area my turbine will be designed for is 4-5 m/s. The design of the turbine is not finished yet, but I desire high starting torque as I'm under the impression that will give me more consistent performance in low speed wind. To achieve this high torque in the simplest and cheapest way I've come up with, the turbine will be Double Rotor Savonius with one fin to slightly increase it's inherent low efficiency. I lack in understanding of turbine design, I don't know what measurements I need to take to determine tip speed ratios or even RPM. Any advice in this area is greatly appreciated.

The other component to this project of mine is the generator. This has been my main focus in my research and I'm confident in my ability to fabricate the neccesary parts but I still need to iron out several details, especially for safety precautions. The design is based around ""Axial flux alternators"" as I've seen them called, though I'm not certain if that is the correct term. My stator will consist of 9 coils in 3 phases wired in series. The coils will be wound with 20 gauge enameled wire reclaimed from motors. The permanent magnet rotor will have 12 1""×1/2""×1/8"" rectangular neodymium magnets with an individual gauss rating of 13800. I desire a 14v output at average wind speeds for charging a 12v battery, from what I've gathered I need to use Faraday's Law to determine how many turns are neccesary in my coils for 14v output at a given RPM. I plugged in 300 RPM and my wire diameter, magnet area and tesla rating and got ~116 turns per coil, does that seem fairly accurate or is there something I missed? I can link to the website I found the info on Faraday's Law if anyone is interested. 

Finally I want to address how to handle the voltage generated safely and simply. I know my alternator will produce 3 phase ac that needs to be rectified into dc before connecting to a charge controller. I also know that I need some form of dump load for high wattage from excessive RPM in the case of extreme wind. 

As far as progress so far, Ive ordered the magnets and epoxy resin for fabricating the generator and they should arrive this week. I plan to start winding the coils in the next couple days and hope to have a working prototype for testing in a week or two. I haven't started any work on the turbine itself but I know I want it to be roughly 4'x4' and 25' in height. Also I need to get my wiring completely figured out so I know what components to order, so far I know I need a full bridge rectifyer, ~500w resistor for a dump load, and some kind of charge controller. Also I'm not sure where the dump load gets wired into the circuit.

To conclude I want to state that this is just a fun passion project based on a newfound interest in electricity and surplus of free copper in my life. I will post updates as I complete different stages of the design if anyone would like to see how it turns out. Any tips or information regarding the different formulas and variables I've failed to address will make me happy.

Some background:

I have a B.S. in physics and a M.S in Mech. Engineering with an aerospace-heavy thesis (my university didn't have an official Aero dept, but many professors and grad students do work relavent to the industry)

Current situation:

I've been working at a government facility as a contractor for \~8 months doing Aerospace Engineering . My managers want to bring me as a full time salaried employee, but I have a feeling my pay will be significantly reduced (probably much more than the worth of the added benefits). My initial pay was higher (I think) than average because my managers reaaallly needed to fill the position and didn't have another canditate, and knew I'd have a hard time saying no to the hourly rate they offered. That, and my resume was found by a subcontractor of the contractor who fought for an hourly rate that basically would help me up and move \~1000 miles of the blue and comfortably pay for any lease contracts I was still under. This was a straight hourly pay, not a per diem which is often given for those types of situations.

What I think I deserve:

I don't want to use actual amounts, but the ratios are accurate, lets just say they are currently paying me an hourly equivalent of 36.5 dollars/year, and I would like 31 dollars + benefits which is what I'm worth (according to glassdoor and other sites) and with standard benefits is almost exactly 36.5 total compensation value.

What I think they'll offer:

I have a feeling they might offer between 25.3 and 28.7 $/year, which is less than the average Aero salary for the area /  someone with my experience. Not sure why exaclty they pay less, maybe because the company is new to the aero industry?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Regarding my negotiating power,

Pros:

Filled a position they struggled for months to fill, and will fill a similar position on another project if I stay with them

Received written commendations from customer for exceptional work

Cons:

Would have a hard time finding a better work environment in terms of the people, and day to day work (I realize this is a total pro in terms of quality of life, just not one for negotiating since they know I'll probably stay even if they give me less than I ask for)

Already settled in my apartment/area and wouldn't want to move.

&amp;#x200B;

So what should I do? ask for more than 31 in hopes of getting closer to 31, or just ask for 31 since it's almost certainly more than they will offer anyways? If you made it all the way through this post I thank you very much!

Also is there a specific technique used for controlling the power supply via microcontroller?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking this question here to know if anyone as any suggestion on how to tackle the problem mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently trying to simplify the plies resulting from a composite structural optimization for my master thesis and the results are nowhere near manufacturable.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've tried the options in Hyperworks (the software I'm using) but I don't like the end results ...

I've asked around and people tell me they do it manually but I think there must be a better method that updating the shape of hundreds of plies manually.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm trying a programming approach with MATLAB. From the .fem file I imported the nodes coordinates, the elements and the sets (the sets are the shape of the plies). After this an algorithm will try to simplify their shape but I think this method will take a while until it is perfected.

90,New MEng in Software Engineering 12-month program at my university: honest critique and analysis needed.,1535873650,"[Here's the new program in question. You can look at the curriculum and general outline in the brochure and FAQ (for engineering graduates without a software background).](https://go.ucalgary.ca/Engineer_a_new_software_career.html?hootPostID=ce066f8b4aab2980c810c3fd8082889b&amp;aliId=68613797#Quick-Self-Assessment)

I graduated in mechanical engineering (with a minor in mechatronics) last summer and I've come to realize that I want to transition into software engineering, notably blockchain development but I'm not too picky about a niche at this point. If I were to be perfectly frank, I picked the wrong major out of immaturity. Mech had the highest entrance GPA at the end of first year (I had a really strong GPA) so I picked that even though I knew my heart belonged in ECE. I thought my minor in mechatronics would make me feel better but it just made feel worse, this definitely isn't my passion. 

I had a 16-month internship with a big EPCM firm in the HVAC industry a couple years ago which I really didn't like. Over the last year, I haven't been able to find work but I also haven't looked very hard because I've been taking some time off travelling (and I got lucky making a decent amount of income via cryptocurrency which was enough for living costs).

From a cursory glance, this program looks perfect for my specific situation. I can make a full transition from mechanical to software engineering in just a year while actually upgrading my degree to a higher level (I've applied for a computer science after-degree program and BSc. in software engineering but didn't get in because of extremely high demand even though I had a superb GPA). In terms of curriculum and courses, it looks like it'll be pretty rushed and it seems that the learning will be generalized in nature, which is to be expected given the time-frame and non-software background. The first 4 months are bootcamp-style intro to programming, then you pick selected courses for the next two semesters.

This program was just announced on the 16th of August so I quickly applied and I got admission. Class sizes are around 40 people. There's a 4-hour long orientation seminar next week that will explain the general outline and how to succeed in this program so I'll have more details by Tuesday evening. I also received a scholarship which essentially makes this degree negligible in costs financially speaking. At this point, I'd rather go back to school and switch fields/learn something new then spend more time job hunting in this abysmal economy (Canada).

**My primary concern as a graduate from this program is how will employers view me as a candidate compared to graduates who spend four years with a computer science or software engineering undergraduate degree?** I still think this is a step in the right direction for me but I might just be biased. Demand is high in software right now (especially blockchain) and this program should get the ball rolling for me.

Anyway, that was quite the ramble. I'd like to hear some honest critique and analysis on this program. Any insight is welcomed.

I have a place to start a MEng Mechanical Engineering course this month, at a university that’s ranked in the world top 20 on its own, but is outside the top 100 in the MechEng department (UCL). 

In the past few weeks I’ve realised that Materials Science really appears to me as a subject, more so than MechEng ever did. I have the grades to take a year out and reapply to a university that has an even better ranking on its own, and is within the top 10-15 in both MechEng and MatSci (Imperial). 

But I’ve heard that MatSci has narrower job prospects than MechEng, even if MatSci is supposed to be a “growing field”. Looking at Imperial’s graduate figures, most people that don’t go into further study seem to just go into finance, which I guess is both comforting in that there’s still a job market out there if I decide a PhD isn’t for me, and scary in that I actually need a PhD to do anything in the field that interests me, which is R&amp;D.

I could technically apply to MechEng at Imperial, but I already applied there last time round, and I got rejected at the interview stage, so I’m not enthusiastic about this option. 

So my question is, is it worth ditching a MechEng degree at a “good” university for a shot at a Matsci degree at a “great” one (emphasis on “a shot”, since there’s still every chance I could bomb this interview too)?

So instead of getting stressed working desk jobs, I thought maybe getting a tech job(which I think is more fulfilling and practical) and ultimately immigrating to Canada, Australia, etc would be a better idea. I'm thinking of going to a company, that would accept begginers regardless of degrees or experience first and came up with these lists:

1. Packaging equipment(Injection molding &amp; blowing equipment from Germany, Switzerland) installing and servicing company. Opportunity for equipment training abroad later.
2. Industrial de-humidifier installing and servicing company, keyword being automation control, HVAC, PLC, HMI programming and instrument commissioning. Doesn't have to be full time, can go to night school if I want.
3.  Construction machinery(Bridge construction, bearing, concrete &amp; asphalt paving, etc) sales company. Company is nearest out of the three.

I would be grateful what option would be the best. 

Currently leaning towards 2 or 1. 2 because I can take onlince course in engineering so I'm not totally ignorant in the theory side and 1 because they seem to be very eager on training novices. Preferably, I'd want to get as well rounded technician as possible and be ready for immigration abroad.

26,Capital Project Work Flow,1535729025,"Hello, Reddit Engineers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am an engineering student (still in my sophomore year, working towards my associates) , but I also work as an electrical technician in a manufacturing facility. This facility is mostly run by Austrians. All of the top members of the engineering department are Austrian, so I don't feel as though I am getting an accurate impression of how project work flow is supposed to work in the American corporate world. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, we are installing several small office trailers that are meant to house several workers in our shipping department. The electrical engineer (who is no older than me) is designing this project on the fly and literally making drawings on pieces of printer paper. I have asked repeatedly about permits, stamped drawings, etc... but have yet to see anything. I have been tasked with trying to calculate the necessary service size, conduit size, and order the parts. I have explained that I have no idea where to start without a drawing. I have finally got him talked into proceeding in one of three ways: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Hiring an American Project Engineer (or licensed electrical contractor) who is familiar with American building codes (Florida building code, NEC, etc...) and hiring him to handle these projects. I figured that someone with this background would be able to handle the paper work side of things (securing drawings, getting them approved, procuring parts, permits, etc...) and our electrical department could do the work. 
2. Having an engineering firm do drawings and calculations for us and we would proceed with the installation on our own. 
3. Having a contractor do the installation and let them worry about drawings, calculations, permits, etc...

My question is, out of those three options, which one sounds like the normal method of doing capital projects at a manufacturing facility? If this were a project on the machine side, I would have no qualms about us doing the design and installation all in house, because that is our area of specialty. We are familiar with the NEC as it applies to motors, motor control centers, and the like. However, this is an infrastructure project, and building codes are not my area of expertise (nor my chosen career path). I just want some insight into what is considered standard operating procedure. 

&amp;#x200B;

27,Doing the work of an EE without the compensation. No Degree,1535727597," 

I've been working in the field of automation controls for 3 years. I started with this company building control panels and assembling proprietary ANDON devices. They have encouraged me to advance my skills in ever aspect of my job. Programming PLCs, creating electrical schematics, designing control panels, site surveys, quoting jobs, debugging control systems, installing control system and basically everything the Electrical Engineers (EE) do at this company.

I am completely self taught when it comes to electronics and programming. I am very knowledgeable of most electrical systems when it comes to automation controls and had a good base of electrical knowledge before I even began. (Did a lot with programming microcontrollers and made my own synthesizers/circuit bending old keyboards) I have no degree in EE but I see a lot of new guys starting here fresh out of college with an EE BA and they don't know their ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to automation controls.

I've worked very hard to get where I am at and I still make half of what these new engineers make when they start out. Hell, even the interns make slightly more than me. I've taught a lot of them the ins and outs of our drawing standards, PLC programming and system design. I don't mind doing this as it reinforces my own knowledge.

My issue here is compensation. I do everything the Engineers here do. So why does my boss refuse to see me as the Engineers equal? Because I don't have a degree? I've asked for equal compensation and he's denied me because I don't have the degree and I refuse to waste my time and money receiving a worthless EE degree when I already have the knowledge to excel at my career. Is it ethical for an employer to do this? I do the same work for half the pay and I'm beginning to resent this whole place.

If I was looking for a different job how can I market myself without the degree?

Should I just get the degree?

34,"As an adult doing ""paraengineering"" in industry with the desire to finish college: how do I quanitize schooling as an investment?",1535690778,"Like the title but in more detail: 

I'm a 28 yo single male with a fairly solid electrical and mechanical maintenance, fabrication, and design resume in industries around my area. For the last year or two, I've been focused on going to school for EE or ME (I'll have to pick in a term or two, but have pretty much maximized the time before deciding on a major) while managing maintenance (3 person team, communicating production down time, etc.) and systems integration (designing, programming, and troubleshooting process lines) at a food production plant. In April I quit my job to focus on a very loaded term. 

After summer school, I talked to a recruiter looking for a short term summer job. I got a great offer at a large machine shop being groomed for department management (less than a year until the the guy retires) with plenty of opportunity to continue to diversify into electrical design, PLC programming, mech design, etc. It seems like a really good company and a few industry friends have recommended it. 

Since I'm still working through the recruiter, I'm currently making 70k/year, but I will definitely get a raise in 6 weeks and should get more fairly quickly thereafter. I think 90k in the next year is reasonable. 

I like working in a machine shop, having free access to lathes and mills, but I feel like I'm a glorified mechanic with a lot of promises dangled in front of my head. I enjoy the work environment, but that might just exaggerated be because it's very new and I have a boner for machine shops and heavy industry. 

I like going to school too, but a series of poorly timed setbacks have left me broke- too broke to just do school + work study for fall term. I got a small scholarship (~1/2 of tuition), but the time I would need to pay for the rest of school makes it not worth taking. I qualified for almost no student loans, I think I'm above whatever bracket they set. I'm uncomfortable in debt anyway, having seen it ruin lives around me since the recession. 

So: Should I take the fall term off? Should I just work for a year, save, and try to pay for school more or less out of pocket? 


TLDR: 

How would one ideally model income when deciding whether or not to go back to school? As a function of salary? What would appropriate growing salaries be for an ee out of college but with experience be for the first 10 yeats? Should I just bake calculations on savings? 

My ideal would be to maximize spending about 12 years out, do the house, wife, and kids thing, and still have money to swing around at interesting industries thereafter.

If my math is correct, the driven gear (50 tooth) should spin twice as fast when using the 10 tooth gear to drive it. However, what I'm seeing (visually, as I don't have any speed sensor) is that the 5 tooth gear spins the 50 tooth noticeably faster. How much faster I can't reliably say but it is visually faster.

38,Recent Engineering Grad: Pursue a career in academia now or gain more industry experience first?,1535685399,"I am in my 20s and have a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I have about 3 years of experience, 1.5 at a small manufacturing facility and 1.5 in HVAC/MEP. I didn’t like working in HVAC/MEP, so I quit the job to try and grow my small freelance CAD and 3D printing business while exploring other options. I’ve always wanted to teach engineering and it’s been on the back-burner as a long-term option, which is why I was pretty stoked that I got an adjunct position teaching engineering/CAD courses at a community college this semester. Today I got a call from a large aerospace company asking if I was still interested in working for them. For many reasons, I have a strong feeling that if I pursue that opportunity it would lead to a job. I like teaching and think I’d like to do it full time eventually, but am unsure that I have enough industry experience to make me attractive enough to ever get hired as a full time post-secondary instructor at a community college or university. My (simplified) options are to:

1. Double down on my freelance CAD and 3D printing business, gain experience through that while continuing to work as an adjunct instructor, have variable pay, shoot for getting the first full time teaching position I can get, and eventually progress to a university (getting a Masters or Ph.D. if I have to). 
2. Take the aerospace job after finishing this semester’s courses, gain more industry experience, get paid a lot more, and try again at being a professor in a few more years.

I’d probably enjoy teaching more than working in industry, but I’m afraid that without gaining more industry experience I’ll never get the opportunity to progress past being a part time adjunct instructor. Also, in the long term working in aerospace would pay significantly more than teaching at a community college and probably more than at a university.

43,Question regarding differential gear systems,1535676035,"I am building (on paper for now) a dream vehicle which is to be a F/T 6x6 or AWD layout. (think stretched sedan delivery hot rod)

 I've noticed that for light duty trucks, the most common way getting two powered axles in the rear is to put a chain drive box between drive shaft and first differential. There is then a stub shaft which goes over the first axle tube to the second differential which is mounted offset to the first. See here: [http://www.startracksmedical.com/6x6xcursion/6x62ndaxle.html](http://www.startracksmedical.com/6x6xcursion/6x62ndaxle.html) There are a few problems with this approach. 1) The chain drive boxes can be noisy 2) Extra height between differential and body of the vehicle is required. 3) These chain drive boxes are intended for high torque, low speed applications (offroading) and can suffer from excessive wear during prolonged highway speeds.

It occurs to me that, by making a custom cast differential housing, you could have the main drive shaft driving the differential ring gear as normal and then a second spur gear at the rear with a stub shaft leading to and driving the second differential. 

Now, I know that the stub shaft would counter-rotate in relation to the main drive shaft. So for the second differential, I'd flip it over so its ring gear is on the driver side. (conventional differentials usually have the ring gear on the passenger side AFAIK) 

I'm sure you can see an obvious problem with my proposed solution: Namely that in a differential, the spur and ring gears form a worm gear drive. Which means that the first differential ring gear \*can't\* drive the second spur gear or am I missing something? 

A less obvious problem is that, near as I can tell, opposing wheels would be ""locked"" together using any kind of differential I know of. e.g. the passenger side middle wheel is fixed to the ring gear, the differential only allows a difference between the driver side and passenger side wheels on that axle. Picking up power from the ring gear at the back and passing it to an inverted differential for the third axle means that the driver side rear wheel is ""locked"" to the middle passenger side wheel. Leading of course to axle wind-up and tire scrub. Axle spacing will be close enough that I do not think a differential between second and third axles would be needed, but I might be wrong

Assuming that the differential housings will be fixed rigidly to the frame and hence will not move in relation to each other, what would be the best way to set this up so that all four rear wheels are powered and have differentials in relation to left and right side? 

my goals are:

1) the lowest overall profile to allow the lowest, flattest floor in the rear of the vehicle

2) be very quiet

3) be able to handle hot rod levels of torque and HP (I'm aiming at 1000 ft/lbs and 1000HP)

I think the easiest solution to the worm gear problem is custom made spur and ring gears that are a conical gear and crown gear. This would be a noisier gear profile, but still quieter than a chain drive box. That still leaves the issue of differential actions.

46,Worked several years as a software developer. What are good career exits out of software development and into engineering?,1535666850,"Let me preface with saying I am not an average software developer. My work history is pretty sub-par. I've worked in software tech for about nine years, only counting the years I have been employed because my work history often alternates between having a job and not being employed. I usually lose my job before I can get another one lined up. I am now almost 36, still struggling to be financially self-sufficient and with little to show for the career.

Because of that, I don't have leverage for any good jobs. I got stuck in a cycle of getting the first offer, which is not necessarily a great offer, just stuck with small, underpaying companies. Combine with the fact that I graduated with a non STEM degree (a bit late, at age 25) which makes it difficult for more companies to open doors for you, especially without a good network. 

 I do not have a good network that I can use for referrals or job recommendations. I could talk to my colleagues that I have on LinkedIn, but not get replies. People usually don't like it others stop talking to you for years only to come out of the blue to ask a favor. So I stopped doing that. I know I'm a shut-in, but taking word from someone who is depressed bipolar but making six figures, he's told me to not let your negative traits define you as a person.

I prefer to follow a career where a mediocre network does not necessarily become an obstacle to landing and maintaining a stable FTE job. Again, I don't want the negatives to make an impact on my life or who I am as a person. And engineering is something I would consider getting into. So what is a good exit out of a mediocre career, and into engineering? And entering with a cleaner slate?

I've been a controls and automation engineer for 6.5 years now. I've gotten dang good at troubleshooting and programming SCADA systems, plants and machines, and a bunch of other niche devices/solutions. But, the culture of my company doesn't really protect the home life of their engineers. I've expressed my desire for a consistent and strong home life balance, but even if they can keep me local, occasional trips pop up, which wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't usually on short notice with little wiggle room. I also am finding myself working at odd hours, which is also tough on my family. My toddler uses years, minutes, days, weeks, and hours interchangeably. explaining on a day's notice that Daddy won't be there for bedtime like he usually does goes pretty poor, and it's frequent these days. I don't see this trend getting better at my company, and I want a more stable situation. I'm willing to take a hit in pay for this.  


As for alternate ideas, PCB design is at the top. I went to school for Low-level PCB Design, and that's about 1% of what I do now. I'd like to get into that industry. Are there any PCB engineers out there who can tell me a bit about their day-to-day and can tell me about the home life/ work life balance. I know crunch time is inevitable and extra hours will be needed here and there in any engineering job (If you know none of this and your job is a neat 40 M-F every week, let me know!), but I'd like to know if PCB would be a good route to go?

Engineers of Reddit, lets hear what good bosses are like. Engineering is a great profession, for as many terrible bosses in the thread linked above there have to be good counterparts.

---------------------------

My current boss is the best I have ever had. He ""gets it.""

Very straightforward - if you screw up expect to hear about it moments after, not at your review months later. Will be rough, but a positive experience with how you could've handled it better and what it takes to fix this *right now.* Likes to course-correct quickly rather than let issues simmer. We have weekly sync meetings because he likes to hear what we think and uses our input in his planning. Does everything he can to make you look good at review time. Sets up meetings 9-6-3-months prior to reviews and makes sure you are hitting goals and on track for promotions. 

Understands we sometimes get slammed, and is very flexible when slow. When he asks us (or we get screwed into) working weekends or OT he gives us comp days. Work At Home isn't a dirty phrase. If you need to lock yourself out of the cube farm to deep dive something, go for it. Let him know when you come up for air.

Most of all, he trusts us.100% backs us. Meeting where he doesn't know the score and you say something? 100% in your corner. Will back you until proven otherwise.

If I go to him and say ""I have X problem and it will take Y steps to fix,"" he validates and then says ""OK, do it."" Mostly this is time/schedule related, but sometimes money related. Direct quote: ""Takes more money paying us to talk about it than to fix it. Get out of my office and *get it done.*""

Always has our back in meetings. Will absolutely yell in private if you F'd up, but only at you and never in public.

**Details:**  This is a 5 story parking garage in an apartment complex. Each level has 19 parking spaces on each side, plus room at each end for 2 cars to turn the corner and go up to the next floor. Each floor is on an incline and constructed of 17 big slabs of concrete. They are as side as 2 parking spaces and 2 car lanes.   


**Context:** I live down a long hall from this parking garage and can feel the concrete slabs slam together every time cars drive over it.  I don't know if my neighbors do and wonder if mine is simply at a place where all the vibrations collide or something. At the place where the slabs meet, the joints appear to be falling apart. They clearly have been repaired multiple times, even though this apt complex is only 6 years old.  Today I saw a new sound blast hole in the floor.

I'm trying to use SAP2000 to validate a relatively simple numerical FE model.

Certainly the software isn't broken so the issue must lie in my model, and knowing how the stiffness is calculated would allow me to work backwards to find my problem.

Hello,

I was just curious about some standard career paths that may take place in the controls field. Specifically, how people get into flight controls positions and what they do. I graduated with a BS in ME this year and have programmed PID loops in Python for a simple robot, programmed Siemens S7, and I have run aero simulations for my FSAE club during school. These seem like a good start towards flight controls but now I am working at a factory automation company and currently do not program, although I am supposed to start learning after a year or so. Is this good experience that will count toward a flight controls job or are they related at all? I believe ladder logic is not used in flight controls as much as C++ or Python. Id be interested in any experience or knowledge anyone has in these fields.

Apparently some kind of secure storage for high value items, or something.  It's all steel studs at the moment, no drywall yet (looks like they're ready any time...all electrical is in, etc.) 

The ceiling of this room (12' high) is the size of the room, and is made from the same steel studs as the walls.  The steel studs are 362PDS125-19...3-5/8 inches, 65 ksi steel.  The ones on the ceiling have this number on them, which I then tried to look up on the internet, and the maximum clear span (at 4psf dead load) is 9'5"", if I'm reading the data [here](https://www.itools.clarkdietrich.com/submittalpro/dyn_pdf/%7B%22pdf_type%22%3A%22individual_product%22%2C%22project_product_code%22%3A%22product%7Cprostud~product_code%7C362PDS125-19-65ksi~coating%7CG40EQ%22%7D/CD_362PDS125-19-65ksi.pdf) (PDF) right.  I know that this is the model of the studs they're using, I walked over and peered at one of them and this was the number on the side.

94,I have realized that there is no perfect job; which career better option for me between engineering and medicine?,1535581155,"Hello everyone, I (19M) am a electrical engineering/cpE major and rising sophomore. Quick note, I know this is more of AskDocs question; I'll post this in there as well. Throughout my first year of college I spent most of my time completing prerequisite classes like calc, physics, and engineering design. After my first year my opinion overall opinion on ECE (although we hadn't started actual EE classes) was that it was okay...but I felt that my passion probably lies more in medicine. I don't know if I'd be a good engineer; I think that there are so many others who are simply more gifted than I am in this field. However, I think I would be a good doc; medicine is just a field where my comfort lies more in and one that I would enjoy working in. I love medical research, the work doctors do, and the noble cause that their job encompasses.

However, making a quick and uninformed decision might be disastrous. Right now I probably have grass is greener syndrome without knowing what I'm getting myself into. The thing that worries me about pursuing medicine is the inevitable toll that all the training supposedly takes on one's life. 10-15 years seems absolutely brutal, almost like jail. I imagine I'll miss out on time for family, relationships, life experiences, and I'll most likely be broke from all that debt. I can't speak for everyone, but I don't know if I'm willing to give up a huge chunk of my youth to pursue a career that might be slightly more passionate towards. I think the sacrifices would be much greater than what I am even imagining right now and over time I'm imagining the luster will fade away as there are problems with every job. Should I pack all my bags and dive in? Or will I be making a cataclysmic blunder?

I have a feeling that it might be wise to stay in ECE although I'm not fully enjoying myself doing it (I'd honestly rather do CS), but I really don't know right now because I have an undying urge to seek out my passion. I have about one more week before school starts; I've been pondering this for the entire summer and at this point I'm exhausted and if someone forced me to do either one I would be happy. Right now, it pains me to choose one option because it's probably what I'll be doing for half of my waking days. Every day I feel as if I've made up my mind but the next day I end up switching again. My goal is to make a choice by the end of this week and never look back. Can someone tell me about their personal experience with a career in engineering and from the information given come up with the right decision for me?

I cook up a lot of crazy ideas, usually just as thought experiments. This is one where I can't fully imagine how to approach, as I'm not sure what sort of device to use. (And so my google-fu fails me)

My Mini Cooper has headlights that turn with the steering wheel (almost like an electronic Tucker!), and I figured it might be interesting to endow my Jeep's off-road lights with the same ability for the occasional night wheeling.

Ideally, I would just have a curved light with vertical arrays of LEDs that are individually activated or deactivated by the angle of the pitman arm, so no moving parts are required.

However, I have a set of 4"" post mounted spot lights already and I'm somewhat partial to mechanical solutions on this vehicle. For authenticity or something...though, I would not balk at an electronically driven solution like a small stepper motor driven by a sensor on the pitman arm.

My basic understanding is that the parts should be:

1) cleaned (recommendations?)
2) puttied to fill in holes / gaps (what is best practice?)
3) painted (again, what is best practice?)

We had one supplier who outputted very good quality but said the puttying was far too time consuming. Current supplier outputs inconsistent quality and doesn't want to do any more unless we can provide better surface quality casted parts.

20,Question about drawing interpretation,1535510615,"At work we ran into a problem with a discrepancy between how a physical part looks versus how it looks on the print. The part conforms to every dimension and tolerance on the print, but there is a feature shown on the print pictorially that is not present on the physical part. This feature is not constrained with dimensions and tolerances in any way on the part. The drawing says to interpret per ASME Y14.5 2015. I don't have access to this standard, but from memory, I am under the impression that there is a clause in the standard to cover this situation. Does anyone have any guidance for how to interpret the feature in this situation? Is the part conforming since every dimension and tolerance on the print is met? Or is the part nonconforming because it deviates from the pictorial representation on the print?

21,Career Advice: What to do if you feel if you're stagnating,1535506567," I'm an electrical engineer with a Bachelor's and Master's degree, and I'm still working the same job that I got immediately out of college. It's been a little over two years now, not yet three, so I just wanted to ask about when you decided to switch jobs to further your career. I'm just unsure as to whether I should look for another job, so I just thought to get some professional opinions here.

​

I guess I'm not really sure why I chose electrical engineering. I'd say I probably had a desire to build stuff, so I chose electrical engineering, though I guess I spent my senior year doing more programming rather than actual hardware work like with op-amps and feedback circuits. After I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's, I really wasn't sure what to do, so I figured I'd go for my Master's degree at the same university, finishing it in 2016. Then, when I went job searching, I found that my university had an opening, so I applied and got the job there, which is where I am today.

​

The job is nice, and there are a lot of great benefits. Also, considering that I still live with my parents, I don't have much to worry about in terms of a mortgage or rent. I guess the downside is that I can't help but think I'm stagnating with regards to my career. People always talk about either changing the world or making lots of money with an engineering skill set. For me, I probably thought that way at some point, but I'm not so sure if I feel that way anymore. My current employer was the first one that actually replied back to my resume, so I just took what I could because I couldn't stay unemployed. It would be nice to switch jobs and probably build my career learning new things and such, but right now, I can't help but think that in the end, it doesn't even matter and that nothing I do will have real significance, and I'm a little afraid of forgoing the life I have now. Honestly, the only real reason I'd consider looking for another job is mainly for financial reasons, but getting a job out of state would incur more significant costs compared to my current situation today even if the pay is a lot more. Is this line of thought normal for people just starting out like me in the world of engineering, or maybe I just feel this way cause I don't really do much to make life meaningful?",AskEngineers,False,Jsyschan,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9b4x28/career_advice_what_to_do_if_you_feel_if_youre/

25,Mass Spring Input Output Struggles,1535498698,"I'm really struggling trying to understand what the solution to a problem I am working on is. I have seen a ton of similar stuff on the internet but nothing that really helps me figure out the solution. 

**The Problem:** A ""single dimension"" Mass-Spring system with a step input. (eventually will be a ramp input but I want to start simple)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is almost exactly like the second slide on this slide share, except with out a damper. ([https://www.slideshare.net/SondiponAdhikari/base-excitation-of-dynamic-systems](https://www.slideshare.net/SondiponAdhikari/base-excitation-of-dynamic-systems))

&amp;#x200B;

I first set up my free body diagram, the input dimension is Y and and output is X \[to be consistent with the slide\].

&amp;#x200B;

**The sum of the forces  = mass\*x\_acceleration = K\_factor \* (Y - X) - mass\*gravity**

&amp;#x200B;

Divide both sides by mass and get the respect variables to either side.

&amp;#x200B;

**X\_accel + X \* (K/mass) = Y  \* (K/mass) - gravity**  // or // d\^2x/dt\^2 + x(t) \* (K/mass) = Y \* (K/mass) - gravity

&amp;#x200B;

And after this i'm at a loss on how to solve it. 

I tried Laplace Transform stuff and I just get an insane transfer functions. 

* (K/mass) - gravity is a constant so it becomes (K/mass) - gravity / s
* The left side becomes s\^2 + (K/mass)
* And the transfer function X(s) / Y(s) becomes **(K/mass) - gravity) / (s\^3 + s \* (K/mass))**

I can't figure out how to factor s\^3 + s \* K/mass to get it to a solvable Laplace transform.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have no idea how to solve the equation without this methods.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really frustrated I feel like this is a simple problem, but I've been stuck on it for three days. Everything i've found on the internet either ignore gravity for some reason, or is a mass-spring-damper system which brings in the extra s\^2 variable that makes it factorable to where you can use partial fraction decomposition to get it into values that you can use the inverse Laplace tables with.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I just missing something simple here? I took one Dynamic System courses last year, but it wasn't taught that well.

Is the car designed to hold up under such conditions or not?  If not, what are the limitations to doing this and is it something that can be overcome at a non-ridiculous cost?

35,I Am A Highschool Student Looking For Guidance,1535473880,"In case you don't have time to read the entire post, I have **emboldened** my questions.  
&amp;nbsp;  

***
&amp;nbsp;  
I'll begin by providing some background information. I am a Canadian high school student about to begin my senior year. The (relevant) classes that I am enrolled in are *Math 30-1 AP*, *Math 31 AP*, *Physics 30-1*, and *Chemistry 30-1*. I have been passing all of my classes with pretty good grades, and I plan on taking this final year even more seriously.  
&amp;nbsp;  

This year is going to be so important to me because I plan on going to university after I graduate. For the past couple of years of my life, I have been toying with the idea of becoming an engineer. I enjoy math and science, especially when I can use it in real life scenarios. I also enjoy computer programming. For the last 5 years, I have been programming on and off. I consider myself pretty familiar with basic languages like Python and Java/C#, and I want to learn C++ sometime in the future. I also enjoy designing things, which is why I like wood working.  
&amp;nbsp;  

As I have been getting closer and closer to graduating, I have looked further into the different fields of engineering. Initially, I thought that Software Engineering would be a great fit because of my love for computers and programming, but I think based on my past patterns, I would burn out after a while. **Are there any Software Engineers that can help provide some insight as to what you might do in a normal day, and some of the long-term challenges you experienced (such as burnout/losing interest, or not being able to find employment)?**  
&amp;nbsp;  

I have been reading that Mechanical Engineering is a very versatile field. I will say that it has peaked my interest, because I like designing things that I can use, and I have also seen it mentioned that programming can be useful in this field. **Can any Mechanical Engineers confirm or deny whether programming is used and useful in this field? Also, what kind of person do think would enjoy Mechanical Engineering? What are some interests/hobbies that are helpful? What would a normal day look like for you at your current job?**  
&amp;nbsp;  

I have also seen a lot of mentions of Chemical and Civil engineering. I don't think I have an interest for either of these fields, **but if there is anyone who shared a similar opinion and ended up in either of these fields, I would love to hear from you.** 
&amp;nbsp;  

I also understand that job availability is extremely important. This is something that I can probably research by myself, however **I would like to hear firsthand if there are some specific fields that are in high demand or over saturated. What do you predict to be a growing field, and what do you predict to be a dying field?**  
&amp;nbsp;  

For now, these are most of the specific questions I have. A couple general questions I have are as follows:  

* **Is there any field that is mostly regarded as the most fun/interesting? I assume it is based on the person, but is there a general consensus on one?**  
* **If you could change what field you studied, what would you change it to?**  
* **What is the mistake do you see a lot of students my age make when choosing a field?**  
* **Do you regret going into engineering? If so, what do you wish you did?**  
* **Were your expectations of what you would do in your field met? If not, what ended up being the reality?**  

&amp;nbsp;  

Thank you all so much for reading, and I am especially grateful for anyone who answers my questions.

My main goal/plan is to get an engineering degree while in and then commission in the guard. This will help with leadership and job experience in/around my field. I plan to live near Texas/Arkansas area. 

If I obtain a industrial engineering degree while I’m in how much more classes would I have to take to get a civil or electrical/mechanical degree. Will most the classes transfer and only have to do certain classes in that field?

I want to do the industrial degree because it is offered in person classes right Off the base and on weekends so it makes it easier for me instead of doing a lot of classes online. 

How fast is the job hunt after you obtain your degree? Do most of you find work directly after getting out of school? I would be happy with a salary of 45000 because that’s about what I make now and would still have health/life insurance though the military as well as some form of retirement.

56,Do I wait it out and hope things get better or jump ship?,1535418704,"So about a year ago I got a new job in the field I wanted (automotive, racing) after searching for two years. I went from a large engineering firm that I started with out of college (I hated the work, MEP consulting) with about 100 employees to a small family owned company with about 25. 

At first everything seemed like to was going to be great. The company make some really cool stuff for alot of different high end cars. I'd be working/training under the only other engineer there so I'd get alot of one on one. I couldn't wait to dive right and and get to learning about gearbox design. 

I was told I'd start out in inspection just to get a feel for what we made and how tight the tolerances were. I figured this would help me in my design work and I'm all for a little bit of hands on work anyway. Next I was told I was going to learn how some of our assemblies go, so that I could improve the build instructions. Again, makes sense.

Here we are a year later and I'm still just inspecting parts and have become the sole assembler of the product I was trained on. Ive probably sat at my desk 10 times in the past year. Ive had conversations with my boss several times now about how I feel I got screwed and he keep promising I'll get to do what I was actually hired to do soon. 

I've thought about quittig and finding something but:
1) I feel like I'll be starting from square one yet again because I haven't gotten any design experience in this job. This will make it hard yet again to find what I want. I have no desire to be a quality engineer. 
2) The company itself is severely understaffed as it is and doesn't seem to be doing well financially. I feel like if I leave it will totally screw them and I'd feel bad. 

So do I just suck it up and hope we make it out/fill more positions,  or start looking elsewhere and hope I find something? I really want this job to work out but it's extremely frustrating some days. 

TL;DR I got hired for a cool position that I'd searched awhile for. After a year I am doing other duties entirely and see no end in sight.

58,Seeking professional advice on how to deal with sinking basement/foundation,1535415915,"I’m wondering if any engineers might be willing to weigh in on some basement issues that my local engineers can’t seem to agree on. We live in a 100 year old home in Canada and our basement is one of them rubble/stone basements without any footing to speak of. It’s been super dry and it looks like the ground is sinking underneath one wall which has now cracked apart from the other walls in the corners and sunk a good 1.5 inches. It’s no longer touching the house on that side either.

So first I had an independent engineer come out and tell me that this is what these basements do, that underpinning stone doesn’t work so really the only thing to do is to repoint/patch everything up and we may have just do it again if things keep shifting. But then two of the contractors we got in said that that can successfully underpin a stone foundation and they have engineers who will sign off on it And then a third contractor agreed with my engineer that underpinning the stone wouldn’t work. He agreed that up until about 5 years ago they were just recommending standard repointing as well. But now they recommend removing the old mortar using polyurea as a stronger replacement. Apparently it’s got way more give while staying bonded. The assumption being the ground is still going to shift up and down underneath but this product will withstand larger shifts without breaking apart. 

At this point I don’t know who to believe and what the best option would be. I'm particularly interested in this polyurea solution as it it half the cost of of underpinning.  Has anyone ever heard of using this type of product to provide strength to withstand soil shifting?

63,Finding empirical drag coefficient value for comparison,1535405276,"Hi, 

My project consists of finding the optimal Grid Fin configuration for a flyback booster. I have attached a link explaining my project in more details. https://imgur.com/a/QAVFw9P 

One concern I have is how I would I know my drag values aren't completely wrong? I can't actually go to a windtunnel and experiment with fins since it would be really expensive. 

One idea I had was to do this:
-Using the CFD software, find the drag force on the fins
-Using the drag equation, solve for the Cd
-Compare the calculated Cd value to empirical drag Cd values..As long as my Cd values are within range of the empirical data, I should be good. 

 One problem with that is that the Cd values above are from subsonic speeds while I'm aiming to go transonic/supersonic. 


Another option is this:
Break down the grid fin into simpler geometry where empirical aerodynamic data does exist, and extrapolate that into a grid fin. Example, flow through a short square duct. You then just put them all together and evaluate the flow patterns with that. You then cite some assumptions and estimates for losses due to other short square ducts being in the same vicinity, and you may not have a hardcore accurate number, but you have an educated bit of data to go on. 

I'd like some feedback on both processes and would like to know if there are other ways to compare my Cd values to real data values to make sure my CFD setup isn't wrong.

69,Help With Networking and Jobs Beyond Academia,1535398443,"
**tl;dr - I don't really know how to network well and am not sure what my career trajectory does or should look like. Basically 'what am I doing with my life'**


Background: I'm a 24 year old grad student finishing up my first year in a Ph.D. program in Material Science and Engineering. I work on wide bandgap semiconductors for various applications. I really love the work, and have only recently transferred into an engineering field after I graduated from undergrad (I used to be more in the natural sciences, physics and chemistry). This was a challenge with much less of a solid engineering background  than any of my peers who all had been in some sort of engineering discipline as undergrads. The first year I had been doubling down on classes, and mostly just tried to not die while learning as much as I could. I'm still here so it seems to have gone okay. My advisor is reasonably well known for the field and a very hands-off person with the group, but the group has plenty of older students that act as mentors for the younger ones. So I don't get a ton of direct guidance.


Now that the first year is mostly over and I have my feet wet with actual labwork and research, I've started thinking about my future career trajectory both while I'm here in grad school and beyond it. What I'm realizing is **I don't even know what jobs are typical in my field; I have no idea what job titles would be or what they'd entail.** I firmly do not want to stay in academia even a minute more than I have to, but most of the exposure to job prospects feels like it focuses around academia since we're at a university. I've heard of staff scientists which seems like a neat position, and Project Managers but that title seems to be a dirty word to a lot of people (not sure why). Basically I'm shooting blind in the dark at a black cat. I don't know what I'm preparing most for and don't know what my goals should be.

The other thing people always tell me is to network with the people around me. Especially the staff scientists and development engineers. While I like all of them, I don't usually have a reason to meet with them individually or to discuss, since our projects don't always align. **I feel weird and awkward just approaching them to shoot the shit, and I feel disingenuous seeking advice for every little small thing to have an excuse to talk with them.** On top of that, once whatever question I have is answered, what else is there to really say? I feel awkward as hell extending it for no real reason. it's still a bit too early for me to go to conferences to present data and subsequently shmooze with profs, but even if it wasn't I'm not sure I'd really know what I was doing.

Am I overthinking this? Am I going about it the wrong way? Is it too early to be this worried about this stuff? What proactive steps can I take to improve myself and my position? I'll be answering this thread as actively as I can, so if you want clarifying or more info just ask.

73,Career direction for an ME. Sick of dealing with customer issues,1535386690,"Product engineer with an bsme from a top 10 public engineering school in the US. Graduated 4 years ago.

My main question is I don't know what to do with my career. I'd like to utilize my degree if possible. I'll outline. My experience and likes/dislikes below so maybe someone can better assess what I might be interested in. 

&amp;nbsp;

First job out if school was at a tier 1 auto supplier as a design engineer. Surfacing with NX for non-class A surfaces. Got sick of spending 100% of my time in CAD and product review meetings. Also I was in a contract and promised full hire after 8 months. Had shit pay even for a fresh grad. Upon giving them my notice to leave they said they had plans for me to become a program manager some day and also offered me a product engineer postion. They couldn't even match my pay from my new job offer, which was still barely average for the area. After 1 year I moved to my current job as a product engineer. 

&amp;nbsp;

Lots of issues with this job. We design AG equipment, outsource mfg, store product in our warehouse. Multi billion dollar company with global presence, although my branch in the US only deals with the US market. Company stated in US, and was bought out by a foreign interested family. 

90% of my time is band aiding issues with equipment in the field due to incorrect installation by the customer. Or due to lack of quality control from our manufacturers and us. Salesman promise it will be fixed asap. Root cause analysis is impossible bc we have no way of obtaining accurate, reliable information about the whole system. Usually it's a combination of things and determining the root cause is nearly impossible.

We have no quality control. No first in first out, no revision control in the warehouse. We don't check parts coming in and the only time they're checked is by me when there is an issue. Using a folder on a shared windows drive called ""drawings"" and we have no PDM. Our parent company has PDM that the and the rest of the world's branches use but we do not bc everyone here is stubborn and old, been here since before this foreign family bought the company. 

1/4 of the drawings are scanned hand drawings from 40 years ago that haven't been updated into cad.

We get demands from sales VP to revolutionize our products to gain marketshare, but then in the next breath wants us to just copy the competition. The constantly contradict themselves and make us run in a circle. 

So while I'm trying to design these dreams for the sales team, I get pulled off them constantly for customer support issues. I have a ""hot"" product that I've been trying to complete for 2 years. I finally have it done, just need to finalize/tweak drawings. It's been 3 weeks since I've touched it. Just been dealing with customer service problems since. 

We have 1 other engineer in our division (2 others here as well). He typically works on 1 product exclusively while I handle everything else. He's been here 2 years longer and recently got promoted to lead. 

My boss is nice in that she doesn't ride us, but she's not an engineer, knows very little about engineering in any way, has no leadership qualities, nearly literally pulls her hair out during meetings, face in hands. Constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The only time I hear from her is when she's all flustered and needs a fix for something right now. No time for testing, FEA simulations or anything, just get it out the door. 

The only thing I like is that it's casual in that I don't have to record time on projects (all though it might help management see waste that is out of my control), and the fact that I work strict **40 hour weeks** I love this bc I don't like being at work and my wife and I like to camp and hike a lot on spare time. This is pretty much the only thing I like here. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Hobbies:**

I like messing with home network stuff like setting up my own hosted cloud server and everything that goes along with that (learning Linux, network security practices, how to even install the software etc). Because of this I think maybe I'd like something related to computer science? Maybe that's naive. I did enjoy Matlab projects in school which was similar in a minute way. I also am attracted to CS bc it seems like we would have more options for where we could move to. Mech engineering seems like you're stuck in bigger cities typically. 

I look forward to getting a home so I can work on home improvements and carpentry. 

I also enjoy to an extent, working on our vehicles (ball joint replacements, wheel bearings, brake jobs etc) but I think it's more bc of the sense of accomplishment I feel from saving $300+ and being self reliant. 

My wife and I like mountain biking, kayaking, camping/backpacking/hiking, cross country skiing, and just site seeing in general. 

I'm not super social, but I'm not a hermit either. I can carry a conversation  and think of stuff to talk about. I feel like I'm better at this than most engineers, but that doesn't mean I enjoy talking to people a lot per say. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is a long ass post but I wanted to convey my dislikes and preferences to allow you to give me potentially more helpful suggestions.

Now my assumption and correct me if Iam wrong is that water in soil faces much higher resistance so it doesnt rise so high. In open well however water rises higher  so its not a representitave value for overall groundwater level in soil?

Structure is about 15m apart from well and soil in general is compacted sand 0-5m and then clay below 5m. Well is circual with diameter about 1,2m.

What would be the most practical materials/methods  for a 150-ish meter high structure / tower? It would be in the middle of a city. It would need to support itself for ~50 years. 
* Public safety is paramount.  
* Shape is not so important. 
* The structure doesn't need to be load bearing. 
* Doesn't need to meet specifications for dwellings or offices or lifts or anything other. 
* It just needs to exist like a mini-Eiffel tower.

Let's say the Earth's surface is a radiated hellscape. You've been tasked with creating an underground 'ark' that can sustain a human population for hundreds of years.

Let's also say **money**, **manpower**, **time** or **political capital** is no object. What could we do with current, or near-future technology, if we were building an installation to house, say, 500 people with a birth/death ratio of 1:1. 

\-- **Air.** Would such a complex be able to have its own internal oxygen-generation system? Electrolysis from water? A biosphere? Even with an excellent air filtration system in place from the topside, you would probably want a backup in case it ever breaks down, no? 

\-- **Food** would probably have to be grown for that amount of time, so would it make sense for such an installation to have not just greenhouses for veggies, but also livestock somehow? Could we have farms under ground? Or would fish make more sense, maybe an aquaponic solution?

\-- **Power.** What would be the most efficient source here for this amount of time? Solar cells from the surface? Or a small nuclear reactor under ground? What about fuel cells?  Geo-thermal power? And how much power would we need?

\-- **Water.** As I understand it, we are able to purify irradiated water so are there any significant challenges here? How would we access the natural water deposits? Are some sources better than others?

\-- **Sewage**. Any special considerations here? And would bacteria/infection be a unique challenge in such a closed system?

\-- **Seed Archive.** It might make sense to have a large collection of seeds for commonly planted crops for when the survivors re-emerge. From reading about the Seedbank on Svalbard, they would need to be stored in freezing temperatures and a low-oxygen environment to delay decay, I think?

**MAINTENANCE**: What kind of actions would be needed on a day-to-day basis to maintain such a large system, and keep it from failing?

Now, I've been on the job hunt for the last 5 months and haven't really netted many results, other than some offers for positions in completely different fields, or in super remote areas. I am fairly certain I am going to be offered a position as a field engineer for a small communications company. My understanding of the position is that I would be doing diagnosis and testing to ensure quality for fiber optic data lines before handing them over to customers.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, my ideal field is in a completely different area; ideally I'd like to go into controls engineering or something in embedded systems. However, all of the controls engineer positions and embedded-based positions that I've been seeing require experience.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Should I accept this position if offered? What steps can I, or should I take to work towards my goal?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I have been using stuff like steppers, servos, and microcontrollers for years now, all for amateur applications. From small projects to big projects that are still in use today. In the few interviews I've had, I definitely bring those up and talk about them. I find myself competent when talking about those sort of things. So I'm confident if I can get my foot in the door and get a position for controls, I would do very well in it. I know that most are controlled by PLCs, which I have started doing research on.

In short: the motor takes longer than usual, about 5 seconds, to come to speed, doesn’t quite reach full speed with the blade on (based on me listening to it), and has very little power when making a cut.

A few weeks ago I did a deck project for a neighbor down the road and hauled my table saw back and forth on my trailer. When using my saw at the neighbor’s on an extension cord I noticed the above problems. I finished the project and let the saw sit, thinking it wasn’t getting enough current through the extension cord. The problem persists when plugged in directly, however.

The driveline and rotor spin freely, so I don’t believe it’s a friction issue. I checked the start and run capacitors with my multimeter’s resistance function, and concluded the capacitors are not the problem. I then tested the motor with each capacitor disconnected individually. The motor did not start with the start capacitor disconnected, but there was no change in behavior with the run capacitor disconnected. So, perhaps something wrong with the wiring of the run capacitor?

I continued to disassemble the motor and did not notice any worn or otherwise disfunctioning wires, but I did notice some suspect laminations in the stator.

40,[Help] Electrical safety gear for machines?,1535157168,"Hi,

I'm a noob when it comes to electrical safety gear for machines.

I want to use a Schmersal door handle switch in my safety circuit because i like the function of it and the price point.


If i look in the datasheet it states a *Required short-circuit current* and a very small *switching capacity*. I've never seen a required short-circuit current before, what is this for?

Due to the 10mA switching current rating, is this designed to only work with special safety relays? 

From my noob understanding, electrical safety gear tends to go to a safety relay module, where the signal from the safety devices are used to engage a relay coil. Relay coils tend to draw a lot more current than 10mA. So i don't quite understand.

The power supply I chose for it does 24 volts, and it's fine since the driver is constant current (china TB6600)

Unfortunately, the drivers I have max out at about 2.5A. I'm wasting a huge amount of potential holding power and speed by using the motors with these drivers.

Looking it up, 5A stepper drivers that actually run at 5A are ridiculously expensive.

I know stepper windings are a bunch of series and parallel coils. Assuming I am able to isolate the correct coils, would there be anything wrong with finding the parallel points in the motor (for each phase) and rewiring them to be in series? I know I'd have to ensure polarity stays the same.

If I'm lucky, the magnet wires might all run to a single pcb where I can just desolder and resolder them into another configuration.

My goal is to just run it at the driver's rated 2.5A. So doubling impedance in the motor, halving current by using a driver at 2.5A, and presumably the driver will be doubling voltage to the motor.

59,How To Create A Basic Inventory Management System?,1535104044,"A big part of my job involves paperwork.

This portion is mostly involved with ordering bulk loads of product from a 3rd party, which then goes to a 3rd party loader to load up, and then head to location.

My job is to make sure all the times match for delivery. I need the time the load was scheduled to arrive, the time the load spent at the loading facility, and the time the load arrived on location and the time it left location. There is a load number and bill of lading number attached to each individual load. The point of collecting these times is to access how much I, the customer, have to pay (if I have to pay) the 3rd party company for waiting time (usually if the truck is waiting to offload on location more than 2 hours). The point of rectifying these times is to make sure the 3rd party isn't lying. They may say they arrived 10 hours ago, but my records say they've only been here for 30 minutes, etc.

What I currently do is manually enter in all these trucks coming into location. It's a major pita and keeps me away from my engineering tasks. Not to mention, there is a high chance of paperwork inaccuracy due to this. The people who actually timestamp this data for me at location are high school graduates at best who are relegated to the logistics portion of the process because they lack the initiative and ability to do any other operation on location. Times are often wrong, times are often not written (yes, it's all hand written), and sometimes tickets are lost. It's still my @$$ when these operations issues affect my job.

Previously, I thought I could just purchase some sort of QR code device, mandate the materials loader to have QR codes on their loads, that way, the product would have a digital timestamp from point of dispatch to loader to location.This QR data would be stored on my company servers so it would be ""untampered"" data. However, more often than not, the locations these trucks operate in have very spotty cellular service.

How do I get around this? RFID?QR? I dunno, the main issue is 1: spotty cellular service at best, 2: getting a 3rd party to adopt a way of doing things for one of their many customers (though admittedly, probably one of their biggest customers).

I am aware Google docs supports QR codes as a way of doing inventory management, this would be a good starting point for me before I can actually prove to upper management to get IT to produce an in house inventory management service. Our needs aren't huge at all either. A typical job only involves about 400 bulk loads, even a home server from 1991 can handle such data.

I'm not too familiar with the field of ""Automatic identification and data capture"" as you can probably already tell.

Course Description: Orbital mechanics and space missions; chemical, nuclear, and electric rockets; nuclear heat sources; thermoelectric and photovoltaic devices.

Lasers also seems interesting, and the professor has relayed to us that it is a good resume builder for a number of applications.Course Description: Review of electromagnetic waves; applications of lasers and optics in engineering, e.g., position sensing, flowfield measurement, cutting and welding.


I can only imagine that Control is also a resume builder since it deals with controlling everything we might need to. Course description: Feedback and forward loop control design and simulation; discrete time and frequency domain methods with implementation considerations.

I am starting my PhD in MechE soon and my anxiety is getting the better of me. I know I can (and I did) google most of the following questions but I'd love to get some first-hand insight from your personal experience.

1. Does a PhD in Mech/Aero open any significant doors for engineers in the industry? How commonly do you encounter PhDs in the industry (particularly in the UK/Europe) and in what kind of positions? Are they really valued (see \*paid\*) more than engineers with just a master's?
2. How difficult is it to find an industrial R&amp;D job? I am guessing that making industrial connections during your PhD would be useful in finding ""secret"" positions? It looks like there are hardly any advertised R&amp;D positions (or any jobs specifically requiring a mech/aero PhD, really) even in big companies.
3. Do you feel like the specific topic of your thesis has limited the range of jobs that would otherwise be available to you? Is it common for someone to work in a completely different engineering field after their PhD?
4. Do you regret having done a PhD? Do you think that doing a PhD is worth the effort for someone that 100% wants to work in the industry?",AskEngineers,False,new-year-same-me,/r/AskEngineers/comments/99rx1o/mechanicalaerospace_phds_in_the_industry/

75,How to measure (and improve?) refrigeration performance?,1535052252,"I'm an EE starting a small scale/budget renewable energy project. One thing everyone needs is refrigeration - heating is easy, but ice is civilization. I already have experience on the electrical/solar generating side but now I'm looking at the load side.  My goal is to document something that's affordable, portable and predictable including any mods that a beginning maker could implement.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I picked up a used 1.7 cu.ft fridge for about $20 and started measuring its performance
2. Tested the electrical characteristics to confirm what I need to supply.  The power factor isn't great, so that's something on the electrical side to look at but not sure whether it will have any impact on refrigeration performance - that's just one reason why I want to measure and document the impact of any changes I make
3. I started with 1 kg of water, connected a temperature probe and plugged the fridge into a watt meter
4. I think I figured out COP but need to confirm. From [http://physics.weber.edu/thermal/refrigerators.pdf](http://physics.weber.edu/thermal/refrigerators.pdf) I get  
COP = Qc/W  
Qc = mC Tc  
W = electrical energy  

5. I ignored the volume of air in the fridge for Qc and just used the 1 kg of water. I get a COP of about 4.8 at Tc=10 C, going down to 2.5 around 4 C.  These are first estimates as I discovered some calibration issues with the thermocouple. 

Is this on the right track? Not 100% sure of the details.   I know  I need to control for more variables here and make recording easier - I have an arduino with multiple temperature probes, and will connect a power meter soon. Right now I'm measuring manually.   It seems to me that I need some time and temperature bounds to measure COP, otherwise W will keep increasing while Q stays constant (?)

&amp;#x200B;

The COP seems a bit limited as a metric as well - should I measure something else?  

What would be really useful is measuring ice at 0 C production in kg/kWh/day 

Also looking for ways to improve performance for people with limited resources. 

* I've noticed small refrigeration systems have nearly identical electrical consumption. So if your space resource is not a factor, anywhere from 4 to 10 cu ft. would likely be better
* Small fridges are easy on the budget and small, pure sine wave inverters are awfully cheap, while DC compressors are far from cheap - I would have to evaluate performance to see if they're up front cost is justified.
* I notice the compressor gets hot - but Ive read that this lets it work better - to a point - there's thermal protection as well.  Is the compressor temperature Th?  That would improve COP.    
COP  &lt;= 1 / (Th/Tc - 1)  

* I can look up the compressor specs, but not sure if the compressor temperature is spec'd or how I'd find it - if there's an optimal upper compressor temperature, it might make sense to add a temperature controlled fan.
* Could performance be improved using brine instead of ice? Was thinking this could make it easier for storage - moving brine to an external cooler.

Pros: stable
Cons: bowing of wheels since connection point is away from wheel, harder to manually turn wheels. Only pair of wheels we have access to are quite small.

I am trying to help a colleague, former engineer and now technical sales rep, become a better communicator with those on the business side of things. I'm in business development.

&amp;#x200B;

My colleague's communications are very technical and thorough, but do not convey their true needs. As such, there is almost always quite a bit of lost in translation happening. One example was a very thought out and verbose email that was taken by the team as a request to create a new accessory for an existing product. After quite a bit of back and fourth, a quick phone conversation uncovered that the desired outcome of the email wasn't to purchase or create a new accessory, but to see if an existing accessory in the market would meet code for a customer with a unique issue.

Now, before you ask, no, I won't name the university for obvious reasons. I have taken classes that I technically needed prereq's for (4th year engineering design class) because of a screw up in the system that allowed me. Now if you're thinking I should transfer out of leave, you'd be right and that's what I want to do. However I don't qualify for any assistance or unsub loans and the better schools around my area are either stupid expensive or would require me to retake alot of GE""s. So I figured I'd stick to that school and try to teach myself as much as possible afterschool. Now I know it sounds like a horrible school, but there are a few professors who do their job and are good, those of which answer my questions and help me. I feel like the courses and material is not extensive enough however. Today, my dad asked me if I knew how to design or even read the blueprints to a house.

16,Career advice needed: Trying to pursue career in Energy Storage (batteries) r&amp;d,1534969538,"I'm currently starting my 3rd year in PhD, studying lithium ion batteries. Earlier in my career, right after college, I worked as an operations engineer for a chemical plant. that was kind of rough. I was not intellectually engaged, and the type of people I was working with were very conservative in their mindset. Granted, most entry level engineers are not doing exciting work, but I saw little to no room for growth in that company (or industry for that matter), that would fully utilize my skillset. I would like to be engaged in my career, solving challenging engineering problems, and not so much people problems.. 

during that time, I became interested in renewable energy and energy storage, and recognized that this is probably a top 3 challenge facing humanity. I figured if we're going to get up in the morning for our 8-5, there should be a greater purpose. I decided I wanted to do research, because I've always had this inclination (3 years undergrad research), so I decided to come back for my PhD, studying lithium ion batteries. Since then, I've learned how saturated the field is, and how much junk there is in academic research. Most people in academia (based on papers I've read) don't seem to have a concept (or care) of the standards that commercial cells have, much less making improvements to them (only a few do that). They just want to publish to keep the funding alive. Moreover, materials research, which is like 90% of the papers on batteries, cover only maybe less than 30% of the impact on commercial batteries (don't quote me ;-)). there is economy of scale, battery safety, cell design, module design, integration, etc etc. that's where most of the jobs are, and these do not require PhD's, as far as I know..

At this point, I'm asking myself, should I just master out and try to find a position as an engineer, or stick it out, and hope that the job I land at the end of the PhD is related to my field? If I master out, I would have plenty of experience on batteries. I would have 1 (1st author) publication (possibly 2, though unlikely). I don't have a great resume, so maybe I can work at a smaller company for a couple of years, and then apply for one of the bigger manufacturers (apple, google, tesla, etc). If I stay for the PhD, I'm not sure I'd have a spot in battery research, considering most of these researchers have post docs. I'd be fighting for a much smaller piece of the pie, against very smart and accomplished people.

things I really care about my career are: intellectually engaging, good work/life balance, forward thinking work environment. Money is secondary to me, compared to the other factors I've listed. I'm trying to figure out where I could fit in, and I hope people on here can help me figure this out.

19,Choosing a plain bearing with low friction coefficient for low speed application,1534962392,"I am looking to reduce the backlash on my tabletop lathe cross slide.

Most of the play comes from the way the lead screw is tightened in the cross slide ""head"" - if the indexed measurement ring is tightened for no play, operating the lead screw requires a lot of force, so I currently need to allow for some play in order to be able to operate the screw easily.

I plan on machining a new ring that will accept a small thrust ball bearing, thus eliminating the issue on one side. 

Because of clearance issues, I cannot do the same on the other side, so I'm stuck to using a plain bearing that must take axial loads. The lathe currently has machined surfaces (in steel) to achieve this, however I was wondering if I could reduce the friction by using a brass bearing.

Unfortunately I couldn't find a single source for kinetic friction coefficient of brass on brass, steel on steel and brass on steel so I can make the decision on myself, hence me asking the question here.

45,Timer Circuit Using TPL5111 and N-Channel FET,1534891824,"Hello All,

I am trying to create a circuit that powers an electromagnet (100 Ohms) for 1 hour when a push button is pressed. The electromagnet must receive \~3V at \~30mA  (please don't worry about the AA battery aspect of this, simply just the circuit and if it would work with a constant 3V supply). After 1 hour, the electromagnet should lose all power and not regain power until a user presses the push button again. I have a completed circuit using TPL5110, a p-channel FET, and a 124kOhm resistor that gets the job done. However, after playing around with multiple PCB's with this design, I learned that it is not the most fail-safe design. This is because the P-channel FET is ON when GATE receives a LOW signal. The LOW signal is received from Pin 5 of TPL5110 that sets Pin 5 LOW for a 1 hr time period due to the 124kOhm resistor, all other periods in time Pin 5 is HIGH. I experienced a failure where something went wrong with the nano-timer and Pin 5 stayed low (not sure if it was due to a soldering issue or if the timer chip was damaged). However, I have determined that Pin 5 going LOW is much more like to occur if a failure occurs, than Pin 5 randomly going HIGH when a failure occurs. That being said, I wanted to try and recreate this circuit with TPL5111 that acts like TPL5110, but instead of Pin 5 LOW during the 1 hr period, it is instead HIGH for that 1 hr period.

With the original TPL5110 circuit, I paid an electrical engineer to create the circuit and I have PCB's to test it on. However, before I have the PCB's made with TPL5111, I would like to ask for your opinions on my current drawing. I have had many issues and time delays so I wanted to create the circuit myself. This is how I believe the circuit must be made to ensure the original goal is met (that an electromagnet is powered on for 1 hr, and 1 hr only, when a button is pressed). The additional goal I have for this try at it, is for the electromagnet to receive power only when Pin 5 of TPL5111 is HIGH, and never if Pin 5 goes low for any reason. 

The link below is my best attempt at drawing the schematic I envision. I have also included links to the key components I will be using:

First post here, thought I'd share something I'm thinking about because it's a particularly fun challenge, and might be interesting to see others' opinions.  
I work in an ice research team with around two dozen remote stations out on an ice sheet, and part of what we measure is the amount of surface melt. The weather station sits directly on the ice, so when the surface ice melts, the station moves down with it. To make things a little complicated, the ice is slowly but constantly shifting and moving, so altitude / GPS measurements are subject to too much error. We are looking to get 2cm resolution over about a 15-20m range.

We drill a deep hole to mount temperature sensors on a long string, and at the end of the string we could, in theory, put a beacon that stays fixed at the bottom of the hole. As the ice melts and the station moves closer to the beacon, the distance is measurable. Wireless sensing through ice and snow is difficult but kind of ideal because of the pressure and extreme temperature.

I've drawn a little diagram to illustrate my thinking.

The width will be less than a half inch. I want to cut out sections of the frame sheet to lighten the load, while still maintaining its structure.

In response, I got a lot of pullback. At the moment, I have one senior and one junior in my team. The junior doesn't complain and participates, but the senior exasperated herself after 2 minutes. It went on like this:

- ME: ok guys, here's the problem. We have a to be able to search data on an encrypted database without the ability to use SQL conditions. How do we achieve that? Any ideas?

- SHE (after a few seconds): well, we could fix one of the parameters, bring back a small collection of records and then filter the information using Linq.

- ME: great idea! Just one observation: are we sure we can use Linq to filter encrypted data, or does Linq deciphers it *after* the data is filtered? If the later case is true, how can we still get the same results?

There was a pause, both of them didn't answer, so I pitched in (the solution was to fetch all the records and, eg, store them in an array, which could then be used to filter them in a very simple way):

- ME: anyone?

- SHE (exasperated): oh I don't know Jason... why don't you tell us how to do it? You can also use your own brain to think, you know...

I laughed for a sec (wasn't really in the mood to laugh though), and replied: ""I have an idea but I want to see if you guys can come up with something"".

After that, she closed off and I finished working on it with the junior guy. This is the first thing I attempted, and she reacted like this.

The second thing I suggested was to do a small, in-team project (a very simple game, just for fun) that we can do during work hours, classify it as ""training"" but use it to relax a bit from the usual tasks. The junior was on board with it 100%, while she thought it was just a joke and kind of ignored us.

This is really confusing. A couple of hours later, I noted there was something missing in the database structure and talked to her about it. Her response was: ""yeah, we hadn't talk about it... so... do you want me to put in the extra field...? how do you want it?""

Again, she sounded exasperated. Like she was bothered by the fact I wanted the extra field in the database, but I wasn't forcing her to do it, I was just *talking* to her about it to figure it out together.

78,Evaluate Concept for Race Track Fencing,1534802234,"There was a violent wreck at the IndyCar race at Pocono Raceway yesterday. Driver Robert Wickens sustain several broken bones and other injuries. Driver Ryan Hunter-Ray narrowly avoided what could have been a deadly collision with Wickens racecar as it spun back into the raceway. Both drivers are lucky to be alive. Other drivers were also injured.

Anytime there are incidents like this it spurs discussion about how to improve safety. As with many crashes like this one, a particular area of interest is the catch fencing around the racetrack. The issue with the catch fencing is that it is designed to keep objects from leaving the track, it does little to absorb the energy of impact. When a car hits the fencing its energy is not absorbed but redirected causing violent spinning and G loads. Not only this, but the fencing itself acts like a cheese grater, shredding the car to pieces and creating dangerous debris. [Watching the video of the incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/INDYCAR/comments/98nkar/replay_of_robert_wickens_airborne_into_catch_fence/), you can see both the violent change in direction of the car and the massive amounts of debris created. I propose a solution that uses 2 fencing/netting systems as opposed to a single fence. The first fencing/netting system would serve to absorb the energy of objects leaving the track, while the second fencing/netting system would serve to contain the objects.

A dual fence/net system seeks to borrow from recent improvements to track safety, but apply them to an area of track safety in desperate need of improvement. One of the most notable improvements to track safety in recent years has been the implementation of SAFER barriers. A SAFER barrier system is designed to absorb the force of cars impacting the barrier and safely decelerate them before impacting the concrete wall behind the SAFER barrier. Not only does the SAFER barrier reduce impact for the car and driver, but the reduction of energy also helps to keep the car from rebounding off the wall and back across the racetrack. This reduces the threat of secondary impacts to the car and other cars on the racetrack after the initial impact.

A dual fence/net system would utilize a catch fence for energy absorption and a containment fence to contain debris within the confines of the racetrack. It would operate similar to a SAFER barrier in front of a concrete wall. The catch fence would need to meet a few key criteria and I envision a general construction outlined below. The criteria to keep in mind would be the following:
* Minimal obstruction of view for spectators.
* Designed to adequately absorb energy of a car prior to the car contacting the containment fence.
* Designed to prevent sudden changes in direction of motion of the car as it contacts the fence/netting.
* Constructed from materials that will limit the disintegration of the car as it impacts the fence/netting.
* Designed with minimal elasticity to prevent the car from rebounding back into the raceway.
* System may be designed with failure points that help meet the above criteria, but the system should be repairable after impact within a 1 hour timeframe.

Achieving these criteria will require system design and materials choices that provide maximum flexibility, adequate strength, but limited elasticity.

My thoughts on the design of the catch fence are as follows.
* Hinged posts that allow for flexibility of the entire system. A single direction of motion may not be adequate. The hinge may need to be able to move within 180 degrees of motion to flex with the direction of impact. Posts need to be designed with a direct impact from a racecar in mind. What pivot solutions could work in this application and can they hold up to the force of impacts anticipated? Can a hinge with a single direction of motion work with this application?
* System of netting. Considering netting design options that will provide for maximum flexibility. Material used likely will not be metalic to prevent the car from shedding on impact. What materials and netting design will best achieve the desired results?
* Cabling at the base and top of the netting. The thought is to not fix the netting to the posts but to a cabling system to allow the netting to flex across the entire system. The cabling will be attached to the posts. Once the netting starts to absorb the energy of the impact, it will transfer the energy across the netting, then to the cabling at the bottom and top of the netting. The cables will then transfer energy to the posts and allow the posts to rotate to continue to absorb energy. The cabling will then also serve to hold shape to the netting as the system rotates to keep the car from escaping the netting before enough energy has been absorbed.

With a properly designed catch fence, the containment fence can likely utilize existing designs found at racetracks. This will reduce implementation cost as existing fences can simply be moved further back.

Please evaluate the conceptual design. Can a netting solution reasonably meet the design criteria? If so, does the design outlined seem feasible? Any thoughts on netting materials and netting design? Are there other current applications of fencing/netting that could be looked at when designing this system? One application I am already looking at is rockfall fencing.

M.Eng mechanical engineering from Concordia University canada
have good CAD, FEM, CFD, gas turbine engine knowledge. did not graduate top of my class. gpa is 3.4

Since I did my masters right after my bachelor, I do not have much work experience, only a summer internship working as a technician at a car workshop.

I have been job searching for around 2 months and a half after I graduated from my masters degree. been adding alumni on linkedin and talking to them just as an informational interview about their post and company and what they do. Been applying almost everyday. so far, i am getting close to 200 applications submitted over linkedin, indeed and company job sites. 
Recently I have found an opportunity but it's for a machinist (CNC mill) position, going on an interview for it this week. 

A lot of the other jobs I apply for, I am told that I lack the experience (mechanical assembler, quality agent, method agent at aerospace companies) so i opted to find tier 1 companies/suppliers and gain experience from them for a year or two and then move on.

I am posting here just to talk and see if someone ran into a similar situation and found success. Someone who graduated with an engineering degree and took on a machinist/technician role and managed to find success moving forward.

I just want to know if this machinist job will be worth it or just a waste of time and i should find better.

The job is with a company that manufactures machines for XYZ plants and offers services to fully set up the XYZ plants. I will be working in their manufacturing plant reading blueprints and producing the desired parts under the supervision of a senior machinist.

91,How to remove/reduce silicone from PET sheet extrusion recycle?,1534770129,"Hi engineers,


I have a question more on the plastic engineering side of things. So I've been at my job for about 8 months now and recently, we've been developing a new product with silicone coated PET sheets. This plant has always worked with silicone, but haven't with Polyethylene Terepthalate (PET). 


So, we've been running test trials with silicone coated PET on some of our extruder lines and the way this is devised is let's say we input 2000 lb/hr of virgin PET. I also input 500 lb/hr of recycle PET and virgin PET then another 250 lb/hr of excess edges cut from the outlet of the extruder die. So all together, about 2750 lb/hr of material is inputted but about 1400 lb/hr is ultimately made into sheets. The edges and recycle have silicone in it and the issue with PET is that it masks its optical clarity when silicone and other additives are added.


I want to boost production performance but also want to make this work by removing or reducing the silicone from residual PET. Our yield is falling based on these trial runs and I am unsure of how to improve it without removing recycle and edges completely. Are there any recommendations on how to improve yield and reduce silicone in the PET matrix?",AskEngineers,False,MrGod25,/r/AskEngineers/comments/98tdpo/how_to_removereduce_silicone_from_pet_sheet/

97,Is cold well water ever used for air conditioning?,1534749034,"During the heat wave here in sweden I was so happy to have our heat pump. We bought it to heat our house in winter, but thankfully it'll happily operate in reverse as an AC. 

The AC uses a fair bit of electricity though, so I couldn't help thinking about the fact that the water in our 80 meter deep water well stays at a pretty stable 8-12 °C, which ought to be pretty ideal for air conditioning. Just pump it up, let it cool the house for a bit, and then either let it go to the water heater and save some additional costs on water heating, or just pour it down the drain. I made a half assed attempt by just hooking up a random water/air heat exchanger I had laying around to a tap, and it performed admirably for at least that one room.

I assume not all conditions would favor such a solution. In sweden we've got plenty of water so wasting a little like this is no big deal, but I guess a lot of hot places wouldn't be comfortable wasting water like this. Still, it ought to be a lot cheaper than an electric AC unit to operate, only the water pump and a fan which should at least an order of magnitude lower in energy consumption. Plus maintenance should be almost none. Fans and pumps in my experience have no problems lasting for several decades without needing any kind of intervention, unlike a complex AC unit which seems to have a lot of points of failure.

7,Undergraduate kicking around Graduate school. What's your opinion based on my circumstances?,1534709031,"I'll be elgible to apply for graduate school by next semester. I have a 3.50 GPA, which isn't exactly blowing the world away but I've worked hard for it and I'm proud of it, graduate school only requires a 3.25. I took a semester off of school to do a 6-month internship program which I loved. I think I excelled at it and put a really good foot in the door with the company, and they are keeping me on their radar as they are seeing huge growth right now and would probably see a job offer as soon as I graduate. I plan on getting my PE for Mechanical IF I pass the test.

However, after taking 6 months off for the internship, in order to not kill myself with weird class schedules I had to stretch my classes out to graduate in 9 total semesters (my school doesn't offer some of the classes every semester, some of the classes have prerequisites, just a nightmare in general). This has left me with a smaller class load and my last semester is planned to have only 7 credit hours to graduate. However, the program that I am in offers a B.S./M.S. program that allows you to take your B.S. and M.S. classes together. It's 30 hours of graduate school, 9 of the graduate credit hours can be used towards your bachelor degree, and you would graduate with your bachelors and masters in the same semester. The reason for this is that, since you never graduate with your bachelors while in masters school, you are eligible for scholarships that pay for your masters. I've been told by multiple people that have gone through the program that, if your master's classes aren't paid for 100% with a stipend on top of it, you're doing it wrong.

So money wise, I think that I'm fine in getting it paid for. I could fill that weird gap I have of hardly any classes my last semester with graduate classes and have more of them paid for.

However, I also think I want to get my masters because I would want to specialize in either structural design or hydraulic systems when I enter the work force. I've really enjoyed those subjects in school and they really fascinate me. I got the opportunity to work on both of these subjects at my internship and I would really like to get into the nitty gritty technical side of it.

So, that being said, I have some things to talk about with a few of my professors this semester. I talked to my dad about it and, given the circumstances, he's all for it. He never went to college but in his eyes, more education could never hurt especially if it's all paid for.

But that's why I'm here asking you guys. I don't think that it could hurt me to go ahead and get my masters. I don't know if it would help at all with that initial hiring, but I see it as a way to get where I want want faster within the company I choose to work for.

I have, like a lot of team leaders/managers, a technical background. I was promoted because I was the focal point of the team, the guy who allowed others to produce, the guy who always had a solution to every problem, etc.

All was nice and cool, until I realized I didn’t know squat about managing people. I took a step back and re-evaluated everything.

I think I’m making progress, however, there’s one area I’m still not comfortable with: micromanaging. I’m not against giving people autonomy to do their job, what I don’t like is to give others autonomy until I know they are ready.

- In some cases, team members just don’t care about “improving” their skills, so they remain at a low skill level and yet don’t want to be told how to do their job. If I have to guarantee productivity and high quality on the job, this makes it very hard.

- Another issue is organization. In some instances, I know timelines are tight, so I set down tasks, schedule activites and assign them to my team. And they not always take it well. Too much of this makes them feel “they have to do what I want all the time”. But how can I organize work if I don’t do this?

- code quality: sometimes I code review their code, and whenever I ask them to correct something giving them a logical explanation, their reaction is not always good. Interns don’t complain, but seniors get angry that “they have to write code the way I want”.

I corrected a coworker’s code once because he had mixed try/catch blocks and if/else blocks to handle errors: it was unmaintainable and not all error cases were covered because of the mess. I pointed out it could be written better, and asked him to review it and use only one way to handle errors.

Job A :  
Pros:

1) 20 minutes from home.  
2) Pretty much a set schedule.  
3) I get along decently with everyone I met.  
4) They're a nationwide company so I can transfer to another state if there is a position open.  
5) I will get experience in things I have never done before (welding, for example).  
6) Different job title that looks better on resume.  
7) More time with my family.

Cons:

1) I am the closest Engineer so if something goes wrong or someone needs to work late it will most probably be me.  
2) 2 weeks after the panel interview I called and they said I was the top candidate, but they were hoping to find better. I didn't hear from them the entire two weeks before the call. I had to call them (they told me to do so as they're known for never calling). They reposted the job the same day. 3 days later I got another panel interview and a job offer the next day.   
3) If they ever lose their need for me I may be out of a job if I haven't applied to another location beforehand.  
4) All decisions come from their ""mother"" company in another state.  
5) Vacation isn't considered sacred and you will most probably work during it (on the phone or computer).

Job B:  
Pros:  


1) I get along really well with everyone.  
2) They understand I have two medically needy kids and are completely okay with that (the reporting manager also has a medically needy child).  
3) A definitely set schedule.  
4) Good career advancement opportunity (The promote from within).  
5) Floater for 3 facilities (more experience potential).  
6) Told I was the #1 candidate and had an offer within the week.  
7) President is on-site.  
8) Vacation is considered sacred and no one will bother you.

Cons:

1) Less time at home.  
2) 1hr-1.5hrs drive.  
3) Toll, gas, and insurance costs go up exponentially.  
4) Job title doesn't help resume growth.  
5) Only companies within the same state.  
6) Due to the drive time and work hours I will need to buy a second car ASAP.

I’m planning on applying to several schools as I want to maximize my chances at making it.

I believe I can achieve more. Should I take the risk of skipping these early companies and apply for the better ones.

I understand this is a massive ask, but I'd like at least a high-level understanding of the processes, underlying physics, and an overview of historic/current/upcoming process technologies. 

A bit about me -- Materials Science PhD, and my work was mainly in CVD, spectroscopy (without getting into specifics) of 2D nanomaterials, and Li-ion batteries. Founded a Li-ion startup after PhD and did that for 4 years. After moving on from the startup, tried finding a job in the battery industry for 6 months, but decided it was better to make a move to semiconductors (just moved to CA). The company I now work for makes process equipment for backend processes.

Trying to determine if it is realistic to have the weight of the walls, rubber mulch (for falling on), people, and occasional weather on the rooftop deck.

The rubber is about 25 Lbs./sf for 1 cubic foot of mulch. 
The walls are roughly 15 Lbs./sf of wall material. At 12 feet tall, they’d weigh approx. 180 Lbs per linear foot. 
Guessing at 80 people near max occup. @ 200 Lbs.  per person

I’m hoping the for approx. 580 linear feet of wall within a 10,800SF space. That comes out to 104,400 Lbs of wall, 270,000 Lbs. Of mulch and 16,000 Lbs. Of people. 

Total weight of 390,400 Lbs over 10,800 sf for 36 Lbs/SF. 

That seems like an absurd amount of weight for a rooftop deck, but let me know your thoughts. 

My other idea is to approach a multi level parking garage. I would think those would be more likely to be able to hold that weight?

I graduated from a small school with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and have been working for a little over a year now as an engineer at an aftermarket automotive parts company. Since the company just sources parts from overseas for the most part, it's less engineering and more supplier management/product validation (reviewing prints, measuring parts to make sure they match the sample, dealing with labor/warranty issues). 

I know this job is making me miserable and have been looking for a more technical ""engineering role"" outside the company, but then I remember that I really DID NOT like engineering school either. I was always a ""do the minimum amount of work required to get by"" type of person and although my GPA was in the low 3s upon graduation, I can't help but feel that I cheated my way through school. I used Chegg all the time, made friends with ""smarter"" people who had the homework answers and copied off of them, and generally did mediocre on tests. I gained little to no understanding on things like thermodynamics/heat transfer/fluid mechanics and really was only good at memorizing general ""math"" formats and approaches for other classes like dynamics and strength of materials. Calc/statics/diff eq was pretty easy.

Along the same lines of being in a professional environment, I haaaaaaaaaaate the idea of being a manager and I'm terrible at delegating tasks. I don't want to be an email jockey and would rather be working with my hands or tackling technical problems,

On the other hand, I love working-on and racing cars as a hobby. I enjoy learning how they work and trying to make them faster. I was one of the team leads for the FSAE team senior year and typically stuff like this motivated me to scrape by in engineering because I had some fantasy that it would lead me to be building race cars. On top of that, the only thing that turned around my overall happiness at school was saying fuck it to my grades junior year and focusing on ""building"" my personal car and taking it to as many autoX and track events as possible. 

Overall, I feel like I just am not cut out to be an engineer or will find happiness being one. I like taking stuff apart and seeing how it works and then putting it back together. I like solving technical issues and the feeling of getting a car or some machine running again after it was broken. I like beating the crap out of that machinery, seeings its limits, and breaking it again so it can be fixed with more improvements. But I feel like this type of ""hands-on"" stuff is limited to technicians/mechanics when it comes to the ""professional"" world. I also can't really chase that "" automotive engineering dream job"" out in Michigan because my SO simply is not interested in moving out there and has her own career too. 

I think if I wasn't raised the way I was (i.e. thinking you'd be a failure if you didn't get a 4 year degree and a white collar job) , I probably would have went into a trade or even become a mechanic. But at the same time, I'm already used to the cushy 60k salary and it really just isn't realistic to leave my ""office"" job for a trade if that means a substantial pay cut.

I am taking steps to make my bathroom more accessible for wheelchair use and am trying to design a better vanity/sink area.

The bathroom will have a double sink quartz countertop that spans the entirety of the wall (70 inches) with a front “apron” of 4 inches that comes down the front side (google apron edge profile to get the idea). I’m not sure what to do when it comes to the sink pipes. I’d like them to be covered for aesthetic reasons, but it can’t interfere with the room needed for a wheelchair to maneuver. 

Enter, the slanted “vanity” which attaches a piece of material slanting back from the apron to the wall – allowing proper room to maneuver while also covering the pipes (john wiley and sons ada vanity provides a good schematic online).

The problem I have with this seemingly great solution is how do I access the plumbing in case of emergency? Destroy the entire slanted vanity to get to it? Can anybody envision a modification to this design that allows easy access without having to take apart the entire vanity?

99,My team is subject to a lot of negative external influence from external coworkers in spite of our high performance. How can I protect myself from potential complaints?,1534444658,"Ok, here we go: I’m a guy who acts as a team leader (always, official title!) and **project manager** (some projects), my team was formed by two women and me last year, and both became, eventually, friends.

Becoming friends made it difficult when I had to reprimend one or tell them to do their tasks and stop “helping each other” if the “helping” was just enabling bad behavior. Eg, woman A wouldn’t study something because the other one was better at it, even though woman A needed to know it anyway.

Eventually one of them got transferred after she tried to undermine me and get me to lose my position. The other one remained, and I got a new guy as a replacement.

I recently found out, however, that the woman who works with me regularily chats with the other one about me and my “negative sides”.

The one who got transferred, in turn, spills all of this to other people in the company, and it already got to my manager.

For example, during one of this chit chat events, my manager’s secretary (another close friend of the ex-team member, and an ex PM who couldn’t do her job and got demoted) is now suggesting that they tell my coworker to talk to my manager about me because “I’m not in charge and I need to stop treating my team members like interns”

All of this is worrying me because the whole thing is aimed at undermining me, and it’s done by people who aren’t even working with me.

How on earth can I protect myself against this and go to work with complete ease? I can take my team members complaining about me because, well, I’m the boss so that’s to be expected, but I cannot tolerate that every single complian is a tragedy blown out of proportion because it’ll end up costing me my position.

And the woman who’s enabling this is using it to cover her own ass. If I end up as the dictator asshole who wants to boss other people around, her own deficiencies, that actually require being bossed around, can be forgiven...

So, she strikes from afar, saying “see? Not even her current saint of a coworker can tolerate him...”, spin, casually, in the direction of my manager...

And I swear to god, if i lose my position because of this, I’m gonna raise so much hell with the owners that these two will either get fired or seriously reprimended... but I don’t want that.

What can I do guys? Any advice?

Would this be technically correct? Also +1000 meme points if someone can find a government/education research article I can cite/read for my personal research that has an equation similar to this (or this simple)! :)

If you want a rough linear **(Ambient ° inside = Ambient ° outside)** equation for total energy cost: **(((((((100% - efficiency of your cooling %) / 100) + 1) \* kWh energy consumption indoors) + kWh energy consumption indoors) \* Price of kilowatt-hour) + (Price of kilowatt-hour \* kWh of energy consumption outdoors)** assuming your insulation is 100% efficient. In reality, that equation is almost never linear, but exponentially more from the delta of increasing outdoor temperature vs. the temperature you want it indoors below the outdoor ambient.Otherwise, your total energy cost when the outdoor ambient becomes less than indoor ambient enough that the insulation becomes 0% efficient would be about 1/2 what it is during the inverse (assuming you don't run a electric heater indoors.)It really depends where you live to calculate a/c costs though.

I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for the last few months. I find engineering to be interesting, and was able to keep up with a very, very strenuous workload last semester. By now 99% of the magic has faded and I don't have the same interest I did last semester.

I just started school this past week, and already feel stressed and depressed in spite of my best efforts to curb anxiety. My best efforts never even cured it, really, so going back to school just adds more to the plate that I can't work through I guess. I thought that part-time classes would not be too strenuous, however, mentally, it is just a burden. I get bad racing thoughts related to engineering and just don't want to do much else. Other activities don't seem to lessen this. Not doing anything leads to depression but when I'm not worried about engineering I at least find it easier to do other things. I've always had healthy habits related to working out, eating, etc. I just need some sort of direction in life, so I can't rule out school forever... Have to be an adult at some point.

I am considering trying to persevere through this in hope that the anxiety/depression will lessen and in pursuit of good pay and ""comfortable living.""

Today during one of my classes in school I had an idea. I had been bored since the class had started, and my eyes were drawn too my teachers desk toy, a small drinking bird. For those of you who do not know what this is, I attached a [link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYpbDpkfDcAhWJzIMKHaG9CLkQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3ASipping_Bird.jpg&amp;psig=AOvVaw15A46rvZmzvjOT9kjYa0Jy&amp;ust=1534459659274920) to a photo to this post.

It occurred to me that the toy moved without any source of energy, and rather confused by this idea I found that it is actually powered by a simple mechanism called a heat engine. It is a simple matter of water evaporation. This page on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_bird) explains the process by which motion is generated in the toy.

27,I can't make up my mind,1534374978,"Short intro: I am studying at a University in Egypt (not the most technologically advanced country out there) and currently choosing between aerospace and mechanical but can't make up my mind at all. After looking at the curriculum of both degrees I am sure that I'll be enjoying aerospace more, atleast curriculum wise (they are similar though)

Now I'll try to explain the situation as briefly as possible. The job prospects in the aerospace industry in my country are none and I might be treated like an incompetent mechanical engineer. On the other hand, mechanical engineers can work in power plants, HVAC, plumbing, consumer goods industry, petroleum and natural gas industry and basically the jack of all trades. Moreover, if I chose aerospace engineering, interning abroad would be my only option, obviously. However, I intend on going abroad after my bachelor anyway either through masters or a graduate program at a company someplace, so eventually, benefitting from an aerospace degree is still possible. I could do bachelors in mechanical and masters in aerospace but I am not sure if that's the way to go.

You're probably thinking that mechanical is a no-brainer in my case but the thing is, in my opinion, aircrafts are the most complex machines out there, adding the safety factors and grave risks in this field, aerospace engineers should be experts in the disciplines involved, be it structures, control and flight mechanics, propulsion or aerodynamics. These disciplines have other applications in other fields.

42,Sharp Bump Suspension Problem Question,1534348196,"So I have a ""simple suspension"" design problem that I'm trying to solve, but for some reason I'm having a very hard time understanding the physics behind it.

The problem is: Say there's a small vehicle with a mass riding on 4 metal wheels (very stiff) each with a spring (damper emmited for simplicity) traveling over flat plates rigidly attached to the ground. However this track has multiple flat plates to make up its entire length and the thickness isn't perfect between each plate so at the point that they meet there is a very sharp step the wheel has to go over (thickness difference is well below the axle height but enough to make a bump). Velocity to the point before the sharp bump is known.

I want to figure out what force is put into the wheels and what the dynamic response of the wheels would be.

I know it heavily depends on spring stiffness but other than that I can't figure how you can calculate the rest. I'm guessing it's an energy balance but I don't know the speed after it hits the bump.

My other thought was a impulse or a jerk problem but I don't know how to define the time differential it takes for the springs to compress or how long the force would be applied for.

49,Making my own clamping squares - how and where should I reinforce?,1534330069,"I asked this on /r/DIY but I haven't gotten any answers on working with what I got:  

I'm making the squares of a steel pipe and there's going to be two that can be clamped to the inside, and two on the outside.  
It's to make wood square before gluing/drilling.

https://i.imgur.com/LQ1WzDg.jpg

In the picture I just cut it so I could  bend it square, but I'll make it a butt joint. If there's no obstruction from the reinforcements, on the inside/outside, I could use all four on the inside/outside of what I'm clamping. But they'll probably be stronger if I put brackets on the outside for an outside square, and brackets on the inside for an inside square.


I'm cutting them by hand with a small hacksaw, since I don't have an angle grinder, so the less sawing I have to do, the better.

Unfortunately it's not going to be welded. What I have is a two component steel epoxy putty, and something called chemical metal which is also two components. I'll also be drilling holes to secure the brackets with a threaded rod and nuts.

The one in the picture is 20x20cm (8"") and I think it's going to need reinforcing. If it was 10x10cm then I wouldn't be as worried because I could put brackets on all four sides.

Thanks!

Maybe I should do something like this?

The second one means more sawing and I'll lose some pipe for the extra angle (I only have 200cm pipe in total).

I have two of these corner clamps, one of the big welding square, and four smaller blue ones:  
https://i.imgur.com/jbfjrmz.jpg  

The corner clamps work pretty good at holding things in place but it's difficult to put as much force as you can with regular clamps, and they can't be used for the center of square ups.

I'm making them to square up wood that and to hold things in place. I have some wood that needs to line up over lenght, like 200cm while I glue, drill, or saw.  
I don't know how much force will be put on these but if the wood is twisted or warped it might be a lot (I know it's not great, but I'm not building anything critical/where safety is concerned).  
They'll only be used indoors.  

I'm stuck with the putty, chemical metal, brackets, and threaded rod and nuts.

i have to calculate the power, which should be pretty easy considering we more than what we need.

in the solution it says it should be 1997.15+j1631 Ohms, which is the solution i get when i calulate it with the current times the voltage. but for some reason i just get the right solution if i consider the phase of the current to not be negativ, which shouldnt be the case since it is. 
so my first question is, why that is.

my second one is how i have to deal with complex numbers in general.
sometimes i get the right solution to such problems if i calculate in radiant, and sometimes when i calculate it in 360°.
for example if transform the solution from cartesian coordinates into polar coordinates and than back into cartesian, i have to use radiant to get to my starting point. but if i calculate my first question i have to use 360°.

51,RC car driveshaft and generator,1534317726,"I am thinking about trying a project which may increase my RC car's run time. If it were to work, I don't think I would be able to use it in racing, and even if I was in a league that did not prohibit it, I don't think it would be legal for very long...

1) Build some type of ring magnet around or into the driveshaft of the potential RC car

2) Have a stator that goes around the driveshaft where the ring magnet is located

3) Connect the stator to an inverter to convert the three-phase AC current from the stator into DC current

4) Connect the inverter to a LiPo battery

5) LiPo battery powers the electric drive motor

Would this work? I'm not under the illusion that this would be some sort of overunity or perpetual motion device, but I am wondering if I could capture some of the rotational energy from the driveshaft into electrical energy.

A few other questions:

1) I know may get at least one ""The magnet will produce a load on the driveshaft to the extent you end up with a greater loss of energy than if you had just had a normal driveshaft setup."" Is a magnet sufficient enough to induce current in the stator going to be so heavy that it does this? Come on now...

2) I have seen people talk about losses due to load and friction if you connected an electric vehicle's motor to an alternator to recharge the battery with. So? Ditch the alternator, and just build the alternator INTO the driveshaft itself. There's no need to place the mechanical load of an alternator's shaft onto a driveshaft via belt, chain, magnetic coupling, etc. Just build the rotor into the driveshaft, then place the stator where it is around that part of the driveshaft. Now, that said, how close does a rotor magnet have to be to the stator wiring in order to induce current? Do they have to be touching? Or do they have to at minimum not be touching at all? If it's the latter, how is this producing friction??

73,Should I release clutch (in a manual transmission car) as fast as I can?,1534270316,"I was considering what is the best way to release a clutch in order to minimize its wear. So with my basic knowledge of physics from high school (I’m not a graduate of it yet), it turned out that when you release clutch quickly, the pressure force is greater, then dynamic friction is, but e. g. when you release a clutch twice time faster, the time of connecting clutch with an engine is more or less twice as shorter. So if we assume that the friction coefficient is constant, then the area under chart of the function relating pressure force and time is twice as smaller in case of releasing a clutch twice as fast. So, does it mean that you wear a clutch twice as less? I'm convinced that it is true, but I'm not sure if I kept every important variable in mind. I think that wear of surface is some kind of multiplication between dynamic friction, time and the difference between revs of clutch and engine (in case of this transmission mechanism, we assume that engine's revs are constant). Isn't it? The conclusion of my considering is that you should release clutch as fast as you can, keeping the engine revs as low as possible (until the clutch is connected released fully), but not that fast to stall the engine, it will minimize the wear and acceleration, because static friction will be achieved sooner, then I can use more throttle earlier.

88,Am I understanding a motor burn-out correctly?,1534224876,"Hello, I'm not an engineer but I am trying to understand some engineering concepts. I'm more specifically trying to understand motors.

In my understanding of a motor burn-out,  when a big load is forced on the rotor, the rotor will slow down due to it not physically being able to handle the load. This causes the induction on the rotor to increase due to a greater relative motion between the slow rotor and the fast stator magnetic field (More relative motion = more induction). Thus, when you increase the inductance (L) in the formula XL=2piFL, the inductive reactance of the rotor increases. A higher inductive reactance lowers current. When the rotor has a lower current than the stator, this would decrease the Back-EMF of the rotor, raising EMF and amperage draw on the stator. A high amp draw on the stator will eventually burn it out.

Did I explain this correctly? Please feel free to correct me if I made any mistakes.

Also as a side note: This phenomenon of higher load/torque on the rotor = higher amp draw also explains locked rotor amperage, right?

Big company, but very little collaboration between departments and very niche work.

1. 9-5 job, and not expected to work overtime, good work-life balance.
2. Had good starting salary increases..average salary increase was about 7% and it is starting to plateau.. past 3 years was about 3%
3. Work with extremely smart people, who constantly challenge.
4. Opportunities to travel, but I don't like travel.

Cons: 
1. People don't leave, so promotions are difficult.
2. Politics and people trying to tarnish reputation and gossip.

Typically one might use a gin pole to dismantle section by section and lower but there is some question about the integrity of the tower.  Guy wires run about 140' out in three directions.  Clear field around tower is about 150' in any direction and beyond that is wooded area... so completely dropping the tower doesn't seem like a good route and is just such a crude approach anyhow.

In what clever ways could we do this?  Could we erect a smaller tower as a standoff gin pole and lower the main tower?  Perhaps sever it at the half-height point and allow it to drop into itself so that any resulting collapse or felling would only require 100' clearance?

Even if using a crane, you'd have guys climbing the tower to dismantle, which is questionable with the integrity of the tower.

97,Offered permanent role at dream job but with unfair salary?,1534197385,"Hi,

I recently graduated from university and was fortunate enough to achieve a first class degree in aerospace engineering. On top of this I managed to secure an interview as a graduate design engineer at my dream company in the space sector. Unfortunately I was turned down due to lack of experience, however I pestered them for more detailed feedback and out of the blue they changed their mind and offered me a summer internship instead. I would start a week after my last exam with other summer interns who have not graduated who will return to university in September. The company was not prepared to offer me a graduate salary (60% more than an internship) as I was a risk due to my lack of experience. But said I may be able to secure a permanent graduate role to start with other graduates in September after my internship had finished - provided my performance was up to scratch. This I completely understood, I just felt so fortunate to be given a chance.

I had also been offered a role on a 2 year graduate scheme with graduate salary at an advanced manufacturing research centre to start in September. I always figured this as my back-up incase I did not get the permanent offer at my current company. However, today my line manager approached me and told me how he had been approached by several of my colleagues who have mentioned how well I had been performing and how they need to find a way to keep me on permanently. He then proceeded to offer me a permanent role, but said the company could not afford another graduate salary so I'd continue at an intern's wage until March. Where my performance will be reviewed again and a salary change can be discussed as this is the time when the budgets can be reallocated or something along those lines.

Now I don't want people to think I am only about the money, because that is not the case, but my mind is seriously divided right now. I am not exactly living comfortably, I have little expendable income as the rent in the area is very high for an internship salary. The other manufacturing role have offered to pay me 60% more than I'm earning right now, the company and the role also both interest me, the area is far cheaper, I have friends who are local, I have not experienced any other engineering company and the company is offering me a graduate scheme where I cycle through departments, which sounds really good.

I really, really enjoy the work at the company I'm working for, they have given me tons of responsibility and I feel like I'm learning a lot. I also feel in debt to them as they gave me a chance early in my career. But I feel like I'm worth more than an intern, I do require guidance occasionally, but I'm doing the same jobs as any other non-senior design engineer. Come September the other interns will return to university and the new batch of graduate engineers will arrive, they will be doing identical work to me and I will very likely be showing them the ropes on their first weeks. And yet they will be earning significantly more than me for 6 months, and who's to say I will guarantee get a salary to match theirs in March? The company may delay a salary change even further, or worse; go bust. (The company makes no money and is entirely funded by large investments dependent on technology milestones).

So my question is this:

Is my dream job worth living in cheap shared accommodation in a boring town where I don't know anyone, where it takes me an hour to get to work with trains which get delayed everyday for up to an hour sometimes, for a life style which is hardly more financially stable than being a student? And I'll have to work everyday with people who are doing the exact same work and are just as qualified but will earn 60% more than me for an unforeseeable amount of time? Turning down an alternative well paid graduate scheme at an *alright* company where everything else is superior excluding the actual work itself?

Or should I take my other graduate offer? Is negotiation possible as an intern? Am I just being a spoilt brat?
