1,Surviving Toxic first job. Help,1599003819,"Hi people


I joined a company that makes architectural and interior products for medical environments six months ago as a manufacturing engineer. Initially things seemed fine but soon when some responsibility increased, it has become a really toxic place. The company is a small to mid scale company and the management has some people who just make the job harder. Some of the higher technical supervisors have no intent of mentoring or coaching and just ask questions to put your knowledge down. Other non technical staff is heavily indulged in hatchet play and I myself seem to have turned into some sort of a negative person. 

My direct supervisor is not a technical person but has read some lean books and always tries to impose his perspective all around. I am really sick of this and its starting to show on my personal life now. 

Does it get better or any suggestion how to survive? Is it too soon to switch jobs? How do I ensure that I will have somebody for references for the next job if I get one. Please help, pardon my english it's not my first language. TIA",AskEngineers,False,calligrafer,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ikvrnr/surviving_toxic_first_job_help/

3,How to guide my 13 yo grandson into engineering without pushing,1599003572,"Full disclosure. I’m an engineer, my husband (grandfather) is an engineer. I have 6 siblings, 4 engineers and 2 comp sci. Most of my siblings married engineers. My father was an engineer. We can say that I was born living and breathing engineering.  It is my absolute passion, I loved school, I love my job, I love being an engineer. 

Fast forward and as a mom I was an epic fail. My daughter refused to get near engineering (yes, she had the brains for it) apparently we’re overwhelming when it comes to engineering.  

She has a son. Since he was 4 his been telling me he was going to be an engineer. Life is good. This past summer in his last visit he said he was still interested in a technical field. But that being a technician also interested him. I was ok with this but he commented that his dad (SIL 36) said that college was tough. I love my SIL and I understand where he is coming from, he’s a craftsman, he does beautiful wood work. He tried college and it didn’t suit him. I completely understand and respect that. I would never undermine his parenting. 

My grandson is a good student and he generally enjoys school (ok, name one 13 yo boy that loves school). He has the brains for it, but most importantly, this kid has a great analytical mind. I’m not sure if it’s all the video games he plays, but he really is very good at analyzing and coming up with options. I’d hate for him to go down a path only because of the perceived difficulty of the other options. 

Any suggestions on how to talk to him (and probably SIL) without being pushy or overbearing. And, yes, unfortunately he’s passed the age of wanting to be Tony Stark (already played that card).  He is in his last year of middle school and I think is a critical point to make a decision before high school.

8,"Pathway to PEng (BC, EGBC)",1598998579,"This may be a strange question, but please bear with me. 

I am trying to chart a path to my PEng in BC, Canada. I have an accredited degree from a Canadian school (electrical), as well as Master's &amp; PhDs (Computing Science) from another Canadian school where my research focused on robotics, including a lot of hardware development. I then did a postdoc in mechanical engineering at another prominent Canadian school for 3 years, before ending up in my current job doing engineering work in a small company. 

Although my current work does not require a PEng, it is something I would like to get a) because it would expand the kind of work we can do, and b) it is a goal I have for myself.

The problem is that there are no PEngs at the company, and my only ""work"" with PEngs was ny PostDoc (my supervisor and a colleague). I've been working through the EGBC experience summay write up, and while I feel like a lot of if is lining up well with my experience, I'm worried about the lack of formal ""engineering apprenticeship"" experience I've had. When I was working under a PEng, it was in an academic setting, so we weren't stamping anything...

Looking at the process, I feel like it is tailored to the traditional career path, working at large firms where new employees work their way up under the ranks of experienced licensed engineers (kind of like how lawyers &amp; doctors get their credentials), but it doesn't seem to line up with the small company/start-up experience.

Am I worrying about nothing here? Is there a need to fill in some of these ""gaps"" in my experience, and if so, what are some suggestions?

12,Industrial engineering without a major,1598996177,"Hi everyone! I’m currently a junior in college and I’m trying to figure out my major. I’ve thought I wanted to do engineering for a while because of the cool tangible applications and projects I’ve seen and worked on, but haven’t been able to choose an engineering discipline. I’ve always had an interest in optimization problems, for example planning optimal networks for airlines/railroads or similar optimization work, which has recently led me to thinking that industrial engineering could be the field for me. 

The problem, though, is that my school does not have an industrial engineering major. So realistically thinking about this, i have two options: I could major in mechanical or electrical engineering (probably electrical as I have significant research experience and will be publishing my first paper shortly) and take some optimization courses on the side, which would be difficult time-wise but doable. On the other hand, I could study applied math (which is an excellent program at my school) and keep taking engineering courses that interest me (probably at least 4 more engineering courses over the next few years) while taking optimization, graph theory, statistics classes etc. My school does not offer minors or double majors, so I won’t be able to do that if you were wondering.

So my question is, if I work as an industrial engineer, am I better off with an engineering B.S. with a bit of optimization knowledge or a B.S. in applied math with at least 32 engineering credits?

I’m beginning to enjoy my gen ed’s like Psychology, Philosophy, English and Rhetoric classes more than the STEM’s.

**Background info:** We have a century home with ""poured concrete"" that used field stone from the local area at the time of construction (I say apparent because the few foundation guys I had in all gave me different answers). This being a house built in 1901 who knows how long things have been like this or what kinds of repairs have been completed over the years. 

There is minimal observable moisture or wetness - maybe half a cup throughout the whole year and that's due to location of downspouts.

There is a **crack** under this window and the front window (right window, and left window respectively in bottom picture of imgur). Looks to gradually get larger going from the bottom up. How big of a concern would you think this to be and what product (structural epoxy of some kind - I have obviously researched this but there is one recommended for structural) would work best? 

How serious is the **spalling** at the bottom? Is there a ""structural mortar""?

We had an (unprepared) engineer in to make recommendations but he couldn't think of the product names that he'd recommend and he's since gone on vacation ...

54,Engineering Growth Opportunities - what classes/programs have helped you?,1598935498,"Hi folks,

I am trying to understand how to make best use of a potential opportunity my company is offering me. Management has identified me as someone they want to grow professionally. I have been given a few different directions to think about growing myself in and I need to get back to them with some specific input (e.g. classes, programs) that they could sponsor me for. I would really love some input on classes/programs that you felt were really valuable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Options they have given me:

\- Management programs

\- Negotiation classes

\- Lean (Six Sigma classes)

\- Business Development programs/classes

\- Early Sales / Customer Onboarding

\- New Acquisitions

&amp;#x200B;

They are not going to be able to sponsor a full MBA or degree program as they are still a tiny company (\~150 people) so that's what is making it difficult for me to identify quality classes/programs that would help me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some background about my career:

\- BSME

\- Have mainly worked in Product Development / New Product Introduction

\- Worked with current company since graduating for 4 years &gt; worked for another company for \~3 years &gt; came back to current company \~6months ago 

\- Current company = engineering services + contract manufacturing

\- Current role is Senior Product Development Engineer but as many of you know the reality of working at a small organization is that I do a lot of different things from writing proposals to customers to dealing with manufacturing scrap dispositions in the factory. 

\- I left because I got an offer that was \~50% more than what I was making at the time and I had student loans I needed to pay off. 

\- I came back because I hated where I went and I love where I am. No bad blood when I left and kept in touch while I was away because I genuinely liked the people and the organization. 

\- I do not think I am interested in staying in Operations because frankly I'm sick and tired of end of month and end of quarter hockey sticking but curious if things can get better with different skills/roles. 

\- I am also thinking about how to transition my career beyond Engineering but I confess I am a bit lost with respect to the specific directions as I don't know what I would find more interesting among options that I don't have a lot of experience in. 

&amp;#x200B;

55,New Grad - Weird Position(part time engineering offer),1598935109,"Hi All, 

I need some advice hopefully from experienced engineers or managers on how to proceed. I just graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. During my degree program I held two internships at two companies I will call Company A and Company B.....I also held a teaching assistant position for a semester. My first internship was in medical device reprocessing at a local startup(Company A) during my sophomore year. My second internship was in construction(Company B) and led to a full time offer....they waited until a week before my official full time start date to call me and let me know I would have to work in a part time scenario temporarily due to COVID 19 and how it has impacted my department. My offer was not necessarily rescinded because my hourly pay increased but I am losing out on benefits and the ability to work full time which in turn does not give me enough financial stability to move out and live on my own yet. I am frustrated because I turned down some interviews during the time period between my internship with Company B and the date I expected to go full time with Company B since there is no way I would have imagined my offer being reduced to part time especially since they waited until a week out. Now the interviews I rejected are all ghost and Im sure positions have either already been filled or closed due to COVID. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am stuck because I am lucky to still have a part time engineering position but I feel like no company wants to interview me because I have technically just started a new role. I want to keep this job because I think that offers are extremely hard to come by and I would rather apply on days I do not work or directly after I work. The problem I foresee is that I want to list my job as an internship so I am more attractive to employers but I do not know how ethical that is. Another problem is that I have to travel out of state in 2 weeks for a project in a different state. I will be there for 2 weeks but the time that I will be out of state aligns with the same time my university hosts the engineering career fair(virtual this time) so I won't be able to attend due to my boss being around and I will be out in the field during the time of the career fair. Can someone give me some advice on how to leverage my current situation?

58,Should I continue to search for internships when I already have an offer?,1598932625,"I interned at a nice company this past summer in a mechanical engineering position. Last week they offered me another internship for 2021 but I'm hesitant to take it. There were good benefits and people were friendly, but I didn't like what I was doing and I wouldn't want to do work in that sector again, and though my offer is in a different area I'm nervous I'll still be stuck doing things I don't enjoy.  Most people around me were over stressed and grim, working 12 hour days and frustrated. I strongly don't want to move back to where the job is; I'm from a fairly urban area and the internship is based in a smaller town; the emptiness really brought me down.

The deadline to make a decision is 3 weeks away so I'm either going to accept this or decline it and try my luck on glass door and linked in looking for something else. I believe my resume is fairly strong and with my previous experience and a well known school name I'd like to think I've got a shot, but I know the US is essentially in a recession and the job market may be well screwed for a long time. I don't want to work in a position where I'm miserable when I could be broadening my experiences with other companies that I actually want to work for, but I don't want to sacrifice financial and career security for what may be a pipe dream.

I realize this is a rather inordinate amount of concern for what is essentially only three months, but this will be my last opportunity to gain real experience before graduating, and may determine where/if I work after. I feel that if I accept the offer from my previous employer I'm selling my choice of not only next summer but where I work after graduating- their recent graduate program is very aggressive, they offer their employees full time positions, which is awesome, but only give a couple weeks to accept so if I don't have any other offer then I'll be cornered into it.

So I’ve been accepted into a few engineering programs, today I talked to one advisor and they said it would take a min of 3 years for me to complete the degree (that’s if everything goes smoothly). This is for a B.S in engineering. 

I’m a 23 year old female, 24 next April. Am I too old now? Is it worth it for me to try and do this? I’m feeling so discouraged right now. 

A little about me - I really want to jump into this field, and more importantly complete a bachelors degree. I didn’t have the normal opportunity of just going to college immediately after high school, I jumped through high schools, shitty foster homes, and been working full time since then. I’m currently still on my own, no support system but working an analytics position that treats me like crap  and underpays me. I have done some freelance coding and software development work through self teaching. I struggle a bit with math but that just would take dedication and time, it’s doable with effort. I would take out loans for sure but I’m okay with that. I was also looking at a compsci degree but that doesn’t seem as worth it as an actual engineering degree (which will also be abet accredited). 

I know I’m smart enough to pursue this and more than willing to take the challenge on because I think the benefits will outweigh the costs and help me create a better, happy life for myself instead of barely keeping my head over water.

Window 2: The separator will create a way for the air to come into the room through the top, and leave through the bottom (or vie versa) making it easier for the air to move and therefore much quicker to replace the ""bad"" air in the room.

I'm a recent graduate from the Mechanical Engineering program, and I'm looking to switch gears to pursue a Master's degree in Software or Computer/Electrical Engineering. In my undergrad years, I didn't do much coding. But in my final year working on the Capstone project, I was heavily involved in coding using Matlab/Python to develop a 3D Photogrammetry Scanner. Since then, I've found programming to be relatively fun and I'd like to move into Autonomous Programming. 

I'm currently in the process of applying for enrollment into a Master of Engineering program in the Toronto (Canada) area. Since I'm very indecisive and do not possess much programming background, I thought I'd ask here. My goal is Autonomous Driving Programming, possibly in Perception or Vision. But also, I'm highly interested in Embedded coding despite not knowing much about it. 

As such, I'm looking for industry insights into either of these fields in terms of job prospects around the Toronto area as well as the typical position held by post-graduates from either of the mentioned programs.

I am 2 years out of a bachelors in mechanical engineering in Canada working as a product designer making 70K and I am the lead inventor on a patent application we have submitted. 

I have generally liked the job but I feel like I am not living up to my full potential. I feel like I am not learning enough and will not have the opportunity to do so at this company going forward. I am also worried about the upward mobility.

95,a good way to use ADC when you know beforehand the conversion range doesn't begin from 0V?,1598889549,"Here’s my setup and goal. Of course there’s a practical use case but it gets pretty complicated and optics-related rather than electrical. Here’s the electrical part I am having trouble with:

I have a near-infrared LED light source and a photodiode. I need to measure the intensity of the LED light source with 10 bit precision (0-1023). This is in a room environment where there can be light bulbs and indirect sunlight (ambient light).  

Currently I have a ESP32 doing the ADC conversion with 12 bit precision (0-4095).

I have an optical band-pass filter in front of the photodiode which transfers most of the near-infrared LED light but blocks non-near-infrared ambient light. The issue is incandescent, halogen light bulbs and indirect sunlight have a significant portion of their light still going through the optical band-pass filter. While the filter does its job to reduce the noise from ambient light, indirect sunlight’s influence on the reading is still significant.

The simplest solution won’t work: I can’t simply increase the luminance of my near-infrared LED any further so that it will overpower the near-infrared portion of the indirect sunlight so that I can just use a stronger resistor on the photodiode.

With what I have now my LED reading is 0-400 of the total 0-4095 reading while the indirect sunlight can go all the way to 3000. What I do is check the photodiode readings at moment “n” without the LED On and in moment “n+1” with the LED On and then remove the ambient light reading from the LED reading to get only the LED reading, but this seems like a wasted potential to use a 12 bit DAC to get a sub-8 bit precision LED intensity reading in the end.

I’m thinking there may be a more clever way to use the ADC in a setup like this to get more precision from the voltage range which doesn’t begin from 0V but from the Voltage the ambient light is contributing, or something else.

97,Leaving Full-time for Contract?,1598887714,"Hi all,

Currently I am a Quality Engineer at a med device manufacturer in the US. I've been at this company for \~9 months, it's my first full-time job after graduation. I make $70,000 per year with pretty decent benefits (3% 401(k) match, company contributes $800 to my HSA / year, 21 days PTO, discounted stock buying). I get a 5% bonus at the end of year as well. 

I was contacted by a recruiter for an R&amp;D Engineer position at another med device company that sounded really interesting. I was informed over the phone that the company is doing a company-wide full-time hiring freeze due to COVID, so the position would be a contract with conversion to full-time after 2 years. 

Market rate for this position would be \~$45/hour, no PTO, no paid holidays, minimal opportunity for OT. Assuming I take \~4 weeks off in the year, I'm probably looking at \~$85,000. I would get health insurance through the agency but that would be about it on the benefits front. 

I suppose I'm a bit wary at walking away from a full-time job to a less secure contract position, even if the upside might be higher. From a purely career oriented stand-point, does this seem like an opportunity worth pursuing? I was told that the company in question very rarely doesn't bring on contract engineers full time at contract's end, and from Glassdoor they seem to have great reviews and an exceptional compensation package. 

I think the big pusher for me would be getting out of Quality. My company is growing fast right now so there's a lot of process improvement stuff to be done and everyone (including me) wears a lot of different hats; I don't hate my job by any means but I could definitely see how Quality could be way less enjoyable in a more steady-state environment.

After looking for jobs/internships this past few months related to embedded programming or computer engineering itself, I noticed that 90% of jobs are for software developers/engineers and the wages are considerably higher as well. Also with the covid going on, I realized that software guys can transition easily to work from home as opposed to the hardware guys.

I know I could pursue the Computer Engineering and just take some Software Engineering or Computer Science courses, but the thing is, with Computer Engineering, I am required to take some courses that I'm not reallty interested at (ex: electrical circuits, DSP, controls, etc). I would rather spend the money to take software courses.

Now here are my questions:

1. Since I'm already familiar with programming and some concepts of software engineering, is it worth it to go into the software developer route than embedded/hardware developer route? I'm thinking in terms of job security, more job opportunities, better wages, flexible schedules, work remotely, etc.
2. I did a lot of research and noticed that Software Engineering is one of the most in-demand careers currently. Do you think this will just get better and better in the future? Will robotics/embedded engineering be in the same level?
3. What are your opinions in going to bootcamp rather than going to a university? Are there other options? I'm also thinking of working in a company as a hardware guy and transition into software to get work experience. Is this ideal?

34,"electromagnet levitation, axis controls [Help]",1598824803,"good night r/AskEngineers, im a high school student developing a project over magnetic levitation using electromagnets and superconductors, i'm doing this alone and with self thought for the most part but i´ve came across a problem that i didn't find a clear solution yet so here i am.

The project basis as i said uses electromagnets to levitate a plate, in normal circumstances this plate should stay leveled over the electromagnets on a device underneath it , but it should be able to shift along the XYZ axis freely, i came up with an idea to do this but i'm not sure due to lack of knowledge.

In short the idea is using 3 or more EMs (short for electromagnets) and varying their power in order to shift the plate, i.e in a  4 EMs system, two will be set at 100% power and the other 2 at 50% in theory making the plate acquire and angle of 45 degrees.

The system will probably need superconducting parts, either the plate or EMs, again, not sure which one 

i hope i explained it correctly but in case more information is need i made this crude fusion 360 animation.

So far I the only things I learned from school that I liked were kinematics &amp; dynamics of machines, thermo (good teacher made it interesting), and a CREO design class I took freshman year.

I like seeing how things work, all the little pieces, engines, gears &amp; shit. I like the idea of building/designing things and then getting to hold them in my hands. The closes thing I do to this is I build stuff out of wood in my garage.

People like Colinfurze and The Hacksmith do stuff that I imagine I want to do, but I know they do things most companies don't and it would be hard to find a cool job like that.

All I have done is 1 crappy $12 hour internship in an office. It was an hvac based company that barely taught me anything. 80% of the time I just sat browsing youtube and the other 20% of the time they gave me some tiny task in AUTOcad that a kid could do. I barely learned anything
from that internship and I know I won't want to work in an office (unless i get a standing desk, and get to work with some coworkers my age instead of 20 guys all 10+ years older than me)

50,First engineering job and already a secondary opportunity within a week of working here. What to do?,1598807805,"The title essentially says it all. I recently graduated from environmental engineering this past spring. The job market was non-existant and up until about a month ago I was getting a little hopeless. I applied for every online posting around the country that was applicable and cold called 80+ companys in my area. I couldn't speak to someone who was even actively looking.

Anyway, thru the grace of god I finally got a call about a month ago. It was more of a technician position where I would be out doing a lot of field testing. The promise was within a two year period I  would move into a more EIT role and start getting my hours for my designation. It wasn't ideal but it looked better on a resume then bartending. The company was also taking advantage of the current state of the job market and I'm on an hourly wage making just south of 50k/yr if I can get all the hours through the winter. 

Now. Obviously when it rains, it pours. So during my 3rd day on the job (last week) I got an email with a well respective civil land development firm at an EIT level. I took the interview and have now moved into the secondary round sometime this week. My moral dilemma now arises, if it works out and I'm offered the position, do I take it? It obviously looks extremely  bad to the first company but where does your loyalty stand. The first position is a small-ish place of 50-75 employees and the owner personally asked to speak with me about my career goals this week.

After doing a lot of research on the second company and meeting with some of the individuals I would get to work with it seems like a dream job. They also would be offering 15-25k more than the one i'm currently at. No one leaves the second company and most of the co-op students actually all work there after in my city. I also haven't officially been offered the position  but the interview went extremely well and I feel they were trying to sell me by the end.

A fun goal would to be able to interpret a camera sensor data and hook it up to a pinephone to get some sort of rudimentary color input. I realize I might be crazy, but I think it would be my kind of fun project.

My current understanding is that the pixel arrays are amplified and A/D converted and sent to an encoder where it will be sent to a dsp where it will be lightly processed then sent to another DSP or output. 

All of the modules I've found to play around with are more ""plug and play image ready"" type stuff for actually doing stuff with the camera images (arduino, sony boards, etc...) but I want the very last step of my project to be sending the image out to a dev board. I want to get into the trenches with creating my own camera module (probably minus the optics, but maybe that too to expand on my optoelectronics courses in another direction).

Anyone have any place to start. Camera tech is hard to google search because it always leads to photography-based stuff.

73,Should I Leave a small company and work for l3 harris? 75k to 110k. RF Engineer with 6 Years experience.,1598762379,"Hi there, I'm an RF design engineer  and I just put in my notice at a small company because I got an offer at L3harris for nearly 35k more than what I was making.   I was making 75k base pay at the small company and been there for 6 years. Never directly got a yearly 3 % pay bump and barely making the same amount of money from when I started with after inflation. Good positive thing is,  I learned a shit ton. I got a huge array of exposure under my belt. I don't think I would have gotten that much exposure at a larger company. My projects and my inputs were directly into the final product or prototype we were building. but we got so busy lately and I seem to be more of a do'er than a engineer. I understand the pressure my supervisors are in and I try to help them to get things out the door for them, but a lot new duties are things I've never done. so they have to more or less give me just enough info to be able to do the task and get it out the door.  While I am learning, I am not getting a deep understanding. The owner seems to be too cheap to hire good talent so he keeps hiring new people out of college because they are probably cheap and academically inclined instead of salary inclined. Also I like to add there are times I have to do BS labor work or IT work because we don't have anyone else to do it. 

I spoke to my owner yesterday, who is also family member, and he was completely caught off guard. I think he took things to harshly and made me feel like crap for leaving. He was hurt by not giving him a heads up about not wanting to work at his company or giving him a chance to make it right or adjust his pay. But the more I thought about it this weekend he was  in the wrong for the shit pay, and knowing about it. He asked me to think this weekend if there was anything he could do change my mind  both in salary and  adjustment in task responsibility.  

If I stay here, sounds like I can probably ask for a bump, There is now way they will pay me 110k, At most maybe 85 or 90. And I can probably pick and choose the tasks I want to do. my focus is not money I rather work on cool shit than get paid more and be unhappy. 

my main question is, how's L3 harris compared to working for a small company were things are super relaxed, reasonable, but busy? I hear it primarily depends on which dept, which supervisor i'm working for. the dept im reporting is primarily focused on one of my roles that I actually liked a lot. I became quiet an expert in it and there probably isnt many candidates who actually have as much understanding as I do without training. 

I hear some mixed things from google, reddit and glassdoor reviews of l3harris. But based on the questions I asked about the job from the interviewer, everything seem pretty standard. they want to grow a certain dept, so they seem like they need bodies. They actually gave me an offer almost immediately after the interview.  So I know they want me badly, And I'm kinda holding the cards here. I'm hesitate to leave my first company because that is really all I know and I really like my mentors. But I am ready to put in the work, they are willing to train me on anything I don't know, and I don't see how I can be unhappy making 110k, Even with all the BS I see on reviews. Worse case I don't like it, and jump ship in a year or two, and probably get even more money. Worse case They hate me and I get fired, get unemployment and relax until i find another job..  I don't really see any downside except going out of my comfort zone.   

So thoughts any inputs on working for L3harris or any other large defense contractor ? Any red flags other than large company bs? In comparison to a smaller company? Sorry for the longwinided response. I hope this is okay. just been bothering me a lot this weekend.

78,Should COVID alter the start of my engineering career?,1598754424,"Graduated in May. Had an offer lined up with an OEM automotive company. COVID hit and that offer has been put on hold. Been waiting since then for any update but nothing yet. I’ve always checked their website and no new positions have been posted.

I have experience in design and quality from internships but prefer design (which was my where that offer would’ve been in)

I landed an offer with a tier 1 automotive supplier but as a quality engineer. From the sounds of it, a lot of quality engineers dislike their job and I wasn’t to excited about it during my internship.

Because of COVID, should I seriously consider that QE job or wait it out until the previous automotive offer comes along?

I don’t need the money rn but I don’t want to be put on standby if something else crazy happens like a recession starts or this automotive OEM goes on a hiring freeze for 1+ year. 

I don’t desperately need the money but can obviously use it. My main concern is COVID a good reason to give up on my dream design job with that OEM and take a quality role... I’m torn with waiting for what I want vs starting my career.

And if I take this QE, I feel as though it would be hard to enter as a mid level engineer 3 years down the road into a design role...

81,What are your thoughts on my current ideas for improving the image quality and usability of smartphone cameras?,1598746683,"I teach myself technical stuff, look for problems to solve, and brainstorm and look for solutions.

My ideas I thought of for improving smartphone cameras revolve around dynamic range, low light performance, level of detail captured, a non destructive continuous zoom, and usability. Some will serve laymen while others will be for advanced users.

Ideas include:

1. Four base ISO options. They include 25, 200, 1600, and 12800. There's a smartphone from Oppo that has dual base ISO. For high dynamic range scenes, select regions can use a low base ISO circuit used while everywhere else uses a regular or high base ISO circuit.
2. ""Virtual ISO"" and ""Virtual shutter speed."" The first works where the nominal ISO can be different than end output. If in RAW, the ""push"" and pull"" factor from the nominal ISO can be adjusted; it's a form of tone mapping. The second one captures multiple frames for averaging. In each pixel, there's a buffer for storing the exposures made after the ADC. When done, the individual pixel does an average **before** the demosaicing. This will be designed with motion picture in mind. All this can be automated with or without knowledge from the user.
3. The focal length and aperture can be shown in 35mm full frame equivalent mode or nominal mode.
4. An array for a non destructive continuous optical zoom. I have a provisional patent on this idea. The two parts include an array of small sensors to small lenses that overlap. Each pair has a continuously adjustable optical zoom and aperture (1/10 stop intervals). It's enabled through the periscope principle and an electric motor. The idea of the array is to enable the forerunner of using a camera with a larger recording area. Different arrays for different zoom ranges can be used. The maximum aperture will be the same regardless of zoom position on the same array.
5. Aspect ratio grids. Many users unknowingly frame and compose for one aspect ratio and print for another. This can cause important parts of the subject to be cut out. This solution will help users frame in a way that makes sense for more than one aspect ratio (2x3 and 4:3 at the same time for example).
6. Support for external flash units. The flash unit and a bracket can be physically connected to the phone. It'll be useful for eliminating shadows in portraits. The high readout speed from the sensor will help prevent flash banding. Bluetooth for the external flash can be used.
7. For motion picture and stills, the demosaicing takes place before saving in RAW mode. Then a YUV conversion takes place and lossy compression is applied. This is different than the log gamut because there's no chroma subsampling and the numbers after the demosacing are about the same. The motion picture will use LongGOP compression.
8. There'll be no quad Bayer sensors because of the confusion it creates.
9. Advanced users can install filters on the phone camera. It'll cover all the arrays.
10. White balance bracketing. It'll be useful when the user is not sure about leaving a hint of a color cast in or cancelling it out completely. If using JPEG, 3D LUTs for remapping the colors get created to reduce risk of banding.
11. If saving in RAW, the user can use placeholder mode. It works where a downsampled or otherwise pre processed file gets made like JPEG. The user can easily swap out the placeholder file for copying the changes then exporting the end product.
12. If sending motion picture to a color grading team, the RAW format can be exported to the log gamut.

What ideas do you find appealing, unappealing, or are indifferent on? What are your concerns if any? How should I connect to people to help commercialize the good ones? What's your advice in general?

1. Are there any texts for this that I am just missing?

2. How does the ""hear the heartbeat"" function work as seen during typical pregnancy ultrasounds? In this mode, they place a graphical window over the heart region on the image and convert image data to sound data.

3. What algorithms and/or acquisition setups can I use to really increase image quality? In the sample code, they show you can increase quality by doing a number of ray lines, but even when doing 128 ray lines the quality never even comes close to commercial systems that use similar frequencies.

On Earth, where atmospheric pressure is abundant, but evenly distributed (hence why you would need a pump), creating a vacuum creates a low-pressure space, which the high-pressure backflow desires to fill... hence, you get a consistent flow rate through the pump, limited to atmospheric pressure on the backflow.

In outer space, because there's nothing pressuring / encouraging the backflow to move toward the pump, you would get an initial splutter of water ejected from the pump as it spins... and then... nothing.

I thought as a psychiatrist i could be happy but only now i realise i don't want to pursue a career that doesn't involve any maths, physics, i miss playing with numbers and trying to understand mechanichs so much! In Turkey in high school we are taking a very high level math and physics and actually i was really good at it. And i realise that the subjects that kept me in medicine(neurology and pshciatry) doesn't interest me that much to keep me in medicine forever.

I would like to drop my school and change my bachelors for engineering and wouldn't care about the years that i lost but as a family we are having financial problems for years. So i can't go to my parents and say 'Hey i know its been 5 years since i started med school but now i want to change it, can you support me financialy another 4 years for engineering?' 

So i have to finish my degree and make a living out of it, i am thinking about moving to Germany after finishing my school and becoming a doctor there and in the worst scenario i will study engineering when i am financially independent, which will take so many years.

So i think no one would accept me or give me scholarship.

So I'm currently an undergraduate student pursuing my associate's in mechanical engineering so that I can eventually transfer to a university to pursue my bachelor's. I understand mechanical is essentially the broadest branch of engineering in that there are so many options for what you can do in that field. I've heard and read a little about biomechanical engineering, and from my understanding it's a lot about kinesthisiology, prosthetics, etc. That's definitely something I would consider since I'm fascinated by how the body functions mechanically, and it sounds like a dream to be able to able to help people in that way. However, what kind of work is offered in that realm of engineering? Is it worth it to pursue something in that realm if maybe it isn't very popular yet? And more importantly, how would one go about pursuing a degree that focuses in that area? Would I have to attain my bachelor's and then gain some experience in a graduate program focusing in the real of biomechanics?

I've got about three semesters left at community college, I've been maintaining a 4.0 GPA (hopefully I can maintain that at least until I transfer to a university), I've done some cool stuff with NASA in their NCAS program, and I am honestly fascinated by the stuff I'm studying. But I still have no idea where I want to go with mechanical: NASA, Lockheed, or even automotives are all incredible alternatives to biomechanics. However, for some reason I feel that doing research at a university is what calls to me, and I'm under the impression that's what I would be doing if I pursued biomechanical engineering. I digressed a bit, but basically I would love to hear about what real engineers know about this particular field of biomechanical engineering.

I have 15 production lines where each line sends a few digital and analog signals when they cycle.

I have actually done this before but it was decades ago.  The capabilities and sheer volume of the equipment available is overwhelming.  I don't want to waste time going down the wrong road so I was curious to find recommendations.  

I could purchase direct data acquisition equipment and plug it into a PC.  The questions there would be what vendor (national instruments comes up as well as others) and if there is good software to read, manipulate and display the data.  I can program C++ and can figure visual out.

I would somewhat prefer to purchase a PLC to watch all of the equipment and interface a PC to it in order to take off the relevant data and display it.  I'm not sure if a PLC could record the data in enough volume to achieve the goal.  In the long term, the PLC will be more robust and easier to maintain but it might not be able to accomplish the task.

Any thoughts?  Anyone ever do a project with this type of equipment?

In case anyone remembers that post, I as of today accepted an offer letter from one of the millions of jobs I applied for. For the sake of confidentiality, I'm not going to mention the exact title, but it's not technically engineering. It's still very heavily involved in logistics, though. And the salary is higher than the one I had working as an industrial engineer in my previous job.
  
Not sure what else to say... For anyone reading who is in or has been in similar situations, I'm rooting for you. I've never considered myself as a particularly employable or bright person (and still feel this way), and there were many many many moments where I doubted if I'd ever find ANYTHING.  
  
If any of you are particularly in desperate situations, Indeed is a great source. Literally just looking up keywords such as ""remote"" or ""hiring urgently"" provides a lot of results (and I've gotten a lot more responses than expected). They also have resources for job-hunting in general during all this COVID craziness.  
  
I know all of your situations are very different, but please remember to breathe. Whether you're employed or not while hunting, just remember to take care of yourself. I know I didn't, even while I was employed. Start incorporating some exercise into your life if you haven't already. Even just going for an extended walk really helps (it's helped me a lot, at least). I'd apply to a crap ton of jobs a day and would feel very burned out. So exercise and a healthy diet are key for energy.  
  
Idk how useful this post will be for anyone, but I want you to know that I believe in you. It's a marathon, you just have to keep applying and tweaking your applications, etc etc. I'm particularly cynical and pessimistic about myself, so you know I mean what I'm saying.

So the two sides to this are:

1) Soft braking could be better because the brake pad is pressing more lightly into the pad for a longer time so it won't abrade as much.

2) Hard braking could be better because the brakes are rubbing for a shorter time so there is less of a chance for abrasion to occur between the rotor and pad. 

Both methods have to dissipate the same amount of energy so the question revolves around which method will cause more ware to the pad and thus mean they have to be replaced sooner.

So, let me get to my question. I'm trying to design a small tube with a cooling thermos. The liquid in the main cavity (?) will be cooled down by a small amount of liquid nitrogen. I've worked out some numbers and have decided that 9 grams of LNG will be enough to cool down the amount of liquid I'll be putting in the container. 

My problem starts with the expansion ratio of the LNG as it evaporates, because apparently the ratio is about 1:700. The outer wall of the thermos is planned to be 2 mm thick and I doubt any run-of-the-mill clear plastic (PET or polypropylene) will be able to handle the pressure that I came up with, which is about 9 MPa at 273K. 

I have designed the thermos to be filled with LNG so theres a valve and I've been thinking about designing a valve to have it also function as a pressure relief valve. What are your thoughts and opinions?

Thank you!

P.S. : I've worked out the total heat transfer but I couldn't figure out the time it would take to a) cool the liquid inside the container and b) how long it would stay cold. If you have any advice or answer to give on that regard, I'd be happy.

Now that COVID has destroyed the economy, here I am with a graduate degree in engineering, all of this potential,  and only working part time making shit money out of desperation doing something unrelated. I'm wondering if I just destroyed my career, and I'd do anything to turn the clock back and accept the other offer or press my past employer for more information about the job before just accepting. Now, more than ever, I wish I was working as an engineer.

In the mean time, I also have been spending 40+ hours a week self educating and learning skills for the types of jobs that I want. Learned how to code my own website, so that I can put all of the projects there for employers to see. Set up a home lab to build my projects. Now, more than ever, I wish I was working as an engineer and have learned to never just willy nilly accept an offer without knowing what I'm getting myself into. Any tips for me?

91,"Don't know where to go, please help.",1598610052,"I may sound confused, because I really am, please guide me as I am going through upheavals. I completed my B. Tech in ME in june 2019 and got a job in feb 2019 already (campus placement). It was a really great thing for me as the condition of engineering students is really poor in my country, they'll take up any job they can get, even clerk, steno etc. 
Now, I was placed in a company of 190 million USD annual turnover, manufacturer of machinery of raffia industry (i.e. plastic weaving machines), with business in 93 countries. But I wasn't informed about department in which I'll be working (strange, i know). 
When i joined, i was given SCM department. Which i really hated when I saw the actual work, just calling and emails whole day, follow ups, MS Excel, SAP etc. For 3 months i worked in procurement of bought out items for the likes of pressure gauges, nuts and bolts, springs etc. 
Seeing my repetitive requests, i was transferred into Vendor development role, where my responsibility was to decide the vendor for machining items. I liked it in starting (at least it was a bit closer to engineering), I also completed a huge cost reduction project where I established a saving potential of around 700k USD. It was a big news and I was called by the owner of company who asked me to go for machining training in Machine Shop for a few months (and all this happened just because of my numerous requests to HR and my manager, and my good work). 
When I went to shop floor, i loved it, I learnt operating of manual lathe, cylindrical grinder, VMC, 6m CNC lathe, balancing machine etc. along with CNC programming, tooling, fixtures etc. I remained there for around 4 months. 
Now I've got confirmed (I was recruited as a graduate engineer trainee) and also received an increment. But they are again sending me to Vendor development. 
Over this period of time i realised that i like to work on new things and specially on things involving core engineering. I have one drawback that I am not that proficient in CAD softwares (in my company solidworks and draftsight are used), hence I don't think they will let me in the design department (which i think is the real engineering). 
I am going through immense emotional turmoil. 
I can't leave job amid this pandemic, I really need money right now as my family is depending on me.

95,Did your bachelors degree play a major role in where you are today?,1598602947,"I (21M) am a 3rd year mechatronics students, and I'm a pretty miserable one at that, struggle to put in the hours necessary to do well and feel depressed and crushed by my workload so pretty standard, I'm finding it hard to motivate myself because the work I'm doing now I would never want to do even if it made me a thousand bucks a day, I have a flat mate thats doing industrial engineering and he enjoys life, by that I mean has time to go to gym, skate and see his friends in the week as well as take off weekends. Where as I just work every possible hour I can force myself to be at a desk Monday through Sunday, I'm not a very conscientiousness person but I am intelligent and I do believe my intelligence comes from my speed at thinking albeit not the greatest thinker but put me in a rapid problem producing or high stress environment and I can cope like a machine, pretty pissed off I'm only realizing it now but this whole tedious, monotonous, intricate design stuff isn't for me, I can do it but it's not pleasant and nowhere near the standard I see from my peers. I started this degree in hopes of going biomedical because I am incredibly fascinated by biology but did not go the BSC route due to my subject choice(not bio) in school. But now I've got the idea in my head to finish this year as strong as I can but then start over in industrial, see if I can do BSC modules as well or just abandon medical and pristine my happiness of a meaningful job and do that for hopefully as few years as possible but I wouldn't mind if it ending up being 3 or 4 more years because I think I wouldn't be miserable and it's become increasingly clear to me that life doesn't have to just be suffering in hopes of a brighter future. I'm pretty lost as to what I should do because next year would be my final year so I would have to do my thesis, 4th year Machine Design (brought me more grief and sleepless nights than all my exs combined) and E Design which will take hours of commitment as all my electronic modules tend to do. As well as having to get 8 weeks of vac work in before I graduate so no holiday time for me:(. And I do not think that I could handle that. But alas I'm on this road and unsure whether to change roads and lengthen my student years and get left behind by my peers or stick with them since they've carried me through the years. I'm definitely not adult enough to manage final year but maybe I will be next year, but I see so much sadness and misery in my life by following this path, but there's also a lengthy unknown path that I could pick and I'm fine with that being miserable because I'd have at least have some leisure time which is what used to get me through the suffering however now I just suffer for leisure time that never comes its way in the future and that future is already getting filled up with vac work and whatever else I'm supposed to be doing to be an okay human.
I know nobody can give me an answer and inevitably the choice I make will be the most authentic choice to make but I'm really torn between suffering for a future that may lead to more suffering but has its treasures or lengthening my suffering period but reducing the potency(swap to industrial second year). I am definitely not cut out to be an engineer I was great at highschool maths and being quick off the mark but beyond that my skillset got me into this and I'm not sure they can carry my through and I definitely would fire myself if I was the mechatronic engineer working anyway, I can keep everything in order at face value but getting things to work in the real life is not fun for me I definitely prefer eyeballing my measurements instead of doing it properly if that makes sense so I shouldn't become an engineer.

TLDR
Do I force myself through my final year to get this degree to prove to others that I am smart and can work hard. 
Or
Stop killing myself on this grindstone and take my time(add 2 more years) switch majors and maybe find something I do enjoy.

After a couple of years I obtained a diploma (associate degree) in mechatronics, thinking mechatronics positions would allow me to capitalize on my mechanical experience while getting exposure to electrical work.  

I’ve worked in the autonomous subsea robotics field for a couple of years since the diploma, and I just haven’t gotten the amount of electrical work I really want.  I’ve started to apply for Electrical Design/Hardware Design jobs in my area (major city in Canada) but most of the postings say “BEng Electrical Engineering” required.  I’ve gotten a few interviews so far but no offers.  

I have interviewed for almost every Mechatronics position I’ve applied for, but even when the job postings sound very strongly EE, upon interviewing I discover what they’re actually looking for is a mechanical engineer who can communicate with their EE’s.

I am at a place now where I need to start making some decisions.  My questions are:

* Do I start looking at doing another undergraduate degree in EE, at an M.Eng (Coursework based Masters), or M.Sc (Thesis based Masters)?
* Masters degrees tend to be highly specialized, will I be employable in a sub-field of EE that is not related to the work I did for the Masters?
* Do you or anyone you know successfully managed to make the hop from mechanical to electrical engineering, and how did they do it?

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

7,Use of a PE Seal-Louisiana,1598584063,"    I’ve noticed over the last few years of working in the oil and gas industry that engineering work (corrosion assessments, repair plans, derated SWLs, modification plans, etc) is generally not sealed. I’ve asked a number of people in my sector in particular (we deal with cranes on offshore platforms) and the general consensus among the grey beard engineers is that “I never stamp unless it’s absolutely required by the customer, and then there’s a separate charge associated with it.”
     Now that I hold a PE in the state of LA myself, I’ve been digging through the LAPELS Board rules and trying to stay on the straight and narrow. That leads to two questions:
     (1) First and foremost, why is it that people (operations personnel/engineers) seem to believe that the PE seal can be sold as an optional accessory? The Rules state that all engineering work leaving a firm shall be signed, sealed, and dated by the engineer of record. 
    (2) The Rules give a provision for “when a seal is no longer necessary” such that the seal can be removed and replaced with a note that gives the original engineer’s name and license number  and stares that the seal has been removed.

While I do have about 9 months of technical work experience (which I realize is not a lot, but more than most of my peers), I still have almost no clue what I want to do. 

I’ve worked for two different private corps - an internship doing DOE contracting, and a co-op/internship doing DOD contracting. I liked both of those jobs, but neither made me think “this is it, this is my path”. 

I am getting incredibly scared over the thought of picking my first full time job because I don’t want to get “stuck” in an industry and realize later on that I want to do something else. I recently got my TS so I almost feel obligated to go DOD, but I’m not sure that it’s the perfect path for me. 

Basically, my main question is: 

If I start out in DOD/government type work, will it be difficult for me to move to private corporation later on? And vice versa, if I start out in the private sector doing commercial work, will it be impossible for me to move back into a DOD type role? Will I be stuck in a certain industry (ie. automobiles, aviation, maritime, etc.) if I spend my first 2-5 years working in it?

20,When will engineers on reddit stop assuming that all CS majors are inferior?,1598563796,"I am a grad student in robotics and AI research. Before I start, I am not tooting my own horn, I am offering my side. I see a lot of Redditors on here, and other related subreddits (eng. majors), that assume that most CS majors or professionals chose CS because it was easier. I am sure there are some of you who don’t think that, but I do want to clarify some things, because I’m getting a little tired of seeing this trend: 

I work on learning algorithms for robots because I am interested in AI and how we think. I knew I wanted to go into robotics for awhile, and considered EE. I, and many of my peers, did not find EE interesting enough to study long term OR/AND know that the gap in robotics hardware is almost closed. We pretty much have that electrical and hardware part down, there are definitely improvements to be made but the problems lie in the brain of the robot. If you really want to work with robots, the best problems are related to CS right now. 

That being said, there are a lot of CS majors who are not career obsessed like you have to be for ML research or theoretical thinkers. They may want to learn the basics of programming and get a low stress high paying job. Those who want to go into web development shouldn’t even major in CS at this point, I would recommend a boot camp. 

Roboticists are the rare breed of CS students that (should) understand the machine and the program. Even if you’re not doing low level programming, it helps to build a foundation in e.g. Boolean circuits and understand how to model computation physically. Many of us are no stranger to autoCAD. Many of us have majored in math or even physics. 

I am only arguing who is better or who is smarter, but asking that people on reddit start keeping this in mind. A small amount of us do see the weaknesses of CS programs, but still study it because that’s where the coolest and hardest problems are in robotics. 

Unfortunately, many schools have made their CS programs too easy because of the growing popularity. Even my grad level
computational robotics class didn’t do it for me. Although I took many programming classes, my additional math major is what helped me - and my programming intuition and skills were self taught during internships. So I even see why we are looked down on, but don’t assume that every CS major took the easy way out.",AskEngineers,False,Due-Incident-4072,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ihu0lo/when_will_engineers_on_reddit_stop_assuming_that/

32,VFD for Baldor KL3403,1598557703,"As the title suggests, I am trying to hook up a VFD to a Baldor KL3403. I need the motor to run slower (60~70% of its current RPM) I've done a bit of research and know that because it's an induction motor I probably need to hook it up to a VFD to do this. But I have a couple questions, just to make sure I'm on the right track.

The motor can be configured for 120V or 240V, I currently have it wired up to a switch and have that ran to wall voltage 120VAC at 60Hz. So single phase input. When shopping for VFD I've found a lot that output 3 phase. When looking at a wiring diagram of the motor I see that there are three windings (which explains why when I was setting it up there were 6 wires that you hooked up together) One of the windings (starting?) has a capacitor and switch in series.

Which brings me to my questions:

* Am I right in assuming I can hook the 3 phases of the VFD output to each appropriate motor winding? One phase to one winding, another phase to another winding, etc? 

* What about the capacitor, do I need to remove that from the one winding? Probably take it out and just jump/connect the wires from that? Will this affect the motor starting, or will the VFD take care of that?

* What about the cent switch, do I need to remove that too? If I can't access it physically, probably wire the hot from the VFD to what used to wire from the output of the capacitor, and the neutral from the wire coming from the other side of the winding?

* Anything else I should know? And/or can you recommend a particular VFD/ones I should avoid?

For reference, I'm a support engineer who mainly assists customers with RF component integration and verification, but I do get a little bit of R&amp;D and internal process work thrown at me from time to time. Each folder in my main project directory represents a project I've been attached to in some way, either through design review, documentation, RF testing, primary development, or hardware debug. In the past year, I've been attached to 40 different projects. Communication and follow-up work for the customer-facing projects will often persist for several weeks, so in one way or another I'm tracking 3-6 project threads at any one time.

But being that this is my first engineering job out of school (been with them for over 5 years), I'm left to wonder if this sort of pace and split focus is normal at other companies.  


So, my questions to y'all are these:   


1. How many projects have y'all been attached to in the last year? Do you find the quantity overwhelming?  

2. How often do you get caught by scope/schedule creep in your projects? Who is to blame? (e.g. sales, customer, management, etc)

I realized I am unsure what these are. The NAND gate specifically seems like an EE principle. Could someone ELi5 what these functions are so I have a better idea?

&gt;I've described perceptrons as a method for weighing evidence to make decisions. Another way perceptrons can be used is to compute the elementary logical functions we usually think of as underlying computation, functions such as AND, OR, and NAND. For example, suppose we have a perceptron with two inputs, each with weight −2−2, and an overall bias of 33. Here's our perceptron:  
(image of peceptron - see [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html))  
Then we see that input 0000 produces output 11, since (−2)∗0+(−2)∗0+3=3(−2)∗0+(−2)∗0+3=3 is positive. Here, I've introduced the ∗∗ symbol to make the multiplications explicit. Similar calculations show that the inputs 0101 and 1010 produce output 11. But the input 1111 produces output 00, since (−2)∗1+(−2)∗1+3=−1(−2)∗1+(−2)∗1+3=−1 is negative.

63,Jobs through recruiters and head hunters,1598536804,"So I'm working the kinks out in a job offer, fingers crossed it doesn't fall through, but I've been applying elsewhere just in case. Found a job that I needed to apply for on ziprecruiter so I made an account, and while I was there did some 1-click applying, because why not?

So a couple days of doing this I got a few calls, like within 10-15 minutes of applying to some of these jobs, which felt a little fishy. The first couple calls were offering kind of an insultingly low amount of money (I'm finishing my PhD), and an hourly wage, which also felt fishy. Also based on the keywords used by these guys it's clear these are all for the same job, despite some slightly different labels. So one calls and offers a reasonable hourly rate, so I press on. He says my resume matches up really well, and he thinks he can get me an interview so he'll send over the authorization form for me to allow him to forward my resume and experience to the employer.

I get the authorization email and it's bonkers with some really wacky stuff:

* if I get the job I have to accept it
* set hourly rate that I'm agreeing to right now
* no PTO
* set 12 month contract
* hours only paid based on what's approved by the employer
* my benefits and insurance will be handled by this recruiting company instead of the employer
* if I misrepresent myself or breach any of this they can sue me

So as I started to ask around I realized this isn't just a whole different avenue for getting hired, it's like a whole different job. This was for a fairly large medical device company- they have lots of normal-looking job listings, but I guess this job was just rented out to headhunters to fill. It's like this recruiting agency is like a really sleazy consulting firm or something, one of my friends referred to companies like this as the ""used car salesmen of consulting"". I'm really lucky I have recently been thoroughly reading through my recent job offer, because if not I wouldn't have thought to read this email as carefully as I did- ""oh he's just forwarding my resume, what's the harm?""

So I looked at other jobs that I've kind of earmarked but haven't applied to yet, and I'm realizing just how few of them are listed by the actual employer. It seems like this shift has been kind of recent, and now it feels like so many science/engineering jobs I guess are being handled by these sketchy recruiting agencies that make you sign your life over to them at the chance of getting a job. I suppose it's too much to ask to just apply to the companies that I want to work at, then actually work FOR those companies and not just be a hired gun.

So my question to this sub is:

How common is this kind of hiring in your fields? Am I being overly-sensitive about this or should I follow my gut and avoid recruiters like this? Do you think COVID has caused more companies to push a lot of STEM jobs out to temp/headhunter positions like this?

71,What Can You Do With An Engineering Physics Degree? Worth it?,1598527260,"#  Background

I am in the process of making up my mind on which engineering discipline to study.

I like chemistry as well as physics, but I don't want to do a purely theoretical degree. I want a degree, where I have the ability to actually ""create"" tangible functional items.

I don't particularly mind the job prospects, as I am sure I will find SOME sort of job. And I want to start my own company regardless.

What I am concerned about, are the things the different degrees will allow me to work with.

# Why Engineering Physics

As I understand it, engineering physics will allow me to choose a path somewhere down the line.

What I would like to work with are subjects such as: Space energy/nuclear energy in space, MEMS, war-robotics, photronics and/or Airborne Wind Energy. At the same time, I want to have a fundamental understanding of the subjects, as I am not happy having to accept ""That is just how it is. It is a rabbit hole if you continue to ask questions. You just have to accept working on this level of abstraction."" And I would also like to be challenged.

On almost all engineering physics/applied physics websites, they give the usual sales pitch of ""Do you want to work with advanced engineering? This degree is perfect for you. This is fundamental in physics plus advanced in engineering.""

But when I search for information on different forums, the sentiments towards the degree is different. Some claim it is simply a physics degree done in an engineering faculty, others claim that it is exactly as the different universities describe it.

(TL:DR;)I would therefore like to know, if engineering physics will allow me to work with the mentioned subjects in a development/real-life/entrepneurial setting, or will it only allow for theoretical research based work, as a normal physics bachelor will?",AskEngineers,False,PersonsNotPeople,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ihj7wp/what_can_you_do_with_an_engineering_physics/

There are some kettles that won’t stop, or take much longer to stop, once the water reaches a rolling boil when the water is filled significantly higher than the “MAX” line, I’ve noticed.

If it was temperature, surely the top would feel the heat even faster since the water is closer to the sensor and the water is at a rolling boil.

I’m pretty sure the mechanism to tell the kettle to stop is on the top lid, because one time I left the lid open and the kettle just kept boiling and boiling even though the water was at a rolling boil already for quite a long time.

I'm finishing up my second summer internship at a defense contractor and I'm not sure that I really like it? My first summer I was just a high school intern and I worked in the company makerspace, and this year I actually did more engineering, specifically MATLAB, data analysis, etc. I enjoy the work that I do but I'm not so sure about the industry. I know I'm already lucky to have 2 internships under my belt going into sophomore year but they process return offers and set deadlines for acceptances so early so I feel like I'll kind of be trapped in this intern cycle with this company until I eventually get hired. However, my interim secret clearance just went through and I think it should become a regular secret clearance soon so I think I can end up being really successful in this industry.

The thing is that I don't really have a passion for the aerospace industry. All throughout highschool I was in the robotics club and I really enjoyed that and doing the design work. I also build 3D printers and I think messing with those and like little micro controllers is so much fun I think I might really enjoy a career in robotics, I'm just afraid I won't be able to transition from aerospace to robotics if I keep going down this path.

Another passion I have is automotive work. I'm a huge car enthusiast and I think it would be awesome to work for some sort of racing team or performance shop because I'm on my school's FSAE team.

I briefly considered changing my major to CS, but apparently my GPA isn't high enough, and while the pay is really really attractive, I'm not sure if I can code all day for the rest of my left.

I guess I just wanna say like despite the fact that I feel that I'm pretty successful so far partially due to luck and partially due to hard work, I don't really know if I'm happy going down the path that I am. I hear defense can be the coolest things that you can do in your career, especially on classified programs but I don't really get excited about the stuff I work on right now.

I'm not sure if I'm delusional thinking about this so much as I'm not even 20 yet and I have so much more of my life in front of me.

1,Engineer to Technician transition?,1598470886,"Hey all! 

There are a lot of posts about taking a technician job to put food on the table while looking for engineering roles, but what about the other way around? Would you go from working as an engineer to working as a technician? I’m currently in that dilemma where it seems appealing to make the switch. 

I’ve worked in a plant as a process engineer for the past year and have really come to like industrial process controls. The place I work doesn’t have a process control engineer position and contracts all of that work out. I don’t see a future here where I can gain enough experience to focus on automation. I’m learning a little bit of it by working with the contractors and our electrical and instrumentation techs, but not as much as I’d like! I’d say approximately 10% of my time is spent on controls. 

A position recently opened up at a competitor for a process control technician. It’d be good experience getting field work and spending more time around controls! I’d likely take a pay cut though.. currently making 74k with a suggested 10% pay bump in the next couple months. Would probably be looking at 60k as a tech with less vacation/benefits overall. 

Would making the jump be beneficial to my career over a 10-year period if I want to be a process controls engineer or should I just keep grinding away at my current job learning as much as I can slowly? It’s not black and white either. Do you have any suggestions on what I should do?

8,How can I add value to my organization?,1598465550,"**BACKGROUND**

I'm an electronics engineer about to hit the third year of my first job.  Specifically, I'm an analog test engineer in defense.  I have no complaints about pay/benefits. 

The people/groups I work with range in experience and expertise.  While they are helpful, they are not always available.  After two years, my group has finally brought in a senior engineer that can give us some guidance/help on projects.  It hasn't been until recently that I feel a bit more competent because someone more experienced is there to help.  


**PROBLEM**

My issue is that I feel that my work doesn't get much visibility.  It's important to the organization but the digital work gets more attention and is a bit more diverse.  There's plenty of crossover between groups.  Some supervisors or project leads don't even know that my work exists or it's lower priority compared to the digital work.  I'm not looking for praise simply to be vain but I'd like to know that my work adds value.  I can admit that my perception may just be conjecture as I've not been told explicitly that ""the analog work doesn't matter"".

I've given thought to leaving so that I could gain experience elsewhere.  One reason being is that the equipment I work on is not widely used in the industry.  It's not like certain software or programming languages that would be used in a variety of places.  I am concerned that my resume may become too niche if I remain.  At the same time there's a bit of fear about interview performance and on job performance as I feel that my technical experience is a bit lacking.  


**REQUEST**

Is it worth it to stick to analog and stay where I am?  While challenging, I don't hate it, I 'd just like to know if it has value here or elsewhere.  I always have my resume in the front of my mind and always want to add to it.  I don't have any clear path, but if asked, I think eventually doing design work would be interesting.

40,How is tuition reimbursement at other companies?,1598409576,"So I got hired into this company in February this year, my first job out of college. One of the big reasons I took the job was the tuition reimbursement plan they offered for earning a master's degree. The plan they had in place was if I were to leave the company within a year of earning my degree, I would have to repay them 100%. Between 1 and 2 years, I would repay 50%. After 2 years I would be free and clear.

Today they updated the tuition assistance plan and it's much worse. Now if I were to leave before 5 years after completing my degree. I would owe 100%, and then every year after that it decreases by 20%. So it takes 9 years after completing my degree in order for me to not owe my company any money.

I feel like this is a horrible deal, but I don't have anything to compare it to as this is the first place I've worked. What are some other common tuition reimbursement plans at other engineering companies? Also, how common is it for a company to pick up that cost if I were to change companies before 9 years?

I have been trying to cut out small 1"" wide pieces from this ingot but I'm facing a really difficult time with getting it cut with the equipment available in our machine shop. We have an Ellis horizontal metal cutting bandsaw in the shop, but the blade keeps snagging and stuttering as it slices through the ingot. The only way to completely cut through the ingot is by frequently stopping the cut, raising the blade and pulling out small chunks of zinc from the blade teeth with a pair of pliers. I am thinking that we need to switch to a coarser TPI blade to cut such a hard and gummy material, probably less than 10 TPI (current blade is 10-14 TPI). However, the machinists in the shop tell me that the machine might be underpowered to handle cutting with a low TPI blade, especially when the fixturing system on the Ellis is a joke. I wanted to ask if anyone here has experience with specifically cutting zinc-aluminum alloys, and could suggest me the proper TPI and feed speed to use. Searching Google gives no specific results and my patience is wearing thin.

The idea is to use either a machine capable of compressing high volumes of air at a low pressure, and port it directly to the inlet on a normal shop compressor. Or using a normal shop compressor to force feed a compressor capable of reaching significantly higher pressures much like the ever present backwoods rigs where people use old fridge compressors as their compressors. 

I know they can handle pressure in at least one direction, but can they handle it coming at them from the other end? Also would this be a viable way to increase the overall cfm at higher pressures? 

Like if you used a blower motor(upright vacuum cleaner motor) with the output bottlenecked down to a small opening in a tank with a Reed valve covering the input, then fed that directly to the inlet on a cheap  3 gallon shop compressor with a 1cfm at 90psi rating.

56,Current Engineer with a BSME Wanting to Transition to ComputerVision/ML Focused Roles.,1598394024,"As the title says-I'm currently an applications engineer working at an automation &amp; robotics company. I primarily focus on our machine/computer vision products, as well as some robots. My role is mainly dealing with the hardware-from an electrical standpoint, and on occasion I write software (either scripts or in-house 'canned' analysis software)

I've been at this role 3+ years, and hold a Bachelor's of Mechanical Engineering from a known university (US-based).

For the past year or so, I've been getting more and more interested/involved in programming-specifically related to computer vision and machine learning. I've gotten a few certifications through my previous university via Coursera in Python related to this. And have been working on some side projects related to programming industrial cameras in Python. I also use .NET C# on occasion in my current role to program cameras/robots if needed. I plan to also get more certifications in C#

I'd like to ultimately join a company that develops their own computer vision or ML solutions, rather than being more of the engineer on the sales team integrating hardware.

It also seems that long term (10+ years into career) I see a lot of technical leaders in ML or CV have had experience in software or have CS degrees.

Now my question is-for those of you in Machine Learning or Computer Vision related software engineering roles, would my experience and knowledge in camera &amp; robotic hardware (from an electrical and some coding) standpoint be enough?

60,"Your opinion on clean software, references and documentation",1598385937,"Hey guys, 


I'm seeking your advice. I have taken the responsibility for an API on an embedded Linux platform. Now I read the code and wonder how much Return by references are used by the people who programmed the API. 

My favorite is that they return a boolean by reference, nothing more or less. Also, they pass values as references and then create the same object again to use it as a reference in a third function. The code illustrates what I mean:

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void func_b(int &amp;b){
    b = 5;
    return;
}

void func_a(int &amp;a){
    int b ;
    func_b(b);
    a = b;
    return;
}

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Return by reference hell ...\n"";
    int a = 0;
    func_a(a);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Return is: "" &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

I understand that return by reference is used to avoid passing complex objects between functions to save memory. But how much is too much? The programmers used this mechanism whenever it is possible. As I'm fairly new to embedded Linux programming and don't know if this is a common pattern.

As I have learned CPP needs explicit memory management (commonly handled in the Deconstructor). But even this is never done in the code. I don't think that this is right. 

The last thing making it hard to understand the code is that it is not commented or properly documented. The specification mostly describes the communication layer of the API but not the inner mechanism and pattern. As I speak to the programmers, most times they say that they think everything is fine and well documented.

70,How to calculate the relationship between the angle in this geometric setup and the radial distance?,1598370650," Hi all engineers!

I'm currently trying to write some Matlab code to draw 3D visuals on a project but I am a bit stuck trying to find a geometric relation.

The setup involves two regular polygons on the XY plane of differing radial sizes centred around the origin (I'm using triangles as the easiest case to visualise). The tips of the inner triangle are connected with segments to the respective points on the outer triangle.

The inner triangle is then rotated some angle ζ about the Z-axis (45 degrees in the example I've provided) with the segments remaining connected.

Here's the diagram for a clearer idea of what's going on: [https://imgur.com/a/FScLhq4](https://imgur.com/a/FScLhq4)

Angle η is the angle formed from the point of the outermost triangle to any point along the connected segment about the origin (0,0).

My question is how does angle η vary with the radial distance from the origin?

At first, I thought it was a simple linear relation (y = mx + c) but upon closer inspection, I realised that as the radial distance approaches radial distance at the outer triangle, the amount of change in η for each step gets smaller and smaller. I thought this might be a logarithmic function but can't see the parameters I would use to describe it.

I also tried substituting the linear equation of the line segment into the circle formula at any distance r (x\^2 + y\^2 = r\^2), I thought I could use this to calculate my x, y points at a radial distance and use Pythagoras to get the angle η but this didn't seem to work either.

He thinks for some of the electronics, it uses the 120v between a pole and ground, and it's getting 213v instead and burning out.

92,Practical insight on the forced ventilation of a sewer main,1598356220,"Greetings. I've been struggling at work to provide a working solution on desulphurisation of a sewage main. The problem lies in getting the necessary amount of air to be treated in the unit.

Some years ago some other engineers studied the problem and thought of the below solution. We are talking about a 20km long gravity concrete pipe, of roughly 2.5 meter diameter, half filled with sewage. Through calculations they sized four blowers, 20.000 m3/h each, for a total of 80.000 m3/h to be sucked from the gravity pipe, above the flowing sewage, in order to create enough negative pressure so that theoretically no air can escape through manholes in the city, since air would only enter through the various openings. The blowers were to be placed at the end of the 20 km line at the wastewater treatment plant.

They also provided four different points of entry for air along the line, roughly at 5, 10, 15 and 20 Kms from the blowers inlet. But along the main sewage line there are hundreds of manhole covers, with openings to allow for air exchange. How can this system work??

The first such cover, from hundreds, is let's say 100 meters from the blowers. It has 12 little holes in the cover, that sum up to about 30 cm2. The last air inlet is 20 Kms away and has let's say a few meters2 area. Why would air not enter through the manholes violently instead of preferring the air inlet works?

Also isnt there a possibility that the fan or the blower will not give the flow required because of the subpressure at its inlet?

I am not even touching on the other issue. At the end of the gravity main sewage line a curtain of plastic drapes was supposed to be installed to cover the main exit of the sewage...

Covering the manholes is not an option since in overflow conditions, there exists the risk for pressure buildup and the covers popping in the air.",AskEngineers,False,doubleplusnormie,/r/AskEngineers/comments/igalfi/practical_insight_on_the_forced_ventilation_of_a/

15,Best path into a career into patent/IP law?,1598322766,"I'm a senior Computer Engineering B.S. student and I've started looking into patent law as a career path. I have research experience at my university but I don't know if the traditional software/computer engineering career is right for me. I have a lot of friends in law school and I find the stuff they're studying fascinating and I have a natural knack for it. I have a little higher than average engineering GPA but nothing like what people going into law school have, so I don't think I'd immediately be a competitive candidate, and I don't think I'd want to take on the debt of law school straight away. 

I think becoming a patent agent might be right for me, as it's a fairly high paying position as far as I'm finding(I live and go to school on the West Coast, so those are the salaries I'm finding) positions for online, but I haven't taken the USPTO patent exam yet, as I can only take it after graduation. I've also found online that most firms that employ patent agents will pay for law school after proving your worth to the firm, which is definitely a plus one for me.

After a decent amount of searching online I've found that most lawyers outside of the elite law schools don't have the best job prospects, but being a patent attorney is something highly sought after, especially in the software/computer engineering field. I don't know how true this is, but I've seen online openings that won't hire someone without prosecution experience and a current USPTO certification, which I will have the latter of a couple of months after graduation. 

So as of right now, my current questions are:

* A) Do firms only employ engineers with a current USPTO patent agent certification or is there a way to ""intern"" at a firm during the year? 

* B) Do firms require experience working as an engineer AND having the USPTO patent agent certification to have any chance of getting hired? Or can you find employment right out of undergrad?

* C) Is it customary for firms to pay for law school for becoming a patent attorney or is this just an occurrence of survivorship bias?

* D) From what I understand, after graduating from law school with a J.D. and a USPTO patent agent certification, you become a patent attorney, but must you still take the state bar exam to become a fully-fledged lawyer?

*Are the job prospects and salary on the West Coast(Bay Area, SoCal, Portland, Seattle) as good as is mentioned elsewhere?

Recently, I have been told that companies (in the USA) likely don't want their engineers to get their license unless they are a project manager or team lead because that means that the company has to take out an insurance plan on you (apparently they have to do this?) which could potentially make you a less desirable candidate if you are licensed. Is there any weight to that?

Which one of these materials will better resist a drop, especially when loaded with a lot of weight? For the sake of an example, a hand-hold-able square box made of either material that you just loaded with a steel cube and then dropped it from a few feet onto concrete.

I know my favorite Milwaukee power tools seem to be made out of PA6 GF30, and those things can fall off the roof even with a few pound battery attached. I have also interacted with PA12 SLS-printed things in my 3D printing experiences.

But whenever I look up PCABS, it seems to be cheaper and have just as high or higher impact resistance. Seems to be really similar overall. Part of the problem is that I don't even know of anything made out of PCABS, so I have no life experience to know how it performs. I know my ABS waste pipe fittings are super tough, but I also know they can shatter/tear especially if they get brittle. Also, I think some toys are made out of thin ABS and those definitely shatter.

My dream job is an aerospace propulsion test engineer, one where I use my hands and my engineering knowledge. I am starting an online master's degree in aerospace engineering today to help me get there. However, I'm not doing much of anything at my current job that I think is helping me get achieve my goal.

45,Need help with ceiling mounted gas spring mic stand (with MS Paint Diagram),1598297752,"I'd like to preface this by saying I am in no way a professional engineer, just a musician trying to solve a problem that's been bugging me for a while. So, I'm looking to mount a mic stand to my ceiling because every floor based mic stand I've tried using thus far hasn't worked given my space constraints. I'd like to model it after those nifty monitor mounts that hold your monitor in whatever position you move it to. That way when I need it I can pull it down into place with relatively low resistance and have it stay in place, and if I don't need it I can push it up against the ceiling so it's up and out of the way. 

Materials wise I was planning on using metal pipe much like they make classic mic stands out of. It would consist of two straight pieces roughly 18 inches that bend each which would give me a little more than 36 inches if everything is extended straight. To allow the joints to bend I'm planning on using pipe fittings with hinges, and for rotational movement I'm planning on having the piece on the ceiling that the stand mounts to rotate. 

My main issue has been finding gas springs that will work with my particular project. I'd prefer to have them be no longer than 10 inches because I feel like that would look clunky with the 18 inch struts. And weight isn't a particular issue either because the full weight of my microphone and mount are well under 10 pounds. I also included a rough sketch of my design that I worked up in MS paint. I think it should work, but it doesn't allow for the best folding action of the stand. I figure if I were to make a cut and a second place for the stand to swivel at the red line it should help, but any feedback on design or where to start looking for gas springs that would suit my needs would be much appreciated!

So you're putting heat into the engine.""

I'm having some trouble understanding how that actually happens. As far as I can see, engine braking does the following:

1. Intake stroke: The piston causes the pressure in the cylinder and intake manifold to decrease, thus decreasing the temperature.
2. Compression stroke: The piston causes the pressure and temperature in the cylinder to increase.
3. Power stroke: The piston causes the pressure and temperature to decrease, cancelling out the effects of the compression stroke.
4. Exhaust stroke: Initially, I think higher pressure air from the exhaust valve rushes into the cylinder, which is then expelled together with the air that was already in the cylinder.

It seems to me like this should cool down the intake manifold and cylinder, rather than heat up the engine. Am I missing something?",AskEngineers,False,NNOTM,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ifm5vd/do_gasoline_engines_heat_up_during_engine_braking/

Is it enough to have one intake pipe for air? or do I also require an outbound pipe at floor level to remove any heavier than air gasses from accumulating? Is there a way to accomplish that process by natural airflow or gravity? For instance, by building into a hillside or berm so there is horizontal airflow ?

As far as I know you can use a transformer to convert the 6 phase transmission down to 3 phase at the substation and do the step down anyways so you wouldn't need to double the substation infrastructure, just use six phase stepdown transformers.

Why aren't we taking advantage of 6 phase power transmission using 6 phase transformers at the substation using existing double circuit lines to upgrade capacity? It seems like this would be the lowest cost way to upgrade line capacity on grids locally but I've only heard about the NY 6 phase experiment in the 90's (where everything worked out great but was decommissioned.)

It's been about 1 month since I started. The team is good; the project is...OK, although I still get bouts of impostor syndrome based on the fact that it uses a completely new programming language that I'm definitely not an expert in, so I'm still basically useless, and my constant irrational self-comparisons to other people, as well as the possibility that the current project ""might not happen next year"" and the stakeholders are looking to ""downsize"" the amount of devs, which I heard on my first scrum meeting with the team, which was of course an amazing thing to hear on the first meeting. Also, I'm currently in the process of getting clearance, but because of a snag and COVID, it's been delayed indefinitely and I can only go on the unclassified ones, which seem to be limited within the company. And I moved to another state for a fresh new start away from all my friends and family, primarily because of this job, so there's that.

96,Should I be afraid of pigeonholing on a 1-year contract job?,1598219289,"Hi everyone, thanks for reading. It’s a long post, but I feel like I should give my entire situation. I recently got my MS in mechanical engineering in May, where a lot of my focus was in thermal design/analysis with good bit of CAD/FEA background. Due to COVID, I haven’t gotten much response from companies I’ve applied to (about 50 apps across 5-10 companies), but I recently got an offer with a large automotive supplier through a engineering contract agency. The pay is decent ($33/hr) and it’s in my hometown, but the role is a Quality Engineer. However, most of my internships and projects were in design engineering, which is what I actually want to do as a career and go into one of the energy, space, defense, and probably automotive fields. 

My question is, do you think it’s a good idea to take this contract job if it’s only for 1 year? I want some professional experience but don’t want to pigeonhole in QA. 

For me, the pros are:
1) It will be nice to have a big name company on my resume, which I don’t currently have. 

2) It’s an opportunity in a rough job market so I don’t know if it’s worth passing up. 

3) While I have plenty experience in design, I don’t have much on the manufacturing side. I think working in QA for a year and working with design and manufacturing engineers to improve on designs/processes could make me more well rounded if I want to work for a company that mass produces products or has complex manufacturing process chains. 

4) It’s only a year contract, so I feel like I can get out fairly easily if I wanted to. 

The cons:
1) This is the obvious one. I don’t want to be pigeonholed in QA, which could lead to a host of repercussions if I want to switch career paths after the year. 

2) It’s not in a field that I love, but also isn’t one I would hate to work in. 

3) Pay isn’t that great, but I need to start making money at this point. 

4) No PTO since it’s a contract. 

If anyone with experience could help me make a decision or give any insight, I’d very much appreciate it. Thanks!

TLDR: I recently graduated and want to work as a design engineer. I got an offer to work as a quality engineer on a 1-year contract.

I am a computer developer and understand a lot of pretty complicated topics that have nothing to do with engineering. Lots of respect for you guys though.

Anyway, down to the question.

There are a ton of exceedingly old aircraft flying the skies today. I'm talking private plains, not the huge commercial ones. Many of the manufacturers don't exist anymore. 

I feel like manufacturing has become incredibly complicated since the invention of computers. While mass fabrication methods were insane even in the 20s and 30s, I am wondering how complicated manufacturing process of just one unit like a single engine would have been. It feels like the parts would have had to have been comparatively simple as heck and somewhat easy to understand.

Hypothetically, if one were to find blueprints for say, a 1940s/1950s private plane and wanted to replicate parts of it on a small scale (say an engine) using the same processes used by those who made them without the giant tools used for mass production, how successful would they be and what kind of hangups would they have? This would be completely from scratch, using the same materials.

0,"Hunting For Internships, Need Some Questions Answered Please",1598214354," 

Hello Everyone,

I am a Mechanical Engineering Student going into my 2nd year at a Community College here in the US. I have started hunting for Summer 2021 internships already but have run into some dilemmas.

1. Most, if not all, internships I looked at wanted their candidates to be pursuing a B.S. in Engineering. I am going to be transferring to a 4 year college in Fall of 2021.....so my question is, should I still apply to internships that require their candidates to be working on a B.S. with resumes that say I am a CC student?? Do recruiters actually care if the candidate is doing their first two years of a B.S. at a CC or a 4-year University?

Internships I looked at ranged from Defense, Construction, Energy; they all had the ""pursuing B.S. in Mechanical Engineering"" listed in the job description.

2) Other than company websites, Indeed, Glassdoor, Monster &amp; Career Fairs, where else can I start finding internships? Listing your own personal experiences in hunting for internships would be great also!

1)Dual orthogonal linear polarization reception, using two separate sub-units with relative orientation of 90 degrees.

2) Efficient radiative coupling over the band from 50 MHz to 500 MHz, with return loss of more than 8 dB over at least 80-320 MHz (i.e. S11 &lt; -8 dB).

* Physics classes I enjoyed in HS: basically everything, my favorites were mechanics, SHM, electromagnetism, quantum physics, thermodynamics/kinetic theory
* I hated learning circuits in school. It's the only part of Physics I disliked. I found Ohm's law, KCL, KVL to be tedious. 
* Math I enjoyed: calculus, trigonometry, vectors &amp; matrices, complex numbers
* Math I did not enjoy: Statistics, combinatronics

If possible, I'd also like to get a graduate education (whether an MS or PhD) since I'm interested in doing research. From my current interests (though this may change in the future) I'd probably like to do an MS/PhD in robotics. 

**PROS** and *CONS* of Mechanical Engineering (for me)

1. **The classes seem really enjoyable and much more fun compared to EE**
2. **If, lets say, I were to work for an aerospace company, and was asked whether I'd like to work on the circuitry or the propulsion systems, I'd pick the latter.** 
3. **I like solving problems intuitively and being able to visualize stuff, ME would be better in this aspect than EE**
4. *In terms of research, all the ""low hanging fruit"" have been picked, so from what I've read here, so there isn't all that interesting problems to work on compared to EE.* 

**PROS** and *CONS* of Electrical Engineering (for me)

1. **More job opportunities, can work in software/AI.** 
2. **Higher salary**
3. **More relevant for the future (?)**
4. **In the unis I'm applying to, majoring in EE allows me to take classes in AI and ML, which I'm really interested in. Also allows me to take more programming classes**
5. **Has more advanced math (from what I've heard) than ME, I like math so this is a plus.** 
6. *The classes don't seem all that enjoyable, plus I hate circuits. I'm afraid I would be miserable*

Before this position, I had done a year long co-op while finishing my degree with a large aerospace company that was offering a salary of 82k (before covid forced them to rescind the offer). However, this role was mostly customer support and required no engineering knowledge on a day to day basis.

The new position would be unclassified engineering work while I await my clearance to do contract work for the US Gov on the space side. This situation is very specific and hard to find accurate numbers online, especially for a new graduate. 

Using online research results in a salary range anywhere from 70-95k for an entry level position but that range is too wide to get any number for my situation. My relative in the industry is suggesting anywhere from 90-100k starting for this opportunity, with no hesitation for coming in too high. They are instructing me to assert a price/range rather than ask for a budget but I am worried about being too high and coming off poorly or being too low and getting low-balled, make it hard to work up from my starting salary.

Is 90-95k reasonable or is that too high to even be considered? Should I ask for their budget and go from there or does that seem like I am avoiding the situation? Any help is appreciated, I am new to this. Sorry for the wall of text, thank you.

77,I received a job offer but I'm not sure of my market value and I want to know if they're lowballing me?,1598124792,"I recently received a job offer for an engineering consultant position at a large engineering consulting firm.  I obtained my engineering PhD in December, and in this particular company you're selling your skillset and intellect so the advanced degree is highly relevant.  I have a pretty impressive publication record (which they noted) and had good rapport with everyone I interviewed with, both on a professional and personal level. The interview process has been proceeding since June, so this has been a long-term interest for both of us.

Here's the problem: I have no idea how to gauge my offer, because there's little data and it conflicts.

They offered me $110K + 3 weeks vacation starting out.  For my city, the cost of living is fairly low and that money would go far. I was careful to let them make the first move in offering salary but since I had to technically apply to a job listing, there was a mandatory spot for ""salary expectations"" and I filled in $105K. So my worry is that if they are overoffering that number, I'm being lowballed. I've also spent six years of graduate school developing a fairly marketable skillset; this wasn't just doing dusty shelf research, it's quite applicable in the real world.

On the other hand, the research I've found for this company on glassdoor in my city (there's a couple of entries) shows an average starting position of around $105K. Most people coming in have PhD's, so that value has already been folded in. Additionally, LinkedIn did not list salary range for this particular position but there are a few complementary jobs here in Phoenix for this company where the average is about that ballpark, and their offered salaries in places like Boston or Menlo Park come nowhere close to this when adjusted for COL. However, the upper end of that range is $127K and I know I was a good candidate that they want pretty badly (they contacted me).

Final piece of info: I have no other offers on the table. There was one small company I was interested in, and I informed them of this movement, but I do not think they have the financial means to meet this offer. I know you're always supposed to negotiate salary but it would truly be a bluff, the amount of money is good, and I can't find any good evidence to point to that says they're lowballing me. They also pay overtime for hours over 40, which is very unusual for American salaried engineers.

78,Should I talk to my boss about a conversation I overheard?,1598124495,"Sorry if this isn’t the right sub for this question, but y’all have been so helpful in the past figured I might try here first.

I took a new job a month ago, seemed like a sweet deal on the surface (pension, $20k delta, great benefits). However, now that I’m here I’ve found out that the organization is having major financial problems and furloughs/layoffs are likely headed our way by the end of the year.

My department is small - about six people- and one of the senior engineers has serious issues with my having been hired despite financial concerns. He mentions my being furloughed frequently and withholds work from me to make me artificially light. 

Last week I had to go into the office to pick up some equipment, and I gave him a heads up I would be there in 20 (he’s there every day). When I got there, he was having a loud (non work related) video call with our boss. I tried to make my presence known by knocking on his cube wall but he didn’t acknowledge me. He then proceeded to tell my boss that hiring me was a bad move and that I’d probably be laid off soon due to lack of work. He said they should have hired someone younger who could have been molded by him from the start. When he got off the call he said “yeah what’s up” with his back to me which implies he knew I was there the whole time.

I feel so flabbergasted and annoyed, I left a secure job during a bad economic time for this one and I don’t want to be the center of this guy’s drama.

85,Is engineering just working with assholes,1598119334,"Background: 

I am a mechanical engineer with 3 years of experience. 

I work at a company that has a lot of turn over. The guy who owns the company is aware and does not care. Typically young engineers are over worked and poorly managed. Obviously because of covid finding a new job is difficult. 

I have worked at this company for 1 year previous I worked at another company for 2 years. At my previous company I worked on a test vehicle collecting accelerometer data, designing parts in SW, making drawing, creating documentation (therory of ops, maint manuals, etc.). So my hand calcs are very rusty and not needed ( I am now spending time outside of work practicing) 


Earlier this week an older engineer assigned me a problem to do. I took way to long to do it. He took time with me to review it but just started editing my excel sheet without saying anything about my problem. 

So I asked “ what are you trying to accomplish with editing this sheet” I was only asking a question nothing rude was meant by it. 

He responded: “finishing the problem you couldn’t finish - it would have taken me a couple of minutes to do this problem” 

My response: “ you also have 20 years of experience “ 

His response: “ this is an undergraduate problem - you want to be an ME2 and yet you couldn’t solve this problem”

My response: “ I told him my intention was not to be rude I was just trying to understand his thought process” 

We continued working... he tried to solve the problem and couldn’t then realized my answer was correct .... in the end he organized my information better than I did. 


My thoughts: 
1. I took too long - yes 
2. I need to practice problem solving - yes and I’ve started that process 
3. I need to organize and present my data better - yes I agree 

At the end of our meeting he could tell I was upset. He just told me we had a communication issue. Then I tried to explain my view and he would not let me talk. He said when I asked my original question I “challenged” him. He also said when I tell him that “I must of misunderstood what he asked” he said that is a trigger for him. He then continued to say how he likes me and thinks I am smart and has worked with many young engineers. How he doesn’t want me to leave the company and that I did a good job on my last project I just struggled this week. 


If you read this entire thing thank you! I am just confused if I did something incorrect? I see where I can improve and I will work on that. If I was rude please tell me.

2) if hard, what can I do to increase my odds? I'm currently studying in Jordan, and working here as an EE is a living nightmare (very minimal amount of job opportunities and the salaries for starting engineers usually hover around $400 here) 

3) I know CCNA isn't that much related to my field, but if I decide to pursue that path and get my CCNP, will it open up better doors for me rather than pursuing a job in an actual EE field? If not, what certifications/exams/courses should I take (besides a PE) to increase my odds as an actual EE in, say, heavy machinery or power electronics for example? 

4) if the odds are in my favor, what city should I first hunt jobs in? I read somewhere that Washington DC and Atlanta have a fairly good starting salary average for electrical engineers, how true is that?

Below is a picture of a painting of a man with a levitating ""Head"".  (His head is actually a bird's nest).   I am trying to turn this into a cool little art statue.

I would like the head to actually levitate.  I was thinking I could place a small magnet in the neck (concealed by the collar) and a magnet at the base of the nest (a little indentation made to place the magnet inside).

However, testing this at home with the just the magnets, the top magnet just goes flying off.  As I am sure we all expected.

Through my research I have only found being achieving levitation in ways that would not work for this statue.  Having a metal rod to guide the top magnet defeats the purpose of the look, I might as well just hold the head in place with a transparant plastic dowel.

Is what I am trying to achieve even possible?  How would you go about it?

Tesla - production associate 
Medical company - manufacturing technician 
Manufacturing company - engineering technician
Rotary die cutter stacker company - IT engineer

I’m heavily considering the Tesla position since I don’t mind working with my hands or for long hours and the role fits well (assembly, diagnostics, troubleshooting, with odd jobs mixed in) and obviously the name will be recognized easily in future applications.

Medical company I’m not as interested in but I got along with the hiring manager, job is easy for me, oscilloscopes, generators, power supply work and again assembly and repair, pay is about the same as Tesla.

Manufacturing company was a startup and wanted to give me an opportunity which could then turn into something else when I get my degree. This one pays even more but the company is relatively unknown and the commute would be rough honestly.

Lastly the IT engineer role for stackers were the kindest people I’ve met, family run business and talked to me like I was friends with them from the get go. They are offering the most money but the work is extremely specialized and I don’t know if that will pigeonhole me in the long run.

I apologize if this was the wrong format or place to ask these kinds of questions but to be honest I’m the first of my family to get this close to graduating and there’s not a lot of people I can reliably turn to for help.

24,How many hours would it take to transition roughly 100 Solidworks files into OnShape?,1598039663,"For context, I am a mechanical team lead of a robotics design team at a University.  Our team currently uses an integrated system with SW as our main CAD software and GrabCAD as our file manager and sharing database. Some of our team members proposed we move to OS saying its easier to use, has better version control, and better collaboration features while still having all essential features and capabilities that SW has. We have a competition in July of 2021, and I would like our team to have full focus on design and manufacturing this year since we are still in middle of a complete re-design of our robots, and we must manufacture 8 robots before the end of January so our software team can run tests on the robot's capabilities.   


After trying OS for a month myself and attempting to transition some files, the main problem that I am having is that I'm not confident that we can complete the transition of our whole file database (which consists of roughly 100 SW parts, assemblies, and drawings) before the start of the school year which is in 2 weeks. As well, our team currently only has 5 active members who are familiar with CAD practice due to many of our senior member graduating last year. Our team leads have decided that we must have everything set up before we finish recruiting new members for our team, hence this concern. I have consulted some family who are senior engineers, as well as the internet, and I have been getting slightly mixed answers about transitioning CAD softwares. Some say that to transition fully, it will take at least an entire year to do and others say that it could be done in a few weeks without problems.

41,Is it possible I broke my load cell with a buildup of static electricity?,1598022924,"Put simply, I have an FC2231 load cell mounted in a PVC tube to make some circumferential force measurements. The load cell is connected to a NI USB DAQ for both power and signal reading. I've been using various silicone pieces over the surface of the tube when I've made my measurements, and my zero load voltages have drifted up. My first instinct is a mechanical deformation, but I just don't see how that applies in this situation. The drift occurred in between individual tests, where I was swapping out silicone pieces, and there was no load applied to the cell that would have exceeded its capacity.

Normally, at 0 load, it should read 0.5 V. It drifted up to 1.6 V at some point in between two tests and after trying to troubleshoot it, it never went back down. After fiddling with it some more, it jumped up to 4.1 V, and then it capped out at 4.5 V. I'm just wondering if maybe I broke it because of static electricity or something, and if there's a way to fix it? Or, if I buy a new one, how to prevent it from happening again (assuming that's the issue)?

67,Former Engineers - How'd It Go?,1597988144,"So, my last couple of years in engineering has really burned the passion right out of me. Most of the higher earning roles around my area are soul-crushing. I'm currently working in a role where I make low six figures, good benefits, profit-sharing, and full remote work option. Honestly, I can't complain about the financial/benefit package, because it is great and I'm well compensated for my age (30 or under). My issue the last year or two has been it doesn't generate any passion in me at all, or any time I get a glimpse of passion, it swiftly gets extinguished by soul-crushing busy-body work.

I'll admit the previous place I worked burned me pretty hard and the current place I work is more of a safe bet, but the fire just doesn't seem to be there. I am not being as innovative as I used to be, because I don't feel like arguing with some old program manager who wants to do it their way. I literally brokered a deal to buy 5 years of obsolete parts from a vendor because they didn't want to invest in new product design and analysis. This really hurt me, because the last time they did this, they didn't really do anything in that time frame, so when their contract was up, they got beat by a competitor. It is hard to show people the problem with products becoming stagnant until it actually starts to affect them.

So, I've been considering changing careers paths, or at least employers. Honestly, I would love a ""jack of all trades"" or many-hats position at a start-up. I honestly look at my past work at start-ups and think, ""this kid used to enjoy making stuff"", versus now I do it to get a paycheck and enjoy my weekend. Frankly, I feel no purpose in my role. The company is big enough where you can become an invisible cog and coast into retirement. I don't know why people choose to do that, but I work with too many to deny it.

68,Graduated with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. Is it worth pursuing a Masters now if I can't find a job in my desired industry?,1597985335,"I graduated this past spring with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech and have since been searching for engineering positions with medical device companies. Despite sending out hundreds of applications and having a small number of interviews over the past 6 months, I haven't been able to land anything. My initial plan was to enter industry with the intention of eventually getting my Masters once I had a bit more practical experience to guide me, especially if a company was willing to pay for it, but now I'm less sure what to do. I'm growing frustrated, especially since all of my friends in other engineering majors have already started their careers with no trouble. Most of my BME classmates have been able to find jobs, but very few of them are doing actual engineering afaik.


So a few questions:

- Given the state of things, would getting my Masters now help my career prospects? I think it would, but I'm unsure if the price + opportunity cost is too high and if I should just keep applying as the economy straightens back out.

- How feasible is switching engineering disciplines with a Masters? I see a lot of potential with electrical engineering or computer science (within medical devices or outside of it), but I'm worried I don't know enough about either discipline to make a strong decision and don't have the work experience to back it up.

- Lastly, is Quality Engineering as bad as everybody says it is? I have an interview coming up for a QE job, and I would almost certainly take it. I'd like to at least try it and figure I could leverage the 1 or 2 years of experience for a different job if I don't.

71,Is doing a Engineering Trade after your Bachelors a waste of time?,1597981218," 

Hi   I just have a slight dilemma and need some help. Now, I didn't study  engineering at university, I studied physics with a major in nuclear  science and technology. I understand it is quite different compared to  engineering, but I thought physics would at least give me a wide range  of skills from mathematics to basic engineering etc, which it has, I've  done basic circuit work, basic coding, basic design of equipment and  I've learnt the ins and outs of mathematics which can be used to explain  the world around me, but I've been left with an itch for engineering.  Now I don't want to go another 4 years to uni to do engineering because  from my perspective I've learnt more alone at home tinkering and reading  books then I have at uni anyway, and I'm not a fan of university  education anymore, I want out of it. I just don't know what to do after  uni, my passion is inventing and that's what I want to do but its like  the world around me and the people around me see that as a stupid thing.  I just want more skills and want to be able to build things that help  people and the world, and I believe wholeheartedly that I have ideas  that can do just that.

Now a trade  apprenticeship came up near my home in cert 3 engineering, it seems  appealing to me because it contains all the hands on work I want to  learn, machining, milling, welding etc, which will all contribute to my  learning. I can take additional courses in the meantime to further my  other skills in electrical circuit making, coding and various others as  well. I know its like 3 years but maybe I can learn a thing or two that  would add to my qualifications? Maybe eventually it could lead to a management position as well?

I  was also thinking maybe as suggested to others on other posts, to do  short courses in each area I want over the course of a year and just  build experience that way whilst working in a job not related to my  education as I want to take next year off.

I  am graduating this year and I saved enough to have pretty much one year  off next year (off of working in my field),  I don't want to waste it  completely, ideally I want to be able to develop my own ideas and  hopefully I can get somewhere with that. I don't want to become one of  those physicists that just does research all day, I want to be able to  build and make things using my knowledge, fix things and invent new  technologies. I just don't know enough about the career world to make a proper judgement for my future.

76,How would Southern California get the power grid (and other infrastructure) back up if the San Andreas ruptured?,1597976889," I’ve been reading about seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones’ Shakeout scenario and I’ve been thinking a lot about the medium-to-longterm aftermath of “the big one,” it’s effects on infrastructure (primarily electrical) and how little I understand it.

Apparently the fault will shift either side of the ground 15-20 feet so obviously anything that crosses directly through it will be destroyed. So it’s easy to see what will happen to the two main freeways into and out of Southern California, rail lines, gas and oil pipelines, data lines, and aqueducts.

I’ve read about what will happen with water. 6 months of water in reserves on this side of fault should buy time to at least, hopefully, to repair the Colorado River aqueduct before we run out as it crosses the fault at a small lake I believe.

**What happens with electricity though?** I hear it will probably take down the entire western United States grid for hours. Not sure how power grids work or why this happens, but apparently everybody else gets their grid back up and running quickly, **but what happens Southern California?**

What’s the expectation and seismic resilience for the kind of interstate high voltage transmission lines that cross the fault? How long do they take to repair or replace? How crucial are they? Is there more capacity to reroute power from Northern California or San Diego? CA imports about 30% of its power during normal usage, about half of that from the Southwest so I’m assuming all of that is likely going to Southern California and crossing the fault at the Cajon Pass. Also, I’m assuming we import most of our natural gas (which comprises 42% of our normal energy production), I hear in Southern California it’s from 4 large pipelines which I also assume cross at the pass and will break. Is it also true that natural gas plants largely rely on a “just in time” delivery of fuel as opposed to coal and nuclear which Southern California doesn’t seem to use. Even if there are is some storage, how long does that last? Could trucks and ships feasibly replace a reasonable capacity lost from pipelines?

To me this seems apocalyptic, like California will suffer incredible damage and disruption to about 75% of its energy supply and that’s not counting damage to transformers, power stations, etc. but most experts seem to merely describe it as disastrous or catastrophic, and that the grid will be up within days and the least hard-hit areas will start having their power restored. But is this realistic? Do these utilities have the manpower and stockpiles? With all that natural gas lost, won’t the pipelines take weeks to repair at least? Are interstate transmission lines that cross the fault expected to survive?",AskEngineers,False,AdamFriedland69,/r/AskEngineers/comments/idob18/how_would_southern_california_get_the_power_grid/
77,Is this desk design structurally sound?,1597975929,"I recently started designing [this desk](https://imgur.com/a/bgASysn) for my home office, so I could get it built by a local woodworker. I've had some feedback, mainly to do with structural concerns, and I'm hoping they're sufficiently addressed now. The tricky part is I don't have a wood species picked out just yet - though I'm leaning towards pine. There should never be more than 100-150lb on the tabletop, with up to 75% being center-back load (monitor mount clamp) in the future.

My other main concern is the left legs - if they get knocked out to the left (by my foot or whatever), it would be a lot of torque on those 2 joints. I added a 4"" tall, 1"" thick skirt to everything but the front, and added those 2 reinforcement triangles on the front. Is this likely to be stable enough?

1. At my old job people worked 70 hour weeks till they were 30 to get a raise to $100k ish... this seems absurdly low to me given the effort and time involved (ie not a good value for their time)

2. I have friends making more than me (not a lot more but more) in different fields doing arguably less work/ less important or impactful things.... I realize this is based on perspective and can just be lucky occurrences but I can’t help but notice. The one doesn’t even have an engineering degree. 

3. Generally speaking it seems like the high end salaries don’t even go that high. Why would I bust my ass for 20+ years just to make (today’s dollars) $120k? Or even $150k? Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like this is a pittance for someone who is likely integral to the companies functioning. This is coming from the perspective of someone who plans to work hard and pursue that next level and not settle; I know it’s not “just” $120k or $150k, but I’m talking relative to effort/value.

Now I want to do the same, and maybe make it even more loaded with stuff. One Idea I had was to make the surface be able to locate the point where the ball hit the table.  
So i looked for touch sensors but the majority seem to be capacative-based and that wouldnt work because the ball is plastic.  
And even if I find sensors that react to force/pressure I would need literally thousands of them to make it somewhat exact?  
Another Idea I had was using IR or maybe even Radar to maybe create some sort of 'map'? Please Excuse me if this is a stupid Idea :D

Does anyone have a very clever and best case cheap solution to this?  
I plan on doing this with a Raspberry in case this is important.

Often they are asking what kind of salary you want upfront.

I have 5 years experience in the space industry, and intend on staying in that industry.

It  looks like with a masters no experience, salaries range from 40K to  60K. Looking around, Ive seen the average salary is about 60K for 5  years experience, and 69K+ for 6 years experience.

Would it be  crazy to ask for 75K and let them counter offer at 60-65 ish? In the US  it is typical to ask for more, with them meeting you someway in the  middle. Would asking for this much hurt my chances massively or would  this be an appropriate amount to ask for?

Often  I am asked my current salary, which is 85K, which is not something I am  going to be able to make in Germany. I worry that answering that makes  them think I am asking for that much... or that I would not be  interested in a ""low"" salary.

I have taken sample measurements of the component (n=10, with a weighing scale of ± 0.01 g precision) and found the following:

Mean =  59.808 g  | SD(sample) = 0.349 g | Variance(sample) = 0.122 g^(2)

Is it correct to assume that given these measurements for n=10, I can expect the following for n = 144

I am unsure whether I should be adding up the variance or the standard deviation. I chose to go with SD since it is was the larger number ( I have read and know that I can't compare SD to variance when units are involved).

My worry is that for 144 pieces, with an expected SD of 50.26 g, the machine has a high probability of counting 143, 144 or 145 as exactly 144 because the component itself weighs only 59.8 g.  

Based on the above, I have drawn the conclusion that I can only reliable count 72 pieces (Expected SD of 25.13 g).

I don't have the most intuitive understanding of statistics and was hoping someone with a better understanding could tell me if there is a flaw in this reasoning of mine.

38,"Why place insulation on the outside of a monolithic dome, rather than the inside?",1597908135,"I've been researching building techniques for high-efficiency off-grid homes, since I intend to build one for myself in the next five years. I've sketched out most of the internal systems and I've been running cost analyses on them, but the actual structure is something I haven't settled on beyond using a thin-shell concrete structure and (possibly) earth-berming or burying the thing. Taking that route, I eventually came across the much-vaunted monolithic dome. Going over the basic design, though, it seems like it would be more sensible to place the insulation *inside* the dome and to seal the concrete shell with some sort of surface treatment or special admixture. That way, the strongest structural component is exposed to the environment while the insulation is kept safe from adverse conditions that might penetrate whatever cladding is used. Sure, you would lose the thermal flywheel effect, but I'm not convinced that's all its cracked up to be. It just means, to my understanding, that you have more thermal ""momentum"" to overcome should you need to heat or cool the space. I understand that the insulation is protected by the airform, but the airform is then itself exposed to environmental damage and it does not appear easy to repair once bonded to the insulation.

My current design idea is to use a high-strength concrete mix with a waterproofing admixture poured/sprayed over basalt rebar, or said mix embedded in a grid of basalt roving, and then to insulate the inside. Treat the surface with additional sealants and maybe a surface membrane of some sort, then finish out the inside. This *seems* more sensible to me than a monolithic dome institute-style approach, but I'm almost certain that I'm wrong.

I'm just about to start my undergrad course in chem eng and with the lockdown still in place, I've taken this as an opportunity to get a headstart on learning some design fundamentals.


I'm working through an online course and stumbelled on this problem;


""A liquid is transferred from a tank (IBC) to reactor 1. This transfer was found to be operating at low flow rate of 1.5L/min. The designed flowrate is as 60L/min - how you would look at investigating and resolving the low flow issue""

Schematic - https://i.imgur.com/AeR0WBx.png

- possibility that the solvent in IBC is not the correct fluid (Therefore check the solvent)

- 1st thing I can suggest is its possible your pump isn't strong enough; this could be due to the design of the system (NPSHr &gt; NPSHa which would cause excessive cavitation and degradation of pump performance. If this was the fault, the pump could be an element to be investigated.

- Potential fault in the compressed air line to the pump, reducing the performance in mass transfer. Can be identified by the pressure gauge. 

- Assuming reactor 2 and 3 achieved the designed flow rates, it would seem there is an issue with the pipe following reactor 2. This could be investigated by inspecting the pipe for any leaks/damage. Likewise, perhaps there is an issue with one or both of the actuated valves after reactor 2.


Are there any other possible faults or points that I could expand on?

55,I do not understand valve control authority.,1597880271,"dP = pressure drop

So I have been sizing some 2"", 3"" globe-style flow control valves to ISA75.01.01 and have come across the term of control authority, (N = dP_valve / dP_system). And apparently an authority &lt; 0.25 will give you unstable control.

Is this something which I should actually be worrying about? There doesn't seem to be much on it online. Nor is it mentioned in the standard?

The physical mechanism doesn't make sense to me either, why does it happen? What exactly does ""unstable"" mean? I've read that a valve with low control authority may begin to behave more like an on-off valve rather than a throttle valve. So it only has any influence on the mass flow at the last few % before closing. Again, why? And this doesn't sound related to control stability?

Also, how do you define what the dP of the system is if you have an open loop pipe network? It's not always obvious when I have multiple control valves, heat exchangers and pumps all in a mixture of series and parallel.

Finally, apparently you should use the pressure drop over the valve at 100% open in the control authority equation. Why is this? If my valve is modulating at around 60% open at max, why do I care about it's behaviour at 100%?

65,How are vehicle tow capacities calculated?,1597867935,"So I have had some back and forth with the Department of Transport and Main Roads in QLD about exactly how they come to vehicle tow ratings, and how they are worked out.

Before getting too in depth, essentially with his cheap and accessible electric motors and axles are now, as well as EV capable batteries, I believe it wouldn't be hard to make an essentially floating trailer vehicle my car with torque vectored steering, and utilising the regenerative braking to assist in the braking of the trailer, charge the batteries, and if you're towing with a BEV or HEV, charge the car with regen as well.

I honestly thought it would be a simple question, but I've received responses from ""Because the car has to pull that weight"" which really, to me if the trailer is self propelled the car wouldn't be pulling that weight. The trailer would be pushing its own weight.

The other one was ""But the car has to stop the trailer"", well no, as the regenerative brakes and the brakes on the trailer would be fundamentally and performance wise the same as the car. If the car cam brake it's own weight, the trailer would brake a similar weight to what the car can.

From what I can gather they are looking at trailers in an entirely passive way, as if a trailer is no more than a passive participant in the towing activity.

Could someone point me to something that would help me discuss active trailers? How the calculations for weight on the vehicle would work there?

For the interested, I'm looking to have the throttle controls passed from the car to the trailer via CANBUS that's existing already in the vehicle. So throttle and brake will be passed over by that, I need to confirm the steering box, but I believe I do have electronic steering in there somewhere, that will allow the trailer to also torque vector and ideally also be able to jump onto the vehicles stability control and keep everything stable as hell.

To me all this seems fairly straightforward in theory, but I think the practical components need to be proven and I'm trying to generate as much information as I can to get the tick off.

2. On the topic of cpu's, I know intel is held as the gold standard, but I know AMD's newest chips have had decent performance and are cheaper. Would I be able to get away with an AMD chip if I'm running Abaqus simulations frequently? 
3. Would a build for this setup be possible in a small form factor? (i.e. min-itx case)
4. Should I look into engineering specific graphic cards like the Nvidia quadro line if I'm going to be gaming? Is a quadro all that necessary?

76,How to get EIT from Ohio board if I passed FE from Virginia state board?,1597860723,"Quick background: 

I am an international student who did my 4 year Mechanical Engineering undergrad in India and now about to complete my Master's from Ohio.

Initially plan was to give my FE exam from Ohio board. But since I would need to submit my undergrad transcripts to Ohio board before exam, had to drop that plan because COVID-19 lock-down in India. I registered through Virginia Board (which doesn't require you to submit transcripts before exam).

I passed my Exam today and got notice to submit application for EIT from Virginia Board. 

Here's Question: Should I apply to Virginia Board for EIT and then have it transferred to Ohio board? or have my score transfer to Ohio board and Apply EIT through it?

If I transfer score to Ohio, What would be process to apply for EIT?

85,Is it normal (and ok) to be the only engineer in your department?,1597852295,"The key in this whole story is that I have experience in this work, but I have only 2 years of engineering experience after college. I was hired as a temp for a NASA subcontractor. I had done some structural analysis reports before on the Orion life support system at my old job on a team of 3 after the FEA results were handed to us. My job right now is to run the models on a different system and write the reports. 

My issue is that I’m the only structures engineer in this whole office. I have no one to turn to to ask questions.

Here’s my situation:  I replaced a PhD who was contracted to do these analyses. He set up these models (thank god for that) and ran them and got all the results to put in the reports. My job was supposed to be to work in any action items sent back to us by Lockheed. Suddenly Lockheed needed new analyses run on these models so I have to redo the numbers. And I cannot reproduce the guy’s results. I think he was taking elemental stresses as a convenient way to lower his peak stresses, because the real nodal stresses are 3x higher than the elemental stresses, and I’m very afraid to allow that to go into the report because it sounds pretty illegitimate. I’ve emailed him about 3 different times on this issue and he can’t give me a straight answer for how he got his stresses.

Anyway, I’m hacking away at this model in FEMAP with NASTRAN (which is the most difficult computer program I have ever touched) every day to try to get it to pass. It’s so stressful that I’m going to start taking my laptop home to work on it and study this program on the weekends. I’m very afraid I’m going to lose my job if I can’t figure this thing out.

I'm building a new countertop/bar area and we're going for a more modern/industrial vibe. I'm trying to figure out how much my design will cost in materials (I'm going to weld/fab it up myself). 

[I've sketchedup my plans](https://i.postimg.cc/byWV9tr3/Overview.png) with the assumption that I'll probably need 3/8"" thick (0.375"") plate to serve as the bar top. But then it occured to me--could I get away with thinner plate? It would significantly reduce my cost, and also be easier to construct. I initially assumed 3/8"" was needed because I didn't want it to flex when I leaned on it (I'd prefer plates/cups not be sliding off the top when I push down on it to cut a piece of chicken, or lean on it to rest my weary soul). 

A few hours (!) of googling has shown me I don't even begin to have the understanding of how to figure this out.

I'm imagining that anything more than a few millimeters is probably too much flex--so if I have to go with 3/8"" thick plate, so be it. But if I can get minimal flex from 1/4"" plate, so much the better.

9,"Just had a discussion with my company's President on Career Progression, Disappointed in how it went. What Next?",1597813532,"I am just about reaching 3 years of experience at the company I interned with while in college and then got brought on full time after graduating. I hold an Electrical Engineering degree, but work as a System Test Engineer in my current role. I started at around the average starting salary for an EE, maybe a little bit lower. 

Currently, I like to think that I have been performing well in my role. I thoroughly enjoy my job, and have a genuine passion for the work. I have gotten regular merit based raises as part of my yearly performance review, with the highest one being a 5% increase after my first year on the job, and the successive ones being between 2-3%. My manager has provided me with strong performance reviews each year. Additionally, I've taken on several additional projects that have me working longer hours and have frequently traveled to manufacturing sites for weeks and weeks at a time in place of others who did not want to travel to that degree. Many of my projects directly feed into upper management, so all the managers and directors are very aware of my contributions, and at this point, I feel as if I am taking on a few more responsibilities than described in my job description when I got the offer. These projects have earned me frequent praise from not only my manager, but my manager's boss, and his boss, all the way up to top leadership from even our parent company. I've received several emails on my performance from several of our parent company's VPs praising my performance, especially over the last year or so. Yesterday, after completing an important project, I received a call from my company's President, thanking me for working the extra hours, making his life easier, and frequently going out of my way to push the business forward. He offered me a meeting to discuss career progression and goals. 

In the meeting, I entered with hopes of discussing promotion or at least some form of career progression, due to me having been in my role for 3 years and starting to feel stagnant. I told him about my plans to further my education (MBA plans) and asked him about progression in the company. He said our company is rather flat, and that I shouldn’t really think too much of a title, as he thinks of it as a just a label. He said to focus more on my responsibilities, and what those responsibilities add to the business. He also mentioned he plans to give me additional responsibilities, but it didn’t sound like it would be a promotion or anything like that, if anything likely more work, and I doubt it would include a significant pay bump. He ended with there is barely anything for me to improve upon, and him and all of the directors are very pleased with my work. 

I came away from this discussion slightly disappointed. I’ve been trying my hardest to go the extra mile at this job, and while I have been getting standard yearly increases, I thought I could be rewarded with something more significant. Additionally, with job hopping so common among early career professionals, I don’t want to feel as if I am leaving a higher salary on the table. If I am bringing value to the business like my managers have said, I would like to be compensated accordingly. Lastly, the company has still been hiring new engineers throughout the pandemic, so it’s not like we’re in a freeze right now or anything like that. I'd be fine with waiting until things get better economically as well. 

Am I wrong or being unreasonable in expecting/looking for a promotion based off the words of my managers/direcotrs and my accomplishments?

I am looking to buy my first home and the below report from a structural engineer was included in the sellers disclosure.

I can provide pictures of the cracks mentioned too if that helps.

Structural Inspection of Residence at
Description and Scope of Work
The residence is a one story wood-framed structure over a slab-on-grade, with an addition on the rear of the house, also slab-on-grade. The construction is described as follows:
The perimeter foundation is constructed with poured concrete trench footings. There is a concrete masonry block wall above the concrete as the property slopes down toward the rear.
The floor is assumed to be a floating concrete slab on soil, independent of the perimeter footings.
The exterior is primarily lap siding, with a half-wall brick front.
The front of the house faces west.
The property slopes down from west to east, with a small stream in the rear.
The scope of this report is to provide an assessment of the structural integrity of the foundation. This inspection was primarily visual, with supporting measurements by laser.
Summary of Defects Found
• The floor of the rear addition is sloping down toward the rear (east) wall by approximately 2”.
• The ceiling over the rear addition is sloping down toward the rear (east) wall by approximately
2”, measured along the north wall. The ceiling is also sloping down toward the southeast
corner by approximately 1-3/4”, measured along the east wall.
• There are shear cracks in the walls in the original house, in the hallway and bathroom. The
cracks are in the upper parts of the walls.
Diagnosis of Defects
There is evidence of past settling of the perimeter foundation under the three walls of the addition, as indicated by the defects described above. Separately, the floor slab under the addition has also settled, as indicated by the floor slope toward the east wall. The probable cause of the settling of slab and foundation is changes to the soil composition and volume due to changes in moisture. With the slope of the property, water can easily flow to the east side and erode soil under footings and slabs. Another factor for residences is the rotting of old tree roots from the trees that were likely cut to clear for constructing the residence. It takes many years for the process to complete, where roots decay and cause soil voids to occur. Lastly, water can accumulate near the house due to poorly functioning gutters and downspouts and poor grade conditions.
The movement of the addition has caused the cracks to occur in the walls of the main house, where the two are connected. Based on your description of the cracks, it is more likely the conditions have stabilized. In addition, there is no visual evidence of movement within the exterior of the house. Such evidence would be indicated by shear cracks in the block wall above the concrete footing, and separation of the north and south walls of the addition from the main house. There would also be cracking of mortar joints in the fireplace brick.
The existing conditions do not pose any immediate risk to the structural integrity of the residence, or to the safety of occupancy. Structural repairs are not absolutely necessary at this time, as I suggest a longer period of observation to determine stability of the foundation and slab. However, listed below are suggestions for future improvements, which can also be considered presently as a means of preventative maintenance.
The risk of further movement can be typically reduced by regularly maintaining the exterior grounds to prevent water from flowing toward the house. The most common forms of maintenance include:
• Keeping gutters and downspouts clear and free-flowing
• Extending downspouts a minimum 6’ from the house, or discharging to an underground
system
• Maintaining positive grade around the perimeter.
Suggestions for Repair/Improvement
1. To assist with observing the future movements, I suggest having the drywall professionally repaired in the hallway and bathroom. Should these defects reappear, this would indicate ongoing movement. Should this be the case, additional evaluation may be needed, or consider the repair in #2 below.
2. The perimeter foundation under the addition can be stabilized by installing helical piers, which are drilled to a depth of solid bearing strata. The footings will bear on the piers by use of a steel bracket. For this foundation I propose two (4) piers under the east wall, and four (4) piers each under the north and south walls.
There are three methods for repairing a settled/broken concrete slab on the interior of the house. All of the slab repair options require removal of the finished floor and subfloor (if any).
3. Complete replacement of the slab is the most effective repair. This requires removal of the finished flooring and existing concrete. The soil must then be properly compacted and leveled. The concrete floor should be a minimum 3-1/2” thick, with 6x6 wire mesh for reinforcement, or #3 or #4 rebar spaced at 12” intervals each way. This reinforcement can prevent future settling and cracking of the slab. This would likely be the most expensive option.
4. The slab can be leveled by a lifting process*, with expandable foam injected below the concrete. This repair is common, but there is some risk that the soil is still unstable below the floor, which can cause settling to reoccur in the future. Therefore, this repair process is more risky and may provide only short term beneficial results.
5. The final method is to remove the finished floor and subfloor and pour a self-leveling concrete compound over the existing slab.",AskEngineers,False,PebblyLizard23,/r/AskEngineers/comments/icfwdb/structural_inspection_translation_to_nonengineer/

I'm not sure specifically what I want to specialize in, but I really like propulsion and/or systems engineering. I'm looking for some early career advice.

I'm very lucky to have several options after I graduate, through a scholarship program. The program has paid for my undergraduate degree (in return for employment after college) and can also pay for graduate education. At the moment, I have two options. 

1. Begin working after UGrad \~3 years  to work off my scholarship commitment, and then pursue a graduate degree.
2. Immediately begin graduate school after finishing UGrad at either my current or another university, which will incur more years of work to repay in return as soon as that's completed.

The work that the scholarship requires is in aerospace/defense, and is very fulfilling. I've worked two internships with them already and I've love it, and I'm excited to begin working there full-time. At the moment I have a commitment of 3 years, but considering the work and the people, I could see myself being there much longer. As I mentioned, I feel incredibly lucky that this program has accepted me.

I'm wondering if it is important to get my graduate degree immediately considering that it's an option? I absolutely want to go back to graduate school at some point, but at the moment my options seem to be flexible. I can get it now and then start working, or work a few years and then go back.

I've gotten mixed answers so far, and I think that my biggest worry is being able to go back to the student regimen after working a few years. I've also worked hard in UGrad, so I don't think being accepted to at least somewhere would be an issue. 

Do I lose traction if I try to resume school after working a few years, or does it even matter? Or, is there anything else I'm not considering?

I am now considering going back to school to get my master's in mechanical engineering and am wondering what people's general take is on this shift.

I have developed a number of products where I had to fill multiple roles (industrial design, mechanical, and electrical engineering, firmware, fabrication, assembly, QA), both through internal projects and contracts. Regardless of my applied experience, I am concerned about some of the math and other technical/foundational elements that I will need to catch up on that other engineers have already covered in their undergrad programs.

Resistance is 1.015 ohms/ foot.  I figured I wanted a temperature of 1000 F (random guess on my part).  According to [this calculator](https://www.easycalculation.com/engineering/electrical/nichrome-wire-calculator.php) I need about 5.4 amps to get 1000 F.

5.4 amps at 120 volts gives a resistance of 22.22 ohms, which gives a length of 21.9 feet.

For ease of construction I ended up with about 23 feet of wire.

I hooked it up directly to power from the outlet, and was very unimpressed.  I could feel a little heat coming off.  But the wire certainly wasn't hot enough to start glowing.

I tried hooking up the power on a shorter length of wire.  When I hooked power across about 13 feet of wire it glowed the way I expected and gave off a good amount of heat.

So what is my mistake?  Why didn't it work the way I expected?  I have 3 theories:

1.  I have absolutely no clue about anything.  I fundamentally don't understand what I am doing.

2.  The heater worked exactly as designed and I have a faulty impression of what a 1000 F wire should look like, and the kind of heat it should throw.

I turned down a dream internship offer which would have opened a door within the data science field for me, mostly because of where it was located, and the one I went to turned sour because the whole industry (aeronautics) got badly impacted by the pandemic.
At the same time, I've missed the opportunity of doing a PhD in machine learning because I hesitated for too long about going for it. 

Honestly I don't even know how to feel anymore, Covid makes me worry about my first job, even if I know I'm not the only one with this problem.

57,Can I make a PC fan controller for less than a dollar?,1597758857,"Hi engineers,

I love this sub, and I trust you'll tell me if I'm accidently spamming it up with my naive questions.

I'm hoping to plug more fans into my mainboard than it's rated for, which I know will run the risk of damaging it, so I want to make a device to use the power supply's own 12v rail, but maintain the control given by the mainboard.

The device I want to make will do the same function as these:

 [https://www.overclockers.co.uk/air-cooling/fans/fan-controllers](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/air-cooling/fans/fan-controllers) 

But I think I can make it for only a few dollars using a ""digipot"", after five minutes of googling. 

My mainboard wants to output +0v to +12v depending on it's internal logic, with a maximum draw of 1A, but I ideally want to use less than half of its maximum current. The mainboard also has a signal input, which is expecting an pulsed signal from one of the fans.

My power supply outputs +12v and gnd on one of its Sata cables, with a current rating waaaay above what I'm going to use with fans. 

So my plan is to aquire a digipot, then use the mainboard's power and ground cables as inputs for the digital potentiometer, and on the other side of it, connect the sata cable's 12v and gnd cables, and hopefully get an output cable that's the same variable voltage as the mainboard's pin, but with the much larger current capactity of the power supply's SATA cable. Between all the fans I ever intend to use, I might use about 2.5A.

This is my plan. But it comes a bit unstuck when it comes to choosing a component for the digital potentiometer. There are lots of numerical constraints here, and I don't know which ones are critical to component choice and which are not.

So my questions are twofold. How should I approach the task of choosing which Digital Potentiometer to buy, and is my plan sound in general terms?

As ever, I look forward to hearing your views.

78,How to make friends at work?,1597714800,"This is probably a strange question to ask here but I really need help. Any help/advise would be greatly appreciated.

A little background of myself: new grad started working as a manufacturing engineer about a couple months ago at a *new* city; introverted; not the best at starting conversation with new people.

Unlike many other new grads, I'm fortunate enough to be able to work in person instead of working from home. Even though I am working in person, I'm still struggling to make friends and connect with my coworkers.

Right now, only about 1/10 (?) of people at my company is working on site (those who are working on production floor) and of those people, there is a decent number of young engineers with under 5 years of experiences. The only time I talk with any people at work is for work related. I couldn't make any casual conversation with anyone as of right now.

I am the type to join in other people conversation or topic instead of starting the conversation myself. College had a lot of opportunities where I can do that so I didn't have problems with making friends then. But at work, I feel like there are less of those kind of opportunities where I can have conversations with a group of coworkers and covid isn't helping either. 

I can't eat lunch together with my coworkers while having conversation because all the tables are 6 feet apart. And the company usually has a lot of events for the employees to participate and just spend time together (especially in the summer) but those are also gone because of covid. Our desks of those who are working on site are also pretty spread out on the production floor so I can't really have small talk over while at desk.. 

So, unless I walk up to someone's cube and start the conversation (which I am really, really not good at and I don't know how), I don't know how else I could approach this problem. I don't think I even know people enough to know what and how I should start the conversation, you know? 

What should I do to become closer to my coworkers? What kind of things I can talk about during those short time when I pass by people rather than just ""*Hi. How are you? Good. You? Great. See you later. Bye*"" If I were to walk up to people's cubes, how do I start the conversation without sounding super weird? Should I send IM's via work Skype? Would it be very weird?

82,Engine RPM limiting coil defeat,1597710630," 

Hello I just created this account to ask this question, I have a very application specific question surrounding I believe electrical engineering and micro controllers.

First the application: This is a small engine that is magneto spark with a coil that limits the RPM of the engine to 6000 RPM. This works flawlessly unless the system is tampered with, if for example I bring the gap of the spark plug to very narrow, say .005"" the RPM limiter does not activate. The coil and rev limiting controller/chip are encased in potting material and no accessible to pin out.

My theory of operation: Analog input from the flywheel triggers the firing event, controller then tells the coil to fire. It is able to recognize a firing event by the Vout of the coil heading to the spark plug. When the plug gap is so small it is below it's RPM Voltage counting, therefore it's sending spark but not able to read anything it's sent, unlocking the RPM limiter.

Further question: If my theory of operation is correct, the controller is using the engine as a ground and reference voltage. Is it possible I could energize the engine/reference voltage to achieve the same effect without having to lower the spark plug gap?",AskEngineers,False,Neither-Value-6846,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ibql26/engine_rpm_limiting_coil_defeat/

The degree has modules in orbital mechanics ([link here](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?check_params=1&amp;aa=2020&amp;k_corso_la=470&amp;lang=EN&amp;polij_device_category=DESKTOP&amp;__pj0=0&amp;__pj1=14d6f790fa4cf38bf42248a5e5f871d5), I couldn't post a picture), spacecraft design, management of space systems and so on. 

My question is, what kind of career does this lead to? I was always under the impression that the physicists would handle the orbital mechanics, the aerospace engineers would handle design of the spacecraft, mechanical/aerospace would design the propulsion systems, etc, not some weird amalgamation of each field that only touched upon each subject?",AskEngineers,False,A_Random_Platypus,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ibpavj/what_kind_of_career_does_a_degree_in_space/

I’m working as an intern at a company this summer and have given an offer to start may of next year (when I graduate) The response deadline is at the end of the month (08/31). However I wanted to go to my schools career fair and see other options. How should I request an extension so I can go to the career fair?

93,Did/does your electrical company have a database of utility poles and their statuses?,1597700770,"How do electrical companies keep track of outages, downed poles, and etc? I would assume they have a database of all of the utility poles within their jurisdiction and have some sort of system that alerts them of any power outages?

Or is it all dependent on customers? I.e, customers have to call in an outage, otherwise the power company would have no idea?

I ask for a very specific reason. I'm planning on creating a service, and I need to know how/if utility poles are kept track of.",AskEngineers,False,gman1cus,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ibnp6n/diddoes_your_electrical_company_have_a_database/
94,I want to make a new computer OS with hardware and the OS from the same company only. What background do you recommend? What advice do you have?,1597700738,"Since high school, I dreamed about making a new computer OS. The Motorola Atrix serves as inspiration. As I learned more about computers, my desire grew stronger. I have ideas on what to do differently. I researched phone makers that serve developing regions like those in Africa and parts of Asia. I compared and contrasted them with the low cost smartphones in the United States.

The problem is that I originally signed up to do pre-engineering courses for college. I had low self discipline to where I changed to BBA in Management. I learned good stuff but wish I would have improved my self discipline and sought help for conditions I had sooner. I graduated with Management. I read *Burn the Business Plan*. It's a counterintuitive book on what better entrepreneurs do.

The smartphone with my OS can function in standalone mode or can be connected to a human interface device like a laptop dock. With the latter, the phone is like the brain while the human interface device is like body parts interacting with the brain. I'd like to serve the a market that's budget conscious like developing markets. Designing with a concise product lineup will be a given. With an advanced variant of the OS, a central device on a local area network (library for example) can have the user's computing device control the central device. The central device can make collaboration in the same building or remotely by uploading and syncing to the cloud (remote 3rd party servers) as needed. It'll be useful for video editing projects, photo editing, rendering, and more. Advanced users can take apps they have and deploy them on the central device in the building or room. I'll use the Zircon kernel and the ARM64 ISA.

What advice do you have about how to get the proper knowledge and working together to build the OS? How do you recommend I go about networking with the correct people the correct way? I will get a career at an innovative company before starting my own. This is for experience purposes. What's your general advice?

95,What should an Entry level Engineer with a bachelors in ME be paid?,1597699529,"First I would like to state that this is not one of those “I want to be an engineer because they get paid good” scenario’s. I am 3/4s done with my degree and have not found an area of study that is more fascinating to me (I had to say this because I’ve had too many people tell me “don’t choose your major because of the pay grade” (obviously) and other things when you even remotely mention pay). Now that that’s out of the way what should an entry level mechanical engineer be paid? Obviously this will vary depending on location, industry and a lot of other factors but from what I’ve researched 55-65k is about the average to start. What do you guys think is a good starting pay? What do you think would be a lowball offer? Whats the least you personally would accept? (assuming you have multiple offers😂) Factors that would increase or decrease your starting salary? (You could include value of benefits and compare to pay here if you like) 

Also any tips on landing that first job in a good place? good companies to start at or ones to stay away from? or any general tip for an entry level engineer would be much appreciated",AskEngineers,False,Lizzos_toenail,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ibnb34/what_should_an_entry_level_engineer_with_a/
