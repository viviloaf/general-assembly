5,I'm constructing air conditioning chamber. What materials could be used for the chamber's body? (pictures inside),1456360277,"Current concept looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/c9tkHAT.png).

[Dimensions](http://i.imgur.com/aSmg6bz.png) for scale (in milimeters).

The purpose of this chamber is to prepare air that will go to another chamber, where precise measurements are being performed.
Cross section of the toroidal chamber is not less than 200x300 mm (~8x13 inches), and internal components must be easily accessible (to refill water in humidifier for example). Commercial air ducts made of plastic or steel were too small, not rigid enough and not openable. I thought about using Bosch-Rexroth profiles with walls made of plexi or glass, but if I wanted rounded corners for smoother air flow it would be hard if not impossible to do. Another thing worth mentioning is that it doesn't have to be super air-tight, because I will try to make pressure inside slightly higher than outside (the other chamber isn't totally air-tight). 

What I'd like to know is what other engineers use for purposes like this or what can be realistically used. This is my 1st time constructing something related to air conditioning, so I may lack some really basic knowledge. 

Some explanation about what visible components on the concept are:

* big whitey thing is Peltier device for temperature control
* big black thing in the back is Peltier dehumidifier
* small thing in green box is ultrasonic fogger for increasing humidity
* Red arrow symbolizes the direction of air flow inside the chamber",AskEngineers,mcaay,/r/AskEngineers/comments/47g5vh/im_constructing_air_conditioning_chamber_what/

7,"Where English skills are concerned, what do engineers need to be able to do for success in their fields?",1456355313,"Before you dismiss this as a stupid question, read on.

I'm an English teacher of the Deaf in the high school department (we serve K-12 plus post-graduates, up to the age of 22), and I have a certain student who is currently a sophomore.  He aims to become an engineer, something focused in the computer field, I think.  Anyway,  we have had an ongoing ""discussion"" that if I'm not careful, will devolve into a full-out argument over whether or not English is necessary for his future goals.

Here's the thing.  He's an excellent reader and writer, but does not think that anything beyond those skills are necessary.  One particular point I remember.  He said ""I don't need to know Shakespeare in life or for work!""  To which I responded (admittedly losing my cool) ""It's not Shakespeare you need to know, it's the skills that go with it - the skills of analyzing what you read, the skills of debate, etc.""

So, engineers of reddit, what specific English skills beyond reading and writing are necessary to be successful as engineers?  What parts of the job is not enjoyable but must be done as part of the job?  Deadlines, etc.

20,Profile tolerance question [Mechanical],1456331565,"I have a feature that is an arc with a basic radius.  Feature is about as wide as your hand and looks kind of like a smiley face (so much less than 90 degrees).  The application is closer to optics where the curvature, absolute position and waviness of the surface matter more than fit or balance.

 - I want the supplier to touch multiple points on the arc and calculate the radius relative to the ideal center point of the arc.
 - I want to allow for a relatively large range for the actual radius value.  Ie something like r100 +/-1.  That seems like a clear case for true position relative to datums
 - I want to have a much tighter requirement saying that the radius needs to be consistent.  So if you take a dozen points on the curve, the radius can not vary more than 0.15mm.  So if the measured values ranged from 99.1 to 99.2 (ie tight variation but mean is far from target) the part would pass but if it ranged from 99.8 to to 100.2 (ie wide variation but right on the target) the part would fail.

How would I do this?  None of the GDT options seem to quite fit:

 - Profile without any datums- This is probably closest but not quite what I want.  It would allow the radius center to shift but the shape would need to be right.  I think with trig it would probably be relatively close but I'm afraid this would confuse the supplier during inspection

 - Circularity/ cylendricity- this also seems close because the boundary zone looks right.  but Since its not a full radius, i don't know if you could calculate this. 

 - Runnout- once again, it doesn't really make sense given that this isn't a full arc.  I haven't used runout that much so maybe i'm thinking about it wrong.

 - Just make a note explaining what I want-  this is kind of my last resort but I may end up doing this just to make sure the supplier understands.",AskEngineers,hamfast42,/r/AskEngineers/comments/47dfdx/profile_tolerance_question_mechanical/

23,Help with control system of a wind turbine,1456327989,"Hello one and all!

Basically my EEE project is to model a wind turbine and its generator and produce a PID controller, with the wind-tip-speed ratio (lambda) and blade pitch(beta) as my 2 inputs.

My defining equation is:
J.dw/dt = Te - Tm 
where J=inertia, w=angular speed, Te is the electrical torque ie the torque being generated by the turbine, and Tm is the mechanical opposing torque produced by the generator. 

Te is = Pv.Cq where Pv=wind power and Cq is torque coefficient=Cp/lambda where Cp is power coefficient, a non linear function which I have linearised. Cq is a function of lambda and beta.  

Tm is, according to my tutor = c.w^2 where c is a generator constant called 'drag torque to speed constant'. My tutor says -&gt;'If you want to simplify this to be Tm=c*w, it has to be for small region of the rotational speed. I would prefer to keep it in quadratic term and linearize later around certain speed.' 

After I linearise Cq my eqn becomes: 
J.dw/dt = a.lambda + b.Beta - c.w^2.

So my actual question(s) are 1) can any one shred any light on the  'drag torque speed constant' as I am really struggling to find info on it? 

and 2) how can I produce the transfer function with the w^2 term.
How do I Laplace transform w^2 to get just a w(s) term so that I can have my transfer function's G1= w(s)/lambda(s) and G2=w(s)/beta(s)?

I'm leaning towards nickel plated at the moment.  Is that a good decision?  Google seems to be suggesting that nickel plating is suitable for temporary moisture exposure, but not long term moisture exposure.  That doesn't sound good.  Would grey plating be a better option?

There are other options like ""zinc"", and ""zinc alloy"".  Should I go up the chain, so to speak, and look at options like zinc plating?

36,Optimizing a Propeller for cruise and climb,1456300386,"How does propeller geometry depend on mission i.e. portion of the flight in climb, portion in cruise. I understand variable pitch props and how they optimize efficiency over a range of advance ratio's. I am wondering if there are other considerations.

So for the a400m for example, efficient cruise is important as well as STOL capability. Aside from variable pitch blade's how is an optimal geometry determined. What are the crucial variable's? 

I know the integrated lift coefficient can be optimized. So high camber is good for take off, low camber good for cruise some where between there is goldielocks.Thickness is mostly constrained by high speed flight same as propeller sweep.  Cord is determined by power output? I am a bit lost to be honest.

It would be even better to do it with a reusable and refillable safe system which could be easily controlled and manipulated but it doesn't seem to exist. You know, something like the JetCat air-breathing reaction engines (http://www.jetcatusa.com/) but with small anaerobic rocket reaction engines (usable for a 20-30 seconds and generating 20-30 Newtons). One could play around as a versatile propulsion system (cfr. video) or work (DIY/makers, education, ...) with it.

* Why do you think it isn't available? 
* Is it too complex, too expensive, too dangerous? 
* Even with a safe design (no explosion risk), could a human stay next to such device (generated noise, generated gas temperature &amp; speed, etc) 
* Is it because there is no market? 
* If such device was existing, what range of power would you find sexy and what price would you be ready to pay for it? As I said I would go for a small engine (20-30N) that I could put on my bike and would be ready to pay 800$-1000$ for it.

I'm currently in my final masters year of study in mechanical engineering and we have a engineering in society module which prepares us for all the responsibilities and ethical decisions we will face in the future. As a topic to study I have chosen Autonomous cars and I have a very short survey raising some questions based around the content of my dissertation.
I am after around 8 engineers to give some feedback, it wont take very long and it would be doing me a huge favour. I also think that the questions and topics raised will provide some interesting ideas for you ponder over :)

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**

### Timeframe

This post will be stickied until ~20 top-level responses have been collected, or after 2 weeks — whichever comes first. The next engineering discipline will then be posted and stickied, and old threads will remain open to responses until archived by reddit (6 months after posting).

Our deflection test is a beam supported by two points, loaded downward in the center by a jack, with the deflection measured at three points using indicators. Our current indicators are not digital, so we just take readouts at set points in the test, which leads to a fairly chunky curve.

80,Are these OSHA violations?,1456152189,"So, long story short is I'm debating blowing the whistle on my employer. However, before I do this, I want to make certain I am correct before I pull the trigger. So I have a few questions to clarify to make sure these are actual OSHA violations.  

1. They're pretty good about locking out motors and other mechanical devices. However, they don't require people to lock out valves blocking pressurized pipe lines. 

E.g. if lets say they had to clean a heat exchanger. They would lock out pump A and close a valve on the cold side, but they can't turn off the hot side pump B, so they close a valve isolating the exchanger from pump B, but they do not lock the valve out on either pump A or B. The medium in pump B is water at about 140-160 F. All valves are easily accessed. 

2. Does it matter what the medium in the pipe is, or just so long as it is pressurized?

This type of stuff happens routinely.  

3. They have agitators with exposed rotating shafts, at waist level from the ground.  This was reported previously to management, but they stated that there wasn't a pinch point so its ok. However, one could easily grasp the rotating shaft with their hands. 

4. They have unguarded rotating gears that are not 7 feet off the ground. This has been reported previously too, but nothing was ever done. 

Also, what are the potential repercussions of being an OSHA whistle blower? I.e. what negative things can happen to me?

85,12V vs 24V Electric Motor (Winch) Selection,1456138054,"Hi guys,

Currently looking into the possibility of using an 4WD specced electric based winch to use as a wakeboarding winch. I understand that a gasoline powered winch would be easier - but doing things the easy way isn't what we are in this subreddit for now is it.

My background is in civil engineering so whilst I have a grip on the mechanics of the project I am teaching myself the electricity side as I go here, and would like a bit of advice on selecting the right motor. Various ebay resellers have high load electric motors, many in 12V and 24V variants- however on their spec sheets they are indicating they pull identical Amps. My understanding is that for the same powered engine (5kW e.g.) a 12V power source will req. twice the amperage out of a power source? We are planning on running the setup on a smal bank of car batteries either in series or parrallell depending on voltage needed so would the 24V variant be better suited to my application?
Here are the spec sheets of the two motors; http://imgur.com/a/Cf0ZW.

86,"Rotary relationship between two wheels in contact (gears, geometry) [X-Post /r/askmath]",1456133170,"Hello, I'm working on a project where a small wheel (size not confirmed) attached to a rotary encoder will roll around the edge of a large wheel (52cm diameter).    
I'm looking to find, ideally a formula, which will let me work out that if there is x degrees of movement in WheelL, how many degrees will WheelS rotate?    
They are arranged so that the two wheels are in contact, much like gears would be. Gear formula seem to be focussed on number of teeth, but in a wheel-in-contact scenario it would effectively be two different size gears with infinite number of sprockets each.    
    
To set the scene, the base of a dobsonian telescope has two base plates. One remains still, the other rotates. Attach a rotary encoder with a wheel to one, and as the other rotates it will rotate the wheel attached to the encoder, which can then give a degree reading. The reason for wanting to do this as a ""geared"" system is because it will allow the use of a much less accurate (and thus cheaper) encoder, compared to reading off the baseplate center bolt itself.    
    
Essentially, If WheelL (diameter 52cm) rotates Y degrees, how many degrees will WheelS of diameter X rotate?

0,[Mechanical] Need help figuring the best structure for a standing desk foot.,1456022217,"Hello engineers,

I'm currently trying to build a standing desk for myself and a couple of friends. I know that in the USA &amp; Europe there are fairly numerous options to choose from, but in Brazil we have none. 

After some research I managed to get a hold on some Linak's DL7 Lifting Columns. They have a reseller here in Brazil. Linak seems to be the top standard for lifting columns (providing to some of the major builders).

The issue I've stumbled upon with is that Linak doesn't provide the feet or stabilizing bar for the columns. I have to build them myself. And this is where I turn into a moron. I have zero background in engineering/materials and next to zero in modeling. But I've decided to do this and here I am.

I've managed to build a [SketchUp Model](http://i.imgur.com/yKW8ndO.png) of the proposed design for the tabletop and desk structure. But I have some questions about my solution for the foot.

-- 

From a design/ergonomic stand point I need it (the base that connects and holds the columns) to be the shortest possible. I've chosen a 1/2"" inch steel plate cut to 600x100mm. The columns are fixed to them by 2 M8 screws. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/CuLr1ri.png) are the columns drawings.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/H85BZCQ.png). [And here](http://i.imgur.com/pDPEEFz.png).

These columns/desk have and adjustable height ranging from approximately 720mm to 1150mm (with the current design).

Will these plates provide enough support and not bend with the tables load? I'd say a max of 50-100Kgf load.

Should I do something different?

1,How to design a Boat Takeout System,1456020963,"#Boat Takeout  
Hey guys,  

So as part of an engineering senior design project, I'm on a team tasked with the design of a boat *takeout* system.  

The takeout needs to:

+ allow boats to be removed from the water and put onto a trailer 
- but not allow boats to be launched.   

Does this type of a system exist?   

#Concepts  
My team and I came up with [5 concepts](http://imgur.com/a/xXcgf) and have narrowed it to the following three.   
The site is located on a river where the water is brackish (not fresh water) and silty (abrasive) and depth is subject to change with the tides.

1. [**Concept One**](http://imgur.com/OjE3W15), the simplest, currently calls for rubber mats, but I'm trying to find a better material.
 - Perhaps long stiff nylon bristle material similar to a [deck brush](http://i.imgur.com/rUfQXA8.png?1) would work?
 - Or [plastic mats](http://i.imgur.com/LJEUPe6.png?1)? 

 &amp;nbsp;
	
4. [**Concept Four**](http://imgur.com/C16kewi) utilizes a a pawl and ratchet mechanism activated by the weight of the boat on a sliding cart deck. A gear attached to the axle has been proposed as a more elegant solution to the external track shown.  Two questions:  
 - How to return and keep the cart at the water line, a constantly changing location?
 - Special hub/bearing design to withstand constant immersion in salty/silty water?  

 &amp;nbsp;

9. [**Concept Five**](http://imgur.com/pWwT6Vo) started with the team looking at utilizing a conveyor system (belt or chain driven), however couldn’t find anything existing that would work for this environment.  

 We settled for a series of bearingless rollers using rotating PVC pipe. Launch prevention through the use of the one-way, self-closing gates and retrieval using an electric winch.

3,What do you think about techs/non-engineers calling themselves engineers?,1455998482,"In my country, the title 'engineer' is protected by law.  To be an engineer, you must take a 4 year bachelors of applied science degree, which only a few Universities offer, in your respective field (i.e. mech, civil, electrical, chemcial, etc), work under another engineer for 3 years, and then pass a really long exam.  So, to become an engineer, it takes around 7-8 years.  But to get into engineering school, you essentially have to be the top of your class in high school.

However, I've seen a lot of people who aren't engineers (such as technicians) call themselves engineers.  I.e., one of my cousins has a 2 year associates degree from a college and he calls himself a civil engineer.

Engineers here essentially design things, using science and math, as well as following regulations, working in teams, and coming up with new solutions to difficult problems.  Technicians just build the schematics given to them by engineers.  (Also, you legally can't do any engineering job unless you're licensed with the government)

This really annoys me, because its a slap in the face to real engineers who have actually spent 10+ years of their life getting the qualifications (I'm including high school, because you have to take  extra hard special courses in high school if you want to get into engineering school, as well as have 95%+ average in these courses like calculus to vector calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, etc).  

Additionally, it makes engineers look lower/dumber than they are.  Someone who can solder a circuit board or connect wires on a protoboard based off of a schematic is not the same as an electrical engineer who actually designs complex systems and designs integrated circuits, for instance.

I'm clearly not a professional but I have a large insterest in genIV tech. As a first year student in chemical engineering I'm considering to get a masters in reactor technology. Personally I think nuclear is the future of energy production (which is not uncommon among STEM workers and students)

10,I love working with tech but office life is draining all my life energy and I feel like I still haven't found if that's what I want to do in life. What are my options?,1455961998,"I've graduated last June and have worked in a product development consultancy for six months now, doing mostly embedded software development. Now, while I do enjoy (to an extent) the intellectual challenge I am presented with, and finally having free weekends and all, there is several things about 9-5 life that absolutely drain my life energy and make me want to quit everything. I'm not expecting a magical solution to all my problems, I'm just trying to explore some of my options here. Also, apologies if this sounds a bit rant-like.

* Social - I get maybe an hour of casual interaction with humans during lunch break and eve that is with people who don't share any of my priorities and very few of my interest. Those interactions are meaningless and literally the only point to them is keeping myself roughly sane.

* Time - working time + commute + lunch break means that even though in theory my contract says 37h week, I leave home at 8:30am and am not back until at least 6.30pm. Most of the kind of people I like to spend time with are the exact opposite of that - they almost all work at very variable times - artists, PhD students, start-upers and the like. Having evenings and weekends free is pointless to me if I have nobody to share them with.

* Pay / Time - I make way more money that I am able to spend. Way more than I need (I really don't need much). Currently the main use of my pay is to fill a little pot of cash I'm planning to use to sustain myself when I eventually quit this madness. I'd much prefer being able to work 6-months on / 6-months off and take half pay but that doesn't seem to be how things work.

* 'Interestingness' - I love technology and I enjoy working with it, but I feel that in the office I become less of an interesting person. I want to be able to take time off to cycle across south america. I want to be able to go to that intentional community that formed in my time to see if maybe I enjoy farming. I want to be able to pursue personal projects without having to sacrifice all social life. I'm in my 20s for gods sake and isn't this the time when I'm supposed to be discovering myself? I only really realized how boring and 'undiscovered' I was (i.e. unsure what my passions actually are and if they even exist) in my senior year of college. There is a lot of discovering to do.

Now, in my mind there exists something for me to do that would solve at least some of my concerns. Freelancing. Creating some sort of tech-startup-cooperative-collective. Going into PhD. But to be honest I don't feel qualified to do any of those. It might be the case of me not realizing that in reality everyone is kinda winging it but oh well.

Amongst all of those demands am I concerned about the money? Not particularly. I know for sure I would be able to get by doing 2-3 hours of tutoring everyday (know some people who do that + that's how I maintained myself at university). Student loan isn't a problem either because of its conditions (don't have to pay it if I'm not making enough money). Why don't I just quit everything and do that then? Well, I feel like that would kind of being an asshole to my future self, should he decide to go back into professional office engineering. Something tells me there is nothing that ruins your employability as taking a couple years off to 'discover yourself'.

**tl;dr** I want to discover 'me' and live the life I want without ruining my employability in the tech industry. Not sure if that's reasonable / possible / sane",AskEngineers,Sanuuu,/r/AskEngineers/comments/46pijp/i_love_working_with_tech_but_office_life_is/

We do not have access to similar data for river flow. (Short of calling up the lockkeeper and asking on the phone)

We're hoping that by tracking the difference in these two levels, we may get an idea of river flow. If not an exact figure, then a feeling for whether the flow is increasing or decreasing would suffice.

The support frame will simply be supporting a static load (the weight of the object it's holding).  The object will be lifted slightly, moved horizontally away from the frame, and then placed back on the frame.  This is a repeated process.

As the subject subtlely hints at, I'm using a [200kg disc load cell](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13332) to make a big scale. The (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/load-cell-amplifier-hx711-breakout-hookup-guide?_ga=1.193287469.1450243672.1455733641)[Sparkfun Load Cell Hookup Guide] was very helpful, but unfortunately the one type of load cell it did not include a setup picture for was the disc load cell.

I'm hoping for a little mechanical guidance. Say I have a 4x4 sheet of plywood or thin metal and I bolt my little disc load cell, on top, to the center. And then I set another sheet on top. How do I balance the corners? How do I best make sure the load is distributed as evenly as possible even if I don't put my box or whatever right in the center of the scale? I thought I could winch down springs at each corner that would be pulling the top board down onto the load cell, then calibrate for that pre load. But it still seems like the entire assembly would be precariously loaded on a single point (probably because it would be) Can anyone think of a better way?

I'm a long time lurker of /rEngineering, /rAskEngineers, and /rEngineeringStudents. I've seen a lot of posts that ask ""should I quit my job and get a Masters???"", my question is on the opposite side. I'll keep it brief:

So I'm a little burnt about my situation in my masters degree program. Currently I'm involved in a combined BS/MS program with my university, and I'm finishing the last of the required classes for my masters degree. I've finished the undergrad portion of my degrees about a year ago. I'm currently taking one class and the rest of my time is dedicated to research and writing my thesis. The trouble is, the project that I'm working on was left in shambles by the guys that just defended their thesis and bailed. I'm left to fix the system so that I can perform my experiments and hopefully write about them. 

It seems that every other student that enters my lab is given some unique small project that is branched off of the bigger projects that are my lab's primary focus. They seem to be done in &lt;7months because a lot of the  research they do is modeling real systems with software. Being on the experimental side of the things, I have to deal with real parts that break or don't work, which doesn't lend itself well for thesis writing. I realize that this is a good prep for the reality of an engineering job, but I still feel like I'm getting a raw deal. I feel like I'm being used as a technician because a lot of these guys in my lab don't want to pick up a wrench. I've expressed this to my advisor but he is a master of talking me off the ledge without really solving any of my concerns.

I did the combined degree program to enhance my career prospects and to get a little focused knowledge in my branch of Mech. Eng., but I feel stressed out, unappreciated, and I'm not generating income for my future. I'm not getting that work experience that industry desires and I don't want to quit because I'm so close, but I don't know what to do.

45,What is the best way to strike with a 6 foot staff weapon (AKA Bo or Quarterstaff),1455814875,"I'm interested in figuring out the best place on the length of the staff to strike, when swinging a 6 foot staff. I've heard answers ranging from the tip (that portion is swinging the fastest so has the most kinetic energy?) to about 1/4 from the tip (do to leverages issues, and part of the impact being taken by the hand or hands used).

There generally are 6 different ways to hold a staff:

1.) with the hands dividing the staff into thirds, both palms facing the same direction.
2.) with the hands dividing the staff into thirds, palms facing the opposite directions.
3.) with one hand at end and the other a quarter to a third of the way down the staff, both palms facing the same direction.
4.) with one hand at end and the other a quarter to a third of the way down the staff, palms facing the opposite directions.
5.) with one hand within a few inches of the end, swinging the staff freely.
6.) with two hands at the end, like a bat.

It's been about 15 years since I last applied my engineering skills/physics skills to anything serious. I know that several things could be taken into account:
Force
Impact
Kinetic Energy
Impulse

Here's some basic assumptions:
1.) The staff is made of hard wood, not rattan or bamboo, and therefore effectively rigid (although some martial systems use flexible ""monkey sticks, which is an entirely different situation).
2.) Both feet are on the ground (ie, no jumping or falling from the 2nd floor)
3.) Swinging the staff in an arc, not poking with the tip.
4.) The staff has a uniform density throughout.
5?) I'm not even sure it matters what the length of the staff is... for example, a 4' Jo staff, a club, or an Escrima stick has, effectively the same 
issues involved.

Note: I'm asking here because I'm interested in the best part if the staff to strike with, NOT the best ""martial technique.""

46,"3-Phase wired up as Detla, VFD set-up as Star - what happened?",1455813707,"So we recently had a fault with one of our fan motors in the middle of the night.

As far as I can gather - one of the phases burnt out, caused electrical faults to stop the process.

Electrical maintainers attend, didn't inspect the fan in-situ, adjust the VFD settings in the MCC room and changed the settings from Delta to Star.

So what happens when a VFD tries to drive a Delta motor with one duff phase as a if it were a Star motor? 

It started, and ran for a few days until we replaced the motor and put everything back to normal..

50,"Calculation of magnetic force acting on a variety of materials in ambient environment (air, RTP)",1455807966,"No one seemed to reply, so I'm asking again, hopefully someone will point me in the right direction to begin with.

Elementary physics tells us a magnetic field induces one in all materials, most of which are diagmagnetic (weak, opposite response), paramagnetic (stronger, like response), and ferromagnetic (Way stronger, like response). It feels like I missed a class.

we're used to ferromagnetic materials just snapping to the magnet when brought into proximity. So one would assume there's a force acting on ferromagnetic materials when brought close to a magnet, probably following an inverse square law (As per most fields) - how does one calculate the force acting on the paperclip (or any other ferromagnetic material) when the 'strength' of the magnetic field is known, together with other charactersitics of the subject ferromagnetic material?

What about for paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials? I know that it's possible with a sufficiently strong magnetic field, to exert a significant force on diamagnetic materials as seen with that famous levitating frog experiment (did it survive?)
But how does one go about quantifying the magnetic force involved?

64,What were the advantages of rotary engines? (nb this doesn't mean Wankel),1455755896,"A rotary engine is one in which the crank-shaft remains still, while the engine rotates around it. Usually these were radial engines, although the original Wankel engine was a rotary (but *not* examples like the Mazda, where the engine remains still and the crank-shaft moves). They were mainly used on early aircraft. An example of a replica Oberursel UR-II engine is shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6xX0zSvp7w). 

It is quite easy to think of problems with the design - for instance there is a large rotating mass, which in some cases made the plane reluctant to turn in one direction and dangerously eager to turn in the other due to gyroscopic effects. Laying out the inlet ducts and ignition was difficult, only stub exhausts could be used, and lubrication of the pistons and bearings was normally total-loss, with no forced lubrication of the valve-gear.. However I can't think of any advantages - for instance although the engine would have been cooled by whirling through the air-stream, a non-rotating radial engine would have been sitting directly behind a propellor in any case.

I watch these out the window every day, and I'm confused about how an engineer or operator plans the erection - can the amount of counter-weight be increased during operation, or is it fixed for the life of the structure?  If they can add weight, how do they do it?  If they cannot add weight, does the counterweight trolley to adjust the center of balance?

I can't imagine that the crane has a very wide useful load if the balance of the structure couldn't be altered in some way, otherwise you'd always have to lift a relatively narrow range of loads to avoid overcoming your counterweight.  If you have a 50 foot jib, picking a 5 ton load at 10 feet of trolley requires a hell of a different balance argument than the same load at 50 feet, doesn't it?

Assuming you had enough setup time margin and the design allowed it, would an easy fix be to just change the edge of which one of the flops launches/captures?  You should never have a hold time violation between two flops that launch/capture on different edges as the data from the sending flop should have been captured definitely by the receiving clock, before the sending flop launches the next set of data.

89,How to Mesh correctly?,1455683556,"I'm currently working on meshing a Circulation Control (CC) wing using a structured mesh to capture the boundary layer using ANSYS' Icem. Due to the wing blending in to the aircraft body, I'm using an O-grid to mesh the wing. The wing is unusual in that it has blowing ports, or slots, long its leading and trailing edges. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/jrrQeda.png) is a cross-section of the wing and [here](http://i.imgur.com/gSL4ZK3.png) is a top down view. [This](http://i.imgur.com/tkme1oV.png) shows the actual trailing edge ports on the model's wing. Hopefully this gives enough context for my question.

Now, the problem is I don't know how to create a clean mesh next to the ports. [This](http://i.imgur.com/5lFmyYu.png) image and [this](http://i.imgur.com/xieTQ7a.png) image show what the mesh at the ports look like just using an O-grid. As you can see, there are a large number of skewed cells right at the port. (Please realize that the cell sizing and growth have not been correctly adjusted yet.) 

I'm completely stumped. I have tried splitting some of the O-grid blocks to better model the ports but it just leads to an even larger number of skewed cells else where along the chord. I appreciate any and all suggestions, even if it means completely starting the mesh over. Thanks!

Edit: Just to be clear, in the screenshots, B.L. stands for ""Boundary Layer"" and U_infinity is the free stream velocity vector.

we're used to ferromagnetic materials just snapping to the magnet when brought into proximity. So one would assume there's a force acting on ferromagnetic materials when brought close to a magnet, probably following an inverse square law (As per most fields) - how does one calculate the force acting on the paperclip (or any other ferromagnetic material) when the 'strength' of the magnetic field is known, together with other charactersitics of the subject ferromagnetic material?


What about for paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials? I know that it's possible with a sufficiently strong magnetic field, to exert a significant force on diamagnetic materials as seen with that famous levitating frog experiment (did it survive?)

13,How do I use a milling machine to grind a curved surface with a stationary bit and no CNC program?,1455601957,"Hey all,

As the title says, I am currently looking for a way to grind the curved surface of a copper weld shield to remove weld spatter. We are currently clamping the shield and removing the spatter with an angle grinder but this is not very effective as we need to maintain the original curvature of the shield. It needs to sit flush against the inside of a pipe. 

We have a milling machine similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqTzOpDCEA

Ours is larger and but the concept is the same - the bench can be moved along the x and y axis and we attach a clamp onto the bench. The bit can only be translated vertically. If we were to simply just clamp our shields onto a clamp and use try to cut a curve using x-y wheel controls against an end mill, we are going to run into the same accuracy issues.

Does anyone have any ideas on how we can accomplish this? We are currently thinking of building a rotating arm that can clamp the shield which we can just pass through the end mill at an arc. Is this possible or will it cause too much vibration and inconsistency with the feed rate doing it by hand? If we cant do it by hand we could also use a servo motor to guide the arm to ensure that the feed rate and vibration is minimised.

Picture of copper shield: http://imgur.com/a/GjtfK
The copper shield is around 1.6 inches across, so we're probably going to be using an end mill bit with a 2 inch cutting length.

Illustration of current idea: http://imgur.com/hpWgUxb
The arm and pivot position will be adjustable to maintain an accurate curve radius and cut depth. Will this work as intended? From my research usually the bit is the moving part and the object should be stationary.

15,"Digital Logic Question : In FPGA, how do you fix setup and hold issues assuming the clock is fixed?",1455597822,"I got this as an interview question once.  I'm going back and thinking about it.

Usually if you have setup violations in FPGA, you can slow the frequency down, but that's not an option in this scenario.  I assume just analyze the failing paths to see if you can code in extra pipeline flop stages between big chunks of combinatorial logic.  Anything else?

For hold time violations in FPGA, that usually means either your clocks aren't phase aligned correctly, and is not arriving at all the flops at the same time (within skew tolerances).  Or it could mean you have loading issues, like a PLL equivalent that's driving maybe 6 clock buffers (BUFGs for Xilinx) that you assume would all be phase aligned, but due to the loading, they're not.  Timing reports should tell you this if violated.  Is there any other way to fix these or causes?  Maybe force placement of buffering to increase data path delay, but that would get tricky to lock down when place/routing.

EDIT: This could very well have no practical solutions as maybe it was an interview question just to see how you think...

29,What should I use for this parabolic mirror?,1455569699,"I was trying to make a parabolic mirror to set fires in my firepit without kindling, saving time and wood. I tried two ideas for designs so far.

The first one is a mylar sheet hot glued to a satellite dish. The problem with that was that the hot glue set too fast, causing wrinkles and bubbles because I couldn't flatten it out fast enough.

Here's a picture of it (you can see the glue how it didn't spread out enough to create a flat surface):

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5sMaMz_oPVYLUUySGc3VTlHems/view?usp=docslist_api

 

The second thing I tried was to cover the opening of a plastic bowl with a mylar sheet. I used duct tape to try to make the seal. The problem is that it won't hold a vacuum when it is drawn from a hole drilled into the bottom of the bowl. (After the hole is covered with tape.) I think the reason it didn't work is that because I used a bowl instead of a cylinder, there was extra material that would fold over into flap-like pieces. (Like if you were putting a strip of duct tape perpendicular the the center axis of a cone, there would be one edge that would touch all the way around, but extra material on the other edge.) (It would be like putting a belt on a bowl or cone.) I think I may just need a cylinder shaped object to get it to seal.

Ok, so that may sound complicated, but here are some pictures to make more sense:

Here's the finished product, which wouldn't hold a vacuum, despite the 3 overlapping duct tape layers. (It kinda dips down in the middle, but I think that is because it isn't stretched all the way on all sides):

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5sMaMz_oPVYazU2bkUwYlZvbFE/view?usp=docslist_api

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5sMaMz_oPVYdU93MnVSNU0tRGc/view?usp=docslist_api

 

Ok, so the questions I would like answered are:

Should I use little mirrors hot glued to the satellite dish? Or should I use adhesive spray to stick the mylar sheet to the satellite dish? (The mylar is pretty reflective, probably comparable to an actual mirror. Here's two pictures for comparison:

Or should I even get some kind of cylindrical dish. (With one side open) and stretch and tape the mylar around that?

If I get the little mirrors, should I get any old reflective craft 1cm mirrors? Or should I get another type of 1cm mirror squares?

35,Replacement bearing for electric/automatic knife.,1455550178,"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/u6gFKBx.png4  
&gt;*Bearing dimensions*

&gt;-   bore diameter (from shaft measurement)
&gt;-   outer diameter
&gt;-   thickness
&gt;-   bore measurement after wear
&gt;-   shaft measurement after wear.

This knife is older than I am, and I have kept it since early childhood for nostalgic reasons. Unfortunately the use of an inappropriate lubricant(s) has caused catestrophic bearing wear in very short time. It did solve the ""It makes too much noise"" issue neatly however.

The original bearing appears to be some form of cast iron. Because the bushing needs to be self-aligning to accomodate the shaft oscillating w/ the blades, it matches a spherical socket in the body of the handle.  I do not want to alter this socket.

I have been unable to find a *ready made* spherical bushing of appropriate dimensions (with clear food safe composition), or a self-aligning roller/ball bearing that would not require modification.

Would a making one from a knot of hardwood be appropriate, or should I get a chunk of cast iron from a furniture shop?

Thus far my failed atempts to fix include:

-   Reversing the bearing so that the (previously) intact end points torwards the gears.  After a few uses that end got flogged out too. 
-   A oil-wetted paper bushing insert to remove the slack.  Got pulled out by the worm gear and impressively compacted after a few uses. Wore down the middle, making the wear suprisingly parallel.
-   Skate bearing. Misunderstood part code and ordered incompatible size.


(I don't know what lubricant was applied, I presume that they mixed all types on hand by spraying w/ out cleaning. {graphite, silicone, lanolin, canola and mineral})",AskEngineers,lynxSnowCat,/r/AskEngineers/comments/45wyl0/replacement_bearing_for_electricautomatic_knife/

i have been looking into solar generators , generators in general and the HHO generator. 
if i set my 100W solar panel up to a HHO gas maker. (panel powers the HHO generator) then with the HHO system running can i hook it up to a generator in some way or some way to store the gas to be injected into my generator. so essentially i wanna use a solar panel to turn water into brown gas then use the brown gas to power a 4.5kva generator.
essentially going from 100watts to 4.5kva . obviously the generator wont be able to run 24/7 but if my solar panel was charging a battery as well as powering the HHO device would it not be feasible to store the gas generated enough to power the generator for a few hrs per day to recharge the batteries (or back up batteries on a switch on/off system) 
i dunno just an idea on how to generate power during the day via solar and run a generator off HHO gas when the battery bank gets low to top them up for extended use. ie a duel fuel system that makes its own fuel, (electric from solar) (HHO gas to power the generator ) 2 battery banks that switch over to the other when the power is getting low to allow recharge while the 2nd bank is being drawn from.

47,What would happen to the total flow of water if I join two pipelines that are at different pressures?,1455493722,"Hi.
I've read some other posts similar to this one, but more questions arise.
What would happen to the total flow of water if I join two pipelines that are at different pressures?

Situation is more or less like this (I apologize if I don't use the correct or more common expressions for some terms)
Pipeline 1 is 12"" and has a flow of 180 m3/h. Pipeline 2 is 30"" (it's currently 28"", but will become 30"") has a flow of 1500 m3/h. Flow is gravitational starting at a dam and ends in a free discharge after 60 miles. Pipes are pressurized (completely filled with water). They both start at different locations (and heights) and meet halfway, where pipeline 1 is at 65 bar and pipeline 2 at 30 bar and they continue side by side to the discharge point. The idea is to check if it's possible to merge pipeline 1 into 2 and add the flow of both. In terms of capacity it's possible to carry both flows. 

From what I thought and afterwards read in this subreddit and other forums (please correct me if I'm mistaken), if they join the pressure at that point will become one (duh) and it will be determined by downstream conditions. Water should not flow from the higher pressure pipe to the lower one because of the discharge point. BUT to equalize the pressures, the higher one should lose energy and I don't know if that's possible without affecting the flow (they don't want less water and they can't extract more).

In this case I believe CLK_Y must be twice the frequency as CLK_X in order for this to work on a single signal going through a double flop synchronizer that is clocked by CLK_Y

If signal_X is unstable at the input first flop due to not being aligned with CLK_Y, why wouldn't the second flop possibly also latch in an unstable value on the same clock cycle, and hence propagate a bogus value downstream in CLK_Y domain logic?  Is it because of the ""clk_to_Q_output"" time of the first flop would guarantee the unstable value would not make it in time for the second flop to clock in a bogus value?

1.	Through dual enrollment and AP, I will have knocked out most, if not all, of the requirements of my AA by the start of Fall 2016.
2.	I will be getting Bright Futures, and probably FL Pell, so it won’t be *impossible* to afford either.

5.	I’m originally original from Orlando.

The problem is, that the sensor has an extreme sensitivity to radio waves. 

The sensitivity of the sensor is about 5.8 cpm per microSievert per hour. So the usual background level is about 2-3 cpm. If you hold a cellphone about half a meter away from the sensor it detects up to 10000 counts at once. That would be 1.7mSv and the measurement would be off by a factor of 1700, wich is not tolerable.

Is there a way to shield the sensor from radio waves without the case getting too big or too heavy? Would simply wrapping it in aluminium foil be sufficient?

77,"Keeping 2200lb+ aquarium on 2nd floor; new build, do we need to reinforce our (engineered hardwood) floor? (Details provided)",1455351875,"We are building a new home in a subdivision, and we'd like to be able to keep our reef aquarium in the dining room. The wall it would sit against is an outside wall, but the tank would be positioned perpendicular to the floor joists. I know it's ideal for something this heavy to lie across a bunch of joists, so we are concerned that the weight will be an issue.

We asked the designer, who said it's out of her depth; we need an engineer's opinion. Would we need to reinforce the joist(s) under the tank, or are we looking at something more substantial like a beam underneath it, or maybe some kind of platform/post arrangement in the basement? 

The aquarium is 72""l x 24""w, with the long side against an outside wall. One end will be also very close to (about 12"") a second outside wall. 

The glass tank holds 180g of water, plus rocks and sand. The tank alone is a couple hundred pounds; we estimate it weighs over a tonne when it's full. 

Right now we are in an apartment with concrete floors, so we have never had to worry about the weight of our tank. The last thing we want to do is stress the structure of the new house, so we're willing to do whatever is necessary and then some.

79,Engineering grad school prestige versus cost? A&amp;M/Michigan,1455333266,"Hi guys,

I'm a Texas resident here who has gotten acceptances from these two universities so far: UMich and A&amp;M. Michigan is ranked quite a bit higher than A&amp;M, but tuition is 45k out of state versus TAMU's like 10k. I did apply for a thesis option, since I'd like to aim for R&amp;D or design after grad school. I'm wondering if the difference in prestige (and I'm assuming opportunity if I decide to go for a PhD later on.. much later on) is worth it? TAMU has more work/research in the area I'd like to specialize in (power electronics/motor drives and general RF/emag stuff). I feel a little shallow even considering UMich simply for ""prestige"", but...?


Are there is any benefit in terms of career/job searches when it comes to choosing one over the other? I'm aiming for R&amp;D/design positions - stuff like Sandia National Labs or Boeing R&amp;T. I'm not familiar with how these schools are perceived from a recruiting standpoint.


If it matters, I did my undergrad at UT Austin last Spring. I've been at Texas Instruments since. I'm not sure if it'll be perceived as a ""step down"" by attending TAMU, no offense meant to any Aggies out there.

Any help would be great guys, thank you for reading!

5,Help with ooblek-like mixing in large tank please?,1455243787,"So forgive me if I am not asking the right people.
I have a project where I have to 'wash' cornstarch with a solvent (can't get specific here). We originally tried to use a hydrocyclone to do this for us, but we found it doesn't wash the way we want (too many passes) and the yield factor was unacceptable.
So now, we are just going to do a settling method whereby we agitate the starch and solvent and then let it settle. Then we draw off the solvent and add new solvent and agitate. It take approximately 6-10 hours to settle again depending on the number of washes performed. This is all well and good and we got what we wanted. The problem comes with the scale up of the project. The only vessel we have to work this has a large propeller type impeller with a slight pitch.
What I left out above is that when we draw off the solvent we are left with ooblek, basically. I do know that we can shoot some of the solvent at the ooblek and break it up pretty well. The problem is that the amount of corn starch to be washed would be quite a bit and I'm afraid we won't be able to get into it enough to get the agitation to start up properly.
Right now I know it's a 5 HP motor with a gear box. I have no idea what speeds or torque the gear box is at the moment. I DO know that said vessel/motor/gear box has successfully mixed viscous materials before, just none a thick as an ooblek. My other plan for this is to add an ordinary mixer to the top of the vessel with impellers that do not dip into the ooblek and mix it up from there. We have seen that top mixing like this will eventually draw up the cornstarch into the solution. This is not an optimal solution though for various reasons.

10,"EE scared of accepting job offer, advice?",1455235219,"x post from r/careeradvice

I'm an electrical engineer in the UK with just over 3.5 years experience after graduating with an MEng. I've been working in my current company for 1.5 of those years. Thing is, I hate it. And I want out of my current city too. 

There is a definite 'pin drop syndrome' in my current team and I could, feasibly, arrive in work and go the whole day without talking to anyone (if I didn't have any questions to ask). It depresses me. This is miles away from my previous job, which was all about interacting with contractors, the client, and other engineers as well as balancing construction works all being undertaken at different stages. There was a really good atmosphere. 

I joined my current company to get more solid experience in electrical engineering, to understand the principles and carry out electrical design and simulations work. I thought that working in a consultancy would, y'kno, involve consulting clients and generally helping people who need your expertise. But every day is a grind. 

My previous company approached me to offer a position and return to work for them, in a different team. I understand the position and broadly what it entails, but there is no solid job description to go by. Having had the offer on the table for a while now, tomorrow is the deadline to get back to them and I'm still at a total loss what to do!

I'm also keen to spend some time travelling, seems like now is a good time to do it.

My dilemma is: 

- stick at current job for another year or so and change my attitude, keep learning the technical stuff, enjoy the 43 days paid vacation I've currently got for this year then, having served my time at this company, use it as an opportunity to leave the city I'm in and try something totally new? Even a year out doing TEFL seems appealing right now.

- return to my old job where I've been offered a nice 15% pay increase, standard 33 days paid vacation, work with great people, a more practical job, and knuckle down for a while longer and don't scratch the itch of moving on to a new city.

Oh yeah, my girlfriend has just graduated and could start her career anywhere in the UK in the next 6 months. Great!

12,"In deterministic simulation, what are methods to generate an optimum output database by intelligently selecting inputs, when simulation runs are costly?",1455220414,"Frankly I have trouble succinctly describing the field of study I'm looking to find. The purpose of this post is to discuss possible solutions to my problem as well as finding references on the topic.

I am using a software that takes a few dozen inputs and generates a set of outputs (a matrix). It is very costly to run this simulation. The outputs from many runs of the software will be gathered in a database. This resulting database, when complete, is to be used for determining outputs by interpolating on the set of arbitrary inputs.

**What I'm trying to do is to minimize the necessary simulation runs to generate a database that optimally captures the features of the output space. That database will then be used to substitute running the full simulation.**

(
Specifically, I am in the nuclear engineering field and have a transport and burnup code (the software) that generates reactor libraries (the output) based on reactor parameters (the inputs). These reactor libraries will be collected in one database to be used in nuclear fuel cycle simulations. 
Instead of running the full transport and burnup simulation every time a new and different reactor enters the simulation, a database will be used to estimate the reactor library based on the reactor parameters.
)

In other words, I want to characterize the topology of the output space when sampling from this space is very costly.
 
Once an output is generated I am able to quantify its difference. So I am asking about the input selection side of the issue, not how to handle the outputs. Feel free to assume that you can make use of the output in any reasonable way to feedback to the input selection methodology.

So far I've found that simulation optimization covers related areas such as:

* Gradient based search methods (finite differences and frequency domain method)
* Stochastic optimization
* Response surface methodology

These are of course solutions optimization of outputs based on one objective function, whereas I'm trying to optimize the selection of inputs as well as the resulting set of outputs. 

A (bad) example for this problem that I've come up with is steam tables. Let's say we have a mathematical model to determine properties of the fluid based on inputs (pressure, temperature, etc.) and we want to generate a steam table by using the results from the mathematical model by running it many times. We would want to make sure that given any input in our domain, using the table one can get the desired properties by interpolation (and know the maximum error is bounded). How would we select the minimum amount of simulations, and how would we use the outputs to decide the next inputs?

* The simplest solution is to pick a step size for each variable and generate a grid of outputs (this wastes resources for low variance regions)
* A similar solution would be to start from the edges of the domain and sample center points, focusing on regions with highest variance
* Another solution is to pick an input set where each variable takes it's most common value (not so trivial), and to determine partial derivatives of each variable around that point to inform which direction to move and sample next

My heat exchanger is this:
http://i.imgur.com/X4PRZ6N.jpg

Measurements is in cm and it's 4cm thick. And every fin is basically just hanging on the underlying tubes, so no solid attachment.

It's connected to a 4x4cm aluminium water block with a pump between. Water flow is roughly 5-10ml/s :
http://i.imgur.com/UnAnCMQ.jpg

Due to lack of measurement equipments I haven't been accurately able to measure ∆T between the intake and outtake of the heat exchanger. But the available info I have is that when the system equalizes, I have ~250°C on the hot side of the thermoelectric module and the cooling water stabilizes at 60°C. The heat exchanger is only cooled by natural convection so no forced air flow.

So here is why I'm sceptic, considering the size of the heat exchanger and the amount of heat flow (~133W according to manufacturer which I doubt) I think the cooling water should stabilize at a much lower temperature! 

So the question is, is my heat exchanger a pice of crap? Or is this to be expected?

I can't find an answer to why flaring is the default solution for disposing of unusable/untransportable natural gas, rather than just venting it.  I understand that it's probably better from a global warming standpoint, but the whole concern with global warming is relatively new, and it seems that flaring has been the default solution (over venting) for a long time.

I suppose safety might be a consideration, but I can't see how exactly.  It's my understanding that natural gas is lighter than air, so wouldn't venting it from the top of the rig avoid any risk of suffusing the rig/platform in explosive gases?  

I completely understand that burning things is fun, and the flare is more exciting than just a vent.  But the flares attract and kill birds and insects, and require pilot lighting equipment to be engineered, purchased and maintained.  Venting seems like it would be cheaper, simpler, and less deadly to wildlife.

&amp;nbsp;

May I request some information with respect to performing a limit-load analysis, upon a pressure basic cylindrical vessel, within Ansys (alternatively dubbed Workbench- I'm not quite sure of the difference)?
 
&amp;nbsp;

From my understanding, which comes from the rather convenient university knowledge sharing hub [here](http://personal.strath.ac.uk/j.wood/CCOPPS_DBA/Notes/dba_intro_content_1.htm#a6), I will require to gradually ramp the pressure until a point where-in I shall see excessively large deformation for a small pressure step increase.
 
&amp;nbsp;

My questions are as follows:
 
* Will I require to use a non-linear material model, since I am exceeding the yield stress? Or can Ansys handle plastic deformation without any additional tweaking to the settings? The advice given on the page linked above indicates this is not the case as it states ""assumes an ideal elastic-perfectly plastic (or rigid-perfectly plastic) material model and small deformation theory"". That said, it also mentions ""as yield is exceeded regions of plastic strain develop and the response becomes non-linear"". This all makes sense but I'm unclear on which model is applicable.

* How can I validate the results of the model as empirical test data is not available? Although I cannot use hand calculations for the neck of the vessel, I can determine the expected stresses &amp; hopefully deformation for a given pressure at the cylindrical (thin) walls.

* Is the pressure at which excessive plastic deformation occurs equivalent to the 'burst pressure' of the pressure vessel? If not, can anyone direct me to the type of analysis I will require to perform in order to determine the burst pressure?

This project is something I'm doing to try and build additional knowledge and capabilities, therefore any advice is welcomed!

So here's my thinking -- is there a device I can build that would be able to disrupt the signal from the key when located within a 10-12""?  This might allow me to narrow down a specific part of the car to focus my search on.

43,Machining Advice,1455136540,"I am working on a set of spacers (essentially large washers) for an engineering project. The spacers are 6061 Aluminum and have these approximate dimensions:

* Length: 1.3""
* Inner Diameter: 3.25""
* Outer Diameter: 3.34""

The stock we are machining has these approximate dimensions:

* Length: 12""
* Inner Diameter: 3.25""
* Outer Diameter: 3.5""

Seems easy enough right? Our first thought was to do the following:
 
1. cut the stock down into a more usable size (6""). 
2. Put the stock into a lathe.
3. Turn down the Outer Diameter to 3.34""
4. Cut/part the stock to our desired spacer length

But we've been having a lot of issues. The absolute biggest issue is with the runout on the stock. When it is rotating in the lathe there is a significant wobble that makes turning the outer diameter nearly impossible (even at lengths of 3 and 4""). We've tried adjusting the chuck grip but it just can't seem to be corrected. The second problem is with the desired length. We want a final length of 1.3"" and this doesn't leave much material to grab onto in the chuck. The low thickness of the stock makes things a bit scary as well.

I have a set of large open-back planar magnetic headphones (Hifiman HE-500). I'm trying to design a modification that would make them **easily convert to closed-back** without a huge change in sound quality.

Some background:

* I have prototyped these using 3D printing. Six versions in, they're improving incrementally. 

* First versions were ~15mm deep, flat back, no bass ports. No bass response, very harsh treble.  

* I added some small bass ports. Bass improved, isolation suffered, harsh treble remained.

* Several versions later, I'm using a **concave interior**, 20mm deep, and a unique method for bass porting that allows for a good amount of air flow while retaining isolation/minimizing sound leakage. I feel like I might have come up with something pretty cool that can only be accomplished with 3D printing. **Bass is much better, but treble is still harsh.**

* Adding cotton/paper in the cup behind the driver doesn't seem to reduce treble harshness. Adding foam discs **in front of** the driver (in the ear pads) helped, but did not completely resovle the issue.

Can anyone offer any insight into how I could approach improving the design? I'm not looking for anyone to design it for me, of course - just to understand if there's some basic principle i'm missing here. My concern is that I'm going down the wrong path, using the wrong materials, or that it is really impossible to achieve good sound with this mod.

I'm puzzled here because there are plenty of closed-back headphones that have great bass response listenable treble without bass ports and without tons of crap stuffed in behind/in front of the driver.

Do you guys have any ideas on why there's no flow going into the tapping line when the pump is turned on?

One of our contractors installed an RO at the discharge line and there was no significant change and there is still no flow at the tapping line. I've calculated the pressure drop, which is only 0.1 bar.

My initial thoughts on why there's no flow on the tapping line (1cm diameter) is that the velocity of the discharge flow causes a siphon effect everytime the pump is turned on which constricts the flow inside the tapping.

76,"In snow conditions, why does the precipitation melt on side roads and parking lots, but not on main roads?",1455029074,"I am located in Nashville, TN. Its not too far below freezing (26 degrees). Today I noticed that snow/wintry mix tended to ""stick"" more on main roads (collector and arterial roads). These roads do get more traffic. The smaller neighborhood roads (local roads) and parking lots seem to have a warmer surface and melt the precipitation. Why is this?

I am a civil engineer and some of my thoughts are that it could be due to some of the following:
1.  Road bed is thicker under main roads for durability, resulting in the warmer earth being further from the road surface.
2.  The bituminous asphalt topping has worn off the busy roads while it remains more in tact on the less busy roads and parking lots. This makes sense because this topping is black and could retain heat better.
3. There is more (and larger) aggregate in the asphalt mix for the larger busy roads. Could this cause the road to retain less heat?

82,"Stresses on my climbing wall anchor: opinions, please",1455002630,"I am mounting a climbing wall onto the side of my house. It is a simple design of plywood attached to a wooden framework. 

Please look at the diagram I've attached: http://i.imgur.com/K96eagw.jpg

""A"" is the climbing wall (2.7m high)
""B"" is a pulley system attaching it to the wall (anchored at 2.4m, the highest it can be mounted on this wall)
""C"" is the supporting wall

The climbing wall rests on the ground and pivots there, as the wall itself is raised and lowered (increasing/decreasing the angle of the climbing wall to the horizontal) using the pulley system.

You will see that the lower edge of the climbing wall doesn't rest against the supporting wall but approximately 40cm out from it. This is because there's a column on the wall which prevents this.

The diagram shows the position of the climbing wall when the ropes of the pulley system are horizontal. This puts the climbing wall at 60 degrees to the horizontal, quite a steep training angle for a beginner.

My question:

I'd like to bring the climbing wall closer to the supporting wall to make a steeper angle, easier to climb on.
My gut feeling is that, the higher the climbing wall is raised and greater the angle of the pulley system to the horizontal becomes, the greater the force on the wall anchor will become.
Is this one of those situations where the force on the wall anchor becomes significantly greater when the attachment point of the pulley system (the attachment point on the climbing wall) is above the wall anchor compared to the forces acting when the attachment point is below the wall anchor?

I'm very grateful for your having read this far and I'd value an expert opinion.

90,I recently remembered some crazy interview stories I had when I was graduating. I wrote the experience down and wondering what anyone else went through. Share your thoughts!,1454984642,"Do you remember any interesting interview questions?  

When I was graduating college, I went on a barrage of interviews at many top engineering companies.  I had interviews with major automotive, oil industry, agriculture industry, aerospace, defense, and top consumer goods companies.

A few of these companies stick out to me in my recollecting the process I went thru after graduation.  One was with a major automotive manufacturer.  The company flew me to the state and put me up in a hotel for a night for a full day Saturday interview.

An industrial company with a welcome-to-the-on-site-interview banquet.  A wonderful meal with great food and free drinks.  Eating dinner with young, cool, charismatic employees at the company.  Then there’s a surprise case study that you have to research, work out the best engineering and financial cost/benefit analysis, and then presenting the very next morning.  Here’s your laptop.  Be ready to present to a panel of judges at 9am.

One company that makes you pass two intelligence tests.  One test is online, on your computer, in the comfort of your dorm/house/library.  And then one proctored by another person sitting in the student center.  Then a weeklong trip to the city with tours of all the factories and manufacturing floors.  

Then the one that I will spend some time telling the story:
What would you do in a situation where they have an actor/employee role play a situation with you?  They sit you down at a table with one other person.  A young engineer, perhaps.  There are two or three observers that sit in the room and tell you the setup of the activity is.  They tell you that the other person at the table is your college group assignment partner.  There is a third member to your team that is not currently present.  The group project that you are working on together is due tomorrow.  It is either a written report or a group presentation.  Begin scene.

The activity starts and the other person is now in character.  You ask the person if they have their part of the presentation done.  They do not.  They have done nothing.  They need to leave for a date soon.  They don’t want to be here.  This college course is of no importance to them so they do not really care about a good grade.  You ask the observers if the third person did their part of the group project.  

Their answer to you is “you create the parameters of the situation that we didn’t tell you.”  
Thinking that I, like many of my weight pulling colleagues, have run into this situation a few times in our academic career, and so I jump into that mindset.  I plead with the other person to do their part right now, or tonight!  I ask why they didn’t tell me sooner.  I ask the observers if I can email the professor and ask for an extension.  They don’t answer you.  They repeat the phrase above.  

I tell the actor that I will have to do their part tonight and present tomorrow.  I would tell the professor that they didn’t pull their weight and that I thought their grade should reflect that.  (As an aside, I’m curious how professors would respond to that situation.  I wonder if some would believe you and take that information into account when they graded you.)
But back to the story.  The role play is somewhat hectic.  The whole experience, thinking back, felt very stressful.  Here you are, being graded in an impromptu acting gig in the middle of room with a few other people, and of which you have very little information and a lazy idiot as a lab partner.  You don’t have time to sit back for a while and ask yourself that question over the course of a few hours in a real life experience like the scene.  Your actions right then… in that room in the next five minutes… will determine if you get a job at this respected company in this very modern assembly plant.  There are two or three pairs of eyes waiting for your answer.  You feel the pressure.

So in the course of a few minutes, I explained to my lab partner that I was going to try to continue getting ahold of the third group member.  My hopes were that I would convene with the third partner soon after the planned group meeting, or tomorrow morning, or over email that night.  And we would split your portion of the report since we had both done ours.  But… if she hadn’t done her part either, I would do her part and do the presentation/report myself.  Again…They don’t tell you in the beginning that the third partner was actively engaged in writing the report, or if she had done nothing.  They won’t answer you when you do ask them for the previously stated crucial information to this experience.  Your mind fills in the details.  And it does so by referencing previous experiences.

Then they end the scene.  You exhale strongly, wipe the sweat from your brow.  You exclaim that you’ve never heard of this kind of interview question before, because you haven’t.  No one online, or in class, or in forums or honor societies, no one talked about about these questions.  So the activity is over, everyone shakes hands, and leaves the room smiling.  It was exhilarating, in a way.  A rush related to being put on the spot so abruptly.  No one at the company had told us it was coming, either.
So lately I randomly thought back to that interview question.  And I wonder what other people say, if they’ve been through something similar.  I would like to hear answers, because after going through the experience and knowing every detail of the room, and knowing what question they asked and the situation they put you though, do I have an amazing answer.  I’ll write it up.

I've already got 90+ credit hours, basic physics courses taken care of and almost enough math to change majors. I haven't taken any junior or senior undergrad level physics courses though, just the pre-req physics courses. Since I'm looking into nuclear power it wouldn't be too bad of a start to grab an entry level job requiring only an associates degree. I'm looking into contractor work as a health physics technician. It pays better than most every job in my area and is seasonal, which allows me to take classes with a good amount of money in the bank. I am hoping to ask some questions about it here. 

The gist of it, as far as I know, is maintaining health and safety practices in a plant by adhering to strict guidelines for monitoring radiation levels. If I made a guess of what I'd be doing in my first outage, it'd be shadowing a junior or senior tech while taking courses onsite. I plan to be ready to pass the certifications by the time I apply though to help my chance at the job. I am hoping to run into someone on reddit in this career path and ask some questions to start preparing to apply.

I'm currently jobless and not in school, I usually work at the school I go to and can't attend school without a job or money in the bank.

I'm finishing up my masters in aerospace engineering and am fortunate to have multiple job offers. I've narrowed it down to two - 

* Systems engineer (operations analysis) at Lockheed Martin Skunkworks in Palmdale, CA. 
* Product definition engineer (design rotational, holistic) for Rolls Royce in Indianapolis. 

Salaries and benefits are comparable, work-life balance is comparable, the job itself is comparable (as far as how interested I am in it).

I have the following concerns with Lockheed

1. Working in isolation due to secret clearance
* Long commute due to desire to live closer to LA

I don't have experience with either of these situations and am not sure how they will affect me.

One of the questions I've been trying to answer is how these positions will affect me long term. Right now, I believe I want to go into technical or managerial leadership and pursue an MBA within the next 5 years. If I only stay at these jobs for 3-5 years, and my long-term goal is to work in a major city on the west coast in a more managerial or lead position, does one of these offer a distinct advantage? Is one of the companies more respected within the industry? I also have a preference for commercial over government.

Any guidance is appreciated! I know many of these things I need to decide for myself, but it feels like a very big scary decision.

8,"Is there a point at which computer analysis models are not checked manually or by hand? If so, at what point? How does this affect liability?",1454920272,"As a student, much of my work has been by hand.  Of course I understand that this, in theory, helps us to learn the material .  However, I know that much work in industry is completed using software (though it is often checked by hand.)  Many of my professors have repeatedly reinforced the idea ""junk in = junk out"" (regarding the over reliance on computer programs and modeling software for analysis and design calculations and the disastrous consequences of doing so), which I agree with in a general sense.  It seems to me, however, that at some point it is not practical/possible, nor necessary, to check the outputs of a complicated, computerized engineering model.  Perhaps one can roughly estimate the solution by hand, but precise solutions in some cases are only feasibly done through a computer.

To me, this problem seems especially apparent in systems which are large, time-dependant, and/or variable/uncertain.  For example, when doing hydraulic analyses for a large pipe network, it seems as though it would be very expensive to have someone verify that all of the situations are accurate or generally close.  Now, I could see using the software to determine critical case and manually verifying those, but this still seems like some situations might result in overly complex and lengthy hand calculations (which may be prone to error).

I am not advocating for lazy or sub-par standards in engineering practice, but I am wondering how you all view the issue of computer modeling software, hand calculations, and professional liability (reasonable care, etc.)  I recognize that this may differ by field and welcome any thoughts. Answers to these questions would be especially helpful.
*At what point would you consider a computer/software model to be sufficient (because it cannot be hand checked with precision, etc.)?
*How do professionals utilize and balance the need for hand calculation verifications and the efficiency of using software modeling programs?
*What are the current standards for use of computer simulations and software as far as liability is concerned?
*At what point do you think engineering students should be introduced to engineering software and modeling programs?
*Do you foresee the standards of practice changing as it relates to the use of computer models/software as a sufficient design document (i.e. without need for hand calculations)?

The device under test has a flat surface which is put in contact with the bottom side of the plate with thermal paste; for correct measurements, I'd need to have all the device's exposed area at the same, constant temperature.
The source of heat is/are heating resistors placed on the top side of the metal plate. They are required to be in package [TO-220](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/090/941/387/387941090_920.jpg), which makes them similar to point sources, I guess.
How do I get a good, constant temperature distribution of the metal plate? I'm thinking about using 3 or 4 resistors, in a linear pattern or at the vertices of a square. ",AskEngineers,senor_homme,/r/AskEngineers/comments/44o1nd/how_much_homogenous_is_the_temperature/

20,Electric metal melting non-arc furnace and mosi2 heating elements ?,1454877778,"Hi,
I saw a youtube video about an electric furnace capable of melting aluminium .

This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en4yhzLuD9A

I want to build a furnace like this but I'm looking into improving it. 

That nichrome wire isn't too good above 1200C. That's not high enough to melt steel

There's kanthal wire which might go as high as 1400C. Might melt steel but it's borderline.

Next best thing appears to be a material called ""mosi2"" or Molybdenum disilicide. It should attain 1700C without the need for flooding the furnace with a oxygen free gas. (though I might do that anyway)

I think these are the best element that are still reasonably priced and will let me attain the highest possible temperature (under 500$).

This is what these elements look like.

https://i.imgur.com/VZNgAOD.png
https://i.imgur.com/qNlZdwX.png

So there is the ""L1"" portion and the ""L2"" portion.

What is the L2 part for ? Does this part of the element emit heat ? Does it have to be inside the furnace chamber or is it going to create a cold spot ?

Another issue is how to wire such heating element so that very little heat exits the chamber. I don't know how hot the connection terminal of that heating element will get but once it gets in contact with copper wire, that will sink a lot of heat, the insulation could easily melt and it might sink so much heat that it  never reaches 1700C.

Another question is how to measure the furnace temperature. K type thermocouple don't work about 1250C. S type thermocouple one ebay are 200$USD !  Are there other options under 50$USD ?

any advice appreciated !

- Planet is eccentric
- Only one face of the Planet and see its Moon, i.e. the horizontal bar on each disc should remain parallel. The bars are for explanatory purposes only.
- Planet's rotation axis may shift (vertically along the green bar), but the Moon's orbital axis is fixed, i.e. Moon should be always in contact with the outer ring housing

My question is: how should the two discs be connected in order to to have the above properties? I've thought about using springs, but I think it'd be quite flimsy.

I know about orreries, but typically they don't self-adjust orbits though. Also, I was hoping for a simpler mechanism given that there doesn't need to be empty space between the two discs. I'm just trying to model the motion on one plane only.

For calculating the pressures at the shoe, i've been using two ""bubble equations"" which take into account the different hole capacities (Average bottom hole capacity and average hole capacity at the shoe) and the use of either original mud or kill mud depending on the well control method used.

I am interested to see if anybody else has experience with the Bubble equation. I can't help but think there must be an easier way of determining the shoe pressure when the bubble reaches the shoe.

Bit of a long shot asking this question as i'm guessing most people will typically use software!

Many Thanks and I look forward to any comments!

63,How do you know that you're right?,1454688838,"Hi everyone, I'm a Junior Mech E with what i feel is a big fundamental problem and I'm not sure how to fix it. I have a really bad habit of designing things wrong. 

I design and build a lot of little projects from a custom touchscreen radio, to a 3d printed air intake, to a jewelry stand as a gift among dozens of other projects ive built over the past year including designs for my co-op. And all of the designs have had one thing in common: they were all wrong at least once. Even the ones for work. 

It doesnt matter how many times i check my measurements, or how many times i review the model before building/3d printing the design it is always wrong on the first try. The radio is on its 4th attempt. A table made for sorting at work was wrong 7 times and my term ended before i could finally get it right. 

Now theres some psychological things influencing this, but that doesn't change the fact that i am never going to be as successful as i want to be if i keep making even basic designs wrong. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How did you counteract it? And if you haven't had an issue like this, how did get to the point where you trust your own measurements and calculations?

I thought a push/pull cable system might work, powered by a motor going back and forth.  You'd probably have to have some sort of special geometry ""track"" for the cable to ride in, in order for the force to be applied in the right direction on the lever, though. 


Also, maybe a motor aligned with the lever pivot axis, having an arm of the same length bolted rigidly to the object lever.

I have graduated in december 2014 and started working from april 2015. I am 23 years old . 

We target quite extensively to the MEP contracting companies by approaching the procurement dept or going to the site directly to get the enquiry . For some reason I have a lot of respect for the project managers / Site engineers and Site consultants of these projects. What they are doing seems very cool to me. Although I do not have the complete idea about how much work they do. But something about working on the construction site has really appealed to me. Being part of a project from start to finish must be absolutely amazing. 

Is there a way I can become a project manager in the MEP Contractors/consultants companies ? I do not have  strong electrical engineering basics ( I did not study well in college and wasted my time playing video games and doing nothing) , my design skills are non-existant and I do not know how to use Autocad.

I originally posted to /r/machinists, but I didn’t get much attention. Please note that I am NOT an engineer, so I hope you can forgive my ignorance on certain aspects. 

**Background:** My family’s small business purchased a tiny and dying business several years ago, and part of the deal was several Barber-Colman 6-10 gear cutters. The business we bought had a legacy line that used a lot of helical gears, and we’d like to keep it running. The hobbers are in good condition and have seen use for many decades. We were taught how to use the hobbers, but only with the set-up sheets that they had on hand. We have no problem cutting the gears that we have the set-ups for, but can't quite figure out a custom set-up. Experimentation has been limited for fear of breaking something.

**Problem:** I need help in designing the gear dimensions so that I can plug them into the worksheets to figure out my machine’s setup to cut.

Here’s what I’m trying to accomplish: I have gear blanks measuring from .54"" to .58"" diameter. I need to produce two helical gears that mesh at right angles [like this](http://i.imgur.com/ZlCBVzP.jpg) (so, same handedness) with a ratio of .158. This will take a 3 tooth and a 19 tooth gear. 

Is diametral pitch, tooth size, and the helix angle a function of the information constraints above or can I ""choose"" to carve a gear with deeper or shallower teeth? In other words, if 10 engineers all tried to design a 3 tooth gear and a 19 tooth gear for a .158 ratio using a .58"" blank would all of their diametral pitches be the same, or does each designer have the option to make the teeth different? (I know many things are generally standardized such as the pressure angle, etc.) 

**I’m at a loss on how to:**

**1) Pick which blank size (.54, .55, .56, .57, or .58) I need**

**2) Determine tooth shape and diametral pitch necessary (how do I figure out the appropriate tooth angles etc. for a given ratio, etc.)**

I have been reading everything I can online including a lot of the Boston Gear Gearology stuff and the KHK publications, but I keep missing something vital. I have enough set-up worksheets and I've found some online calculators so that once I determine the gear's dimensions the setup on the actual machine should be straight forward (I think...).

Just for additional information, here’s the gears for a .210 ratio that we cut and have the setups for http://i.imgur.com/S9qv0hk.jpg and here’s the setup sheet for those gears http://i.imgur.com/IGmnor8.png 

Any help you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. We’re a small business, and this project has been given to me to figure out, and I’m not certain how to take it further. Thank you so much for you help!

I would just like to clarify how I’m supposed to add resistors to it.
http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/414/RC-461048.pdf


I’ve calculated that I need resistance levels between 30 kOhms and 100kOhms (100kOhms = power supply operates at max current, 30 kOhms = 30%, my desired minimum current). So I’m buying 10x resistors at 10kOhms 1/4W power rating; my question is how I should connect everything together. Are there any nifty tools I can use to attach the switch terminals to the resistors wire (eg. Waco clamps), or should I just solder by hand.


The power supply has two cables, Dim+ and Dim -, that will be attached to the switch. So I’m guessing I connect Dim+ to Terminal1. Connect a resistor between each terminal, and 3 resistors (or one 30kOhm resistor) between Terminal10 and Dim -.

14,Oscillating motor questions,1454535001,"I'm attempting to make an oscillating knife for a CNC project, I think I've narrowed my approach down to two main options:

1) [Crank and control rod](http://i.imgur.com/8VSbZhQ.jpg), or
2) [Jig saw mechanism](http://i.imgur.com/wSvgzpF.gif)

The first is from a commercial cutting knife, the parts would run about $200 for just the crank/control rod/guides, and then I need a motor etc so probably $400 all in?  The second option would be to just take apart a jigsaw and use the mechanics from that.  The jigsaw shown in the diagram is about $250 but I'm guessing I can probably get one for significantly less, so maybe $150-$200 all in?  

My basic requirements:

* I'd like about 1000 strokes/min, even better if I can control variable speed somehow (PWM?), doesn't have to be controlled via CNC but it can be
* Stroke length of about 1""
* Doesn't need a lot of torque (cutting through fabric)
* Smaller size is easier to manage (the motor alone on the commercial unit is about 6"" long which is unwieldy but not impossible)
* Lower price is better but I'm willing to spend more if it will last significantly longer

Any thoughts on one approach over the other (or is there a better/cheaper/easier way)?  And anyone know of a vendor to buy cranks and control rods like this from?  Looking up the items for the commercial knife, the crank alone runs about $60 (I'm sure because it's specific to their product which I don't really need).  I didn't see anything on McMaster or Amazon but it could be under a different name than crank?  And suggestions on a motor source (I see lots on ebay and other sites but don't really know how to differentiate good vs bad) if I go that route?

Using a control arm and guides will take up more space than the jigsaw approach (where the crank/control mechanism is allowed to move from side to side freely, part #877 in the second diagram), but are there significant advantages to doing so?

If you think about it in terms of polar coordinates, the ""r"" axis is fixed, but the theta/angular axis is unconstrained.  I'm wondering if there is another mechanical analog that is a dual of sorts, where the members can vary in length, but are in a fixed angular position.  In terms of polar coordinates again, ""r"" can vary, but ""theta"" is ""fixed"".  Maybe think of a set of rails, with sliders representing the varying lengths.  Or somesuch.  Maybe it uses ropes instead of rigid members.  Hopefully I'm not being too obtuse.  I'm coming at this from an electrical circuit concept of [duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_%28electrical_circuits%29#Duality). Where you can transform a circuit with loops/meshes, into a circuit with nodes.  

The idea would be to constrain the movement of the mechanism in the same way as a set of mechanical linkages (for example, the [Chebyshev approximate straight line linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_linkage)), but using a different (the dual!) mechanism.

Maybe there is a well developed theory for this that you could point me at, or maybe there is no direct mathematical counter part, but there are ""reasonable"" approximations that are interesting, or maybe this is complete bunk.

28,Leave a big project for a more exciting company? Advice wanted.,1454507053,"Hello all, I'd love to hear some advice.

I'm a mid twenties engineer, mechanical by degree, currently working for a big automaker as a process designer and manufacturing engineer. For the past 2.5 years, I've been working on the design of a new assembly line for a brand new product. The automation equipment is being installed currently, and the line will go through initial run tests and enter production within the next year.


I've been on the project since initial start, but was recently offered a position at an aerospace firm in California. The position is, for all intents and purposes, the same as I currently hold. Roles and responsibilities are the same, salary (after adjustment) is the same, and benefits are nearly a wash. I'm struggling on a decision to leave my current project to go to the aerospace company, or stay.

Currently, I work a pretty casual workweek. 40-45 hours, with anything over 40 hours being paid out as overtime (of course with the assembly line project nearing an end, I'm sure that'll go up to 45-50). My company prides itself on the quality of life it provides its employees. At the aerospace company 50 hour work weeks would be on the light side, as it has a reputation for overworking and burning out its engineers with 60+ hour weeks.

I describe myself more as a work to live, rather than a live to work, individual. That being said, however, sometimes I think that my current work isn't enough of a challenge, and that I'm just skating by without being pushed. The aerospace company, I think, would definitely change that.

I struggled after college but I'm finally happy in my current living situation, and my current work situation. I'm nervous to leave that behind to start a new career at a more exciting company (especially one with a reputation for burnout), especially considering that the big project I've been working on is so close to an end.

Instead its relatively simple calculations for power and generally throwing lighting designs in relux and getting it to do the calcs... I just feel that all the physics and maths and HV and HF stuff seems to get wasted and that doing drawings dont require as much skill as you have.

43,Ducted Compressed Ram Jet,1454442537,"Ducted Compressed Ram Jet (DCRJ)

The DCRJ works in the principals of air pressure to actuate all major components. I
am attempting to stop the rotors and turbine from spinning and allowing the stators
to spin freely around the rotors, essentially switching places with the rotors.It works
in the exact same way as a turbine jet during takeoff and landing operations. After 
climbing to altitude and reaching a sufficient air speed, which is approximately 160knots
but can change based on air density and other variables, the RAM air pressure 
begins to build at the inlet of the engine.  When the build up of air pressure occurs
it engages a braking mechanism along the compressor and turbine shaft. Once 
the braking mechanism is actuated it disengages a braking mechanism holding the 
stators from spinning.  The braking of the turbine will allow an increase of pressure along
the turbine blades which can overcome a tension system to feather them until the air 
flow is as smooth as possible.  The stators are spun around the rotor blades due to 
the ducted fins that are coiled around the outside.  These fins do not create any extra
drag because of a tension spring flap on the leading edge of the nacelle. The duct that 
is exposed when the tension spring is overcome by air pressure, is also used to 
direct air flow onto the braking mechanisms.

64,Anyone have any history of being made redundant at a job?,1454369957,"First some backstory. I graduated with an engineering degree. Took a few months to land my first job and started in Jan 2015. It was a small company but things are/were going pretty well.

Last week they reveal that due to financial problems they need to make redundancies. They intend on judging everyone in a fair way by making sure those best qualified stay on. Well our team has to lose 1 person. Im the youngest and most recent employee by at least 2 years. Due to my short stay at the company im still very much learning and am definitely NOT nearly as qualified as the others for the position (just take my word for it).

So after 1 year ive found myself (likely) without a job and only 1 years experience in an engineering field. I feel ive essentially lost stock in the eyes of employers since ive barely learned anything but im also one year older than all the new graduates. I feel my next position would still need to be a graduate position as i simply dont have enough understanding to jump straight into a more senior role.

So im looking for any advice. Looking into it im legally only entitled into 1 weeks redundancy pay. Is it worth potentially volunteering to be redundant in hopes it may improve an offer from the company? What should i make sure i do, get references for future?

In terms of going forward how can i make myself attractive to future employers. Im 25 years old and im going to be competing with fresh graduates; what can i do to not look like some old washout. Hows the best way to present this on a CV, can i just say made redundant?

My big big concern is the fact my role was a proposals engineer. it was sold to me as a good way of getting my foot into the industry. Just as i was about to be given the opportunity to work in other engineering sectors of the company, this happens.

1. Since the magnetic field is generated with permanent magnets, the coils do not need any additional excitation. Correct? Just by turning the rotor I will develop a voltage V_out?

2. What will the voltage, current, and frequency coming out of the coils be? 

3. Imagine I am turning the rotor by hand. If the resistance of the load is increased, will I feel an additional resistance to turning the rotor if I try to maintain a constant speed of rotation? What about if I keep my mechanical power into the rotor constant as the electrical load is increased?

3. If the load is reduced to zero (short circuit), will I feel any resistance to turning the rotor? What about if the load is increased to infinite resistance (open circuit)?

4. Assuming I am turning the rotor by hand and delivering a torque T at a constant speed w, then the stator must also be experiencing some torque (Newton's 3rd law). If the stator was mounted on bearings such that it was free to rotate, but was also coupled to a mechanical load (like a pump), how would this affect the performance? How much of my mechanical power into the device would go to the mechanical output of the coil assembly, and how much of the input power would go towards the electrical load?

Scan an invoice and send that to the customer system for more information. Customer passes invoice data back to us after we request it. Customer confirms invoice data with us at a different time.

If I construct two heat exchangers of equal internal surface area, and air flows through both at equal mass flow rate.

Heat exchanger A is made from 24x 1.125 inch inside diameter tubes 40 inches long.
Heat exchanger B is made from .562 inch inside diameter tubes, the number of tubes has been increased, and the length of the tubes have been decreased such that heat exchanger B has the same surface area of heat exchanger A, but air friction has tripled.

it is clear to see that heat exchanger B will capture more heat, but how much more.

Heat exchanger A is presently installed on top of my wood stove. to give you an idea of the mass flow rate.. we can easily capture 2kw of heat (that would have been lost) from a small fire, burnt in a high efficiency recently manufactured wood stove.

bonus points for heat exchanger C:
Double the internal diameter of the pipes, cut the length in half, surface area is the same but now the head loss is 1/16th that of heat exchanger A.

am I correct in assuming that heat exchanger C will be 1/16th as effective as A, if not, how much less.

76,"Compressible flow project: mass flow rate, force of thrust?",1454339654,"Hi,

I'm working on a mini project and ran into a few problems.

Setup: an empty 2 liter bottle has a hole drilled into its bottle using a heated paperclip to make an orifice, which a thumb tack can fit tightly through to act as a seal. A car tire valve assembly is attached to the top of the bottle through which compressed air can be pumped. The bottle is attached to a toy car after being filled with a certain pressure of air (10 psi increments, from 30 psi to 60 psi) and the thumb tack is removed. This creates a stream of air that acts as a thrust force.
Unfortunately, I'm relatively new to fluid dynamics. When I did my research but after several days I left more confused that when I started. Here are my problems:

1. THE NATURE OF THE FLOW: Adiabatic indicates no heat loss from air crossing the orifice to the outside, while isothermal indicates no temperature change from one side to the other. Compressible/non-compressible I don't quite understand, and I'm fairly certain my flow is choked given that (pressure of outside)/(pressure of bottle) &lt; 0.528. Choked flow aside, how can I tell which, if any, my setup is? This affects the equations I can use. Could anyone with a greater depth of knowledge explain how to identify adiabatic vs. isothermal vs. isentropic or compressible vs. non-compressible, particularly for my setup?

2. MASS FLOW RATE Best way to calculate this? I realize that there are a TON of equations out there; given my setup, the crude and small nature of the orifice, what would be the mass flow rate equation that would be best to use in terms of ease and accurately describing the data? Time-dependent would be ideal, such as here, since my pressure and temperature change over time due to air loss: http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/786430-dbaImH/webviewable/
(the equation, however, suggested that a very marginal amount of psi was lost in the first 10 seconds. This conflicted with the fact that the bottle seemed to make quite a bit of noise as if a decent amount of pressure was lost. Alternatively, if this one should work, am I doing something wrong with my setup or plugging in? I'm willing to use differential equations and other calculus if necessary, as long as the equation gives reasonably accurate results (80% accuracy, give or take a few, maybe?).

3. FORCE OF THRUST &amp; EXIT VELOCITY AT ORIFICE: I recognize that this is equivalent to (mass flow rate)*(velocity of gas at orifice). However, I am not sure how to calculate this velocity which, due to pressure loss, is also changing over time. Is there any time-dependent velocity equations of a compressed gas through an orifice that I can use that account for this pressure loss? I could use this relation:
(mass flow rate) = (density)(Area)(velocity of gas) --&gt; velocity of gas = (m.f.r.)/[(density)*(Area)] but that assumes I can determine mass flow rate to begin with. An equation independent of m.f.r. but dependent on time and pressure would be ideal.

4. COEFFICIENT OF DISCHARGE &amp; ROLLING FRICTION: I consulted several resources and could find no consistent agreement on the value of the coefficient of discharge, only that it was approximately between 0.7 and 1.0. I was wondering if anyone who was an expert in this field might know, given the nature of the orifice created, what to use. Same with coefficient of rolling friction; it's between plastic wheels of the toy car (car's about the size of a ti-84 calculator) and smooth marble tiling, and was wondering if anyone knew the best approximation.",AskEngineers,kuffyruff,/r/AskEngineers/comments/43oup5/compressible_flow_project_mass_flow_rate_force_of/

I've read that it's not a good idea to rub two surfaces of the same material against each other, e.g., plastic against plastic, metal against metal. Plastic against metal is preferred. Why is this the case? Is it because that the coefficient of friction is higher for same materials?

According to [this site](http://www.tribology-abc.com/abc/cof.htm), steel-steel gives 0.5, plastic-plastic gives 0.3, but plastic-metal gives 0.25.

83,2nd Moment of Area,1454319593,"Hi all,

I'm doing some work with the 2nd Moment of Area of several aluminium profiles for my company and I'm having some trouble find the derivation for the 2nd Moment of Area formula (∫ y^2 dA). 

I understand what the 2nd Moment of Area is, how and why it's used but I'm having trouble find where the y^2 value is coming from. I've shown what I've found below.

I = Summation of Moments about an axis

=&gt; I = ∫ Moments = ∫ F * Distance =  ∫  F * y

F = Stress * Area = Ϭ * dA

=&gt; I = ∫ y * Ϭ * dA

Here's where I'm lost, I'm not sure how the Stress component reduces to y to give  I = ∫ y^2 * dA.

All I've found about the stress was this:

""linear elastic stress at any point on a cross section is a linear function of y times the extreme fiber stress"".

250 lbs       - Gravel
100 lbs       - Other crap?

About 1400 lbs

The joists are 13"" apart and 2""x8""x12'. running east-west. The floorplan of the basement is open, the ""wall"" that you see in fishtank3.jpg is just cheesy wood paneling with some kind of framing behind it. Not sure if it's structural. The only support(?) in the basement would be a 4""x4"" pillar off to the side of the stairs as seen in fishtank1.jpg.

Hi.  I'm a senior MechE with very little knowledge about circuits.

Is this a normal DC response from an amplifier?

A peak value is used when measuring stress as it is proportional to strain, therefore we seek the maximum displacement.

41,Bearing between two concentric shafts,1454046544,"Hi all,
I have a hollow shaft and a solid shaft. The solid shaft goes in between the hollow shaft. The two shafts are off different lengths, so the solid shaft protrudes outside the hollow shaft by 5 mm. On the end of both these shafts I am attaching discs that will rotate. These two shafts have gears on them off different ratios that are connected to the driver shaft. Anyways is there a bearing of some kind that I can put between the two shafts? That is the space between the hollow and solid shaft. For example my current design has the solid shaft with an OD of 20mm and the hollow shaft has an OD of 30 mm. and an ID 25 mm. That leaves enough space between the two shafts, but i can make the outer hollow shaft bigger (increase the ID and OD) so as to have something in between them that reduces the play between the two shafts. Because sometimes with the load, the inner solid shaft goes off center and that is a big problem for me.

42,Is there a study on uncontrolled system behavior?,1454045918,"When we, engineers, design any system we do a lot of study on the controlled behavior of the system. We concern ourselves with its response to real world situations and other external factors that we can think of for that system. That is all fine and we do a somewhat good job with that.
But here lies my question : Do we consider the system behavior when uncontrolled as extensively as when controlled? or Should we consider the uncontrolled behavior as extensively?

From what I know that we do it up to some level depending on the use of the system like a car shuts down when there is a problem in the engine, or a lift holds still when power shuts down accidentally and all that. My question stems from this [video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acqKWVaB1Lo) where the robot with a rotating blade loses its one half of the blade and becomes unstable. Could it have been designed better to handle such a situation? Or is there any use of studying the uncontrolled behavior so as to improve the system overall?

44,Why didn't they use a blunt nose on the sprint missle?,1454041656,"A recent [top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/4346jz/missile_accelerates_at_100_g_reaching_a_speed_of/) in /r/woahdude was a .gif of a sprint missile.  

[Gif](http://i.imgur.com/l7v5FzZ.gifv)

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvZGaMt7UgQ)

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_\(missile\)) and some relevant text:

&gt; The Sprint accelerated at 100 g, reaching a speed of Mach 10 in 5 seconds. Such a high velocity at relatively low altitudes created skin temperatures up to 3400°C (6200°F), requiring an ablative shield to dissipate the heat.[1][2] It was designed for close-in defense against incoming nuclear weapons. As the last line of defense it was to intercept the reentry vehicles that had not been destroyed by the Spartan, with which it was deployed.

&gt; The conical Sprint was stored in and launched from a silo. To make the launch as quick as possible, the cover was blown off the silo by explosive charges; then the missile was ejected by an explosive-driven piston. As the missile cleared the silo, the first stage fired and the missile was tilted toward its target. The first stage was exhausted after only 1.2 seconds, but produced 2,900 kN (650,000 lbf) of thrust. The second stage fired within 1 – 2 seconds of launch. Interception at an altitude of 1,500 m to 30,000 m took at most 15 seconds.

You can see in the video the missile gets going at a good clip and turns white hot from the heating.   

So, why did the missile designers selected a conical form?  I though one of the reasons blunt body's are used for capsule spacecraft was to decrease the heat load during reentry due to the location of the bow shock.  

Would a blunt body missile decrease the heat load on a missile like the Sprint?  

Are their any disadvantages (drag? guidance?) to using blunt body's for a missile?  

Edit: thank you everyone for the replies!  I guess I underestimated the effect of parasitic drag, thanks for the discussion.  ",AskEngineers,sailerboy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/43788n/why_didnt_they_use_a_blunt_nose_on_the_sprint/

Graduated as an EE but first job out of college was as a physical vapor deposition engineer for metalization of polymer webs and thin films. There I taught myself about vacuum systems.

It would basically be a stovetop distiller that had a Stirling engine powering a simple vacuum pump to create a low pressure scenario making the water evaporate at a much lower temperature. So you could put it on the stove, heat it up to get it boiling, the Sterling pump would kick in and lower the pressure.

--Ok I just realized that this might not really work. Because if the water is boiling it will be constantly expanding the gas volume so there would be no way to make a vacuum, and/or the vacuum pump would just be sucking up all the water vapor (maybe that could work..use the Stirling powered pump to lower pressure AND eject the vapor into condenser coils?)

I am working to build a steady state dynamometer to measure the power output and torque of a 750 Watt motor.

My current design idea is to directly attach the output shaft of the 750 Watt motor to a larger 1000 motor, that I will run as a generator. From this generator motor I will measure the voltage over a variable resistor. EDIT: To calculate power.

I am trying to work out the size of resistor I will need to be able to stall the 750 Watt motor. If the 750 Watt motor is 24 V, the max current output from that motor would be around 31.25 amps. I then did V/I to work out the resistor size which is roughly 1.3 ohms. Do those calculations sound correct? 

Also does anyone have an idea how to create a large variable resistor like this? I am imagining using a microcontroller to switch on and off multiple resistors to create the desired resistance. But then I don't even know which resistors I should look at using.

### What is this post?

One of the most common questions from people looking into engineering is *""What do engineers actually do?*"" While simple at heart, this question is a gateway to a vast amount of information — much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers created a [series of posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_an_average_day_like_for_x_engineers.3F) where engineers talk about their daily job activities and responsibilities. In other words, it answers the question: **What's an average day like for an engineer?**

The series has been helpful for students, and for engineers to understand what their fellow engineers in other disciplines do. The goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses here will be integrated into the AskEngineers wiki for everyone to use.

**Discussion and followup questions are encouraged, but please limit them to replies to top-level comments.**

### Timeframe

70,Selecting Components for a Low Pass Filter,1453959225,"I'm trying to build an in-line low pass filter to use with a headset while I'm flying. The plane I fly produces a high pitch squeal as (I am guessing) the generators turn. What's worse is they are ever so slightly out of phase, which means the tone has a distinct and random wah-wah-wah to it.

So I thought ""I'll build a low pass filter, that should be easy!"" However, everything I've experimented with seems to just universally dampen the sound and doesn't seem to attenuate the high pitches any more than the low.

My first setup was with a 1uF Tantalum capacitor (because the examples I saw used 1uF, and that's the only 1uF type RadioShack had in stock) and a 270 ohm resistor. That yields a cutoff frequency of about 600Hz according to [this calculator](http://sim.okawa-denshi.jp/en/CRtool.php). I selected that Fc because that should be the upper limit on human voices, and I think it shouldn't fully attenuate any higher-pitched alarms that I might need to hear. Unfortunately I can't audibly detect any change in attenuation all the way up to my hearing limit of about 14kHz. Everything was quieter, but there seemed to be no filtering going on.

I then tried raising the resistance step by step to lower the Fc down to some silly level, with the same results.

I read some other posts recommending using larger electrolytic caps, so I thought I'd try for larger cap and smaller resistance. At this point RadioShack was closed, so I pulled a big 680uF capacitor out of an old radio and tried resistors varying from a 10 ohm (Fc = 23.5hz) to a 33k ohm (Fc = .007) and only got the same result as before: flat attenuation across the spectrum.

I will admit that I only have a basic knowledge of the math involved here, and I don't know a huge amount about electronics. I just kind of started reading and doing. but I seem to have hit a brick wall. Any idea why this seemingly dead-simple circuit is not working as advertised?

75,Requirements to become an engineer,1453950403,"Hi all,

I'm new to engineering subreddits so please let me know if this isn't the most appropriate place to ask this question.


**Background:** 

I think I have always been good with numbers, I move to France as a kid and somewhat excelled in highschool physics, biology and maths, went on to study finance back in the UK because the engineering education path in France is absolutely dreadful, and I'm now 24 and working in a field related to oil&amp;gas, in particular on the commercial/analyst side of the oil tanker industry, abroad.

I have always loved science, and I have second-guessed my career path multiple times over the last 7-8 years as to whether I should have actually gone to study some form of engineering. I'm struggling somewhat with the corporate world of suits and ties, I find myself very inspired by people at the forefront of technological progress and sometimes feel like my current job is lucrative but unfulfilling on many levels.

After my BSc in Finance, I had considered starting over, and but ended up doing an MSc and going straight to work, but I'm wondering yet again if I wouldn't be happier working with research and science.

**Question:**

Now my problem is, that I feel like successful engineers were opening up TVs for inspection when they were 6 years old, or coding and hacking for fun when they're 14, or pimping out their dorm room and automating their curtains in their first year of university - you get the idea, always showing early signs of engineering skills, and for me aside from loving solving small maths problems in my spare time, and being very good in school, if I'm honest with myself I didn't show any of the other obvious ""he's made to be an engineer"" signs.

I would love to study engineering, to be surrounded by numbers, and people who love and appreciate numbers, but I'm wondering if I'm being naive that I can succeed and be an excellent engineer given that I haven't taken the path naturally so far - hell I don't even know what engineering I'd like to pursue, mechanical, aerospace, biotech... they all sound very appealing. 

I'm leaning towards robotics for instance, but every pioneer of robotics I read about was building AI systems before they could crawl. 

So here's my question: in the same way I'm good at my job now although I had never thought about it before joining my firm, is it possible to be an excellent engineer without being absolutely passionate about a subject before studying it? Given that I haven't pursued it so far, would you consider that to be an indication that I'm generally not suited for the trade?",AskEngineers,Tanker_Guy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/431cux/requirements_to_become_an_engineer/

80,Poiseuille’s law with velocity,1453927171,"I am trying to come up with a mathematical model so that, when the displacement of the plunger of a syringe is know, I can calculate the amount of a specific liquid in the barrel. Or the relationship between the speed of the plunger and flow rate at the tip of the needle (Again assuming that the properties of the liquid in the barrel is known).


I have very limited knowledge in fluid dynamics.

I made a quick research and found the Poiseuille's law for laminar flow


Flowrate= π.r^4 (P-P0) / 8.η.L


where r is the radius of the pipe or tube, P0 is the fluid pressure at one end of the pipe, P is the fluid pressure at the other end of the pipe, η is the fluid's viscosity, and L is the length of the pipe or tube 


P0 will be atmospheric pressure if I assume I am injecting in air.


P will be the pressure on the syringe plunger r is the radius of the barrel


η is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid L is the length of the fluid inside the barrel.


The flow rate unit is m^3/s when I use the SI units.


Also I have the Bernoulli's law to calculate the pressure difference between the syringe barrel, hub and needle, when their cross-section area is given.


So, I will be converting the Pressure at the tip of the needle (which is shown as pressure P2 on the illustration) to pressure at the barrel of the syringe to use for the parameter P0. Am I correct at this point?


Also, therefore, the length I will be using for the parameter L is the dashed red line, which is the distance between the plunger and end of the barrel. This is my assumption, since I already convert the pressure at the tip of the needle to barrel of the syringe. Is this correct?


If I am all correct up until this point, my last question is the following; I am assuming that I can exert enough pressure for the desired flow rate. How can I convert the P parameter into speed so that I can calculate the speed of the plunger for the desired flow rate?


[Here is an illustration for the syringe](http://i.imgur.com/FlAyQil.jpg)


My attempt is this; P = F/S


Where S is the surface area of the plunger pushing the liquid.


F = m.a


a = dv/dt


So, P = (m.dv/dt)/S


And when the desired flow rate is given, I would leave the dv/dt term on the left hand side and everything else on the right hand side, then take the integral of both sides to find the Velocity.


I am not sure though. This looks really complicated.",AskEngineers,eligloys,/r/AskEngineers/comments/42zjk8/poiseuilles_law_with_velocity/

I know that this is most likely just a strange coincidence, but just to make sure that there isn't something potentially dangerous (lots of gasoline around) I'm wondering what are the odds that the only three instances of car batteries mysteriously dying in recent memory happened at one specific pump rather than being spread out among any of the 12 pumps in total?

He makes a product called creamed honey which looks like this: http://imgur.com/0qT6Iaz ( I think it is popular in Europe)
Most factories appear to produce it through cristalizing runny honey in a deep mixer like this: https://youtu.be/1nTuaR4ka-4?t=29 Aparently it takes more tan 24 hs to get a single batch of 50-100 l  
We have something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoT_3Xj953Y whick scrapes and stirrs “raw” and hardened honey/beewax. A large 100l tank takes about 4 hs to cream, given that the blades descend through their own weight once the honey is soft enough to allow it to sink. 

Is there anything you guys think one could do to speed the process, maybe allowing the machine to feed on the tank horizontally (It is easy to heat the outside and have the hardened honey drop off while keeping its cylindrical form). Would some kind of hammer mil (like those used to shred stuff) help? It is important not to allow air to be mixed in

1,Trying to decided between aluminum or steel for a small stand carrying a big load.,1453858985,"I'm currently looking to build a small stand and trying to decide what material to build with. 

[Rough Mockup](http://i.imgur.com/P6doz8k.png)
Dimensions in that image are in mm.

Basic idea is as such:

* Main load (shown in grey) is ~200lbs
* Bracket in blue is bolted to the main load (up to 16, M10 bolts if needed)
* Main load + Blue bracket can rotate 90deg from the Pink neck.
* Rotation point would have a spring pin and lock in to pre-set holes.
* Pink neck needs access to pull that pin so I have a C shape to it right now. 
* Green base is fairly basic, welded 2x2"" tubing (wall thickness unknown)
* Should be 5x rated so it should take a 1000b load.

My initial thought was AL 6061-T6 but to my knowledge welding that weakens it, requiring it to be re-hardened. I like the aluminum because it won't rust and I can do a blast texture + clear coat. Also I could bolt the neck to the base instead of welding to avoid that weakening a bit. Currently the walls on the bracket (blue) and neck (pink) are 0.25in but with aluminum I'm thinking it'll need to be closer to 0.5in.

Alternatively should I use stainless steel? I'd love something that doesn't need paint ideally. Could I drop to a 0.25in wall thickness on the neck and bracket?

I'm thinking just 2x2"" tubing on the base, just not sure what wall thickness to use.

Because of the size I'm thinking I can fore go any cross bracing but I'd like some feedback.

11,How does this push-and-release-mechanism work?,1453829228,"Hi there,

I'm looking for any ideas/explanations on how a specific push/release mechanism works.
I have two examples in mind where this mechanism is present:

1. Older lamps had on their on/off button. You pushed the button in, the light went on and the button stayed in this position. Then you pushed the button again, the light went out and the button popped out a bit to its original position.

2. The effect is the same with built-in cigarette lighters in cars, don't know about the mechanism though: You push the cigarette lighter inside, it stays locked in the position, you push again and it pops out again.

Here is a link to a very simplified graphic. I hope this explains better what I mean.

22,Mechanically constrained magnetic levitation display,1453761330,"I have a 3d printed model spaceship (weight ~5.5 oz) that I think would be awesome to have levitating on my desk. I think something completely passive would be cool (instead of buying a display that I have to turn on and off or making something with an active feedback loop).

I think I've settled on using a grid of small high strength magnets on the base (to create a roughly even magnetic field at short ranges, say an inch or two), and a few magnets on the bottom of the model. I was going to mechanically constrain the model using thin fishing line. The fishing line is going to be looped through the model and affixed to the base, so the position of the model will be adjustable to find the least-unstable position. Then everything should be great as long as I keep it away from other magnetic objects.

Is there a reason this shouldn't work? Anything I should add to make it work? I have access to (and am trained in) machining equipment, so machining things isn't a problem.

It's been brought to my attention that I forgot to ask the engineering question. My engineering question should have been: Given that I'm making this model, what sort of arrangement should I put the magnets in (and how many should I buy) to balance the strength and uniformity of the magnetic field approximately 2 inches above the top of the base.

24,Does running a home refrigerator at 55-60F room temperatures (during winter to save heating costs) take years off the expected lifetime of the fridge?,1453754247,"**Tl;DR: Will running a regular fridge in a kitchen that is ~58F at night and ~55F on vacations in winter wind up taking years off its expected lifetime?**

**EDIT:**  Guys, I mean **THE ROOM THE FRIDGE IS IN** is at 55-58F, *not* the fridge interior is that temperature.
_______________

I posted this to r/Frugal and it [generated some discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/42f5rj/is_keeping_your_home_cold_taking_years_off_your/) and someone there suggested bringing it to you guys.

All this was motivated by a comment I read on a blog, found [here](http://www.permies.com/forums/posts/list/120/4906#56152) (search for the word ""refrigerator""...there is actually a few posts by that guy elaborating on the details of his view; his second response has even more detail). The idea is that although one might want to keep their home temperature low in order to save money on home heating costs, running the fridge under normal room temperature of about 70F is hard on the machine and will result in taking years off its lifetime. This is--I think, it was pretty technical!--because the fridge will cycle much less than it is designed to do, and therefore the a) motor will be not cooled enough, b) the compressor will not be cooled and lubricated enough. 

In that blogger's (extreme) case, he is keeping his home at a very chilly 50F and using ""microheating"" techniques to stay warm at his computer workstation. In my case, I am fine with keeping the house to 58F at nights (my small den stays warm merely from the desktop and two lamps, and my bed is warm enough for sleeping) and 63-65 during the days. On vacation (up to 3 weeks, say), I would set the house thermostat to 55F to save on heating while keeping the pipes from freezing.

Here is the crux of the technical guy's point, and the ""fix"":

&gt; asking the fridge to operate outside its design parameters will cause it to run at a much higher watt to BTU ratio, run longer to do the same amount of work, add additional heat to the refrigeration system from the external electric, and do progressive damage to the refrigeration system that are not noticeable but are significant in the overall life of the system.

&gt; This problem is fixed by reducing the air flow on the condenser which makes it less efficient allowing additional heat to build within it raising the pressure and flow rate to the minimum levels for peak operational efficiency and cooling. It allows the system to ""build enough head pressure"" to flow at the proper levels.

So, is this guy's view accurate? (Both in the damage threat and his suggested ""fix"")? Or is he off base, out of date, or what?

In my case, I have a March 2009 bought Jenn-Air side-by-side normal kitchen fridge. Their product book only says, ""Install the refrigerator where the room temperature will not go below 55F. With temperatures below 55, the refrigerator will not run frequently enough to maintain proper temperature in the freezer."" But this is a much different statement than it *harming* the fridge long term, and it doesn't address what happens if you run it at, say, 58F every night for a few months each winter or 55F on vacations.

Quick list of arguments:
***
**""What about Chernobyl/Fukushima?""**

Old gen II reactors without passive safety. Complaining about these is like complaining about the first ford car from 1890. New tech is basically fool proof. 
***
**""What about waste?""**
Long lived waste is a problem, luckily we can use this waste to power our society for thousands of years with -guess what?- new nuclear tech (gen IV). We can also use thorium. The waste is much less massive and also much less radioactive. Alpha particles can't even penetrate an A4 ark. The half-life of this waste is 300 years which makes it completely harmless to future civilizations. You could literally store it in a barrel in your garage. 

***
**""What about renewability""**
With the right reactors and the right fuel we could power our planet for millions of years. Today we wouldn't even have to dig the fuel up because we have tons of it stored over ground. 
***
**""What about nuclear proliferation?""**
We already have nukes, and we don't need more. Gen IV reactors (most of them) use a different fuel cycle that makes nuke production basically impossible.

63,Do you think it would be feasible to melt the surface of the moon from orbit prior to building a hypothetical base?,1453552399,"I was going to post this on /r/space, but I figure someone here might know a more technical reason about the feasibility of this.

Over the years I've read people mentioning the dangers of the lunar soil, specifically the abrasive dust that could make setting up a base difficult or unhealthy. The last NASA challenge had many teams suggesting 3D printers that would use the soil to build shelters. I've seen articles on the subject with space suits that attach to the outside of stations so the dust can't get in easily. (There's still a seal that could fail with dust so it's not perfect, but it's a start).

That said with all these worries about dust I've wondered for a while why we don't just melt the surface? The surface is mostly basalt and other volcanic rocks. Hypothetically these melt at 1,200 C, but let's say 1,400 C. (This might be a bad estimation if the heat dissipates somehow). Say between the dark and warm side the moon's surface is 0 C. The specific heat of the surface material (basalt rock) is 840 J/kg C. So 1,400 C * 840 J/kg C = 924 kJ/kg.

You can't do the whole surface feasibly so as an example say we chose a 2 km radius landing site. (PI * 2 km^2 = 6.3 km^2). Say we want to turn the surface 1 cm into rock. Then 36.3 km^2 * 1 cm  * 2.8 g/cm^3 (density of basalt estimate since we're dealing with dust) * 924 kJ/kg = 9.4*10^11 kJ of energy required.

To put that in perspective if we used the ISS solar panels that output 120 kW that's 9.4*10^11 kJ / 120 kW = 249 years. That said the Navy has only tested [105 kW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Weapon_System#History) systems planning toward 300 kW. To finish in 10-20 years (since orbiting means it's only in range half the time) would require 3 MW of solar panels or a small nuclear reactor. This would require ten 300 kW lasers to finish in time running all the time. Ideally settlers could land in the center as the lasers work on the radius spiraling out. (They could also use the lasers if they needed them).

My worries about such a proposal would be that it requires a massive amount of cooling. At say 5 MW power requirement that would be 42 times the solar panels of the ISS. (A 10 MW [Toshiba 4S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba_4S) is estimated at 500 tons so I'm not sure what's lighter or more feasible). I'm not sure that would be enough for cooling though. I'm not familiar with these laser systems though. They obvious run for a long period of time since they are designed to target and track multiple incoming mortars and rockets. If I'm wrong and these systems can't run continuously then that throws a wrench in the design. Does anyone know how much heat these kind of lasers build up? What's the fastest most energy efficient way one could cool the platform?

Also the platform would need to orbit a very far distance from the moon probably. Since the moon has no atmosphere (the laser would make quick work of the dust) would the attenuation be an issue? (We'd probably be talking like 10K km I think).

Any other things I'm missing? (Weight calculations probably. The ISS is like 925,000 lbs for reference).",AskEngineers,Sirisian,/r/AskEngineers/comments/42aolv/do_you_think_it_would_be_feasible_to_melt_the/

This is my tentative design so far:

http://imgur.com/ugl00Q6

Obviously, I need to make sure this thing can handle the pressure needed to brew espresso.

Typically espresso is brewed at 9 bar, but I want the emergency valves to be set to release excess pressure at a minimum of 20 bar, possibly higher. I want the system to be able to safely handle significantly more than 9 bar as well, just for peace of mind. 

First few questions:

How should I go about building the boiling chamber?

I was thinking I could buy a plate of stainless steel and have it stamped into the shape of my boiling chamber:
http://www.metalcraftspinning.com/stamping.php

I was hoping that 3/16"" would be strong enough for my purposes. Before I invest too much time into looking into this approach, I was hoping someone might be able to offer some advice since I know almost nothing. Will that be strong enough? Is there some production method that will work better? How exactly should I go about building the boiling chamber?

The other challenge aside from making sure this thing is strong enough, is designing the seals. I've thought about this a bit, and I think the best way to seal this thing up is to exploit the pressure required to brew espresso. In the design above, you can see that I've drawn clamps to attach the boiler cap to the boiling chamber, but after contemplating how I should seal the system, I realized that 1 bar of pressure is going to exert around 145 lbs of force on 10 square inches. If my cap had a surface area of 10 inches, at 9 bar that would be 9*145 lbs of force. I figured that the easiest way of sealing the system would be to use that immense force that the system was already generating to keep the system closed.

My question, therefore, is this approach likely to work? 

http://imgur.com/qCxsXRB

I imagine I'll have to make make the  boiling chamber have a rectangular hole in the top, with a lip, and the boiler cap can slip inside sideways. Obviously the lid is going to have to be bigger than the hole, so I figure this rectangular approach will make it easy to get it inside. 

I'm kind of wondering if it will be possible to create a boiling chamber of this shape though... So if anyone knows anything about that I'd love to know.

I am toying with another design, where I would have a boiling chamber and a steam chamber. The boiling chamber would sit on the heat source and will have extremely thick walls. The point of this is to act as a pressure reservoir. There will be a valve connecting the pressure reservoir to the rest of the system. When you start heating up, you open the valve all the way, once the system reaches 9 bar (or whatever pressure is desired) the valve is closed until it's only open enough to maintain the system at 9 bar (or whatever pressure is desired). I was thinking this design might be better, since it will be easier to maintain a constant pressure, and there will be a reservoir of excess pressure in case the user wants to increase the pressure of the system mid brew. My concern here is how safe this would be. How much pressure could I conceivably have in a really thick walled metal container? Could I have like 100 bar of pressure, ""on tap"" to apply to the rest of the system whenever I please? 

Any advice or help is greatly appreciated. ",AskEngineers,billybob_dota,/r/AskEngineers/comments/427k1t/im_trying_to_build_an_espresso_maker_i_have_a/
72,Naming convention Toray Carbon Fibres,1453496144,"Hi,
I'm an engineering student, studying for a materials science class (with a focus on composites).

In class the prof explained the naming convention of Toray, as a study aid to remember the properties of the T300 carbon fibre.
We have to know the properties of T300, because it is used a baseline and a reference for other (carbon) fibres. (We also have to learn the baseline properties of other fibres, to be able to make comparisons, and 'back-of-an-enveloppe' calculations.)

87,How can I calculate the yield strength of a bicycle handlebar?,1453453711,"What I got from Googling is that the yield strength is controlled by the second moment of area. But I couldn't find a formula. Anyone have a formula or a place to look? I'm just curious as to how much torque a bike handlebar can withstand. 

I know that the World Record squat is about 1300 pounds. The pedal is about half the distance from the midline of the bike as is the place where you grab the handlebar. So if someone were to apply 1300 pounds of force to the pedal, there would be an reaction force of 1300/2 or 650 pounds at the handlebars. Typical handlebars are 44 cm so half of a handlebar's width is 22 cm or 8.6 inches. Let's say that the stem, which connects the handlebar to the bike, is 0.6 inches wide. So that's 650 pounds of force with a moment arm of 8 inches. Or a torque of 533 ft-lbs, right? 

Handlebars are probably designed to withstand human forces, so would it be reasonable to say that a handlebar can withstand a minimum of 500 ft-lbs of force without yielding? ",AskEngineers,EmceeQubed,/r/AskEngineers/comments/424swn/how_can_i_calculate_the_yield_strength_of_a/

90,High School Robotics Team Looking for Help!,1453436687,"Hello, Engineers!

My high school team is entered in one of those High School Robotics competitions, and we're stuck on our design.

Right now, we have five motors, all attached to gears, all helping rotate one  driven gear. It works but with one flaw. In our design, we need to reverse the direction of the motors every couple seconds or so. This leads to current spikes to our batteries which they can't handle, so our motors start to slow down after the 20th direction change.

We're looking for a mechanical solution to this. If all our motors are rotating in the same direction, the battery should be able to power them just fine. So, is there a mechanical system that allows us to change the direction of the driven gear, while having the rotary motion of the driving gear stay constant?

I stumbled upon this gem:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmA9Vnu33FY

While this would work, it's very restrictive. We also have to change how much the driven gear rotates. In the system illustrated in the YouTube video, the driven gear has a fixed rotation distance! Would this additional requested feature void all mechanical solutions?

8,Where can I find and buy a 1/8 compression fitting adapter that will eventually get to accept a quick disconnect for a standard air hose?,1453403313,"I don't know where else to ask this, so I'm asking it here. 

I bought a Koolmist machine and it came with a 1/8 compression fitting for the air intake line. I went to Home Depot and Ace hardware and haven't been able to find an adapter or anything else to get it up to the size I need for a standard quick-disconnect fitting for a standard air tool, like I already have in my garage. 

This is very frustrating and I've found a work-around that holds for now, but I've already had it pop off on me once or twice... It's a little air brush adapter that steps the quick adapter down to 1/8 inch.... Something... The trouble is that I get a few threads in, then, when I go to tighten it down, it just pops loose and falls off. I feel like this is a temporary fix and other people in my shop have already used it against my wishes and the adapter popped off, leaving even less grip than there was before.

[x-posted]",1453383862,"I've been in my current job as a Quality Manager for 3.5 years. I had two promotions in that time and have gotten 115% of my merit bonuses each year, due to doing a good job here. It's my 2nd job out of college; I was in my first job for about 4 years. Although I'm a manager level, I don't manage anyone but interns - I have a hunch they gave me this promotion and title change so I wouldn't leave. (We have a really high turnover, so someone like me who has been here for a while is more valuable as time goes on.)

At the start of this month, I recently switched to a different area in Quality but kept my title. I just wanted a change in the type of work I was doing, a spot was open, I'd worked for the director before, so I figured it would be a good spot. Plus, I've been bored for quite a while.

Well, last week I got an email from a recruiter that actually sparked my interest. I have a phone screen today with HR before I presumably move to the next level to an in-person interview with the hiring manager.

My issues are:

1. I'd take a 10% pay hit if I take this job. (Big con.)

1. I'd have a title change back down to a Senior Engineer. (Slight con.)

1. My work-life balance would be immensely better. (Huge pro.)

1. My commute would be 40% of what it is now, and I wouldn't have to pay tolls each way. (Pro.)

1. The job responsibilities are nearly identical to the one I just switched out of internally at my current employer; the only difference is that it's in a different industry with all sorts of regulations I've never dealt with before. (Neutral.)

1. They've been looking to fill this position since November, so they are likely really eager to hire someone with my experience. (Slight pro.)

If all goes well in the interview process, I'll likely accept this job. My two questions are:

1. Would I be burning bridges by accepting the new job? I just started a kinda-new position at my current employer and I feel like I may be screwing them over by leaving so soon after this switch.

1. Given that they are likely really eager to hire someone for this long-open position, and given that I'd be taking a pay cut (and they'd be aware of this when I tell them my salary requirement) do I have an opportunity to negotiate salary, benefits, etc. with them?

17,Suggestions For a Compact Telescopic Lifting Mechanism,1453350512,"Hi AskEngineers! This is my first time posting on Reddit as I am out of people and places to find a solution to my problem. I am a mentor of a high school robotics team that has no professional mentors. The only mentors are a couple of programming teachers and me, a gym teacher (Yes, that's right, a gym teacher mentoring a robotics team). We need to make a mechanism that can extend up about 6 and a half feet off the ground to grab onto a steel pipe and lift our robot (over 150 pounds) up about one and a half feet. The mechanism must be able to extend and lift in under 20 seconds and hold on for at least 10 seconds. We are looking for a mechanism that is under 20 pounds (preferably 10 or under), will take up a very small space as the entire robot must fit within a 35"" x 25"" x 14"" (preferably not more than 5"" x 7"" x 14"", excluding motors) space as we have a bunch of other mechanisms to attach and it cannot extend outside of the length and width by more than 10"" but can go as high as you want for height (but it cannot start over 14"" in height) Grappling hooks and such won't work as the robot is not allowed to tip on its side as it violates a frame perimeter rule, unless there is a way to keep it straight. The mechanism will be located at the backside of the robot so it won't be near the CoG. The bar is made of 1.5"" steel piping and is protruding 5"" off of a wall that we are not allowed to apply lots of pressure on it. Hydraulics are not allowed but simple pneumatic cylinders and motors and such are allowed. We are looking for mechanism ideas and designs that are cheap (not more than a hundred), simple, reliable and somewhat easy to build (we have access to mills, lathes, cnc routers, lots of different parts). 

Here is an idea that we have come up with and we would very much like to know if it would be a good solution: http://imgur.com/a/RYuNP
Basically, it uses 14 inches tall of 1/8"" that is 1"" wide aluminum angle that slides up other angle pieces. To bring it up, we would use a FatMax Xtreme tape measure and a motor that is attached to the top angle piece. To lift the robot, we would just drive the motor in the other direction (measuring tape has been tested to handle 200+ pounds). We don't know how to connect the angle to slide on another angle without it breaking and if the aluminum itself can handle the weight of all the torque as it is on the far side of the robot and whether or not the measuring tape can push up the aluminum angle (weighing about 2 pounds in all). We are also thinking about using springs or something else to launch the angle pieces up and then using aircraft cable attached to a motor to wind us up. We don't know how to start with that idea and what we can use, however.

33,Can someone tell me why this wind turbine design won't work?,1453313755,"First of all, apologies for the lack of art.  My ability to diagram things was bad in first grade and has only gotten worse sense.  That said, I'll do the best I can to describe what I'm saying here and hope someone can make heads or tails out of it.

Second, I phrased my question this way in all seriousness.  I am 99% sure this won't work, but I want to understand WHY before I completely abandon the idea.

So...the background is this.  I am trying to make a concept car.  An electric van that uses 3 different power systems in the hope that by brute-forcing it with all 3 systems, I can extend the range far enough that it never needs to be plugged in and can still make reasonably long trips.  The obvious systems are solar panels coating the roof and a KERS on both axles, but I am asking today about the third system: a hybrid wind/water turbine.

Oh and I have no formal engineering training.  Yeah, I know, a CAR probably isn't what I should start with, but I'm ambitious.

I understand, to a limited extent, why a wind turbine doesn't normally work in a vehicle - essentially the drag negates all the energy generated so it's either a net gain of 0, or an outright loss.  I am not attempting that at all.

My design is to create a series of 2"" or 3"" channels, side by side, running the full length of the van and spanning the full width of it.  These channels are set directly above the windshield, and a spoiler at the top of the windshield directs wind and water coming off the windshield itself into the channels.  Inside each channel is not one fan, but a line of fans spaced approximately 6"" apart.  After passing across about a dozen fans, the air or water flows right out the back of the channels as expected.

Now, I am not asking about the practical end of this.  I understand weatherproofing all this and making it reliable will be a nightmare, etc.  I also understand that what is true for air is not true for water, so the answer may be more different for one than the other than I think it is.

That said, I am simply asking about the theoretical, energy-generating side of this.  It seems to me that, after causing some substantial drag on the first fan, probably negating all of the energy created by that fan, the ratio of drag to energy generated should steadily improve as the air or water moves back through the channel.  That is, each fan in the line will generate as much power as the one before it (because it's a tube, i.e. the air or water can't escape the tube any other way than going past those fans) but each should produce little to no additional drag on the car as a whole.

So...what am I missing?  As they say ""if it was that simple, someone would've done it already"" but I am struggling to see where this system fails.  Enlighten me, engineers :)",AskEngineers,chuckdm,/r/AskEngineers/comments/41vk4t/can_someone_tell_me_why_this_wind_turbine_design/
34,What is the formula for the power curve of a wind turbine?,1453313742,"Hi,

I am looking to create a function to calculate the power production of a wind turbine from the wind speed. 

The formula should be able to be created from the cut in speed, nominal wind speed, cut out wind speed, and rated power.

The formula that I have created is a piecewise function: 0 up to cut in, linear from cut in speed to nominal wind speed, and rated power from nominal wind speed to the cut out wind speed.

If I adjust the formula in the linear region to ^1.65 it is pretty close to the actual power curve, however this was just a test value. I thought it should be ^3 as the theoretical wind power increases with v^3 but it is farther off. 

If anybody has an idea of what I can do differently that would be a great help. Thanks.

Formula in B6, can be draged down to B50. 
=IF(A6&lt;=$B$2,0,IF(A6&lt;=$B$3,$B$1*((A6-$B$2)/($B$3-$B$2)),IF(A6&lt;=$B$4,$B$1,0)))

44,I'm designing a spud cannon (pneumatic) and need some help analyzing pressure/velocity of my system.,1453300946,"I posted this over in /r/engineers but it was deleted by mods.

I'm a mechanical engineering undergrad and am currently working on a pneumatic spud gun. I have taken fluid mechanics. However, the problems I have cannot be resolved via my textbook nor my notes (or maybe they can but honestly I don't have time to reread them all). My basic design for this cannon consists of a steel tank as my air chamber that is connected to a ball valve. This valve then connects to a 180 degree bend pipe that ultimately connects to my barrel. I'm having trouble calculating my output velocity based on Bernoulli's eqn. I cannot imagine that the muzzle velocity would not depend on the diameters/volumes of my pipes. Obviously, my air chamber is going to have a larger diameter than the valve/U pipe/barrel. I'm trying to figure out which equation(s) I'd use to be able to design this thing. Any help would be immensely appreciated. Thank you. Also, I will provide additional details of my general design idea need be.

Somebody in /r/engineers made it apparent to me that I should analyze this thing from a static standpoint at first - moving the projectile in each analysis to a different state and calculating pressures at those different states. This sounds like a good idea - I just don't know what equations I should be using.

EDIT: I'm also curious as to what type of effect the response time between me turning the lever to the valve and the valve opening has on my muzzle velocity. I'd make an assumption and say it's negligible.",AskEngineers,jeebasaurusREX,/r/AskEngineers/comments/41um1r/im_designing_a_spud_cannon_pneumatic_and_need/

55,ME Grad trying to choose industry/sector (MEP?),1453268555,"Hello all,

I will be graduating in April with my BSME. I have had 3 internships - one in energy with a MEP firm, one in biomedical devices, and one in manufacturing. My senior project is for FSAE (automotive) so I have had a pretty diverse engineering experience.

I chose engineering because I like problem solving, designing, and simply learning how things work. I did not come into my major with a specific industry in mind. I really feel that I can be interested in almost any topic and that what's more important to me is the company I am working for and the responsibilities they let me take on. What I'm looking for in a job/career is:

* Location: I want my workplace to be in or near a city. Preferably Seattle, but I am also looking at Portland and San Francisco. Location is very important to me, as it has a huge effect on my happiness. I don't want to be living in the middle of nowhere.

* Company: I don't want to get slowed down at every turn. I saw how slow the medical field moved and would like to avoid industries like this. 

* Work: I don't want to get stuck doing the same small task day in and day out. I would like to have a broad range of projects to work on and be able to see things from different angles. 

With all this said, and with the importance of location to me, I've really set my eyes on the HVAC/MEP industry. I definitely liked the company I worked for last summer and the people there, it's just not the location I want. I'm just starting to stress lately because it really feels like your first job *does* define your career to an extent. I don't want to jump into a job just to find out a year down the line I want to make a complete switch to another industry. Especially if everything I had been learning didn't apply to the new industry.

And I have read some reviews lately of people getting ""bored"" with the work they get in HVAC. It's just really not a glamorous or exciting industry on the surface. The only other industry i've really seen that can be found in or close to cities is product development.

So I guess some my questions are:

* How did you choose an industry/sector when you graduated?
* If you are in the HVAC/MEP industry how do you like it? Why did you choose it? Would you do it all again?
* Are there any other industries that meet my criteria?
* Do any of you work in the product development industry?
* There are so many MEP firms within a given city. How do you choose between them? What should I be looking for when I'm researching a firm or interviewing with a firm? I want to make sure I choose a company that will be able to train me well and really make me valuable in the industry. I want a company that can really help develop my skills. One of my biggest fears is getting my first job, working a few years, and realizing I haven't learned much or that I could've learned more if I had chosen a different company.",AskEngineers,tommybuoy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/41syws/me_grad_trying_to_choose_industrysector_mep/

I was wanting to make a hot air engine, using a car turbocharger(s) if possible.
(Hot Air engine was chosen to escape safety concerns of water, car turbocharger was chosen as a good quality low cost turbine/compressor that is widely available - if this is not the case please tell me :D)

Like all good engineering projects I want the world, and I want it all for nothing :D

I have a 21kw heat source connected to a 1.5m^2 heat exchanger, the heat exchanger is shaped like a U (cross-section,but upside down) exhaust gasses are piped into the top of the U and fall down as they cool. Expected temperature at the top of the U is ~500C. Expected heat exchanger material is mild steel. cold compressed air will be blown in at the bottom of the U, at a tangent to the edge to induce a vortex, and extracted from the centre of the top of the U
(heat source is a wood furnace)

I would like to get an electrical output of about 1.5kw to charge batteries. (but like the stones sing, you cant always get what you want)

how does the turbocharger efficiency map relate to the possible power output? some i have seen have an efficiency of just 77%. I am hoping that since this engine will not have varied power requirements (like a car) i will be able to park the turbo at its most efficient point and leave it there.

Most turbo's will only raise the pressure by 2:1, how many stages before my after compression temperature is the same as my heat source (500C)? How many stages before the friction losses in the compressors eat away all my power output? How do i determine the optimum number of stages?

Finally i would like ideas on how to convert high pressure hot air into electricity. currently i have thought of a power shaft off one of the compressors, A separate turbine from a larger turbo, or an electric supercharger.

I realise this may not be feasible, but i would like to work through the problem to identify the reasons it may not work for my own education.

1. **assigned by user** (mobile phone): A base station communicating with N phones needs N bands.
2. Or are they **shared between phones using an access control protocol** (like CSMA/CA for example): A base station communicating with N phones needs M bands. with M &lt;= N.

B) What is the difference between old school frequency division and OFDMA?

C) Can all of these methods (Frequency division, OFDMA and CDMA) be modeled as a graph coloring problem?

Our mechanical goal of operations is to successfully deploy a sail in zero g's. I am currently working on developing the boom mechanism to extend the booms outward. 

I have been doing some research and have come to the conclusion, which is to utilize a retractable roll able boom which will be used to extend the sail outward. Using this style of boom is the most efficient and simplest way to extend them outward.

I have found a site that supplies retractable booms. The site below is the best I could find, if you find any other sites let me know!

89,Arduino Question: Is it possible to connect 26 buttons to the Arduiono Uno? Do I need more digital inputs?,1453145419,"Hello everyone!

I'm building a schematic/flowchart/pre-sketch of a circuit which will be programmed using the Arduiono Uno.  It needs to have 26 buttons, but they can all  be controlled digitally.

My question is:  

Do I need 26 different inputs to be able to program 26 buttons to do something?

Or can I control the 26 different functions via a single input?

For example:

Is there a way to write something like...

int OnOffSwitchPin = 1

int BtnConfigSwitch = ?? (3, 4, 5, 6, ---26)  ((will be set up as array??))

void Setup

digitalRead (OnOffSwitchPin)

     if OnOffSwitchPin = High {

         digitalWrite (BtnConfigSwitch (3 ,4, ---26) = HIGH)

}



And then begin to write functions which the BtnConfigSwitch can perform.

I'm trying to assign each one of these switches to perform a certain function and to be able to use other switches to control how these functions are performed. (eg. switches are made to push a button, other potentiometers control the rate at which these buttons are pushed).

I'm sorry if my question seems vague, I'm new to Arduiono and to programming in general.  I hope someone will be able to answer my question.  I'm also willing to keep in contact with anyone through email or any other form of communication if they would like to assist me in writing and connecting this program/circuit.

I don't have exact specs but I know that the lever will be about 3000mm long. I know at maximum, the foot of the lever should undergo about 10-20 kg of force pulling it. The boom will pull back very hard and will try and will bend most CF thin tube.

Could the electric version be some sort of super electric heater, kind of replacing a combustor? Where after being compressed the air would be rapidly heated and have a similar enthalpy as products of combustion in a jet engine?

It could also use the sunrise/sunset times from the location and set an option for a timer before/after sunrise and sunset. For example. 10 minutes before sunrise, 20 minutes before sunset.

As you use your tipp-ex, one diameter will become smaller and the other bigger. Thus, for a certain amount of tipp-ex, one wheel will have to spin a fraction of its circumference, the other will have to spin a whole 360°.

I'm concerned that I haven't thought through this carefully, and would really appreciate your advice.

A bit of **background** about me:

* Australian
* Graduated Bachelor of Aerospace (was a double degree with Commerce, and got some decent grades) in 2011
*  Joined an Australian airline as part of the corporate graduate program
* Now work as a strategy / business analyst (for that airline), but realised recently that I'm not energised by the corporate career, and want to get into a technical engineering role
* Considering changing careers into aerospace because it was actually super interesting at uni, and I believe it's a highly worthwhile cause
* Looking to move to the UK in the near future
* I'm now thinking about applying for the MSc in Astronautics and Space Engineering program at Cranfield (UK), which looks like it could be really fascinating and a lot of fun (and hardwork!).

My **questions / concerns** are:

1.  Being ~4 years since I last touched a textbook, is there any chance I can get into the UK aerospace industry without having to do a post-grad?
2.  Cranfield seems to be the most recommended university, but are there others that I should also consider? (To avoid being too close-minded)
3.  Once I have graduated from the post-grad, what are the chances I can actually break into the space industry? I spoke with a Cranfield alumni last year, and it seemed like it's super difficult to find a job at the moment
4.  While I realise that I may not get to design the 'next big thing' in engineering, I do want to be in a career where I get to help push the boundaries of engineering (i.e. not airline aerospace, where it's mostly just box checking to see if your maintenance programs adhere to standards). Are there any common engineering career illusions that I need dispelled before I make a career change?
5.  Are there any other resources I should be looking into? (e.g. Aussies studying in the UK, Engineering careers, funding for post-grad, etc.)
6.  Is there anything I should be doing *now* to help make my CV / experience look better?

Hi,

I hope this is the correct subreddit for my question. I am in my 4th year of undergrad in aerospace engineering. For our project we are designing a cubesat. I am in a three-man team that is working on the command &amp; data handling subsystem, which is essentially the onboard computer subsystem.

Unfortunately, my program has taught me very little about electronics and nothing about computing (huge problem imo but has to do with accreditation). The most I've had to do was programming in C++ and Matlab and I have some experience coding in python and labview but nothing to do with hardware whatsoever.

My group seems content to just be googling things, but I hate doing that because the information I find is always so top-level and sparse. What I really need is an excellent textbook or book that will teach me what I need to know to start designing this subsystem, or at least how to get started in designing it. I don't expect to know nearly as much as someone who has taken computer engineering or electrical engineering, I just need enough to do what I need to do. A list of things I'd like to be able to know how to do so you get a sense of what I need:

* Calculate the minimum amount and type of memory I need (SRAM, EEPRAM etc. I don't understand these terms)

* Calculate the processing speed I need, or how to initially estimate it

* How to interface with different subsystems with different kinds of data such as GPS data, thermal digital data etc.

* How to calculate the kIPS? Or number of things per second, or what to ask the other subsystems

So as you can tell, I know nothing about computing.  I'm also interested in robotics and am taking a mechatronics course right now, so in general I'd just like to learn more about computing.

As an example, I have the book *Practical Electronics for Inventors* which I have been reading through to better my understanding of electronics. It has sections on digital circuits and microcontrollers but its focusing mostly on logic, how binary works etc. which is nice but not exactly what I need

33,Automotive Engineers: What is a realistic maximum braking deceleration of a passenger car?,1452904026,"Hello reddit!  
I've been analyzing some Event Data Recorder information and looking at the deceleration, and wanted to know how it compares to actual maximum deceleration.  
Let's say the car manufacturer reports that the braking distance is 136FT (41.5m) when going from 60MPH (26.82m/s) to zero. I calculated it out and it looks like it assumed a coefficient of friction of 0.89, and if I assume constant deceleration, then it ends up at 8.68m/s^2.  
So then, from the car EDR report, I calculated out that I was braking from a speed of 6.94m/s to 0.28 m/s over a period of 1 second, calculating out to a braking deceleration of 6.67m/s^2. This is about 77% of the maximum braking deceleration. At the time, the tires were in great shape, and the roads were dry, so I'd think the coefficient of friction should still have been close to 0.8.  
So, does a braking deceleration of 77% of maximum (pedal pushed all the way to the floor) under normal, dry conditions jive?  

**TL;DR** Pushed brake pedal to the floor, decelerated at 6.67m/s^2 versus actual car literature of 8.68m/s^2 with dry conditions, good tires, good brakes. Do actual conditions result in 23% loss of braking deceleration versus published?

   Hi! I am a 15 year old student and I am pursuing my life long dream of becoming a computer Engineer, but I need some help.
Ever since I was young, I was curious how just about everything in this world worked, whether it was the TV remote or the toaster, I wanted to know what was in there that made it function! As I grew older, my interest in electricity grew. Whoah! I press this button and that light turns on, *HOW*? How does this thin panel of metal and glass show color and video? How am I hearing sound through a metal box??? etc ...



So when I was 12, my dad (who studied Electrical Engineering) bought my first ever piece of what was to become my hobby for the next 4 years. An Arduino. My dad taught me the basic electronic components and from there I was on my own. A world full of interesting concepts for my 12 year old brain to pick a part and explore! I learned the Arduino IDE and from there moved on to Java and C++. Day and night I sat down on my computer typing away endlessly, trial and error at first, to write my first ever computer program. I was amazed when the calculator I had coded actually worked I had a sense of accomplishment that I had never ever felt before! Later that year, for my birthday I built my own Gaming PC. When I finally pressed that power button after an exciting 4 hours of connecting different components together and hearing that beep, the sense of accomplishment I got when writing and running my first program came back!




I knew that these were the things I wanted to to in the future. How hardware and software interact with one another and create the wonderfully complex world of computer engineering! I am going to a robotics engineering summer camp next summer and I simply cannot wait!
Now here is my question to you. What do I do next? The world of computer programming/engineering is so unbelievably large that I am quite lost at the moment. What can I do to keep feeding my passion for this topic. Do I just write more programs, tinker with more electronics, or move on to something more difficult and complex. I need your feedback on this matter.

Another thing. My dream is to attend MIT to study my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. This is an extremely far fetched idea but I am trying to do everything possible to improve my already low chances. Another choice of mine is the NYU, Tandon school of Engineering. If anyone has had any past experiences with these types of Universities, can you please also share your views on that matter.

44,I'm a computer engineering student having a difficult time understanding electricity and some of its properties as physical concepts. Could anyone help?,1452882487,"**Preemptive TL;DR**:  I can examine math equations and see how a circuit element is defined to behave, but I can't understand *why*.  I can do node/mesh analysis, but I always get tripped up because I don't have a good, intuitive understanding of voltage, current, KCL, KVL, Ohm's law, Faraday's law, and how they're physically describing what's happening.  I don't know how to approach fixing this understanding.  I need some advice.

---
---

I've had a few classes on circuits now, and my classes are getting more advanced, but I'm still having trouble with stuff that others would consider fundamentals.  It causes me to really have problems understanding how to use nodal analysis, mesh analysis, superposition and others for examining circuits.  

I have a *terrible, terrible* memory, and lots of these courses just throw laws and equations at us that we're expected to remember and know without actually *explaining* anything.  Many times a concept will be introduced and then it's: ""Here's the behavior of this element.  This is the equation we use to describe it.  If we do this and then this to the equation, we get this result.  That's how this element works,"" but I don't actually get any kind of real understanding from that.

I've tried searching for phrases and terms like:

* ""What is resistance/voltage/current?""
* ""What does resistance/voltage/current represent?""
* ""Why do electrons move?""
* ""How do AC currents actually exist?""

But a lot of the explanations I've been finding gloss over things.  They explain a lot of it is: ""Well it is because it is,"" and I have a hard time with that.  It's either that, or they explain it with in-depth mathematical analysis and only show equations, but don't go over what the equations mean during the analysis.  

I've taken up through integral calculus, and *just* passed an intro to differential equations course by the skin of my teeth, so I can understand a little bit to most of the math involved in deeper examinations, but I still have a hard time really *intuitively understanding* those results.

I mean, I can accept a law because of the mathematical proof.  But I guess I'm just having a hard time actually conceptualizing it.  Little terms like saying ""across"" when talking about voltage throw me off.  My brain hears ""through"" even though I know it's wrong.  I have to tell myself explicitly ""They mean looking at that point from this one, the other point has 12 V of potential"" or something.  Then thinking about how that potential can be positive or negative.  Then why do we subtract voltages when doing node analysis?  I mean, I know *how and when* to do something like that, but I still don't get *why*.

I know that current is like water flow, voltage is like holding something up off of the earth, and resistance/conductance is basically how difficult/easy it is for electricity to flow through something.

I guess I'm having a hard time with ""why?"" or something.  *Why* do electrons move at all?  I'm sure it has something to do with fields, but I don't even quite understand how fields themselves exist.  What *is* a field?  There is a lot of hand waving.  I know that's needed to just get through stuff without spending an eternity learning about it, but it's kind of necessary for how I learn stuff.  I just don't *get* stuff, unless I know *why*.

I'm taking a physics course right now and it's somewhat explaining these ideas, but they're geared more toward the general body of students because they're general education physics courses.  But it doesn't go any further than ""fields exist"".  Maybe I'm just thinking too hard?  Maybe I should find some kind of ""history of electricity and how shit was discovered"" series of books or videos.

Has anyone else had this problem?  Is there a really good book or bunch of videos that really explain what electricity is and how it works?   I'm not sure how to even approach this.

-  I take a long time to solve problems because I tend to want to look too deeply into the issue. Eg. An enclosure falls off the side of a machine because a screw is stripped.

Use longer screws and probably remark that there might be engineers who do not understand the basics of fasteners. A more efficient engineer would just add more screws and be done with issuing the necessary changes in an hour. My method would take 2 days.
- I tend to get caught up in the theory behind a problem, the underlying principles etc, As one manager once put it, I tend to go in circles instead of going in a straight path.

My question follows thusly: does anyone know common practices for moving them? Perhaps the usual methods employed by navy engineers in WWII or even modern methods or bizarre means that are ambiguously practical--anything would be helpful. 

I figure a crane, 4 lift points welded to the hut, and a really long custom semi trailer would do the trick...but we don't have a crane and want to minimize costs on the move.",AskEngineers,Decafon,/r/AskEngineers/comments/41461g/does_anyone_know_how_to_effectively_movetransport/

Given this list, potential clients might see this contract house more favorably than another which might have just a bunch of engineer B's.

Edit 1.5: After looking at the diagram that was in the data sheet I figure I can use a 555 timer, like that up with a transformer to bump up the voltage and a rectifier is a really simple circuit to make (4 diodes) all in all, I think I can make it pretty cheep.

Im about to start studying Marine Engineering and i kinda like doing the math on the computer so im torn between these two softwares.

There is going to be alot of eletrical and automation calculation during my degree.

So which one of these software do you guys prefer?

One of the things im fallen in love with is the ability to ""just"" change the values and it will ""calculate"" the entire thing insted of typing it all down on my HP 50g.

Im sorry if this question have been raised before.

- Best wishes.",AskEngineers,Mrammonia,/r/AskEngineers/comments/40snq8/mathcad_prime_31_maple_2015_or_excel_2016/
