1,Evaporative cooling. Heat from air or water?,1435663287,"Greetings. Consider a pool of water which has hot air blown over it. A few things happen:

1) Heat is transferred from the hot air to the cooler water.

2)Some evaportation occurs.

3)The latent heat used causes cooling.

My question is, where does the energy come from to cause evaporation? From the heated water or from the hot air?

Which fluid will cool due to evaporation? The water? The air? Both?

3,Question for an industrial project/Hydraulic system not working.,1435652576,"http://imgur.com/J3XNO7q
http://imgur.com/KCa3Ko6
Hi. For an industrial project i was asked to design a hydraulic system that would get the job done, which was to move the lever attached to the output cylider to the left as shown in the images below. This fails to work though. Apparently pushing the piston of input cylinder is impossible when it is filled with hydraulic oil. A reason suggested for this is that the pipe dia connecting the two cylinders is too small for oil to pass through since the pipe is used for pneumatics, while some say hydraulic oil can never be forced in such a way and always require pumps.
The question is why isnt the system working and what can i do to make it work?",AskEngineers,imiimmad,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3blzpg/question_for_an_industrial_projecthydraulic/

5,How would V2G use wear down EV batteries?,1435646669,"EE (power systems) student here. I've been reading on energy storages effect on the power grid and EV's (Electric Vehicles) are pretty damn interesting in that regard. V2G (Vehicle to Grid) capabilities could bring  much needed flexibility to the power system when unpredictable wind and solar production become more and more prevalent.

My question(s) concerns the battery technologies that these IEEE papers did not touch on. Would the added charging and discharging from V2G severely reduce battery life time in EV's? Can this be reduced with specific charging patterns? If battery swapping becomes the norm, with the right tariff, could V2G still be profitable for the end user?

11,Concerned Intern,1435621437,"Hey guys,
I graduated from high school last year with a mild interest in engineering and so far the studying portion i have enjoyed and got excellent results (which is required to keep the internship). I applied for an internship that lasts the entirety of my Uni course and managed to acquire it. I made sure to inform them I had no prior experience at all but was willing to learn and they said that was expected. Throughout my first semester i was given tasks that I had no idea how to complete i.e. this is a manufacturing company and I was asked to design and build a testing jig for some microswitches. Obviously, the entire time I had no idea what I was doing because I've had minimum experience designing circuits and even using tools. I wasn't able to start for along time because i was working out a circuit and eventually someone just gave me one and told me to make it. However, i didn't even know what soldering was at the time so it took more time and things like this kept happening. I've just finished first semester (which is an open semester so it doesn't focus solely on your major and theg give you a taste of everything). They're asking me to look at schematics and repair things that I really don't understand. When I ask a question I always get the impression that I'm bothering them and that I shouldn't be. Just wondering how I should go about this whether yous have any advice. I've asked other interns and they just tell me that the company usually throws you in the deep end and that i should just learn from that but I'm more of a visual learner (if i see someone else do it I can pick up on it much quicker.)

12,How do you account for a constant in a state-space equation?,1435620732,"I'm trying to get my system physics model into state-space form so that I can build an LQR controller for it. From what I understand this should look something like:

dx/dt = Ax + Bu

Where x is a vector of state variables, dx/dt is their derivatives, and u is a vector of inputs. A and B have to be constant matrices.

The problem is that I have some constants in my system which makes it not fit into this form in an obvious way. In my case these constants came from the gravity term from trying to linearize the system to fit in this form.

As an simple example, lets say the system is dx/dt = sin(x) + 2u, and I want to linearize about the point where x = pi/4. Doing this I get:

dx/dt = cos(pi/4)x + sin(pi/4)-cos(pi/4)(pi/4) + 2u

Simplifying it becomes roughly:

dx/dt = 0.7x + 0.15 + 2u

So my A matrix would be [0.7] and my B matrix would be [2], but what do I do with the 0.15?

17,[ASK] Questions about colour-blind and advice for taking major,1435596416,"Hello enginers.I am a student with colour blind (only partial-color blind though). 
I have been interested in some fields like chemical engineering.However,many informations I had searched said that my color blind will impact the success of my employment by some companies,also that my works and study will get lots of difficulties.Even quite many of universities in my hometown restrict students with colorblind to go to chem.engineering.
 Can you share your opinion about this?Is partial color-blind a deal-breaker for chemical engineering,materials,or biomedical?

Oh by the way I also want to ask you an advice in choosing my major.
Civil,mechanical,biomedical; there are many good opts .However,i feel really confused now.

Some adviced me to take the degree that I would really like to take (because it will be the thing we learn until we get old).They said that we should not matter whether we will easily get a job or not,because if we love what we studied,we would strive for the best.

Some however,said that the things we like always change,and its better to take the safe and easy-in-getting job like mechanical or chemical engineering,also arguing that better we take the broad-discipline engineering first for undergraduate (like :electrical,mechanical),then continue getting graduate degree in specialised-discipline (system engineering,biomedical) because usually the latter degree won't be appreciated well if it's only bachelor degree. 
Can you give me advice about this? 

In the end ,thank you for your attention,engineers.Have a good day :)

Hi
 
I am writing on behalf of my friend John. He has recently purchased his first home (in London – so he’s pretty much not eaten for a decade). He’s just got engaged and is trying to get his career as a cartoonist started... he’s a nice guy etc
 
Anyway, there appears to be an issue with his new house. It’s next to an Evangelical Church and they have 3am services at the weekend. Services that are loud and clappy and happy and audible in his house.
 
I live in Australia around Sunday lunch, I start to see rants from him on FAcebook about calling the police and being up and in a rage all night.
 
There was a bit of discussion about playing Black Sabbath, Motorhead or something very metal back through the walls. I’m now thinking that this is the wrong approach.
 
A combination of Deep Space Nine (Sisko talking about phase inverters) and a Motorhead (edit: iron maiden) joke about 667 being the neighbour of the beast, has led me to an idea, but I have no idea if it is possible – or whether the feedback would be a problem.
 
Is it possible to record the sound coming through the wall and then play it back as loud but with a one second lag, or someway shifted to sound discordant with the original?
 
This would solve a couple of problems. When the Police turn up, John would not be playing music - he would be echoing it, and also, and there’s probably something in the Bible about this, he would have the moral high ground as he was reflecting back their own sounds. Any biblical quotes that help here?
 
Anyway, I think the feedback would be an issue and it needs smarter people to work out the solution.
 
I am happy to cover a few hundred dollars of the solution as an engagement present to John and a f you to the people next door.

I would be incredibly grateful for any advice, but probably not quite as grateful as John and his soon-to-be wife.

Have a weld in it or is it good for [telescoping](http://i.imgur.com/oedmLPD.jpg) with ?


------------------------

(In my [last post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3aux1o/1220_screw_thread_pushing_up_250_lbs_table_how/) I asked about the mechanism to raise and lower the table. I'm still waiting on some prices but I will prefer ACME threaded rod 1/2"" 10 TPI over normal screw 1/2""-20.)

For the legs, I want to use two square tubes, one inside the other as a guide. The inner tube will come out of the leg to change table height.

The problem I have is that some tube have a weld on the inside and that will probably mess with the action I'm trying to make.

I'm having a hard time finding how big of a bump this weld is.

At the metal place I can order from, there seem to be two square tubing 2""x2""x1/8"" that would be good for table legs.

They are at page 53 of the [linked pdf](http://www.russelmetals.com/en/Products/Documents/William_Bachcall_Russel_Stock%20List.pdf)

There aren't any picture and it doesn't specify what the difference is. I suppose one of them is made without a weld and the other with a weld ?

How big is the weld inside the tube ?

I suppose the structural steel tube is more expensive by a lot so I figure if I take a small size and weld flat bar inside the leg it will be just as good with the cheaper stuff ?

Like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/N6qP5es.jpg)

------------------------------------------

My table has a target weight of 250 lbs and I'm hoping to keep the torque to raise it under 50 inch pounds (so I can drive them with car seat motors). Will these two configuration of telescoping leg have a significant difference in friction ?

-------------------------------------------

What kind of lubrication would work well for that kind of job ? I'm thinking of using [nickel-based anti-seize](http://www.amazon.com/Permatex-77124-Nickel-Anti-Seize-Lubricant/dp/B0002UENJ2) compound, re-applied yearly or maybe [something with molybdenum](http://www.amazon.com/Dow-Corning-Molykote-Grease-Lubricant/dp/B008ZGBXRU/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435457235&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=molycote) in it.

65,Question about high power signal generation,1435368255,"Hey guys! I was hoping to do some experimentation with [ultrasonic welding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_welding) and was shopping around online for a power supply that would output a 20kHz sine wave (with tuning for +/-200 Hz) with 0.5-1kW of power. Unfortunately I wasn't really able to find anything within my current budget (under $1000). So I decided to look into building my own.

I was thinking of purchasing a laboratory signal generator, since I'd be able to tune to the exact frequency I'd need with reasonably low noise and high mobility (as opposed to using my PC to generate a signal). Then I was thinking of purchasing a high wattage amplifier and feeding the signal through there. But this ends up raising quite a few questions.

First, are there good sine wave generators that would output a 20kHz signal? I'm a mechanical engineer and have never use, let alone buy, signal generators since my mechatronics lab class in college, so I know relatively little about this and have almost no idea what I'm looking at when I read specs for signal generators.

Second, can I use any amplifier, or does the amplifier need to be designed for a specific frequency range? There are some very attractively priced amplifiers out there, [but they're marketed as ""subwoofer amps""](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_975MA10FX/MATCH-MA10FX.html?tp=115&amp;awkw=75647442505&amp;awat=pla&amp;awnw=g&amp;awcr=47742358345&amp;awdv=c). Looking at the ""details"" tab for that amplifier shows that the ""Low-Pass Crossover Frequency"" for the amp is 30-250Hz. That's literally 100 times lower than what I'm looking for. I take it if I pass a 20kHz signal through this amp, then I will see no actual amplification of the signal. If that's the case, can the circuitry of an amp like this be modified (granted a person has enough schooling a training) to accomodate a higher frequency or do amplifiers in this price range rely on op-amps and digital circuitry to amplify signals?

Third, and probably most practical, what don't I know? I searched for various keywords that amounted to ""ultrasonic welding power supplies"". I did so because I knew for a fact that this is a well established application for (relatively) high powered A/C signals in the ultrasonic frequency range. But what other applications require a 20kHz sine wave that carries 500 W of power?

82,"Best non marring, material to use as ""rubber"" on ab exercise roller?",1435279684,"Hi all,

I could use some suggestions as to the best material to use for a new ab roller wheel contact thread. Material needs to be durable on various surfaces (home, gym, wood, carpet, etc) and not slippery when used on smooth surfaces. It also needs to be rigid and maintain it's shape when weight it applied. Most importantly it needs to not mar the surface such as wood floors. 

Thanks in advance!

I need to design something for my Solidworks class and I don't want to look like an idiot in front of the class by presenting a design that clearly won't work.
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
The design is basically a wiper blade that is spun by an electric motor and has a lever to move it in an out of position. I have some ideas for curved blades that I believe would help move water off of the windshield if this were an actual system. If this system could work I would be interested in building one in the future, but for now I'm just interested in modeling it.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Some guesses as to why this can't work/doesn't exist are: electric motor is too big, wouldn't perform as well as a tradition wiper system, would fail in a short time period, and cost.

91,What happens when you spin a Hydraulic Gear Pump below minimum RPM spec?,1435245244,"I have an application in which I need a hydraulic pump to spin directly off a shaft turning 420 rpm. Give or take 50 rpm, maybe as much as 100 rpm. There is no room for any gear or belt overdrives (mobile application).

I'm looking at a gear motor that has a min RPM spec of 400 rpm and a max RPM spec of 3000 RPM. What happens when I get close or lower than the minimum RPM spec? Besides pumping less fluid. Does the pump start pulsating?

The pump directly drives a small orbit motor. There is an inline filter, reservoir, and pressure relief valve (in case the motor stalls) but no kind of valving. Speed of the orbit motor is set by engine RPM. I can oversize the pump and add a flow divider but that doesn't change the 420 shaft speed I have to work with.

I recently got a call from my building manager regarding the tenant below me complaining about the noise keeping him up.

Needless to say, I will be turning off the unit at night until a more permanent solution presents itself. In the meantime during the day I have placed the unit on top of some firm sleeping mats (ie: 2 firm one inch thick camping sleep mats).

I'm looking to build a small pad of material to rest on the floor with the unit on top of it in hopes of dampening the sound enough that it will not bother the tenant below.

26,How do you manage sourcing materials and components from suppliers that won't tell you what they sell?,1435099461,"I'm really annoyed by a longstanding problem that seems common specifically with the metal distribution industry, at least in my area. There are some small metal shops in town, and none of them publish a list of what they sell, despite their selection effectively never changing.

This wouldn't be so much of a problem for materials I can purchase there; I can just go in and browse their shelves and see what they offer, except it's annoying not having a summary including prices for standard lengths.

Unfortunately though, there is no source in my city for angle and tubing in aluminum alloys like 6061 and 7075, which I use frequently. The only quasi-local source is a company called [Trident Metals](http://www.trident-metals.com) (they're elsewhere in the state but make daily delivery runs and so their delivery charge is very reasonable).  As you can see from the site, there's no actual list of stocked profiles that they carry, and they have nothing like that to offer when I ask on the phone. So every time I call (every few months or so), I have to waste nontrivial time on the phone going over what they sell and what the prices are, which is usually goes something like:

""Do you have __ by __ ?""

""Yes.""

""Ok, do you have __ by __?""

""No.""

""Then do you have __ by __?""

""No.""

""Can you tell me what dimensions you carry in this alloy?""

""Well what are you looking for?""

...during which I'm invariably made to feel like I'm a hassle they'd rather not deal with.  I'm trying to come up with a reasonable design, and part of my criteria is *what's available for a reasonable price*. I would be a much better and more frequent customer of theirs if I could just read that off of a web page or a reasonably up-to-date catalog page.

I could go with Online Metals, Metals Supermarket or some other web-based dealer that actually has their IT shit together, but the prices are so (vastly!) much higher even before shipping, it's difficult to justify.

How does any retail industry survive, which refuses to openly list and describe what they sell? And what do engineers do when trying to evaluate design choices based on the availability and cost of various stock materials, when this information is such a pain to acquire?

Why is this so hard? How is this normally handled?

27,"Why go into bioengineering, with software development more lucrative?",1435096199,"I have a variety of interests. I am of course interested in making an impact. I am a soon-to-be graduate of a good university, with a degree in Biophysics and a Minor in bioinfomatics. I've realized recently that for me, money is a bigger motivator than scientific discovery, and while I like academia, I (think) I prefer entrepreneurship. This is why I see myself working in industry. Starting out somewhere, and eventually starting a company.

That being said, I prefer to work in the biotech industry. Previously my plan was to go to grad school (PhD in Bioengineering), focusing on synthetic biology, and work in industry producing pramacueticals/materials. As far as I understand, to be in a high position in the industry I am interested in, a graduate degree is almost necessary.

 However, I have a very strong background in programming/software development, and an alternative career choice is to work in the health/biotech industry as a programmer, and working with the biotech industry through software development, perhaps in bioinformatics.

My delimma is this. I like the idea of getting a PhD, but I'm not sure if I can justify that decision. I can start as a developer right away making $90,000+, $140,000 in several years, get sweat equity right away, and found a company in 5 years. Or I could go for a PhD, spend ~5 years on a barely sufficient salary, and then when I finish, based on the research I've done, my salary will be roughly equivalent to an entry-level position in software development (90K). But of course, at that point I'm 5 years behind.

And Academia compares even worse. post-doc researchers get paid very little. Associate professors get paid very little. Tenured Professors have good salaries and good jobs, but by the time I could get there I figure I would be 40.

Of course the Market is not fair. I just want to know if any of you think they can justify the PhD route. Are there anyways in which this is better? Is my comparison fair?

32,"1/2""-20 Screw thread pushing up 250 lbs table, how much torque ?",1435084265,"Hi,

I'm building a big welding table and I need it to be height adjustable.

I'm going to have a threaded rod of 1/2"" diameter and 20 turns per inch to push up the table. I want to use car seat motors to turn this threaded rod but I want to figure out how much torque I will need.

The table weight 250 lbs, so I'm going to assume it's pushing 125 lbs.

The mechanical advantage of the screw (I think) is 2*pi/(1/20)=~ 125:1

Lubricated screw threads are said to be usually about 10% efficient so 12.5:1

So 125lbs / 12.5 = 10 inch pounds of torque ? This sounds kind of low, am I calculating this correctly ?

46,"Civil / Electrical Engineers - What are your thoughts on a deep buried (via TBM), superconducting, system of high voltage lines?",1435027762,"With right-of-ways becoming more difficult and expensive to procure, is the future of high voltage transmission underground? What elements would a well-designed system have? What diameter would the tunnel likely need to be for construction/maintenance? What benefits/challenges would it cost vs. overhead transmission lines? I haven't been able to find any good sources for information, but I have a few thoughts. 

The mean tunnel depth would likely have to be at least 20m deep to avoid accidental disturbances, and also would make it difficult for most cases of intentional disruption (terrorism). Maintenance/access facilities would be located every 10 miles or so and include deep cylindrical wells to collect any water that might bleed into the system, and it would have pumps to vacate said water (tunnels would drain slightly towards the nearest pump/mx station). I'm not sure of diameter requirements as there is much dependent on the cooling system. It would also be prudent to build for expansion as the up-front capital would be small in comparison to drilling another set of tunnels. If I were to wager a guess, a 2.5m diameter tunnel would allow enough space for equipment, maintainers and expansion. Although the cost would be ludicrously high, the builder could also rent out the tunnel for other non-dangerous purposes such as fiberoptic use. 

The benefits would include higher transmission efficiency, aesthetic benefits (fewer big towers and lines), wildlife benefits (UV arcing), the line itself would be immune to solar/electromagnetic threats, the company could sell off it's RoW for capital (if not also used by gas lines), in most places a right of way wouldn't need to be purchased - especially if Congress made a concession for eminent domain, more power can be pushed through a lower cross-section of material, easier troubleshooting/repairs, potentially able to last hundreds of years. 

The cons would obviously be primarily cost/initial investment, engineering difficulties (drilling near/through aquifers, undergroud RoW), maintenance and overhead would be somewhat high depending on method and level of redundancy for cooling used, if cooling system failed there could be a catastrophic failure, not likely feasible in areas of seismic instability.

I think that this will likely be a cornerstone of the smart-grid in the future, I am curious as to just how far into the future this idea is?

69,"What actually is bend deduction and bend allowance? Several conflicting definitions heard, wanting clarification.",1434884619,"Sheet metal, such as a 2mm thick sheet of 430 stainless steel alloy, increases in length when bent. This expansion of the material occurs only along each bend, while all unbended sections are unaffected.

Because sheet metal expands at each bend, the design of a bent part will always be longer than the design of the 2D sheet metal blank (""flat pattern""), with which the sheet metal will be accurately cut/stamped/etc before the actual bending takes place. For example, a bent part design with a total length of 100cm could have a flat pattern length of 95cm that will stretch to 100cm during manufacturing along a series of bends.

The bend deduction and bend allowance are simply words that refer to particular numbers in a sheet metal bend diagram that helps the designer figure out how much length they exactly have to deduct from the final (bent) design in order to arrive at the 2D design (flat pattern).

Internet sources have been inconsistent with the definitions for these terms. I'd appreciate clarification, ideally with references to clear concepts like the length of the neutral axis.

EDIT: My current understanding is that, in order to get the length between the flat pattern's bend-line and one end of the sheet, you take the final design's respective flange length minus half of the bend deduction. 

To get the width of the bend on the flat pattern, I believe you take the sum of the final design's unbent lengths, minus the length of the flat pattern.",AskEngineers,openyk,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3alh2i/what_actually_is_bend_deduction_and_bend/

73,Fair salary for this position? (Profile plastic extrusion tool and die design),1434852876,"Hello everyone. I’m not sure if this is the best sub for this question so please let me know if there is a better one.  Also I am using an anon account for various reasons.  I have debated for a long time about posting here (or anywhere) about this subject. One of the issues is that I am not even sure what my job title should be.  I have searched over the years trying to find similar jobs, but I have only ever found a few that looked close, and rarely do you find a salary for reference.

&amp;nbsp;

So to start, forgive me that this is pretty long!

&amp;nbsp;

My job is to design and oversee the construction and development of plastic extrusion tooling (from the customers desired part drawing on my desk, to a finished production ready tool on our companies extruders) which is then used in the same facility for part production and shipping purposes.

&amp;nbsp;

The tooling we build is designed for a great number of materials.  Primarily PVC (rigid and flexible) PPX/PPE (Noryl), TPR / TPE, urethane, nylon, and others.

&amp;nbsp;

Profiles are of virtually anything our customers can imagine. From simple ID / OD tubes, gaskets of nearly any kind, electrical busways, industrial expansion joints (bridges, buildings etc), railway liners / seals, trim and panels of various types, all of these in vastly different sizes from small 1/8” to 15”+ wide / tall extrusions with wall thickness from .025"" to 1"" or more thick.   In addition to this many of these dies are dual or triple durometers (combining 2 or more materials in the same die, for instance imagine a rigid clip with an integrated flexible seal surface), and some are crosshead type dies (allowing us to insert metals or string / cable inside of a profile as it is extruded).

&amp;nbsp;

Many of these profiles are extremely complex to balance for flow because of greatly varied wall thicknesses. Generally extrusion profiles are designed to have a typical wall thickness for ease of die design and development.  However many of our customers demand profiles that have walls which can vary from .05” to .200” for thin wall, to .25” to 1” for thicker wall in numerous places throughout the same profile. This equates to extreme pressure and velocity differences with unpredictable crossflow in the dies.  

&amp;nbsp;

This all requires a great amount of knowledge for each material type, how they flow, how they cool, and what the expected production rates are which all dictate the die and sizer (or calibrator) design.  Materials like urethane for instance run more like water which requires very precise flow balancing, while something like TPE (rubber like material) is more claylike as it is extruded and much easier to work with.  In other words a die designed for a PVC part is vastly different from one designed to run an identical part in PPX material.  

&amp;nbsp;

This tooling also has to be designed in a way that the dies and sizers can be built with our existing tooling (mills, surface grinders, lathes, wire EDMs, etc) Basically the optimal way to design tooling is not always physically possible due to the constraints of our machinery. There also has to be enough foresight that we can later use mills and hand tools to remove die material for flow balancing in the dies, or cooling and or vacuum in the sizers.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s nearly impossible to balance most dies without setting them up and running them through experimental trials, then making modifications.  This expected feed work is usually thought out in the early design phase and planned into the die so that it is accessible to our tooling (dies tend to have very narrow, and very deep internal channels), and so that in the worst cases enough die material is left that the die is still structurally sound (pressures inside the die can reach to many thousand PSI).  We have had a couple of dies destroy themselves because the desired part geometry left very little strength to the die and internal pressures distorted them beyond repair.

&amp;nbsp;

On top of the design work which boils down to a lot of math to set baselines and educated guessing from experience to determine pressure and velocity changes (both on paper, and using Solidworks) I also prepare and print all the design documents for the machine shop, I prepare all of the NC code for the wire EDM’s (using a very old DOS based cad/cam package which I setup Dosbox to run), I maintain and operate both EDM’s (everything from basic routine maintenance, to in-depth board and mechanical diagnostics, and all tooling setups and part indication, as well as attending to the cutting procedures. 

&amp;nbsp;

Our shop is also severely understaffed currently (only 3 tool and die makers) myself, and 2 of which are very often doing trial runs on new tooling or repairing existing dies, one of which is also retiring very soon. So many times I am also preparing my own stock (I can use Bridgeports, lathes, surface grinders, etc). I am also often drawing customer parts coming in for quotes just so that our sales team can get accurate material volumes (co-workers have very limited cad and or area figuring skills). 

&amp;nbsp;

I am also in charge of researching and ordering all necessary tooling stock (plate, bar stock in various stainless, cold / hot roll, aluminum, as well as all necessary wire EDM supplies.  Tooling stock can cost anywhere from 100$ to 20,000$ for some of the larger dies and sizing equipment we build.

&amp;nbsp;

Besides extrusion tooling, I am also pretty familiar with injection molding, both in part, and mold design. One of my recent projects was designing a fairly large custom flow mold (the first ever for our company) that was mounted directly to an extruder for a roughly 5lb part. I also designed the part itself to meet the criteria our sales team needed, and have been helping to troubleshoot and streamline the processing aspect (1 part every hour to a part every 7-8 minutes) . This tool easily cost 1/15 to 1/20 the cost of a proper injection mold (we needed 2 molds, mirror image of the same part) which we would have had to have built outside, not to mention being built outside would not meet our time constraints.

&amp;nbsp;

To my knowledge there are very few resources available to teach die design.  However I was lucky to work with and learn everything I could over 6-7 years from my late father whom had grown with the industry for 30+ years and designed and developed roughly 1800 dies himself in that time. Besides what I learned from my father, I have also spent a great deal of my own free time learning as much as I can about materials and tooling design.

&amp;nbsp;

When he died (almost 2 years ago) I transitioned seamlessly from following his design instruction (I previously designed the dies to his specifications on CAD and operated the wire EDMs), to making all of the big decisions and performing all of the major design work myself.  I have virtually no one to fully back me up, or double check the work I do in every specific detail, however I work very closely with my 2 fellow tool and die guys who do aid me in finding basic mistakes, or offering sound suggestions when I run into debatable design choices.  The shop is extremely high paced, sometimes we are juggling 4-5 jobs at once, and the 3 of us are great team players and watch each others backs.

&amp;nbsp;

To my knowledge this is an extremely specialized field, with very few teaching resources or accessible knowledge (between years of random google searches, and hundreds of $ worth of books, I have only found very basic die design information).

&amp;nbsp;

A few additional details, our company has no one else that I can honestly see filling the position I am in currently.  One of my fellow tool and die guys (only with the company less than a year) does have die design experience from his previous job, however it is for rubber (similar to TPE in tooling design, and considered “easy” to work with).  He also has very limited Solidworks skills at this time, and limited on what he can do with the wire EDMs (I am teaching him as much as I can, but our time together is extremely limited). In time I think he could definitely do everything I do, however I think that would take at least a full year of directly working with and learning from me. And even then, I don't think he will have near the knowledge of all of our existing tooling as I do which often requires maintenance, or reworked as specific raw plastic materials sometimes become unavailable and replaced with other similar materials (and different flow characteristics).

&amp;nbsp;

Besides him, our company does not have anyone with cad skills (that I have seen) sufficient enough to even replicate another person’s part print (not anything moderately complex at least), let alone go through the detail to design a die assuming they knew how to, or are told how to design one in the first place.  The company is pretty successful, with about 40-50 employees, and revenue around 15-20 million a year to my understanding.  We are currently backlogged in our tooling department by about 4 months, with new request coming in almost daily (some tooling takes anywhere from a day to 2-3+ weeks to design and build, not including the extrusion development time)

&amp;nbsp;

Over the last 2 years I have designed and oversaw the building of about 100 new dies and sizers (including some misc splicing molds and other random tooling, adapters, custom tables, guide systems etc), virtually all of which we were able to use to produce good looking parts within our customers tolerance and visual appearance needs (many of which I think my father would have been greatly impressed with).  Some of these parts were actually much more complicated than anything we previously worked with (for the specific material type), and I developed a completely new way of designing the dies for that material as what my father taught me was completely incapable of producing the newer parts we needed.

&amp;nbsp;

The company also does have a new part owner (almost a year now) which has talked to me about increasing pay, especially after spending a little time with me on the weekend seeing what goes into the design phase (my idea), and having multiple people interview with us as helpers to my position, and asking for more starting pay then I make.

&amp;nbsp;

Lately the job has also become a bit frustrating as many of our sales and management are asking how our department is so far behind.  Many of them seem to think designing and building this tooling is taking the customers print, scanning it or drawing it, hitting a few buttons and putting a piece of steel on the EDM.   They also do not realize that our sales department has more than doubled in size, but our tooling department has shrunk by over half (my father dying, and 2 retired, (another retiring soon as I previously mentioned soon leaving us with 2 people)  These are the same people that come to me to figure out areas and volumes on basic shapes so they can quote material cost to customers.  I do know the company has so far unsuccessfully been trying to find outside sources which will design and or build extrusion tooling for them to help us catch up and to possibly learn new design ideas ourselves.  So far they can only find those that offer to build what we design.

&amp;nbsp;

30 years ago, these dies were built with jig saws and cut out by hand and eye.  And I do not believe the bean counters have ever kept up with how the department has advanced over that time, building more and more complex tools, with tighter and tighter tolerances using more and more complex software and machinery to do so, I just don’t think the pay scale has kept up with it at all to be honest, especially considering how specialized a field it is..

&amp;nbsp;

Now I really enjoy my job a lot, it’s the first job I have worked that I was not bored out of my mind at after a year or less.  I do have some nice perks working there as well, most of my coworkers I get along with very well, I love the work, and I am generally allowed to work the hours that I want to and I usually do not have anyone looking over my shoulder, and having a machine shop available to you is a massive bonus, I can also do overtime cad/design work from home at anytime I can squeeze it in without burning myself out.  However I feel the pay is very low for what I am doing which is currently 17.50/hr (bumped up from 15/hr shortly after my father died, and previously 10.50/hr for the first 4-5 years I worked there).

&amp;nbsp;

My father told me he only ever had 2 or 3 raises in the 30+ years he worked there, (I believe he was only making slightly more than I am now) which is disturbing considering how much the company grew over those 30 years on the tooling he designed for the company.

&amp;nbsp;

So if anyone has made it this far, thank you for reading, and hopefully you might have some insight into what a fair pay might be for this position?  I feel I have good reason to negotiate, however, I also feel my job opportunities in this specific field are very limited, so moving to another company is probably very unlikely.

I have to constrain a plate to linear motion in the z (up and down) direction. If we're looking at an x y plane, there is a force down applied at (0,0) in the negative z direction, and there is a positive z force applied at (0,10). My idea was to constrain the motion with two parallel shafts with bronze sleeve bearings at some (+-x,y) to restrict this motion.  I only push using the sleeve bearings because they are relatively cheap compared to linear ball bearings, linear sleeve bearings, and rail systems, and I am only trying to put a ""Frankenstein"" assembly together before I delve deep.

My questions:

How can I approach this to maximize the chance I have at preventing the system from binding?
What method, when I move to a more refined iteration, should I pursue- Linear ball bearings, Rails, linear sleeve bearings, or some other method?

I'm new here, but read the FAQ and think this is relevant because it has to do with my future resume and CV.


Basically, I graduated from college with a dual major in the humanities. It hasn't translated into a job *at all* in the two years I had them. I'm 25 now, and am looking at going back into a more profitable STEM discipline. I'm very serious about enrolling in Penn State's Electrical Engineering program. 

The issue is that I only have credits for algebra. I've been accepted as a ""Pre-Major"" student, but I'll have to get up to Calculus III, Physics, and Chemistry before I'm able to be admitted into the major proper. Assuming that I pass every class as its scheduled, I feel like I should be able to get these pre-major requirements in a year. 


My question is whether or not you think this is worth it? I'm 25 now and, while I've always had a major interest in building and designing things, I might wind up not even leaving this bachelor's degree program until I'm like 30.

So, here's my situation. My friend has a spine condition called Scoliosis. In addition to this, she also has problems with her thyroid. These shared problems causes my friend, who we shall call Billy-Joel, for privacy reasons, to be bed-ridden most of the time out of pain.

As you can expect, this has very negative effects on her brain. Most days, she's depressed, and can't do much of anything. Other days, she's frustrated, and quick to 'bite' so to say.

I think the main cause is the fact that while she's bedridden, shes out of the loop of a lot of our activities. She can't draw, she can't talk on the Skype, and since she's so tired most of the time, she sleeps through a lot of our gatherings.

So, in comes Arkon, who's empathy meter is too damn high. I'd like to try to fabricate a chair for her, set at an angle to support her spine, with a retractable desk, for drawing, and an overhead tv/monitor for the Skype conversations/more drawing.

I planned on adding a lot more things, like a few massage balls in the seat, or heated pads, but my main problem right now is making the base chair.

At the moment, my design is sort of like a futon set in a half circle. The seat I wanted was going to raise the legs a bit to help circulation, and angle the back to about 135 degrees.

For the monitor, I wanted to use two wooden half circles, that support the chair as well.

I need to place a battery still, which I think I'll hide under the chair, and try to keep the thing as lightweight as possible, so myself and another friend can install/move it if needed.

Sorry if this whole thing doesn't make any sense. The idea is still very fluid in my mind, but the closest thing I can find to the chair is here: http://blog.sethroberts.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/office-chair-of-the-future1.jpg

So I’m looking for a resource (textbook, website, etc.) that can help me with more like a heuristic approach to estimating process equipment costs (pumps, agitators, tanks, various instruments, etc.).


I have rate sheets for the contractors I typically use so generating labor costs isn’t terribly difficult. But it’s the equipment and material costs that can be stumping. Especially since I’ve recently changed industries from where everything was totally Class 1 Div 1 explosion proof, heavy corrosion resistant, etc. where costs for something simple could have thousands of dollars over something that doesn’t need the process demands. And now the industry I’m in is using as general purpose as you can get, so I’m now on the other end of the spectrum and left without a baseline from other projects.


And for some additional background, I’m a chemical engineer in manufacturing in the US, been out in industry for about 4 years. In a position now where I’m pretty much the only technical resource and I have to be the expert.


Thanks in advance and any help is appreciated!

46,Rewinder speed problem.,1434544989,"I've been dealing with a problem with one of our rewinders for awhile with no luck, so I figured I'd ask you guys.  We have a rewinder with two spindles winding paper one at a time.  When the line reaches 170+ ft/min, only one of the spindles will be able to complete a splice.  The other one causes too much sag in the paper and fails to pick up the slack.  As if the speed is capped and cannot go any higher.  The system is controlled by a SLC 500 and two Allen-Bradley 1336 Impact drives.  I checked the PID controls for both spindles and they are identical.  We also tried to switch out the drives in case one of those were the issue, but we had the same result.  One thing I noticed while watching the motor amperage on the drive display, the malfunctioning spindle would show around 3-4 amps higher than the other spindle drive while attempting to speed up to the line speed.  Does anyone have an idea of what could be causing this?   ",AskEngineers,Styleaux,/r/AskEngineers/comments/3a5o27/rewinder_speed_problem/

53,How to calculate spring rotation during compression,1434513802,"Hello all,

I work with regulators and one of the units i'm helping with has an issue with the spring buckling and rubbing against the spring casing. During actuation, the measuring element sees inlet pressure and the spring provides the returning force to control the orifice plug position and thus control outlet pressure. 

I believe adding a thrust bearing on the spring seat would allow any rotation of the spring during actuation to be relieved. however, i must mathematically/theoretically prove the force that is actually the rotation of the spring from compression. 

How would i actually calculate the amount of expected rotation of a spring per unit of compression?

61,"Building a mechanical spring-loaded contraption to expand something, not sure how to reverse the motion.",1434495479,"Sorry if that is a little vague, I wasn't quite sure how to explain it concisely enough for a title. *Warning in advance, I don't have any mechanical engineering training/education, so forgive me if something sounds stupid.*

I've always wanted to build a spring loaded contraption that could deploy something and then later retract it. Think [Assassin's creed wrist blade thing](http://24.media.tumblr.com/440fe7d1806693f71184c5219f0f7ca5/tumblr_mhx3780Jb71rylak5o1_1280.jpg), or the [arm holster from Taxi Driver](http://www.everydaynodaysoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Taxi-Driver-Movie-Sleeve-Gun.jpg). Now I'm just using those as examples, my project does not involve either of those things, or anything weapon related for that matter.

The problem I've always encountered when looking at designs of things like this is that while the spring mechanism can cause something to move in one direction, it cannot easily move it back in the opposite direction. Continuing with the above mentioned examples: every device I've seen people build only has one action, to deploy whatever it is that the spring is pushing out. In order to reset the device to its original ""loaded"" position requires manually resetting. The people who build those Assassin's creed knife things always have to use their hands to manually push the blade back into the loaded position.

It's this manual resetting that I want to avoid. 

The problem I see with this (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is that the force required to retract an object must be equal to or greater than the force required to deploy an object. The spring that expands pushes the blade out does not have the ability to pull it back in. (Or conversely, if it was retracting to pull the blade out, it doesn't have the ability to expand again.) You can't put a second spring in the mechanism to push the device back to the original state because it would have to be more powerful than the first spring that expands the device. (And if that was the case, the device wouldn't be able to expand)

For the longest time I thought this was hopeless, then I realized my umbrella expands with one button and contracts with the same button! I found [the patent](http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20110132416) for such a device, but it looks like the 2 springs are working on different parts of the umbrella, so I think I'm still at a loss.

Is this mechanically possible at all, or do the laws of physics not allow it?

I'm thinking perhaps the only way to get something to deploy and then retract again is if I have some electrical device that uses programmed motors to accomplish the movement. (But then that's a whole new world of stuff I've got to figure out just to get something to move a little one way and then move a little back.)

Here's the original question:

-----------------------------

So far we shoveled the dirt off the top of the concrete plug on the bottom of the post and poured water on top to lubricate the concrete. Then we hooked one end of a chain on the base of the post and ran the other end up over a big wedge. We hooked the other end of the chain to a rope and hooked the rope to my car.

When I pull the car forward it puts pressure on the chain, driving the wedge down and pulling the post up. [This is how I see our options](http://imgur.com/a/c8kJS).

a) Lean the wedge against the post at 45 degrees.

b) Lean the wedge against the post at a greater than 45 degree angle (close to 90 degree maybe?).

c) Lean the wedge against the post at a lower than 45 degree angle.

d) Something else?

I have two goals that serve my ultimate goal of getting the post up.

1: I want the post to get pulled as straight vertical as possible. Pulling horizontal puts too much strain on the post and is too hard on my car. I don't want to break either.

2 I want to use the angle that gives me the most power. Those posts are hard to remove. I need all the power I can get.

I was emailing a professor about it and he made it seem like a huge deal that I go to a program that has lots of research projects in my specific part of electrical.  

Is it really that big of a deal?
Like, if I go to a grad program that specializes in Y but has limited X research and plenty of X classes and X is what I want to study, will it still be worth it or is it actually hugely important that I find a program that has a ton of X research?

I have a motorcycle with a custom seat: http://imgur.com/sMjFRxo

The hump on the back contains my battery and wiring. Now I would like to add a rear seat for a passenger, and the simplest way would be a foam block over the fiberglass hump, strapped down to the bike frame. 

While the fiberglass feels strong enough to support a human, I have no reason to assume that is correct. The entire seat pan is made from the fiberglass which I sit on, so I can only assume this would be okay. But I would like some input, since I actually have no idea what I'm talking about.

84,Basic questions from new engineering student to help understand pumps,1434403171,"So I'm studying on my own throughout the summer before taking a few mechanical engineering courses, the biggest one being Naval Engineering: Propulsion and Auxiliary Systems.  At this time, I'm still introducing myself to the basic concepts dealing with valves, pumps, hydraulic systems, etc.

Right now, I'm trying to understand where the lines from a pump curve such as this one are derived from:
http://imgur.com/XJ8EYRV

Assuming that we are working with centrifugal pumps:
I do know that the value for the pump shutoff head (when the rate of flow equals zero for the pump head curve) can be found by closing the discharge valve and measuring the pressure change then, but how is the maximum flow rate found? I'm having trouble understanding how backpressure works and how having no backpressure makes the change of pressure zero.  How is backpressure created? Where is it found?  How does it affect the pump?

Also, how is the system curve derived, and are the intersections between the system curve and the multiple pump head curves the only possible operating points for the pump?

For instance, in this graph:
http://imgur.com/03D5dRr

If the impeller of the pump is 10 inches in diameter and runs at constant speed, does that mean that the pump operates only at the change in pressure and flow rate found at the blue dot labeled ""Operation Point""?

The bracket is the topmost image in the set. It's actually not entirely accurate, I've since redrawn it but I don't have a photo, it's essentially the same though.

The bracket will be a thick hexagonal metal plate with a coupling pipe welded directly in the center, additional coupling connectors will be slotted and then fastened to the plate with bolts. This will allow the struts &amp; beams to slot into the brackets and eventually form the entire structure. Hopefully that description helps explain it.

92,Hanging a rope swing between two tall trees,1434390422,"Hi all,

I recently moved into a home that has two very tall trees (80 feet or so) about 20 feet apart from each other.  Unfortunately neither has a branch suitable for hanging a swing from, so I am trying to figure out the best way to suspend a swing between them.

I'd really like to hang a single rope swing like [this](https://i.imgur.com/7vcarMW.jpg) as high as possible if it can be done safely in a manner where one of my kids won't smack into a tree trunk while in full swing.

The obvious solution would be to just suspend a rope from each tree meeting in the middle in a V sort of formation, with one line continuing down to the swing.  I figured I would put an eye lag or j-lag into each tree and tie the rope to an O ring to hook onto it to prevent wear on the rope.  Alternatively I've considered metal cable between the trees and suspending the rope from that cable in some manner.  From what I've read 1/2 inch polyester rope is a good choice for the rope itsself.

Before I embark on this project, I figured I would see if anyone had any input on how best to accomplish this.  If a single rope swing is too risky due to the tree trunks I'd do a more traditional single seat swing instead.

Would appreciate any input on this, thank you.

**Original Post:**

Hey everyone. It's that time of year again: summer just started, students are graduating and getting accepted into university, and a few of them inevitably wind up here with various questions.

The [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1nqe2w/call_for_engineers_willing_to_be_interviewed/) call for engineers willing to be interviewed is over a year old now, and it's time to refresh it as some people on that list are no longer active, or are simply at a point in life/work where they don't have time to do interviews anymore.

### What am I getting into?

High school students, prospective engineers, and fresh graduates will PM you with interview questions. Usually it's for a class assignment (e.g. 'Intro to Engineering'), so the questions are about work, how you got into engineering, ""do you have any advice for..."", etc. Think of yourself as a STEM Ambassador.

If you look at the old list, I'm at the very top for some reason so I'm usually the first hit for a lot of these, and I get anywhere from 1-4 PMs a month. On a busy month I might get more, and sometimes I don't get any PMs at all.

**This is purely on a volunteer basis**, and you can opt out at any time by deleting your comment here. Once deleted, your contact info will no longer appear on this list.

### How much time does it take?

The first one you do will take about 1 hour (depending on how detailed you are), but after that you can copy-paste answers because many questions are similar. That said, please be sure to read every question carefully before copy-pasting your answers. It's your call on how personal or impersonal you want to be when answering questions.

**If you sign up, please commit to answering at least two interview requests per month**. You don't have to respond to *every* request, but more is better.

### How do I sign up?

Copy the following format and post a top-level comment below. **edit:** fixed formatting of the template, fix yours if you have a minute.

94,Can a metal casting absorb oil if it’s submerged for long periods of time?,1434382155,"Hi everyone! I’ve been a long time lurker on this great subreddit and now I have question that I can’t seem to find a definite answers. (BTW sorry for the grammar English is not my first language)

Before answering my question, let me explain the context. I’ve been working as an intern for the past 2 years a hydropower company. Every now and tend I get a job to rebuild old Babbitt bearings. Those bearings have been in service for at least 10 years and they are always submerged in oil.

Knowing that, when rebuilding the bearing, we ask that the bearing is put in an oven at 800F for 8 hours to melt the Babbitt and eliminate the oil. A lot of my colleague and people from subcontracting companies say that this also eliminates the oil that the casting absorbed. They also say if that step was not done, it would be hard (even impossible) to repair cracks by welding because oil would be in the material.

Can a metal casting really absorb oil if it’s submerged for long periods of time? I would have tendency to say no, oil is only present on the surface but that’s my point of view.

Hope my question is clear! Thank you!

96,Why do some bike pumps work better?,1434381058,"I have a fairly simple pump where a piston slides up and down a single barrel. The piston has a one way valve formed of a couple of holes and and an external o-ring that slides up and down allowing it to intake air on the upstroke then compressing and expelling the air on the down stroke. There's a one way valve immediately at the end of the barrel letting the compressed air out.

Using this setup it gets harder to pump towards the end of the stroke I assume because its building pressure before it exits into the innertube. As far as I understand the pump only needs to equalise the air in the pump to the pressure of the air in the innertube before it goes in. This however means that in one stroke of the pump the air needs to get to pressure in the short space that the piston travels.

I've tried looking up how to do pressure calculations but I don't really know where to start.
Comparing this setup to a track pump - as well as having a more complex one way valve inside the piston, the track pumps I've looked at have an outer barrel around the barrel the piston travels in. This way air moves into the outer barrel after being compressed and travelling through the second one way valve. The ones with this outer barrel seem to have a more consistent pumping motion where it needs an equal force through the entire stroke.
I can't figure out why though. What is happening to the air in this space? Is it building to pressure before it enters the innertube or is it part of the pressure system including the inntertube?
Would the effect be the same if there was simply more space at the end of my existing pump?

They're all household items, iPhones, iPads, and or are dive related electronics.

The following excerpt is all I have re: the power situation on the yacht;

""Power on board is 12V with cigarette plug outlet, which is charged via the engine generator or a connection to the land grid. There is usually a 230V C-type outlet on board as well, but it only supplies power when you are connected to the land grid when in the har- bors.
This means that it is only possible to power appliances such as cell phone chargers and hairdryers when you are in a marina with a power connection, unless you have a 12V charger (the type you would use in a car).
If you really need 230V power when you are not berthed in a marina with a power connection, you can bring a DC/AC inverter. There- fore, you will need to use an inverter and adapter. Inverters are similar to what is used in a car cigarette lighter. ""

In addition, I'm curious how the working environments differs between industry and a government-backed lab. If it helps, I'm primarily interested in work regarding renewable energy/EV's.

Some questions:

How significant is a PhD? I'm planning on getting my Masters, but have no desire to teach. I'm comfortable with the time commitment associated with getting a PhD, but if I don't land a research job I'm fearful I'll be stuck miserable in academia. Is a Master's degree acceptable or will I hit my ceiling early?

Does GPA matter beyond 3.5? I know for graduate school GPA is a large factor, but I don't know if labs are attracted to the 4.0's too. Industry seems to have a binary evaluation of ""above 3.0 or below 3.0"" - how is GPA evaluated for the labs?

How steady is employment that is based on funding? Being dependant on grants/legislation seems risky in my head, but I don't know how this pans out in reality. Are you ever in a situation where you're finding out in November if you'll have a job in January? I don't want to go to college for 8 years and end up in a field with no job security.

How busy is a typical week? In industry, deadlines affect profits so a sense of urgency is always present. While this can be stressful, the satisfaction of knowing you're doing real work and affecting consumers is fantastic. Is research similar? I don't know if a job requiring more theory means it's harder to see the fruits of labor, or if days are less demanding.

These are a lot of unrelated questions, but I'd really appreciate any insight. It's a tricky world to try and understand on the outside.",AskEngineers,oneplusoneoverphi,/r/AskEngineers/comments/39rl7h/do_you_work_in_a_national_lab_doe_or_research_lab/

I'm not 100% sure if this is the right subreddit, so apologizing in advance if it isn't. But I'm sure some of you smart folks know if this could be possible or not!

So I did my best to make a picture: http://i.imgur.com/dGIHin2.png

Basically the idea is this: There is a large block of ice, that slowly melts while sitting in a very specific spot that keeps the upper half at freezing point (Maybe with the cooler, maybe it's possible with just some sort of insulation? I'm really not sure), while the bottom just warm enough to melt. The melted water flows through a turbine (I called it a dam device, not sure why but yeah lol), and the turbine powers a generator. The generator then powers a pump that filters the water that has already powered the turbine, back to the top of the ice, freezing and pretty much repeating.

I'm not even sure if the small amounts of water would be enough to provide enough power for the dam, and then again if the ice was large enough, that would just mean more power for a larger pump, so honestly that alone could be the huge flaw.

Now I don't claim to be an intelligent person, so a lot of this could be a very simple answer as to why it would never work, but I was just curious as to if it COULD work if set up right. Honestly it was just driving me crazy and I had to get some opinions about it, or even blunt criticism, whatever works!

I have an LM7805 on the input to regulate higher voltages down to 5v, so to that end I was thinking of using 4x1.5V AAA cells, of an NiCd type as these tend to have the longest life (according to [this](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/whats_the_best_battery) site at least).

This should give me an input of 6V and a relatively good lifetime. I am going to connect a CR2032 watch style battery to the DS1307+ in order to provide it's backup power supply as well. 

Do you think this is the best solution, or is there a better way of going about it which will make the product both functional and easy to get replacements for all while having a reasonable life span?

Since graduation, in the field, I have worked more in construction and engineering, specifically doing construction documents and am now bridging slowly over to doing some design work, as I currently work for a civil engineer now. I prefer the more technical side of things and prefer working for an engineer over an architect as of right now, though I still enjoy critical thinking and the act of designing something, even if it's just a sidewalk or something.

Here is where I am stuck. I have the ID-3LA RFID reader (purchased from sparkfun) placed on my breadboard which does not have an internal antenna.

The transponder arrived today, and it is much smaller than I imagined (even after looking at the specs for some reason) and I have no clue on how to connect it to my breadboard. I have just been resting it on two exposed wires that are connected to the ID-3LA's two antenna ports. Can anyone clarify this for me?

For instance, the [Armstrong Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_Gun) was constructed by winding a bar of wrought iron into a spiral, then shrinking that onto the cannon to reinforce it, almost as if the iron were a piece of rope that was stronger in the longitudinal direction.

Another example was a patent by Horatio Ames to twist bars of iron to make them stronger, again as if making rope.

I'm dealing with a heritage building in the UK. It has a number of old cast iron pipes inside the wall that are supposed to take water from the gutters down to the sewers, 14-20m down.

Some of these origional pipes have been cut into and diverted into modern plastic pipes, others remain cast iron throughout their length. Due to neglect, most of these pipes are blocked, or drain very very slowly meaning the gutters overflow into the building in heavy rain. Rodding has not been successful due to assumed bends or possibly solidified debris. We're not even certain of the exact route these pipes take.

53,Material Strength in cheap DIY vacuum chamber,1434111073,"Hey,

I'm hoping to build a small (around 150mm dia by 150mm tall) low/medium vacuum chamber for degassing and general meddling.

There are various DIY examples around the net of people using pressure cookers and other 'pressure vessels', but some reading suggests that the ability to tolerate higher than ambient pressures (where material is primarily in tension, and 'hoop stress' gets mentioned a lot) is quite different to negative vs ambient (in which compression and buckling failures occur).

With that in mind, is there some simple method of determining the appropriate material &amp; thickness necessary to retain vacuum for a given size of vessel?

I'm imagining a capped cylinder, probably made of heavy walled HDPE gas piping with one end capped with thick aluminium plate, and the other perspex or polycarbonate or something similar. Pipe would be ID of ~150mm, and if [this listing](http://www.vinidex.com.au/products-4/pe-pipe-systems/pe-pressure-pipe/) is representative, then wall thickness can vary from 5-25mm. I'm not sure what street-level natural gas piping is used here (bright yellow, OD probably ~200-300mm), but I'm wondering if it would be suitable, since there's quite a lot of construction going on and I might be able to get some offcuts from the work crews.

[This one](http://www.abbess.com/vacuum/vacuum-clearview) uses 1/2"" acrylic tube/end caps, so I presume that's a reasonable safety margin, but how does one in general determine what material properties are required?

I'm aware that it scales significantly with internal volume - my rough plan of 150mm dia x 150mm height = 2650 cm^3 (161 cubic inches, if I did the conversion right). Is that plausible with non-specialist materials.

Also, I'm only going for shitty vacuum, so chamber wall offgassing and all the other boogeymen hopefully won't apply.

Or are there any other good alternatives? Would an old pressure-cooker (maybe with 25mm acrylic lid) work?",AskEngineers,shobble,/r/AskEngineers/comments/39kpxb/material_strength_in_cheap_diy_vacuum_chamber/

Would you recommend any entry-level, FOSS FEM software? Examples of the practical-ish problems I want to solve:

  * I've designed a vacuum chamber from scratch. The person I hired to weld it claims that a particular seam is unfavorably placed and would fail under cyclical load. He's probably right and I've redesigned it already, but I'd really rather see it myself.
  * I've assembled a R-134a compressor-condenser for a chiller. Now I want to design a heat exchanger that would cool antifreeze in a secondary circuit using R-134a in the primary one. So I'd like to run a simulation to see how it would perform.

I'm like 80% sure neither of these *requires* the use of FEM but I want to use them as an opportunity to learn.

I've looked around and there are apparently a bunch of FOSS FEM packages, most of which involve composing numeric code from C++ templates. That, frankly, being an awful UI, it's not a major obstacle--I know C++ and could probably waddle through the numeric code with some effort--still I'd really rather use something friendlier, or at least appreciate a pointer to which of the inscrutable heaps of C++ I should invest time learning.",AskEngineers,whitequark,/r/AskEngineers/comments/39k65y/entrylevel_maybe_foss_fem_software/

In it there was a bike who's wheels had ""Electro-mag suspension"" with ""zero resistance"". This got me thinking on whether this was true or not. I haven't been able to find any answers by searching.

Say we ignore any air resistance, or any other effect which could cause friction. Would a device travelling at a constant velocity with maglev suspension truly encounter zero resistance? I have a hard time believing that the magnetic field could be so perfectly uniform that some of the force vectors are not against the direction of travel, instead all pointing upwards against gravity. Magnetic fields are curved, not directly upwards. The same sentiment is felt for that bike's wheels. I feel like the wheel would have a tendency for its magnets to align with the magnetic field produced by the frame, not spin freely.

Also, going into a little bit of structural engineering here, I can also see resistance in the track itself. Due to Newton's 3rd law, this track or frame will be encountering large forces for the supports holding the magnets which will cause it to deform slightly. This deformation will require energy which would have to come from the kinetic energy of the train/wheel, thus slowing it down. Another form of resistance.

73,National Engineering Stereotypes: What Are They &amp; How Did They Come To Be?,1434029579,"I've heard of a few national engineering stereotypes:

* German engineering is the best.
* Japanese engineering lasts forever.
* American engineering is brutish and wasteful - they never account for their surroundings and just ""make solutions work"" regardless of whether it's the best solution possible.
* Middle-Eastern engineers are corrupt and don't care about safety.

So, how did these stereotypes come to be?  Is there any truth to them?  Are there others?

My first thought about ""German engineering is the best"" is how many codes and research is written in the United States.  Here in the US, it seems we're always pushing the limits with new materials or new techniques.  We have CFRP tendon prestressed concrete bridges going in around the US, for example.  That's pretty new and cool.

As to the ones I listed, I feel like the first two are a ""common knowledge"" level of stereotype.  I hear it all over, so I don't know if there's any truth to them or if it's the result of too many VW and Honda commercials.

The one about American engineering I heard from a European engineer.  He had quite a bit of disdain for American civil engineering and said ""we'll just stick a building anywhere.  No care for how it looks, what it's made of, how it interacts with the environment.  Just *plop.""""  He said in Europe, they don't have as much space, so they're very conscious about all of these elements and work hard to build with the environment instead of in spite of it.  I've never worked in Europe, so I don't know if it's true.

The last one came from a Middle Eastern engineer giving a guest lecture at our school.  He said that because the contractors are so corrupt, the engineers just follow along.  He claimed to personally see structures being built with trash in the concrete mix to save money on materials, or substandard materials being substituted to save money.

I'm running some particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements to characterize the flowfield in my small wind tunnel. The system sprays droplets of olive oil into the inlet, while a laser pulses at a specific frequency, creating a plane in the tunnel. A camera looks through the clear acrylic sidewall and takes pairs of photos of the olive oil as it flows through the laser sheet. From the photos, the software computes the velocity vectors of the flowfield.

The problem is, as these tests can run for a few minutes, the olive oil condenses on the acrylic sidewall and eventually blocks the view of the camera. After every test we have to disassemble and clean so the camera has a clear view. For reference, the olive oil droplets have a diameter of about 1 micron, and their injection position is already as far away from the sidewall as possible.

I am working on a nozzle design. The Current design include a Delrin nozzle press fit into a SS tube. But due to air pressure the nozzle keep popping out of the tube after certain operation. 
I have designed several new concept, one of them which I received from go from end customer is to provide lancing on the fill tube and a pocket on the nozzle, which is then press fitted and when reaches the pocket get set into that.
Now the concern is the manufacturing feasibility of the lancing operation.
The parts dimension in question are follows:
SS tube OD = 10 mm Wall thickness = 1mm
Nozzle length 17.5 mm
is it okay to make a lancing on the 1 mm thick SS tube?
Will it hold the Nozzle for a test pull force of 30 lbs?

Any suggestion to refinement of design and other details would be appreciated.

89,"Summer Project:Sorting plastic, can/aluminum and glass bottles for recycling.",1433916219,"Hello everyone that was kind enough to enter this post. As a fun summer project I decided to do like an automatic sorter for the 3 recyclable bottles: plastic, aluminum and glass. I am planning on using an Arduino for this project because I am a Computer Engineer Major currently in College(CSU Sacramento). 


Current Ideas:


Use a funnel as the input. Take cans one at a time. 
After figuring out what kind of  material it is, it will go down a chute that has 3 possible routes, I can use servos to close off routes so that when bottle will be guided to its  destination. 

To figure out what kind of material the bottle is:
I was thinking of using a weight scale of some kind to detect if the bottle is of glass.Then, because it's glass and I don't want to break it, use like a belt and slowly bring it down into a bag/can and dump it in there.
For plastic and aluminum cans i thought of using weight scale but cans and plastic bottles come in all shapes and sizes.
i was also thinking of using a laser and a laser sensor. If the sensor  recieved the laser, then its a plastic bottle. and the other is a can. 

However  I think this wouldn't work if the plastic bottle/aluminum can are compressed which would probable lead to the laser beam refracted away from the sensor.

If anyone has any ideas of what else i can do to sort out the plastic and aluminum, please tell me.",AskEngineers,DatChoob,/r/AskEngineers/comments/399jsv/summer_projectsorting_plastic_canaluminum_and/

Background: I am going to a camping festival and need to support the center of a large 50'x50' tarp which will cover a large communal area for our group. The center support is going to be a 7' 4x4 and the perimeter will be supported by (4) Ezups canopy and then anchored to cars.

29,Resources to learn about non-thermoplastic polymers? I can't seem to find good resources to research when I search google... only ads for Gorilla and Loctite,1433779167,"To be more specific, I'm creating a part that needs a two-part compound fill in a milled cavity. The fill will act as structural reinforcement to the 7068 aluminum body. The cavity is created to help reduce the weight of the part, and to act as a fixture point for the 4th axis milling.

This is a small-scale production (&lt;1000), and will need approximately 11.25 milliliters of compound for each part. So far, I've found that [Hilti RE-500](https://www.us.hilti.com/anchor-systems/injectable-adhesive-anchors/r3783) could be a reasonable choice, since it comes in an easy-to-dispense package, has negligible expansion properties, bonds well to chemically etched 7068 aluminum, has great UV and chemical resistance once set, and has high compression strength.

Hilti RE-500 is rather expensive, though, so I would really like to find a more cost-effective solution.

The world of non-thermoplastics seems to be a tough nut to crack. Are there any great resource for finding out more about plastics?

37,Heaterbox application - Thermofluid calculations,1433733819,"Hi all,

We have a number of steel drums containing some substances that have turned ""waxy"" after being left in ambient temp (say lowest 10degC). The customer wants to ""melt"" it all back to liquid using a heated box with forced convection up to 60degC i.e. delta T of 50 over 8-12hours.

I haven't included the energy required for latent heat between the semi-solid to liquid phase of the substance.

Have calculated that we'll need 600kJ to heat the air up, 740,000kJ to warm the substance up, and 7,000kJ to warm the drums up.

Total of approx 750MJ.

Over 8 hours, calculated to approx 26kW.

Will this be the heated element rating required? What sort of airflow should I be looking at?

Cheers


EDIT - After scratching my head and thinking back to thermofluids in University, the whole plethora of convection calculations are involved. i.e. heating the air to 60deg, which therefore needs to flow past the drums with SA of Xm^2, at a velocity of Xm/s to give us a convective transfer coefficient of h. Then there's the conduction through the metal wall of the drums, then finally conduction/convection to the semi-solid substance?

Is there any simplifications regarding the mixed conduction and natural convection, as well as the latent heat from solid-liquid of the substance to get it from the semi-solid state at 10deg to the liquid state at 60deg (unsure when the melt point is yet).

This heat transfer or ""loss"" in the air is then the amount of power we need to put in the system to maintain that transfer, therefore sizing our heating elements?",AskEngineers,mequackquack,/r/AskEngineers/comments/38zg0a/heaterbox_application_thermofluid_calculations/

I've not been able to find a circuit diagram for them both yet - still looking.

I've found the interference to be minimal, and hooked the PIR output to the Tx input pin.

I added an LED and 10k resistor to the data out of the Rx board, and the light would light briefly when the PIR went high.

BUT - I thought the Rx output would be high while the Tx is sending a signal, but it appears to only output when the signal appears and disappears.

Hence my need to oscillate the PIR's output into the Tx board.

That way, a constant square wave (10Hz, 50Hz, 500Hz?) will keep the Rx high.

I don't care about brief false Rx data from radio noise, the LED can flash like lightning for all I care - it's a SUPER CHEAP toilet engaged system. My instruction booklet would explain that the indicator needs to stay on for several seconds to show the toilet in use.

I know an MCU could cut out those false flashes, and produce a saw tooth Tx signal, but that's 2 MCU's at maybe $1 for both! (I've used ATTiny directly, TI's F2013's and Arduino platform.)

71,"Will a perfectly straight, perfectly isotropic column with a perfectly centralized load buckle?",1433561012,"I got into this debate with a colleague the other night.  The argument boils down to whether ""lim v→0"" in the Euler buckling derivation is exactly equal to 0.

In the Euler buckling load derivation, Euler used a lim as v→0 to derive π²EI/L², where v is defined as the column deflection.  My colleague claims that since v→0 = 0, then that means a perfectly straight, perfectly isotropic column with a perfectly centralized load would buckle.  I however, argue that v→0 ≠ 0 exactly.  I argue that when Euler says in his derivation ""lim v→0"" this implies that there is the ever so slightest initial out-of-straightness in the column, and, therefore, a column as described would only experience PL/AE deformations.

As an electrical engineer in the Silicon Valley, he's worked for company after company that shut down. He sat me down and told me several things about why becoming an engineer is not a good idea whatsoever. All of it was very disheartening, and I was hoping that you, engineers, could either confirm, clarify, or offer significant examples disproving what he has told me. :


* The salary you receive as an engineer does not allow you to have a significant amount of savings. (He explained this through an example of a $90,000 starting salary and a $70,000 overall living expense - I was kind of skeptical about this one, as I'm just a high school student).

* Anyone can code or learn engineering. (He gave me examples of successful engineers that majored in something unrelated to engineering that did well in their companies; he also taught himself a majority of what he knows now).

* Working on a project in a company or creating new technology is difficult because people are not going to want to take on extra work and risk their job if it fails. 

* You will not go much farther above what you started as an entry level applicant unless you work towards management, which is difficult considering you are competing with over 50 qualified coworkers or candidates.

* You will not be recognized for your work or the extra hours you put in very easily. 

* Most people you will work with will be apathetic. 

* When you get a job at a company, you never know if that company is truly going to succeed or run out of business. It's simply luck if you are accepted  or pick a company to work for that actually succeeds.

* Technology moves so quickly that by the time you are 30 - 40 years old, your knowledge will be outdated and the risk of losing your job will be dangerously high. 

* In the end, there is no meaning to your job because you won't have the opportunity to truly be involved in decisions or significant, successful development.

* (To me:) ""The very successful engineers are those who already accomplished a great deal by 15 years of age and went on to found successful companies. You have intelligence, but it's very unlikely you have anything profound. You've not done anything, otherwise I would have suggested engineering as your career."" (That's funny, because he always discouraged me from learning to code or even joining my robotics team. He never gave me the chance. But it's a fair point - how do I even know I'd be good at engineering?)


I understand that some of the stuff I'm sharing with you might be offending to some engineers that take pride in their work. I was very upset to have heard all of this. I'm sorry. I just want to know whether what he has said is the hard truth or partly exaggerated or independent to his experience and his companies' environments. I want to become an aerospace engineer, a part of furthering technology to feasible space travel and colonization. I'm okay with never becoming wealthy. I'm okay with never being able to set foot on another planet or geophysical body other than Earth. I just want to help humanity get off this planet, even if I won't see it in my lifetime. I realize that this endeavor might be naive, but its the only thing that kept me alive during a rough, dark year, and what I work incredibly hard for now. I appreciate all of your responses.

78,Need help understanding something about op-amps. Exam is on Monday!,1433545190,"I posted this in r/electricalengineering, but not getting helpful answers and I need one soon because I have an exam Monday. Hopefully someone here knows.

1) When someone says ""negative feedback"" with respect to an op-amp, does this mean that the feedback is achieved by wiring the feedback through the inverting input? My professor said that negative feedback just means to oppose changes in the output of the op-amp, but my textbook says it's when the feedback is through the inverting input. 

2) One of the ideal op-amp rules is that the inverting and non-inverting inputs are at the same voltage. When is this true, though? Is it ALWAYS true of every op-amp or only when there is negative feedback (if so, please define what you mean by negative feedback)? I want to know when I can use the idea that V+ = V- in circuit analysis. 

3) At this time, I am under the impression that the inverting and non-inverting inputs are at the same voltage when there is negative feedback (as in feedback through the inverting input). But when I try to do the math regarding a non-inverting negative feedback op-amp, something doesn't seem right.  I don't find that V+ and V- are equal. For example, consider [this circuit](http://s3.amazonaws.com/answer-board-image/06d89172-46ba-4494-b116-ea738f16129e.jpeg) with the following parameters: 

Assume we have an op-amp with negative feedback through the inverting input with these parameters: Gain = 3, V+ = 10 V, Vout = 30 V, and there is a voltage divider that cuts the V- input to half of Vout
At first, V- = 15 V. So, Vout = Gain(V+ - V-) = 3(10 - 15) = 3(-5) = -15. Now V- = 15/2 = -7.5. So the next Vout = 3(10+7.5) = 52.5. V- = 52.5/2 = 26.25.

Essentially I want to try and make a small motor driven device that slides an object on a horizontal path when a button is pressed.  Ideally I'd like to have the object return to its original position after its travel.  I guess the motion would be similar to that of an Inkjet printer as it slides along - although I do not require an jerky back and forth, just a horizontal slide one direction - hit the end point, and then return to its starting position.

They are used as follows

1. Hot Wire
2. Neutral
3. Ground Wire

Both the Hot and Neutral wires come from the power plant. 

The ground wire is connected to a metal pole buried deeply near your house (literally ground).  

When a device has a ground wire it usually has a metal case and is used as a grounding wire so that you don't get shocked when touching the case. 

The weird thing about ground is that **at the fuse box it's connected to neutral**

since they are forced to have the same voltage (due to the connection) what is the purpose of having a ground on the outlet? 

I imagine they are connected in a rare case that the neutral line gets ""dirty"" power and could shock the user, but since it is connected to ""ground""  directly that shouldn't be the case.

94,Design Challenge at Large Tech Company,1433485944,"I recently interviewed for a product design position at a large tech company and as a second phase to my interview process they have me a design challenge to complete. I was wondering if some of you more experienced engineers can give me some tips, design considerations and also processes that can be used.

The design challenge is essentially to design a machine in CAD that can bend a quarter in half so that the two faces are parallel to each other within about a 5 degree tolerance.

An approach I was thinking of is similar to a flat hemming process in sheet metal. You would essentially use a hand held brake form mechanism to form the quarter but that will only get you so much angular deflection. I was thinking then that after forming the quarter it would then be compressed together by having the dye somehow fold together through a cam mechanism connected to the same handle that controls the brake form so that when the brake form comes back up the dye compresses together. Or perhaps when a pressure is applied to the dye by the brake it will cause it to fold inwards.

Does anybody else have any other ideas or suggestions that may be simpler or anything to say about the mechanism I'm thinking of? I'm really interested in what everyone has to say and the different approaches people will take.

Me not being interested in the subject matter consequently meant that I didn't put much effort/ work as i probably should have.

I did a 1 year internship at a big oil and gas company and I learnt a lot on the job and i found that people were helpful whenever i had questions and highly appreciative of the work I did. While I am grateful for the experience (and and much needed money haha) I felt that it stopped becoming a potential career and turned in a 8-5 job that I showed eight months down the road. I felt like a drone working there and while I am not bothered by repetitive tasks/work, the job just became mundane once I stopped learning anything new from it. I was not really satisfied(and happy) with my work, every engineer i worked with had the same ""oh you are doing an excellent job"" whenever I asked them for any positive criticism. I feel that working at a large company isnt exactly for me right now, and Id be much happier working at a small company since i think it will help me be well rounded( and I get to see how a company actually works and not just the engineering aspect of it). Right now I think i value experience over pay, and I feel that I can risk it now when im young(i just turned 22) and have little to no responsibilities. Now with oil and gas not exactly booming(and since Im in Alberta, Canada where Oil and Gas is the major industry), should i apply for small companies(where I think Ill be more happy and productive)or should i take up just any job i come across given the market right now? Im sure there are more people who were in the same situation as me, and I was hoping that someone could give me advice based on their experiences. I am hoping that my one year internship and my experience with school's solar car team will help me out.

23,Can anyone help me design a 4 bar linkage to pitch a cyclocopters blades?,1433375420,"Howdy,

If it's not too much trouble would someone mind helping me on figuring out why I am getting different link lengths for a 4 bar system to pitch a cyclocopters blades from +- 30 degrees deflection to 0?

So I am trying to design this system to pitch 4 cyclocopter blades +-30 degrees. As shown here:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Cyclogyro-Mechanics.gif

now this animation represents what the blades will be doing, but instead of a ring, we will be using a linear actuator on a rotating servo, to achieve the same effect. 

Which will look like the drawing on the left.

http://serve.me.nus.edu.sg/cyclocopter/WebPage_Cyclogyro_files/image026.jpg



So I was trying design a  4 bar linkage dimensions, and I seem to have gotten stuck. The 4 bar linkage is going to pitch 4 blades +- 30 degrees for a cyclocopter. I've been working on the simple 2D drawing and I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. The radius of the cyclocopter is 21in so I assume that to be L1. Then I'm assuming that the blades are mounted at the c/4, and the linkage to cause deflection is attached at 3c/4. This is L2 which is equal to 2.75. L3 is the link that attaches the end of the blade to the linear actuator. L4 is the linear actuator, which I can increase or decrease in length to change the amplitude of the deflection during flight. I assumed L4 to be 2.06ins, this is so we can have a 1.5in linear actuator with a .5in stroke. I'll attach some notebook pages that include my work and the numbers I got. 

Position 1: At no deflection, using geometry I found that L3 is equal to 21.01125in.

Position 2: At 30 degrees deflection, using geometry I found that L3 is 21.8045in.

Position 3: At no deflection, I used a free online cad software to draw the linkages in 2D. The CAD gave me an L3 of 21.549in. I got 21.544 in

Position 4: At -30 degrees deflection, using the same cad software it gave me 20.46588in. I ended up getting 20.4516 in

I know this shouldn't be very difficult, since its just a 2D 4bar linkage, but I can't seem to find why I'm getting different numbers. Maybe I'm missing something that you can point out to me.

Here are pictures of my work.

Now I used simple geometry to solve most of these, but I do not know what exactly I am doing incorrectly. What important information am I missing? 

As I can see in the ring version of this pitching mechanism, I am going to need L4 (Servo, with linear actuator) to change as the blades rotate. I can see  how this works with only one blade attached, but when you include 4 separate blades, I am not sure how to determine the proper lengths. 

Will each separate blade attachment have a different L3 length? 

Do I solve for the L3 length of blade 1 at position 1, then use that length to solve for the L4 length of that same blade at position 2.  Once I have solved for the L4 length of blade 1, I move on to blade 2, solve for its L3 length. Move on to blade 3 and blade 4 and repeat the same process?

I’m not sure how Form outputs its results to Sheets so I might see if I have any luck in Excel since there are add-ons to go from Form to Excel.

2.Is there a way to code a dependent dropdown into Google Forms through appscripts if I don’t have any experience?


In the end, this might be a limitation with Forms. Is there any other alternative?

edit: for 1, I'll just concatenate the columns for now and reformat the Form's info on a different sheet

35,R&amp;D Position,1433344793,"Hi guys,

I got my Master of Science in Chemical Engineering last month (summa cum laude) and a well know chemical engineering company proposed me a good R&amp;D position (abroad) for a year.

I was very excited at first because the pay is high and the company is famous so I accepted the job but then some doubts arose in my mind and I would like to have some feedbacks from more experienced engineers.

If I spend a year working in the R&amp;D and than I want to change kind of job, will I be able to do that? The thing is that I don't want to destroy all my possibilities right after my graduation and I am afraid that by accepting this job other company will not hire me anymore in the future because I do not have experience in their fields. 

It seems to me that if I accept the job and someday I realize that I want to pursue e.g. ""the oil career"" nobody will hire me because I spent one or two years working in a complete different field. 


This thoughts are making me very anxious.

I'm also a volunteer for the Robots For Good project.

At the moment, we're targeting engineers to become members and contribute to Robots For Good, but as a maker and 3D printing enthusiasts myself, I certainly don't consider myself as an engineer.

So my questions are:

Are engineers actually interested in open source hardware projects?

Are engineers actually interested in 3D printing?

Are engineers interested in open source technology like Arduino and Raspberry Pi?

Personally, I'm under the impression that engineers look down on 3D printing slightly. Maybe viewing it as a way of cutting corners, removing the element of craftsmanship (which results in an inferior end product). I may be wrong, but that's why I'm here.

I have to create a project of measurement system for a tank on oil tanker (400-500 DWT  - I know huge). I have to measure: temperature, pressure, fluid level and gas composition. 

I pretty much know what methods I want to use buuut I couldn't find anywhere over internet how exactly such tanks look and any existing solutions for such measurements. I managed to find how it looks on land, but no ship solutions.

Do any of you have access to images/schematics of tanks on oil tankers (best case is petroleum tank), or know what measurement methods are used and how they are placed in/on such tank? If you work in the field and can say what kind of measurement installation you've chosen/done it would be helpful too.

I just completed a year long internship with a fairly small engineering company/branch/division/group and I have not yet been given an official offer/raise as was verbally expressed would happen during initial interview and reiterated during end of calendar year review. Boss man flew out of the country for business instead of talking with me for a few minutes to settle things. 

Yesterday was the last day (to the date!) from when I started, but not a word from HR or boss man. Boss man didn't talk with much certainty when mentioning me continuing after internship was over during end-of-year review which could either mean I'm not doing well or just he's unsure whether I'm going to take off. 

It's pretty unprofessional to have someone report to an office without even knowing if they're getting paid for anything. Analogous to people walking in to apply for a job nowadays. Gut feeling and common sense tells me going back to the office despite not having signed anything is bad but I also don't want to cause a ruckus not showing up if everything is OK and they're just late in notifying how much I'm going to get paid.

I want the design to be modular such that it can be easily transported (I live in an apartment) and rearranged/improved upon (minimal welding and minimal custom machined parts).  

Also the current design attempts to enable 'self-aligning' of critical components giving some wiggle-room on the geometric tolerances of the custom machined components (alignment rods and lead screw).  Side-note: I'll be machining these components myself.

Note modeled yet:

- Lead-screw end supports (will consist of a bearing and bracket)

- Z-AXIS SUB-ASSEMBLY (would appreciate any input here, will provide the model if one feels complied enough to produce it themselves :))

My worries:
- My GIVEN budget is $400 (arduino + g/grblshield + 3 steppers = $150) allowing minimal costs for precision ground rods/screws; still unaware of where my limiting resolution factor is so allocating addition finances is difficult.

- The length of the alignment rods in the bed's horizontal direction cause me fear of bending; I'm looking at hollow stainless steel rods (relatively higher mass moment of inertia compared to price) offering decent concentricity and toying with the idea of filling them with a high-stiffness foam?!

I’m working on a graduation project and was hoping to get some input from anyone who has some advice they can share.

Essentially I have a 12V DC motor removed from an old trolling motor. I’m looking to make a vehicle that will float at the surface of the water while I control it over radio frequency, similar to a diver propulsion vehicle that floats and has no physical diver :P

I’m going into the college tomorrow to run some tests on the motor, since I don’t have a battery for it yet. Which brings me here.

I suspect I’ll need a lipo 12V to keep the vehicle light, is there somewhere cheap you’d recommend purchasing or acquiring? (I’m in Ontario). Or perhaps you have another suggestion?

Also, depending on the speed of the motor, it says 30 lbs thrust but I’m not certain yet, I may search for some deadman switches, or I’ve been told they’re called enabling switches, in case I want to use the vehicle underwater myself (with proper guarding).

Finally, I’m looking into equipping sonar with my Arduino, but I haven’t decided on a sensor yet. Do you have any experience with a product? I want to track the depth of the water from the surface.

These are the only two majors that I am interested in, I already ruled out EE and applied math (which you might suggest after reading this post). 

I'd choose applied physics because I am very interested in physics as a whole, not just the fields that are part of mechanical engineering. Electromagnetism and quantum mechanics, for example. 

However, when I think of what I would like to do with my degree after graduation, I am drawn to companies like SpaceX, Apple... I realise that this doesn't say anything per se, but most job openings I see look for mechanical engineers. 

The thing is, I'm afraid that applied physics, although it is 'applied', does not prepare people for developing technologies of which the result can be clearly seen. For instance: I would probably be more satisfied with my work on a rocket engine or plane wing than my work on a tiny fraction of a computer chip, because the former is so clearly visible. 

Because of this, mechanical engineering is my first choice. If it turns out that I could work on such technologies with a degree in Applied Physics, that may change my mind.

As I imagine it, longitudinal shear stresses are caused by bending of the beam (sliding like a stack of paper when bent). So when deflection is big, the sliding is also big, and that should mean greater longitudinal shear stress. Also a beam deflects most when a point load is in the middle.

Now let's imagine another beam with a point load F infinitely near a support. Shear force will be F near that support and we calculate shear stresses with that. But since in this case, there is no deflection, there also shouldn't be longitudinal stresses, because sliding doesn't occur. But shear stress will be two times bigger using the tau = VS/it equation.

So does transverse shear stress take over when a beam is loaded near a support? If so why is tau = VS/It used to calculate it when the equation describes longitudinal shear?

In addition to the hassle of ordering and waiting for new feedthroughs when one breaks, it means we're hesitant to swap out equipment when necessary, causing delays in research.  

I'm wondering if you know of any connectors for these copper tubes that don't require screws or significant force to connect, withstand vacuum and moderately high temperatures (chamber gets into the couple hundred Celsius range), and ideally ones that can be easily connected and disconnected.  Alternatively, any ideas into how these problems might be avoided otherwise would be much appreciated.

Where I work we test a lot of switches for power tools by hooking them up to a power supply and an electronic load and cycling them.  They want to start testing them with an inductive load to better simulate what the switch will experience once it's in the tool.  I'm looking for loads that will do a variable inductance, and I've found some that will do CZ, but none that will do them at the power levels we need.  Testing can get up to 20VDC at 100A.  The loads I've seen that say they can be run in parallel to increase the power rating specify that you can't run them in parallel in CZ mode.  I've also noticed that most of the loads with CZ only mention settings for a capacitive load and not an inductive load, so I'm not 100% sure that they're what I'm looking for.
Does anyone know of an electronic DC load rated for at least 2000W, 20VDC, 100A that will do a constant inductive load? Or if there's a better way to go about this that I'm not thinking of?

Most of the examples that I've seen use copper or steel, arranged in up to three vertical sections, with a separate drain per section. Some designs use 1/2"" going into 1"" copper, others use a 2 or 3"" steel pipe fed by 1/2"".

1. I'm considering 3/8"" PEX feeding into 2"" PVC, as this is adequate for my flow requirement and would create higher air velocity into the expansion chamber.

2. While PVC is not a good heat sink, it's much cheaper. I wonder if having more expansion chambers would be more effective despite compromising on the material. Assume a low average CFM, so we don't expect it to warm up, and space is not a constraint.

3. Arranging the sections horizontally (with slight pitch for drainage) allows a single drain valve, with no check valves, to serve the whole apparatus.

4. I have no idea how long either the horizontal or the vertical pipes should be. In this drawing, the horizontals are 36"" and the verticals are 10"".

It was wired to ground instead of channel0, and then back to ch8 &amp; ch12(?). 


Tests performed years ago gave mediocre data (I believe bad readings), but I don't know if the same equipment was used. I assume the wiring is incorrect, as the 1303 has ground referencing circuitry built in..

Let's say I am trying to size up the diameter of a shaft under torsion and bending. First, I would set up my formulas for the torsional, and bending moments of inertia as a function of diameter. Then, I would lay down the formulas for stress due to bending and torsion as a function of the moments of inertia. Finally, the formula for von misses stress is expressed in terms of bending and torsional component stresses and solved.  
  
In essence, the von misses stress is purely a function of one variable, diameter, in this scenario. The formulas were separated into chunks purely for readability (think of coding where you separate your subroutines from your main code).  
  
I would like MathCAD to work backwards, and provide me with a diameter based on a specified value for von misses stress. This is a trivial task to do by hand, but tedious as I will need to make these calculations frequently.

Lubrication will be provided by 1 millimeter hole oil nozzle shooting right into where each of the gear mesh.

6,Mechanism Design Help (I'm not an M.E.),1432926865,"I am trying to design a mechanism that stretches rubber tubing using a cable/ pulley system. Basically I take a rubber tube and shove a connector piece down the center of the tube, then connect the connector piece to a linear slide (linear bearing). I then pull the linear slide back and forth using a cable hooked up to a motor. (Link below has a sketch I drew for clarity if needed.)

I am trying to figure out a way to create a (cost effective/robust) mechanism to stretch up to 12 bands at a time. Each band can exert up to 65lbs of force... I sketched out how I think I can test up to 12 bands at a time, but I am worried the torque will be too much on the linear slide since all of the bands are attached to the top of the linear slide.

Long story short, I have a viper system I wired into my vehicle (thanks to the guides on the web). The system sends a -200mA signal when I do certain commands (trunk, Aux1,2,3,4). I would like that signal to open/close a solenoid.

Installing an ardunio to change the signal and all that is actually easier for me to do, but would be overkill for this. So I have been doing some digging and found some thing called "" latching relays"" and a website with a schematic of exactly what I want to do! 

So that brings me to my question, how do I know which exact relays will work for my purpose? On mouser I see a whole bunch of options (
Coil Current, Maximum Switching Current, etc) that I do not fully understand. So far googling has lead me into a dead end with trying to understand all the options. Capacitors, transistors, etc all make sense to me since I worked with them back in college.

This is a throwaway account because of the obvious reasons (a few employees frequent Reddit).

I am currently working for a small Aerospace company where not much design takes place. We have SolidWorks files and we just switch out certain components for different customers we then write out certain specifications and some test data to prove we meet the customer's requirements. This job pays about two dollars more than the cable harness job, but after three months they will give me a raise (not sure by how much). The only manufacturing that happens deals with prototypes. Once parts are made a different company manufactures them for us.

After three months the guarantee is that I will receive a raise that is higher than 49,000 yearly (not sure how much the raise is, that's all I was told).

The aerospace job gives me a cubicle by myself, whereas the cable harness job gives me a cubicle with no walls, essentially a desk and chair out in the open.

49,Da Vinci Robot Questions,1432768116,"So, a family friend gave me the opportunity to 'play' with the Da Vinci Robot Si about a week ago after I told him I'm trying to be a Mechatronic Engineer. He is the head man in charge over it; EVERYTHING with it directly ties to him. BUT he's not an engineer or computer science major as far as I know. 

Long story short,I had metric shit ton of questions, but anything that didn't directly relate to setup, the arms and various tools, basic communication between carts(surgeon's, the robot itself, and another 3rd i forgot the name to), and etc, I didn't continue asking about because he either didn't know or would only able to give a general answer to because he wasn't involved with actual development.

These are some questions that go deeper for anyone that has any idea or wants to take a shot, google didn't really do much:

 1) Does the robot use any code that can be easily named? (As in, does it not use it's own language to communicate with itself and the surgeons control's.)

 2)One of the carts sends info about each movement, instrument being used, arm doing the movement, and a LOT more to Sunnyvale where the actual team in development can refine, analyze and etc.  What are the most prominent things that get looked at when trying to optimize the system besides the mechanical side(see next question) and when the info gets sent to the servers in Sunnyvale, does it just spit out an Everest of code, or.. what?

 3....)He was able to explain that the earlier versions (w/o Si) used a 'clunky' design of cables and wires, and the Si version that I saw uses very small pullys and cables within the arms, while the new Xi uses a variety of Gyro's. Some how the movements in the surgeon's control tells each piece to move, HOW does each one function put simply, what is the benefit to each, and what would the next generation of the machine likely hold in terms of movement.

4)I'm not looking to be a surgeon, so where else can the intricate movements of pullys and gyros be seen outside of the medical field in robots?

In return I can maybe answer some basic questions about it, I might be able to relay some info for those curious. (BASIC. I just got done with one gnarly year here, I don't have to much under the belt)

A little background, I'm just finishing up my BS in Industrial Engineering in the next few weeks and we had a rather open ended group project to work on to help out a company.

*A has a maximum daily output of 168
*B has a maximum daily output of 245
*You are processing an order of 1000 units
*the product is processed in batches of 10 units

Now most of the production scheduling methods we have learned all were working under the assumption that you start processing at work center B after the order is completely done with work center A. Is there a method for determining when is the best time to begin production at work center B such that there is no time spent waiting for products from work center A?

My company has begun asking the engineering department (we aren't an engineering company, we mostly buy and sell) to begin breaking out products down and determining how much they should actually cost to produce. Because of the wide variety of products, this is requiring all of us to step outside our areas of expertise and become experts in a myriad of industrial processes. Right now, I'm trying to get a detailed understanding of metal stamping. 

•How can we best identify how many stampings it takes to produce a     given part? For example, if I have a simple 1 dimensional shape I can assume this was 1 stamping, but if I have a piece with what looks like several different stampings, can I accurately guess how many? Does it really matter once you've determined it was a progressive stamping? 

•Is there a general rule for assigning tooling cost, specifically relating to initial cost vs lifetime? Can we relate the size of the part to the size of the tooling? 

•How complex can tooling be, generally? I know the more intricate the tooling = higher the cost, but at what point does a manufacturer say that a tooling is too complex to warrant paying for, and uses a more simple setup? 

•At what thickness of material does flame/plasma/CNC/water-jet become a more reasonable production method?

•How can we relate the size/tonnage for a press to thickness, projection area, or complexity (or a combination of all 3)? How can we accurately estimate this?

•Are progressive dies used to reduce the tonnage of the machine, or to make high quality/complex parts? Or both?

66,Parallel Plate Capacitor in COMSOL Multiphysics,1432728664,"Hi,
I'm not quite sure if there are a lot of people here who are proficient in COMSOL Multiphysics, but I'm a bit stuck right now. 

 I am trying to simulate a parallel plate capacitor consisting of multiple layers. We are designing a pressure sensor using a capacitor. Basically, we've got multiple steel films, with some kapton films in between.
 The idea is that we apply pressure on the capacitor, as a result the distance between the layers decrease so the capacitance increases. Using this increased capacitance, it should be possible to 'calculate' the pressure applied on the capacitor. The pressure shall be something in the order of 100MPa in our final tests, so we are trying to simulate this as well.

 First, I tried simulating this with two sheets of metal, with a kapton layer in between.  I created the geometry using a 2D-rectange, and the extrude option. I applied -10V on the bottom layer, and +10V on the top layer (using a terminal). I also a boundary load on the top layer, and a roller boundary condition on the bottom layer. I tried to apply symmetry by simulating a quarter of the capacitor and applying symmetry boundary conditions on the two symmetry edges.

 It seems to work alright, but the capacitance value is way off (at least with my calculated values). My calculated value is 50 times as large as the value COMSOL found. (~2nF vs 39pF). My measured value is about 1nF, so that is still a factor 25 difference with COMSOL's answer. (Also, our physical model is a rough test (as proof of concept), so it is fabricated rather poorly. This deviation in the physical model is to be expected)
 I could explain a bit of this deviation due to the fact that I only simulated a quarter and then applied symmetry; I have no idea how COMSOL handles this. But even then, this should only account for a factor of 4. 

 I also tried to simulate this with four sheets of metal and three layers of Kapton. It can calculate the capacitance just fine, but when I try to apply pressure on it, COMSOL either gives an out of memory error, or tells me my result is not convergent. Obviously, I have to optimize the model.

 I used a swept mesh. I tried free tetrahedral, but the computer has issues handling this mesh. It is too resource-heavy. 

 Anyway.   
 - Does anyone know what I am doing wrong with the capacitance. I can expect a deviation with the calculated value, but a factor 30 is a bit extreme.  
 - Does anyone know how I can optimize the problem any further? Ideally I want a capacitor consisting of multiple layers of Kapton, then I want to do a parametric sweep over the applied pressure and see how the capacitance changes over pressure. (It should be linearly, so a single calculation would be acceptable too if a parametric sweep is too much).  

I uploaded my COMSOL files to Google Drive if anyone wants to see them.  
 Simple Parallel Plate: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3wLLdCX07-fVXdKT3NhOENybms/view?usp=sharing  
 Multiple Parallel Plates: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3wLLdCX07-faC11aFhCVzcxSTA/view?usp=sharing  

 The parameters I used for my geometry are measured from my physical model. Except for the thickness of the steel plates, which are way smaller in reality, but are temporarily made bigger in order to make the calculations easier. (Steel thickness should not matter in the case of two steel plates with a dielectric in between)

75,Mud vs tarp and rope - will it hold?,1432689374,"I'm in charge of setting up a mud volleyball court in a parking lot. [~~This link shows my idea for it, a bit simplified.~~](http://i.imgur.com/C1qVNy7.jpg) 

My main issue is that i can't figure out whether this setup will contain the weight of the mud inside. If i'm thinking of this right, only the part of this mud that is water will be pressing against the sides of this tarp. Currently, there's room in the budget to increase the strength of the tarp or the rope; I'm not worried about keeping it all in suspension, as the trash cans are each 450 lbs, and i can add MANY more. 

What i AM worried about is the rope breaking or the tarp not holding up. Mainly the tarp, because i can NOT find ANY info as to the tensile strength of tarps. Like, what the hell? Tarps are heavily used, why ain't this info out there?

Edit: The tarp and trash cans are resting on  the ground, so the only force on the rope and tarp should be the mud pushing on the sides.

76,What's a good resource to learn about material properties and their applications in industry for someone with a ChemE background?,1432689103,"Hi /r/askengineers! I've been working in the polymers industry as a process engineer for some time now, and I'm beginning to take on some design roles that I feel would traditionally be held by mechanical/materials engineers. 

In short, I'm looking to learn the practical aspects of material choices in industrial applications. Emphasis on practical. In other words, I want to be able to answer questions like: What are the tradeoffs of making this part out of aluminum instead of steel (what am I sacrificing in exchange for a lighter part)? Why 304 vs 316L? Should this piece be made of urethane or silicone? Nickel plated or stainless? What's my best choice of material for a part that will experience a certain type of fatigue? What's the best bang for my buck in corrosion resistance?

My background as a ChemE consisted of a very fundamental materials science course (crystal structures, phase diagrams, stress/strain curves, what is a ceramic etc). I understand those basics well enough, but they clearly haven't prepared me in a practical sense. I understand that much of this comes with experience, but I'd like to expedite my learning as much as I can in the mean time.

So I'm confused about what I'm learning in school and what's going on in the real world. In school, we learn that we can approximate incompressible flow in compressible fluids as long as the Mach speed is low.

However, I'm looking at a simulation of a nitrogen purge on a liquid propane line, and it doesn't quite hold with what I've learned in school. Everything is for sure waaaayyy under 0.3 Ma.

I'm injecting way more N2 than liquid propane is being displaced. What is going on?

TLDR and some numbers:

A line purge simulation shows that for every 1m^3 of liquid propane discharged, I need to inject ~50m^3 of N2 (STP). The N2 is pressurized to ~4.5-5.0 MPa.

I read up a [piece of information](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/features/b3ef06fca462fcad/)  regarding how noise-cancellation in headphones work and understood its like producing equal and opposite noise waves ( we want to avoid- background noise) and try to cancel it out with the background noise  

So to take up this idea to a different level.  Why can't we do this same concept to live concert?  

**Idea: **  

Like the way background noise is picked up and nullified in headphones why can't we pick up the concert music happening in open air and treat it as a background and nullify it by an equal and opposite wave ( So that only people in concert will hear the music and outside it will just don't hear anything)   
 

it will so much easy to do live concert near resident, office areas as, only people in concert will get the feel of it and no one else. No?  

Is it this easy? If yes, why isn't it done?   

I just tried to think out some problem with this and     

* Is it that noise-cancellation of loud music is different and difficult to do?  
* Is the presence of different waves ( micro-waves, radio-waves etc) in air in open air, disallowing us to cancel out efficiently?  
* Is the source to identify the music and reproduce it very difficult to create?    
or what is it that is stopping this  into reality?  



Edit :  Can't we just take forward the idea of Acoustic decoupling ( room within a room) and apply it to a concert?

After some exposure to the field and research at home I am starting to feel like structural engineers are somewhat undervalued in society.

8,Choosing the right stepper motor for a satellite tracking system,1432572810,"Hi everyone, I am an electrical engineer and I am trying to build an antenna rotator system to track satellites throughout the sky. To show you what exactly I mean, I tried to draw a little [sketch](http://imgur.com/zn5UlnK).

What you see is two identical antennas (blue) mounted on a tripod, together with two stepper motors. Stepper motor M1 takes care of the rotation in the azimuthal plane, while stepper motor M2 takes care of the rotation in the elevation plane. This way I am able to track satellites in the sky using my computer. The only problem that I am facing right now, is what kind of motor to use.

From my basic class in mechanics that I had a long time ago, I remember that the torque on M1 is zero. The torque on M2 is something of the form (assuming a uniformly distributed weight in the antenna, thus a center of gravity on L/2): 2*m*g*(L/2); with 'm' the mass of one antenna, and 'L' its length. For my system, that has m = 0.5kg and L = 1.5m this gives me a torque of about 7Nm. To reduce this torque, since these motors are expensive, I thought I should add some counterweights.

The thing I am struggling with now is that, assuming I have good counterweights, neither of my motors will have any torque on them, so what kind of motors do I choose to have some kind of margin of safety? Would choosing a motor that can deliver torque of 1Nm be enough? Are there any other factors important in this? Speed is not an issue here, my motors should be able to rotate 1 degree about every 3 seconds. I am struggling with the fact that M1 has zero torque, yet it has to move a certain mass when rotating. To which motor specification can I relate this mass?

I hope I'm not making a fool of myself here, I'm an electrical engineer so this really isn't my kind of stuff, if you can help me out or see an error in my reasoning, please let me know! Thanks!

9,"Studying Civil Engineering, some questions about my future in structures",1432572801,"Hi all-

I'm studying Civil Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, going into my third year. I am planning to specialize into Structural, with the long term goal of working in aerospace.


This summer I will be interning for the second time at an aerospace design firm, working in technical design. This basically means I get hands on work with design-for-manufacture, and some large scale R&amp;D projects. Admittedly this is more mechanical based. I was an intended ME, but after realizing my talents and interests within engineering, civil structural really fits the bill for me, and I am very excited.


I know peers who have gone on to work in structures and payloads at Boeing, and that is a route that I want to pursue. My internship work is on-site at Boeing (though not *for* Boeing), and from the opportunities I've had to see their work, I love it. In the case that my current company does not have opportunities for structures focused work after university, I am set to pursue somewhere like Boeing.


However... here's where my question comes in: I've heard two conflicting sets of advice about my plans:

* ""Boeing and other aerospace companies employ a ton of CivEs for testing and structures. My friend ""xx"" graduated with his B.S. in Civil and works at Boeing""
* ""If you have any hope of working in aero structures, you better get a masters""


Who is right here? I can't necessarily afford a masters right off the bat, and was hoping to work for a while, gain enough money (or a company who would pay for it), and then return for a masters. I have an excellent foot in the door for the aero industry as it stands, and would prefer not to lose it, but if a masters is ""necessary"", I suppose I'll have to reevaluate my game plan here.

I have no actual experience, no research, and no professional network. In addition to that, my GPA is not very good. I had 2.93 out of 4.00, which was around the average of my class. This cost me a year of my life, and I was not able to find any jobs or internships that were willing to train me. I even applied for technician jobs trying to get hold of relevant field, but I haven't had any luck either. As a result, I've been working in local deli for a year after graduating, with 2 interviews that employer never bothered to call me back (On the other hand, Deli managers have been trying to prevent me from moving away from the work because my work ethics are very good). 

Well, enough of my depressing stories. So currently I think I have two choices: either pursue second bachelor's degree or masters degree. Which  would be a better choice for me? 

I would like to thank you for your time (even for just reading my boring writing style) and wish you a great rest of your day.

Sincerely,

27,Let's talk about Google tone,1432493784,"Recently, Google has released a chrome extension called [Google Tone](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-tone/nnckehldicaciogcbchegobnafnjkcne). Its purpose is to quickly share a website to others in the same room, and it does that by playing a sound that the extension picks up on the receiving end.

Of course I thought it would be cool to hear how they encode an URL using sound, and after using it for the first time I found it remarkable how nice it sounded (you would think that a bunch of ""random"" information would not sound good at all, but it's like your everyday ringtone). However, seeing that the sound is very short and that it's the same for every URL, I concluded that it encodes nothing and is just a signal for the extension to listen to.

I fired up iSpectrum (a program that is a rudimentary spectrum analyser) and got [this waterfall diagram](http://i.imgur.com/HVnggE5.png) (it's a linear scale, 0 Hz to the left and 22 kHz to the right). Obviously, the sound it plays is on the top left. However, I see some other sound a bit higher than 18 kHz that quickly shows up before the audible sound, and also after it, though at a lower amplitude. It only occurs when I play the sound. Could it be that the URL information is encoded there? Maybe somebody more knowledgeable and/or someone with better tools than me can chime in.

Another (boring) possibility is that they send the URL to Google's servers and send it to every Google Tone extension that has heard a sound in the past second or so and is somewhat close to the sender's location.",AskEngineers,balducien,/r/AskEngineers/comments/374876/lets_talk_about_google_tone/

32,Need a budget feather pluck/measure/sort machine for small business - would this be viable?,1432466984,"Hi Engineers, thank you for taking the time to read this. 

I run a small business selling feather fashion accessory products. I work a 60 hour week and hire a part time employee to do a lot of manual labor. The feathers need to be plucked from a dried rawhide piece of bird, measured by length, and sorted by length. They are delicate and require handling that isn't too harsh.

I spend 90% of my work time doing this manual labour by hand, and have a part time employee doing the same. I would love to have a machine that would allow me more time to concentrate on the rest of my business, which now takes a backseat to the sheer volume of manual labour involved. 

Would it be viable for me to hire a mechanical engineer, or a student, to construct such a contraption? I don't have a massive budget. £10,000 would be really pushing it, but realistically I'd like to spend less than that.

The feathers are very delicate and can only be pulled/held/sorted from the top of quill down direction, otherwise they get ruffled and damaged. They would need to come out all facing the same way. 

The hides have 2 completely different kinds of feather- very long skinny ones along the top and sides, and big wide fluffy ones in the middle.The hides are flat pieces.The feathers all sit in the same direction on the hide. 

It's probably just a pipe dream, but I thought it might be worth asking  if it would be viable at all to even consider having a machine built within a small budget.

I have a customer that requests their fasteners by using the SAE PIN serials, (e.g. SAEJ2295F496#######). Because of my experience, most of the serial (PIN) makes sense. However, there are some numbers that don't make sense at all. And some that, I THINK, are discontinued? (J2665?). I have been up one side of Google and down the other, but I cannot find a ""key"" or ""legend"" that defines the numbers. Some of them I can plainly see the ASTM spec called out, others I don't have a clue what my customer is trying to order. I even talked to my employer about purchasing the documentation for this series, but they are quite expensive, and we don't manufacture, so we don't reall need the technical information, we just need to know the size, fastener style, spec callouts, plating, etc. It seems like SAE would have a legend or a key somewhere for deciphering the PINs for all the various fasteners they reference, but I cannot find it anywhere.

60,A engineering question related to 6061-T6 Aluminum,1432331312,"I want to apologize upfront if this is in the wrong category.  If there is a more appropriate forum for engineering related questions, please let me know.

TL;DR, I am purchasing a 1140lb safe that I would like to raise off the ground using 6, 6"" pieces of aluminum.  Is the safe going to ""squish"" the aluminum? Is it safe?  Is there some other type of metal that I should be using instead?

Ok - here is the full question with images. 

We are installing a gun safe in our basement and wanted to keep it a couple inches off of the ground (on the off chance we ever ended up with water, [see this image](http://i.imgur.com/AJoHQss.png).)

As you can see from the safe, it is rather large. It is 72"" tall, 42 wide, and 27.5 deep.  I was hoping to evenly space [6 pieces of metal evenly across the bottom as such](http://i.imgur.com/o9pKlB7.png).

I was thinking that if it would work to run 6 pieces of i-beam it would also allow us to use a pallet-jack to place it in the location.  However, I have no idea what-so-ever how strong steel or aluminum is.  I'm assuming it would be more than strong enough, but the safe also weights 1140 pounds - so it's not light either.  I went and purchased 6 pieces of [6"" ASTM B221-08 6061-T6 Aluminum American Standard I Beam](http://www.discountsteel.com/items/6061_Aluminum_American_Standard_I_Beam.cfm?SKU_NO=10) with the hopes that it would support the safe. However, when receiving the aluminum, I was starting to doubt if it would be strong enough.  It seems so light and small compared to the giant safe.

The specifics to the [thickness of the i-beam can be found here](http://www.discountsteel.com/items/6061_Aluminum_American_Standard_I_Beam.cfm?SKU_NO=10) and [here are some other dimensions that might be useful.](http://i.imgur.com/ovE65rQ.png). 

I decided to go with 6 pieces vs 3 long pieces because I liked the idea of being able to shim each piece independently because I know that the concrete floor (covered by carpet) is not level. My rudimentary thinking is that since there are 6 pieces of aluminum and the safe ways 1140 pounds that each piece would only need to support about 190 pounds.  Does that even make any sense?  I just want to feel confident that 10 years done the road (or even when we first place the safe) that it doesn't crush the aluminum causing it to tip over and potentially hard someone.

Even though I have already purchased some aluminum, I don't take delivered of the safe for 26 days. So, if this is unsafe, dumb, or I should be using some other type of materials, I should have ample time to order it before delivery.

I applied for Masters program throughout the country and only got accepted into the M.Eng. program in Mat Sci &amp; Eng at Boston University. No funding was offered. (TA positions are limited as well. Undergrad to grad student ratio is 2:1)

The tuition is going to be $47K a year! I already have $30K student loans from my B.S. degree in Chemistry. Plus housing and living expenses in Boston will probably be around $15K. This means  if i choose to complete the M.Eng degree in 1-year with just coursework (no research), I would come out with ~$92K student loans.

I am also starting to believe that a coursework-only Masters degree is worthless since I cannot prove I have accomplished anything or gained any new skills to show employers. If i choose to do 2-years for the M.Eng program and take up a graduate-project, that would be &gt;$130K tuition by the time i finish!!

( After finishing my B.S. degree in Chemistry, i don't really enjoy it. I want to go into solid-mechanics and do testing on mechanical properties of materials. So not doing a Masters is not an option for my career goals. )

I was considering just reapplying again next year to in-state universities, so the tuition would only be $12K/yr. However, this means i have to find a job during the gap year. The problem is that I will not be able to find any relevant Materials Engineering solid mechanics jobs since I don't have a background in that yet with my chemistry degree.

That thread asked about a kind of ""Radiator PC"" for distributed computing. Got me to thinking: what if I could just make use of the heat my PC already makes? What about Summer? I figure that I'll always need hot water at home, so what if I could dump the PC's heat into my hot water heater? Is this a feasible idea?

My layperson idea is that you'd place a reservoir just before the water-heater input. This reservoir would be large, so as to retain the heat of the water rather than have it radiate into the air.

Your PC would sit nearby, with a standard water-cooling loop patching into the reservoir rather than going to a radiator with fans. The reservoir would contain all the heat produced by the PC, and would be flushed with fresh cold water from the town water supply whenever you turn on a hot-water tap.

Disregarding the exact placement of all the components, what would it take for such a setup to actually work?

1) What level of engineering do civilian workers in the air-force do? Is it allot of new development, is it just checking the development that contractors do? I'm very driven, and am looking for something challenging and interesting. 

2) would it be possible to change careers from air force to a field that emphasizes atmospheric fluid mechanics after 6 years? Is it frowned upon to change fields like that?

Here's a video of the sport itself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPNzxVMQiYE

The vehicle isn't allowed any power source, only gravity and exterior human pushing, so conservation of speed is essential.  Minimum friction, maximum stiffness, but with a fairly high resistance to shock and axial force.  Longevity isn't as much of a factor, given that new bearings are often used for each race.

As of now, standard ball bearings are the baseline, due to cost.

3,Making a clock and I need a gear reduction of 1440:1. Is this possible?,1432207570,"Complete novice to engineering, so please forgive me if I'm approaching this from the wrong angle!

The weight of the hands rules out using a regular clock movement, so instead I think the solution is to use a 1rpm mirror-ball motor [(like this one)](http://www.electrosupplies.co.uk/product_info.php?products_id=6123&amp;src=2&amp;gclid=COSi1pzb0sUCFePItAodDDAAmA) and a set of gears to reduce the 1rpm input to a series of outputs for each hand, 0.000694rpm for the 24-hour hand (1440:1), 0.001389rpm for the 12-hour hand (720:1), 0.1667rpm for the minute-hand (60:1), 1rpm for the second hand, and so on.

Trying to find a solution to this problem has brought me to begin learning about gears and reductions, and it seems that a reduction of 1440:1 may be impossible (or incredibly complex and way beyond my capabilities).

11,Any Environmental Engineers that can help me understand wastewater treatment?,1432171071,"I'm studying for my exam. And as much as I read online guides and read educational books on the subject, I still get stumped on wastewater questions because it seems I really don't truly *understand* the concept behind all the processes.  
  
I understand the general gist of the treatment.   
  
1. There is an an aeration tank in which the microorganisms eat the food (organic material) and use DO in the process.  
  
2. Then that treated water goes into to a clarifier/settling tank.  There are microorganisms still left that settle out and that is called sludge?!  
  
3. And then some of the sludge is returned so that it can go into the aeration tank. Some of the sludge is wasted to prevent over-growth of microogranisms.   
  
I understand what goes on, but I get confused on the specific terminology.  
  
**Such as, what exactly is the sludge? Is it the microorganisms (Xa) and also some of the organic material (the food)? When you see an SS concentration in a problem, does that represent sludge as well? Or does SS (suspended solids) represent the food? So if you're given the SS concentration in the problem, what exactly does that represent? Then, you have another term that's sometime's given, the MLVSS (Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids), and from what I understand, that represents the concentration of  the microorganisms!?**
  
If anyone can answer the above questions that will be great. If you want to help me further, if you can take a stab at explaining the solution to the below problem, I would greatly appreciate it.   
  
----------------------------------------
  
This is a question that I don't understand the solution to, because I never know what concentration to use (the SS, the MLSS, the BOD). It's below.   

**An aeration basin for an activated-sludge facility has the following characteristics:**
 
Length = XX ft
Width = YY ft
Liquid depth = ZZ ft
MLSS = AA mg/L
 
The raw wastewater has the following characteristics:
 
Flow = BB MGD
BOD5 = CC mg/L
Suspended solids (SS) = FF mg/L
 
A primary clarifier is provided that removes X% of the BOD5 and Y% of the suspended solids. The return activated-sludge flow rate is GG MGD.
 
If the primary sludge solids content is N% solids and the specific gravity is 1.0, the primary sludge volume (ft3/day) is most nearly:  
  
  
**SO, in this problem, does the sludge volume refers to the suspended solids? Does the MLSS refer to the microorganisms in the tank? The BOD is a measure of how much organic material we have, I believe.**  
  
Solution BELOW  
  
-------  

**WEIGHT = ___ MGD X __ MG/L (SS concentration) X 8.34 ( Conversion factor to lbs) X Fractional Percentage**
  
Then you go on to solve for the total wet weight by dividing by the suspended solids percentage, and then find the volume by using the specific weight.  
  
**What I don't understand is...**  
  
1. Why we didn't take into account the flowrate of return sludge and find a total flow rate into the tank as 1.2+.8?
2. When we say that the clarifier removes 60% of solids, what does the word *removal* mean. Does that mean that 60% of the solids has settled into a sludge? Or does SS represent the food so that 60% was eaten by the microorganisms?
3. Why is the sludge only 4% solids? What else does the sludge consist of?
   
This is a very long question. But, I just can't seem to understand how to solve any waste-water questions by myself.

13,Heavy Concentrated Loading Scenario.,1432168093,"I'm trying to size the wheels for this structure. The wheels stay stationary on the ground and the platform rolls across the top. Finding 50kip capacity wheels is tricky/expensive so I want to see if I can use a different model to select a wheel with less capacity and know that it'll share the load with its neighbors. 

50,000lb Concentrated Weight Atop Structure that's supported on wheels. Imagine infinite length of the beam and infinite number of wheels, with spacing approximately equal to what's shown. Structure is made from heavy steel beams, something in the realm of 8"" to 12"" W beams.  It is presumed that the load is shared between multiple wheels in the scenario shown in picture 1 of the album.

http://imgur.com/a/QEswS

As the structure moves across the wheels, the weight rolls and passes so that it is potentially located directly atop a single wheel. This is a scenario that may remain as shown for extended periods of time. Will the central wheel deflect so as to share the load between the wheelsets nearby? Is this deflection something inherent to the wheel surface, or does it need to be in the design of the supports or wheel material? Or must we assume the wheel directly beneath must have capacity equal to the concentrated load and size as such?

Thoughts? Thanks in advance!

Edit: Should clarify, this is for a heavy welded steel platform that's used in an industrial environment. The wheels will likely be heavy steel wheels and will roll across a steel track, we can't really consider pneumatic tires.

I feel like my managers are micromanaging me, but I'm not sure what a good solution to the issue is, so I'd like some advice that I could propose to them.

I work for a small business with ~50 employees that employs two engineers, of which I am one.  I'm a mechanical engineer that works primarily in new product development, and mostly by myself.  My management tries to direct the work of my day-to-day, but they're not engineers, and they're simply not good at making design decisions.  Most often, they tell me to work on a solution they think will work, without telling me about the actual problem.  I try to respect their position and direction but this almost always leads to a lot of [wasted time and resources](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem).  I've asked them to just let me know what they want, and to let me make the design decisions, but it seems they rarely already know what they want.  And that's kind of understandable when you're making a new product.

My frustration rose recently when my company started reaching out to family members and consultants to help design my product, without consulting me.  I could use help finishing the line of products that I've finished vetting, but not in the ways they insist on trying to provide.  The suggestions of their consultants (and certainly family members) aren't very useful or helpful.  Many of these ""new"" suggestions are design decisions that I proposed earlier, but were shot down because management didn't think they were the right choice, though they accept them when a consultant or family member suggests them.  I do a lot of research, I work hard, I don't make suggestions unless I have a lot of confidence in them, and this makes me feel distrusted.

Even though I'm venting on reddit, I've discussed most of this already with my management.  They promised they would get out of the way and let me drive the product more in the direction I felt was strongest, but they hired a family member to manage my project within six weeks.  I don't understand their rationale.  I've been quite clear on what I think are already well-designed portions of the product, and which I could use help with, but they have only hired help where it isn't needed.

When my suggestions are steamrolled or overlooked, it undervalues what I enjoy most - actual engineering.

I do think I'm the person that needs to be managed - I work better when I'm held accountable.  That being said, their management style has been ineffective at making me be more effective.  I feel distrusted, underutilized in what I love doing, and not respected.

That seems a bit insane to me, but I don't have a thorough understanding of what how a cell constant should be used in selecting an appropriate conductivity probe for the range it operates in. I've tried searching around with Google to little avail. If someone could direct me to a document that covers this topic I would be very appreciative.


Edit: to clarify, I'm not looking for a good brand. I'm using Emerson probes because I already have their Rosemount multi-point analyzers.

29,Why is it taught to turn a torque wrench extension perpendicular to the torque wrench to eliminate any additional torque multiplication?,1432096163,"Basically, it is taught that if you use a torque wrench, and put an extension on it, you need to calculate the torque multiplier since you have lengthened the arm of the lever. However, it is also taught that if you turn the extension 90 degrees, then you have no longer need to calculate it. However, I have always questioned this teaching. I often get into arguments with people over this (especially being in aircraft maintenance, it makes me REALLY passionate about this!). I've seen it in books, and taught in classes. So please set me straight if I'm wrong, or if the world is. I would think that trigonometry plays a role in this, and the only way to eliminate the torque multiplier, is to make sure the distance from the center of your hand on the wrench, to the center of the fastener or bolt, is the same distance as from the center of your hand to the torque wrench drive.

Granted, I imagine there are a few factors that will skew this a little depending on the situation, but that, to me, seems it should be the rule of thumb.

I've only met a couple other people who agreed, but I've recently started questioning whether I am right or not. I could always set up a torque measurement experiment to verify, but I think it would be simpler to just ask some engineers!

30,Desalination modules... Deciding between thermal vs. RO in a unique application?,1432093752,"I've been presented with an interesting problem at work. I have a client in an area of the world (at 4600m asl) who is drilling exploration wells for geothermal energy. The wells they have drilled are extremely deep and have uncovered several sources of water at very high pressures and temperatures. The wells themselves are dug using a high pressure solution that dissolves the rockbed. By the time the water from the source reaches the surface, it is at atmospheric pressure and 80 degree C. The water is high in salts and silicates. 

Because water is extremely scarce to begin with in this area, and no grid electrical energy is available, the client wants to explore the possibility of reusing the water pumped out of these wells, filtering (UF) and desalinating it, and reusing it to drill other wells after it is made into drilling solution.

Reverse osmosis is a popular option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of using a thermal desalination technology to take advantage of the fact that the water is already coming out at 80 degree C (and thereby decreasing the delta T that a boiler would need to raise the temperature to) and because of the fact that RO is very energy-intensive due to high pressures needed in the membranes. The module would be producing ~50 GPM on average.

I see many many portable and containerized RO modules, but I don't see the same thing for any kind of thermal distillation (MSF: multi-stage flash, MED: multiple effect distillation, VCD: vapor compression distillation). Anyone have input into why this might be? I'm trying to find manufacturers (OEMs) that I could talk to about this and I am surprised at how little information I am finding.

Could it work to build a trainset that filled up the entire tube, where cars were weighted at the bottom and free to swivel/rotate as they banked around curves? The tube could be lined with bearings or rollers (or somesuch) to make the passage low-friction, and propulsion could be provided by, say, rubber wheels around the perimeter of the car pushing against the tunnel wall.

So far, I tried using a xenon flash tube, which worked fine, but I need more light. However, as the output power grows, [they get pretty big](http://www.xenonflashtubes.com/strobe.html). Worse than the size of the tube itself, if I want to build a proper reflector for it, it'll get beyond the reasonable size limits fairly quickly. Ideally, I would want to have a point source that I could put into the focus of a parabolic reflector. Thus, I was wondering if it's possible to get something as bright as xenon tubes, but smaller. I was thinking about electric arc in the air or an inert gas under the atmospheric pressure, and if it actually helped, I'd be fine with periodically replacing the electrodes. However, I couldn't find good data on how much light I can get from that.

First off, feel free to send me elsewhere if you feel I am in the wrong place—I have a very unconventional project to ask you about. 

I’m a graduate student biologist running cognition experiments with bats, and I am looking for advice about how to build a vertical maze contraption that will fit my needs. It needs to be reasonably low budget (see, graduate student), and durable, as I do my work in the tropics. I am having a hard time figuring out what materials to use and how to design it. Here is an extremely rough [picture]( http://imgur.com/3ScMj4e) of what I am imagining: 

Basically, the animal will be put into the top, and then will crawl down the sides. When it reaches the arms, it will make a choice, and if it crawls to the bottom of the ‘correct arm’ it will find a food reward, and I will open the bottom and allow it to crawl or fly out. 

I am hoping to make something that is very versatile. In particular, I want to be able to make it deeper or shallower to be appropriate for species of different sizes, perhaps by having a front that can detach and ‘snap’ in closer or further away from the from the back.  I also want to be able to snap in and out different modules along the insides of each arm, like lights, or visual patterns.  The front needs to be at least semi transparent, so that I can observe the bat, and I need to be able to slide in doors to keep the bat in an arm once it makes a choice. The back needs to be at least covered in mesh, so that the bat can grip  it comfortably. I would also like to be able to attach a feeding platform at the bottom.

What do you think would be flexible building material that could use to make this design? What sort of fastenings can I use to change the depth of the walls, and to plug in light modules?

68,What's the best way to monitor the rotational speed of a motor?,1431957535,"Hi there,

I'm constructing a gyroscope which comprises of a hard disk motor mounted on a central gimbal, within an outer gimbal on a frame. The hard disk motor receives power through the frame itself but due to imperfections in the conductivity of the frame, sometimes the speed of the motor can be heard to drop. I want to be able to monitor the speed of the motor with the potential implementation of a system that regulates the voltage to the motor to maintain constant speed.

I have looked at using microphones and piezo sensors and accelerometers, and so far have ruled out accelerometers as they tend not to be sensitive enough to pick up the vibrations of the frame. 

Are there any better ways of going about this? Or is my best bet just using a microphone and spectrally analysing the sound? I have an Arduino Due at my disposal for inputting analog and digital signals.

I am not an engineer, but I think I know enough to make a simple press using lever action and a pulley system. If I did my math right, the lever system in my sketch should increase the pressure on the press by 3x. Using an 8-1 pulley system, this should generate an overall force of 24x the force on the pulley rope. I would like a 50 kg force to generate a 1200 kg down force on the press. Is my math correct?

But, it's really hard to tune (since I can't be sure the model is right), and it seems like there are more tunables than necessary.

My gut says knowing the natural frequency and Q-factor ought to be all I need.  Ideally, I could drive the voltage to one rail to accelerate the needle, and then to the other rail to decelerate it, then to the target.   If it were timed just right, it could be very fast with no overshoot.

Hey /r/AskEngineers 

As a software engineer by profession and hobby, I have a pretty good grasp on most of what goes on in building a software system. And as a game engine programmer, I have also some pretty decent knowledge about how such programs / systems run on the deeper levels, down to the hardware, electronics &amp; electric impulses that light up LEDs on displays and push sound waves out of the speakers

However, outside the field of software engineering (and perhaps marginally electronics) I don't really have any much knowledge

Now if I look at all the fantasized versions / heroic engineers I like (Tony Stark, TF2 Engineer, [Mark Watney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28Weir_novel%29)) I find my lack of actual skills outside of the field of software disappointing

I may be able to program Jarvis, but I wouldn't know how to build the suit. I maybe be able to program the turret, but I won't be able to build the turret itself. And yes, I may be able to repair the ship systems &amp; run diagnostics, maybe write new navigation code, but I won't be able to fix anything else. You get the trend

So what 'General Knowledge' engineering books would you recommend from your field (or that you have cross read)?

Preferred topics:

* How to design a killer drone / turret &amp; build it
* How to design a house / shelter &amp; build it
* How to design an off road buggy / fix its motor
* How to build a spaceship
* How to design a submarine

Of course, the books don't have to be exclusive to these topics. Just anything about Engineering other than software / computer parts and that would not require a BSc before attempting to read

*Note: I do know most of these come like requests from a 12 year old. But I guess... if I had ever grown up, would I be making video games for a living? :)*

Hello,

I am trying to design a wireless-power-transmission device for my final exams. [This is the design so far](http://i.imgur.com/CCF3DXm.png), the transistor is IRF2807 and the diode something else. The voltage we used was 15V max.

Obviously, it does not work. The teacher who I am working on this with says that we need both more power and more number of loops in the coil. However, I think that we need to get the receiving circuit to resonate.

From this, is it correct to use the resonant frequency of LC to find out the capacitance of a capacitor, given that we know the inductance of the coil?

EDIT1:

I went ahead and did some calculations.

Given the suggestion of /u/JohnnyThree that I should use radio frequencies, the target frequency is 30kHz, for now.

I ""took"" a copper wire with the lenght of 17m and cross section of 1mm^2. [Made a solenoid](http://i.imgur.com/rFrxilw.png) and then used the equation

(U/I) = 2 * Pi * f * L

and now when I take the voltage of e.g. 10V, I will get the current of 0.033 A, which seems incredibly low, to me at least. [I am not sure which voltage should I pick](http://i.imgur.com/YAlptNM.png), the max V of the coil oscillation, not the square ones, correct?

Now, if this were through, to get the other coil, I would use the resonance frequency equation, get a smaller coil, a transistor and make it again to 30kHz.

9,Can a Cummins CNG engine be made to run on compressed hydrogen?,1431725136,"I'm in the market for a school bus to modify, and while I currently have plans for a vegetable oil conversion, I've been seeing some buses with CNG (methane-powered) Cummins engines, and that's got me thinking.

Now, before I start getting booed, I know that running a vehicle on hydrogen generated from engine power is bullocks. This bus would have an on-board hydrogen generator, but that generator would be powered by solar and/or shore power when plugged in. (The generated gas would then be compressed, cooled, and stored for use as fuel.) I know the energy has to come from somewhere; it would come from solar panels and/or an electric outlet.

But... can an engine designed to run on CNG instead run on hydrogen? I'm sure it would suffer from reduced power and fuel economy if it did, but could it run at all? (I might keep a CNG tank on board as well, to be used as a supplement when extra power is needed.)

The question, though, is: Could it work? What kinds of modifications might the engine need to work well on hydrogen? Would it be better to store the compressed hydrogen and oxygen together in one tank, or should I keep them separate until ready to burn, or maybe just vent the oxygen and use only a mix of hydrogen and outside air to burn? Are there any online sources to research this kind of conversion? -- I can't find anything about it.

(Yes, I could make my own methane to run it on... but that's a lot messier, and it's not something I would want to do on-board. I'd rather go with the original veggie oil plan than use a methane-generating system.)

I basically take SEM images of semiconductor wafers and send to our customers that are process engineers. Now, I find myself very limited (cannot move up in position) in the industry with only a B.S. in Materials Science. I am located in Silicon Valley btw.

My main goal is to work for one of the big tech companies like Google, Apple, Intel, etc.. on electronic devices (iPhone, iWatch, iPad, Macbooks)..but most positions at Apple related to this require a Masters or Ph.D. So, now I am considering to learn Apple's new programming language ""Swift"" and become a programmer instead. 
I am deciding to switch because in college I had to decide between Materials Science or Computer Science. I went with Computer Science. Now, I want to learn programming on the side while working full-time to develop skills using the new langauge ""Swift"".

My question is:
Is it a big disadvantage for me as a Materials Science major to apply for a Computer Science position? How do I stand out?

-My solution is to learn Swift and publish some apps to the App Store and put on my resume

40,Ultrasonic velocity testing on rock core (ASTM-2845): Seeking advice on signal filtering,1431543705,"I have recently obtained an [ultrasonic pulse velocity machine with 200 kHz transducers](http://www.gcts.com/?s=prod_ver&amp;p=products&amp;ID=65) from GCTS Testing Systems to test rock core for dynamic moduli of elasticity. While I understand how to operate the machine and take a signal of the rock core, interpreting that signal has been a hair-pulling experience for myself and a teammate who has been working with me to figure out this device. Does anyone have any experience in operating this type of device?  
&amp;nbsp;  
First and foremost, we've tried seeking help from the company to no avail.  
We've had about a dozen rock samples sent out to an external lab to have them tested so that we'd have numbers to compare to and learn from. As I said, receiving a quality signal doesn't appear to be an issue. We know how to interpret the compression wave. Here is an example of a raw shear wave signal I've taken:  
&amp;nbsp;  
[Raw Signal](http://i.imgur.com/jyXwSv9.jpg)  
&amp;nbsp;  
Unfortunately, when we asked this lab for advice on performing the test, we discovered that the lab uses an oscilloscope instead of the static pulse image our machine provides so any advice given to us didn't seem to translate. We started seeing what we assumed as a pattern in this lab's selection process based on signals we've received on our own machine but once we started fiddling with the filter, it seemed like we could make the signal look any way we want.  
&amp;nbsp;  
[Signal passed through various filters](http://i.imgur.com/Z5z5u2L.jpg)  
&amp;nbsp;  
Rectangular or Blackman  
Chebyshev or Butterworth  
Bandpass at 400kHz to 500kHz or 100 kHz to 200 kHz  
&amp;nbsp;

52,"[Hydrology] Pump stop, water hammer and backflow",1431518460,"Hello. I'm looking at a system where I'm pumping water(sewage) out into the ocean. The system goes: pump ---&gt; tank ---&gt; pipe ---&gt; ocean. The water in the tank has the same elevation as the ocean. If the pump suddenly stops(f.ex. loss of electricity), the water in the pipe still has some momentum and some of the water will still leave the pipe and go into the ocean(thus lowering the water level in the tank). That will make a difference in water levels between the tank and the ocean as there is water leaving the tank through the pipe but not coming in. The pressure from the ocean would then force a backflow into the tank.

How do I calculate how much water leaves the pipe? I know the diameter of the pipe and water velocity in the pipe(when the pump is running). How quickly does the water in the pipe go from v=1,2 m/s to v=0 m/s?

I've tried searching but all the information I find is about water hammer and what happens downstream in the pipe when a pump is shut down or valves closed, I'm having a really hard time finding anything about water leaving pipes with momentum only.

I've tried this: http://excelcalculations.blogspot.com/2011/12/dynamic-liquid-flow-between-coupled.html method but it is missing the factor that the water is already flowing with some velocity and momentum in one direction.

61,Can I use welding rod to make springs?,1431477648,"I am finishing up my senior design project and we need high temperature springs. Currently we are using steel springs from Grainger.

We have some Inconel welding rods leftover from our build though. I don't think that have any sort of flux coating either. It looks like raw Inconel.

I was able to wind up some just to see if it could hold its shape. It looks decent enough but I think I've cold working it a little much because it just plastically deform at certain angles that the other spring can withstand.

I have read that Inconel can be heat treated at 1700 C then air quenched to help relieve the cold working and make the spring perform well at temperatures over 700 C.

First of all, how do you air quench or cool something rapidly without oil or water.

Second, would this even work? We just need to springs to be able to keep their torque at decently high temperature for about 25 minutes. It doesn't have to be perfect. The steel springs actually relaxed and now apply their torque in the opposite direction with our current setup.

I'm a recent high school grad trying to decide on which engineering program I should accept.

64,"Does such a device exist that can monitor multiple (12+) digital inputs, and control a time delayed output based on those inputs?",1431469747,"G'day,

I have a series of rooms that need to be within a specific temperature range. They have their own controls per room which bring on an alarm if they go outside of this temperature range. This alarm works as expected. So far, no problem.

The trouble is that they require power to operate, and when power is lost (or the control fails in a lightning strike for example) the alarm never activates.

I've added a mechanical thermostat to each room and run them in parallel to an electronic timer. If any room triggers, it initiates a time delay and then operates the alarm. As backup, I've wired the alarm over a N/C set of contacts so when the power goes out, the alarm (which is covered by a UPS setup) comes on by default. This works great as a backup and has paid for itself multiple times already.

The trouble I have is that because the time delay is cumulative over all rooms, the alarm can be triggered if multiple rooms in succession go outside of the temperature range. It's totally normal for a room to go above/below temp for brief periods, it's only when it's a few hours at a time that it's an issue. With multiple rooms getting too hot for a brief period (30 minutes, say) in succession, the 2 hour time delay is reached without there actually being a fault.

What I'd like to do is find a control that can monitor 12+ binary inputs (mechanical thermostats that simply open or close a circuit based on temperature), and trigger an output only if one of those inputs has been activated continuously for 2 hours. If a series of rooms triggers in succession, it ignores the cumulative total.

Does such a thing exist?

71,Are fresnel lenses and steam power a viable sustainable energy solution?,1431458719,"I have no engineering background, but I remember a thing or two about energy from high school physics.

I've seen all sorts of videos on the internet of large inexpensive lenses (called fresnel lenses) being employed to melt padlocks and stacks of coins by focusing sunlight.  [Here](https://youtu.be/jrje73EyKag) is one such video.  The effect is pretty immediate (and even dangerous).

Some people out there have used their fresnel lenses to power small stirling engines (compressed air).  [Here](https://youtu.be/CDCTANU8Tfk?t=30s) is one such video.  After searching, I [found a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/mw41h/can_we_consider_a_fresnel_lenses_stirling_engines/) in this subreddit which pretty much explains that a stirling engine/fresnel lens setup would not be viably sustainable for many technical and practical reasons.  Unfortunately, this did not answer my question.

My question is:  Could a fresnel lens/**steam** engine be viable as a sustainable consumer energy solution?

The way I understand it, nuclear energy is pretty much just steam energy when all is said and done.  The nuclear fuel rods discharge ionizing radiation in water until the water boils, produces steam, the steam moves a turbine, the turbine does a bunch of cool engineering stuff, and then I get power, right? Something like that?

So why can't I use a fresnel lens to boil that water instead?

I understand that it is not so simple, and that I am talking about some pretty major, expensive infrastructure changes which would need to take place.  But what if the whole process was scaled down to serve a single-family home, to be operated on-site?  What if said home also employed solar panels to further supplement power?  Solar energy is quite developed and is still developing, especially considering dramatic, novel market implications such as the Tesla powerwall.  Could such home power storage technology be employed using a fresnel lens and steam power?

I am not well-informed about these kinds of things, which is why I turn to you fine people.

81,Can a car accelerate without wheel slip?,1431437305,"I am confused about acceleration in a car. Is it possible for a car to accelerate without wheel slip? I know that a wheel doesn't slip when the force due to engine torque is smaller than the static friction force between wheel and road. But can force to accelerate be transmitted without slipping of the wheels?  
According to this curve it can't: [Force vs slip](http://www.asawicki.info/Mirror/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games_files/ctsrcurve.gif)

83,Question about how to solve a flooding problem,1431421061,"Hi, I didnt know where to put the question, but i thought AskEngineers is a good place as any.  My hometown is in the state of Kerala in India. I stay close to the coast, and there is a railway track running through my village. There are pathways and crossings across this track used to get from one side to the other. One of these crossings, is an underpass to allow small vehicles to go through , it could probably fit one regular car. It was initially designed only for people, but after some negotations, they increased the height of the underpass by doing some digging, to allow vehicles to move through. Now the issue is during the rains, as the depth is much lower than previously planned, the water does not flow out as needed, and forms a large pool, which causes a lot of inconvenience for people to go through it. 

There are small canals built almost 10 metres away, to facilitate flow of water which builds up during the rainy season. 

Of what I could find while searching online, there are underground pumps that can be setup with a water level, to automatically start when the water level reaches a point. Power could be supplied using solar cells with a battery pack. The water could then be pumped from the underpass to the canal and reduce the water level to a more comfortable level. 

My concerns with this idea are as follows:
1. Would solar cells be suitable in the rainy season, which is usually when this problem happens?
2. What kind of storage is efficient and suitable for this scenario?
3. How can I protect this setup from being misused or even stolen?
4. Is there a similar setup in other regions, and how have they overcome the practical issues of setting this up?

86,How do you deal with management treating engineers as interchangeable?,1431405422,"I'm starting to get into the project management side of things, and I'm starting to notice that some of the systems engineers treat engineers in my company as fairly interchangeable.  They'll completely ignore what skills, education, and background a person has, and pick a person ""because he's in my division"", or some bullshit like that.  

At times, it gets really ridiculous - for instance they'll try to assign a mechanical engineer to be an RF designer on a project, to give them ""breadth"", despite having RF engineers available.
