0,Is getting a Master's in Computer Engineering worth it?,1600281552,"Hello everyone! I hope you are having a great Wednesday because I know I am not. I am currently a Junior at a Top 20 American University studying Computer Engineering with a minor in General Business.   


I wanted to ask if it is worth me staying back and completing my Master's (in Computer Engineering) from the same University, finish my Undergraduate degree and work, or something else. I am honestly torn about this, and do not know which path is right for me. I don't want to waste 1.5-2 years when I could have been making money or vice versa. The cost of education is not an issue. Also, I have had no prior work experience/internship experience as of now, but subs like this keep me motivated and inspired :)

1,Determining Custom PC Build Specs for My Needs,1600279145,"If this is the wrong sub let me know, its the only one I subscribe to that it really fits with.

I'm considering building a PC, but I have no idea how to determine what I need.  I can obviously go with the top of the line, maxed out everything, but my wallet isn't that big.  How do I translate my requirements to specifications for a PC build?

For example, if I want to have several applications running at once, what do I need to know about those applications and how do I convert that knowledge into a specification that I can use when shopping for components?

3,Trainee positions - Is it all just paper shuffling?,1600277547,"Late 20s industrial Eng. From northern EU here. I graduated a year ago and got a trainee position at a global manufacturing company. I get to try 3 different departments in the company for 6 months each, totalling 18 months as a trainee and ending with an offer for a suitable position. during the whole period I get paid a salary. Even though during this pandemic I feel very lucky I got to keep my position... Most of the time during the past year I feel like I've wasted my time.

Basically I've been jumping from project to project supporting with admin engineering work at best. Most of the time I have just been 'tagging along for the ride' and given tasks that are later forgotten or not valued. The excuse has been "" well your only here for 6 months, what do you expect?"" 

I get this is part of the whole 'first year at the job you don't provide anything useful anyway' but now when I'm 6 months away from getting a 'real position' I'm terrified I'll be placed on a desk to shuffle papers all day.

As guessed this wasn't what I signed up for when starting this trainee position... They said I'd be part of a select few who'd get to gain rapid experience and a foot up into leadership positions faster than my peers. Yet now it looks like this 18-month trainee program has instead set me back 18 months and I should have just started a normal job from the start.

I was just wondering what is  standard for this kind of work. Is this unusual? This isn't for defense  or anything critical, just a small &lt;20 people hardware startup. Even  so, I don't know if I'm comfortable sitting in a LabCorp waiting room  for 2 hours, seems like not the place to be during a pandemic.

8,Just a venting CS grad,1600268746,"It's not popular to play the victim when concerning one's carrier but, there is a sense of needing a therapeutic moment of weakness in all this. Whether anyone reads this (due to its length), it feels good to put it all out there.      
That being said, my post:   
I've grown up in a small town in Missouri, the bastard son of a signal teenage mother who never married my father.  I'm in my mid-30s and thus was born in a time when deadbeat dads could get away with not paying child support, mine never did. We were poor. Add to that a string of drug issues my mother had in my early life and you can begin to understand how I and my half-brother found our way into the care of DFS. By the end of that, I would be taken in by my grandmother. My bother, on the other hand, wouldn't be my brother anymore (given up for adoption).   

  
My grandparents weren't like my mother ( who would later go to college and improve), they were hard-working upright middle-class folks. They raised me, as essentially, their third child.  I would eventually come to live with my mother again. Now improved she had an associate's degree and a job, but still couldn't make enough money to support us.    

  
It had become apparent that I struggled in school and so a round of progressive actions was taken. LD classes were followed by DB ones, and finally, the IEP's. These were seen as a good thing at the time, a way of lowering the standards for those children who couldn't ""keep up.""  What it really meant was that I was learning pre-algebra as a jr in high-school.   
Somewhere in the mix, I was put on minor disability by my mother, who despite me saying it was shameful, saw it was a way to supplement our low income and make a better life for me. I told myself at the time that I wouldn't stay on it after I became an adult, but when the time came, the security of it was too much to give up. I'm not proud of it, but there it is.  

   
I stayed on the check until 23 when a drunken fight on someone else's property landed me in jail. Although no one was really hurt I pled guilty to 2nd-degree assault (in MO a non-expugnable crime) in exchange for getting to go home that day and walking 3 years probation. I've never been drunk or violent before in my life, but, the one place I messed up would end up following me for the rest of my life.

     
When I began to explore how to rebuild my life I found most things out of reach. Felons, I learned cannot hold office, be a lawyer, work in the medical field, etc. One thing I kept coming back to was computer science, however.  I was told time and again that CS was the way to go if you had a record. That field was in such demand that many companies couldn't afford to care too much.   With all of my learning issues, I poured myself into learning this stuff. I started again at basic math and worked my way up ( as a grown man) to calculus. I did whatever I had to do to pass my classes. In this time I met the love of my life, inherited a home, and thought I was working my way toward something, a real life. It has taken me 7 years to get a 4 year CS degree.   
Now, the year of graduation, I find that my education has not given me everything I need.  I've no working knowledge of React, Angular, or really any framework outside of .net. I've no portfolio, nor the knowledge of Git or modern frameworks to make one. It would take me months or weeks to learn even one of these frameworks enough to make me competitive and even then, my age and record conspire against me. 

 COVID has robbed me of the one job I had (a web dev for a very small company), destroyed the economy that made me even remotely hirable, and now, my grandfather (essentially my father) lays dying of the same illness in the ICU.  To make matters worse, I now see that there is very little in this town for me. I, a diabetic, live in a hotspot area. And the board of health tried to pass a simple mask mandate last night, only to be met by throngs of protesting anti-maskers. Living in fear of my neighbors and the virus is not the way I want to live.  

 My dream? Go to Colorado. They have a 7-year rule there, and my record won't be such a big deal. Of course, to go I would need a job, and to get one I'd have to be competitive.  Which, I'm not.  The whole thing is just so much. Such a long journey and I'm still not even close to where I want to be. I'm tired...The whole mountain just seems far too high to climb.  It really hurts to know I've come all this way only to fail. To be in my mid-30's, have no children (because I didn't want them to be poor like me), and to realize that because I can't find a good job I likely never will. I've failed my wife and myself.

23,"Using a motor to generate electricity, school project",1600259096,"Hello everyone!

I'm really stuck on a project. The project is to create a playset in which people can generate electricity by playing (for example an electricity-generating swing).

&amp;#x200B;

 We have the idea to make a human-sized hamster wheel in which you can run all your frustrations or energy away. The problem that we face right now, is how we are going to turn a circular motion into energy. The budget we have for the entire project is about 500-600 euros, and my current idea is to use a small motor as a generator, but I've run into a gigantic wall here.

&amp;#x200B;

What would be a good choice for a motor? We need to be able to charge 2 devices with the electricity generated, and it would be optimal if any excess energy would be stored in a battery. The speed at which the hamster wheel would be about the running speed of a person minus some losses because you're rotating a giant wheel (about 10-15km/h). I was thinking about using a solar charge controller because it already has connection points for a battery and 2 USB ports for standard charging. The solar charge controller has a system voltage of 12-24V, and I have zero to none knowledge about electrical circuits. I know that the wheel wouldn't be rotating at a constant speed every time it's being used, so I have no idea what motor I'd need for this. Does anyone know what motor would be good for this purpose, and if this motor would be able to supply enough power for the solar charge controller to function properly? And would a solar charge controller be able to stabilize the fluctuating produced energy coming in so it's suitable for charging?

31,What skills to develop during PhD for medical device R&amp;D?,1600248672,"Hello everyone,

I'm 24, based in the UK (but willing to relocate), and currently doing a PhD in (Medical) Robotics, after a BSc and MSc in Biomedical Engineering. I'm 1.5 years in with 2 years left, and I'd like to get a job in R&amp;D in the medical device industry afterwards.

Does anyone know what kind of skills I should be developing during the remaining time that would help this happen?

&amp;#x200B;

**A bit of background:**

The reason I went for a PhD in the first place was that after finishing my MSc I felt that I did not have what recruiters were looking for and couldn't get anything else other than Quality, Consulting, or Software support (and indeed the vast majority of my colleagues at the time are working in one of these three roles in completely unrelated, or only slightly related, industries). 

My main goal for my PhD was to get some research experience while learning skills that I hadn't learnt during my BSc and MSc. I ended up deciding for a PhD in Robotics given the interdisciplinary nature of the field and was lucky enough to find a good opportunity in a big multidisciplinary project for a surgical robot.

So, up until now the main focus of my research has been on materials, fabrication and design (so lots of CAD, 3D Printing, moulding, mechanical testing, etc...); skills, which to some extent, I already had gained during my MSc final project. Nonetheless, I've learnt quite a lot, and am a lot more comfortable in these areas than when I started.

During this time, on the side (and should be the main focus from now on) I've been working on the sensing side of the robot (so some skills in circuit design, state observers, modelling etc...).

I was wondering if anyone has any advice on other skills that I should be focusing on, possibly more medical device related than these general engineering skills.",AskEngineers,False,bananachocolatecake,/r/AskEngineers/comments/itsajo/what_skills_to_develop_during_phd_for_medical/

41,ME starting a Project Engineer position. What is Project Engineering like?,1600223172,"Recently completed a Mechanical Engineering BS. I've been offered and have accepted a position with a construction company as a Mechanical Project Engineer. As an ME, I've been conditioned to think of construction positions as the places where my dreams go to die. I've obviously gotten over this attitude in the last year or so, and I'm excited to start my new position, but I know almost nothing about construction. I feel confident that I can fulfill the listed duties of the position (otherwise I wouldn't have applied), and I made it clear in both interviews I did with the company that I know almost nothing about construction and have only a vague idea of what a Project Engineer does. They told me this wasn't a problem, I'd be working under a Project Manager and with other PEs and training me on the job basically from scratch was expected.  


&amp;#x200B;

I have a broad idea of what PEs do from google and from asking questions in the interview, and some of the more ""paperwork-y"" aspects of the job are familiar to me from previous work I did in the military (i.e. maintaining and updating logs, preparing work orders, project status reports, liaising between departments). I'd like to ask some questions directly of any Project Engineers who may come across this post that are more specific to the construction field:  


&amp;#x200B;

\- What's an average day for an entry-level Project Engineer like? What sort of tasks are most common? What are some less common tasks that are considered very important to look out for?

\- What does it mean to review and evaluate a submittal? Is this just a cursory glance of drawings and spec sheets, or something more involved?

I'm looking for advice.

I have followed a very secure path -- graduated from a top 5 mechanical engineering school and directly hired into a top aerospace company, where I've been for the past year. I thought I was hired into my dream job, but working as a design engineer in a cubicle farm makes me feel like my brain is atrophying. Working in defense as I have become more firm in my values of non-violence makes me feel icky as well. When I look around my current workplace, I'm not excited by the job that anyone around me has. I want something closer to full-brain (analytical + creative) problem-solving in my every day, for a problem that matters. I'm frustrated that engineering is so revered in society, but so far it feels like my skills are being wasted and I'm creating something bad for the world.

I don't know where to start in this search for better purpose in engineering.

I'm wondering if graduate school would help. I had an interest in controls in college but was told this field may be too ""deep"" for my liking. I'm a people person who wants to use my brain on good technology.

49,Move from visual effects to engineering?,1600214502,"Hi, I've recently seen some bits and pieces on Reddit and other places that have got me seriously considering a move from my current career to solve form of engineering. I currently work in visual effects further north in the UK and am on £22K in my second year out of uni. It's okay but I don't enjoy it as much as I think I should. (I don't think it's an issue with the company as they seem to be one of the best I've seen for our industry - other than pay)

I've always been torn between engineering and visual effects as I grew up but ended up settling for VFX. After seeing what people make straight out of uni and a few years down the line makes my salary seem like peanuts.

My second reason is that my current career is actually very restricting in terms of locations. If I want to live and work somewhere there needs to be a VFX company there willing to hire me. With engineering it seems pretty universal. In the future I'm considering moving to New Zealand (have citizenship) but there are very few pieces for VFX, and the big famous one (Weta) seem very picky about who they hire. There is the freelance side but I've heard that to be an absolute nightmare.

I very nearly ended up in electrical engineering and still enjoy it as a hobby (very low level). And also software engineering (again very low level at the moment). It's the problem solving aspect I enjoy most which I get to do a lot less often here than I expected.

My main questions here are:
1. If you happen to be familiar with both industries, do you think there are any transferrable skills that would mean I'm not starting from scratch
2. Should I wait it out a couple more years and see how things go?

I currently know a bit of Matlab, C++, and currently trying to become proficient in Python by taking a ton of online courses since my school doesn't offer anything for Python.

Most importantly, I actually do it. I researched all sorts of cameras from still digital cameras, dedicated cinema cameras, and industrial high speed cameras. They're all out of curiosity.

Observations include:

* Most high speed cameras have smaller pixels and sensors than the Canon ME20F-SH yet deliver higher starting ISO. The Canon ME20F-SH starts at ISO 800.
* All the modern full frame cameras (excluding A7S line) and often the crop frame DSLRs have smaller pixels and better low light performance than the Canon EOS-1Ds from 2002.
* The Nikon D3 lags behind the Sony A7S yet they have the same megapixel count.
* The Phase One P65+ lack the high ISO performance of full frame cameras from the same time period. This is despite the same pixel size and smaller recording areas than the P65+
* Cameras with two base ISOs deliver almost as good performance at the latter base ISO.

I speculated the downstream design is the real primary cause of bad low light performance. The problem is all the sources I found claim it's primarily on insufficient photon collection, small pixels, and small sensors all contribute to poor low light performance.

85,"[Career] Sort of venting, but looking for some input what you would do in my shoes? Lots of text, but a TLDR included.",1600184305,"Hello everyone!  (TL;DR at the bottom)

I just want to get my thoughts out, and see if anyone else has been through something similar in a professional setting.  

I started my ""engineering"" career around 2012. I use the term engineer loosely as I'm actually not sure how I would classify myself. I design all my own parts from scratch, do my own drawings, pick my own materials, all that jazz...but I don't have an engineering degree. I guess a designer?  

Anyhow, I graduated from ITT Tech in 2013 with an associates in Drafting and Design. We all know the cluster that came to light with that school so it is what it is. Since I graduated I've only worked for 2 companies. I'm going to be very generic here:

Company #1: I was actually working on the factory floor as a machine op for a few years before going to school. When I was about half way through school, the owner let me move into the office as a designer. It's a small company (maybe 40 employees over 3 states), but fast paced. Everything is a custom one-off design and turn around times for quoting are guaranteed in 24 hours.

Company #2: I was part of a ""sustaining engineering"" team. We were the problem solvers and the draftsmen for both electrical and mechanical engineers. We made they're drawings, rough designed parts to get quick quoted and then they took over when the project became ""real"". We worked very close with the production floor and handled anything that wasn't matching the MFR released drawing and handled every single ECO that came through. It was only me and one other guy in the department, so we were always busy.

Well, company #2 started going down hill quickly. They were going though a buy out when I decided to jump ship and was er-hired at company #1 back in 2016. I kept in contact with a few people from there and I made the right decision. They downsized a LOT and let about 70% of the employees go from that location (only location in the state).

The last few years have been both good and bad for me. Where I currently work, company #1, I love it here but there have been some hiccups. Since I've worked here for a total of around 8 years (between design work and machine op work), I know a *ton* about the company and the processes. I make good money for what I do. But I always want more responsibility, and there isn't much to give since we're a small company. 

Lately I've been feeling mundane about coming to work. Like most we took a hit with COVID and it got slow. Most days I'm lucky to design 2 or 3 parts, when pre-covid we were pumping out upwards of 10 a day. I've worked for this company a long time. In many different areas. I've actually worked here 3 separate times. I won't lie, every time I left it was always for more money (and experience). If I decide to leave again...I fully expect to never come back. 

All that being said, here's where the issue lies. I know this is not my dream job. My dream job would be for Milwaukee Tools. I'm not sure why, but that's where I want to be. Product/mechanical designing there. I actually did apply for an entry level position there awhile back hoping that I could lean more so on my experience rather than schooling, but that was a dead end. They want a bachelors in engineering. Now, I started this buy saying I graduated from ITT. Years ago I was tossing around the idea of going back to school and actually becoming a real degreed engineer. What I learned was: ITT was not accredited. I have to start all the way over. I'm only 29, so I know I have time, but that was almost a kill shot for me. I'm $35,000 in debt to a school that doesn't even exist anymore. I want a change in my life, but I'm terrified. I have a wife, a daughter, and a new house. Back when I was looking at doing school I was told my bachelors would take something like 9 years (part time classes).

TL;DR:  
ITT graduate. Want to be a real engineer. Have to start school 100% over since ITT wasn't accredited. Not working at my ""dream job"".

86,Am I hurting my career with my current job?,1600182970,"I had a job lined up for May graduation this year but then COVID hit and I lost all job offers that I had. On top of that I now need to retake a class(one of my big concerns is that I don't technically have my degree one class short that I'm taking online now and employers don't like that). 

After I was on the job search for a couple months I landed my current position that I really enjoy. I work from home right now talk with customers and come up with automation solutions for them. I love the field I'm in but I've go concerns about this job. It's a small company and I'm starting to think that since I've worked remotely my boss has been lying to me about just how small we are. I'm starting to think that I might be one of less than 5 engineers. It's difficult not having any mentors and not a ton of experience either. 

The thing is the the paychecks keep coming and I'm getting work doing things I enjoy. The concern comes from the companies future. We're planning to go public along with a ton of other plans that my boos has laid out. My boss say that we've got lots of funding and has big plans but I'm not sure if it's all talk. There just doesn't seem to be much structure within the company. I would like to tell my boss to do a number of things that I think will benefit and grow the company but I don't think I'm in the position to being new and working remotely.

I've been debating about looking for jobs elsewhere as I'm kept in the dark about certain things and don't have a ton of control working remotely. Is there anything wrong with sticking it out to see if I can help make the company work? I figure that being young it's an excuse to take a gamble and with COVID everyone's not doing so well now and no one is hiring anyways.

After realizing I had a knack for software my manager moved me to a struggling software team where I took on a lot of responsibility and taught myself full stack cloud software development. The lead left and I took on his responsibility. I helped transition the team from a few contractors to 15 in-house devs. I was not old enough or had enough seniority (only 3 years at the time) to be promoted to a manager or a lead so I just act as a consultant to the team, which is managed by someone else. The team could not function without me since I'm the only domain expert.

7,Clarification about drafting? Is it obsolete?,1600145659,Hi everyone I'm wondering if I could get some clarification. I've been looking into drafting for some time but I hear from people that it's an obsolete profession. Now this is because I was told by two men who are Civil engineers that it's not needed anymore and when I was looking into the Navy they used to have a military job for draftsman but not anymore sadly. Than with all that said a drafting school in my area says that there are plenty of jobs for drafters. I really don't know what to think or believe and am hoping I could please get some explaination. Thanks everyone and I really appreciate it very much!,AskEngineers,False,NicholasMarsala,/r/AskEngineers/comments/it22wn/clarification_about_drafting_is_it_obsolete/
8,can you modify pelican cases?,1600143637,"I am horrible with woodworking (building something out of wood to make my own case). I tried making my own plywood box, but between lowes not being able to cut square right, and me not being able to cut a straight line with a circular saw, I can't get a square box. (Make a jig I suppose to help square it up at this point? but then need latches and the ones I bought are wide enough, the list goes on with my failures and I am literally losing sleep over this what was a fun project).

that being said, I need a case and the pelican iM2620 fits my dimensions almost exactly. I need to use a  jigsaw and cut holes in the top lid for two PTZ like cameras (mounted upside down), seal them for water tightness to the case lid, electronics inside, power outlet on the side. I need to mount two wifi radios on the side along with a cat6 plate. This will sit stationary outside 24x7 and will be in the weather.

I read that modifying pelican cases is not a good idea, but for those use cases, I could see their points. But the lid being too flexible to even seal after the holes are cut is a question I still have.

ney? yey? Back to woodworking 101 for me? Maybe another brand that may fit this type of work I have in mind?

26,Trouble negotiating with HR for higher salary,1600127585,"Background: 

I graduated with my Masters in Materials Science and Engineering at a top 15 university in June. 

I have interviewed for 3 positions at Company A and made it to the final round for all 3 positions and 2 teams want to hire me. Last week, the HR director gave me a verbal offer. I also got a written offer from Company B last week, but am more interested in the position at Company A.

I returned to the HR director of company A and told her about my other offer and asked to discuss with hiring manager for an increase in compensation and responsibility for the role to justify the increase. The hiring manager agrees to increased responsibility and increased salary and offered to discuss the details with the HR director. 

HR finally gets back to me after the weekend and doesn't give me any increased compensation. I told HR that hiring managers approves of increase compensation and asked for a higher offer. HR director says no changes can be made. I really want to get started as soon as possible and ask for promotion after I have results to show. HR director tells me she won't send me a written offer until Wednesday (2 days from now) and that my earliest start date is 2 weeks from now. I expressed my appreciation and my excitement to start regardless.

I am so frustrated because I don't understand why the HR director is denying the increased compensation the hiring manager approved and if it makes sense that it's taking her 2 days to write an offer and 2 weeks to allow me to start working. 

I turned down my offer from company B and I wrote to my hiring manager to share the details and my status and asked if he could help with getting me started earlier and the increased compensation that we discussed.

So how about someone building a system that takes seawater through tunnels and transports them to the mainland to water the forests when a fire breaks out? Could the use of nuclear energy in any way help to make enough force to move water hundreds of kilometers inland? Would it be necessary to remove the salt from the water or could the salt damage the vegetation? Honestly, I think this should be a priority for governments and corporations to try. Simply doing this will not protect forests from climate change, as other things must be done simultaneously, such as the absolute ban on combustion vehicles before 2030 ...",AskEngineers,False,ItsTimeToFinishThis,/r/AskEngineers/comments/isp98u/massive_irrigation_system_to_protect_forests_from/

After graduating, i landed a job with a great design firm where I had a great team and was learning quite much and rapidly. At about the 1 yr and 8 month mark, i decided to move over to a concrete contracting company, because the pay was better and I've been going through some financial hardships with failed business. At this new company, i work doing form-work design (which a piece of cake compared to what i used to do), and i personally feel like i am not being challenged at all. Aside from that, I am in constant arguments with some of our senior superintendents as they don't like change and like to do things how they have done it for the past 30 years. There's no possibility of growth as they basically pick who's going to take over the leadership positions. I really love the structural design part of engineering and i'm shooting to take my PE exam here soon and eventually get my license. I have been with the company for about 6 month now and my concern is leaving and jumping around so much between companies.

49,"Is it possible to ""overclock"" a typical industrial 3PH 1/2 HP AC induction motor?",1600099434,"I have a really old 3 phase 1/2 HP motor. The thing is fairly large, 1750rpm so probably 2 poles(?)

Is it possible to power it at a higher frequency with proportially higher voltage to get more power at it? I was considering using the motor for an EV since I know induction motors can be used in such an application with an appropriate VFD electronic speed controller.

How much more power could I reasonably expect to get? Why do these large motors have such low power density? Is it because of the lack of active ventilation? i.e. a thermal limit? 

Or is it a design limit (limited maximum torque due to core saturation and higher ohmic losses, since the motor is expected to run at a fixed 60Hz?) If I increase the frequency to, say, 400Hz and increase voltage proportionally, will it make the motor scream at 11000RPM? Would the motor be capable of the same torque at the higher speed and therefore be more powerful? Of course the voltage would probably have to go up since motor Kv is a constant, or another way, the inductance of the coils means higher voltages needed to push higher frequency AC.

I'll give some context, though I'm sure I'll miss a few things.  I go to UNCC.  I'm pretty sure I will graduate with a 4.0.

I never really wanted to go to college, and I am 50/50 on it being a mistake, but if I have a degree my thought is that I may as well use it for something, especially if I can make a bigger impact than having a generalistic, low-skill impact if I didn't use it.

If this is something that sounds feasible, how might I go about getting an internship?  Should I so something else other than spamming applications online?

I need to find the potential flow of a pipe. I understand that this will not be exact because of site specific variances that I cannot measure on site. I just need a base number from trouble shooting. 

The pipe is 2"" copper, starts under 40psi, carries room temperature water, dumps into a air gapped basin at the starting hight, 20m long run.

A little more explanation:
Some repairs were done to a valve that wasn't operating correctly. Maintenance crew thought it would be a good idea to place a pressure reducer in-line (there wasn't one before). The equipment needs access to 72gpm. It isn't getting anywhere near that. The current operation it is running fine but it hasn't had a need, yet, for access to 72gpm. Previously 72gpm wasn't an issue but the line was under probably close to 80psi. Now I have to convince my boss that he has to remove a newly installed pressure reducer for a piece of equipment that is currently functional. Every calculation I find requires velocity,  wich is unknown (plus I wouldn't have to look up an equation if it was that simple). So if 72gpm is easily achievable with a 2"" under 40psi, I need to look for potential causes of the issue.",AskEngineers,False,Fobie_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/irlwo4/what_is_the_potential_flow/

&amp;#x200B;

Hello Engineers of Reddit,

I study mech eng and just started a co-op position this week at a BIM/MEP consulting company which will go on for the next 8 months. The company seems great and so far it looks like the job will be interesting.

I'm just feeling a bit down because we're using AutoCAD MEP and I honestly couldn't figure out a lot of shit this week. First day we got some basic training on company standards/procedures for AutoCAD and the next day I received an email to do some minor tasks for an ongoing project 😨

It took me like 2 hours the first (real) day to figure out how to copy with basepoint and rescale the drawing after I had pasted it to another one... really basic shit but my settings weren't correct which was messing the whole thing up. Ended up calling my superior and she helped me through it but I felt like such a dumbass after. It took me 3 whole days to finish the tasks but they wanted it in 1.

Doesn't help that we sit 10 feet away from other in the office &amp; even basic questions turn into a 20 minute MS Teams meeting with screensharing when it could be solved within 5 minutes of face to face.

In the interview &amp; when they asked on the first day, I told them that I don't know AutoCAD too well since I mainly have experience with 3D modeling (SolidWorks, Rhino, Inventor). And AutoCAD MEP is a completely different beast with all the different options for laying out HVAC ducts, piping etc. To make matters worse there's another co-op student from a different school (often considered better than ours) and he seems to be finishing his work much quicker than me 😔

I've decided to spend this whole weekend to learn all of the basics of AutoCAD MEP, so I turn to you guys for help. Any resources are appreciated; preferrably free and video format so I can learn alongside. Right now I'm thinking of the ""AutoCAD MEP Essentials Training"" by Eric Wing on LinkedIn Learning, if anyone can tell me if that course is helpful that'd be awesome so I don't spend 5 hours for nothing.",AskEngineers,False,SportsAnimeGuy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ircv5p/first_week_of_coop_wasnt_great_any_autocad_mep/

93,Career Advise: Quitting a full time job in an unrelated field for an internship?,1599847840,"This is going to be a long post. Find TL;DR at the end. 

As the question says, I am trying to decide if I should quit my full time job so I can pursue internships in mechanical engineering. I know similar questions have been asked before and I have thoroughly searched the depths of Reddit to avoid asking the same question but I didn't find anything that was similar to my situation so I decided to ask the engineering czars.

Here is some background: I am in my mid-twenties, I am married and have a child. I studied business in college and after a few promotions I managed to get an Associate Director position at a small fin-tech company with reasonable career potential. I enjoy my job but I have always wanted to study engineering so after thoughtful consideration I decided to enroll in school again and get a bachelor's in mechanical engineering. I am currently in my 2nd year and take about 12-14 credits per semester. Needless to say, I have been extremely busy given all my responsibilities but it's been manageable. My position is fully remote so I work from home and they are extremely flexible when it comes to my class schedule. They have a ""we don't care what hours you work, as long as you get the work done"" type of attitude so they support the fact that I am a student. My wife is also extremely supportive and understanding. 

Now down to the details. I have very little on the job engineering experience, other than school projects. I consider myself a decent designer (CREO, SolidWorks and Inventor) and have a solid project management experience (could probably sit for the PMP by the time I'm done with my BS in MechE) and have done well in all my science and engineering classes. 

I have read dozens of posts about engineering internships and the vast majority of people say to get as many as you can. I am not opposed to internships but my situation is slightly more complex than the situation of a 19 year old sophomore than can pack up and move across the country for a summer. I have been considering quitting my full time job to do internships during the summer and then figure something else out during the school year but I am so conflicted. I am worried that I will quit my job to then get an internship that will not teach me much (I was an intern during my business major twice and they were kind of slow and the job was super easy, nothing that stretched me). 

Now, I don't want to come across as arrogant, and my current pay is nothing to be jealous of but we live a comfortable lifestyle (eating out, entertainment, a few local trips a year, etc) and luckily we haven't had to scramble for money but all of this would definitely change if I quit my job to get an internship. Also, my wife is currently not working as she is finishing up school herself so quitting my job doesn't only affect me. I have enough savings to get us through about a year and a half  without working but ideally I would like to use that for a down payment on a house after I graduate. So far my tuition has been fully paid for by scholarships and grants but that may not be the case for the entire duration of my program. I know my job would not give me the whole summer off for an internship, so quitting would be my only option. 

So to those of you that have started your careers or that hire engineers: What would you do in my position? Would quit the job and pursue internships? Or would you let this job fund you through school and focus on personal projects you can then showcase to employers? Do you think I stand a good shot of getting hired relatively quickly upon graduation if I choose the latter option? How much did your internships help you? 

 I will **really** appreciate any advice you have.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am considering quitting a full time job in an unrelated field to pursue internships in mechanical engineering, I am married with a child so I am financially responsible for my family. I am conflicted because I don't know how much the internships will help me and I'm worried it could just be busy/easy work.

30,Corporate R&amp;D in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering.,1599813309,"That's the best title I could manage but it's flawed to some extent - my exact inquiries are on the kind of research happening in corporate mechanical engineering firms, computer (science and) engineering firms, and the necessary course-of-action I must take to attain my goal for a career in computational engineering. I'm an Indian undergraduate studying in my native country, which matters a lot because the government research jobs here tend to be less funded and secure than the ones abroad, and there is a dearth of opportunities in local private firms for mechanical engineers here, which leads to most graduates in the field taking up a job that is completely unrelated to their course - jobs in small IT service-based companies with a salary and work-life that is abysmal. However I understand that you might not have any opinions on that - I presume that this is a US-centric subreddit.

As all comparison posts go, this one also arose out of a dilemma. I've been equally interested in theoretical computer science (heavy on math) and in mechanical engineering research (energy, bio-mechanics, etc.) since high school, but this is based on my conception of what the research might be like, rather than what it actually is, so I naturally resorted to the internet to sort that out for me. After a few hours (and days, and months) of digging around, I've been able to pinpoint my interests to one exact intersection of both these interests - computational engineering.

Here's a link to one of those sources of realization: [Stanford - Research Theme: Computational Engineering.](https://me.stanford.edu/research/research-theme-computational-engineering)

And as you can see, most faculty members working on such problems are from the mechanical engineering department. That should have naturally solved my dilemma - that's the exact thing I want to do, after all.

However, there's a second dimension to all of this - the state of the majority of mechanical engineering jobs in India, which I've discussed earlier. What seems to do well here in terms of job security is computer science, and I could just take that - but I can't leave mechanical engineering problems and work on purely computer science problems (or vice versa). Hence, I posted this entry for two reasons -

1. To figure out if the kind of research I think is happening in mechanical engineering is more than a college applicant's fantasy. And for that, I'll need to know what IS the kind of R&amp;D that goes around in most places.
2. To figure out if I'll still be able to work on these problems after majoring in CS - I won't have the required Physics knowledge to work on it, but then again, I'm not in a position to make logical conclusions out of the gate. That's how desperation works.

That's about it, I guess.

33,Multitouch display (based on LLP) to track the trajectories of worms,1599804390,"Hello there! I'm a biology major. I'm doing my PhD at the moment. Like the title says I'm trying to build a Multitouch display to solve a tracking problem. I will summarize some characteristicis of the worm to give you guys some idea.

I work (or at least used to before covid) with a 1mm (0.4 inches) worms. They usually are in the mud but can be handled and raised in a lab without a problem. The thing is they use chemical traces in the environment to track down larger worms (their food, they are about 2cm-0.78 inches). We tend to do experiments where we put both worms in acrylic boxes and we watch how the tiny worm orientates and tracks the larger worm.

This is a tedious task because I do it by staring at the acrylic boxes for a whole hour ish, I can watch 2 or 3 at a time. So I want to improve and maximize my time when all of this is over.   
At first I thought about using an old Motorola G4 screen but the worms are so tiny and dont even do any pressure or conduct any electrical charge. Since this didnt work i didnt even think about a resistive screen.

Searching for ideas I came across a lot of optics based screens. LLP caught my attention since I dont have to use any camera behind the display, unless I'm testing if the LEDs are working (or at least that is what I understood) and is relatively cheap.  
For anyone wondering what is LLP is basically this: infrared lasers diffract and shine lasers all across a surface and when something breaks that surface, the object lights up. What sees this lighting up (and can then use the data accordingly) is an infrared camera pointed at the plane. But since i dont want to use a camera i was thinking about an array of photo sensors. Or you can watch this video:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player\_embedded&amp;v=ooZlsIlglqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ooZlsIlglqk)

Since the worms are SUPER small I'm wondering if this can work. I mean, as seen in the video, a finger is fine for the laser to track, but with a tiny worm it makes me wonder.

So, my question(s) is: since i don't want to throw money away in something it wont work, does anybody know if this can track objects that small. If not, is there any type of screen or something that I could use to track this tiny worms?

I know there is commercial (and expensive) tracking devices as used in C. elegans, but I want to try to build my own idea.

Of course it's just a comedy sub but recently I made an interesting discovery.

I was interested in strange scientific experiments that took place in real life and I found this [article](https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/2017/04/the-cat-telephone/) from 1929. The article talks about two men. Professor Ernest Glen Wever and his research assistant Charles William Bray that conducted the experiment at Princeton University in 1929. During the experiment they connected wires to a cat's auditory nerve with a telephone line. Ernest talked into the cat's ears while his assistant Charles was listening through a telephone in a soundproofed room down the hall. The experiment worked perfectly! They said that the sound coming out of the telephone was exactly what the person was saying into the cat's ears!

I found Stokes Equation but as an EE i am not familiar with it and would like some help. Not sure if Civil, Mechanical or Chemical would know, ill just go with civil on flair please don't hold that against me.

Equation is;

speed = ω = (2(ρp-ρf)gr2) / (9μ)

So far i got:

ω in the velocity (m/s)

g is the gravitational field strength (m/s2) = 9.81

R is the radius of the spherical particle (m) = 2.5E-6 or 2.5 microns

ρp is the mass density of the particles (kg/m3) = 7874 for iron

ρf is the mass density of the fluid (kg/m3) 997 for hot (70C) water

μ is the dynamic viscosity (kg/(m*s)). I think this is where i make a mistake i'm using 978 for water at roughly 70C.

Putting all those in to Stokes' equation i get 0.000000344905 m/h this is far slower than i predicted.

77,What am I potentially getting myself into?,1599750624,"First a little background. I’m in my late 30s with a BA in philosophy and a MA in education (though not currently a teacher or in education). I am thinking of going back to get a masters in Engineering (mechanics or electrical not sure which yet) but I have basically zero formal science or math education. I learned rather late in my undergraduate that I have a passion for math and physics and have very slowly been teaching myself some of those topics over the past 15 years or so. I did teach elementary math and science when I was teaching and I have managed to learn some math (up to about the beginning of integral calculus) and very basic Newtonian physics. 

I have started taking precalculus at my local community college in order to apply for a masters in engineering program and have been accepted at the local state university as a non-degree seeking student for the time being in order to take the prerequisite classes for the masters program. (Calc 1–3, physics 1-2, and some general engineering classes)

I have a decent paying but completely unfulfilling job a wife and 2 kids. What am I potentially getting myself into? I plan on taking calc 1 and physics 1 in the spring semester and from that point taking 2-3 classes each semester including summer which will have me completing all prerequisite classes in about 2 years or so while maintaining my job.

85,Counting Hours of Salaried Employees,1599744259,"I'll start off with a little background on myself: 4 years in the Marine Corps straight out of high school. Got out and got my BSME, several internships that added up to a few years of experience in Solidworks and Inventor doing machine design, among other engineering/business skills while in school. Graduated with a decent GPA 4 years ago and have worked a combination of design, project management, and sales roles since. Some of these were very time demanding, which has its pros and cons, but must came with significant autonomy. I'm coming up on a year at my current employer as a design engineer.

When I started here, I did want I normally do and would work to a stopping point at the end of the day. That may be 5 min early or 2 hours late. In my perception, that's part of being salary. I've noticed a company culture where people avoid taking responsibility and shift blame whenever possible. There are processes for everything, with the seeming intent to have somewhere to place blame when something goes wrong. This is a small company with lass than 75 people. Primarily manufacturing with a new department trying to be successful in construction. I'm part of the const. dept. Dec-March, my coworker (des. eng.) and I worked 10 &amp; 12 hr days because of time crunches and management mistakes on several projects, while no one else did. I just chocked it up to being salary, gritted my teeth, and did what I could to help the team, while thinking that I had the autonomy of a salaried professional. When we finally were caught up, we tried to take off about 2 hrs early on a Friday, having already worked 55 hrs that week and completed the critical items... That was shut down. We were told it wouldn't be fair to other employees if we left early, even though everyone else was still working the normal 40.

As the months creeped on through this year, there have been more and more blanket restrictions put on   everyone in the company. Emails come out stating that lunch or 30 minutes and that's it, if you take longer, make sure you stay late to cover it. Regardless of overtime worked the week prior, 40 hr minimum is expected of all employees. We're currently working 9 hrs mon-thurs, 4 hrs on Fri, so the offices can get sanitized after everyone leaves. On Tuesday, an email was sent out stating that we're working an extra hr on Friday to make up for the holiday on Monday... I guess paid holidays are only 8 hrs?

I'd love to hear from some of you who have had similar experience, or understand some of the old school approaches to things. 

TLDR: As a salaried professional, is it normal to be managed the same as an hourly laborer? Am I overreacting to feel that, if I'm not allowed the ability to manage my own time, then I will work only the 40 hrs required? With that style of management, does it lead to apathy and reduced want to go above and beyond when it's needed?

21,Is office location a viable reason for wanting to transfer to a new office so quickly?,1599696622,"So a bit of background: I just graduated from university back in May with a Bachelor's in aerospace engineering. I started my first full-time position with a big government contractor back in July. I'm about to finish up my second month here and I am seriously absolutely miserable here. To be honest, the work is fascinating and pretty unique. Also, the company culture, my team, and my manager are supportive and great, but the location is slowly depressing me. Not only is it a dull area, my family is a 4 hour drive north and my friends and girlfriend are 2 hours north, so there is no one down here for me to spend time with during the week. Consequently, I am forced to cram all of my time with my loved ones on the weekend, losing a lot of time to traveling. I know making friends where I am is a solution, but I also do not see my future developing here.

As a result of this, I have been considering a couple of options: talking to my manager about possibly transferring, or applying to positions with other companies in the location that I'm interested in. I love the company and I would rather not have to leave it so quickly, but I put more thought into leaving this place than being happy and enjoying my life after college.

 I really hate this feeling and feel guilty for wanting to leave so soon, but I fear that it is going to affect my performance soon and that's going to be detrimental to my future. Also, FYI, I took relocation and have an apartment lease until June, which is somewhat forcing me to stay here until, earliest, Summer 2021.

Thanks for taking the time to read this....
We are planning for a swing hanging from ceiling in our house. We have brick walled house with wooden A frame ceiling with tiled roof. Ceiling is gyprock/sheet rock to rafters. 

In our family room spanning 5 meters wide, in the middle, from the ceiling we would like to suspend one 1.8 x 1 meter wooden swing with chains for 3 adults to sit on (collective weight worst scenario 350 kg).

Where we want to hang the swing, there is 5 meter steel I beam is sitting on two brick columns on both ends and this steel I beam is supporting the roof. 

Questions:

1. Can this horizontal steel beam can take the vertical burden of weight of 3 adults with swinging tangential force? If I can make use of this existing beam, how to secure it from moving (rocking) due to swing movements?


2. If not, what will be our alternatives?

If I need to add dedicated beam for the swing, how to size the beam of 5 meters span for this purpose?

What will be the best way to support this dedicated beam for the swing?

Can this beam anchored to brick column which is there already supporting I beam for the roof or can it be anchored drilled in to the brick wall on both ends or add additional vertical beam anchored to concrete floor to support. 

If dedicated beam is the way to go, then steel or wooden beam?

Im using Viasat ACU4100 antenna which is common for ground station . I already established connection with the system computer using Ni MAX and the connection is based on TCP/IP and port. I can send and receive respond from the instrument. Howewer, I need to ask particular data from the instrument which is elevation angle.The pyvisa part and connection part is done, I can do it.

Based on the manual given by Viasat, I use their SCPI message protocol provided which

 ISTS:msg msgres:INST 0:DATA&lt;(parameters ID) (Type of Data(IN ST FL)) (Data based on viasat)&gt;

To explain the code:
ISTS : give me permission to access the system as an observer

msg : based on the viasat manual which is I use 203 that return the summary message

msgres : 1001 

parameters id : I use 10002 to get summary of the instrument

type of data : IN is integer, FL is float and ST is string

data based on viasat: i just put 0 because i don't know the data actually

The scpi i typed in python is

scs.query ('ISTS:203 1001:INST 0: DATA&lt;10002 IN 0&gt;')

which gave me summary of all the responses from the ACU4100 in ASCII values, and the data i needed are in there. 


The problem is, I have the parameters id for elevation angle. which is 504, and I don't know the data. When I put DATA&lt;504 IN 0&gt; , its return error which said 504 parameters id are not handled.

I have 2.5 years of experience as a Design Engineer. Currently working in a Tier 1 Automotive Reverse Engineering firm who supplies for Top OEMs in  India. I use STL files (Optical scan/High Energy scan) and build 3D model on top of those files in Creo Parametric . Basically reverse engineering

I am versatile in using Creo Parametric (Good at surface modelling). intermediate in using CATIA and Solidworks. Since i am working only with scans, all i have to do is to achieve those part profiles with minimum deviation as possible from scan, following few basic GD&amp;T rules and that's it.

I am heavily worked under the clock with no OT, with some impossible timelines to achieve. (for ex. they want me to finish a part in 8 hours which take 12-14 hours to complete)

I never worked in an R&amp;D company till now, but i am eager to see how things work there. the idea of building a component from scratch, all the brainstorming and stuff drives me. pretty sure there won't be deadline for developing things (at least it won't be managed hour wise). i keep applying to Top Mechanical/Automotive OEMs but still no luck.

What type of job i can search for. What type of jobs i can branch from here. Does Reverse Engineering has a good market? i just want to work in Mechanical domain with a good paying, learning and comfortable environment where i don't have to clock time sheet for 8.5 hrs/day.

------

Preface: EE 1.5yrs into my first industry job as an EE1 working for an international EPCM firm. Lots of looking at drawings, point to point checks, CAD work, etc. I'd say 3/4 of what I do is more monotonous document control / QA type stuff. Other 1/4 is actually ""engineering"" in a sense that I have to really think and put my understanding of circuits to use (though its really more of ""is this coil getting energized at the right time for this contact to close and start the motor appropriately"" thinking rather than mathematical analysis). 


Problem: Today I was working on updating a drawing with some as-built markups made to some vendor drawings by a contractor that did some retrofit work. I had to make sure all of the proper signals were getting to the proper controllers or junction boxes. Make sure the starter on our drawing matched the vendor docs, electrically speaking. 

And for whatever reason I was just stumped today and had a  hard time wrapping my mind around some of the stuff. I felt like I was sitting there wasting time, even after reaching out to a senior engineer for some guidance. Ended up getting a game plan together and plan to start fresh in the AM to verify &amp; pick up the marks I made.

I'm not used to struggling at work &amp; typically excel at being highly efficient (to the point it has gotten me a 5 figure raise and project leads fighting over me in a 1.5yr span). My weekly timesheet is distributed based on specific things I worked on and therefore I track hours for various activities. Some part of me feels this weird guilt this evening for not being as productive as usual. I want to charge the hours I actually spent on the exercise today but also feel guilty charging for inefficiency due to my struggling today. Does anyone else feel this way at times? I dont feel this way when I get to sit in meetings (""that could've been an email"") and do nothing but twiddle thumbs. But somehow being inefficient like this always leaves me feeling some sort of guilt. Maybe some level of shame/self-disappointment too for not getting it figured out faster?

Anyone else experience this? And/or have some words to help and/or suggestions to help me in the future? Office life is weird for me as I'm used to skilled labor type jobs where I already have the skill and dont really have to think about doing it. Some things work like this in my current EE position but sometimes I get a curveball tossed my way and its no fun to swing at.",AskEngineers,False,geekinterests,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ip5x7s/what_do_you_do_when_you_get_stuck_on_something/

I LOVE Matlab coding/controls but all of my job experience has been in the construction/civil engineering industry. I do not like this kind of work at all but it's just the sort of jobs I've been presented with. I'm currently working in my college town as an engineering technician (in California) for a pretty small company, I wont go into detail as to maintain some form of anonymity. I'm unhappy at this job. It's a 45 minute drive into the middle of nowhere and everyone I work with is over 50 years old so I have no connection with them socially. The pay isn't amazing either and it's an hourly job.   


I have now seen countless colleagues who I've tutored in undergrad land full-blown engineering jobs at great companies and it's been pretty soul crushing. I don't mean to be bitter towards them because they're all great engineers, but if they can land a job like that then why can't I?

11,"The hardest part of learning anything, is knowing what to words to use in google. How do you quickly learn what you need to know in order to effectively google and get answers?",1599603000,"Whenever I start to expand my knowledge into new areas, I often find myself googling a phrases with super generic terms, learning a new word, putting that word back into google and repeating this process for several hours/days. 

Since I don't know the proper names of different things are, how to specify the requirements I'm looking for, or the parameters of the project when I'm looking stuff up on google, it makes everything take much longer than needed, and often leads me down several dead-ends because I misunderstood something. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I was looking for a solution to having one stream of water be directed down a path, so I googled ""valve with two outputs"" then read for a while and learned about ball valves, so I googled ""ball valve, two outputs"" and found a bunch of 90 degree ball valves that allowed for one or both paths to be open, but that wasn't what I wanted since I wanted the paths to be mutually exclusive, so I googled ""valve with two outputs, but can't have both open at the same time"" and did more reading, learned nothing, so I pivoted to trying to find out the proper name for ""Y shaped valve with control similar to a rocker switch"" and so on... I never did find what I wanted, so I just decided to shelve/abandon that part of the project.

&amp;#x200B;

Then today, I hit a similar issue trying to find a specific set up for PVC fittings, I had a reddit post all drafted in my head about how I'd try to explain what it was I was looking for, then I remembered tinkercad, so I spent 30-60 minutes in that to draw out what I was looking for, took a screenshot and readied myself to post it and go ""Hey, I'm looking for a thing that does [this](https://imgur.com/a/dZP2aox) or something similar, my goal is to drill a hole in a thing, then attach things to either side of the hole that are airtight/watertight and attach hoses to each of the things."" However, the engineer in me quickly noticed that this was definitely not a scale-able approach to learning, because for each new project/subject, I'd end up making like 15 posts asking ""Hey, wut dis?"" and just generally being a nuisance.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this frustration has led me to the question I really need answered which is: If I have little-to-zero knowledge about some facet of engineering, and I want to build something related to that aspect of engineering, what resources or methods do you use to help you learn what questions to ask and get answers faster? 

Another phrasing would be, if I want to build a cabinet with drawers, but I've never seen one and don't know the words ""cabinet"" or ""drawer"", how do I go from ""diy big box with smaller open boxs that slide in and out,"" to ""DIY cabinet with drawers"" ?

I've seen cables that can control two struts at a time, so I would have the driver's side corners linked to one cable and the passenger's side corners linked with another cable.  

Does this seem like it will work?  My only experience with gas struts is on our cabinet doors, which open like a hatchback, so a very lightweight application that is a more traditional use of the strut.

**Here's the gist.** I picked up an aluminum gantry that was used at a commercial automatic car wash and (I was told) held a motor on top and 1 large brush on each side. It would run all day cleaning cars. Is it possible to calculate how much weight it can support based on the dimensions? Basically, I am hoping that it can hold/lift AT LEAST 1 ton to use as a gantry crane in my garage &amp; hold possibly more weight. I like how it has 3 crossbars that I can spread the weight around (or add stability to my items) and want to use this one instead of buying a new gantry.

27,Physics behind Current transformer insulation,1599591198,"Hi 
Can someone please explain the physics behind why I can use a 600v rated window CT either on the breaker bushing or directly on bus inside an 8kV switchgear cell... But if I were to use a bar CT inside the same cell (say on the ground of the cell and measuring the bus current) I would need a 15kV rated bar CT. 

There ratings are specific to the equipment insulation. 

Thanks - I can clarify more if needed. 

The window CT has a BIL of 10kV but I view that as needed for the random faults and not a consistent protection from partial discharge or a thing. 

In my head the insulation is meant to protect from a potential flashover from a nearby ground or different bus phase.  A window CT can be just as close to a ground point or different phase than a bar CT when inside the cell No?",AskEngineers,False,oduzzay,/r/AskEngineers/comments/iozlt7/physics_behind_current_transformer_insulation/

We’re hiring a process engineer and we’re wanting to go with an entry level person to save some money, and we’ve dialed it down to two candidates.

I’d love to really shine in this area for my company and honestly I have a good idea who I want to go with already, I’m organizing my thoughts into a PowerPoint today, but I just wanted to ask this sub.

One candidate is 22 and she has 2 internships at 2 different companies. Her GPA is pretty good, and she uses a lot of technical know how in her conversation which honestly shocked us with some of the acronyms she knew and business lingo. Some shit I don’t even know yet. We have had two phone convos with her and honestly this is where I lost her. She comes off as very confident but to a degree it almost is cocky. She talks about how she is going to improve x and y and z at our company. If you ask me, this is a pipe dream. I know first hand I’m not improving Jack shit until at least a year, my job is to sit here and listen and figure things out. One particular question we had is “how would you react to a peer in your field struggling in a group project” and she said she would give that person a deadline to improve and then ask the group head to remove them. Her reasoning is that the “teams end goal is more important than not hurting feelings.” Huge red flag we all picked up on.

The other candidate is 25, took a year off college which explains the older age, he has no internships but his gpa is actually better than the other girl. He was very honest with us in what he knew and didn’t know. His personality however is what won me over personally and I hope my team agrees with me. He was very light, easy going, and his response to the question we gave the girl was to try and figure out the struggling members strengths and weaknesses and try to move them to another role in the group which better suits them. Huge plus to hear that.

The only major red flag with the 25 year old guy is that he doesn’t have any internship experience, which we all think would help him put his foot in the door much quicker, and that he didn’t really know how to use programs like solidworks, autocad, MiniTab. I don’t know what ME degree doesn’t teach you how to use those programs in very great detail, but this guy was very honest in letting us know that he wasn’t very good with these programs.

I have other funds on the side and would also be eligible for unemployment for a couple of years. Let's assume money is not a limiting factor.

I've been passionate about dams, turbines, hydro power for some years now, eating technical articles and visiting on weekends every single piece infrastructure in a 300 km radius from home.

Unfortunately (for me) the original authors chose not make their model available, so I'm attempting to rebuild it by following their described method and cited sources. 

I have a base process model built, with biomass defined as a non-conventional solid (currently using the HGCOALGEN package to model HHV/dhf etc., this will be changed later), with reactions being modeled with the RYield block and FORTRAN calculators to define product yields and product qualities (ULTANAL, PROXANAL etc.).

This model is doing a pretty good job of replicating the published data, and will happily spit out sensible results when fed biomass proximate analysis data (ash%, carbohydrate%, lipid%, etc.).

I'm at the stage where I'd like to link my model to Aspen Simulation Workbook (ASW) in Excel (Office 365, 64-bit) to enable me to rattle through a range of ""what-if"" analysis and different biomass compositions, however I've not actually got an ASW button available on my ribbon tab.

When I check the Excel add-ons (File&gt;Options&gt;Add-ins&gt;Manage Add-ins) I see that I have Aspen OSE Workbook ticked and enabled. I've tried unticking and re-enabling but no change.

71,Should I continue asking for a salary review/raise during COVID times?,1599529251,"This is sort of a AITA situation and me generally asking for advice. 

I am employed at an engineering consultancy and have been working there full time for nearly three years (and part time for longer). At the beginning of this year, I found out that new graduates were on salaries very marginally lower than my own (a few k). I am also no longer a graduate. I raised this with management who acknowledged the problem with salary discrepancies amongst early career employees and said it was being addressed. I was offered a temporary increase in pay and other perks e.g. training and I left it at that. 

I recently came across a seek listing for a job from my company, which was basically for my exact role but no specification for years of experience (but exactly my skillset). I did a quick seek the salary check and the lowest salary is 10k higher than what I am on (call is Salary A) and the salary range is 40k. I know the tool isn't something to rely on but I believe the salary range is reasonable. 

I am wondering whether I should bring this up with my managers again. I know that companies will always offer new employees a higher salary than existing employees, but I think I'm worth at least the lowest salary in the advertised role. I also have a friend in another team who started at the same time as me, from the same university cohort, who is on more than Salary A (I know you can't really compare teams but it's an example). However I know it is COVID times and I feel guilty about pressing the point with management when everyone is finding employment difficult and people in other industries are getting laid off/on reduced hours (though engineering as an industry is coping fairly well). My company hasn't been doing amazing financially lately and historically has been ""stingy"", so maybe I should accept things as they are or look for a new position (which is another gamble because of COVID).

The bypass valve has never been disturbed since the chillers have been started about 12 years ago and the marker on the valve shows that it is in a closed position.

1- Is there any other possible explanation for the flows if we consider the bypass valve to not be open/faulty?

2- If the bypass is opened 25% on purpose, what flows can we expect? Would that  make the system any better?

I have approximately 15 years experience in automotive parts manufacturing (Tier 1 &amp; Tier 2), and have worked 3 different jobs. My most recent job I've been at almost 5 years.   


I have interviewed outside of the automotive industry, and have been unsuccessful in finding a new job so far.

If you are a person who has hired an engineer recently - please, I'm especially interested in knowing the competitiveness of what I have in your particular industry. I have even offered through a recruiter to take a significant paycut to get out of the automotive industry (over $15k reduction)

&amp;#x200B;

My background is:   


BS of Mechanical engineering from a state school

Have worked in process engineering, maintenance, and in a capital engineer role. Approximately 3 years of direct supervisory experience with 9 employees maximum.  

Self taught controls engineer because of necessity - I can program PLCs and do many integration tasks. I can program robots from scratch including safe zones/homing routines but I'm out of practice with the robots. I have pretty complete knowledge on how to competently design the electrical side of a machine from scratch. I routinely give contractors specific instruction on how to complete integration, that basically starts with a wiring diagram and a description of all changes that need to be made software side.   


From a project management standpoint, I have been specifier/project manager for many machines, everything from small assembly machines to assembly lines with 10+ machines building entire complex assemblies. Currently most of my projects are in $1million capital. 

From a mechanical design perspective, I am competent with solidworks and can do assemblies of a moderate complexity. I use it nearly daily in either designing replacement tooling or making process improvements.   


What I absolutely don't want in a job is to be ""hands-on"" on a regular basis. I have turned wrenches and troubleshooted electronics for my entire career.  At my current job, I am used as a maintenance guy first, engineer second. For every job I've interviewed for , I have been told that would not be expected but in a JIT Tier 1 company, there's just no time for anyone other than the fastest person to work out the problem. I do not volunteer to do the maintenance work, I am told to do it by my management. I have pushed back and been told that my position is one of production support, even though that is not at all the on-paper job description.

**1) Are my skills valuable in any other industry?**

**2) How can I write my resume to reduce the chance that I will get a job where I am used as a technician/mechanic instead of an engineer?**

Even if i were to get offered a position it would be in sales, which is far from my interest. The country has very little choices in terms of companies with a global reach for me to reach out to for employment. Local companies are known to exploit non westerners or locals and the best position I was offered was 200 pounds a month on a 6 day work week + available on call at an all times basis.

The biggest challange I face is that I have had to relocate to Qatar due to my passport being from the third world, I cannot return to my own country as we have nothing over there and one of my parents is employed in the middle east. My passport has been the biggest roadblock for anything related towards my career. In the UK, It took me 11 months to secure a placement and after my placement, I have had about 4 full time graduate offers sent to me, all of which were receded due to my passport despite the issue being discussed during interviews.

As a result of all this, I have been looking to apply for a Canadian PR and a passport down the line but have been put down by Canadian recruiters who said I have no chance with the passport I have on hand.

Im really frustrated as I dont know how to proceed forward, there are very small choices in qatar and I cant get employed anywhere else in the world because i drew a bad number on the birth lottery and have an extremely invaluable passport? I see alot of classmates from school days happily moving to Canada under their parents, yet my family has absolutely no wealth or drive to do anything positive. I really love the engineering industry but im rapidly being pushed away from it just to stay employed, this whole situation is taking a toll on me as I do not feel anything anymore, I dont want to play games, talk to whatever few friends I have left or put myself out there for relationships. I also have no idea on how to create an alternate source of income and I am coming to learn it is extremely important in this day and age, I cannot rely on my family for any of these questions as they are heavily opposed to change and get quite defensive and angry when I want advise on any of these topics, they also dont know how to help with employment but will get upset if i loose employment.",AskEngineers,False,Throwaway3rdWrldEngi,/r/AskEngineers/comments/io9kc1/im_a_graduate_engineer_with_work_experience_and_i/
8,Why some bearing housings (sheet metal types) have square mounting holes?,1599492487,"I used this type of bearing in the past, but never realized why they need carriage bolts for mounting?

The only thing that comes to my mind is that they designed these bearings for tight space applications so the mounting holes are by nature of design very close to the bore, as a result you won't have enough room to hold the hex head bolt using wrench while tightening the nut.   
With carriage bolts (for the square holes) you don't have to worry about that.

But just looking at it seems like there might be enough space for a wrench too. Then again I haven't assembled one myself ever, so I might be wrong!

Any ideas?

9,Laser tripwire for narrow objects,1599491737,"Hi folks,

I'm looking for a laser emitter with a beam diameter of approximately 2mm.

Basically, I need to build a tripwire circuit (with a laser receiver placed 30cm in front of the emitter) which must detect objects which can be as narrow as 2mm, for example, 3d printing filament.

The laser receiver/sensor will be connected to a Raspberry PI and a program will do some stuff when the receiver stops receiving the beam from the emitter.

For the receiver, I was thinking about using something like Ky-008 and for the emitter one of those cheap 5mw 650nm lasers.

16,Concerned that I may have chosen the wrong engineering discipline,1599473205,"I'm in my 2nd year as an Electrical Engineering student. The first year was fine as we were required to take a mixture of electrical, electronic, computer engineering courses. However, now I'm in my second year, I realised my stream requires us to focus on power related courses. It's not that I hate power engineering, but that I realised that my interests are in communications, computer systems, and signals rather than power.

I graduated in May with a degree in Aerospace Engineering (without any internship experience) and have not been able to get a job. I recently had to move in with some family a few states away from where I graduated while I continue to look for work.

A family friend told me about an opening at their work for a delivery driver and that I should apply. I turned in an application in person and was pretty much hired on the spot.

I would like to work somewhere that will put me in proximity to other engineers and will let me gain applicable experience (such as working as a technician or machinist or something along those lines).

My plan is to connect pin A on the PCB to a grounded resistor (of similar value to the total resistance between pins A and C) and connect pin C on the PCB to ground.

49,How much force is this armrest under?,1599417978,"Hi folks,

Apologies if this is not the right place to ask this, and for all of the concepts I’m about to mix up!

I use a power wheelchair, and both magnesium alloy armrests have now broken at their pivots in less than a year of use.

PICS: https://imgur.com/gallery/XJ0ZyKR

I’m convinced that this is because the design and materials in question are flawed for the application. I weight 225 pounds. The wheelchair is intended for patients weighing up to 400 pounds. The thing is, people in wheelchairs are usually in them because their legs are unable to support them. So when I (or almost anyone in a wheelchair) is transferring to a standing position, I need to push up off if the armrests.

The armrests are one piece (forgetting the foam padding). The attachment end is a round pivot with a 90° stop machined into it. In both instances, the armrest failed at this pivot, with a fracture appearing along the full length of the stop.

The manufacturer insists that these failures are flukes. When the first one failed, it resulted in a bad fall. When the other side failed a few months later, I was lucky to land back in the seat. 

Needless to say, I don’t trust this mechanism anymore. I’m going to make supports for the “front” armrest section using split clamps and steel rods to serve as a backup/help share the load.

BUT, when I talk to their customer support on Tuesday, I want to make the case that the force being placed on the pivot area is not a simple static load. The armrest is 15” long. Can anyone help me understand how much force these components might be under due to leverage? Obviously you can’t give me an exact number, but if say a 60 pound peak forced was put on the far end of the armrest, what is the resulting force at the pivot? I can’t wrap my head around which class of lever this would be. I’m also thinking that fatigue must play a big role.

56,What direction should I take in my Electrical/Electronic Engineering career?,1599408895,"Hi there.

I'm looking for some opinions from Electronic and Electrical Engineers (ideally but other disciplines welcome), regarding my career path.

Some background on me:
I graduated in 2018, working as an Electronic Design Engineer for 6 months before moving into a Technician role thereafter which I have been in since. I am aware that some might see the move as a step backwards, but the role had certain benefits for me; better pay, shorter working hours, a much reduced commute and offered more 'hands-on' work, which I enjoy.

After almost two years in this role, I am now looking for a change. The company I work for has few progression opportunities or perks, and I feel like I have went as far (development-wise) as I can in my role. 

Here is where my uncertainty comes in - I am unsure what route to take in my next role. I have the following three ideas:

1). Go back to Electronic Design/Hardware Engineering.
Pros:
Multiple employers based in my local area.
Most of my background skills and experience is in this field.
Good career prospects/development opportunities.
Cons:
Lack of 'hands-on'/field work in a lot of roles.

2). Remain in an Electronic Technician role but move to a better company.
Pros:
Has the hands-on element that I enjoy.
Can continue to develop skills I have learned in my current role.
Cons:
Not as high paying future prospects - I am already on a competitive salary for my role.

3). Move into a more Electrical-oriented role (Control/Automation Engineering/PLC programming).
Pros:
Seems to be able to deliver a good mixture of design/hands-on work.
Good career prospects/development opportunities.
More widespread availability of jobs in my area.
Cons:
I have the least experience in this field (did Electrical Engineering at college and one module on PLC programming at Uni).

I'm curious to hear your opinions about these options and my choice of going from an Engineer role, to that of a Technician.

I am planning to apply for Fall/Winter 2022. I had a few questions regarding whether I should pursue MS in Mechatronics or not,the most important ones are :

1.Before Covid-19 break I had asked my Mechatronics faculty for advice,he suggested that outside India most of the top colleges do not offer Mechatronics as subject for masters but rather have the topics covered in it as electives, so he suggested that I should go for either robotics or embedded systems. After going through some sites about the subjects covered in these fields I think that Embedded Systems is better if I had an Electrical background and Robotics if I had a CSE background. Did I interpret it correctly ? Do you think that I (Mech UG) have the required  basic knowledge to excel in these fields.

2. Are there enough jobs for a Mechatronics Engineer in the job market ?

3. I have shortlisted US,Germany and Australia to do my masters, in which of these countries do you think I will get a good exposure to this field and have a reliable job market.

When I was in undergrad, I wanted to pursue a masters, but I took a little break to save up some money/try some different jobs/and actually live (because what is that while you are in undergrad). Now, I want to expand my knowledge into my other big passion, which is tech. 

What jobs would be available if I was to pursue a masters in engineering for computer engineering/software engineering/computer science with my background knowledge? I would ideally want to be designing stuff/innovating. Also, would a M.Eng be worth it? My minimum GPA from my last 2 years in my bachelors is enough for me to qualify at a school of my choice - I hope (3.67/4.33 while minimum is usually a 3/4.33, which is a B, to get in). I would ideally want to do it part time after work, but I'm not sure if doing it in 1 year is better or not.

31,"From an environmental impact standpoint, would a large but heavily modular computer be better than a small and integrated one?",1599290616,"Let's say there are two options for a computer with the same specs: a large one where everything is on a separate device that all plugs into each other, and a much smaller one where everything is soldered onto a single board.

On one hand, the larger modular computer would be upgradable with future components, as long as parts are still compatible, which unfortunately is not the case for components like CPUs and RAM after just a few years, but other components like expansion cards and storage devices tend to have much better backwards compatibility. 

On the other hand, the smaller integrated computer can be made of much less material. Though I'm not sure if the number of microchips and other components are reduced, but it's possible, things like PCB materials, shielding and outer casings are definitely reduced. A single very well integrated computer might not be much larger than one of the higher end graphics cards for example.

41,I’ve managed to pull off a career changer during a pandemic.,1599277865,"I am an industrial engineer (we don’t even get post flair!), and I will admit, it was really tough to find a decent job in the first few years after college.  During college, we always got the short end of the stick.  “Imaginary engineer”, they would say.  I suppose the principles and applications of IE are more generalized than something direct like ChemE. 

Regardless, for the 2-3 years after graduation, I job hopped like crazy. I found myself doing admin support/database type work in biotech and pharma, but it was administrative work.  My salary barely broke 60k despite having SIX unique jobs. 

I obtained my EIT by passing the FE in industrial and systems, not because I cared for its relevance, but my boss tied it to a small bonus ($1,500). I never got that because I found out I passed after quitting that job too. 

It turns out that having a niche skill in a uniquely regulated industry allowed me to do a major career changer.  I became employed by a FAANG cloud provider, as an ops engineer.  I nearly doubled my salary to $120k, after setting for BS job after BS job, bachelor of science or the other acronym. 

It was the ultimate self-actualization and vindication that I wasn’t useless or someone’s glorified secretary. (At one point, facilities guys would ask me to set up meetings and scan documents. Some would ask why I went to a large university to do such menial work.)

This post is turning into a brag, but this wasn’t my intent.  When I was miserable earlier this year and last, I was launching hundreds of job applications, sometimes within a week.  I was searching desperately for candidate processes that seemed to take forever.  One took 7 months for a rejection.  I flirted with Gov jobs and had the same delayed rejection.  

But how on Earth I managed to land this huge job, as a virtual new hire, interviewed and on boarded remotely... kind of makes me think that there is a time for every engineer.  Maybe there’s an element of luck. Or timing, or probability.

Perhaps, no matter how mundane and irrelevant a job may be, it might create a path forwards for you, a skill set unique to you that makes you highly attractive, and a compelling hire.   

For example, my laziness with working on large datasets in Excel (external to the DB) made me dabble in Pivot, SQL, and VBA though it was beyond my job expectations. Similarly, I asked to own engineering projects and contribute, though I wasn’t employed to as an engineer.  I learnt about integrations, authentication, touch points, and the design process specific to this one system. I was given ownership of this system as SME, a acronym I hate, all while -not- being an engineer and paid $28/hr. 

When the system existed in a different sector/industry, that was my escape route. I’ve never been more thankful and motivated to contribute my entire knowledge and effort.  And yes, money is a great motivator. 

This is the end of settling and the beginning of development. I am elated. I thank this community for the insight that you’ve given me all throughout my journey.",AskEngineers,False,DangerousDirection,/r/AskEngineers/comments/imuh65/ive_managed_to_pull_off_a_career_changer_during_a/

46,"Where does corona discharge current actually ""go""?",1599271949,"So I just started taking my power systems engineering class at my University and we started talking about corona discharge losses in conductors. As far as I understand it, corona discharge happens when the air can no longer insulate against the electric field because it's dielectric strength has been exceeded. So some of the current bleeds off the lines into the air. My question is, where is this current going? Current obviously can't have a 1 way path so where does it go? I thought it would just travel to ground but then I also thought, why are we using line to ground voltage instead of line to line voltage? The line to line voltage is higher and would result in a higher electric field at the surface of the conductor if we used one of the other phases as the voltage reference point. I don't see the reason for why choosing ground here is the only valid reference point. I tried to look up information about this but a lot of the online resorces I found are just giving information on calculating the voltage needed to cause the effect, and not what is actually happening with it. 

Also, at this point, I am a couple years removed from my E&amp;M Physics course so I am a little bit rusty on the physics behind all this. Any explanations you might have would be helpful to me.

48,"I'm an automation ""technologist"". Is it worth it going back to college to get an engineering degree for industrial controls?",1599271074,"I first went to college for a law degree. Upon graduation, I started the steps for admission to the bar but found out I really didn't like practicing law. I was 25 at the time, and I felt I was running out of time to start a career.

I took a gap year to figure out what I wanted to do in life and I found out about controls. I went to a technical college where I graduated with a 3 years ""technologist"" diploma in electrical engineering (for Americans, I suppose the equivalent is those ""technology"" degrees). Luckily, second attempt to start a career was a hit and I fell in love with the field.

I've been employed for two years as a controls specialist/PLC programmer for an SI. I'm mostly involved in programming and commissioning, I also sometimes do the electrical design of the control panels but the process design is mostly left to the engineers, although I always have the right to say something about the controls. I really enjoy my job, but I sometimes regret not going all the way and doing the full engineering degree (I would have had to catch up on 3 years of school prerequisites versus 1 for the tech diploma - the system here is very severe).

The thing is, while I intellectually want to progress in my field, learn all I can about it and a full blown engineering degree is one obvious way of doing that, for the plans I have for my career, it does seem a bit...overkill. The task I enjoy the most by far is programming PLCs and HMIs.

I also like process control, modeling processes and using the data to figure out the best tools for the job (ie feedforward, Smith predictors, linearization of control terminal elements if warranted, etc), which also involves PLC/HMI programming, as well as data acquisition. I'm not so much interested in instrument/terminal element selection, wider-scope process design, project management, etc - in my company at least, the engineers do that and I'm happy to leave that to them.

All the job postings I've seen for jobs like mine specify ""electrical engineering technologist's diploma or engineering degree"" as if they were equivalent. I know I'm probably losing out on at least a few ks of compensation not having an engineering degree, and the obvious project management roles that might pay more but that I wouldn't really be a good fit for.

What I really want to do is simply keep doing what I'm doing, but just be better at it. I know that an engineering degree isn't going to teach me anything about PLC/HMI programming, but I was hoping to learn more about controls. In the industrial world, it seems to be all about PID all the time (and it was such when I went to school too), and I want to go beyond that.

I was looking at perhaps doing a chem or electrical engineering degree and focusing on the controls aspects. Is that something that's reasonable to do in my situation?

50,What would you do? Consulting vs Govt job offers,1599269816,"Background: I'm a traffic engineer and urban planner. I have 5 years of full-time consulting experience, 2 years construction management experience, and ~2 years part-time internship experience. 

I'm happy-ish now at my consulting job. My boss loves me. I've become a mid-level leader on two teams (traffic and planning). But i'm so sick though of the corporate BS, of billing my time, of worrying about utilization goals and ""winning work"", of always feeling under the gun, of working 45-50+ hours/week every week. 

But, the job pays well. Decent base salary with a NICE 401k match and a NICE bonus at the end of the year (like...25% of my annual salary nice). And the company claims that if you keep performing well (see previous paragraph) that that % can increase, with the eventual promise of being a shareholder, etc. etc. 

But, I have an offer in hand to work for The City. It's a really cool new position: they need someone to lead their downtown transportation plan and regional transitway projects. I'd love the work. Base salary is about $4k more than my current consulting base salary. Benefits are good in terms of medical, vacations, etc. Nothing crazy but they will do. The govt job would come with a pension. 

It's a govt job though, so the main pros and cons are there: no annual bonus and no real room for negotiation on salary (it's a unionized position with strict pay rules based on experience, not performance). But work-life balance is much easier; people rarely work more than 40 hours/week. 

What would you do?

53,"The current in my circuit isn't flowing until I check the impedance with my multimeter, what type of fault is this and how can I fix it?",1599264221,"So for context, I have been doing my high school science fair for 3 years. My project has been a wrist mounted electromagnetic energy harvester. The idea is that with a simple tube that has copper wiring wound around it, and a spherical magnet placed inside, a simple induction generator can be built that is driven by the kinetic motion of walking. Out of the 5 designs, one has worked flawlessly (the first) and it used a single tube/loop with a single magnet connected to a diode-capacitor-resistor (DCR) circuit. My next design flopped due to poor design.

However, the third, fourth, and fifth design all have the same problem (or so it seems). They all have multiple loops connected to a single DCR circuit. The fourth design has two loops connected to the terminal. The fifth has two loops in parallel and then connected to the circuit. The third is just four loops, with two sets of two loops in parallel, and each set is connected like they are in the fourth design.

The issue is that after moving the magnet (in the proper direction as the capacitor is polar), and taking a voltage reading from the capacitor with my multimeter, nothing is shown. However, when I check the impedance between the cathode of the diode directly after the resistor, it shows a gradual climb to two Ohms, then flashes 0, then shows another climb to 20 ohms, and flashes 0 again. Then i can take an accurate reading of the voltage stored in the capacitor. I don't know what type of wiring fault this is or how to fix it. Any insight would be much appreciated and I'll credit you in my paper.

At the same time, I  have another interview for a program within the company that lets you spent a year or so in a different department for 3 years before choosing a department to stay on.

Our company needs lots of parts to go through stress analysis to ensure they are up to the job. Currently this means paying a lot of money for third party engineers to perform FEA or to verify mine (I can use the software to a basic extent). 

[my company's proposal]
The company have suggested that I am put through the required education to make me 'qualified' to make decisions based on my FEA. They have said they will pay for it and I could attend courses in a day-release format if required. This would mean that we wouldn't need to use a 3rd party for the FEA. I expect that I may also be asked to do manual calculations for some jobs. 

[what this means for me] 
This is essentially a career-changing opportunity for me but they have left it up to me to decide what makes a person 'qualified' to perform FEA. I'm sure there are loads of online FEA courses which would be great for learning FEA itself, but my gut instinct says that someone should really have a degree in engineering before they could generally be considered a professional FEA engineer. But then I went to see who companies are hiring, and I don't see a degree as a requirement for all  FEA positions so I don't really know.

[my question to you / TL;DR]
What qualifications would you consider to be necessary before you trust the conclusions of someone's FEA, and so that someone doing a professional review would come to the conclusion that the person is suitably qualified to be making those decisions?
It may be that all that's needed is an online course and plenty of experience. If so I would love to see any online course recommendations you have. My case is also somewhat unique in that my employer will let me choose the course and they will pay for it (for which I'm really grateful). This sort of makes me want to go the route of a degree if that's reasonable, since it would be a great thing to have on my CV. But I would need to justify it to them first.

76,How should I navigate my masters in systems engineering?,1599249120,"Hello friends.  Recently I graduated with a masters in systems engineering which was sponsored by my engineering firm that I've been with for over 8 years as a systems engineer.  When I first graduated college and brought on board - they had told me I barely made the 12 month window which apparently is a timer that starts as soon as you get your initial degree.  After 12 months, I would no longer be competitive as a new round of new grads would be available to choose from.  Made sense.

Following my masters program, I learned several things:

1. This does not automatically bump my seniority, pay, or responsibilities - nor does it accelerate the prospects of a promotion. 
2. An inline promotion would be highly unlikely due to the current pandemic-ridden economy.
3. Leaving the company would require a sizable portion of the tuition to be returned.  Therefore, I do not consider this an option.  

Given the information above, I have the following questions:

* Does this 12 month timer apply to a masters degree?  Is there even one?  If so, what's the amount?
* If there is a timer, how aggressively should I be pursuing a new position to leverage the degree?
* Anyone who has been in a similar position, could you please share your thoughts &amp; experience?

89,Thoughts on starting out with a lab technician role in the COVID era?,1599240149,"TL/DR: does COVID change the viability of a technician role for a new grad?

Recent ME grad here. Like many other young engineers graduating into the current hiring slump, I'm having a hard time scoring interviews. Sifting through hundreds of entry-level job postings has been an exercise in reluctantly lowering my standards despite having a couple of internships under my belt, a solid GPA, and a CAD/CAE portfolio. What I've always loved about engineering is the thrill of applying my understanding of engineering principles to solve hands-on problems. My internships and job sifting have shown me how little this actually happens in the wild--I think I've made peace with that, but part of me is holding on to the dream.

This brings me to my question. I know how r/AskEngineers feels about technicians, but I wondered if there's any argument to be made for using such a role as a springboard into either an R&amp;D engineering career or a research assistantship in a Master's program. I don't even know if I would be any more qualified because of my BSME, but I'm wondering whether this would be a career dead-end notwithstanding my 100+ fruitless applications to ""engineer"" roles. If it weren't for the salary discrepancy, I imagine I'd happily be a technician the rest of my life, but for now it seems like a place I can get hands-on experience that might lead elsewhere when the economy picks up.

I wanted to run this idea by the community especially given the current slowdown of the US job market that looks unlikely to speed up soon. 


Here's a more specific profile of me:

BSME and BA German Language from an accredited university, GPA 3.6

HVAC tech for 3 summers; Construction Project Engineering Intern for 1; Automotive Quality Engineering Intern for 1. Capstone project leader and chief designer, using CAD, CFD, FEA, circuit design.

91,Design of spring tensioned wheel mechanism for cable length measurement,1599237455,"I am currently designing the mechanism which will be used to measure cable lengths and have decided, following a couple of iterations, to move away from using a hinge and springs to hold the 2 sides together and instead use a 1 piece folded metal frame that will house both wheels, axles and encoder.

I have taken some images of the initial main frame which can be seen holding the 2 wheels, however I know it cannot simply have the 2 wheels on rods through the frame (it will have locking collars on the rods to keep the wheel centred and the wheels will be locked to the rods so they turn together). I am unsure what options there are or what best practice would be to allow the wheel, which will be tensioned by springs to the static wheel, to move freely back and forward when cable is being fed through the 2 wheels without wearing on the frame. The wheel cannot be allowed to turn on the rod as it will wear the inside of the wheel too fast as it is only thick up to 12mm with an 8mm hole drilled for the rod. One thought was to have a bearing locked to the rod outside of the frame and a pill shaped platform around it which would allow the inside of the bearing to hold the spinning rod but the outside to move back and forward with the wheel without the rod itself resting on the frame slot.

Any guidance would be appreciated or if I am just wrong and need to redesign it all to be different then that's fine too,  all criticism is welcome.

25,Boy oh boy do I hate my job. Is this normal? (Rant),1599196142,"tldr; 2020 grad at new job with big company. Miserable and bored, edit documents for 9 hours a day. Am I the only one?

Background: Recent 2020 grad lucky to have a job where I interned at last summer (large Aerospace company). I majored in a completely unrelated engineering field relative to my job. Last summer's experience as an intern was horrendous; I edited documents and looked up specifications for parts the company was using in our database (which is just the worst, so confusing and hard to find things). I would either get the task done relatively quickly and ask for more work... And get to do the same thing over again, OR not have had enough training on navigating the database, to which I'd just have to ask for help finding things (which I felt bad for bothering the other guys). I was miserable, probably some depression at work if I think about it. After nine hours I'd often get home and cry because I was so bored, and so tired and miserable. I'm sure that sounds weird to many, but I was not in a good place to say the least. But I thought, ""hey, I'm an intern. Maybe this is normal only for interns?"" Nope

I started as a full time hire last week. Yeah sure you might say it's too early to tell if I like the job or not, but let me tell you, I'm in the same group I was in last summer doing the exact same shit. Originally I was gonna be in a more hands on testing group, but COVID19 wasn't satisfied with just fucking up my graduation now was it.  So that group got dismantled. SO I'm back where I was last summer, only I'm doing more document editing, more looking up specifications in our convoluted, confusing database, and I'm sick of it. Already. There's people in my group who've been here for 20 years doing the EXACT same thing as me.  I asked my friend who went to the same school/major as me working for the same company what they're working on, and they're doing actual engineering! Making computational models, lots of coding and fun stuff! Not only am I jealous, but I can't help but feel I have terrible luck with this sort of thing. I guess you could say I'm a natural pessimist, but this can't be normal can it? For a large company like this? If I didn't move back in with my family where they can make me food, do laundry, etc I'd probably quit the job real soon or jump off the deep end. Unfortunately I don't say that lightly. I've been pretty miserable the past few years with school being incredibly stressful and personal issues, but I've never been as miserable as I was/am working in this group editing and looking up documents for 9 hours a day. 

I guess I'm just trying to see if this is normal, and hopefully take comfort in me not being the only one who's unhappy.

27,Project Ideas/Sites &amp; General Advice for Recent Graduates,1599194502,"Firstly, how are you doing? And secondly, sorry for the long post. This wasn't meant to be this long, but now it is.

As the title states, I recently graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a concentration in Aerospace in May of this year. I had an average 3.4 GPA, and I never was able to get an internship – or an engineering job for that matter.

I gave up searching for jobs just last month, and I am wondering now what I can do in the meantime to practice what I've learned in school. I have been working a side-gig full time in the meantime, and I am planning on taking the FE exam in the near future, so that's already fewer things to worry about.

\---

I have a budget (that I am currently working on building) of about $1,500 (USD) max for a project or a set of projects. The project(s) can be Mechanical/Aerospace/Computer Engineering or Computer Science related. I don't have many shop tools at my disposal, so I would have to buy some tools as well.

I've worked on circuit-building, mechanical design, CAD, manufacturing (machining, CNC, welding, etc) and on aerodynamics of aircraft. As for code, I know MATLAB, Python, and C++. I also live in a large city in the USA and just got my first car, so I have mobility and should have ease of access to most materials.

\---

As for advice, what should I do during this pandemic? My mom keeps telling me to go into graduate school now while I'm still fresh out of college. I've heard from others that now is the best time for me to get into grad school, be it the pandemic, just the mere fact I would still be in the school mindset, or for other reasons. To be honest, I would go back to school if it wasn't for the fact I have student loans to pay off and that I would have to scramble to find three recommendations just to apply to a school. I would probably end up paying $2,000 a month for loans (including my new car loan) on top of tuition and rent if I were to go to school again.

On the topic of finances, I know most people actually go to grad school as part of a job benefit, so is it also true that scholarships for graduate studies are scarce since you're expected to be a working adult by then? And what are fellowships like? I know some grad students use these instead of scholarships.

Instead of going to grad school (or in addition to) are there any \*useful\* (engineering or otherwise) skills I should pick up while I wait for the pandemic to be over? I've looked through many online course sites ([Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com), [coursera.org](https://coursera.org), [edx.org](https://edx.org)) , but so far all I can find are programming, management, Six Sigma, video editing, creative writing, LEED certification, and CAD tutorials.

I already know CAD; I've used it on multiple projects during my undergrad. I'm not planning on designing buildings, so LEED may not be useful to know. Six Sigma keeps getting thrown around, but its usefulness is always debated. I'm not going to get started on creative writing. Project management seems to be useful enough, so I've started that.

\---

I would like to keep applying for jobs, but the severe lack of responses to all the 60 applications I sent in the two months before quitting was quite honestly disheartening. I may just put it on pause until the pandemic is over or until I hear things are going better for recent graduates.

That brings me to another point. Are we expected to know anything? Every time I apply to a job I feel stupid. I'm not going to lie here and say I know some things, because I really think I don't. I only know what I was taught in school, and to be completely honest, everything I see on job listings looks like a bunch of mumbo jumbo. Maybe it's the lingo/jargon/slang, but I have no idea what most of what appears on a job listing is. I see posts here on this very subreddit about this same topic, and I don't know if y'all are joking or if we really don't know what we're doing until 50+ years later.

\---

I don't come from an affluent family or a family with members that have gone to college, nor do I know any real-life engineers, which is why I am posting this here. I would like to know what it is real engineers do and how they think, so that I don't feel surprised when I enter the workforce if at all.

Thank you for taking the time to read all this!

\---

TL;DR:

Need a list of potential projects / good sites with ideas.

Should I go to graduate school, apply for jobs, etc?

What skills should I learn?

I feel dumb reading job listings. Is that normal?

I'm interested in how a 4 port 2 way valve works.

I'm thinking of a log splitter attached to the hydraulics in a tractor. Hoping someone can help.

I'm trying to learn so correct me if Is ay anything wrong.

Ok, so you have one pipe coming from the hydraulic valve in the tractor to the log splitter.

And another valve from the log splitter going into the tractor. Flow and return.

The flow valve goes to a control valve block to operate the log splitter.

From looking online, I would say a 4 port, 2 way valve would work it. With valve operation on the control valve block, the flow from the tractor extends the cylinder of the log splitter and then the flow returns to the tractor. To reverse it the valve is switched and the flow and return lines are switched.

So far so good?

But this is where I get stuck and need help figuring it out. If I wanted the cylinder to auto return after I extend it, is it an auto relief valve I need? Do the hydraulic systems all have them or do you have to buy certain models? Is the return line connected to the relief valve line?

Or is it just a spring return you need on the valve control unit to retract the cylinder?

I understand that if we were to add more components (say a second light bulb) we would be forced to recalculate at different segments and the entire system would change-so at the end of the circuit it doesn't matter if the electrons technically do possess potential energy or not, but I am just confused how they would be different than electrons ""upstream""

98,"I need a smooth fitting for a 3/4"" stainless steel pipe",1599116050,"Hey everyone,

I am currently on an assignment to find a way to transport solid flammable material from a plastic bag into a vessel via a vacuum pump. This is done with a stainless steel pipe with several holes punched in it. The issue we are running into is the bags tearing and spilling toxic material into the room. This is a result of the operator leaving the pump running for too long and pulling the bag as tightly as it will go before making a hole. I suggested lowering the pressure, but after some experimentation, we saw that the pressure has to be just strong enough to pull the material out, which is still strong enough to tear the bag. The bags are outsourced and cannot be changed. Some bags are tougher than others. 

The main cause is the tube is thin and sharp at the bottom. We are willing to change the material of the tube if it resolves everything. We can't use anything insulating because the tube can gather static buildup, and can cause hazards for the material, as it is flammable. The vessel it ends up in is grounded for this reason. The tube itself is not grounded, and is detachable, with a plastic hose with a metal wire running through it, allowing all of the current to flow out to the grounding cable attached to the vessel. 

So we need one of two things: 

New, conductive, material that can act as a pipe for solid flammable material.

An attachment that can be placed on the end of a 3/4"" stainless steel pipe with a dull end to prevent cutting.

4,I finally got a job offer with great benefits at a small company but now I am having second thoughts after accepting it for some reason. Am I being unreasonable? (I hope so),1599108941,"After graduating this year with a B.S. in mechanical engineering, I finally got a job offer!

**Starting salary:** $75K plus benefits

**Interviews done:** only 1 and that was onsite with the upper management

**company size:** \~10

During the interview, the CEO told me how much they liked my resume and how I smiled in my linkedin profile (um) and was looking forward to my interview the most out of all the applicants and the interview confirmed that I knew what I was talking about (they only asked me couple of questions). He offered me the job halfway through and I was stunned, gave me the salary that I wanted, and continued talking about the benefits while I tried to process what just happened. After months and months of applying to jobs and going through rounds and rounds of interviews only to get rejected and ghosted, I was just speechless. Before leaving, I was told the offer letter will be in my inbox before I even reach home (which was true).

**A little about me:**

\- minority and a woman (hooray for diversity hiring)

\- I also come with 18 months of relevant experience and the position aligns really well with my background in product design, development, and production

**About the company:**

\-products for DoD customers and looking to expand commercially

\-all the engineers are white men

\-there's only one other MechE who will be my senior and also worked at the company where i did my internships (also another reason why the hiring manager wanted me)

\-very fast paced and a lot of responsibilities will be placed on our shoulders

\-more than a decade years old but most of the team joined &lt;2 years ago

\- 45 hour workweek

\-made the employees come back in May because remote work during corona was slowing everything down and would have caused lay offs

After the excitement and relief died down, I was alone with my thoughts once again. I talked to my mentor from past internship and they said the fast process is normal for small companies. After thinking and thinking I basically gave myself a panic attack (and started crying). 

It could be because: I'm PMSing ( i really hope this is it); I feel like Im being scammed lmao (unlikely because they're an established defense contractor); I would probably do shit job; not culturally fit; being the only woman; etc

The job sounds like I will be learning a lot and I will be wearing a lot of hats since it's a small company and I really love that. I am blessed to find a relevant job for my career. But let's say I don't end up liking it because of company values, management style, no support system, etc. It could also be because I went from chilling at home since March with no stress aside from having to find a job to starting a new, fast paced job next week. If I end up not liking it, should I stay for at least 2 years anyways? Am I being worried for no reason? I just want to be happy about the news but I can't. I told my parents all this and they assured me it's normal what Im feeling when starting a new job - I hope so.

What's your experience like working in a small company? Especially as a woman (if it applies)?

20,Strength of shelf increases with linear length of it?,1599092665,"Let's say you make a shelf out of an angle iron. Just as an example, say it is 1.5ft x 1ft x 1ft (it is a 1ft angle iron that is 1.5ft long). You attach it to a wall with some sort of infinitely strong adhesive and then center a 2ft x 1ft x 1ft block on it that weighs a lot but not quite enough to shear off the leg of the angle iron and fall to the ground. Both the block and angle iron are super rigid and flat.

Now, say you cut out the middle half of the angle iron so you effectively have two smaller angle irons at each end, but the legs are still 1ft x 1ft. It's just that there is now this gap in the middle, so there is less for the block to rest on.

The continuous angle iron could barely hold the block without the leg snapping off, but can this new angle iron do the same?

I'm trying to figure out if the length of a ""shelf"" adds any strength conceptually (even if it is just a tiny bit of strength). I have a feeling that there might be a counter-intuitive concept here, kind of like how a solid rod won't deflect any less than a pipe of the same diameter.

21,Clamp or something for stability between two steel beams,1599092631,"Hi,
I trying to put a frame up made of 75x50 RHS. There's two uprights bolted to the floor and a crossbeam over the top about 3m high. The middle of the top crossbeam is about 200mm from another vertical pole that I'm hoping to secure the frame onto for horizontal stability only - not to bear weight. It's just to stop the frame for leaning forward or back.

So I'm looking for an adjustable double sided clamp thing to clamp onto the crossbeam of the frame and the pole. Something that has clamps on either side that can be tightened or loosened. And the distance between the clamps can be shortened or lengthened up to a max as required. I don't want to drill into the pole (but into the frame is ok)

Thanks for taking the time to help out. I’m a bit stuck and really just need a pros help.

I’m trying to match a filter to a fan for a homemade flowhood. These are used in mycological applications but so far it’s proving to be a headache since advice/forums/message boards all seem to use different terminology/units of measurement depending on where you are. 

My goal is to achieve at least 100fpm at the face of the filter. This would be about 0.5m/s. I’d like to work in metric, but it constantly changes between the two systems depending on who builds the fan. 

So, this is my current problem.  

I require 0.5m/s at the filter face.  To get the volume I found the area of the filter to be 61cm*30.5cm. This is 1830cm3 or 1.83m3. I multiply 1.8 * 0.5 and get 915m3/h or 15.25 m3/m. 

Using the resistance of the filter given at that flow rate in the spec sheet attached, the resistance is about 90pa for 0.5m/s (assumed as they just put title). 

Using the fan curve of the attached fan spec, the 900m3/h fan doesn’t have the guts to provide 0.5 m/s of airflow. This fan is only suitable to provide just under 600m/3 with that pressure drop.

However, my problem is I’ve got the fan and filter and it seems to work fine. It nearly blows out a match when I put one infront of the filter and my cheap anemometer reads higher than 0.5 m/s. 
What am I missing? What the hell don’t I get? I’ve gone over this a dozen times and it’s not getting me anywhere. Any help I’d be incredibly grateful.

2. ""Virtual ISO"" and ""Virtual shutter speed."" The first works where the nominal ISO can be different than end output. If in RAW, the ""push"" and pull"" factor from the nominal ISO can be adjusted; it's a form of tone mapping. The second one captures multiple frames for averaging. In each pixel, there's a buffer for storing the exposures made after the ADC. When done, the individual pixel does an average **before** the demosaicing. This will be designed with motion picture in mind. All this can be automated with or without knowledge from the user.
3. Users can set the virtual ISO and virtual shutter speed. The camera will automatically adjust the nominal settings as needed. The function can be disabled by the user if desired.

36,How Often to Check In With Potential Employers?,1599076610,"Question is in the title. Back in March I began emailing with the manager for a local mechanical controls consultant, and even visited the office and talked for a bit, and we seemed to hit it off well. After checking in a week later, thanking for the time and everything, he mentioned that many construction projects were cancelled due to the pandemic. So I checked in a few months later just to see if anything’s changes, same answer. It’s now been 3 months since my last email, and I want to check in again to see if they’d be open to taking me on, but I’m scared of 1) Seeming desperate and 2) bugging them. They have been fairly active on LinkedIn posting about successful recently completed projects, etc, so business can’t be that bad... 

TL;DR: company has been sort of keeping me on the hook, blaming the pandemic for lack of projects, and hence cant hire me. Should I bail, or check in again?

38,What should I negotiate when leaving to a smaller firm for more experience?,1599075471," 

Hello, I'm looking for some advice or things to think about in a decision I'm trying to make about leaving my firm or not. I am not a civil engineer, but a CAD tech, though I feel like it's safe to assume many of you have been in my position.

TLDR; I've got a good setup right now but I am not growing and the company has little more to offer in terms of training, so when I am offered a job with plenty of training from great engineers, I feel like the choice is clear. Now I need to know what to demand out of the new job or expect out of it in order that everyone wins, including myself.

I'm a CAD tech at a decent sized firm (48 people total) and am currently training under the Survey tech of 30 years that is retiring soon. Not to brag but to show my value, I was taught and fully capable at working with pipe networks in 1 day, became the fastest survey tech at a previous survey company in 3 months having no prior experience with survey or CAD, very ambitious and work the late hours... When I carpet bombed craigslist with my resume another firm contacted me telling me they'd keep my resume in case they are hiring later; they contacted me offering to bump my pay from 18 to 25, financial help with school, and he's hoping to get someone (winked at me) to replace him once he retires in 6-10 years. My company counter offered with the same pay and $3000 a year towards school and a slowly working me to be a civil tech (design grading, pipe networks, corridors, etc.) once they find someone to replace me to be the survey tech. I elected to stay because: ""a bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush."" and the offer seemed nice enough, plus I love my company.

Time comes for them to fulfill that promise and here I am almost a year later doing my 1000'th topo, with plenty of time to be moved to the civil team and they've done naught. No searching for a new survey tech either. The other firm comes back and is trying again to get me, and they have a new engineer (2 total, 7 people in the firm total) that would be a great teacher and they plan to train me to be a civil CAD Designer within the next couple months and my pay would reflect that ($35+ i hope), until I finish school in 2 years, get my license, and hopefully PE up soon.

My questions are: What do I negotiate in with this transition? The other firm doesn't have retirement plans, they do have benefits. How can I hold these guys accountable to their promises so that a repeat of my current job doesn't happen? Would it be reasonable to ask for more money towards my schooling? I would hope for a little more than $3k a year but I don't want to be unreasonable. What do you expect out of your CAD Designers that work in Civil 3d? What are they paid?

I’m a senior and high school and applying for college. All of my HS career I’ve always thought I wanted to do science and engineering.

I had left this position to pursue another opportunity, but due to COVID that did not pan out. Since March, I have been out of work and have been officially job searching since mid-June.

One of the big gripes of my old job was that I was a glorified technician/handyman and that I wasn't able to take on exciting or challenging projects. I have been interested in Design Engineering and have been using this time to pursue these kinds of positions. The job market is obviously quite competitive, so getting my foot in the door for a Design Eng job is proving a tad challenging.

I expect to receive an offer this week for a Design Engineer position in a great industry and company, however the work is not very technical. For the area I would be working on, the products are already established, so very little actual design work is done by us. Most of the job seems to revolve around working w/ sales and customers to identify design requirements, create quotes and drawings for the customer, and providing and/or creating documentation for supply chain and manufacturing.

I like the company, appreciate that they're currently WFH, and appreciate their products and mission, but I worry that this position may not be as effective in getting my foor in the 'Design Engineer' door as I'm hoping. I worry that if I take this job and want to pursue a more technical role later on, potentially at another company, my lack of hard technical skills could be a future barrier for entry.

On the other hand, they were pretty cool to let me go to part time, especially since the customer-facing part of my job had to be nixed because I am not here every day. They even let me keep insurance for 2 weeks which was very kind.

Then again, they really did not need me here full time. Even when we are really busy I was able to keep the dept afloat with my 2 days. I think the new manager is starting to get wise on how slow things can be in engineering, I hope he would agree that me being full time would be pretty excessive.

Has anyone ever backtracked? I don't know what to do to be honest, I’m heavily leaning towards EE right now but I’m afraid of financial repercussions. I also feel like I keep making decisions based on limited exposure, everything only seems clearer in hindsight. Please reach out if you’ve had similar situations.

As for further elaboration: Financial repercussions include excess credit surcharges from my university, running out of aid to cover said surcharges. Some other things too such as price of education and whether to get a second bachelors or go for a masters.

As for which one I like more– well I didn't realize until this summer that I like the idea of tinkering with electronics or designing a device more than I did than designing a building. The BME orientation class did a piss-poor job of making the career seem anything other than healthcare-oriented rather than an interdisciplinary fusion of chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineering. It was boring and not a hands-on class at ALL. 

I'd also say some of the theories that I liked in the math classes I took seem to line up more explicitly in EE than I guess in civil. Idk whether that means I should just go for an applied math degree instead of just doing engineering, but I always felt the need to do the latter because I like the idea of *making* something. And not just to design something, but *make* it as well. I was always deciding between the three– whether I wanted to do civil, or EE, or BME, and for a while it seemed like I was going to stick with BME until a *profoundly* negative experience in a research lab caused me to prefer and later hyper-fixate on civil. Now two semesters in, and I wanna backtrack and explore more courses related with other fields, but with a heavy focus on EE. I should have known better, but I made an impulsive and short-sighted decision and now I feel stuck with a major I don't \*really\* like.

69,I’ve been working for 3 months and my job is treating me like I’ve worked there for 3 years. Can I leave?,1599048373,"Hi all, I’m on mobile so I apologize if the formatting is weird. This is also a throwaway account. 

I started at my job back in June. I interned there last summer and everyone told me how they enjoyed the work, and i really enjoyed what i was doing too. I accepted their return offer and was excited to start! 

Until... they did a complete 180 and I come to find that  so many of my work friends have left and those who are still there are planning to leave in the next year. I figured “eh, everyone has to move on I guess.” But that was until the day after I got there, I was immediately thrown into tasks that were way out of my league. Now typically people usually are deemed useless for the first few months of work and are given hand holding tasks and lots of training. NOT HERE. I have been given so many tasks that require years of experience and I have told my manager this, instead they give me a mentor and they just give me an example to copy, but I feel I still miss information. Everyone is so overworked that they quickly glance over things and I worry that something bad will happen down the line and I’ll get in trouble even though my manager was telling me to do it.

It’s gotten to the point where I’ve asked my manager “Are you sure my capabilities allow me to successfully complete this work?” And he says “Well, we need someone’s name on the signature line.” 

At this point, I’m just at a loss for words. I feel like most people my age are complaining that they don’t have enough work, meanwhile I’m drowning in it. I enjoy the people I work with, but the work itself makes me miserable and I feel awful every time I go to work. But with my lack of experience, I feel I’m stuck here for 2 years or at least until I get promoted from a new engineer. 

Is there any hope for me getting out sooner? Has anyone left their first job with little experience and found a new one? How do they explain that they left so early without badmouthing their previous company in an interview?

I was dealing with a problem at work regarding volume flow proving and measurement which led me to the title's question. A field flowmeter like ultrasonic, magmeter, coriolis, etc; take discrete measurements and integrate them to create a ""totalization"". I was wondering how does it do that? Because I had just two points registered in the flowmeter and I couldn't find a way to obtain the same value as the flowmeter's totalizer: wasn't possible with rectangular rule or trapezoidal rule (which are the applicable for just two points)

And this questions led me to the other one: when a DCS or a SCADA receive a 4-20mA signal from a flowmeter, how does it totalize it? Is there a method installed by the manufacturer that allows this? Or the field service programmer applies whatever method seem to be okay?

I mean, for two points we don't have choice, but when the number of points start to increase, we have plenty of options limited only by the computer's capacity of processing this data.

95,Is it bad for the battery to keep a cell phone constantly plugged in the car?,1599006794,"I have trouble understanding what a battery cycle is. From what I understand, so far, each time you charge a battery it's a cycle. So is it correct to say that if a cell phone battery should last 1000 cycles, I can charge it 1000 times until it is dead?

The problem is I like Waze so much when in my car, that I use it all the time to avoid traffic and stuff like that. But it kills my battery. So I thought about plugging my cell phone in my auxiliary power outlet with an adapter. But I'm not sure what it would do to the battery. If the phone charges every time it is plugged, wouldn't it mean it would charge-uncharge-charge-uncharge-charge-uncharge constantly? Let's say I plug it and it's at 50%, wouldn't it be sort of a competition between Waze (or Google Maps) and the charger?

If it's bad to keep it plugged because it constantly charges and uncharge, is there a way to keep it plugged without charging the battery, only using what is coming from the auxiliary power outlet?

Bottom line, I wouldn't like to kill my battery because of an app.

96,Is there a demand for engineers with a masters degree in Systems Engineering?,1599006285,"Hi everyone, 

I wanted to get some career advice before I make a huge decision. I was just started a master’s degree program for systems engineering. But I have some last-minute hesitation and I wanted to hear what others have to say. 

Some background on myself: I have a B.S. in industrial engineering, and I have 1 year of full time experience in the defense industry as a simulations systems engineer where I code all day.  I have had some experience with systems engineering courses in my undergrad studies such as UML diagrams, risk analysis, V-models, and requirement writing. They were ok topics to learn, but I wouldn’t say I’d make a career out or them. 

My main motivation for earning a master’s is to increase my salary in the short term and help me enter senior-level roles in the long term. I ended up choosing the systems engineering program to apply to because the thought of being a project manager appealed to me. Plus, I noticed that in my company, everyone’s title is systems engineers regardless of background. I don’t want to be tied down to my company though, and I want the flexibly to move industries and jobs. My co-workers from other defense companies say that systems engineering heavily prevalent, but when I look at the job search results for companies like Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman, pretty much no senior or principal level job posting even talks about a MS in Systems engineering being a requirement. Can anyone give their experience with systems engineering in any industry, defense or not? Are there any positives to earning a MS in systems engineering that I’m not aware of?
