I am a year out of school I was assigned to design a conveyance system and kept messing up. The PE I am working with has showed some frustration with me not being thorough enough with reading the manual (I started off with using different “n” value when doing the rational method). This happened early on in the design process and I got anxiety from the first mistake I’ve done that it set me up for a rough rest of the road. We finally figured it out but I just feel so incompetent for the job. It was my first time really using the manual and navigating through it efficiently wasn’t as easy as I expected it would be.

19,At a career Crossroad for a Soon to be Grad.,1556900482," I'm a Senior student at university who graduates Fall 2019 who is deciding between jobs. I'm very thankful to be in this situation, but I'm at a cross roads.

Just started at a san diego county company as an Electrical Engineering intern. Myrole reals in firmware for iot light fixtures. Been learning a lot and currently developing a bootloader for a product to aid technicians on the field. This is a smaller company and my pay reflects it. Without throwing numbers out I can definitely pay rent and live comfortable, but Im living pay check to paycheck. This role will let me stay 9 months. I started this role with the potential to move into a Real EE role, but Ive noticed some issues. Which I will highlight below:

\- Recently hired 3 new firmware engineers and I saw the job description. If I'm being honest with myself, I'm simply not at that level as of yet. 

\- The younger hires seems to be people who might not be US citizens and based on the cars they are driving it really doesn't look like they are getting paid much.

If offered a true EE position I wouldn't be surprised if I get 60K started out as a new grad.

I'm 26 years old and honestly 60K is not my ideal salary after the sacrifices I've done to put myself through school.  At the same time, I'm an Electrical Engineering developing firmware which is exciting. 

So after working as a EE intern for a month, A well established Defense Contractor on the East Coast gave me a call and offered me a position. The pay is a 25% increase and it includes a living stipend. This is a summer gig that can extend a few months. The downside, IMO, is my title is Systems Engineer whom don't seem to have the most technical roles. From my understanding I'l be doing simulations in MatLab. Here are a few highlights of why this position can potentially be amazing. 

\- More pay which will allow me to pay off student debt

\- A foot in the door of the Defense Industry. I have many friends who have gotten hired at this same company and they are starting at 75K to 80K. Furthermore friends have been offered full-time positions after completing internship

\- This is really important to me, work/life balance. They work extra hours to allow them a 3 day weekend every other Friday. 

\- Will pay for masters

On paper, I dont know what else I could ask for. Good starting salary and I could go for a Masters. I love the work/life balance, I'm not an over achiever tbh and I want my spare time to work on cars (my hobby). Would have to move out of state, but would potentially ask for a transfer after graduation and cheaper cost of living for this time frame. The real negative is would I be happy showing up everyday essentially being a project manager who organizes documents and data. 

I know my choice isn't the end all be all for my career, but I love this idea of being a firmware engineer. I also want to start my life. Live on my own and have a family. It sounds more realistic with a government contracting. Would love some opinions and I appreciate your time.",AskEngineers,False,Chonyboy12,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bkacad/at_a_career_crossroad_for_a_soon_to_be_grad/

35,ME - Worthless Intern?,1556856735,"I am in a bit of a dilemma, and would like to reach out to the community of experience and see what you guys think. I will try to keep it brief. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started an internship on Apr 1 through a co-op program at my school. I am currently an ME Junior.  I received the initial call from my mentor at the Aerospace Metals Manufacturing Facility in mid-March. Although I would be relocating about 1.5 hours from my home at my expense(mortgage + rent), I was excited at the opportunity. I have about 11 years experience as an aviation mechanic, so I felt this was right in my lane. 

&amp;#x200B;

After no further communication from the company, I called my mentor about 10 days before I was set to begin. He informed me that his job had changed, and I was being reassigned to a different ME.  Day 2 (after orientation) I hang out in the Engineering department for a few hours, then new mentor tells me he has another intern, and two new employees and will be too busy for me. Passes me to 'Jerry' the manager of west operations. He becomes my immediate supervisor. He has never had an intern, unfamiliar with the co-op program, or what an Engineer really does (although I am also somewhat unfamiliar, as this is my first venture into the real world)

&amp;#x200B;

Jerry is busy, so he passes me off to the floor supervisor.  Floor supervisor manages the workers, and so he has me work the floor with the guys to learn the process. I do not mind this at all (maintenance background). About a week passes by, and then I get passed to the Recovery Analyst (as now I am familiar with the process, although in reality I have a faint grasp).  The Recovery Analyst job is to fix paperwork on parts that have been messed up along the process, and continue them on their way (over 60 steps per part). He is a wizard on the process, and tells me that it takes about 6-12 months to train a guy to do anything on their own. So I help with whatever I can, but me trying to help (or learn something) involves impeding his work (1:5). I have been doing inventory on these lost parts and teaching myself (youtube) how to set up databases and logs for the last few weeks in order to produce something worthwhile. I can do some Matlab, but SQL is totally unfamiliar. 

&amp;#x200B;

Week 2 Friday co-op rep of company notices what I have been up to. Brings me to his office, informs me that he is disappointed on the outcome, and that I have somehow been lost in their system. He will try to get me reassigned to an actual ME by talking to Jerry's boss the Chief of Operations. I find out after a few days that COO will not release me, he thinks I can be of tremendous value to their problems. Eventually I was given a paper with some project goals COO had in mind. Heavy emphasis on Industrial Eng. type of stuff. Very vague items like ""improve efficiency, reduce lost parts, reduce man hours in this department..."" I ask my supervisor Jerry what any of it actually means and how I might implement it, and he says he didn't write it and is unfamiliar with the exact details. Jerry remains uninvolved and busy afterwards. I continue with inventory and making up work for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sit tight until the 4th week Friday, and I reach out to my original mentor. I explain all of my situation in greater detail. I thought things might change and get better over time, however I feel like if I say nothing, this will just continue for the six months I am here. Nothing learned, no engineering experience, twiddling my thumbs and making up odd jobs for myself. My impression is that the COO thinks I will somehow come up with something fantastic and save them a lot of money... and if I don't, well I was just an intern after all, no losses there. COO might benefit something, I will get nothing.

 

My original mentor understands the situation, and advises that I escalate the situation outside of the company (co-op headquarters). He believes that nothing will move if I don't squeak. I am apprehensive of escalating the situation beyond my control, and alienating people. Another idea that crosses my mind is that COO has no idea what I am actually up to, believes I am flourishing (Jerry reports to him, and reports must look good), and if I were to escalate things, this might blindside COO. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am at a loss of what to do. Original Mentor has not gotten back to me yet (about a week), I have nobody to reach out to, I am unfamiliar with the engineering world, and I do not know how to maneuver in this situation. Do I complain, shake the tree, and see what falls out? Do I accept my fate and make the best of it? Do I escalate manners beyond my control and alienate people, and possibly ruin the companies relationship with the Co-op program? I feel trapped but the idea of doing nothing at all also worries me, I do not want any regrets later.

Yes, it is *another* post about programming and its use in Mechanical Engineering, and more specifically Stress and CFD Analysis. I have read through all of the posts I could find in this sub (as well as r/AerospaceEngineering) and gathered what I could before coming to you. Though I have learned a great deal from this sub, I still have questions so if you have a moment I would **love** to hear what you have to say about programming in the ME profession!

I will be joining a large Aerospace defense contractor this summer as an Entry Level Stress &amp; CFD Analyst, as well as a Design Engineer (rotational program). Although I suck at it, I really do enjoy programming and FEA. I already know MATLAB enough to be able to debug fairly quickly, so I have chosen to take up Python and have a bit of fun in my spare time because I like python better. I have read many responses on here about programming being used for post-processing FEA and CFD results as well as defining a mesh for geometries and such but I find myself wondering two things: 

*1. What do ""post-processing"" and meshing really entail from a programming perspective?
 (I understand the uses and meaning of both, just not the actual method of programming for post-processing and meshing or what it really entails).

*2. How in the hell do I learn to do that?

I had two basic programming classes in college, one as an intro course into syntax and loops and the other about Numerical Methods (which I don't remember much of to tell you the truth). So what is the best place for me to start to learn how I can make use of Python and MATLAB in the workforce this summer?

I pushed through anyways being so close to the finish, graduated and got my first job. I was bright and hopeful thinking working would bring a new light and reignite my interest in engineering. I chalked up my breakdown to high stress and difficult classes.

45,Electric vs fuel cell question.,1556832525,"So this is a simple question

Internal combustion engines have a efficiency of around 30%, the rest is lost in noise, friction, light, heat...

And electrical cars are very efficient but the batteries are a problem, Weight, Thermal control (battery packs have to be mantained in a temperature range to work correctly), rare earth metals and recycling issues, not to mention refueling a electric car takes an hour at the best case (a battery which isnt fully drained to 85-90%).

and then you have the hydrogen fuel cell cars which still have a liquid fuel but containing hydrogen is problematic, it makes some metals and plastics brittle and its VERY hard to contain as it permiates many materials, also hydrogen is only a storage medium, you have to produce it from either methane or hydrolisys of water so it takes more energy then it produces. 

So...

Why hasnt anyone made a combination of them all.

Fuel cells have been used commercially since the days of the days of the start of the space race in the 60´s. they were expensive and required precious metals like paladium and platinium for the electrodes, but improvement in fuel tech has allowed companies like honda to mass produce them. 

the question is, whats stopping us from  using a fuel cell that would combust gasoline or LPG ?

The most efficient gasoline engines used in normal cars today get around 50-55 MPG or around 4L/100KM and thats in stable highway speeds,  

but with a fuel cell, wouldnt you bump efficiency from 30% to mid high 80´s ?

you could use it for gasoline, LPG, ethanol and it would more then double the milage of any car. 

Would make electric cars much cheaper and easier since you dont have a large, expensive battery pack that needs thermal controls. 

Also if a normal gas tank today in a normal sedan gets you around 500 miles, it would easily get you past 1200 miles, and would allow you to refuel the car in the same 5 min it takes to gas up a normal internal combustion engine car...

48,At a crossroad in my life. Can any engineers who worked in Europe and USA share their experiences with me?,1556825726,"This will be a bit of a long read but I will include a TL;DR at the end. The long passage while include some detailed information about the situation I’m in. Really I’m looking for life advice and career advice, but the meat of the career side of the question will be in the TL;DR.

Some background info:
I’m neither from Europe nor from the USA. I live in a small country with a weak economy where its standard for parents to pay their kid’s tuition.

 I’ve recently graduated with a bachelor in Power Engineering and I’ve been working as an intern at a Solar installation company for over a month now. The internship is unpaid which is standard for my country, but it has a job prospect which I don’t plan to take. The reason being is I’ve already applied to multiple Masters abroad and have been accepted.

I’ve gotten accepted in Europe and America. First for Europe: 
 I’ve gotten accepted into TUDelft (Netherlands) which is the best university I applied for. Was a great day I found out the news till I realized they require all expenses, tuition and living fees be paid for up front in a single bulk payment, totaling to 34k$. While possible to pay, it still is way too much for me to justify, or my parents since they’re the ones paying for my Masters.
The next university to send me their acceptance was Grenoble INP (France). This one offered a very cheap international Masters program, with tuition costing a mere 1:3 of what TUDelft does. While not as high as TUDelft, Grenoble is still a prestigious university and a great option. 

Now the USA:
So far I’ve applied in California only, I have gotten accepted into San Diego State’s electrical program and I’m waiting on San Jose’s State’s response. Both universities will cost me around 16k$ for being someone out of state, but living expenses are sure to cost more than Europe. I have heard plenty however that the job market for engineers is more rewarding in the USA and so I’ll be able to justify the costs post graduation.

Now due to financial preferences, my main choice is between Grenoble INP (France) or the USA, San Diego/San Jose. If anyone reading this has other preferences please share. In a few weeks I have to finalize my decision on where I should go and I’m internally still uncertain and confused.

For personal reasons I if I end up going to France, saving a lot of money in the process, after I graduate I may try to move to the USA through PHD or work.

So for any engineer reading this that has worked both in Europe and the USA, I’d appreciate any information about how your career can progress in the two different continents, and what your personal opinion is for what is better for my professional career. I’m interested in working with utility power, with top choice subjects being smart grids and renewables power generation.




TL:DR, I’m leaving my country to do a Masters and move abroad as an immigrant to either Europe or the USA. I’ve gotten accepted into a prestigious university in France and into a state university in California. I’m not sure which continent and path will provide me with a better future for my career and professional life as a power engineer interested in smart grids and renewable power generation. I’m looking for advice from someone who has worked in both continents.

60,Looking for acoustic diagnostic help,1556808057,"Trying to find a product that can help to isolate the source of a noise for diagnosis. Google brought up a bunch of phone apps which will be worthless because of the overall ambient noise already exceeding 120dB (limits of what a phone microphone can detect). Trying to be discreet with description below because I don't want to accidentally break an NDA or anything.

The system we are diagnosing consists of 12 fans. 4 of the fans are associated with a large amount of large ducting going into a large plenum and 2 large gas burners. The sound is intermittent, and can best be described as a howling noise, consistent with metal-on-metal contact, such as a fan contacting a fan shroud. The sound has persisted for several months now, is only present when the burners get everything up to temperature (200\*F and higher), and is intermittent. The system was installed approximately 4 months ago and no other similar systems exhibit these problems. There is no evidence in any of the fans making contact with their surroundings. None of the bearings are hot, but the theory has been floated that there may be bad bearings on the 2 largest fans. At this time the only way to verify that would be to replace the bearings - an estimated 2 days of downtime and $700 per bearing with 3 bearings per fan.

If possible, rather than throwing parts at a problem hoping that it goes away, I'd like to try to find some sort of equipment that can be purchased or rented that could help find the source of the noise. The current problem with finding the noise is that the ducting appears to be causing the sound to propagate and amplify in such a way that the human ear can only detect the noise at a location other than the origination of the sound.

70,"This is a pissy rant, but my question is... Will I be an incompetent engineer on the job? Does your job help/give you room to improve?",1556778270,"TLDR at bottom.. Question is is the title...

Hi all,

I am currently a university (in 3-4th year of 5 year course) student doing a double degree in civil engineering and science (human development, I know,completely unrelated).

Anyways I find that I'm not the worst at learning theoretical concepts, actually rather average if not slightly below, but not too hopeless.

What I do find however is that I am very slow at meeting deadlines, and it takes my brain longer to process solutions to a problem. In my group projects, I always start my parts early and somehow still manage to rush at the end. There are so many small details to consider, so much tedious details that I somehow miss as well, and I hate letting my team down. In addition to that, my coding skills are non existent, and I feel so far behind most of my peers when it comes to using engineering software. 

I've had a difficult time in my life for the last couple of years and nothing is being addressed because this course is taking all my time. I really do try, I work all day to get very little done, people would say study smarter and not harder but I just don't know how to with engineering.

In addition to this, all the tutors in these units have NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON THEMSELVES, and they  are seldom ever helpful in answering questions.

I just want to graduate for now, but what then? How will I fare on the job? Is it the same as uni? My University has prestige, and the content is very theory heavy, they don't really help us with careers as much as i'd like unless you are into academics.

I've been going through a difficult time in my life for a long time, family issues and such, delaying life goals such as forming relationships and obtaining work experience and nothing is being addressed because this course is taking all my time for little reward. Add to that expectation of others, the depression and anxiety developed from a string of failures, and you have the icing on the cake.

I thought Civil Engineering would be a good fit for me because I liked physics in school, and I liked everything relating to it in first year.

I lost so much motivation and enthusiasm for this course that all I think about now is the pay if i even get a job, which wasn't even a thought that crossed my mind because I'm not into money that much, but now I feel like I deserve it for all the fuel i wasted (like a shitty old car with bad mileage).

74,Unemployed petroleum engineer needs career advice,1556768276," 

Hi all,

I'm figuring things out

So, I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Petroleum Engineering in Cyprus.

I majored in engineering for my performance and love of math and physics. I chose petroleum, however, not for a particular reason except that it was a so-called better paying job (very dumb of me I know). Although I did great in it and scored the highest in tests and projects, I did not like it especially after doing internships that were terrible.

When I graduated, the oil and gas industry was hit hard because of oil prices and everyone was getting laid off, no entry-level employment. And so, I started working in customer service and then in IT as survival jobs.

A year later, I migrated to Toronto as I got sponsored by family.

Now, after a year and a half in Toronto, I have been working as a security and concierge because I was not able to find something meaningful in oil and gas in Alberta or other provinces; everything I find requires a lot of experience, and when it does not, it is a co-op for current students only.

After being registered with Professional Engineers Ontario as an Engineering Intern, I have been to a couple of newcomers' programs in the Toronto area, but all they offer is how to write a resume and how to perform in an interview (I’m good at both), and then, they have labor jobs, mid-level jobs, or unrelated jobs like machine operators or data entry clerks, etc.

At this point, considering that I liked programming in university with Matlab, C++, and Eclipse, I am thinking of switching career to web development by means of online, paid courses and possibly a boot camp, but, not having any degree or experience in web development discourages me as I read that it is very hard to find employment as a developer without a CS degree or experience.

What suggestions do you have for careers?

Also, any advice on how to start a career in software development with a non-CS background?

My question is such, how would I best prepare for this exam? Are there any good resources that I could use to brush up on some of these areas? Is this even something I could do in a week? I will still probably take the test regardless so I can know for next time.

25,I've been asked to apply for a position I feel I'm overqualified for.,1556690216,"TL;DR: As an engineer 2, management wants me to apply for an engineer 3 even though I feel I am qualified for the jump to a senior level position.

I've been asked to apply for a Design Engineer 3 position by the hiring manager, my manager, and my manager's manager. I'm currently a Design Engineer 2 for almost 4 years now. I like what I'm doing, however I'm looking into moving up to Design Engineer 4 (basically senior level). Jumps like this are fairly common as there are basically no real differences between responsibilities between a 2 and a 3 (a 3 just goes to some meetings as a delegate for the group or as a replacement for engineer 4/5. HR also assigns a 2 and 3 as the same tier.) This DE 3 position is into an area I'm not too interested in. The pay bump is marginal as well, ave ~3-6%. 

I do feel a bit pressured in applying. My manager has spoken to me about applying and even the hiring manager has had his engineers come talk to me about this. I've told them all that I would think about it. 

And, although having these managers vouch for me is great, I can't help but feel a bit peeved that they do not see me as ready to make the jump to engineer 4. I'm a trusted technical lead in my area, I drive new content and design options, help my team keep our metrics green regardless of area of responsibilities, mentor new employees and interns, all the while doing some leadership extracurricular activities. This was evident in my last year review as my performance was within the top 10% in my engineering group as a whole. I also interviewed for a engineer 4 in another group and only lost to the hired engineer because my experience was just a bit lower than his. This was last spring. There's even been an opening for an engineer 4 within the group that they haven't spoken to me about. I'm leaning towards not applying, but am I losing out on a career opportunity by not applying? Or by applying and possibly getting hired, is it possible to lose out on a position I actually feel would fit my interests more? And if I don't apply, how would I approach the hiring manager in order to not ""burn bridges"" and even let him know I appreciate his recommendation?

California. I’m at the end of my fourth quarter but taking one extra quarter in the fall to finish up, so I’ll be a student until the end of December. I’m not taking the extra quarter due to failed classes, but due to time restrictions (internship, leadership positions in clubs, etc.)

I’ve worked as a land development intern for ten months at a firm. The Vice President called me in the other day and told me he doesn’t think the company will hire me, mainly due to the fact that they hired three fresh-out-of-college engineers last year. He said they’re looking for someone with some more experience. I have a good relationship with my bosses, and it’s a great internship that I’ve learned a lot at. 

That being said, he thought this was my last quarter, and held off telling me this until I potentially would’ve been 5 weeks away from graduation. He said I can stay on as an intern until December.

That being said, would it be better to find another company to work for?

44,How can I avoid being ghosted during code reviews?,1556649618,"I don't know if there's a software engineering subreddit, but, here goes nothing.

I often work with extremely complex legacy code that doesn't follow any known design patterns - code is rarely documented, readable, or tested before it's released to production. There's no culture of knowledge sharing, testing, teamwork, or collaboration.

My code has to be reviewed and approved by 3-5 people before it can be released production, but, I have no idea how to get people to review my code. For the most part, code is reviewed by the managers of each time, but I can't figure out how to generate interest around my pull requests.

Usually, it'll take 3-5 days to get a review from one or two people, and then it may take days to weeks to receive reviews from everyone else. Since there is a 3 day wide window available for getting code reviewed, and we don't have fixed code cut-off dates, it can be difficult to get code reviewed on time.

If I fail to get 3-5 approvals on my code, it looks bad on me, and I'm penalized for failing to meet expectations. Ironically, I'm typically penalized by the people who won't review the code in the first place.

What are some tips and tricks for getting complex legacy code changes reviewed? 

Here's what I've tried:
- Discussing the architecture of my changes in advance within 2-3 meetings;
- Scheduling 1-3 synchronous code reviews for complex changes;
- Asking people to review my code every day for days to weeks;
- Documenting my code; and
- Writing unit tests.

I'm not allowed to:
- Directly communicate with certain reviewers, since that's another team member's responsibility.

I'll usually receive little to no feedback from anyone but my manager who will typically tell me that he's disappointed, or another reviewer will typically suggest that the code is the worst thing that he's ever seen, and request code changes an hour or two before the deadline.

1. Put a chamber between the air pump and nozzle.

2. Put a rubber bladder between the pump and nozzle to absorb the pulses. Maybe incorporate it into the above chamber.

I'm currently 4 months into my first engineering role at a public utility. I interned here and was offered a full time position upon graduation.  The job is great as it's exactly the work I want to be doing. Pay is a little below average but benefits are fantastic and it's very low stress. This is the type of place that people stay 30 years once they're in.

Their hiring process here takes a while, so I was offered a temporary contract position which I accepted.  When I was brought on I was told it would only be a few weeks to transition to a permenant position, but you guessed it... sudden hiring freeze.  So they can renew my contract when it's up in 2 months, but I have no eta on getting in permenant. 

The problem is while I'm on contract I receive no benefits. 
It's a payroll position but I get no insurance, vacation, or retirement match.  Also there is a stipulation that contact workers must not work for 30 days between contacts, so I'm looking at being laid off for a month.  It all adds up to being a pretty sizable amount of total compensation I'm losing out on. 

I do believe that I'll eventually get hired permenant (it's public works so it's not going anywhere, and my supervisor is happy with my work), and I'm doing ok financially with the job's pay rate.

I just started working (~ 1 month) in a bio material startup. We are a team of four engineers lead by a CEO in her 40s. Everyone including our CEO (engineering background) are incredibly talented, motivated and driven. The company is 3 years old  and mostly funded by government grants and the whole operation runs using ~ 1M USD.

The good stuff:
Since the company is a startup, I am given a lot of responsibilities. I get to work on some really cool projects and the people are incredibly talented. There's is good chance that the company could be acquired or experience rapid growth in 2 or 3 years. 

The bad stuff :
Since we are are startup, hours are LONG! I'm talking 12 hours per day, plus weekends on some weeks. I really have no time so anything besides work, come eat and sleep. Although I really like what I do, this job or field was definitely not my first choice. I cannot seem myself in the same job 5 years down the road.

72,How to Make Myself More Marketable,1556587275,"Hello Engineers,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a master's student studying material science and engineering. I've found that I prefer building and designing things as opposed to the science aspect of the work, so I want to focus in engineering. My thesis is in solid-state batteries and energy generation and storage. I was essentially given an offer I couldn't refuse (full GRA with reduced tuition), so I worked on that project for the duration of my master's degree. My undergraduate degree was in geoscience, but I couldn't find any job with that because it was a glorified history degree. I ended up working in chemistry as a QC technician, but I also did QC engineering, R&amp;D research, SQL queries, and process engineering as well. I left because I wasn't making enough money to sustain myself, and chose to get my master's degree. I was briefly in a PhD program, but I realized that I was miserable in academia and just wanted to get back to industry.

&amp;#x200B;

My materials education has been mainly focused around thermodynamics, metallurgy, and electrochemistry, as materials is an eclectic conglomeration of many loosely connected fields. I've worked with SEM, XRD, AFM, TMA, TGA, argon environments, and several lesser known battery-related machines. I have a rather good GPA (3.87) \[although I know it doesn't matter that much\], and I've been doing as much sketching as I can through sketchup and now solidworks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm posting this question because I want to know from industry what I possibly could do to make myself more marketable. I often send out my resume and get nothing in response. Maybe I need to create better cover letters, but moreover I want to know what skills engineers look for when they hire other engineers. I know a few people who graduated with the same degree and haven't found luck gaining employment, so I want to gain the necessary skills to aid me in getting a job before I graduate (12/19 or 5/20).

Along with that I had a lot of hands on classes such as welding and manual machining and really love working with my hands.

 The process engineering position requires a minimum of 45 hours and from other engineers in this company I have been told a typical work week is 50-55 hours. Along with that the work seems very stressful with tight deadlines that are sometimes impossible to meet. I've gotten a good look at the job because I was able to shadow someone for an hour after my second panel interview with the company.

**To elaborate:**

I'm a few months away from completing my Bachelor's degree and have been struggling to get even an internship for the past 6 months (working 50/hrs. a week doesn't help). I have a feeling it’s because I'm receiving my degree from a for-profit online university... which, to my understanding, is not really desirable in an employee. Sadly, it’s all I can afford.

Since I've started working in R&amp;D I've thought more and more about going all-in and going for a Master's degree in Embedded Systems Engineering from an on-site university. Although, my research keeps yielding that I wouldn't even be able to afford that if it was acquired in the US.

**Tangent:** I already have a monthly debt/bills \~$4600 with \~$4800 monthly income, maxed out my gov. student loans and would have to put myself into another \~$40k of debt to get a MSc or MEng in the US. I wouldn't be able to make the monthly payments from nearly \~$120k of student loans... Hence why I'm thinking a graduate degree from Germany, it'll cost about half the amount.

I've been looking to get out of the job I'm in for a while (my first full-time job, I've been here almost a year, plus another 8 months total of interning), and have recently decided I want to commit to shifting into software engineering (mainly web development). I'm working as a MechE in manufacturing, so I study and practice web dev stuff after work on weekends. My plan was to do this for about 6 months or so until I could get an entry level job in web dev.

However, recently a recruiter sniffed me out and I ended up getting a job offer for a job in engineering that sounds, in most ways, better than what I have now. My main concern is that I don't want to commit to a new job if I don't intend to stick around there for that long; but, it would afford me the opportunity to study web dev at a more leisurely pace and not try to jump the gun early.

It feels sort of amoral to me to take this other job if I know it won't be a long-term thing for me, but at the same time, it's probably pragmatically the best thing for me in terms of numbers, time, and stress levels.

The main alternative option I'm considering is just staying here until July or August before quitting outright and working part-time or just working solely on getting into web dev as fast as possible.

Hey all,

I'm 26-I just finishes a B.A in management information systems (basically a business degree with a bunch of database concepts/sql work) last December. I currently have a gig as a systems analyst at a IT solutions company I landed the other month. The work is dry, repetitive, mind numbing. This was the best I could find outside of help desk for entry level.

Through college I owned my own company (flipping electronics through pawn shops and repairing such) and made the same plus some on a few hours a week-so I can afford to go back to school and maintain that/leave this job.

I was always into designing weird rube goldbergs, solution solving, understanding how and why tools work/wondering how they could be improved etc. I had looked back several times during my degree and thought I should have gone into engineering (several of my friends are automotive for the big 3 and are doing quite well). I'm good at statistics, mathematics, logical problem solving-so on.

I have a few questions regarding this very broad field-

1. Are some fields more flexible than others? Currently I sit on a few monitors and type up proposals 45 hours a week. I like to travel, do things hands on/move about. I'm a people person (sales from the self employed jazz) and like to work in the field. Having flexibility (to a degree) on projects and schedules would be a huge benefit to me personally. Traveling/consulting/similar aspects would all be great. I'm looking at Civil and Mech currently. 
2. I live in Michigan so automotive pretty much rules the state. The nearest university to me does not offer a CE program but does offer ME/Computer/SE and such. With the kind of variety-how did you go about deciding what the best path for you was? I'm wondering if there's a way to shadow a field or similar while starting the degree and making sure it's something that i'm sticking to (as this didn't work well the first time around)?

3) Any resources to determine the job markets/salary base expected? I'd gladly give up some salary for more flexibility but want to pursue something that is in a market that's not going anywhere anytime soon.

My boss said I ""had more potential than any engineer he had met"".  


Anyway, I wanted to move to the city, and got a job up here that paid me 40% more. A software startup the exact same age and size as my last job. I never applied to them, but they contacted me because they wanted someone in electronics engineering and embedded development for their IoT projects. They said it may involve a bit of tech support while I on-ramp. Seemed reasonable.  


It's been 7 months and my primary task is still tech support with no particular end in sight. Tech support drives me mad, especially because I was already DONE with all that. I was given some embedded software work a month or two ago, but I'm being moved off of it so that I can test GUI's in the afternoons after doing tech support in the morning.  


To explain, tech support here primarily revolves around customers sending in HTML documents that don't render properly, and I have to troubleshoot their HTML.  


I can say it is very draining and not something I can't sustain. I have friends telling me I should stop wasting my time with them and find a new job, and the CEO here reminds me I have plans in the future. But my managers insist on removing as much electronics and development time as possible.

17,Confused about my entry level job,1556549509,"Hi, I recently graduated in December as an electrical engineering and started a new job as a software engineer, which I'm decent at programming and thought any job is better than no job, but as soon as I started I realized it's not about programming at all, it's more software integration and such so I have a couple of questions that I wanted to ask here where I'm more comfortable before I ask those questions here at the job. 

The first thing I noticed is that there's no real training and other than the first few days nobody has tried to help out anymore or even given me anything to do. They always say I'm just supposed to learn the entire first year.

So my questions are, is this common to happen in many companies? Should I just shadow the other guys even tho they don't seem interested in teaching me? Should I speak directly to my manager about all my doubts or should I just keep myself busy going over the few stuff they have shown me. Maybe I am just supposed to go and ask and make it clear I want to learn but I want to hear others opinions on this before I start off on the wrong foot with the workers/managers here.

19,How to deal with ever changing priorities if projects?,1556546545,"I'm a mechanical product engineer, 4 years out of school, 3 years at this company. I work at a company with 3 engineers in our business unit.

I have had ever changing priorities, usually driven by product failures in the field or from salesman wanting a tweak to an existing product to get a sale or a whole new product line. 

The product failures are frustrating because we have absolutely zero quality control. No first in first out, no quality department to check incoming sheet metal parts from our manufacturers to make sure they're to print. 50% of the failures are due to parts being out of spec. Another 40% is installation error. 10% is design error etc. Our customers are farmers in areas in the middle of nowhere. Therefore it's extremely difficult to get accurate information about issues in the field. This also applies to fixes that we make and ship since we usually get no feedback and my coworkers just jokingly say ""no news is good news"" and we move on.

Meanwhile, my boss is not good about putting her foot down with anyone regarding unreasonable requests or just with salesmen shouting about something that is really not as important as the other project usually the one they were shouting about the week before. She is always on the verge of a breakdown and I've seen her get teary eyed out of frustration... 

&amp;nbsp;

My main issue that has been that there is no structure to our priorities. I jump to a different project probably everyday and the old high priority is lost in the void. Because the next day brings a new hot issue. Add to that customer service asking me to look up information for them every 30 minutes. I find that I can't complete any project because it's ever changing, at my boss's request.

Every morning when I get to work and before I leave sometimes, I re-write my project list and re-order the priorities, and shove some of them at the bottom of list to the ""some-day"" pile.

&amp;nbsp;

**My question(s):**

Is this normal for engineering? Do you have suggestions about how to deal with this? My priorities changing is out of my hands and driven by my boss. I'm not one to blame others for issues I'm facing, but it seems like the management here is just awful. I'm actively looking for another job because I feel I've tried my hardest to deal with it.

22,PhD vs Job Offer,1556540901,"I am 21 years old and I am currently studying a MEng Chemical Engineering in the UK. I graduate in June and at the minute have two offers for when I do graduate.

First - PhD in Process Control working funded by a large company and at my home city University where I have studied my undergraduate degree

Second - Graduate engineering role in renewable energies sector (mostly lithium-ion battery technology) at a large research institution that is connected to a University in a different city than my home city. 

I think I would enjoy both positions and both are quite technically challenging and research driven positions. Although the job offer would pay more than the stipend I would receive for my PhD, money for the next few years isn't really my main concern as a graduate engineer and I value job satisfaction and my future career path over the short-term.

My main consideration is the future prospects of the two different industries. To my knowledge, control engineering is kind of ubiquitous and there's also a good chance I will get offered a job after by the company funding the research. On the other hand, the energy industry is obviously going to be extremely dynamic in the next few decades as we (hopefully) make the switch to renewables and it would be a rewarding career path.

My secondary consideration is moving away (about 2 hours) for the graduate job role. Would it be worth moving for this opportunity? I know the likelihood is I will have to move at some point in my career, but at this point I am worried about the risk I am taking by moving to a different part of the country for a job.

26,"How do I source environmentally sustainable plastics? (Particularly LPM polyamides, UK)",1556522818,"I'm currently feeling very disheartened after a lot of research and contacting stockholders at the apparent lack of avaliability of recycled and environmentally sustainable plastics on the market.

We are looking for any plastic that can be used for low pressure overmoulding (Pressure &lt;= 5.5bar, temp &lt;= 250C) that is both reasonably FR, and is highly environmentally sustainable (I.E made partially from recycled feedstock or similar). It does not matter if this material is very expensive.

In part I realise that it takes a somewhat specialist plastic to meet this criteria, but at the same time it doesn't seem to be  \*that\* specialist, but it seems that no one I speak to will even entertain the idea of an 'environmentally sustainable' plastic that isn't a basic PP or PE.

Plastics are not my area of expertise, so it is possible that I'm asking for something impossible, though I was under the impression that the plastics used in LPM are generally some of the easiest to recycle? I also understand that plastics are generally awful for the environment, but sadly it's the only real option for us at the moment so I'm trying to do the best we can.

I like the work, as it is heavily dependent upon problem solving, fighting fires for failing products in the field, and communicating technical solutions to non technical management people. What I don't like about the position is the technical aspect of the job is very boring. The interesting projects here or there normally get assigned to the engineers who have been around longer (this is understandable). I've been in this department for 1 year.

My skills and MS experience would lend well to our technology department (R&amp;D) where there is currently an opening.

I want to get into the energy side of engineering. I'm still unsure what I want to do regarding energy but I know it has to be energy, I want to help people out in the future and I believe I can do that well if I get into the energy industry.

In terms of why it needs to be abroad. Back home in India it would take me alot of time to get the knowledge and guidance I'm looking for, also the quality of work is really low and I don't speak the language very fluently so finding the right people to guide me would be hard unless I know people. Dubai on the other hand is very business oriented, there is no R&amp;D done here, everything comes from outside and is simply assembled here. Plus they do not care about teaching people they only see us as people who can do work for cheap. 

I do not know what to do or where to go but I know I need to go abroad. I feel like the experience I can gain outside will help me learn much faster and I can find good mentors who can pass their knowledge down to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26-I just finishes a B.A in management information systems (basically a business degree with a bunch of database concepts/sql work) last December. I currently have a gig as a systems analyst at a IT solutions company I landed the other month. The work is dry, repetitive, mind numbing. This was the best I could find outside of help desk for entry level. 

Through college I owned my own company (flipping electronics through pawn shops and repairing such) and made the same plus some on a few hours a week-so I can afford to go back to school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was always into legos, solution solving, understanding how and why tools work/wondering how they could be improved etc. I had looked back several times during my degree and thought I should have gone into engineering (several of my friends are automotive for the big 3 and are doing quite well). I'm good at statistics, mathematics, logical problem solving-so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few questions regarding this very broad field-

&amp;#x200B;

1)  Are some fields more flexible than others? Currently I sit on a few monitors and type up proposals 45 hours a week. I like to travel, do things hands on/move about. I'm a people person (sales from the self employed jazz) and like to work in the field. Having flexibility (to a degree) on projects and schedules would be a huge benefit to me personally. 

2) I live in Michigan so automotive pretty much rules the state. The nearest university to me does not offer a CE program but does offer ME/Computer/SE and such. With the kind of variety-how did you go about deciding what the best path for you was? I'm wondering if there's a way to shadow a field or similar while starting the degree and making sure it's something that i'm sticking to (as this didn't work well the first time around)?

&amp;#x200B;

3) Any resources to determine the job markets/salary base expected? I'd gladly give up some salary for more flexibility but want to pursue something that is in a market that's not going anywhere anytime soon.

56,Noise cancelling for windows: mesh-like structure as speaker?,1556469005,"Hi and great weekend to everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been mulling over a question that's been on my mind for a while: Can you use a mesh-like fabric (think mosquito net for windows etc.) as a speaker?

&amp;#x200B;

Background of this question is, as the title gives away, about noise cancellation. The concept as it is in my head would include a bunch of microphones spaced around the frame of an window and a mesh of sorts strapped into the frame. Using such a big surface might come with its own side effects, and maybe the way to go is to use multiple drivers spaced around the frame that leverage the mesh as resonance surface, but nevertheless I believe this might be a solution to noisy areas and related health issues (e.g. close to airports, near busy roads).

He has a mechanical engineering degree and is currently enrolled in an online engineering master's program at UCLA.

He began as a process engineer at a manufacturing facility 3.5 years ago making $67k. He did very well and was promoted to a senior engineer 1.5 years later making $73k. He began taking on more and more responsibilities and was offered a transition to the operations side as a manager for $92k. He took this position over 1 year ago (against my advice that they were underpaying him quite a bit) and now makes barely $100k.

He has 10 direct reports with a total of 80 people and $80 million in production output under his management. The only person above him at the site is the plant director and there are about 250 people total at the site. The plant works 24/7 so he is constantly getting calls and messages. This also requires him to often go in to work before 5am or 10pm and stay for over 12 hours.

He enjoys his job immensely and seems to be very good at what he does. Visiting directors and VP's have praised him for his wealth of knowledge and management style. He has also been able to bring his team out of backlog from prior mismanagement. When there are issues at the site, he is the first person that everyone calls and he is head of the emergency response team. All of this for $100k.

I think my main issue is that I feel the corporation is taking advantage of his dedication to the people at the plant to underpay him. He will not listen to me so I need your help. Should he find a new job? What is a fair salary for his job responsibilities? Is his low wage due to his short amount of total work experience?

72,Engineering Project Ideas for Upperclassmen with No Hands-On Experience,1556406668,"Hey guys, so right now I am finishing up my junior year as an aerospace (astro track) undergrad and I'm not gonna lie, this last year has been brutal academic-wise. I went to a community college and took two semesters off before transferring. After transferring, I began performing pretty poorly and I now have 2.8 gpa. It's entirely possible that my graduation may be pushed back a full year as well due to poor performance and the manner in which the curriculum is set up. This has really been getting to me as I have been fighting tooth and nail to do well, but the results just aren't there.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm pretty self aware of the situation I'm in. By the time I graduate, I know that employers will look at my gpa and if I don't have anything else to highlight on a resume, it's likely to go straight into the trash. Because of this, I would really love to do something hands-on that way I can get some experience and hopefully learn a bunch of new things along the way. 

&amp;#x200B;

While at community college, I didn't have the opportunity to get involved in clubs or anything like that because there were no engineering clubs. Since transferring, I was able to involve myself with a satellite club but as soon as I saw my grades were slipping I quit so I could have more time to focus on that. I was only a member for a short period of time and I honestly didn't really enjoy it. I felt that even though I attended club meetings and stuff, it was still pretty tough to actually get involved. There were so many students who attended that it almost felt like there was just a small 'core' group within this club that would do a majority of the work - thats just my personal observation though. Beginning in the fall I'll have a much less rigorous schedule and I plan on trying out a few more clubs - hopefully I'll find one that I really enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

In the mean time (over the summer) campus tends be pretty dead and all the clubs die down because everyone is away. I did not get an internship this summer and I would really like to spend my spare time working on a personal project. I would like for it to be a healthy challenge but also something that would not be impossible to pull off. I would likely be working on it alone or with a very small group (*maybe* one or two other people). But the problem is, since I have *zero* project experience, I don't even know what would be able to do. I've cold emailed a number of professors at my school and every professor who didn't email back saying ""too busy too help"" just didn't write back at all.

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine is really into rocketry (my dream field) and suggested designing a rocket venturi. This is something that this friend and I would likely do together and he's pretty knowledgable about it, so its definitely something cool sounding that I am interested in doing. But I have a few questions for all of you: did any of you work on a project as an undergraduate that really challenged you and gave you a bunch of enjoyable experience? If so, can you tell me about them? I would really love suggestions!

&amp;#x200B;

Ill get straight to the point. 

**INFO:**

year:Third year (Got two more years to go for a total of 5 years approximately)

gpa:2.75 

major: Civil engineering (environmental option)

experience: no internships, looking for one

resume: available and ready

School: Cal Poly Pomona

&amp;#x200B;

**Current situation:**

Well, I fucked up in school. My gpa is a 2.75. For my third year, both semesters at my engineering school, I have been dealing with a serious personal issue. It really affected my academic performance. As you guys can tell, Summer is approaching and thats the season for internships. Well, I applied to seven companies, and its been more than two weeks, and I haven't heard a response. I am really worried about my job status after school. 

&amp;#x200B;

**MY END GOAL:**

I really just need a job after college thats pays decently so I can be independent. Using this Civil engineering degree, thats my plan. However, Idk if my degree from my school, will help me for anything. Like what are my options for just getting a decent paying job using my degree. 

**BASICALLY:**

I honestly love and want to dedicate my time and effort into music production so i can maybe make it one day; however for now, I need some sort of job using my degree. It really sucks, the shit that happened to me, which affected my schoolwork and academic performance. I had a solid 3.0. and now its a 2.75 and might go down a bit more if Im not careful in this semester. Pls help me guys. I need guidance so I can find my path. My goal isn't to be the best engineer out there. I just need a decent job in terms of the degree that i am getting.

DLRP - 2019


Hardware: Raspberry Pi 3
OS: Ubuntu Mate 16.04, RetroPie V4.4
Languages: Python, Java
Temporary: Berryboot


OPERATING SYSTEMS

Ubuntu Mate 16: Currently striping down the OS to the bare minimum I need. An alternative I've chosen over starting from scratch, (A server or mini.iso), then building up instead. Version 2 will be done using this method, but for the time being I need to learn more about the main components of Ubuntu, and the new kernel recently released in UM 19. I've been using my favorite command for cleaning; “sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove ProgramName*”. This method is fine on a small scale where I'm familiar with what I'm purging, but doesn't help me remove large packages and dormant software. Synaptic is also a good tool to use, but it's limitations are still my ignorance. A comprehensive guide on the steps to take to strip down a distribution to its “barebones” or my essentials would be greatly appreciated.

RetroPie V4.4: More testing is required before community support is necessary.

OpenELEC: Analyzing code and components to determine if integration, into an admittedly crowded system, is even necessary. (The thought or idea is that there would be a specially designed OS to handle the three general tasks of; Gaming, Audio/Video, &amp; Administration)


HARDWARE ISSUES

Power: Will consistently show lightning bolt symbol in top right-hand corner of the screen, indicating it doesn't have enough power and/or USBs are demanding more than the unit can constantly produce.

Boot: Looking for solution to avoid having to keep third party bootloader installed, (Berryboot), in-order to have an OS run from a USB.


GENERAL QUESTIONS

Is there an easy method for overriding or forcing components to update? Either one-by-one or in bulk. I realize that some aren't updated because there could be compatibility issues with the newest version of the software, but I'm not a typical user so problems caused will be documented and repaired. 

Is there a comprehensive guide to programming a Python project start to finish? Maybe a template? I can only conceptualize it to a certain point before it becomes redundant. In other words I need to know where to draw my lines.

For hosting a small website, (single domain), is there open-source python tools or examples to aid? Have no experience with website creation or hosting so would need to be a beginner's guide.

I've worked for my current employer for 7 years now, latest title being Senior Customer Support Engineer and been in this role for 2+ years.

I studied BEngTech Electrical, mainly specialising in the RF and comms domain. 

My current role is essentially a level 2 service desk but due to having no reception desk, we often get non technical calls and calls from unsupported customers. 

With all the tedious tasks that pile up, I no longer get to spend as much time on the in depth stuff that I like to do. 

The in depth stuff (somewhat oversimplified) involves tracking faults on our customers networks. 
A customers network will contain RF equipment (basestations and servers), routers/switches, microwave links, other UFH links and the IP network is very heavily meshed across multiple uncommon devices. 

I've essentially had to learn as I go. 

Although I've received a few awards for achievements on networks by being able to track down and fix issues on devices I've previously never touched before, a lot of the work I do feels like a glorified reception role. 

I've been struggling with this but somewhat managing it okay until the other day when I was asking about a pay increase when I was told that I'm not an engineer. 

Am I wasting my time in this role?
Is there something I can do to improve my current situation?

I've got a cold room under my porch sealed from the rest of my basement by an exterior door.  Air exchange is meant to come from some tubes that go through the foundation to the exterior, with vent caps to stop the ingress of water and critters.

I'd like to improve air exchange by having a fan blow air in/out of the vent, but blowing air through one or more tubes with a fan, but don't know what specs (flow &amp; pressure) I need for flow and pressure.

Based on some other posts I've read, this info may (or may not) be helpful:

* room is 4' x 10' x 9'
* tubes are 3.5"" and 4"" wide, 2' deep
* house is in Minnesota -- cold dry winters and hot humid summers
* house has air conditioning 
* door to the basement has weather trim so not much air leakage
* cold room is just for storage

10,Is Graduate School my only option at this point?,1556305024,"Good Morning everyone, I’m someone who graduated last spring in environmental engineering (I’m 23). And as of today (April 26, 2019) I still haven’t been able to find a job. Since my post from about 8-9 months ago I’ve now applied to over 760+ jobs since graduation and still no luck. I reside in the state of California and I ever since the new year has started, I have now expanded my search to the entire US but I’ve still been unsuccessful. I graduated with a 2.9 GPA with only one internship. In addition, I don’t have any connections from my university or my internship that could help me get a job. I was a nice student but I hated socializing so I burned many bridges that I can no longer amend at this point. For the past 6 months, I’ve been working part-time as a janitor at a hotel for 12$/hr and its barely keeping me afloat. But once my student loan deferment ($30000 in debt) ends, I wont be able to sustain my poverty lifestyle and I will probably have to undergo a default on them. 

So in order to avoid that, I planned on leaving to grad school this fall in order to extend my deferment and to also increase my chances in obtaining a job that I would prefer. I have read many other post saying that you should get experience before grad school because I’ll be in the same position, but what other choice do I have???? I planned on getting a masters in mechanical engineering and specializing in thermal/fluid systems since that was what most of my electives consisted of when I was an undergrad anyway. In addition, I will have gained m research experience during grad school, better network connections, and possibly and internship during the summer, and I was hoping that would help me land a R&amp;D job after grad school. Unfortunetely the major drawback is that I’m going to have to take an additional $30,000 in debt to accomplish this. But I’m becoming so desperate to the point where I don’t care anymore and I just want my life to start. So do you think this is a path forward in my current devastating position in my life? And do you think that I should continue to work at my 12$ job over the summer or find an internship before grad school? I’ve exhausted all of my motivation at this point to continuously keep applying to jobs (EVEN changing my resume constantly) and getting the same results. Its pure insanity at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 2nd year ME student and have been debating about obtaining a graduate degree. Specifically this is to do R&amp;D in automotive and possibly tech fields.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is managing between heavy FSAE commitment and getting grades. My school is pretty industry-oriented with 6 coops during the degree, which results in most focusing on obtaining better coops. Either focus on FSAE and get better coops, which gets you a better job later on OR focus on school, sacrificing the fun and incredibly useful skills. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am definitely not trying to obtain a Master's just to tick a box. I have worked at R&amp;D labs and would love to do develop a project/thesis on vehicle dynamics/controls. FSAE has also been invaluable to me and I owe it pretty much every useful skill.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately my grades have been not stellar (sub 3.0) and although I seem to excel in research environments (colleagues' feedback) there is no guarantee that I will obtain an extremely high GPA. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if anyone has dealt with this issue before or perhaps an employer's perspective in automotive and tech R&amp;D.

I've seen animations where they are in forklifts, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were in light construction equipment (like a bobcat). Apparently when butted together, this is called a hydrostatic transmission: [https://youtu.be/MTeJWE\_Ou0g?t=70](https://youtu.be/MTeJWE_Ou0g?t=70)

I can see these being expensive to manufacture, but when it comes to car transmissions, gears (and pumps, etc) are very expensive also. I'm trying to think of reasons that a hydrostatic transmission would be inappropriate as a CVT in a car, and I can't think of any. If the fluid gets hot, you can just throw a cooler on it, the same way you would with an automatic transmission. Very low inertia, no 'jump' between gears, I've read they're pretty efficient. In theory, you could have the engine operating at peak efficiency (or power, torque, whatever), and just vary the displacement of the pump to speed up or slow down your output shaft.

Is it cost? Weight? Strength of the internals/longevity? Serviceability? I don't know much about this type of pump, but it seems to me that a hydrostatic transmission would be a decent alternative to a CVT. I'd think that reliability is more of a concern for a forklift than it is for a consumer vehicle, which leads me to believe that these don't wear much.

I'm an ME undergrad with no experience other than internships... I've taken apart transmissions and other tight-tolerance assemblies, but have no idea what cost figures or any of the important numbers look like.

31,Exciting undergrad experience? Would you do it differently?,1556260206,"Were you competing in athletics? in a non-engineering frat? Did you lay pipe/throw down the hammer often?

Lots of parties? (must've been in civil/geo, most of the fun geeks in these disciplines)

Other than engineering, what did you get involved in/enjoy in university? 

Personally, I didn't party too much since i'd be working weekends + other things. most of my partying during school was small non-wild house parties. Met some fun bros on internship so most partying took place then

School was usually boring, my attitude was ""everything is a drag"" now that I'm reflecting on it. Likely the depression and low T played a big role.

I would definitely do it differently. Ideally I'd actually try to work actively than passively as if I wanted to be in my life. Would've been effectively managing school and business so i would've had some luxuries too but I didn't.

------------

Some unsolicited advice for the youngins:

1) *Work smart* 

Find old exams, lab guides, assignment solutions. A LOT of stuff is the same, you'd be surprised. You will not be able to learn everything from scrat, understand all the theory, and learn to do questions, and remember it later. You will forget a lot of it all the time. No big deal

Rather, try to actually learn while doing the assignments (whether or not you go to the lecture). Don't just copy the assignments.

Copy the labs for the mast part

2) **Cram in the beginning.** 

Get a good idea of what you will be learning in the course right off the bat. Attempt the exams/assignments in the beginning of the semester as if you're cramming for an exam. You should have solutions already from old exams, assignments etc. If not, google is amazing. I taught myself all of my degree, 90% +

Beginning of the semester you have only free time. 

3) **Treat school like a part time/full time job**

Everyday show up and do some work, make progress. It will put you ahead of 90% of the kids imo. Most people don't do shit (myself included) until the last minute and that's why people say engineering is hard. The concepts need time to sit and for you to ask questions. 

If you do 3-5 questions per class per week, you will absolutely do amazing. 

4) **Join an engineering club**

This will get you good hands on experience which is not only good for jobs, it will actually get you involved. Get involved in your learning and take action. It's sad how many engineers have poor hands on skill. Develop some. Do projects you think are cool


5) **TALK TO GIRLS, FLIRT, DATE.  Get outstide your faculty**

Make friends out of your faculty or don't lose touch with a buddy or two from HS in business/nursing/etc. Mingle with different disciplines wtihin engineering, other faculties, and party. It's a very important skill imo.

A fair chunk of the Engineers often are way introverted. It will skew your perceptions too. Mingling with people outside of engineering will show you how people with other personalities interact too, especially when not burdened with school work. 

6) ** Schedule and start early**

Plan your school work, fun stuff, social life, health. I promise you can do it just don't fall behind. Start early. Rather than reading theory, watch youtube videos on example questions. Watch the youtube where teachers use technology to highlight what the concepts are like animations showing what linear algebra really is.

Join social clubs, like a ski club or intramurals. 

7) **Find an internship**

8) **Enjoy it to the best of your ability.**

Don't be concerned with the dweebs around you if you don't get along. Don't be shy, most people are very open to making friends. people will form their core groups in the first year or so. Try to identify to yourself the kind of people you want to hang out with.

For example, you can chose to find very studious classmates to form a group, lazy af kids, kids involved in clubs you're interested in, and people who like to party. It's not all about classes, you can undertake more than school while developing other skills.

If you're finding it difficult to enjoy anything while in school, please see a mental health specialist. It will only do you good and you will learn how YOU can get out of your own way.

32,How to get back into the engineering field after taking a break to try out a different field?,1556253732,"Hi Engineers of Reddit. I am currently trying to find the best plan of action for me to be employed as an engineer. I took 3 years off of engineering to pursue other interests. I graduated college in May 2016 in Electrical Engineering magna cumme laude. Upon graduating I decided to take a break from engineering to travel, working waiting jobs, here and there.

After a year of this, I was all set to go back to graduate school in the Fall to get my masters. Instead of going this route, I ended up taking a job as a Marketing Director of a non-profit organization. This job afforded me a lot of flexibility with my schedule and the ability to travel domestically and internationally for work trips. It was a truly great experience and taught me a lot. Eventually, circumstances happened beyond my control and the non-profit quit being funded. So position essentially became a volunteer position that has required me to get a part-time waiting job to pay the bill. 

At this point, I am ready to be an engineer. How hireable am I being three years out of practice in engineering? What are some ways (if even possible that I could compete with the current graduates)?

Currently my plan is to get a job as a engineering electronics technician (interview tomorrow) and get hands-on experience to technician work while applying to all kinds of electrical engineering jobs in the meantime. If that doesn’t work out, I may have to go back to graduate school, which I am open to but would maybe like to avoid if possible or at least until I’m with a company that does tuition reimbursement.

35,Super Stuck: Dual Water Drain on Same Plane without Leaving Puddle,1556244975,"Basically, I have a sink that has 2 drain pipes on either side.  Sort of like this:  0\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_0

&amp;#x200B;

In actual use, one of the drain will be blocked off.  The reason why 2 drain was left on either side was for convenience so that direction of piping would not have to be determined beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that, because you can't favor either drain, you have to make the plane perfectly horizontal.  (cause if you have a slant toward the right, and the right drain was ultimately sealed, then you are going to have a huge puddle on the right)

Well, perfect horizontal means that water in the middle is not going anywhere.  Hence, my issue, where I can't figure out a clever way for that configuration to work without leaving water puddle in the middle.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some limitations, because the sink is situated toward the ground, so there's no way to rearrange the drain to be underneath and make a central hole in the sink (like your kitchen sink)

There's no power.  So blowing it toward one way or another is not an option.

37,Adding a mutltiple clock cycled instruction into a pipelined processor?,1556238946,"[Here is what the 32-bit risc architecture looks like](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/bapb28/risc_architecture_question/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) 

This is all being designed in verilog. I'm supposed to add a multiply instruction to the processor, without using the multiply operation (ie A \* B), and also I'm assuming building a huge ass lookup table of all the answers is not an option as well (which would greatly sped up the operation).

So essentialy, the mutliplier keeps adding and shifting into two 32-bit registers while a counter register decrements (31--\&gt;0)

So this will take probably around 60 clock ticks to finish a single multiply operation. The issue is, this is still a pipeline so I'm not sure what I should do with program counter and how I can keep the program in the EX phase of the pipeline while calculating the product.

My idea is building two EX blocks in parallel, the first being the normal one and the second being the multiply EX block.

I already have the normal pipeline finished, so really my issue is figuring out how to implement my new multiply ALU into the always incrementing pipeline. Should I make the PC keep resetting to the mul instruction address? Such that pc increments but then jumps back to the original address? Should I make it so PC stops incrementing?

If anybody has any great resources for multie clocked instructions, that would be helpful. I don't think normal data hazard solutions like data forwarding would help, since thats only an issue with calling for an address that's being written to. However, would I need to implement branch prediction if I were to keep the PC branching back to original mulyiply instruction address?",AskEngineers,False,FruscianteDebutante,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bhg31z/adding_a_mutltiple_clock_cycled_instruction_into/

My boss is one of the guys, but still commands my respect as a superior. Basically, I can't imagine a better work environment or team of people to be with than i am now. 

I've always kept an eye open on LinkedIn for interesting messages from recruiters, and while they tend to just send generic messages that are the same for everyone, one message stood out recently and was very interesting. The guy had clearly looked into my profile in depth and asked for more specifics on certain things I have done in the past and my hobbies. 

This is where I tell you my recent fling with 3D printing as a hobby, and my background in Material Science engineering somehow amalgamated into a job description that is super similar to what I'm already doing. The guy told me he was looking for a candidate to fill a job that is virtually identical to my current job, and that it comes with what would amount to a minimum of a 20% raise, or a maximum of a 58% raise over my current position (excluding all perks). On top of that i took one look at the company and knew i would enjoy the job and content. So i gave the recruiter my number and we talked briefly, he asked for my CV and I sent it about 2 days later.

Now, my dilemma. I've only been in my current job for a year and 8 months, and it's my first job out of university doing engineering work. My boss took a chance hiring me as I am not exactly top of the class material, but I work hard to make that up at the end. I had told him i would do at least 3 years before I'd consider looking for a job. Not to brag either, but i think I'm doing a decnt job where i am, boss man is a hppy camper. 

I also know that my company now, will never match the type of raise the newer job could bring me if it goes through, they can maybe offer 8% per year, max. 

I'm torn between staying and going, on one hand I have stability and friends, on the other, my hobby/passion and money. Can anyone advise if they've been in a similar spot?

&amp;#x200B;

Field of Study and Extra-curricular Choices

* The biggest tip I have for those with questions about whether to do ME/EE/CE/BME, whether to do a masters or just jump right into the workforce: **look at job openings for the companies you think you might want to work for**.  
* First, you'll get exposure to a number of different job descriptions you may not have known existed
* Second, when you find jobs you're interested in at an entry level, it will tell you what the company's ""ideal"" candidate is.  For example, if all of the jobs that require a masters also require 5-8 years of experience, it is probable just having a masters won't get you in the door for that job.

&amp;#x200B;

Job and Salary Evaluation

* [Bureau of Labor Statistics Data by Occupation](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_stru.htm#17-0000)
   * Find your field, and you can dig through the treasure trove of data
   * Look at medians, they skew less than means
* [More Granular Pay and Benefits from BLS](https://www.bls.gov/data/#wages)
* Don't take a job where you feel from the outset that you are underpaid unless you are okay with always being underpaid.  This isn't a teacher or non-profit sub, generally I don't think engineers are in the category of ""everyone is underpaid.""

tensile stress = density \* radius\^2 \* angular velocity\^2

My flywheel is made of steel, has a diameter of 1150mm, length of 600mm and is rotating at 2880 rpm. With the Solidworks simulation I only get a maximum stress of 96 MPa which seems very low to me.

4,How do I calculate molecular weight of saturated steam??,1556142871,"I was looking at a research paper for a steam application and in their theoretical calculations, they have a gas constant variable. 

This variable is denoted as: *R* 

With the following units:  kJkg^(-1)K^(-1)

As we know, the gas constant *R* units is usually mole-based like so: kJmol^(-1)K^(-1)

I realize now that this ""gas constant"" is actually a specific gas constant, i.e. it is specific to the application and you need to have the molecular weight of your gas to calculate it. 

Now how do I go about calculating the molecular weight of steam? I was thinking of using the ideal gas law:

    PV = nRT  ---&gt;  PV = (m/M)RT ---&gt; M = mRT/PV ---&gt; M = ρRT/P

If I use this method I will have all variables here because I know the temperature and pressure, and density is obtained from steam tables. However, I know steam is not an ideal gas.

10,What is the Profile of Engineers hired directly into the automotive or defense industry?,1556137193,"Hello all,


I'm an ME student approaching graduation in December 2019, graduating from a top 50, ABET accredited program. I started off school rough academically, but my GPA has been climbing steadily. I expect to graduate with a GPA of about 3.05, with my upperclassmen GPA being in the 3.4-3.6 range. I've done a one semester independent research study with a professor where I designed and analyzed surface features to assist in the professor's research, and I've had a process engineering co-op (mostly industrial work) with a fortune 500 company. I also just accepted an internship for this coming summer working as an ME intern for an automotive supplier. Other experience I have includes an internship last summer doing non-engineering work (mostly labor) in environmental remediation.


I'm very interested in working in the defense industry right out of college. Companies like General Dynamics (Electric Boat and Iron Works especially), BAE Systems, Lockheed, Rolls Royce, GE Aviation, Pratt &amp; Whitney, etc. are my dream hires. I am also interested in the automotive industry, and plan on applying to the USA big 3 and Tesla as well. I'd prefer to stay closer to home in New England but am absolutely open to moving to just about anywhere (except Florida and Texas). From what I've seen, however, these companies really only accept all-star students with GPAs exceeding 3.5 who've already interred for the companies I mentioned.


So my question is what are my prospects of getting opportunities from these companies? I am trying to prep myself so I know if it is a possibility and I should be picky or if I should take the first opportunity I get. I would love to do design, analysis, and testing work but I don't have any experience doing those in internships (I'm hoping my internship this summer will give me some but I don't know which department I'll be working in yet), and I'm also aware that many entry level positions don't get to do jobs like this, leaving that work to the more senior employees.

24,Placing rainwater infiltration system near house,1556118104,"I'm planning to put a back patio in at my house this summer, and I had been considering using permeable pavers with a couple feet of gravel underneath that I could divert some of my roof runoff into as well.

I'm not finding any specifically local guidance for where I live (New Orleans), but everything I am coming across recommends that infiltration systems have a minimum distance ranging from 5 to 20 ft from building foundations (explicitly even without a basement), but I can't find an explanation. To be clear, I am going to play it safe and *not* jeopardize the foundations of my house, but I'm curious what the specific mechanism is that I'm avoiding. Is it that soil under my house (along the BMP walls) will get washed away over time, either settling in the gravel or going through the overflow? Or is it that an infiltration trench doesn't provide enough lateral support; kinda like why retaining walls are a thing? Or is it something else?

I'm kinda bummed, because one of my big motivations for this project was to potentially help protect my foundation over time, since loss of groundwater is causing subsidence around the city and this would provide some recharge.

50,Got let go after 4 days of work. Thoughts?,1556064662,"This was a design position at a sheet metal manufacturer that does custom work. I have experience in sheet metal manufacturing, however not from a design aspect. I'm good with Solidworks, which is what was used, and how bending and welding works at a conceptual level. I was an associate engineer at a sheet metal plant where I left to pursue other things. Anyway, at the interview the presented a simple problem, a box, had me unfold it and design it. Super simple and easy. I got the job. Then I began doing jobs, all of which are quoted for the approximate time. Some of the parts I hit the time. Some of them not, as (I was not familiar with the process in that time). There were jobs that were sketches, basically drawn from the field, and you had to figure out how to make it, and there were items sent from customers in a stp file and we had to re make it in Solidworks for our shop to do. There were two others there. One used Solidworks, the other used AutoCAD. They paired me with the soldiworks guy and sent me off to do jobs. Not the greatest teacher, and he treated me like an idiot sometimes, as I knew how to do things in soldiworks faster, but I digress... I asked allot of questions about why we do certain things certain ways and how polishing works on stainless, (as I was used to HRPO Steel, not stainless),  how tight certain fittings should be. and how to fill out the mountain of paperwork that came from everything, as we had to put everything together for each department so that they can be completed. Anyway they let me go saying, 

""My skills in Solidworks are good, and I'm a smart kid. But I don't have enough experience. I know how sheet metal works, but I have little design experience and with the pay, they want an experienced sheet metal designer.""

I made 22 an hour. BTW I'm 23, with no degree, I have 2/3 of a ME degree, I'm working my to get experience and pay my way. I knew I was learning and improving quickly, as it's been less than a week. First time I've been let go from anywhere, because I was not a experienced enough. Even with a degree, there was no way I'd be better off doing that job, in my opinion, and 22 an hr is not allot of money. I made some mistakes filling out the paperwork a 2-3 times.

Also packaging all of that all on one chip to further minimize the latency in data transfer, and to not be limited by a ""standard"" like PCI, so they can have their own data bus architecture right?

Would it be possible to place on water a platform of vertically moving but connected individual units of an unstable material that rub against each other (due to movement of the water) thereby creating static electricity, which then somehow could be transferred/collected?   
If static energy was created, would the water basically suck up all the free electrons created? would it make the water charged and therefore dangerous?

I am on the edge whether to keep pursing the dual degree or whether to just switch to mechanical engineering.

With the dual degree I am taking 16-18 credit hours a semester so I can graduate in 4 years (my scholarships will run out after 4 years).  I have good grades but feel overwhelmed, a little stressed out, and I have little time for myself (workout, social activities).  If I were to switch to strictly mechanical engineering, I could put aside more time for myself and my personal health and dedicate more time to a smaller number of classes (12-14 credit hours) and graduate a semester early or potentially pursue a minor.

The problem I face is that ideally after school I would like to work for a defense contractor (Raytheon, Northrup Grumman, Booz Allen Hamilton, etc.) or a commercial aircraft manufacturer (Boeing, Airbus, etc.).  If I drop the aerospace engineering degree and strictly pursue mechanical, how much of a disadvantage would I be at? 

If I were to switch to strictly mechanical engineering, I plan on taking compressible and incompressible aerodynamics, vehicle flight propulsion, and guided missile systems as electives and add them to my resume as “specialty” courses.

Not sure how widespread wave and hydroelectric are in the UK, but I also suspect that their generating ability is higher in April than in the summer.

Question 1: It is my assumption that there are lots of repetitive keyboard actions you have to do in your day-to-day, both with highly specialised engineering software (CAD, fluid modelling, stress analysis) and also when working with reports, spreadsheets and email. 

For example, changing snap sizes in AutoCAD or formatting reports in Word. Is this an accurate assumption or do you generally find no repetitive keyboard actions in your computer work? Specific examples of the tasks and the software it occurs in would be excellent!

Question 2: If the above assumption is true, how do you overcome this repetitive computer work? Do you script your own macros, do you have a USB gadget to automate some of the process or do you use some existing software? Of course, you may do none of these and just get on with it – that’s a perfectly valid answer.

They said to let me know if I get an offer from anyone else or in the off chance that we move and I still don't have a job, to come visit them. Company B called me after and I have had 2 video interviews with them, also went really well. They just offered to fly me over for a day for a final interview. Wife's family is 10 minutes from B so I told them I wouldn't need a hotel or ride from airport. 

So my question is, would it be a good idea for me to tell A, who I like better, that another company is flying me in for an interview and that I could come see them as well if they would like. I won't tell them who is flying me in. The positions are both for controls engineer.",AskEngineers,False,s4turn7991,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bg0e2y/is_it_ok_to_tell_company_a_that_another_company/

40,What parts for a bug-killing laser?,1555909364,"I want to create a laser sentry gun that can burn bugs to death. Like that 2010 mosquito laser by the patent troll company, but it fucks up anything that moves.

I'm a programmer, but not an expert on hardware. I could write custom software or train a neural network to do this, but I don't know how hardware factors in. Precision is not as big a concern as latency. But not requiring mosquito wing detection should make it easier.

It's simple: Wait until small moving blob is detected by camera, computer enables and directs laser until motion stops, then it returns to standby mode. With a thermal camera it could potentially be even more accurate, unless insects wouldn't show up well.

So I think I need:

* An ultra-low latency, high frame rate camera. Preferably a thermal camera, unless that would be ineffective against insects.
* A laser or two.
* Some kind of computer to read the camera data and track things.
* Something to control and physically guide the laser. **(???)**

Would be willing to shell out a few grand for this project if necessary, but the cheaper the better. Just not sure everything I'd need and where to get it, or how it fits together. I would like suggestions for a specific camera, laser, computer, and most importantly how would one guide the laser using the computer.

*I am well aware of the eye safety concerns. If I went through with this then multiple different mechanisms, software and hardware, would be used to ensure absolute safety. It would not be capable of anything when humans are in the same room. I am also aware of the patent, I just don't care, it will stay in my house, and my device would likely be different enough.*",AskEngineers,False,foamandfoil,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bfy79d/what_parts_for_a_bugkilling_laser/

53,Best way to apply for jobs besides applying online?,1555885309,"I currently have a job, but I want to leave this job for personal reasons, so I was looking for advice on effective job hunting. I already have a Github and blog

I've heard people get jobs through referrals, career fairs, networking, etc. I've heard lots of people get offers by only applying to like 20 jobs online. In the past, the only offers I got were from shotgun applying to jobs online. The interviews I got were mostly for small and medium-sized companies, not the large companies I prefer to work at. Shotgun applying was a huge time commitment as I applied to nearly 1000 positions online, so I was hoping I could do better at the other methods

I don't really have any referrals. I didn't make many friends when I was in school and I lost contact with most of the people I knew anyways. I don't know any family who work in the fields I want to work in.

I'm already out of school, and I don't see any other career fairs related to my work that I can attend.

Most of the Meetups I've been to have either focused on speakers giving a presentation or focused on networking. The meetups with speakers giving presentation are more common, but out of the ones I've been to, it seemed like most people already knew someone there as they came with their coworkers, or they don't look approachable. Most of the people I met from Meetup events were focused on networking, but usually these were just one-time encounters and/or the people I met worked in a tech job that's not related to my desired work. Some of them were helpful and offered advice (some even agreed to phone calls to give advice), but that never led to an interview or really helping me with my job search

As for cold-messaging random people or alumni who have jobs I like and work at companies I want to work for on Linkedin, most of them don't reply. Out of the ones who did reply, they just gave generic advice that I've already followed like work on personal projects, build a portfolio, do a bootcamp, attend meetups, etc.

As for contacting alumni whose emails were provided on my school's alumni website, out of the ones who replied, they just gave generic advice on how to job hunt. None of them helped me get an interview. If I wanted to work at their company, they just said to apply online which led nowhere

Am I doing something wrong? Are there other more effective methods I haven't tried yet?

I already use Linkedin. I very occasionally get messages from recruiters.

I've used Solidworks and Ansys extensively for the last 3 years. While I can see that Creo has strengths in analysis and that in comparison it appears to be a light weight program that runs better on older machines. I am, however, seriously questioning the assumption that anyone would actually want to use this program. Modeling parts, even simple parts, is a nightmare.

I have now lost days fighting how Creo wants to do a helical sweep. In drawing the pattern Creo will always assume the incorrect direction for the sweep and prevent the sweep from happening. Worse, it is not possible to actually edit the few models I have, some how, made that the sweep worked once the analysis shows that thread and rod will require dimensional changes. The process of making this simple part is not repeatable in Creo.

In any other program I have used this would be a quick change, the model would rebuild and if there are errors I can fix it. Creo on the other hand, is the worst thing I have ever had the displeasure of working with. Made a mistake, changed your mind, the analysis says that something needs to change... completely start over.

5,Help me understand the forces on a parachute line as the parachute catches a falling object.,1555782864,"  

I’m trying to understand the physics involved when a parachute “catches” the weight of a falling object. Mainly the forces in the line connecting the parachute to the object and how much force is felt by the parachute anchors and in the line.

Background:

Mass = 36.3kg,  free fall = 4s ,  a = 10m/s\^2,   shock cord = 12.2m,  2.5% elongation = 0.3m

I am building a recovery system for a 12ft (3.66m), 80lb (36.3kg) rocket for my university. The system will release a drogue parachute 0-4 seconds after apogee. Then at 1000ft from Earth the drogue will be released, and a main parachute will deploy. 

My questions relate to what is going on when the parachute “catches” the rocket in free fall. 

After 4s seconds of free fall the rocket will have accelerated to about 40m/s and have about 29,000 J of energy. 

(using: v=v0 + at  &amp;  KE = ½ mv\^2)

The drogue should slow us down to about 30m/s; a 10m/s change in velocity or 1815 J of energy.

So where does that energy go? 

The parachute will be attached with 40ft (12.2m) of “shock cord”, every amateur rocket supply website recommends using Kevlar or Nylon webbing for shock cord with tubular Nylon having superior strength and stretch, and Kevlar having superior fire resistance, but they don’t / won’t provide any numbers other then ultimate tensile strength. Digging around I was able to find a table of force vs strain for 1” tubular Nylon webbing and calculated a spring constant (k) at approximately 4000N/m. ( I am very skeptical of this number, it would be really helpful if anyone has real material property numbers for tubular or flat Nylon webbing.)

Assuming a 2.5% elongation (0.3m) in the webbing as it stretches out “catching” the rocket will only absorb about 200 J, a 5% stretch will absorb 700 J. I haven’t found an exact number for maximum elongation but suggestions that it is between 5-10%. (using: PE = 1/2kx\^2)

Does the shock cord need to absorb all that energy when stretching or does it go somewhere else (into the parachute inflating or dispersed over the time it takes to stretch?). Do I even want the shock cord to absorb much energy or will that result in it springing back? I want to calculate what forces the anchor points that attach the shock cord to the rocket are going to experience to make them as small as possible to save weight.

I would also like to be able to run a scaled down test on the webbing and my stitching (using TEX-70 industrial nylon thread) by dropping a smaller amount of mass with a shorter amount of webbing but I’m not sure how to scale things down since the webbing won’t be getting smaller in all dimensions, only length, and I won't be able to get 4 seconds of free fall with shorter webbing (under 6ft or 2m).

Company A Job Title: R&amp;D Design Engineer (2 year rotational development program) 

Company B Job Title: Test Engineer 

Company A offered me the position first and I told Company B about it right before they were about to extend an offer. Company B extends an offer with a salary that is about 8% higher than Company A’s. I explain to Company A that they were my first choice and they counter offer with a salary that doesn’t match B but is about 4% higher than their original offer, so fairly close.

Based off of a R&amp;D/Design internship that I had previously I am fairly confident that this is the career path I’d like to take but Company A’s position will have me rotate around departments (manufacturing, quality, etc..) so I fear maybe I won’t get the design experience I want for those first two years. 

Company B’s test engineer position is primarily quality testing and writing reports. Some testing fixture design here and there but in general I’d be making sure that the product is performing up to a certain specification. Not sure how often people transition from test engineering to design engineering. I’d also be replacing the current test engineers position so I’d be jumping head on into the thick of it all.

Benefits wise they are both very competitive and comparable. Culture in both companies seems great albeit Company B is a much smaller operation but they have a large parent company.

2. I would most likely be looking into being a development engineer for the Air Force (but open to many job prospects. I feel that this is a wide open range with an ME degree) which I have read is good for those wanting to be involved in leadership. 
3. I see it as a fast-track sort of thing. I love the idea of being a leader more than being an engineer. If I love the military, I stay, if I hate it, I come back after 4-6 years and move up quick with new leadership experience.

New to this form and I hope I found the right place or at least someone  who can point me in the right direction. I've scoured the web and have  not found anything that gets me much closer to accomplishing my goal.  I'm  working on a proof of concept for a game I'd like to create.

* You pull back on a lever that rotates a shaft in the opposite direction.  
* The shaft is located about 3 inches above the lever. 
* The lever or shaft has to be spring loaded so when you release the lever the shaft returns to center. 
* Not  knowing too much about gear ratios I suspect all I will need is a 1 to 1  ratio.  The shaft will rotate the same amount as the lever pulled.

58,Job keyword suggestions for Electrical Engineering/Control Theory,1555654427,"Hello,


I am about to graduate with a my masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering. However, I don't fit into the conventional ""electrical engineer"" or ""computer engineer"" at all. I know only the most basic things about circuits and physics and I don't want to work in computer architecture design. I have most of my experience in machine learning but I don't love that subject; I view it more as tools that I can use for other applications.


This year I discovered control theory, and I really love it; I can finally see myself working on advanced topics and enjoying it. I love the direct ""real world"" applications that can come from actually controlling a physical object; one of the reasons I don't love machine learning (in many, not all, applications) is that too much of it is just playing with data without a lot of physical feedback. I am also proficient in coding, and enjoy implementation of algorithms and programming in general.


I would love to find a job that could incorporate control theory, but I am not sure how to go about looking for one. I don't have much physics/mechanical engineering background so I don't know if I am qualified for job postings under those categories, and ""electrical engineer"" postings are almost always about circuits and device physics. 


Currently I am working on a project where I built a small scale car with LIDAR and other sensors and am working to implement a full-scale system that can plan trajectories and move autonomously, and I am enjoying it.


Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get any internships throughout my college career (a massive regret but can't change the past), so I don't know exactly what I like or don't like in regards to an actual job. Also, I feel like it is going to be very hard to get into an exciting or good job.

My Approach:

The moment equilibrium equation shows an intuitive relationship between the masses and their distances from the fulcrum. The equation simplifies to m1 x d1 = m2 x d2. I understand how placing a fixed mass equidistant from the fulcrum as the platform requires an equal mass on the platform to balance it. Likewise, doubling the sliding weights distance would require twice the mass.  As far as I can tell, the balance consists of 1/2 of a [roberval balance](https://imgur.com/bMRQzxb) /4 bar linkage (as shown [here](https://imgur.com/cQSmZlo)) and sliding weights which fit into notches on the right side at regular intervals. 

However, on commercial balances, the weight platform appears to be fixed \~2.5"" from the fulcrum while the mass markings begin much closer to the fulcrum and terminate much sooner than 10x the left sides distance. How can the 1g weight start at a moment arm of \~1.5"" where is apparently contributes 0g, and be shifted out at regular intervals which change its contribution by from \[1-10\]g?

I assume that at equilibrium \[plate unloaded, all masses slid to 0\] the center of mass of the system (including the bar which I neglected) is positioned exactly below the fulcrum. I can't figure out an approach as to how to solve for the masses and spacing necessary to make a triple bar balance work. Can someone give an example of what the sliding masses for the ones, tens, and hundreds of grams could be as well as how the distance scales are related?",AskEngineers,False,HandkerchiefSandwich,/r/AskEngineers/comments/beu97j/reverse_engineering_the_triple_beam_balance/

The three bar balance consists of 1/2 of a [roberval balance](https://imgur.com/bMRQzxb) (4 bar linkage) and sliding weights which fit into notches on the right side at regular intervals. The most basic way to place the notches would be evenly spaced gaps from the fulcrum which are equal to the left sides distance from the fulcrum: sliding a 10g weight to the right of the fulcrum so that it has the same moment arm as the platform requires a 10g mass on the platform, doubling the moment arm requires 20g etc.

2) is the transition back to engineering possible? I’d always worry about straying too far from engineering and becoming irrelevant 10 or so years down the line.

71,Question relating job in Automotive vs Aerospace,1555630065,"Hey guys! I am in a bit of a dilemma right now regarding a summer internship position. I am a second year Mechanical Engineering student student in Northern California. Last semester around November I had been researching and applying to many companies for a summer internship opportunity but I never received any offer. Until these past couple weeks I started receiving phone interviews and offers. 

As of right now I have an offer from Haas Automation (Oxnard CA), Collins Aerospace (Fairfield CA), BMW (South Carolina), and Toyota (Phoenix, Arizona).

In my mind I kinda had decided I was going to go for United Technologies's Collins Aerospace because I thought that doing and internship with them could lead me to another internship/job with Boeing, Lockheed, BAE Systems, or General Dynamics. 

This position with Collins Aerospace, Manufacturing Engineering Operations internship, would be based in Fairfield CA, the pay would be $24.50/hr, and housing wouldn't be included so I would have to look up some place to rent with another intern.

Today, Toyota called me and offered me the Vehicle Performance Development R&amp;D summer internship position, which is based in the middle of the desert close to Phoenix Arizona at their test track. The pay would be $21.15/hr and I would be very close to where my family lives.

Now, the question I have is, what internship should I accept. I know the answer that most of you are gonna tell me is ""Just do whichever internship is going to get you closer to the field that you are trying to go to."" I know I should chose whichever I believe would benefit me the most, but the thing is that I believe both can get me closer to what I want to do. I believe going to Collins Aerospace could maybe get me closer to Lockheed working with jet fighters, and Toyota could maybe get me closer with BAE systems working with military defense vehicles. 

If anyone that knows a little more about the Collins or Toyota could help me or maybe give me a little more info about the companies and career paths, I would really appreciate it.

There doesn't seem to be much reliable information on this topic but from what I've read cobalt, lithium and nickel (all resources used in production of the battery) mining operations pose some significant environmental contamination threats and on top of that the production of the battery itself releases a considerable amount of GHGs which are only displaced after the car has been in use for several years.

I'm talking the inertia that turbines and generators provide to sudden demand changes. If we get increasingly larger proportions of energy from solar for example how do we ensure this inertia is maintained and ensure the frequency is maintained.

  


  


As well as being able to automatically adjust to keep the country on the right frequency, Drax’s massive turbines, spinning at 3,000 rpm, also have [the advantage of adding inertia to the grid](https://www.drax.com/technology/shock-absorbers-keeping-grid-stable/).

Inertia is an object’s natural tendency to keep doing what it is currently doing.

This system inertia of the spinning plant is effectively ‘stored’ energy. This can be used to act as a damper on the whole system to slow down and smooth out sudden changes in system frequency across the network – much like a car’s suspension it helps maintain stability

Although I am close to graduating with the engineering degree, once thing I definitely don't want is to be stuck in an office job. That is the reason I am looking into the option of becoming a Mechanic/ Technician, and yes I know they pay is of course worse and these jobs usually require technical experience rather than a 4 year Engineering Degree, however my goal is to join the industry and later use my Engineering Degree as a possible promotion tool. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a lot of research I have I understand that the Aviation Industry Technical jobs require, FFA Airframe and PowerPlant License. I understand that this license usually requires 1 - 1.5 years of vocational schooling however... This brings me to the questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Are there specific jobs that provide you with the paid training to receive the FFA Airframe and PowerPlant License?**
2. **Are the a military equivalent of the training required to receive  the FFA Airframe and PowerPlant License?**
3. **Is the FFA Airframe and PowerPlant License generally used in the Avionics Industry, or as the license states it is also valuable in the Energy Industry?**

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this is the best sub Reddit to ask this but would really appreciate any advise.

96,"So I launched a startup and made this new social app, an alternative to Instagram - would you be interested in keeping such an app on your phone?",1555591908," 

Hello guys! My name is Eugene. I continuously get pissed by how Instagram shows me old photos of people or things that I don't even think are cool enough to be at the top of my Explore feed. Especially, remember that time when the egg caught the most likes like ever? How crazy is that?

So along with my team, we have made this app called Carusel. Here is the download link: [https://carusel.io/](https://carusel.io/) It is a new social app for content-discovery where the rating and virality of content depend exclusively on its quality, and not on the popularity of the author. For the content consumers, the app helps to find new interests, get unbiased opinions and trending news. For the content creators, the app helps to get the fair recognition they deserve and distribute their content virally.

How Carusel works:

1. A user publishes the post that is sent to a group of random people

2. If they like the post, they might support it

3. A supported post is sent out to another larger group of people, and so on

The more users support the post, the more people it gets shown to. As a result, only the most genuine and interesting content (as judged by the majority of users) receives the deserved recognition and virality.

Unlike traditional social networks, Carusel’s content feed shows users the newly published content from random users all around the world. This way users are not limited to their friends or subscriptions circle which lets them be in charge of evaluating the quality of the content and information. By using this “human filter,” the users create truly high-quality content for themselves! At the same time, the users can choose the tags under which they want to receive content so that they are not being exposed to things they’re not interested in. 

Please, let me know whether you'd use such app? Also, if you think it's a bad idea, why so? Thanks in advance for all your feedback, folks!",AskEngineers,False,Sleap12,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bel6k4/so_i_launched_a_startup_and_made_this_new_social/

99,"Using a stepper motor + lead screw to apply force, would a stepper 5x as strong push 5x as hard?",1555585804,"Hey all, so this is an oddball thing for a project I'm working on, and based on some info I found, basically I way undershot the stepper motor I bought.  


Now, the idea is that I'm using a stepper motor coupled to a 6mm lead screw, with a brass nut, the stepper will be anchored and the nut is what will be applying the force to the target.  


The stepper motor I currently have is 22mm thick and rated for 1000g/cm, at least according to the ebay listing. I used a 4mm flexible coupling (the kind with a spring style cut) to the 6mm lead screw, placed the stepper on a tared scale, and pressed down until it stalled which ended up being at about 13 lbs 10 oz.  


Now, I need several times this amount of force, somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 lbs.  


I am looking at some listings for larger stepper motors, one catching my eye which is 48mm thick and rated at .5 Newton Meters, or roughly 5000g/cm.  


I'm wondering if this sort of thing would scale linearly, and instead of \~13 lbs required to stall the stepper motor, it would be \~65.  


I'd imagine there are some diminishing returns to some extent, and perhaps I'd need t go for a stepper motor that's rated even higher, the highest rated one is about 6600g/cm.  


I just wanted to pass this by you guys and see what you thought, I'm sure some sort of gearing system would be a better way to increase the amount of torque, but it also would add a lot of complexity relative to a shaft coupler, and the extra length of a longer motor is going to be easier to accommodate than the depth that a gear solution would add, not to mention the cost of manufacturing something like that.  


I'm thinking if I am right though, the flexible coupling might have to go out the door in exchange for a solid one, on the larger motors it is a larger shaft, probably about 5.5 or 6mm with a keying flat, and  I could add the same to the lead screw so slipping would hopefully be a non issue.  


Also, from what I can tell the motors are rated in their holding torque, which is also why I don't know if my theory holds any water.",AskEngineers,False,XOIIO,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bek9bf/using_a_stepper_motor_lead_screw_to_apply_force/

I'm trying to make a conveyor belt that will pass along screws in a way so that they will be aligned vertically consistently. To do I've done two things,

* Cut a conveyor belt in half (the long way) and tape it so that it stays together

* Place long, thin blocks along the sides of the belt to create an inward V-curvature so the screw is in the middle and coming exactly straight. An issue that does arise is that the belt will try rise above the blocks So I've taped across the blocks to prevent the belt from rising over the blocks, thus maintaining the v-shape.

The issue I'm having is that the belt has trouble spinning at certain times as it will get stuck due to where I've placed the blocks and top tape guards. So my questions are: How can I fix this to keep the conveyor belt running smoothly or what should I do instead with my conveyor belt to achieve a consistent vertical alignment for the screws I place on it?

AE undergraduate here. I wish to speak with a few working aerospace engineers who can answer a couple of questions about technical writings in their workplaces. (This discussion is open to other disciplines as well).

My understanding is that we use voltage the control the speed of the motor because higher the voltage the more the armature will spin. But does current have no influence? Or is my understanding of this wrong.

Armature spins because the polarity of the magnetic field changes each time commutator brushes touch different lamelle (flake) or they touch both at the same time. But how does voltage or current make the armature spin faster?

I graduated almost a year ago and have been working in retail stacking shelves for minimum wage which is very demeaning. I think I’d be a great asset to a company; I have high potential I think as I’m fairly intelligent and I can communicate clearly as well as being reliable, hardworking and personable. 

I studied aerospace engineering with space technology but I wasn’t massively motivated or career driven through university. I resat test many times over, resat my second year and ended up with a 2:2 bachelor’s degree which left me feeling like I did the bare minimum and as a result I didn’t actually learn much at all from university. Although, I still think it’s a decent accolade to have as there was a lot of work involved in an engineering degree and many people drop out. 

I’m aware that I should have gotten a 2:1, done a summer internship and applied early to jobs before I graduated. This was my intention but due to life getting in the way it didn’t pan out. I have no engineering work experience or qualifications other than my 2:2 degree. I have work experience doing door-to-door sales, good a levels, many years of working part time work in shops.

I’m desperately trying to get a job that is a higher salary than my minimum wage job so I can move out from living with my parents. Ideally I’m looking for a job with career progression that is leveraging my degree. At this point I don’t even mind if its engineering related as I would work in software or any technical job as long as it’s not sales and has a stable 9-5 structure.

I am seeking advice on where to go from here. Currently I am sending out applications for engineering jobs but not receiving anything positive back. Am I employable in Engineering or have I missed the boat? Do I need to work as a volunteer or a temp for experience? Should I get a certificate for some type of programming?

One sign said:

**32""6""** [where "" represents feet and inches]

In order to make the cost less painful, I am thinking about a revenue model that would charge by the number of nets compared.  For example, comparing two 1000 net designs could cost USD 1.00 and comparing two 100 net designs could cost USD 0.10, i.e. USD 1.0 per 1000 nets.

Please help,1555507154,"I have a 1989 Porsche 944 S2 that has an electrical gremlin that causes a clicking of the fan relay. I will try and provide as much information as possible and I would really appreciate your help in being able to work out why it is happening, as well as be able to fix it.

Initially the fan relay used to click randomly whilst the car was in motion.
I have had a look online and suggestions lead to the ThermoFan Switch which sits inside the radiator - more info on this can be found here at the bottom - http://www.clarks-garage.com/shop-manual/cool-01.htm

I replaced the Thermofan switch but this did not solve the problem.

I then replaced the fan relay which changed the random clicking into the clicking that can be heard in this video. The clicking now happens as the revs pass through 2,000 creating the series of clicks as the revs pass up or down through this point. They don’t happen when the car is first turned on, but will start if the car is then turned off and on whilst the engine is warm. https://youtu.be/v30km55uLtE
The clicks also remain whether the thermofan switch is plugged in or not, not sure if this helps.

Using the Clarks Manual link above I have tested the thermofan switch (as per the bottom of the page). I have also tested the fuse box where the relay goes with a jumper cable to confirm this also operates correctly.

The second file in this album - http://imgur.com/a/MHhXcrb - shows the wiring diagram for the circuit but please note that my car does have A/C.

This link seems to have some information on what’s inside the fan relay so again hope this helps too - https://rennlist.com/forums/924-931-944-951-968-forum/162595-inside-the-cooling-fan-relay.html

I am following a tutorial shown on [this website.](http://www.rutherford-robotics.com/balloon/) I have multiple questions regarding making my own balloons.

Is this tutorial complete or is it flawed?

Do I need to mix the talcum powder with the calcium nitrate or in a separate mixture?

Can I make the balloon stronger by dipping over the same mold multiple times after the previous layer vulcanizes?

Is it okay to use a hair dryer instead of an oven to dry the outside layer of latex or would an oven be more safe? (don't have access to a working oven at the moment)

Is it okay to wash the latex after it has dried with hot water or will it damage the balloon?

On the first job I discovered many things about production planning, maintenance planning, spare parts, materials usage, material transformation processes.

On the second job I discovered the world of standards, preserial and serial testing, verification and evaluation of tools. Poka yoke system, lean production, six sigma, preventive and corrective actions. rubber extrusion and vulcanisation.

On the current job I am dealing with automation, sensors, profibus, electrical testing, electrical grid, mechatronics, motor power, LIN communication protocols.

Last summer I had a great internship that I really enjoyed, and I was led to believe by everyone I worked with that I would be welcome back for another (or, 'part time work' if they weren't holding any internship positions). Because of this, I admittedly got lazy for this summer's internship search. I've sent my boss several emails (they were brief, and I don't think I sent him too many), but haven't heard anything. I tried leaving a voicemail too.

So while I did get a late start, I have been online looking for other internships. Haven't heard back, but I did have an interview with a company I liked a couple weeks ago. Great interview, and he seemed happy with it too. He told me 'You'll hear back from us within the next couple of weeks'.

69,Are there ways to make an animation of gas flow in large pipe networks?,1555444637,"I'm an engineer for a natural gas distribution company, and as a result of the [Merrimack Valley gas explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrimack_Valley_gas_explosions) last year, we've been auditing our own low-pressure (LP) systems for safety. We're preparing to make some modifications to some of the regulator stations that serve the LP systems, but there's some friendly debate among our engineering group about which of several options is better. 

Part of this debate might be clarified, in my opinion, if the flow of gas in a distribution system could be visualized since our intuition about how gas flows over time is just that--intuition. For example: a residential LP system covering a square mile has five regulator stations feeding it. One of the stations fails and releases 40 psig into the system. How long until the pressure builds up to over 1 psig at the edges of the system? What does the pressure profile of the pipe within a block of the failed reg station look like? I think a heat map animation of that scenario would be really interesting.

I'm helping a friend design a platform for his 24 ft diameter mongolian yurt. The yurt itself is build by a third party company, and they normally just use precast concrete deckblock to provide support for the 2x6 structure, as you can see on this image: https://imgur.com/a/pVB0HzL

However, my friend plan to use metal post helical pier instead of deck blocks to have a structure that will hold the test of time. We must now find a design that will be able to hold the structure with the smallest amount of posts (to cut cost). We think we have a good design, but we're not sure about a couple of details.

While the yurt is by itself round, we're planning to add a 10' deck just outside the main entrance of the yurt. Thus, we designed the structure so that the girders support both the yurt and the deck.

Here's the picture of our current design: https://imgur.com/a/y5i5a7E Please note that the posts are not to scale on this design.

The girders are made out of 3-2x12 SPF PT wood, is this too much? Could we get by 3-2x10? The joists are 2x8 SPF PT wood, they will overhang by 24"" on each side, and the maximum span is about 7'3"". Could we get by 2x6?

We looked at a lot of different design concerning both the structure and the post location, but couldn't find anything better that we currently have. Do you guys have ideas of a better design?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently working on creating a relatively simple positive air pressure respirator system using readily available off the shelf parts and products, but first a little back story as to why I'm doing this and why its important to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a range of pretty debilitating health conditions that I have lived with for the past 5 years since the age of 18, one of my main symptoms is [Multiple Chemical Sensitivities](http://www.chemicalsensitivityfoundation.org/pdf/What-Is-MCS-by-Ann-McCampbell.pdf) (MCS) which is basically an intolerance of a huge variety of chemicals, both natural and synthetic, that are found all around us in the times we live in. Whilst at times I could describe my MCS as a nuisance, where it really affects me is when I have to do work on my Toyota pickup, which I'm quite fond of. 

I have tried many different half face respirators with no luck, they do help reduce exposure but unfortunately the activated carbon filters are often manufactured with and sometimes impregnated with chemicals that allow them to adsorb non organic compounds that aren't naturally adsorbed by carbon. Before I realized this I actually had a local artisan type chap craft me a [solid wooden face piece](https://imgur.com/a/pZBf7RR) based on the design of a Honeywell respirator I gave him, that I am including a picture of for interest and amusement. It was after combining it with some connectors I had made up and trialing it that I realized that whatever I was sensitive to was inside the filters themselves and not the silicone mask face pieces.

Next I looked into an air fed mask with the full compressor set up, however unfortunately this would involve breathing air that had been dragged through the compressor and then scrubbed by a carbon filter on the other end, which again poses the same problem, plus I would need quite a length of pipe rigging in my garage to allow the air to cool enough for the filter to do its job.

Next I tried the 3M versaflo PAPR system which unfortunately I couldn't tolerate, I believe due to the polyurethane breathing tube and also once again the carbon filter. The good news however was that the headgear itself was pretty tolerable being made of hard cured plastics that don't off gas harmful vapors (maybe a little when new but I couldn't notice any). So I began thinking, why not take a 240v centrifugal blower (UK voltage) and mount that inside an air-box, then run a length of air hose made of the most inert / non toxic material I can find from outside my garage in the fresh air, into the garage and then connect it to the 3M headset via a custom made connector? Seems workable in theory. There are a couple of practical hurdles to overcome, mainly the air hose material (I'll probably start with aluminum ducting plus a small length of flexible hose close to the headset to allow me some limited movement) and secondly, ***What power of centrifugal blower will I need?***

So the [3M M-106 headset](https://imgur.com/a/XyrvJlx) requires an absolute minimum of 170 Litres per minute of airflow to work effectively, but I was advised by 3M to supply 'slightly more' so lets call it 220 litres per minute.

220 litres per minute = 7.76 Cubic Feet per Minute

7.75 cubic feet per minute = 13.6 meters cubed per hour (most centrifugal blower I can find are rated for so many meters cubed per hour).

Now that's all fine but my problem is that I need that 13.6 meters cubed per hour at the headset end of a 12 meter length of 30mm - 40mm  aluminum ducting with what will in reality have only couple of long smooth bends. Is there anyone here that can advise me on the kind of output the fan will need to deliver the required airflow?

Also there is a chance I've just got this all wrong so any suggestions or ideas on how I could improve the design are more than welcome!

7,Question about roof lifting &amp; structural aluminum.,1555380614,"Hello, I want to preface this by saying that I am extremely new to the idea of creating any kind of mechanical or hydraulic system and have had trouble finding answers to some of my questions. I am attempting to build a functional, tow-able pop-up pavilion and would really appreciate help in figuring out how to make this a reality. My rough design is:

[https://imgur.com/a/nfBMCyH](https://imgur.com/a/nfBMCyH)

Wall height: 3.5ft

Roof height (floor to peak): 6ft

Upright height (floor to peak): 8ft

Length: 12ft

Width: 8ft

Currently I was planning to use rectangular 6061 aluminum tubing for the framing. The roof is going to be lightweight corrugated plastic. Side panels are intended to be lightweight plastic siding fastened to the aluminum. I have looked into different lift systems but I'm not sure which can support the required 2 feet lift. I would greatly appreciate help with answers to a few questions or finding resources that I can use to figure out the answers myself. I'm really at a loss when it comes to the actual math I need to be doing in order to ensure safety and integrity.

Questions:

\- Is this idea feasible or doomed to fail?

\- Are the materials I've selected correct?

\- What kind of lift system would be best for this application?

\- What kind of forces do I need to account for when towing the structure?

16,Entry Level Career Development / Transition Question,1555365455,"Hi all,

 &amp;nbsp;

I'm looking for some advice on ways I could steer my ""meh"" career experience 1 year out of college.

 &amp;nbsp;

I graduated in May 2018 from a top 20 US engineering school with a 3.5 GPA in chemical engineering with an engineering management minor, decent internships, and research experience. I took a job as a manufacturing engineer at a large aerospace company in Colorado after graduating, and while the overall industry is interesting, I find my day to day work boring. Most of my days are spent doing paperwork and dealing with minor production hiccups. Things move slowly, and on the rare occasion SHTF in a way that needs serious problem solving, it's usually done via email chains of people speculating back and forth until the issue lands on on a silo'd work group that takes care of it.

 &amp;nbsp;

In short, I miss the analytical problem solving / critical thinking I enjoyed in undergrad, and want to make to transition / develop to something with more satisfying problem solving. Additionally, my salary is not great for the COL in my area which further makes me want to look at things I can do to improve my career.

 &amp;nbsp;

I've thought of the following possibilities and would love feedback on anyone who has been in a similar position or made similar career moves.

 &amp;nbsp;
___
 &amp;nbsp;

##1. Get a MS in Mechanical Engineering
I think that I don't have an involved role at the company partly because I have limited experience, particularly in mechanical design. My company reimburses grad school tuition, I have very good GRE scores, and there are part-time professional MS courses at a nearby college, so this option is attractive.

&amp;nbsp;

##2. Get a MS in Engineering Management or an MBA
I am fine with transitioning to management and not doing hands-on technical work (often cited as reasons engineers shouldn't get these degrees) -- I think the problems posed to management are interesting and varied, and I could see this path being satisfying. I also find the flexibility to other industries appealing since I don't know if I want to be in engineering forever. However, I have heard mixed opinions about how much these degrees actually help someone enter management, especially if done part-time or early in career.

&amp;nbsp;

##3. Look for a new job
Are my complaints a red flag of a bad fit between my personality/company/background and I would be more satisfied elsewhere? I generally like the company and people/culture here and I'd rather not job hop after just a year, it's just that the work I am doing is dry/slow.

&amp;nbsp;

##4. Something else
I've considered getting a degree in something else (e.g. Computer Science) to break into a different industry, but that would likely involve another Bachelor's (or at least several courses from one and a masters) and abandoning a decent amount of relevant work experience.",AskEngineers,False,deersindal,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bdlu52/entry_level_career_development_transition_question/

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway the specific wording is the following:

&gt;Non-Compete  
For good consideration and as an inducement for \[retracted\] to employ  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Employee), the undersigned Employee hereby agrees not to directly

the cause or reason for termination.

consult or be employed in a business substantially similar to, or competitive with, the present business of  
the Corporation or such other business activity in which the Corporation may substantially engage during  
the term of employment.  
This non-compete agreement shall be in full force and effect during employment and for two (2) years  
commencing with the date of employment termination. 

&amp;#x200B;

There do not appear to be any clauses or exceptions to this. There is no definition for 'indirectly compete' either. Is this fine or am I going to get screwed? Would I be able to get any engineering job if I leave to find work elsewhere?

During the detailing portion of it, my detailer's engineer said that the design is insufficient as aluminum loses a significant amount of its yield strength when it is welded. After doing some research, I've found this to be correct. I can't seem to find a straight forward answer as to how much strength is lost though - I now have a range between 20-80%, with a good amount of the results being 40-60%.

The material is 6061-T6 aluminum. His calculation uses a 55% loss, whereas if we use a 45% one we are sufficient. This engineer has made a few mistakes in the past, even one within this calculation, so I'm concerned that while his point is valid (strength loss), the calculation he's using isn't.

The kicker here is that the design is from the IFC set, like I said above. This design is very common and I see it in a lot of projects from a lot of various engineers and architects. I find it curious that no one has raised this as an issue before this engineer.

I am fully burnt out on sales and even with a strong background, positive attitude and friends, I still need some technical experience to get my foot in the door.

I will have a ton of free time to do these courses, plus ASU offers online tutoring, and I have always been strong at math. (with the exception of not studying it for 5 years)

Are there other Unis you know about that might be better or online certificates that might be as useful if trying to find any decent employment in one my interest areas?

I have done some programming courses and they are enjoyable, but I couldn't see myself doing it forty hours a week, I need more hands on work. I never paid attention in school, was always folding origami, taking all of my everything apart and putting it back together, drawing, or sleeping.

With all of that being said I don't want to lose out on this opportunity in Japan. It offers the flight over there, housing, and a decent salary, with full benefits. I'll get immersed in a new culture and learn a language as well.

The large disc in the center is a magnet, and the bolts on the ends are meant to allow you to get the magnet off of things, by tightening the bolts.

I am in an introductory structural mechanics class, and we've started talking about beam bending, but I'm a bit frustrated by this, because everything we discuss is in the linear region, and we don't talk about failure. Essentially, I am very interested in determining what the dimensions of the beam-piece should be (I'm going to take off the upright triangle part, so it's truly very close to a standard beam problem) to ensure it won't fail. To do this, I need to know what the ultimate cause of failure is of a beam of this type. I know this situation can be modeled like this: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Farzad_Fariba2/publication/319472467/figure/fig5/AS:535022109196294@1504570619613/a-simply-supported-beam-under-a-point-load-applied-at-its-center.png

My intuition says that the failure will happen due to the tension/compression that happens due to bending. With P applied, the top of the beam as drawn is in compression, and the bottom is in tension. Once the bottom tension goes over the ultimate tensile strength, the beam will snap.

46,How to transit my career.,1555331390,"Hi everyone,

Im a 27 Male with a BA in Mechanical Engineering. I graduated a year and a half ago. I am right now working as a CONTRACT CAD Drafter for this public company. They manufacture specialized copper pipe and fittings for hospitals. I have been on contract for 10 months, and as they are developing a new product line, they promise they will take me in if the product takes off. My guess is they will hire me to be an application engineer. My tasks now are: Drawing parts in Inventor, Working on a brand new flow cal spreadsheet based on a given experimental set of data, testing finished goods, continuous improvement for production. They pay me $25 hourly WITHOUT any benefits. Lately, I have been told by this junior project engineer, who has been with the company for 2 years, that I should expect my new hire salary to be $55k if I actually get hired because even he did not make above $65k atm. Personally, I think that's a little too low.

At this point, I really want to steer my career path to a BETTER COMPENSATING area. I do not mind traveling. I really like to work with calculations, excels, programming, logic, simulation, and designing. Although I do not have much knowledge of any programming language or electrical logic, I am willing to learn. Please give me some advice/options on what I should study and focus on right now in order to successfully transit my career.

47,Help Needed: Screw Jack and Scissor Mechanism problem,1555330838," 

Hello,

I am currently working as an R&amp;D assistant and have been tasked to design a device part of which is shown in the second link below. This scissor mechanism will be driven by a screw jack (see [http://www.screw-jack.com/jtm10-worm-screw-jack.html](http://www.screw-jack.com/jtm10-worm-screw-jack.html) for reference) and will move as shown in this link:

[https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1c2x\_WX5LqKfqzz5KPUp10e2TG-FgGlwAQWxu3fcTpdY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1c2x_WX5LqKfqzz5KPUp10e2TG-FgGlwAQWxu3fcTpdY/edit?usp=sharing)

Explanation of drawing:

There are two walls (Labeled 1 and 2 in the drawing). Wall 1 will be connected to wall 2 via a scissor mechanism which will be used to extend or retract them. Wall 1 will have the jack attached to it and will also be the one sliding (Yes, having the jack one the stationary wall would be simpler, but the overall design won't allow for that). As the jack is spun, the screw will turn making the collar (the orange rectangle) move up or down consequently extending or retracting the scissors.

I have calculated that there is 1250N of friction between the wall that slides and the floor, and assuming that there is no internal friction in the mechanism itself how would I calculate the minimum force that the screw jack would have to output in order to extend and retract the walls? I did a quick google search and found most of the equations or examples were for scissor lifts rather than this design and when I tried to use said equations I ended up with the jack needing around 1500N of force, which did not make sense to me.

Note: once in the extended or retracted state, there will be no forces trying to collapse or extend the mechanism so the jack would not be under any load.",AskEngineers,False,mdelross,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bdfb4w/help_needed_screw_jack_and_scissor_mechanism/

71,Help with AccelStepper library and serial communication.,1555279965," 

Hi everyone. I am working on a project where I am trying to create an automated air hockey goalie. There is a camera above the table that tracks the position of the goalie and the puck and then sends a value of either '0', '1', or '2' to the Arduino to tell the stepper motor to either turn clockwise, turn counter clockwise, or stop. The whole system is put together and even worked, the problem was that with only constant speeds the motor was not able to move the robot goalie fast enough to block the puck. This is when I was told to use the AccelStepper library in order to improve the maximum speed of the motor. This is my first time using it so I am having some trouble. One problem that I am running into is that the stepper.move() function seems to be controlling the speed of the motor. Shoudn't the move() function only tell it how many steps to rotate? But if i write stepper.move(200) the motor never reaches the max speed that I set. Versus if I write stepper.move(10000) it will move very quickly, however 10000 steps is way too many steps per command. I'm guessing that in only 200 steps the motor an't reach the max speed, but if 1s are continuously being sent shouldn't it eventually reach that top speed? The other problem I am running into is when the motor must switch directions, it does not change directions smoothly. So saying the motor is turning CW and must suddenly turn CCW, the motor will seem to stall for several seconds, and then finally change directions. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.

77,Input Wanted on Career Path Options and Questions for Company Owners,1555273574,"Long story ahead about my current career situation. I went into way more detail than I originally planned, but it helped me think about it in the process.

TLDR: I have an amazing job doing prototype design and proposals at a company I love. Last year I designed, built, and managed two projects for a customer and both worked out great. This week I got asked to become one of three top people at their manufacturing company as their operations/maintenance/design guy. I am going to talk with the owners of both companies and discuss the long term plans, but want to get input on specific topics to discuss with them so I don’t miss anything important. Do you have anything that you would ask to the owners in this situation? 

Full Story:
I've been working for two years at a company that work on automation systems and custom machines. I started out as the general design guy who focused on manufacturing due to my background in a machine shop. Recently I've been moving more into preliminary design, prototyping, and meeting with prospective customers that have needs for custom machine applications. The recent work has been busy, but very enjoyable. A lot of the work is directly alongside the owner who does a lot of the quoting and dealing with customers. He really likes me and I see him mentoring me into an upper management position over the next few years. 

The company is fantastic. Only around 50 employees so I know everyone and the culture is exactly what I want. They spend a lot of time when looking for new employees and personality/social fit in the company is a big factor.  I could see myself here for a long time if it stays exciting and the pay scales well. I just received a raise and am very happy with my compensation. My current employer also has a full machine shop, which I can use at will when it doesn’t impact the current projects. There is a monthly lunch with all the employees that are actually fun and everyone looks forward to them. Just overall a great place and really what I was looking for.

During my first year I was asked to go talk with a business across the street about a small mechanical project. They needed a custom punch press designed for their manufacturing business to replace a very old shop built one that was causing problems. I talked with the owner and their maintenance guy and went over what I thought was a good solution. Ended up turning into a T&amp;M job for design and build. Worked with them almost daily and the final product turned out great. They have been super happy with the results and ended up having me do another machine for them that also went smoothly.

This week I was offered to join the owner for lunch and I happily accepted. There was a thought in the back of my mind telling me they would offer me a job. The owner and both his sons were present and explained that the owner would be retiring and passing the business on to his kids. They need someone to replace what he did at the business. His two sons handle sales and the business operations respectively. They need someone to improve their equipment/machines, build in stable processes that aren't heavily operator dependent, train new employees on updated machines, build an improved maintenance plan, etc. Essentially run the shop while the sons run the office side of things. This process is expected to take at least a year while the owner transitions out to retirement and gets me up to speed.

Based on the responsibility, I can see this position paying significantly significantly more than my current one and possibly gaining a stake in the company after a set amount of time in the position. It is definitely something I would be interested in doing and would set me up better to start my own business in the future, which is something I will likely do. I grew up in a family business and it has shaped who I am. 

I am planning to talk with them next week to get more details on what the compensation would be and have them explain in detail what the first year would look like. How much they have in capitol to put towards upgrades, how much longer they plan to stay in their relatively small building, etc.

In addition I am going to talk with the owner of my current company and ask where he sees me going over the next 5 years.

Here is the question - Let's say I have an EV and my goal is the best efficiency and reliability while keeping the weight down as much as possible. The cost is not a concern.
Now - I want the car to have, for whatever reason, an acceleration 0-100 in 2,5s. I don't need any more than that. The battery pack IS capable of supporting the motor to do that. Keeping that in mind, would there be any actual reason to use supercapacitors for acceleration? Like maybe less stress on the batteries, better efficiency...Or would a better move be to just use the weight for more Li-ion batteries?

87,Improving The Perception Of Engineering,1555231867,"In the organisation that I work for, the work of the engineering department is more asset management, systems engineering and integration of COTS equipment into complex safety critical systems, rather than engineering of bespoke equipment. I imagine that it's similar to some types of defence organisations. 

We've recently gone through a bit of a restructure and it's quite evident that other parts of the organisation (primarily the users of the systems) have a very low opinion of engineering. They don't see engineers as professionals ensuring that the systems implemented do what's required for the right price and safely, rather they see engineers as wasting time producing documentation and holding everything up while not delivering.

Given half a chance, the upper levels of management would love to outsource the entirety of engineering, but I'm not sure they really understand what that would actually mean in terms of cost, risk, quality etc.

6,Is it too soon for next steps?,1555185023,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

First the basics: 

&amp;#x200B;

* The country you're from and/or asking about      **USA**
* The industry you're asking about                            **Technology Hardware**
* Your current experience and degree/education level [**M.Sc**](https://M.Sc) **ME + 2.5 yrs experience**
* Your interest in specific industries and applications: **control systems, mechatronics, computers, systems design**

&amp;#x200B;

I've begun to feel quite frustrated at my job. I've been in my current position about 16 months. I have a hands-on role with manufacturing automation at a computer hardware OEM. Initially, I planned on staying \~3 years because I think it's important to have some continuity in my career choices. Though I was hired for a software and systems level automation engineering role, instead I've found myself doing a lot of repetitive maintenance and set up tasks. Much of the time the work I do could easily be done by someone with a high-school diploma, provided they can think a little. The group I work in is somewhat understaffed and I think my relegation to technician / operator type responsibilities is in part a reflection of that. I like to think I have a ""roll up my sleeves"" mentality so I don't mind this type of thing from time to time but I'm afraid I'm falling behind in the engineering labor force and I think other employees are taking advantage of that attitude. It does not seem like the company is that interested in migrating my responsibilities to more complex problems. A final note, the company probably spent \~10-15% of my first years salary, in addition to my wages, training me. I am happy with my current compensation. Holistically however, I am not enthusiastic about my position in the company long term.

The job market around where I live is pretty hot right now (Mountain West). There are a lot of openings for positions that look much more engaging. I have a master's degree in my discipline (ME) and I think my resume shows a strong progression from my B.Sc. , through my first professional role, grad school, and now. I held one other full-time professional position between my BS and my MS, for about 15 months. I'm eligible for the PE in my locale in one year. I am most interested in mechatronics, HW/SW integration, controls software development, and design. Though my past experiences emphasis different things as well.

My inclination is somewhere between

A) finding another job, slowly, and making sure it's a good fit

B) Sticking it out across the 2 year mark

C) Trying to leverage additional training from my current employer to stay relevant beyond their doors. Possibly an online MS in Computer Engineering / EE. I'm concerned this will make it more difficult to leave if I become less happy in my current role.

So I'd welcome your opinions on the following:

1. Is it too soon for me to consider applying to other positions if I think I'll be happier there?
2. Am I falling for the ""grass is always greener"" trap?
3. Am I over / under-appreciating the time and money my employer spent training me? The training was almost entirely how to setup, calibrate, troubleshoot, proprietary company systems so I can't say that it's entirely transferable beyond their doors.
4. Have I overestimated my place in the workforce?

-2.49 GPA
-Senior project was a bit of a flop, I almost did not graduate because of it
-Didn't take the FE exam my senior year when everyone else was (senior project was killing me)

17,How to prepare a composite electrode?,1555170696," 

Hello,

I need to prepare a composite cathode consisting of active material, conductive carbon additive and binder in the ratio X : Y : 1-X-Y and perform electronic conductivity studies on the composite. I understand the electrochemistry and material selection well, but I have not prepared an electrode myself and could really use some guidance. I have read some literature on the topic and I have summarized what I found below. Along with the protocol I found, I am also adding questions that I have on the different steps.

1. Mix the required ratio of active material and carbon binder using a mixing mill or ball mill to homogenize the samples. (How long do I mix them for? Since the carbon binder and active material have different starting particle sizes, what particle size should I target for in the mixture?)
2. Prepare the binder solution by mixing in 5 wt% PVDF in cyclohexane using a magnetic stirrer while the solution is heated to 70 C to facilitate dissolution of the polymer. (Do I need to add a plasticizer to this solution? I know that it can be burnt off in the end, but how would this affect the ratio of active/carbon/binder?)
3. Transfer the binder solution and homogenized active material/carbon binder to a Teflon jar along with 2 Teflon balls. Mill in a Planetary Ball Mill for 4 hours at 60% maximum power followed by 12 hours at 15% maximum power. What dictates the choice of power and time? Is it arbitrary to ensure homogenization or is there a way to calculate the final particle size based on the initial size, milling time and milling power?)
4. Use calibrated slots to spread the slurry onto an appropriate support. (\[RK PrintCoat\]( [https://www.rkprint.com/](https://www.rkprint.com/) ) allow for easy spreading of slurry, but what DIY/hack options do I have if I do not want to buy this equipment? I will be using an aluminum support since I want to do conductivity studies. Is this a good substrate?)
5. Let the slurry air dry. (Is overnight enough?)
6. If a plasticizer is used heat the electrode at 110 C for 16 hours to remove it. (Again, is a plasticizer necessary? If I do not use it, can this heating process be skipped?)
7. Calander the surface to make it smooth. (Since I am passing the prepared electrode under rollers, would this not change the final thickness of the electrode? Can this step be skipped?)

18,How to prepare a composite electrode?,1555170408,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I need to prepare a composite cathode consisting of active material, conductive carbon additive and binder in the ratio X : Y : 1-X-Y and perform electronic conductivity studies on the composite. I understand the electrochemistry and material selection well, but I have not prepared an electrode myself and could really use some guidance. I have read some literature on the topic and I have summarized what I found below. Along with the protocol I found, I am also adding questions that I have on the different steps.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mix the required ratio of active material and carbon binder using a mixing mill or ball mill to homogenize the samples.  (How long do I mix them for? Since the carbon binder and active material have different starting particle sizes, what particle size should I target for in the mixture?)
2. Prepare the binder solution by mixing in 5 wt% PVDF in cyclohexane using a magnetic stirrer while the solution is heated to 70 C to facilitate dissolution of the polymer. (Do I need to add a plasticizer to this solution? I know that it can be burnt off in the end, but how would this affect the ratio of active/carbon/binder?)
3. Transfer the binder solution and homogenized active material/carbon binder to a Teflon jar along with 2 Teflon balls. Mill in a Planetary Ball Mill for 4 hours at 60% maximum power followed by 12 hours at 15% maximum power. What dictates the choice of power and time? Is it arbitrary to ensure homogenization or is there a way to calculate the final particle size based on the initial size, milling time and milling power?)
4. Use calibrated slots to spread the slurry onto an appropriate support. (\[RK PrintCoat\]( [https://www.rkprint.com/](https://www.rkprint.com/) ) allow for easy spreading of slurry, but what DIY/hack options do I have if I do not want to buy this equipment? I will be using an aluminum support since I want to do conductivity studies. Is this a good substrate?)
5. Let the slurry air dry. (Is overnight enough?)
6. If a plasticizer is used heat the electrode at 110 C for 16 hours to remove it. (Again, is a plasticizer necessary? If I do not use it, can this heating process be skipped?)
7. Calander the surface to make it smooth. (Since I am passing the prepared electrode under rollers, would this not change the final thickness of the electrode? Can this step be skipped?)

Any suggestions to improve the protocol and replace tools (ball mill, print coater, etc) with a DIY/hack would be really helpful since this is my first time and I am on a budget.

21,Anywhere I can get some kind of spring-piston-thingy?,1555162465,"Hey everyone,

I'd like to do some supersonic wind tunnel experiments so I can get an idea of the shock wave environment around a Falcon 9 Rocket. This is just for casual curiosity.

I'd therefore like to build a model with fully-actuated landing legs. Currently the best solution for that that I've thought of is to have springs that are compressed when the legs are folded, and the springs want to push the legs out. A piece of twine can be used to hold the tip of the leg to the side of the rocket. The twine would be on a spool driven by a stepper motor inside the rocket. By letting out some twine, the spring-piston-thingy will push the leg out to whatever length I want.

My problem is I'm not sure how to find the thing I'm looking for. On Mcmaster I found some gas pistons which look like they might be close, but those are all too large. I'd like something that would be as small as possible, so I can minimize material on the rocket itself (which will almost certainly end up being 3d printed). The smallest-diameter gas piston is 0.59"", which is too big for me. Do I just need to find a better listing?

I'd probably be looking for something that is roughly 5 inches retracted, and extends out to be around 7-8 inches. Still very early in the design phase, but it seems like that mechanism will end up being the hardest part to get working so that's where I'm starting.

27,Calulating moment to pick a servo motor to move the load,1555129466,"Hi guys,

Just got a few questions regarding servo selection. I am looking at servo options in kg.cm and I'm wondering how I could calculate this loading. To explain the diagram I have 2 servos going through a shaft and connecting rigidly to the arms at the shaded points. One end of the arm will be rotating via the servo and the other will be free to rotate but supported. If each servo moves one arm assuming that there is a mass of each block of 1.2kg and the arms are roughly 20cm. Could I say that I would need a servo by calculating 1.2*20 = 24 kg.cm or would I have to account for the distance between each servo?

Similarly if I use the second configuration with two connections on each side would I be able to apply the same calculation as above but then say that the torque will be 50/50 distributed across each servo?

I'm currently a freshman in college, and I just learned about this engineering degree program my school has. It is more of a broad 4 year plan that allows you to focus more on specific aspects of engineering you find interesting (i.e instead of taking generic mechanical classes, you can take classes more focused on robotics if that's where your interest is). I would eventually graduate with an Engineering B.S. I have a couple questions. I'm really interested in sustainability and  renewable energies (idk if these are reasonable to look forward to working in after school, but those are my interests). 

Since this program allows me to take upper division courses in multiple engineering practices, would it be wise to take some mechanical and some civil? Or should my main focus just be civil along with the geoscience classes I will eventually take. I just want to know what would benefit me more in the long run. 

Also, would graduating with a generic Engineering degree look bad on a resume? One of the required courses we have to take in the program is having our advisers help us make portfolios to present to possible future employers showing them what exactly we did in school.

I’m a design engineer at a sheet metal fab company, and our big project right now is a large automated material selection tower. Basically, we have a tower which has shelves into which steel pallets (which hold metal sheets) are fed by a crane. 

Right now, I’m trying to decide on the GD&amp;T tolerance for perpendicularity of the shelves with respect to the upright frame... These shelves are welded on to the tower frame, and if they are welded off-kilter, then they can be sloped downward too much, and the pallet carrying 800lbs of steel can fall off and kill somebody. So my idea is to calculate the slope at which the pallet will begin to slide, and base my tolerance around that.

Thing is, the pallets are painted and varnished, while the shelves are unfinished angle iron. I know I’m going to need to use friction coefficients, but I’m not sure which coefficient to use, or how to find the “effective” coefficient.

Obviously there are other solutions aside from spending such time on tight GD&amp;T controls, like measuring for levelness after fab and shimming appropriately, but my boss likes us to be very thorough and not “Mickey Mouse” projects.

Long version:
Well, I (M29) am the sole automation engineer in a production plant, handling things from 1 mil CAPEX to fixing a faulty turnstile. No process engineer, so anything process is also on me. My boss promised a promotion to automation manager this October (well, roughly 20% raise and 10%+ for the year after on an already decent pay). However, dealing with daily politics are too toxic for my mental health, and the workload of 60hr week in and out are taking tolls.

I got offers from another medical company for project engineer post, with 10% over my current salary. No fuss politics and strictly technical works. Also, new field, so everything will be interesting again.

I'm currently earning my degree in Biochemistry, I'm about one semester from graduating. In these 4 years I've worked at several research labs and have found out I absolutely hate wet lab research and have no interest in going to grad school for it. Originally I was pre-pharma but after shadowing pharmacologists I've found out I hate it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two friends that are studying CS and Mechanical engineering respectively, and I've swooned over the curriculum for their majors for years now. I really love working with technology, the only reason I really went into Biochem is because my math wasn't strong going into college, and I had always been good at chemistry (was in chemistry club in HS). I like that they are learning a tangible skill where they get to use their creativity to problem solve, which there is very little of in chemistry research.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that I feel like Mech E is harder to get into and is a bit more intimidating to me.

I would like to work helping people, nature, so maybe studying engineering at all was a big mistake?

I was thinking about going abroad to grad school to pursue knowledge of something I would actually like to do, but eventually I would like to return to my hometown, so I should try something that allows me to create a job for myself, since the local offers are not so welcoming to industries aside the ones I listed before. Any advice?

92,What would cause 277vAC to be present on the neutral of a 120vAC device?,1555004777,"I was working alongside some electricians yesterday who were troubleshooting some failed analog input cards for one of our PLC's. What we found in the I/O cabinet was 277vAC on the neutral wire of the (4) wire transmitter. Now I know this device is being powered with 120vAC so the first thing I had suspected was a ground fault on a 480vAC system, my suspicion was reinforced more when we removed power from this device by shutting off the 120vAC breaker for it and still seeing 277vAC on the neutral (even though the device was completely de-energized). 

Running with that idea, we found that one of our HVAC systems had a ground fault on it so we elected to de-energize it and lock it out. Unfortionetly due to operations wanting to get back up and running, they wouldn't allow us back into the equipment where we discovered the 277vAC to take voltage readings and verify if it was gone. Basically, I can't validate if the ground fault was the source of that voltage.

&amp;#x200B;

Running under the assumption the ground fault was the cause: The part I'm confused about is how would a ground fault on a 480vAC HVAC unit cause the neutral of a 120vAC system to go to 277vAC? Both of these pieces of equipment are fed off of a common 13.8/480vAC transformer. I can't validate whether or not the 13.8/480v and the 480/207v transformers are grounded WYE or floating (the drawings suggest they are solidly grounded).

95,Senior Thesis Product Ideas,1555000519,"I will soon have to complete my senior thesis next year. I am on the engineering pathway at my school, so my thesis is product based. Essentially, I have to invent or improve on a current product and create it myself.

As real engineers, what are some issues that you are faced with, or problems you must solve that I, as a student, could fix? What problems do you see that need a solution? Or, what projects/research did you do in school that I could continue?

96,Systems Engineer in Need of Help,1554998407,"Hello,

I was hired a few months ago as a systems engineer for a technology development group in the aircraft industry. It's the first time this group has had a dedicated systems engineer. As such, I am basically starting at ground zero for several projects in terms of documentation, and I need help.

While regulatory documents like ARP 4761 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP4761) offer some guidance, they are difficult to read, and not always applicable for me since we are a technology development group rather than a new product group. 

I've been writing, or will soon be writing:

ConOps
Use Cases
System Requirement Docs
GUI Requirement Docs
Preliminary System Safety Assessments
-FHAs
-FMEAs
-FTAs
-CCAs
System Safety Assessments

While I don't have much trouble wrapping my head around ConOps and Use Cases, I am mostly concerned about PSSAs, FHAs, FMEAS, and requirements documentation.

Are there good, simple-to-understand, examples-included materials that I can find that help me navigate these processes? Any books on Amazon I can order? Any links online?

As I've said, I've found some things, but they tend to be very technical and overly formalized, or expecting inputs in a very streamlined process that my group does not have.. Mostly, I am looking for understanding principals (Like, where does an FHA end and an FMEA begin?) and how to easily implement those principals in to a finished document.

97,Question about seismic retrofitting,1554994065,"&gt;TL;DR: Will seismic retrofitting to my old house do anything for an m9 earthquake in Seattle?

Hi all,

We live in Seattle, which for the last few years has been worried about ""the big one,"" a magnitude 9 earthquake happening at any moment.  My wife and I have started thinking about what we can do to prepare our house, and after getting some quotes from retrofitting companies, we just want to make sure it will even be worth it.

Our house is from 1947, so it has seen its share of quakes, including an m6.8 in 2001 with no known damage to us.  It's a two story house, about 800sq ft per floor with poured concrete foundation and a brick veneer.  The lower half of the house is street level but surrounded by dirt and rock walls that raise our yard off of street level.

The retrofitters suggested using steel plates every 4-6ft to connect the beams to the foundation, and that's about it.  Would that do anything in an m8-m9?

So I'm a computer engineering major working on my senior project. I'm building a pretty large robot but I need to have the LiDAR situated about 30cm above the ground (So not at the top), and I have several layers above the LiDAR layer. So I need to find a way to maintain the complete 360 degrees of vision for the LiDAR, meaning that I would rather not use metal pillars.

As such, I'm looking for a clear plastic which doesn't obstruct the LiDAR's line-of-sight.

99,Frame design and bending moments,1554992188,"Hi all! Thanks for taking the time to read this. I am designing a frame for an ISO shipping container to sit on, that is then secured to a ship. I'm trying to calculate max forces both between the contain and the frame, and them the frame and the ship. The securing feet that lock the container to the frame are positioned differently than from the frame to the ship, and the final position is important, hence why there is this adapting frame. My question is this: how do I model the max forces? Do I assume the frame is fixed and create shear force and bending diagrams, resolving the force vectors in each foot for the container in relational to the frame, and then do another set of calculations and assume both the frame and the container are fixed together and joined with the ship being fixed? Or is there a method for me to do both together? Or, am I approaching this completely incorrectly. The frame will be an I beam that is sized according to the output of this calculation. Calculation will also define the shear forces and define bolt size and number.

Any help with my thinking is appreciated!",AskEngineers,False,bravopsierra,/r/AskEngineers/comments/bc0eai/frame_design_and_bending_moments/
