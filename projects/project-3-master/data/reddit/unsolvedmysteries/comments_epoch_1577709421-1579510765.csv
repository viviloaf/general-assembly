8,How do I achieve the success that I really want?,1579481737,"Hey fellow engineers,

Recently, I was looking at the [2020 salary survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/ek4ki7/the_askengineers_q1_2020_salary_survey/) and I see these really high engineering salaries only after 5-8 years of experience and a BS degree. Specifically, some engineers have salaries of  $150,000 with a $90,000 yearly bonus or something similar.

I understand people advise to not worry about the money and concentrate on doing the work you love. I understand this and I'll make sure that it's work that I like. However, I also want to be as comfortable as possible and provide whatever my family needs in the future. Which includes setting my goals towards a fruitful salary.

I currently am working on my PhD in Electrical Engineering and my research is in the Device/Hardware security of embedded systems, FPGAs and ASICs. I also have experience in the defense industry.

I'm wondering what qualities should I focus on in order to achieve a comfortable salary? Should I stay in the defense sector? Work private or public sector? What career moves will help me achieve that goal? Managing a team? Becoming a contractor? Should I move to multiple companies to build up experience and gain salary?

I appreciate any advice I can get. I really want to nail down how best approach this and make the information available for others to read. I'm a student and have yet to start my career.

11,Is a Phd in engineering necessary/required to work for top tier Semiconductor companies in the US as an engineer?,1579478076,"I am currently a senior undergraduate electrical engineering and physics double major who plans to graduate in May, 2020. During my undergraduate career, I have been decently productive. I have worked on 2 different research groups/projects since my sophomore year with 1 project resulting in a publication where I am noted as second author, both of these projects are focused on semiconductor fab/physics. In addition, I have held an engineering internship at a decently sized semiconductor manufacturer for my entire senior year and the preceding summer. Through my research projects and internship, I feel I have a gained a strong knowledge of semiconductor physics and processing, at least for a student at the undergraduate level. GPA is only a 3.36, I had a rough freshman year, but had a high upward trend. 3.64 since start of sophomore year and 3.73 since start of junior year. 

As my graduation approaches, I am looking to acquire a position at one of the larger semiconductor manufacturing companies (Intel, Samsung, TI...) in yield enhancement/failure analysis/process engineering roles. I would really enjoy to gain experience working in a 300 mm facility, currently working in 200 mm at my internship.  I am noticing for most positions I am interested in, the jobs essentially require a PhD in either chem/electrical engineering, material sciences, or physics. 

Before working at my internship, I had deep interests in pursuing a PhD in either physics or electrical engineering to pursue a research career in microelectronics &amp; photonics. After a difficult decision, I decided that perhaps working in the semiconductor industry and pursuing a masters degree while working would be a more economical decision (student loans are not low). Not to mention, a 3.36 GPA isn't exactly high so I would unfortunately be a rough applicant. 

Now that I am conducting my job search, and noticing many of these high level companies require PhDs, I am nervous that perhaps to acquire these positions an advanced graduate degree is required? Some are in R&amp;D, but also manufacturing engineers require PhD at these companies. At my current employer, this is not the case. Many entry level engineers were hired with a BS and pursued a MS while working, some even pursued online degrees in EE or statistics. 

I guess my question is this, 

What is the best academic route for engineers after completing their BS if their goal is work for a top tier semiconductor company like an Intel, Texas Instruments or even LAM, Applied Materials, ASML...etc?. 

Perhaps there is no ""best route"" but maybe someone can include trends they have seen from working in the industry. Someone at my job suggested I work as a technician at Intel since I don't have a MS, but I feel this is slightly below my skill level.  

I truly do have interests in continuing my research and pursuing a PhD, but I really am confused on how much value it has in the semiconductor industry, which is the field I am attempting to branch into. Not sure if I should stay with my current company for 5 years and gain industry experience (and potentially MS) or spend those 5 years pursing a PhD? Which would open more doors at those top tier companies? Like I said, mainly looking for yield enhancement/failure analysis/process eng. roles. Finances completely aside, I would choose the PhD, I really enjoy doing research for the sake of doing research, but I am asking this on a job outlook perspective. If the PhD will open doors that I otherwise would not have access to with a MS and work experience, than I may reconsider a PhD.

the conclusion that ""you can't not be able to think of a word for
something if you know a lot of words for something.""

mechanical engineering, and as my vocabulary has grown more and more

23,I have some confusion/questions regarding how CAN communication works.,1579464504,"Hey all, so from my understanding, the canbus is composed of two wires: can-h (high) and can-l (low) with two terminating resistors at the end (whose values are matched to the impedance of the wires to ensure that there's no loss of power). There are various nodes connected to these wires.

When these nodes try to transmit data at the same time, there is a collision and so an arbitration process must be observed so that one of the nodes gets priority. This arbitration process works on a bitwise AND operation. 

The canbus can either be in the dominant state (0), or the recessive state (1). Dominant means that the can-h line goes to 3.5 V and the can-l line goes to 1.5 V. Recessive means that both can-h and can-l voltages are close to 2.5 V. 

My confusion arises when I try to envision what is happening in the actual can-h and can-l wires when the arbitration process occurs. Suppose that we have node A and node B, and node A has an arbitration ID of 0100 and node B has an arbitration ID of 0101. From what I have read, both node A and node B start the arbitration process by using their arbitration ID. The two nodes have equal priority until we reach the 4th bit, where node A sends a 0 and node B sends a 1. 

This is where I get confused. Recall that a ""0"" really means that the can-h line is 3.5 V and can-l line is 1.5 V. A ""1"" means both lines are at 2.5 V. So, when node A sends a 0, it is forcing can-h to have 3.5 V and can-l to have 1.5 V. Similarly, node B is forcing the lines to have 2.5 V. So it seems to me that the can-h and can-l lines are at 3.5V/1.5V AND 2.5V at the same time (since node A sends 0 at the same time that node B sends 1). What is the actual voltage of the line when node A transmits a 0 and node B transmits a 1?",AskEngineers,False,DoctorKokktor,/r/AskEngineers/comments/er1h2b/i_have_some_confusionquestions_regarding_how_can/

Recently, however, I've become pretty disenfranchised with my degree and having doubts about my degree choice as a whole; I've always been interested in the space sector and flight mechanics in general, but as I'm getting deeper into my course, I've started to realise I actually enjoy the materials and structures modules vastly more than the aero-oriented modules.

When I first applied for aero, I was also considering mechanical but decided against it mainly because the course was more competitive (also slightly higher entry requirements), and I wasn't so sure about the design side of it. I ended up doing much better in my A-levels than I thought I would, surpassing the requirements for both courses.

I'm seriously considering trying to switch courses now. As someone who doesn't have a whole lot of direction or idea of what area of engineering I want to work in, I don't want to specialise in anything or pigeonhole myself into a certain sector at this point. I've heard mechanical is the more flexible degree and can be tailored to most industries, whereas the opposite \*can\* be true for aero.

53,Using a microcontroller to determine if a path from point A to point B is blocked or not with very low height tolerance,1579393189,"The post title may sound a little confusing so I drew a diagram of the problem I'm trying to solve:

[https://imgur.com/a/fqiSW5E](https://imgur.com/a/fqiSW5E)

So  as you can see, I need to determine if the path from point A to point B  is open or blocked. The main challenge is that I have *very* low height tolerance of only 3mm. Some potential ideas I've had of solving this:

1. Putting  a tiny (\~0.8mm) surface mounted ambient light sensor at point A. At  point B I could put a tiny white surface mounted LED. Then try to  determine if there is a spike of light intensity read from the senor  when the LED is pulsed. If the sensor reads a high spike, that would  mean the path is not blocked. If there isn't a spike, that means an  object is blocking the path and the light. The only thing I don't like  about this solution is that people would be able to see the light pulses  which could be annoying. I would rather use a non visible light  spectrum such as IR or UV to prevent this, but I can't find a IR or UV  sensor that is small enough. Would the ambient light sensor be effected  by a IR/UV led light?
2. The  potential object blocking the path would be some sort of metal. I was  thinking I could make a simple metal detector (similar to [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Arduino-Metal-Detector/))  using a coil. However, this seems very vulnerable to noise. The  inductor coil would wrap around where the potential object would  be--from point A to point B.

What  do you all thing the best solution would be? Whether it's  opinions/refinements of my current solutions or whole new solutions, I'm  open to anything. Hopefully my diagram is  clear enough.

65,"Is it wise to look for a local engineering job, knowing I will move within the year?",1579383750,"Some context: I graduated from a masters program in Aerospace this past December, which is a semester earlier than I initially planned. The lease on my off-campus apartment does not end until September. I am looking for someone to sublet to, but I'd be surprised if I could find someone who could move in before the summer. Breaking the lease and moving out without a new tenant is not an option. So it seems I have a period of around four months, possibly more, where I cannot move to a new location for a job, unless I feel like paying for a second apartment on top of my student loans.

I've been polishing my resume and exploring job postings, but the companies and positions I think would be the best fit for me are not in my area. There are engineering jobs near me, but they are not the type of work I am skilled or interested in, and I believe I have better opportunities if I am willing to move to a different state. I have some money put away, and can afford to live unemployed for a few months, but I definitely need some sort of employment in the near-ish future to afford this apartment without loans from the spring semester.

The upshot of all this is: **Is it worth seeking out an engineering position for a period of less than a year, possibly less than six months? Is it even possible to find a job within that time frame? Or should I find more immediate, temporary employment until I am able to move to a job I am happy with?**

Perhaps this is naive of me, but even assuming I could find gainful employment relatively quickly, I would feel somewhat guilty for taking a position at a company knowing full well that I plan to leave so soon after starting.

I thought about finding something basic that leaves me with time and energy to work on personal projects or teach myself something valuable, but I feel like I'd probably be better served by some sort of real work experience.

The tank and cap cannot be modified in any way, so no holes, no replacing the cap with something else, etc. All we need is a low fuel light. 

Some ideas we came up with:

- measuring capacitance of the tank: this one is a bit iffy because we can't run any wires in or out of the tank and we cant put probes on the inside. We have seen people attach two copper strips to the outside of a plastic tank/container. Would it be possible to do the same, but insulating the two strips from the tank? 

- using a bobber with a magnet to trigger Reed switches/hall sensors: this idea seems the most doable, unfortunately we can only tie the bobber to the bottom. I've already dry tested this idea and the results are good so far. All we need to do is place mutliple sensors to account for the bobber moving around. 

- fuel pressure switch: the last idea is to add a pressure switch with a T right as the fuel line starts. We can possibly measure the pressure as the fuel gets low and then trigger the led. 

- timing the vehicle until it's empty: other teams have suggested this, it's a good idea, but we are looking to expand on the electrical side of the car.

77,Capacitive touch tape. Does something like that exist?,1579372970,"So I got an idea for project. But it requires one part that may not exist (nobody makes it). I am speaking of something like capacitive touch sensing tape.

Technology shouldn't be a problem, because we already have the technology - we do make touchscreens which can work out pretty accurately where have you put your fingers. I'll call them 2D.
You can buy them pretty cheaply but we can't just easily make these touchscreens at home easily (I am certain someone have 100% done this already). Next you can buy capacitive touch buttons very cheaply or you *can* make them at home *easily*. I'll call capacitive buttons 1D.

Now what I want, can be considered touchscreen just without Y axis (touch detection) extremely stretched (form of tape), transparent, bendable (We are making bendable phones with bendable touchscreens so what?), thin and with adhesive on one side of course. That would be something like 1,5D. I think you got the idea.

We could make a hundreds cool projects with this, but unfortunately nothing like this doesn't seem to exist. Also I don't see any easy way to make something like that at home. I could make it on PCB, but that won't be transparent, nor bendable and will be thick. That's not very practical.

83,Can I use a series capacitor reduce or eliminate buzzing from LED drivers being driven by a TRIAC dimmer?,1579365487,"Hello, fellow engineers.  MechE here doing a bathroom renovation, and I've run into an electrical problem that I'm looking for a solution to.

I want to put my bathroom fan on a timer and the bathroom lights on a dimmer, and I want to do it with a single switch.  As far as I can tell, there's only one product on the market like this, and that's the Lutron MA-L3T251.  Unfortunately, it's a TRIAC type dimmer, which cuts off the leading edge of the sine wave, whereas LED drivers prefer ELV type dimmers, which cut off the trailing edge.

Even though this dimmer is specifically recommended for incandescent and halogen lights only, it dims my LED lights fine (with 3 or more LED bulbs in the circuit to surpass the dimmer's minimum load), but my problem is that the LED drivers buzz at all dimming levels.

It seems that LED drivers are just switching power supplies, which suggests they always buzz to some extent under normal operation, but the buzzing in these particular bulbs is inaudible when plugged straight into 120V power, so I know the problem isn't the bulbs per se.

I suspect that the buzzing is a consequence of the leading edge current spikes creating some kind of resonance in the LED driver, so it seems like smoothing the spikes out would reduce or eliminate the buzzing.  If this is the case, then putting a capacitor in series would probably help.  

Lutron actually makes a [capacitor module](https://www.amazon.com/Lutron-LUT-MLC/dp/B01E9F084E/ref=pd_sbs_60_t_1/138-2897455-3855430?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B01E9F084E&amp;pd_rd_r=3560d4d1-6321-497a-be02-c5f508e9ff93&amp;pd_rd_w=J3MIp&amp;pd_rd_wg=5vMdx&amp;pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&amp;pf_rd_r=D68FKGTQH85Z5KTK021B&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=D68FKGTQH85Z5KTK021B), but it's supposed to be installed in parallel with the load, and according to the reviews, it helps with ghosting (i.e. LEDs staying on even when the switch is off) and may help with flickering, but one reviewer specifically said that it did not help the buzzing.

So I have a few questions.

1.  What actually causes the buzzing?
2.  Am I on the right track about a series capacitor helping?

89,"Recent industrial engineering graduate stuck in dead end software test job, need advice on how to find a new job.",1579351834,"Hello all. So I graduated in December 2018 as an industrial engineer with a 3.3 gpa from a decently regarded state school. I did two co-ops in process improvement at a manufacturing plant which went well, I got good experience and got good reviews from my supervisors however the company had a bad fiscal year and as a result they couldn't hire any new employees the year of my graduation. I ended up accepting a position as a software engineer six months after graduating, for a company that produces ERP and logistics software, they promised me the opportunity to learn a lot about the industry, learn programming and consult with clients on how to efficiently apply the software. The reality is that I don't have any opportunity to learn programming or consult with clients, all they let me do is write training, documentation, and test features that programmers implement and I'm learning absolutely nothing.

Its clear the job is dead end and I'm not learning anything so I know I need to move on, but I'm not sure how to do that or what my options are as far as what industry to move into. I spent my entire senior year doing interview prep at my school's career center, getting my resume critiqued by industry professionals and career counselors, and sending out job applications online and attending career fairs but it still took me until six months after graduation to land this position. And I've been here 7 months now and I feel like I've learned absolutely nothing, so I'm scared that I will look like even less of an impressive candidate now because I won't have much to say in interviews regarding the 7 months I've been in this position.

Also, I want to move out of software testing but I'm not sure what my options are. I feel like I haven't learned anything about the industries our software relates to, so I'm not sure how I could transition into them. Also I applied to many manufacturing positions senior year but didn't get any offers despite my previous manufacturing experience, and now I feel like I'm further away from being a good manufacturing candidate because I've been working in a position mostly unrelated to the field now.

Rather than an industry internship I conducted research for a professor in a Neuromuscular Control lab because to me that was much more interesting. Unfortunately we never published anything because he kept changing the experimental protocol (regardless of how good our results were). I even worked for free over the summer because he said that's what it would take, but still, to no avail (or even a thank you, but I digress). 

Since August I have sent out about 500 applications (~5 a day on average) to positions seeking a biomedical engineer or similar positions for which I am either well qualified or overqualified (short of the x number of years of experience most places ironically require). I have only heard back from a total of 7 of them, all do-not-reply automated rejections, except for one phone interview for a Lab Tech position.

I am a first year masters student, currently enrolled in a Telecommunications Engineering program (similar to electronics and computer engineering, I'm not sure if it's called something else in the states).

My university (in Europe) gives me the opportunity to complete my second year at an American university, giving me both a European credential and an American credential. because there is no direct comparison to what I am studying in my European uni, I am able to choose from a few different options in the American university.

Due to the cost of studying and the challenge of a graduate program, I am very seriously interest in the difficulty level of each masters degree.

I am very torn between the choices. I have previously specialized in electronics which i have really enjoyed but I'm interested in making a transition into more software aspects. (Specially because in my home country the job offer is more limited in HW aspects).

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a little bit about each program:

\* Master of Science in Computer Engineering (32 c.h.): there are different specializations inside this master but I would be choosing Software with subjects like: Software Engineering, Operating Systems and Systems Architectures.

\* Master of Information Technology and Management (30 c.h.): this degree is not an engineering (easier?) and there I would choose the specialization of Data Analitics.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure which would offer the most job security, and the program descriptions online are a bit vague. if anyone could offer some insight into learning more about each program / help me decide-- that would be great.

To be brief, I'm only focusing on the manufacturing aspect of the pcb industry, while im the clock.

My company just decided to start pushing more ""process engineering"" responsibilities onto me, which I am fine with it, but at the end of the day I enjoy being an EE more. However, I strongly believe that they really want to make me into a process engineer. Would it benefit me as an EE, to learn such responsibilities?

I'm not too crazy about it, but given that its all 1/4in thick steel and the load per side is only about 4k lbs, seems fine. 

The suggestion from the fab house was that they have a machine that does all their steel tube cutting now and it is capable of putting in boltholes wherever you want, so they suggested that instead of welding this joint up with the bolted connection on either side of the overhead beam, to instead make a plate that bolts all of these tubes together and then also bolts up to the beam. I'm not so sure I like that idea, but maybe I'm just picturing it wrong. Please, I'm still new to rugid machine design and would love some additional feedback. Thx reddit!

31,Is there a physics principle that causes a shaft that is rotating about the long axis to have linear motion in the axial direction?,1579271860," A colleague came and asked me a question that made me scratch my head.

One of our machines has a coupling that has 2 splined shafts coming out each end. The coupling has a spring in it that forces these splined shafts outward to engage spoolers on either side to keep then in sync.

The problem they are having is that as the system speeds up to running RPM (not sure the specific number) one of those splined shafts wants to move in to the center of the coupling and compress that spring. This is a problem, because it results in mis-engagement of the spooler sometimes.

The question is; what physics principle would cause a rotating shaft to move axial at high RPM's?

My thoughts were that it isn't just physics and that there is some wear on the splines that are coausing this, but I am also wondering if there is some phenomenon that causes a linear spring to compress when it rotates about its' long axis.

44,How do you deal with the change in dynamics between college and full time work?,1579250351,"

Hello all,

I’m an engineering graduate who recently got a full time position at an engineering design firm.

I’m having a lot of trouble adjusting because in school, it felt like everyone was a potential friend or relationship that could be formed. The fact that we were students in a common struggle meant every class was fun with people to shoot the shit with and felt like I was part of a community. As a student I could approach someone with the most random topic and become buddies.

At work it’s different because everyone seems to be doing their own thing. I feel like I hardly interact with anyone and only interactions are for work assignments. I don’t really feel welcomed, but at the same time I don’t expect people to walk up to my desk and beg to be my friend. It just feels like nobody would interact with me for anything other than work.

It’s made me feel isolated not having anyone to go to lunch to and sitting with other coworkers who are very quiet/ not interested in socializing.

I’m an extrovert so my ideal job involves occasional shooting the shit with coworkers on the job but it feels like all I’m doing is working. You know, I’d like to work in a place where I could grab drinks and see these people as more than just coworkers.

to start of i am too an engineer, but not in mechanics so i lack some knowledge.  
Electronics is my thing, i have had a dream for about 15 years to own a cnc.   
so last year a bought a mechanical kit after a prototyp was made to test electronics.  
now im nearly done, but i started to thinking a bit. x and y axis are belt driven (see picture)  
but the z axies use ball screw driven.  the electronics works basically on the Principle the stepper motor moves 1.8 deg each step. when setting up you calculate the circumference and divide it so you get a measurement of what what distans is 1,8deg.

what mess up my head is i due to the timing belt and the ball screw has different circumference and there for different travel length for each step(1,8deg).  
so i need to calculate both, so now my stupid question.  
the ball crew is it consider zero gear ration (only measure motor axel)?  
the timing belt im clueless, if chasing max precision were on the timing belt gear shall i measure? 

i could not find a model which im 100% certen apply to my situation on the timing belt.

So i'm studying Network Engineering in Brazil and my course as the name states focuses on communications, in it we study topics of computer networking (such as protocols, routers, switches, graph theory, sercurity etc) and physical part of thing with analog communications, digital communications, antennas and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem that i'm facing comes from the observation that most of my peers tend to go the computer networking aspect of our course and become network administrators, system administrators, programmers, anything related to IT. This preference comes from the fact that most people in my course are not fond with the physical aspects of communications, and dont see a near future in it (at least not in my region).

So i observe that here we are studying several complex topics and most of us get network admins jobs that only require something like a Cisco certification, we are ""throwing away"" most of our knowledge because most of the jobs in my area dont require them, i know only a handfull of people that actually work on projects and designs in signal processing, antennas etc, areas that my course focuses on! And i really want to be one of them, to use my knowledge to be an engineer and make projects, i dont want to become an IT guy after i get out of college (not as primary choice,, but if it's the only option it then i'll accept my fate).

36,When should I realistically be searching for jobs? (Summer graduation in August),1579117690,"BSME come August. I started the job hunting process in early January, applying to big N companies in particular and some smaller firms. Some callbacks but all rejections have been from them finding out mid phone screening that my graduation date is still so far away and they need people sooner than that... literally today at a networking event with a big name industry leader visiting our school, one of the recruiters told me the exact same thing. I have this date on my resume, the cover letter, and even the online profile applications...

I know it's always good to apply as early as possible no-matter what but literally all interested big N employers and much smaller firms are telling me to apply closer to graduation with no specific time-frame in mind. Is 7-8 months really that far out? Should I just focus on capstone for 1-3 more months and side projects/resume polishing before doing another hard-push in applications?

In your opinion, August is an awkward time to graduate I know but what's a good month to start hitting the ground running with applications? Are the Spring career fairs still worth attending if I'm due to graduate all the way in August?

It was in a niche industry I spent over a year doing at my last job [water treatment plants.] The guy is relentless. Right out of the gate extremely specific questions.

For reference, my last jobs have never required a multimeter, so I was rusty at best. I was never in a ""service"" role, with calibrations and installations. He asked me about how to check for loop amperage of instrument wires. I said I haven't done that, but I probably could. He then asked me how to do it. I stumbled through a poor excuse of an answer. He wanted to know the difference ways of checking it, with breaking the connections or keeping it attached, I guess. I shat out something about switching it to the Amps mode, then said that I wasn't sure because I haven't done this before. His face cringed. Turns out the job is heavily based on doing this. He had to go 5 minutes later, so I spoke with HR for maybe 10 minutes before we hung up. I'm just glad I wasn't there in person. Maybe I could've played it off better?

In that space there's the plenum, fire sprinkers, lightning fixtures and various conduits/piping.

61,1500mm Bed frame lifting system on a budget - DIY linear rail?,1579096619,"I'm looking to make something to raise a (UK) King Size bed by about 1200mm, but possibly up to 1500mm.  Ideally in 30s or less, say - though going down quicker is probably more important than going up and double that would probably be fine.

The bed will be against one wall at the head end and the foot end can have either side up to a wall, bu there will be a gap for a 50"" TV on the wall between the two corners at that end.

The bed will rest on brackets when being used, so the lifting system doesn't need to support the full weight (would be fun if it could lift the weight, but overkill.)

I only have about 2100mm of total space, so can't use a linear actuator, which needs double the available space - and telescoping options are petty expensive.

A nice simple solution would be to get four lead screws linear rails with one at each corner - which would mean no need for extra supports or guides.  However typically they're expensive, designed for higher precision rather than lifting.

I still like the idea of a **screw based system**.  I was wondering about maybe getting an existing linear-actuator and adapting it to be a floating nut type, possibly getting a smaller one and replacing the screw.  Then adding a support at the top.  I shouldn't need fancy stepper motors.  Lead screw makes sense for not needing extra locking - though not sure how much faster a ball screw would be.  
Of course I could just go to a completely DIY solution - but thinking basing it on an existing linear actuator might save some hassle.  


Any thoughts?

Otherwise, my '**backup solution**' is to have 4 guides of some kind, possibly very basic.  Then have it lifted with a cable or strap at each corner connected to a central spindle under the bed connected to a motor - either fully DIY, or for around £140 I think I can get a similar mechanism designed for use in garages that would meet the spec that I could adapt.

I want to avoid TOO much weight - in the past I've made a 'draw bridge' style bed which was counterweighted by some weight hanging from a shaft so it could easily be lifted - though gas struts could also be used in a similar way to significantly reduce force needed.  (The bed in this situation is currently set to pivot vertically on the long edge, but needs a strap to be put over covers to do this and still takes up a good bit of space, where I'm trying to get more space.",AskEngineers,False,geeered,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ep2mco/1500mm_bed_frame_lifting_system_on_a_budget_diy/

65,Mechanical engineering student wants to switch disciplines in master's,1579085679," I study Mechanical Engineering/Bachelors at one of the best engineering universities in Germany, if anyone has an idea of what I’m talking about it’s the RWTH. I am a non-EU citizen but i speak very darn well german, mainly because my whole degree is in german (to give you an idea, i passed the DSH with 90% 3 years ago). Recently I have noticed that I have an affinity for subjects related to electrical engineering, informatics and even computer aided design. I am interested in doing a masters in Automation/Mechatronics &amp; Robotics because it is impossible to switch to an Electrical/Masters with a Mechanical/Bachelors. I feel that a masters in Mechanical Engineering or let’s say in other related fields such as Chemical/ Automotive/ Aerospace / Production / Design is too one sided into one discipline which is “core mechanical engineering”. I am afraid that I will get bored again from certain subjects like I am now and start to regret my decision. 

Subjects that I hated the most are: Dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, materials science, some fluid mechanics concepts (like the law of conservation of momentum)

Subjects that I loved learning about are: CAD, basics in electronics for mechatronic systems, control engineering, basics in informatics (Java language: OOP, UML, introduction to AI), linear algebra, multivariable differential equations

I don’t want to regret doing a master’s with “boring subjects” or repeat subjects from my bachelors but in “greater detail”. After my bachelors in mechanical engineering, I want to explore subjects related to other disciplines: I like programming, I even do it as a hobby and try to enhance my knowledge in C++ programming and MATLAB. I enjoy enhancing my skills in CAD too. I am even interested in doing a master’s in management as side studies. It doesn’t matter to me if I don’t get accepted into a management/economics master’s but I would consider applying to it as an additional study program. However, my main master’s degree would be mechatronics/automation.

Even though I want to do something “different”, I don’t want to be at a disadvantage when applying to jobs just because my master’s degree is “too interdisciplinary” or too “broad”. Is a master’s in mechatronics worse than a master’s in one of the core/pure mechanical engineering fields? Are my job opportunities lower than a mechanical engineer who chose to specialise in one field instead of going the interdisciplinary route?

I am interested in moving to TUM too ( the best mechanical engineering university in Bavaria, southern-Germany) and doing my mechatronics masters there. This university is more famous for degrees related to electrical engineering (but It’s also famous for mechanical engineering too) while my university is more into production and design (more into industrial engineering too). Does anyone have an idea/ studied one of these master’s and can tell me what it’s like? I am talking about the Automation Masters at the RWTH and the Mechatronics Master’s at TUM.

The degree is from a prestigious school and will cost me about $15k (employer is paying for the rest), it'll take me three years to complete (I'll be working full-time), and when I graduate I'll be a Sr. Software Engineer with 6-years of experience.

However, most of the managers and directors I've seen don't have a masters degree, but it took them all 15-20 years until they finally hit ""Software Engineering Manager"", before that they were all stuck as a Sr. Software Engineer.

84,Measuring Flatness of a Large Plate,1579054157,"In a previous life, I worked with a company who had a good way of checking 'flatness' of relatively large plates (3 to 4 feet square) before bolting castings to them.

The castings had machined pads that were known to be flat to one another, and were supposed to bolt to a machined surface that was flat within 0.005"" per foot. Because relieving and machining large weldments is expensive, the company I worked for would find the 'high' spot of the plate, and shim up the other mating locations to achieve a 'flat' surface to mount to. 

For the application, this was an entirely appropriate way to save money, and was not a safety or functional concern. 

What's killing me is that I can't remember what they used to measure these weldments, because they needed to be able to sweep a fairly large area to do so. I remember it being a low-tech and simple solution - nothing fancy like a Romer arm, etc.

The typical mag base and DTI woudn't work. A precision straight edge and level might work....but I don't feel like that was it.

90,Career Advice: How to move into general ME with BME degree?,1579047315,"Hey guys.

So I graduated in 2018 with a BS in Biomedical Engineering from a top state school in New York. I originally chose BME over ME because I was pretty set on going to Medical School after graduation, but I also always loved engineering. Plus a few of the classes overlapped with medical school prerequisites, so I said what the hell and just did it.

 I did very well in school (3.9+ GPA, 2nd in my class) since I had to keep my grades high to get into medical school.  However, since graduation I have decided that being a physician isn't for me, and I would like to explore moving into engineering instead. I've been working for the last year and a half as an engineer at medical device companies (1 yr. as a Jr. Engineer, now a couple months as a Project Engineer at another medical device company). Despite my educational background, I still have taken pretty much the same classes as the ME's, just biology focuses (Bio-mechanics, Bio-Fluid Mechanics, BME design, Biomaterials, etc.) I have a pretty strong background in CAD as well for someone with my degree. 

What I really want to do is move toward working for large government contracting companies, like Lockheed, Raytheon, Kaman, Northrop Grumman. 

How can I move forward to accomplish this goal? The job I'm holding now as a Project Engineer is a lot of mechanical engineering design work, but I don't think one of these companies would even pull me in for an interview given my background in BME.

I'm in the middle of my senior capstone project, and it calls for the design of a parts feeder which will orient small laboratory tubes for automated labeling.

Most feeder bowls I'm encountering with web searches use a, electromagnetic diaphragm to induce vibration, along with leaf type springs to provide the return forces. This may be a bit much to bite off so early, and I was curious if an eccentrically weighted motor would work in providing the vibrations for said feeder.

Second, most of these feeder bowls are made from stainless steel, for longevity and reliability I imagine. My question here is: will 3D printing a prototype bowl have any unforeseen consequences vs. using a stainless bowl? I realize it will weigh a lot less than a stainless bowl, meaning if and when we move to stainless it will need to be re-tuned, but will using 3D printed plastic prevent us from designing the bowl, or will it be fine as an early stage material?

9,Career in automotive engineering without a degree,1579026435,"**Hi all, hopefully this post isn’t too long but I’m desperate for advice right now**

I completed two (very depressing) years of my mechanical engineering degree and had to quit due to unforeseen circumstances. My only guardian was very sick when I began college which caused my mental health and grades to suffer and when she died unexpectedly I had to pull out to become financially independent. 

I’m currently employed at a car dealership as a product specialist as I’ve always been extremely attracted to the automotive industry but I feel as though I’m being pulled towards the sales side of the business rather than the manufacturing side. I’ve had many conversations with many people who have told me that engineering might not be right for me because of my less-than-stellar GPA. I’ve thought long and hard and I still feel ME is where I want to be.

The one class I thrived in was my manufacturing processes class and even when I completed the course I spent most of my time in the machine shop working with the lathes and manual/CNC mills. I was probably the most proficient in my class in CAD and CAM software which led me to working on side projects with my professor and made me realize how much I enjoy the design process. 

My current job at the dealership has opened me up to connections to some custom rim companies (think Vossen but smaller scale). I’ve seen their shops and what they do and it would be a dream to land a position. Unfortunately, I’m afraid to even inquire about these jobs in fear of good old fashioned rejection; being told I’m unqualified and having to face another dream getting crushed. At this point I feel stuck with few fates; stay where I am because it’s easy and predictable or use up my limited time and energy to either figure out schooling or get my foot in the door in the field some other unconventional way. 

My question to those in the field: is this kind of job in design attainable with a lack of a degree but a strong background in machine processing and CAD/CAM software assuming I maintain (or hopefully build on) my current skill level?
My question to the rest of you: realistically, where do I go from here? Assuming taking the easy way out of weaseling my way into a job through connections doesn’t go as I planned, is it worth the time and more importantly the money to try and go back to school? Get an associates? I’ve already convinced myself that my poor track record will get me denied to any engineering school so I’m open to any and all suggestions 

***TLDR; fucked up my GPA, didn’t finish ME degree, spent most of college in machine shop becoming proficient with lathes, manual/cnc mills, CAD/CAM software. Work at a dealership and now want to design custom rims without a degree.

36,I don't like what I am doing in my internship. Want to find another position within the company but they will not let me move around.,1578968066," Hey guys, I need some advice. Currently, I am majoring in mechanical engineering and a senior in college and I have two more semesters to go before I graduate. As of right now, I have been at my current company for around a year in a half. The type of work that I am doing is more on the industrial engineering side, which has gotten very boring for me. I imagined that I would be able to move around the company once I get hired, but I do not think that is the case anymore. My plan right now is to try to get a summer internship that is more in my lane (design engineering) so I can get the experience; however, this company that I am at now will definitely hire me when I graduate in December. Should I take the risk and leave that company to go and get experience in what I went to engineering school for? Or stay and hope that although I'll have experience in Quality Engineering, a company will hire me as an entry-level Design Engineer at some point in my career? Also, before you ask, I stayed there for a while because I thought I would be able to move around and I needed to keep a job to pay bills.

47,5th year electrician and interested in a path in electrical engineering.,1578954594,"Good afternoon guys, I have been an electrician for about 5 years now. Residential, commercial, and have been currently running this job I am at right now. I am currently googling, youtubing, and reading old reddit posts. Most of the reddit posts I have found seem to be 1-2 years old, with some even 5+ years old. So I wanted to stop by and get an more updated approach to this field, coming from my current field.

My main few reasons for the career path are;

Health Care - My wife and I both work trades that have a tendency to let you acquire health care yourself. Which is usually extremely expensive for how healthy the two of us are.

A reliable 401k / retirement - I want to work hard, and know that my long days are going to a happy retirement with my wife.

I love being an electrician, but the book smart part of it interests me more.

Physical toll - I am currently very healthy, but I know - and have heard a lot of stories - about people whose knees/back/etc.. get destroyed and are forced to continue to work because they didn't think about a retirement plan.

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said. I work a solid 40 hours per week, and I am salary. I am in a very comfortable job right now that would understand if I were to go to school. My main questions now, are if anyone can relate to this in any way - and if so, what are some tips or expectations you can throw my way.

I tried to look for the projects of the ECE students or Robotics/mechanotronics students but those projects are made more to represent particular technical skill and competence rather than to try to solve some particular problem or introduce certain idea.

The problem I'm trying to get over is a negative downstream pressure, which ultimate torpedos my expansibility factor and gives me a #Num error because you can't take the root of a negative number (P2/P1)^(1/K) where k=1.4.

Equation for E: https://imgur.com/3vpfVEJ

Re is set at 10000, but I will iterate through this later
p(rho - density) is atmospheric air density.

My upstream pressure reads about 85Pa and downstream about -10 to -13Pa.

I'm using two differential transducers which both have their positive leads hooked up to the respective tappings and their negative lead at atmosphere.  I haven't got single input pressure gauges on hand, unfortunately, but the atmospheric pressure should cancel out (tell me if I'm wrong).

The upstream length is about 4 meters long and has a honeycomb flow straightener in it.  The downstream length is about 3 meters long so that the flow and vena-contra can re-develop.

92,"On an internship in Europe ( From Canada), called my boss to ask him about what time he will be back so that I can show him my work. He got pissed and was angry. Did I do something wrong? How should I react when I see him this afternoon?",1578911760,"So long story short, I live in Canada and currently moved to Belgium for an internship at a University. Its a research/development position and I am supervised, for now, by a high ranked professor ( my boss). I started last week, and so it's been less than maybe 6 days. He asked me to do a little research about a certain topic, compile some data, compare the data and show him what I was able to deduct today. I did the work and came to the university, but he was not present and so I decided to call him to ask about when he will be around so that I can show him what he asked me to show him.

That's when I was in some way confronted by him on the phone. That's how the (very short) conversation went by :

Me : Good morning, it's ( my name)
Him : Oh the student from Canada, yes?
Me: I did the little research you asked me to do, but was wondering when you will be available so that we can discuss it.
Him: I'm somewhere doing some oral examinations. To be polite with you, the least I will say is that we shouldn't turn the tables around and have you tell me what to do and when to come. I am the only one that can contact you and tell you when and where to meet me. There are 50 other students/researchers ( interns and phd students), and if they all started to call....
Me : ( feeling really shitty and started stressing out) I'm really sorry I didn't mean to bother you.
Him : yes... you're sorry
Me : I will be on campus all day and wait for you
Him : Okay I should be here this afternoon I dont know when.
Me : thank you so much, again I appologize for bothering you
Him : OK.


So did I do or say something wrong?I literally came to another continent to work on a project and I'm awaiting instructions. So before he sees what I just did, theres basically nothing I can do other than ,for say, read about the topic and do some more extra research. I left my family, bought a ticket, got an apartment PLUS its an unpaid internship. The least I can expect is some work to do to better myself and be a better engineer/engineering student.I'm just confused now...

 I'm really curious because I've done a previous internship in Canada where I live and I would always go to my manager to ask him questions and what not whenever I needed help. Especially if HE asked me to submit to him something IN PERSON. I used to work in a very big automotive company, and my boss managed alot of employees, yet he would always help if I needed. I literally had no intentions of sounding rude or impolite, and I feel like now my current boss has a bad impression of me. I will probably see him this afternoon when he comes back ( IF he comes back) to show him the work. How should I approach him? Should I forget about what just happened or apologize to him?

Like the title states, a close friend of mine has been losing his vision due to Tunnel Vision and is nearly completely blind. He is a very creative and hands-on guy and on top all the new challenges he faces in everyday life, has had almost every creative outlet pulled from him as his vision has digressed over the last 10yrs. I wanted to reach out to the engineering community to hear thoughts, ideas and things you've seen using technology to overcome these challenges. 

He previously worked at a local tech school teaching machining and welding but is now unable to work and confined to home unless someone is available to take him somewhere. His wife works at the public school as a Special Education teacher but she has been battling cancer the last several years. As you can guess, his mind is always developing ways to make things easier for both of them but is unable to follow through with most of the ideas.  This is where I want to help him.

Currently, he uses the app 'Be My Eyes' quite a bit which seems to be extremely helpful with minor daily tasks (which aren't so minor to him). Navigating his computer has not been a major issue because of the keyboard shortcuts within MacOS. He is becoming more and more interested in Arduino and wants make use of it in simple ways throughout his home and shop, especially if he can some way tie them to his Android phone with Google Assistant. He ultimately wants to be able to adapt his 3-axis mill to have digital read-outs and some voice control (while maintaining safety). He is connected with the local Makerspace in our (very) small hometown which he enjoys becasue it feeds that need to be creative. Somethings I want to start helping him with is getting our hands on a smart thermostat and seeing what it would take to train their dog to guide around their yard.

I don't intend this to be a sob story but felt background information of their situation would be helpful. What I'm interested in hearing is things you've seen or think could enable him to live a less frustrating daily life, be independent and potentially contribute back to society like he used to.

Tl;dr: Close friend has nearly lost all his vision and I'd like to hear ideas we can make his life easier and potentially enable him to make some income using his mill.

So back in December I was invited to Raytheon’s Tuscon Hiring event for January 27/28 for an interview which I accepted and booked my tickets. However I was also interviewing with other companies and I wasn’t expecting to hear back from another company and getting an offer from that other company so soon. Unfortunately, they also gave me only 2 weeks to accept their offer, and it was a really good offer in terms of pay, relocation, benefits, and the work I was doing as well as the big name on the resume  so I ended up accepting that due to conflicting deadlines.

But now I have this booked event for Raytheon with tickets and everything which Raytheon pays for I never gave them my payment information. Has anyone else canceled this type of on-site interview before? Will I be assessed any fees for canceling like flight cancelations ect?

58,Question for petroleum engineers/technologists,1578784416,"18 yo first year student here working towards my diploma in petroleum engineering technology. I have a few questions:
1) Decided to go the diploma route instead of degree to get into the work force faster. Wondering if this was the  correct move? (Plan on upgrading papers to engineer once in the field so i can put my “stamp” on things for approval.)
2) How safe is the industry in actuality, I’m aware its up and down but the media portrayal is that it’s dying. Looking for a professional opinion on this one. 
3) What job titles (and responsibilities with the associated title) are there out there. This question in regards to so-to-speak different jobs within the petroleum engineering field.

60,To be or not to be?,1578777799,"I have a bachelors in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and I graduated two years back. After graduation, I started working as an Operations Analyst which I quite liked. I was exposed to development, product management, sales, marketing etc. This job experience was really an eye opener for me as I had only interned and did work studies in engineering departments within metallurgy. I was working more in a business environment than a pure engineering one. Recently I just left a contract job that was in Market Tech - my second job out of college and I feel like I had somewhat of a better understanding of what I want to do but I am not quite sure. 

I feel like once you start working it’s not just about your technical skills anyone and it’s more about your communication skills as well. I am also a bit of a creative being so I like all things arts and writing. 

What I have realized after graduating and working in business and not engineering is that eventually even if I did metallurgy for a while, I would want to switch regardless to something different so I feel like it’s okay that I lucked out in business. But I also feel a bit like sad that I am not even applying my degree anymore and if I did then I would have to move out of state which I don’t want to do. 

I am thinking about going to grad school for an MBA but I have no idea what that means for me or my career. Curious to know whah MBA school is like and if I should go that path or just keep looking for jobs that in analytics.

 a.  All  propulsive  energy  must  come  from  the  gravitational  potential  energy  of  the  mass  of  the  Vehicle. The entire Vehicle must start from an elevated, non-horizontal position on the team’s Ramp. A release  mechanism must be included as part of the ramp to hold the vehicle up in the ready-to-go config until it is triggered. 

b.  Conversion of the Vehicle’s gravitational potential energy is permissible, but any additional sources of kinetic energy must be in their lowest energy state in the ready-to-run configuration. Pre-loaded energy storage devices may be used to operate other Vehicle functions (e.g., braking system) as long as they do not provide kinetic energy to propel the Vehicle.

 c.  The Vehicle’s total mass must not exceed 2 kg.

 d.  Electronic components and electric devices are not permitted. 

e.  An approximately ¼” round wooden dowel must be attached to the front of the Vehicle. When the Vehicle is placed flat on the floor, the dowel must be approximately perpendicular to the floor, extend to within 1.0 cm of the floor, and extend at least 20.0 cm above the floor. The dowel must be easily accessible - no part of the Vehicle, except the wheels, may extend more than 0.5 cm beyond the front of the dowel. The dowel’s front bottom edge will be the Vehicle’s Measurement Point for distance measurements.

f.  The Vehicle and the Ramp, together, in the ready-to-run configuration, must fit within a rectangular box with a 50.0 cm x 50.0 cm base and a height of 100.0 cm.

11,Expanded Polystyrene in a chemical landfill,1578688722,"Hey r/askengineers! I work in the industrial field, cleaning up chemical spills. One of the plants I am contracted too, has a landfill that is full of old tanks and tankers that leak their contents into the environment. From what I understand, these have been buried here for 30/40+ years and the plant has taken actions in the past to reduce the damage of this (This specific plant used to be owned by General Electric). I also believe that they used to just dig a hole in the ground and back the tanker in, or drop the tank in, and just bury it. (I could be wrong, but for the sake of the question, let’s say that this is the case)

Now, I also used to work closely in an EPS (Expanded Polystyrene, or ‘Styrofoam’ essentially) factory that creates GeoFoam and similar EPS products. 

My question, is would it be practical to use EPS GeoFoam to reduce the effect of these chemicals leaking into the environment. The plant is on a river, and also about a mile away from a school. What I’ve been thinking (mind you, I am NOT an expert on this nor an engineer or anything close to either) is a “Grave” for these tanks/tankers, using concrete and dense  EPS GeoFoam around each specific tank. Idea two, is a EPS/Concrete perimeter to prevent chemicals from moving outwards towards the river. 

Assuming that these chemicals would not react negatively with the EPS, would it be practical? Would it make a difference?

22,Negotiate Salary from Initial Offer - Exchange Sign-on Bonus for Higher Salary? (USA),1578675756,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I received an offer for a Senior Engineer position (at a major defense contractor) which I am uniquely qualified based on 9+ years experience; when I asked why the position has been open for so long (4-mo), they said it was difficult to find someone with that exact skill set required for the position, and is exactly my experience. It requires a Top Secret Security Clearance (which I don't have but they don't expect any issues with me obtaining one based on pre-screening), and will transition to managing a team of 5-10 engineers. I also have a masters degree in the field. I have no baseline to judge how much the management and security clearance should affect the base compensation.

The offer includes a full relocation package, a base salary of $120k, and a 10% sign-on bonus. The base compensation is 10% lower than the minimum I stated I needed for the position during the interview. They commented that my minimum is well within the position's compensation band, so no issues there.

I'm considering countering their offer by waiving the sign-on bonus in exchange for higher base compensation. Is it unreasonable to ask for $140k base while keeping the relocation package? Is $135k a more reasonable base compensation in exchange for waiving the sign-on bonus?

We will have the whole robot lift itself on a V-shaped beam of Polycarb that can pivot at the V‘s bottom. Both far ends of the V will have a hook, which goes onto a hung that can tilt/ may be tilted (hence the pivot). What we want to figure out is what the optimal angle inbetween the V’s 2 arms is, and the corresponding thickness of the polycarb to handle the weight.

60,Need help verifying steel strap preload in the context of wood floor joist deflection,1578608403,"Please bear with me, I am not an engineer by training. Not a homework question either, just a redneck with an idea.	

&amp;nbsp;

I am trying to reinforce the floor of my house to eliminate as much bounce/deflection as I reasonably can. I have already sistered the joists that I’m reasonably able to, however there are a few that I can’t logistically sister because of pre-existing electrical, plumbing and HVAC. But I can get a long, thin, semi flexible piece of metal in the space.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, I want to pretension a steel strap and attach it to the underside of the joist. I’ve done the math but don’t have a way to easily verify my answer accuracy. See picture below for a visual of what I want to do.

&amp;nbsp;

The joists I want to reinforce is a 1.5” wide by 9” tall and 12’ long (actual dimensions) and 16” on center. It is supported on either side by about 3”, so total span is 11’ 6”. Good condition Douglass Fir, assumed 1.4GPa.

&amp;nbsp;

The strap is to be made of A36 steel, 3/8th thick, 1.5” wide, total length of 11’. The strap will be on the bottom of the joist, so it will be 9” offset from the point of maximum floor deflection (not sure what the term is for this). I assumed 29GPa.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to pretension the strap with an equivalent force of 10 pounds per square foot at 9” “above” the strap, I.E. the floor that is resting on the top of the joist.

&amp;nbsp;

My calculations come out to 1,369psi of preload on the strap. That number seems reasonable to me but I know precisely jack shit about any of this and could likely be way off base. Any help is appreciated.

98,Electrical engineer career development help?,1578543954,"First post here but I am looking for a bit of help in my career path.

I currently work as a distribution engineer at a local electric cooperative but it is basically a job with no growth, if I stay here I will probably be in this positionthe rest of my career. I have peaked out on my salary and am not challenged in my work anymore so I am looking to get into something new. I have been with this company for four years now and make $100,000 per year with good benefits.

I have two opportunities available to me. The first is as a power modeling engineer with a G&amp;T cooperative (generation and transmission) the offer is for 75k and is a much larger company. They have great benefits but as you see it would be a pretty decent pay cut. There is a potential path for me to get back up near where I currently am salary wise once I obtain my EIT certificate but it's no guarantee. There seems to be a lot of room for growth with this company as well. The position would be learning about SPP and running models based on market analysis and generation facilities on a daily basis. 

The second option is with another distribution cooperative as a system engineer. The position starts at 85k with great benefits as well. This company is about the same size as my current employer with not as much room to move up. I actually graduated college with a petroleum engineering degree and this company wanted me to go back to school to get an electrical engineering minor, and they would pay for any additional schooling required. Once that is complete I could also get my EIT. This position deals with modeling the electric system analyzing fault current, loading, power quality. I am much more familiar with this and it would probably be an easier transition. 

I guess I was wondering if anyone in the industry had any thoughts on what would be better for developing my career? Either way I will take a significant paycut but both options should give me room to grow much higher than my current position. I would also be moving to a lower cost of living city. Has anyone else taken a pay cut like this in the short term to move up in the long run?

99,How to excel in a field you aren’t passionate about?,1578543295,"Hello all,

Currently work as a EE with 1.5 years of experience in the power engineering field. Work at a utility doing substation protection, design, etc as well as helping with protection on transmission/ distribution end. The nature of this work is that it is very stable, necessary work for the sanctity of society and I am proud to pursue this field. There is a lot of work to be done and my job pays well with good benefits and light hours,  so in an ideal world “I am set”. 

The only problem is that I’m just not passionate about power. In general all aspects of the power field are quite dry and to an extent quite boring, as it’s hard  to see what you do in real life, unlike for example designing a robot. There’s very little imaginativeness in the field because it’s so set in stone, except maybe smart grid or utility control house, but in that case your job becomes more About software rather than traditional engineering. Even then, most of what your doing is VERY difficult to visualize or see up front. 

As a highly visual person who loves to see things happen in real life, I’ve found myself very much bored with sitting on a desk for designs and hardly ever going on-site, since we have another team to do on site things. 

As an EE, I would say I have always been interested in embedded software, RF, electronics design and ML. I don’t know what to do. I think I can do ok in this field but I just don’t have the passion to truly go above and beyond to get to some manager or higher level position. My question - Do I bust my balls by studying for PE, getting 5-8 more years, working my ass off then becoming a senior or maybe even manager making good money to fund my lifestyle/ more interesting hobbies? Utilities have a very old work force so it’s easy for young motivated bucks to get to manager really young, making really good money and getting to lead projects. 

Would it be a good idea to go back to school for a MS in CS or EE to get a more hands on job? I could do MS part time while working. I thought of a MS because I think it would be difficult to transfer substation design experience to a embedded software or electronics gig. 

Anyone have any advice or similar experience working in power? I just can’t do it anymore.",AskEngineers,False,throwyashizaway,/r/AskEngineers/comments/em4g2h/how_to_excel_in_a_field_you_arent_passionate_about/

I've been working in the industry for 2 years in the consulting industry. I realized early on that I enjoyed working on projects where the clients were real estate developers. I enjoy the initial stages of the project when it comes to developing the overall strategies (mostly work on ways to make the site more sustainable) but I notice that I lose interest when it comes to actually doing the design work. I've been recognized by senior management for my strong ""soft skills"" (ie. coordination, report writing, interpersonal and communication skills, relationship building, organization skills, etc.).  

Overall, I've realized that I don't see myself doing ""engineering"" work long-term (for some of the reasons noted above and the low overall salary) and I want to make some strategic moves now to transition into the business side of things. I'm not entirely sure what I would want to do in business but I think it would make sense to transition into the real estate developers/investment funds or sustainability where I can hopefully gain some more ""business"" experience within the same type of industry I currently work for. 

Main questions that I've been thinking about recently:

1. Is it better to get a post graduate diploma/certificate in business to obtain the business knowledge to make myself standout during applications? Should I get a masters? I do want to get an MBA at some point but I feel like it would be better to obtain that once I've established some more experience and ""path"" in my career. 
2. If so to 1, does it make sense to get a certificate in lets say finance and then get an MBA later on. I see quite a few certificates/diploma's in BA but if I plan on getting an MBA I think this would be sense. 
3. Thoughts on the real estate industry? Sustainability industry? Any other industries to consider?

From what I could tell, a lot of their projects were along the lines of analyzing how a new service will affect the nearby traffic. This is something I would be ok doing for a career, but it's not quite what drew me to transportation planning in the first place. I have always been intrigued by roads, specifically highways and especially interchanges. I'd love to know if working as a government traffic planner would allow me to play a part in working on the projects that have a large effect on the commuters in my area, and would allow me to make a difference in my community. So as a few more specific questions to clarify the title,

Are there different levels of DOTs (state, federal, etc.) And how do they compare?

Within said organizations, what is the role of the traffic planner vs. the traffic engineer?  How does this compare to 3rd party companies? 

Is working at a DOT a way to make a difference, or do they move as slow as the rest of government?

Are there perks to working in a government position as opposed to a 3rd party company, and vice versa, are there perks to not working for the government? 

What ways can I prepare for this career in high school?  (Obvious answers I'm already doing include Math/Science and CAD classes, which I am currently taking)

18,I'm building a garage...,1578522653,"For all sorts of reasons, building then enclosing a pole barn makes the most financial sense. Mainly, the roof trusses for this purpose are reasonable in price, and can be spaced liberally. I'm looking for height without building 14-16ft walls. I'm installing a automotive lift.

The plan: 24x48ft garage with 12 ft walls (4x6 or 6x6 posts), 12 ft spacing on trusses and 10x10 garage doors between posts, 2x6 purlins and metal roofing, enclosed with 24"" spacing with 2x6s and metal siding, insulation, the lot...

The problem: I have an existing slab that's 27x50. It's sloped a bit, but I can shim for it. Pole barns are meant for the posts to be buried 1ft for every 4 they are above ground. However unless I build larger than the slab or cut sections out for this purpose and re-pour concrete, I'm limited to anchoring them to the concrete.

I realize the issue with this is that the weight of the roof applies lateral pressure  to the posts, and a heavy snow could just fold the walls out.

The question is, what if I used say, 1/2"" structural cable under tension between the posts at the joint with the truss. This would not affect my garage bay headroom, would actually be adjustable and flexible, but strong.

Another option is a beam to run along the bottom of the truss connecting the poles so as to transfer the pressure down instead of sideways. 

Should I look for a truss manufacturer who makes them like the ones in residential housing? Worried about my budget a lot.

Sorry if this is long, but looking for some insight, as I’m a little worried about whether or not my secret clearance will be accepted or denied.

I’ve been working at a US defense contractor for the past 6 months and submitted the e-qip a few months ago.  Last month I had an interview with an investigator in which he grilled me for 2 hours on some drug and alcohol stuff I listed on SF-86. 

Some background on the drugs I did, I did molly and cocaine once and took adderall and smoked weed about quarterly in college. I graduated about 5 years ago and have not done any drugs since. All of these were listed on my SF-86.

As far as alcohol is concerned, I had an incident in college (over 7 years ago) where I had to be EMSed because I had passed out at a bus stop while waiting for a bus while I was severely intoxicated. This resulted in me being removed from school-provided housing but I was not disciplined academically. 

I listed this incident in the SF-86 but there were a couple of minor incidents leading up to this that I did not listed but brought up in the interview as I didn’t think they were necessary/fit the question on the form. One for instance was 6 months prior to the EMS incident. I was with a group of “friends” walking to a party with alcohol in my backpack when all of a sudden a cop “pulled us over”. The cops searched our bags and obviously found the alcohol in our bags and took down all our names and made us dump the alcohol. Since I was the only one who didn’t have a photo ID, I gave them my student ID for their record which was then given to the school and I was reprimanded accordingly. 

I didn’t list this because i thought that because it didn’t involve me getting arrested or other safety personnel getting involved (ie EMS) I didn’t need to, but I figured I should tell the interviewer every little detail as to leave no stone unturned.

I told the interviewer that at this point in my life, I drink only once or twice a week and only have around 1-5 when I do. I also told him I maybe get intoxicated 1-2 a year. In no way am I “partying” like I was in college and I know what my limits are.

I was confident before submitting the e-qip that I would be completely fine, but since the interview, some doubt is starting to creep into my mind. I haven’t heard yet whether or not my interim was approved/denied, but co-workers that started at or after me have already received their interim. I know I’m probably a long shot from getting my interim, but am I also a long shot from getting my full secret? If I am denied, what will be the show-stopper?

where re is the radius of the earth, and x1, y1, z1 are the integrated values of velocity.  
  
Our coordinate system is an east-north-up (ENU) coordinate system. So z1 could be a lot larger of a value than the altitude if you're far downrange from the origin (which is on the runway.) That's what's happening in this case, my ha is around 50000 while my altitude is around 10000 (the altitude I reset the aircraft to.) This causes my static pressure to go negative because it's generated using interpolation and that's an altitude out of the range.  
  
So I guess my questions are:  
- does any of what I'm saying make sense?  
- would it be appropriate to just set my ha = the user input altitude (in this case, 10000)? If so, how can I compute my z position from x,y, and altitude?",AskEngineers,False,synchh,/r/AskEngineers/comments/elxg5m/altitude_vs_z_in_simulator/

Graduate school has always been on my horizon, and I’m looking to pursue that for the Fall of 2020. I recently came across a program for a Masters of Professional Studies in Applied Intelligence and it looks like the type of program that could set me up for the type of role I’m looking for down the line. While I love the hands-on, technical nature of engineering, my long term goals were to get involved at a “higher” level. My ultimate goal would be to work in some sort of advisory/think tank role about cybersecurity policies, strategies, etc. 

So that’s why I find the Applied Intel program to be so appealing. However, I’m worried that getting that degree at this stage (I’m 23, and will have worked for 1 year by the time of enrollment) would put me in the weird position of having a degree for a position that’s above my experience.

Due to the lousy economic situation in my country (it's a developing country, very big problems here) I couldn't find a job, and I still can't (they're extremely limited and connected people get them).  I settled for working in a bakery and other menial jobs but now that I'm older (I'm 28) I realize I can't afford to live a normal life like this (getting paid $6 a day) and I need to use my degree and move out or something, I have no engineering experience whatsoever other than my school projects (and a lousy internship at a telecom galvanizing plant) and even my projects were limited in scope and were strictly designs (a product design proposal and feasibility study for a gadget, a gearbox, and a complete machine design for a rock crusher, and some thermodynamics stuff for my capstone).  I also picked up machining and g-code in school, don't know how much help that is.

So my question actually has multiple parts.

Will ABET accreditation matter for my resume?

38,Damaged Roof Truss Gusset Plate - Need Help!,1578502559,"**The Problem:**

I bought a home and the previous owner hired a garage door company that really jacked up the installation. They cut out a significant amount of the center gusset plate on my 24' span Howe truss to make room for the door chain (pictures 1 and 2). I'd estimate 50% of of the bottom chord was cut out through the gusset plate. They bolted metal to add support (also shown in pictures 1 and 2). It has been like this for two years and there was no problems with heavy snow last winter, but I want to get this fixed so I can close up my ceiling and insulate.

*Picture 1 -* [*http://cubeupload.com/im/hawkengineer/Picture1.jpg*](http://cubeupload.com/im/hawkengineer/Picture1.jpg)

*Picture 2 -* [*http://cubeupload.com/im/hawkengineer/Picture2.jpg*](http://cubeupload.com/im/hawkengineer/Picture2.jpg)

I'm installing a side motor to open and close the garage, so the metal chain guide will be remove and I wanted to properly fix the damage before closing the ceiling. Two other trusses were also damaged, but not nearly as severely (pictures 3 and 4).

*Picture 4 -* [*http://cubeupload.com/im/hawkengineer/Picture4.jpg*](http://cubeupload.com/im/hawkengineer/Picture4.jpg)

**My Idea for the Solution:**

Before doing anything, I will use an angle grinder to gently grind away the gusset plate that is bent up. This will create a flush profile on either side.

After doing some reading, I thought that screwing in a 8' 2x4 on both sides (from center) will do the trick. I'd use 10d screws, staggered ever 2 inches on either side (see this PDF for an example:  [https://www.mitek-us.com/uploadedFiles/\_RedesignSite/Content/documents/engineering/details/roof-truss-repair-details/ENG-Roof-Broken%20chors.pdf](https://www.mitek-us.com/uploadedFiles/_RedesignSite/Content/documents/engineering/details/roof-truss-repair-details/ENG-Roof-Broken%20chors.pdf))

Another option I saw was to secure 1/2' plywood gusset plates on either side, using this PDF as a guide:  [https://www.mitek-us.com/uploadedFiles/\_RedesignSite/Content/documents/engineering/details/roof-truss-repair-details/ENG-ROOF-Missing%20Plate.pdf](https://www.mitek-us.com/uploadedFiles/_RedesignSite/Content/documents/engineering/details/roof-truss-repair-details/ENG-ROOF-Missing%20Plate.pdf)

I'm building a DIY EFI system for a small single cylinder engine. 

Since I'll be using a gasoline fuel injector from a 4 cylinder car engine, the fuel has to be pressurized. 

For that I need a pump, so I thought if I could use a simple water pump. There's no info given about those so I can't really tell. I know that I shouldn't use a water pump since gasoline could damage it, but this isn't anything longwhile, more like just some hobby stuff.

Also, a standard fuel injector works at 50-60 PSI of pressure, and as I was searching, I saw a pump that delivers 5-6 PSI, but is stated that the pump can be used for fuel injection/EFI, so that's why I'm asking.

In some accounts of the workings of a liquid ring pump, the liquid ring is shown in the diagram having constant depth all round the circumference; in others it is shown deeper on the side _towards_  the (eccentrically mounted) axis of the impellor, so that it _actually adds_  to the depth to which the impellor blades are immersed in the liquid ring.

66,"Out of these options, which design choice seems optimal?",1578429909,"Say one were looking to build a drone-like device where instead of the typical design where four props are placed equidistant from the center, and above the weight being lifted, the props would be underneath all the weight. The device would need to be as small as possible while still being able to lift at least 180lbs, dynamically rebalance itself from any shifts in weight, and be in the air for more than just a few seconds.

Now, I’ve compiled a few different designs, but I’m not able to figure out which one would be optimal.

**The First**
Two larger, ducted props are placed beside each other, each with a swashplate that, in theory, should be capable of balancing any weight shifts the device experiences. Would this even work?

**The Second**
Four ducted props are placed in a rectangular fashion. Balancing would simply be done by dynamically fluctuating the RPMs of the rotors.

**The Third**
Align many smaller, ducted props along the underside of the device in a grid or staggered grid like fashion. Balancing would be done in the same way as option two.

I have worked in a manufacturing setting where there has been a lot of automation. I.e pick and place robots, automated manufacturing cells etc. As a manufacturing engineer we work primarily with processes and manufacturing improvements. We can identify need for automation but then if the project is approved we have ""automation engineers"" who would take care of the design/programming and specing out of the automation for the project. 

I think that this would be a very interesting job and I have searched and seen job postings like this but most of these jobs require many years of experience with automation and PLC programming/wiring. My question is what can I do to make myself into a viable candidate for jobs of this nature? I am not completely set on working in a manufacturing setting, that is just where i have the most experience and exposure. 

I have considered a masters degree in automation/mechatronics or something along those lines but there are not colleges local to me that offer those programs. I have also considered just taking some automation/PLC classes that are offered at a local technical college. But I am not sure if just taking a few classes would look good to future employers. What can I do to make myself more viable to these jobs? Are there any good self learning options that I could do to see if I really am interested in this line of work? If you are an automation engineer, how did you learn/get your first job in the field? 

By the way I do not work at the company that used a lot of automation anymore. The company i work at now is a smaller shop that does not really do any automation so asking to play a larger role in the automation projects is not an option at this point.

Since I only have a Bachelor's degree, will it hinder me going forward with possible promotions or job opportunities or is experience and knowledge valued more?

My main thought is that some job roles require a Masters so that would be a barrier for me getting an interview no mater how much knowledge I might potentially have.

My manager suggested that I do a PhD rather than a masters as he believes I have the right attitude for it. He said the company can pay me while I work on my PhD full time.

Cons: 


-age, employers will surely ask why I've wasted so much time and I'm not sure what can I answer with to that. I'm a former addict is an obvious no no imo.


-school, explained above 


-I dont feel ready, I dont feel like an engineer either


-low gpa, at around 2.8


-never learnt to work systematically so I'm generally doing everything in very short amounts of time driving the quality of my work down.


-no internships or projects at all


-state mental ward certified high functioning autism but I'm pretty sure I can just not talk about it.


-no vision, no creativity, I'm not very elastic in the way I think. Probably related to above.


Pros:


-I'm determined, pretty much turned my life around and I'm willing to further improve 


-self taught english and french. English is probably at C1 level, french is delf certified B2 level.


-Erasmus experience under my belt.


-a good grasp of theoritical subjects


-Have an iq test from a the said ward, I have certified 157iq. Although you cant market this as it makes you sound like a douche and a liar


-Spent 2 years acting in school's theater group, went to many festivals (not sure if its any good on a resume though)

-The city is highly industrial, I may be able to find good internships


-School is pretty active in engineering projects, I may be able to join them

25,[RANT] Where is the incentive for the smartest/ above average students in USA to pursue traditional engineering jobs?,1578330651,"I’d like to start a debate.
There are the 3 classical engineering paths.
EE - Electrical/Computer
CivE - Civil
ME - mechanical 


Ive come to realize the classical engineering jobs stinks. Want a cool job that pays a lot? Like designing an engine, designing a cpu? Too bad, you basically need a PhD to do that. Then you get your PhD in civil or ME and pull ~$90- $100k out of school? 


Now software engineering comes in. Literally disrupts the entire classical engineering industry. Sucks up talent from the top schools because think about it. If you’re a smart kid from an ivy why would you do civil (even if you love it) when google will be recruiting paying you twice as much starting with a super vibrant office environment in an amazing city? If your smart enough to get into an Ivy you could absolutely do CS. 

Anyone ever wonder why so many engineering students from top schools go consulting, finance or even software? Hint hint: these kids are smart as hell and know they are better off not being engineers. There was a time long ago when engineers (classical) were more respected than doctors because only the smartest kids became engineers. Now? The smartest kids go software so they can pull $200k in 5 years. What engineer job pays $200k for 5 years even if you’re a literal genius? I know engineering managers with 15 years making  $150k. Where is the incentive for the 36 ACT/ 4.0 GPA, Ivy League bound kid to pursue any of the engineering fields? Why the hell would this kid work for his electric utility or a manufacturing plant when he sits in a nice comfortable office at FB or Google making bank? Even the kid who doesn’t go to FAANG makes more than engineers. Software engineers in my city start at $70k while engineers start at $65k. This is a major city (one of the largest in USA) so there are WAY more job openings for software engineers. Even your average to above average (not a target school) CS person has:
Easier access to jobs
Way more opportunity in terms of location 
Better salary
Work culture better (traditional engineering firms have a stick up their ass) 


If you are motivated, smart and work hard in school you absolutely shouldn’t do engineering. You should go software. You don’t need to go to Stanford to
Get a software job with a bank or a company that isn’t FAANG. I go to a state school and know a few kids interning at Twitter. Don’t like coding? Oh boy, as a CivE, ME or EE who doesn’t code you’ll probably be doing loads of CAD work which is like coding for
Babies. It is very boring and monotone.


And when that hypothetical kid above graduates, he gets to choose between designing an APP, maybe the backend for a website, maybe some ML or Data analytics? Maybe a startup?

# A university ‘welcomed’ everyone but men in STEM events. A professor filed a Title IX complaint

***‘Female, non-binary and non-cisgender students’***

Marketing materials from a series of events at the University of Cincinnati suggest that they were not open to men, though the administration insists men were allowed to participate.

First brought to light [**Friday**](https://twitter.com/Mark_J_Perry/status/1213131365681696769?s=19) by University of Michigan-Flint economist Mark Perry, a [**UC press release**](https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/2019/09/n20856888.html) from September shows that the only group not explicitly “welcomed” to the events was men who identify as men.

The release is titled “UC director of women in engineering announces fall programming for STEM students,” referring to Paula Lampley. Her position is based in the College of Engineering and Applied Science’s Office of Inclusive Excellence and Community Engagement.

The subtitle: “All female, non-binary and non-cisgender students are welcomed to attend all events.”

After a heavy rain, the flow increases significantly and has at times overflowed the banks and covered the bridge.

I  am interested in attaching a meter to the center of the bridge to monitor the depth of the water an potentially provide a rate-of-rise alarm. My thought is to enclose a LoRa board (with battery and possibly  solar) inside a waterproof case and have some sort of sensor monitoring the depth.

I am unsure what the best type of sensor would be for this application as the area is exposed to the elements and has the potential for debris floating by.

\- I like engineering in its process assessment aspect

\- I like technology.

It's still high level at this point, we'll get into the weeds later on.

Right now they've proposed thermal, then vibration, then rain (for the assembly housing the card) and humidity. My instinct would be to do humidity first, as corrosion would weaken the solder joints for vibe tests later. Some standards we have say that in general vibe should be done first (in the humidity section). The vibe section of the standard says that it should generally be conducted early ""unless another test would damage the assembly such that it might negatively impact the fatigue life"".

56,How to figure out salary expectations at a startup?,1578288886,"Context: Graduating on time Spring 2020 with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, had a summer internship with a startup engineering I.T. company specializing in the oil, gas, and energy industry. The internship wasn't in my ""field"" but I was looking for any real-world experience and got it after being referenced from a friend who worked there, and after striking out with multiple companies interviews etc.   


Now, I've been applying to jobs for the past two months and haven't had really much luck, the job search has been following the same path at my internship job search a year ago, with no replies, rejections, etc. I'm heavily considering working at the same company I interned for now. I'm currently back interning with them for the winter to help them out, my team leader and his boss frequently mention how they want me to come back and work after graduation full time and I received an excellent performance review from the summer. However, all of these talks have been informal and I haven't received a formal offer, however, I feel that if I were to express my interest in 100% coming back then that talk would ensue. My only problem is I have no idea the salary range of what to expect or ask for if that does happen and currently that is the biggest factor in my job search. As of now, I haven't had any interviews for any other companies or anything else promising in my job search, however, a lot can change in the semester before graduation.   
I can't look up salary data because of the nature of the new startup there's not much readily available information out there. The pay for interns is decent and the employees of the parent company that owns the startup average around &gt;90k (process and systems engineering).    


Should I just straight up ask my boss what he makes? What's the best way to start that conversation? Should I do this before I know I have other offers that could potentially happen? I don't want to end up in a beggars can't be choosers situation if I have no other offers, but I don't want to commit to this company if the starting salary is around 50k which is what my personal guess is based off certain subtle context clues I've picked up but I could be completely wrong (some of my intern friends thank it's closer to 70k).

72,Advice for an Environmental EIT struggling at first career job?,1578257079,"Hey AskEngineers, 

Like the title says I am about 1.5 years into my first job after graduating from university. I work as a “staff engineer,” at a larger consulting firm in the United States. 

I am having a really hard time staying positive with my current position. The large majority of what I do for my position is, “construction oversight.” Typically this means that I work 12 hours a day, usually spending 10 of those hours sitting in my pickup truck watching the construction crews work. All of the projects I work on are mine closures and the tasks that I oversee are usually: water well drilling &amp; development, adit closure, and earth work. My average amount worked per week is 50 hours for the last 1.5 year.

The work I have been doing isn’t terrible and I actually do enjoy working with the construction crews. However, my problem with this job is that this is all I ever do. I have really been pushing hard to get more involved with doing more design &amp; analysis work or even basic reporting work.

Despite my attempts to get more involved in the office I keep getting told things like: “Oh once we hire more field staff we can get you more involved” or “well we really need you out there because you are super reliable and the PM wants you onsite.” All of those responses are reasonable and I see where they come from. However every response is followed up with, “...but we know you have been working in the field a lot and we will try our hardest to get you more office work to give you a break.”

However I am finding it hard to not be bitter when the few times I am in the office the only work I am give is updating spreadsheets and cleaning the work trucks, but most the time I don’t get any work and I sit in the office asking engineers in other offices if I can get involved with their projects. Typically they don’t want to get me involved because I am usually always in the field and would have enough time to complete their tasks. 

With all of that background laid out, here are my main gripes that cause me to feel depressed/ bitter: 

1.) I am a very ambitious person and I feel that I can bring so much more value to my office other than just being a “warm body.” 

2.) There are other field geology staff that are senior to me by 2 years and they pretty much refuse to do the construction oversight, unless absolutely necessary. Even when they do the oversight work they always leave early and trash talk doing the field work while they are there. Yet turn around and tell me I should be thankful for the opportunity to work on these projects. 

3.) They have hired additional field staff, but they work more on SVE system O&amp;M and don’t have the same crazy schedules as me. 

4.) I am the only person with an engineering degree in my office, everyone else are either hydro geologists or geologists. The only engineer I interact with works out of Denver, I rarely see or talk to him and I am honestly worried that he won’t sign off on my experience toward the PE requirement. 

5.) Despite being told that they are working on getting me more involved in the work I desire, I still have yet to see any results in the year since I first started making this known. 

My end of the year performance review was great, and my supervisors had nothing but good things to say. I also have my masters in environmental engineering with a GPA of 3.83, so it’s not that they don’t think I would be capable of doing more than sitting in a truck. 

I apologize for the wall of text, I am just stuck at work on a Sunday again, by myself and I am feeling really down about myself. I would really appreciate some advice on what I should do. Should I continue to apply for different jobs? Should I keep talking to my supervisor about these issues?

79,Thoughts on negotiating a higher salary after already accepting initial offer?,1578244376,"TLDR: When is it too late to negotiate an offer?

I’m graduating this year and look forward to working for a company in the petrochemical field after graduation. 

I received a full-time offer from them in September and signed soon after. But now I’m having some second thoughts about compensation. The salary is great, but at least $2k less than I expected. For PTO, there are no sick days, only vacation days and holiday days and the option to buy more vacation time.

Currently, I’m thinking of contacting them to ask for a $2k raise and use the justification that I could theoretically buy more vacation days to make up for the lack of sick days.

Is it a mistake to try and negotiate months later, even if I won’t start work for another 6months+? Should I wait til my 1st yr performance review?

I’m just worried about never trying to negotiate then ending up SOL by banking on a review.",AskEngineers,False,BisonOwlGK,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ekfs45/thoughts_on_negotiating_a_higher_salary_after/
80,How to achieve entry-level Mechanical Engineering job/internship in Canada?,1578243464,"Greetings!

I just graduated from University of Windsor with a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering (M.Eng - Automotive Option). I've been looking for and applying to jobs for the past four months without success. 

I've been applying on Indeed and LinkedIN for all entry-level positions, internships and positions that require less than 2-3 years of experience. I have reached out to seniors &amp; HR professionals of various organizations on LinkedIn asking for advice on how to enter their companies, have been fortunate to receive a few replies but nothing in terms of steps for attaining a job. I have also visited the Careers portal on some of the companies' sites and applied for a few positions again in vain. I have made sure to tailor my resume and cover letter to the needs of the companies and explain how my experience meet their requirements.

I am currently living in Stoney Creek and have a vehicle, I am open to relocate anywhere in Canada and will not require sponsorship now or in the future. I have decent grades, reference from my manager at my previous part-time job and a strong desire to enter the field in entry-level Mechanical engineering jobs or as an intern.

**Can anyone please tell me if there is something that I have been missing or doing wrong?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous information and a personal bit:

I entered Master's at the end of my Bachelor's in NIT, Surat (Gujarat, India) so I don't have any work or co-op experience. From 2nd year onwards, I have spend most of my summers at the school, at the end of second and third year, I was involved in FSAE mainly responsible for Chassis design, material selections and construction. At the end of third year I was enrolled in CAD and FEA training at Red &amp; White academy in Surat. I am deeply passionate about automobiles and design. I am certified in Solidworks and have used the software to design various FSAE vehicle parts, pneumatic vice and chair made of cardboard to name a few. 

I have decent grades (87% in masters and 77% in undergrad) and took part in various University level competitions in Undergrad such as Robowars, inter-year basketball, automotive quiz etc. During master's program, I was a member of Student Advisory Council responsible for holding events such as Career Workshop, introduction to APQP course, updating students in-person and on social media about various events, etc. I was working part-time as a Go-kart attendant too.

I am an international student who dreamt about working in the Automotive Industry in Windsor as soon as I graduated but unfortunately, Ford (FoMoCo) &amp; FCA ARDC (Automotive Research &amp; Development Centre) hires only MSc. students from University of Windsor. I wish I knew this before applying for the program, I would have definitely strived to enter the Msc. program. That being said, the M.Eng program was very a very decent program with knowledgeable professors who worked in the industry that introduced application of various topics such as Fluid Mechanics, Heat transfer and brought the opportunity to learn software such as Star-CCM+, LS-DYNA, Hyperworks/Hypermesh and Abaqus CAE.

Attaining a meaningful job has probably been the biggest challenge in my life. So far, I 've always had a path defined for me to follow, Highschool --&gt; Undergrad --&gt; Masters, this is the first time I don't have something definite to do and I feel like I'm wasting time. I feel like I've done everything right, attended every class, studied well and yet I don't have something that I deserve. I am yearning for the one chance to enter a company where I will can study as deep as possible into the field because I know I will have practical application for it &amp; strive to excel as an employee.

85,What are some alternative career options for a recent engineering graduate with some experience who's having a really hard time finding an engineering position?,1578229682,"Hola, amigos! 

So I graduated from a large public university with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in February 2019. From March through end of August I worked as a mechanical engineer at a very large defense contractor. Unfortunately, I had unexpected family medical stuff (older parents) come up that forced me to move back home, so I've been looking for a job ever since. 

I also had a previous 6 month co-op at the same engineering employer, a 3.1 gpa and professional references to boot, but alas no luck. I'm trying to find something asap since its early in the new year. I've had a couple places express interest but they usually wind up ghosting, without any apparent explanation. 

With that said, what *are* some options for a (pretty much) recent graduate with limited previous experience? If push comes to shove, I have extended family that will soon be able to take over my personal obligations and let me look nationwide if needed. 

To be very blunt, I'm starting to doubt whether or not I'll be able to find an engineering position again, and am looking into all possible options. What should a person in my situation do/consider? Part of me considers it an opportunity to explore another field perhaps I never knew I'd like.

88,"Found out new hires are making 4k more than me, I’ve been working 6 months. Would it be okay to ask for a bigger raise in lieu of this?",1578213399,"As a new grad (software engineer) at a major defense company I make 76k and have been working for six months. I just found out that the new hires with no experience starting this month were offered 80k. Part of the problem might be that I signed my contract back in summer 2018 when the market rate was lower.

Our annual performance discussion will be held sometime late Feb (they weren’t too clear on this), and we are getting our raises in March. I wanted to bring this up and maybe ask for my salary to be bumped to around 85k... 4k just for being brought up to our companies market value, and then 5k as part of the actual raise (it will be 9-10 months working there by the time I get the raise). 

Now I know to ask for a big raise you need to provide a decent business case to show you are worth it, which I probably can’t do because let’s be real, most new hires aren’t super important; they’re actually costing the company money. 

But is the fact that new hires are getting more than me a valid point to bring up? I should be making at least the same as them, and actually I believe I should be making more if we were both hired with 0 experience for the same title in the same department and I’ve already been there for 6 months.

I guess my questions are

0. Is this a valid reason to ask to be compensated fairly at 80k?

1. Should I wait until my annual review meeting or should I bring it up with my manager sooner so he knows my concerns? Someone told me that these big defense companies pre-decide how much to give you so if you wait until the meeting, the money has already all been divided up and they won’t be able to do much


2. If the current rate is 80k, I expect being brought up from 76k to 80k to not be a part of the raise. That should just be putting me up to our companies market value. Is this line of thinking correct? So would it be fair asking for like 85k? 4k to be brought up to par with others, and 5k as my expected raise. Is this reasoning fair or would this get shut down, because they’d basically be adding 9k to my salary... which I guess seems like a big jump but in my mind I only see it as a 5k bump because I should be getting 80k anyways.

89,Why aren't AND gates made up of simple a single NPN transitor?,1578204884,"When I was looking at schematics of how AND gates are made it led me to think why does it involve 2 NPN transitors. AND gates require both inputs to be ""on"" for there to be an output signal, then why aren't AND gates made up of a single transistor. Transistors require the collector to be ""on"" and aswell as the base to be ""on"". If the base is ""on"" and the collector isn't then no power goes through and vice versa. So truth table wise AND gates and NPN transistors both match, so why do AND gate schematics use 2 transistors? 

I understand how AND gates work with the 2 transistor set up as it is, I just dont understand why it can't be made simpler with just one transistor? The reason for why this is is probably because of some other reason outside a simple truth table that I just don't know about.

99,Question about conservation of momentum in space.,1578185551,"Hello,

I am trying to figure out how conservation of angular momentum is conserved with two free-drifting bodies in space.

This is assuming that no other forces are acting on the objects, just the forces of their collisions and nothing is lost to heat or sound. If both bodies are headed towards each other and have a starting angular velocity of 0, then a collision occurs that causes the bodies to get stuck together or dock, the force of the collision will cause a moment on the bodies and the bodies will begin to spin at the same rate. 

If the objects velocities and angular rates are observed from an inertial reference frame such as the moon, then mathematically how are both of the objects angular momentum conserved?

Since the angular velocity for both objects is zero from the inertial reference frame, then mathematically the angular momentum of the system is 0:

        (ang Vel1) X (inertial matrix1) = (Angular Momentum1)
        [0, 0, 0] X [Inertial Matrix1] = [0,0,0] 

        (ang Vel2) X (inertial matrix2) = (Angular Momentum2)
        [0, 0, 0] X [Inertial Matrix1] = [0,0,0] 

        Total Angular Momentum = 0

After the collision, the objects impart a force on each other and thus cause an angular velocity. Thus the final angular moment of the system is X:

        (Final ang Vel1) X (inertial matrix1) = (Final Angular Momentum1) 
         [X, Y, Z] X [Inertial Matrix1] = [AngMom1] 

        (Final ang Vel2) X (inertial matrix2) = (Final Angular Momentum2) 
         [X2, Y2, Z2] X [Inertial Matrix2] = [AngMom2] 

        Final Total Angular Momentum = AngMom2 + AngMom1 =!= 0

If my simple calculations above are correct then the only way for angular momentum to be conserved is if the final angular velocity is 0, or that the angular momentum of object1 is the opposite of object2, which if the angular velocity is equal because they are stuck together (docked) then their inertias have to be the opposite and equal as well, but this wouldn't work for objects of different size and mass.

6,How do steam locomotives prevent wear and keep good seals in the piston?,1578172958,"I have been trying to design a little model air engine that runs in the same way as a typical steam locomotive, in that the air feed will go into a piston valve that feeds a double-acting cylinder, with a walschaerts valve gear.

While I think I will be able to build it, I am not so sure about whether such a design will be long lasting or very effective at maintaining pressure. Obviously it works for full-sized locos, but it seems intuitive to me that air would too readily escape past the shafts that push and pull on the piston valve and the driving piston, or that, without being able to keep those shafts well-lubricated, the bores they push through will wear from the force applied by the conrod at the crosshead that pushes and pulls the shafts up and down in the bores.

Are there seals that are suitable to be put in the bores these shafts will be moved through, and will typical assembly grease be retained in the needed places when air is blown through the engine if it does escape?

7,"Recent grad, no job, next steps?",1578171467,"I graduated in Spring 2019 with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Structural Engineering and have been on the job hunt ever since. I have 2 internships under my belt and took on leadership positions in two engineering clubs in undergrad. 

I've had some (phone) interviews, most notably with Boeing and Virgin Galactic, and one in-person interview with a local aerospace company but haven't received any offers yet.

It's been 6 months now and student loans are getting due.
I do have a part time job working at a local education center doing SAT prep and tutoring middle school and high school students in Math, but that is only bringing in so much.

I'm at a point now where I have to choose what my next steps are going to be.

I have two possible routes.
1. Build on my skill set and spend money (~$500) to get a certification in something (I elaborate on what below) 
2. Get a job as a technician and work my way up in the company. 

For the first option- I'm looking into Lean Six Sigma and wondering if I should shift gears and go into Quality Engineering, instead of Aerospace/Mechanical Design like I originally hoped.
With the research I've done ASQ seems to be the best resource but for a recent grad like me, I'm only eligible for their Certified Quality Process Analyst (CQPA). Most job postings I've seen are looking for the Green Belt Certification or higher, but the requirements for that are that you need to be working in the Engineering or Q.A field for 3 years.
If you have a certification or experience in Q.E I would greatly appreciate your advice in this matter and whether I should pursue it. 

For the second option - I've read 80% of people get jobs through networking.
I've sent in at least 200 job applications online through Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, company websites, etc etc but that way isn't working out.
If I apply and work as a technician in an Aerospace company, though it's going to be physically grueling, I'll be in a much better position to meet and network with engineers and managers, and when an engineering spot opens up, I will have a good chance of getting it.
I'll be meeting more engineers than at my current job, that's for sure.


I'm at an impasse at which path to take and so I appreciate any and all input from this sub.

EDIT:  The sealer is being supplied by a reciprocating displacement pump to the gear pump. So the pressure build up in front of gear occurs between the cycles. As soon as the gear pump opens up, inlet pressure drops from 4000 psi to 2500 psi range, until the process is finished. Then the inlet pressure starts to rise again as the gear pump closes between the cycles. Unfortunately I can't regulated the pressure from the source, as any such action starves the process. So if I set my pressure regulator at 3000 psi, how will it behave when the inlet pressure drops below the set pressure? I have spec'ed pressure regulator in the past to reduce air pressure from constant plant supply to required constant amount. The fact that my supply pressure fluctuates and might go below my set pressure kind of confuses me. As this pressure regulator for sealer fluid is ""air operated"".

23,Which lubrication oil to pick for the linear ways and slides of a chinese 1325 CNC Mill?,1578151497,"Dear /r/AskEngineers,

I recently got a Chinese 1325 CNC Router for wood and plastics, very similar to this machine: http://www.magiccnc.com/en/3amcmc/988.html

It looks like it has HIWIN 20 or HIWIN 25 linear glides. All linear rails and guides are centrally lubricated with two manual oil pumps. The machine came with full tanks, now we've used them nearly all. 

Thing is - the manufacturer never stated what Oils to use. I looked up the guides of the manufacturer of the linear rails (HIWIN), I found this:
https://www.hiwin.com/pdf/lubricating_instructions.pdf

My issue: I dont know what is important and the values seem so different. 

&gt; 7.3.1 Standard applications 
&gt; 
&gt; * Load ratio: max. 15 % of the dynamic basic load rating
&gt; * Temperature range: -10 °C … 80 °C
&gt; * Speed: &lt; 1 m/s
&gt; * Speed coefficient: &lt; 120,000
&gt; 
&gt; Recommended oils:
&gt; 
&gt; * Klüber Klüberoil GEM 1-150 N
&gt; * Mobil Mobilgear 630
&gt; * Fuchs Lubritech GEARMASTER CLP 320 
    
I am not even sure if we are using the ""7.3.1 Standard applications"" or the ""7.3.2 Heavy-duty applications""

What I found out is that the recommended oil have viscositys between 150 and 320 ISO VG. We are using the machine in a space, that can go up to -10°C in the coldest winter nights. So I guess a more liquid and less viscose oil is in order? So should I go for lower numbers or higher numbers?

What am I missing? What oil should I get?

30,Mechanical engineer with a math degree?,1578121590,"TL;DR - I just got my bachelor’s degree in applied math, but really want to work as a mechanical engineer. What is the best way to transition into this?

Hi all,

When I started my math degree, I think I subconsciously knew that I liked engineering more. I do still love math, but as I’ve been searching for a job, I’ve realized that the vast majority of math jobs are in data science. I think data science is somewhat interesting, and I do like machine learning, but my interest in these areas doesn’t compare to that of fluid mechanics, design, thermo, robotics, etc.

I am considering going back to school for engineering. My soft plan so far is to take 7 or 8 classes at a community college (dynamics, mechanics of materials, etc), before enrolling in an MS program, likely in mechanical engineering. I am calling it a soft plan because in this plan, I would continue my job search in hopes of receiving an interesting offer, after which I’d continue taking engineering courses, but at a slower rate. 

My main concern is not the time or the money it will take me to get into an engineering career, but the path that takes me there. Particularly, I know that I would have a narrower understanding of engineering with an MS compared to a BS. And I also know that, in order to be a licensed professional engineer, one must have an ABET accredited degree, which I’m pretty sure implies a BS. 

However, I feel that getting a second bachelor’s would make my BS in applied math a waste of time. Also, no field has interested me more than fluid mechanics - and it has been this way for 5 years. Having said that, I feel that I wouldn’t need the broad knowledge gained from a BS, and the MS may even be better since it’s specialized in fluid/thermo.

31,What advice would you give for a self-doubting engineer in despair?,1578120100,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account. I would like to first declare that I am not trying to be negative. On the contrary, I am sick of negativity. I am legitimately asking for help, because my situation is fairly unique. I'll try to keep this as short and swift, using numbers, in case you want to refer to a specific point.

**Part A:**

1. Got into engineering after graduating top of my class in school. I loved math mostly and science by extension.
2. I loved aircraft, robots, and AI back then and so I studied Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Math.
3. I realized during my 2nd year, that I was not enjoying the material, but I couldn't swap as I had already worked so hard to pay for the passed credits. I'd also lose an Engineering scholarship partially funding me.
4. I sucked it up and pushed harder while working to pay my tuition, ended up graduating with a 3.7 GPA.
5. I confess, it was less out of me mastering the material, and more out of me gaming the system and finding hacks to maximize grades while minimizing study time as I had much work to tend to.
6. I grew to hate most of the subjects. I don't know if I should blame myself or the academic system which made me abhor it further.
7. I am very business-inclined, I enjoy finance and business-related subjects. I realized I was getting worse at tedious work.
8. I am really good at math and thinking programmatically. But I could not bring myself to practice enough coding, I only did it when I had to, because it would feel like torture.
9. As a result, I am a terrible programmer. The same goes with most engineering tools I 'learned'. I knew enough to ace my requirements, but otherwise my practical skills in them are absolutely horrid.
10. I actively try to read technical books, follow tutorials, and have tried multiple strategies. I keep choking.
11. Note I am not a slacker by nature. I am extremely hard-working with very good discipline and habits. When it comes to the engineering-related technical skills, I feel so drowned by the tedium.
12. I am much more of a strategic and high-level thinker and planner. In fact, cunning planning is the only reason I survived (and thrived at) my degree.
13. I don't mean this in a smug way. I praise and envy low-level tactical implementers. I wish I could do what they do without pulling my hair out and bashing my skull in the wall to get through the task.
14. A lot of my accomplishments were due to teamwork, I'd help other engineers with their weaknesses, and they help me with my technical deficiencies. That's how I look ""good on paper"". I'm a great 'marketer'.

**Part B:** Some of you will say: Change careers! Now here is where it gets messed up:

1. I got into a PhD program in Robotics at a decent school, straight from my undergrad (I had 3 publications).
2. If I hate this so much, why did I pursue a PhD? On one hand, I thought grad school would be less chaotic and would give me a chance to focus (Note: I was wrong).
3. On the other hand: I left my rotting country (where I am a bullied minority) via my PhD. It was a salvation ticket.
4. I am now faced with academic duties. The ones I am worried about most are courses and research. I can survive. But here lies the final problem:
5. I am stuck in my PhD (because quitting is not an option, and swapping specializations is impossible). I am really, really, immensely trying to get better at technical skills. I am trying to enjoy it. I just cannot. It's all forced.
6. I try learning something, I end up becoming squandered in 10 different directions. I also really hate ROS (the academic standard in Robotics). I abhor programming.
7. Recently I have decided to focus on MATLAB &amp; Simulink, because it seems less painful to me. However, reading technical documents, I have always struggled to absorb the information.
8. I force myself every day to sit in the lab and learn. But every day I waste tons of hours just calming myself down and not exploding while there.
9. I look at my classmates, everyone is having such a good time implementing, doing research at the lab. I look like I'm on crack and extremely out of place.

I am truly sorry for unloading, but I am in desperation. If anyone has insight or experience. Please. Help.

It's also very close to home, and so I don't have to pay any living expenses as I stay with my parents. 

Here comes the dilemma. One of the top medical device companies in the world has offered me a Quality Engineer position on a year contract. Being a contract position it will essentially pay me more than double my current salary, and I will be making more even after living costs. 

So my real question here is which of these options would be better for career development in my future? I am only 23, so the money of the contract job is very enticing. It's also working for a very well-known company and would look great on my resume. And of course there's the possibility of my contract being extended, or even being hired full-time down the road. One concern i did have was that its just Quality Engineering, which I may or may not like as I do not have very much experience in it. But I am sure I can move around after the contract role anyway. The smaller company will offer me the chance to have more diverse responsibilities of course. It may be better experience in that aspect? I am not really sure. It is also a very relaxed and laid back environment, whereas the contract job would likely be very cut-throat. But maybe it could be worth it to do contract work for a year or two to rack up some cash? I have no need for benefits at this current time anyway.

39,Cold Feet on FE (EIT) Examination Day. Should I just not take it?,1578106144,"I gave notice to my current employer that I was leaving today.  During my time there, the only foreseeable salary increase required taking the FE/EIT exam, as promised 3 and 6 month reviews never happened despite request.  I was mandated to register for it within the 3 month mark, so I did.

Between the NCEES fees, transcript fees, and board fees, I've already paid into this thing $386.  

If I take and pass the exam tomorrow, my local board requires a $52 payment to ""certify"" the scores and a $25 payment to get the board to sign it.  That's another $77, non-reimbursable.

The original salary increase was $2,500.   If I stayed, I'd have overall seen a salary increase of barely $2000.

But this is irrelevant since I already gave notice and my new role is administrative,non-engineering.  They don't care about an EIT, but they would care about a LeanSS or MBA.  My new employer's total compensation would amount to about 25% more than current.

I majored in Industrial Engineering as an undergrad where EITs and PEs are uncommon.  It was not vouched for during college by faculty and advisors, unlike for CivE's and MechE's.

**tl;dr:  I registered for the EIT exam and am scheduled to take it tomorrow.  But seeing that I have to pay more if I pass and that my new job and path completely negate it, should I still take it?**

46,Working a part-time fun job as a full-time engineer?,1578094425,"
Hi guys so in summary I am a full-time Civil Engineer I work 40 hour weeks and am thinking about taking up a part time photography gig. I am also super into photography and have used it as my side hustle through college to make some quick money by taking senior photos (my own business). I recently stopped doing senior photos due to not having time to edit and honestly being tired of all the logistics,time commitment, and people skills it took to run my own photography business. I recently found a company that hires people to do graduation ceremonies a few months a year (May-June, August, December) they do all the editing, equipment, and transportation costs. It is only 4-8 hrs a weekend and you get paid $125 a graduation (that’s like~ $30/hr). 

Basically my question is have any of you worked a part-time fun job while being a full time engineer? What was your experience, and was it worth the extra time commitment? I don’t necessarily need the money, but it could be a source of extra income and way to improve my photography skills.",AskEngineers,False,IntrepidPurple,/r/AskEngineers/comments/ejnt8v/working_a_parttime_fun_job_as_a_fulltime_engineer/
47,Remote starting diesel fire pump - please help an Aussie in the fires!,1578093445,"Hey folks,

We've been prepping the house all week here in East Gippsland, Victoria, in a likely naive attempt to stop it from burning in these fires. If you haven't seen it, they dwarf what happened earlier in the year in both the US and the Amazon. The fire front is currently about 3km away and today will be very bad fire conditions. 

If the house survives today, I want to help my elderly dad start the diesel pump remotely. The pump runs sprinklers on the roof and walls of the house - to stop embers igniting the building. Because water storage is finite, you can't just start the pump on any given day at any level of fire risk and leave the house - the water will run out before the fire comes through. Leave it too late though and you'll likely get stuck and in immediate, grave danger.

I want to be able to remotely start the pump by calling e.g. a prepaid mobile number. Yes I have googled this and yes I am sure I'm on a jihadi watch list now lol. I'm a moderately capable layperson with electronics but not an engineer and not able to design. I usually follow walkthroughs and have built things like a boominator stereo, some audio gear, and a 4.8kwh 24vdc off grid solar system.

We would also set up a webcam so we can see exactly when the embers start arriving from the fire front, and then use the remote start to kick off the motor/pump. I was thinking that we could hear the pump running via webcam to confirm that we've had a successful ignition, and to try again if required. Not elegant but perhaps would work? I am guessing there may be a better way to sense that the pump is running, by a voltage or motion or heat?

This whole thing would fall down when mobile towers have power outage, but as far as I see it's our best bet. Though could we also have a redundancy e.g. a thermal relay for a couple hundred degrees - so if it detects a temperature that can only be caused by fire, the pump will start anyway?

The diesel motor has a small electric starter motor on it, a standard car battery connected, plus a free-hanging cable we touch onto the positive to kick on the starter motor. I'm guessing something like a relay would be required here?

Thanks so much in advance and stay safe if you're in a bushfire area.

Hi all, I am looking for input on my project.

I'm looking for anyone who can answer my question(s). The topic is, I guess spring piston or perhaps it may be related to tension rods. I am looking for switches/locks/motion arresters, what ever they may be known as, to make my system have the motion/locking characteristics described below and illustrated in the Figure.

Only mechanical locking mechanisms or non-mechanical mechanisms that do not involve the input of external electrical energy or to make the lock/unlock mechanisms work.

In the figure at #1 there is a rod in a tube with a compression spring. A downward force (1) on the rod pushes the rod end against the compression spring and compresses it until it reaches a locking point as shown in the figure at #2. Then, when the force (1) released the system locks and the compression spring remains in its compressed state. When a subsequent downward force (2) exceeds the compression spring force, the system unlocks and the compression is allowed to decompress.

In the Figure at #3, it shows that now there is force (3) from the spring pushing the rod upward. As the rod is rising, it will encounter a significant stopping or downward force (4), at which point, the rod immediately stops/locks at the position where it encountered force (4) and will not move downward in spite of force (4). Then, when force (4) is released, force (5) pushes the rod up a bit unlocking the rod as shown in the Figure at #4.

How about if a relatively small amount of energy needs to be stored? Such as if spring-loaded Teslas were wound up at every intersection in a city.  While this may seem silly, can't springs take a lot more cycles than proper batteries? They can also be wound up with much more torque.

18,Can anyone help me attempt to save the world?,1577963002,"I am in the process of designing a (mostly) passive solar desalination system and need the help of a professional(s) to make it a reality. Considering the rise in global temperature, especially with the fires in Australia, I need help making this operational as fast as possible. And considering that I am a very good idea man and a very bad engineer, I am looking to anyone interested for their expertise. Note: I am not looking for free labor to help make a device that I will profit from. All I would like is credit if the idea is ever made and is successful. If it can somehow generate revenue using the waste from the system then I would appreciate some of the revenue, BUT the first intention is to use the idea to help the planet. There is potential to generate revenue from the waste product, but I have not fleshed that out as of yet.

Here is the most simple explanation of the system:

1) You use solar energy to pump sea water to a holding tank.

2) You pump sea water from the holding tank to a solar hot water ""pre-heater"" panel (search YouTube for solar hot water panel) that brings the water temp as high as possible prior to step 3.

3) This pre-heated sea water is then fed into a still that has a fresnel lens focused on it to enable high temp, flash boiling. The sea water is distilled into a fresh water tank. The still has three openings: SIDE HIGH-Input sea water, TOP-Output fresh water, OTHER SIDE LOW-Output brine waste. Side openings are controlled by valves. Valves are controlled by sensors detecting fluid level inside the still. Still will periodically go through a rinse cycle during which the valves will remain open for a extended period of time to flush the still and prevent salt deposits from forming and potentially clouding the still. The still volume is probably the most important aspect of making the system as efficient as it can be. The focal point of a fresnel lens will be the 1st determining factor for still size/volume. 2nd determining factor is the speed to boil and evaporate the seawater considering the focal point in relation to high temp generation.

4) Brine waste is sent to a recovery tank that separates the varying sized solids from the fluid. This tank should be situated above the sea water holding tank to allow gravity to feed the filtered fluid back to it for reuse. The separation of the brine solids will be accomplished by solid tilted screens that enables a clog free collection point. All screens will angle towards a central exit point. As the solids build up they will naturally fall into a collection container for removal when full.

5) You then use this fresh water through a water pipeline to inundate deserted areas with moisture in order to terraform them. By terraforming deserted areas with fresh water we can grow vegetation that can not only absorb carbon dioxide, but also save deserted areas from disastrous fires. More vegetation will also lower temperature in that area and lock in this moisture. Once a relatively small area near the site has been successfully terraformed you can then work on extending the pipeline by length and width further into the deserted area. Therefore the system must be designed to be scalable.

6) The portions of the system that require direct sunlight (solar panel, solar water heater and fresnel lens w/ still) will use a solar tracker for constant sun facing to keep efficiency as high as possible. Using a modular design, you would determine how many panels, stills and water heaters you could combine with 1 or 2 fairly large central holding tanks for each type of water and waste. Keeping in mind that the fresh water will be not remain at the site for an extended period of time instead being pumped out to the pipeline on an almost constant basis.

The goal of the system is to produce as much fresh water as possible and collect enough solar energy to pump it far enough to make it worthwhile. As far as you run the pipeline you will need to add solar panels along the way in order to power additional pumps to maintain pressure over a distance. Depending on the distance it may make more sense to install more holding tanks to maintain this pressure. The pipeline will be designed to enable as many branched pipelines as possible to extend the width of the reach of the system.

Thank you for reading if you made it this far. There so many more details, that I did not add for fear of making this a MUCH longer post, that I would love to discuss with those who are interested. Including the limitations and restrictions of the idea in regards to material choices, pump power requirements and pipeline volume capacity.

Let us unite to design and manufacture something good for the world!

P.S. I know some might ask as how to pay for such a system. I believe that there will be organizations willing to either build our design themselves or pay for us/someone to assemble it for them. This system defeats other desalination techniques in that there are no repeatable costs in order to produce the fresh water. It uses natural energy and does not use filter membranes. It will require maintenance (brine removal, general upkeep), but that is a drop in the bucket when compared to the costs associated with every other mainstream desalination method out there. Yes you will continue paying to extend the pipeline as needed, but the rewards of now having usable land (that, for instance, can now be farmed) compared to land that would otherwise be unusable will more than offset that cost once established. The system will be best used on coasts that are closest to deserted areas. Australia is the best candidate that comes to mind at the moment.",AskEngineers,False,MakeGoodBetter,/r/AskEngineers/comments/eiwwlh/can_anyone_help_me_attempt_to_save_the_world/

What I wanted to ask everyone was, do professors/colleagues/fellow students/other engineers look up to someone who admits they have other dreams and aspirations or would they end up feeling as if the person isn't cut out to be a good engineer. I am speaking from the perspective of a student. Along my journey I will end up meeting a lot of students and possibly professors with whom I will share my past. I was just confused as to how I would approach them. Do I mention how if I found a way to make it in music in the future, I'd drop my engineering job right away or do I refrain from talking about my passions at all and maintain an image of an efficient machine concerned only with its purpose to make other efficient machines.

I think most of you would recommend that I find a middle ground but I seriously can't put it into words. I don't like lying. I would probably tell them the truth about how music is my dream because I feel like I can make the biggest impact that way but then I would feel that I didn't clarify how serious I am about engineering and as a result would add in a statement like ""but I also really enjoy what I am doing and studying right now. I feel as if I enjoy it enough that if I had to do it for the rest of my life, I'd be happy and I'd be good at it."" I dunno still feels like I care too much about the music there or am I overthinking?

In celebration of NYE last night I was watching clips from NASA and SpaceXs Youtube channels, and I remember thinking how smart it was to have all the smoke from the rockets igniting be blown off to the side so we can actually see the rocket taking off.

I starting thinking about it and remembered the video of NASA testing firing an engine that made so much vapor clouds that it started to rain a few hours later.

The idea of steam and water vapor got me thinking about nuclear reactors using steam to turn a turbine to create electricity, and since rockets are creating huge amounts of steam from ignition, would it be safe to direct the steam towards a turbine?

Looking for some advice. I have been in the industry for 4 years since achieving my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering.  I recently passed my PE and plan to get a license (hope to work for a design firm part time on the side). But I feel like I want to pursue a PhD purely for learning aspect and being able to one day work in a lab with newer tech. I've had experience in power (~4yrs) and exposure to semiconductor industry (~4 months) and feel like I want to switch from manufacturing/electrical distribution as it's very process &amp; businesses driven where I feel like a cog just keeping the machine going vs working on developing something new in the industry. 

Now here's my issue:
Cons: I have no prior research experience. 
Pros: I've had 4yr industry and a EE bachelor's with 3.3GPA and just passed my PE exam.

Whats the best way to get my foot in the door for a PhD program far out of my industry? (Biomedical ece, ML&amp; controls, architecture/embedded systems) I've had some courses in these areas and really enjoyed delving into it in undergrad.

I have some top universities in my area I was thinking I can apply as a non-degree seeking student to take graduate level courses this year, review the professors research, and hopefully get some more exposure to the field and maybe get a research position. Or would it be ridiculous to email the professor asking for a weekend research position or something to get exposure &amp; LOR?

31,Electrical Engineer ( Advice on how to pick myself up),1577916343,"Happy New Year everyone,  


TL;DR: I messed up a lot in college, I got lucky and secured a manufacturing engineer position. Life and relationship dictate I need to move leaving this opportunity behind, and I want to irrefutably call myself an electrical engineer as it's all I've wanted since I started my first day at ITT.  Im looking for recommendations for what to do to achieve my goal, given my history.

 To start, I'd like to say that I failed. At a younger age, I was rushed into college, and I simply chose a college to get people off my back. Eventually, I'd end up leaving that college and going to ITT Technical Institute(the failure). I didn't know nor did I research the quality of the education that I'd receive, and I had grants and FAFSA to mostly cover my expenses. This naivete continued all the way until I graduated in 2013. I had no car at the time when I graduated and was working customer service, and continued until 2016 when I could buy my first car. I foolishly did not practice electronics during this time, and to be quite honest I could not afford a kit until the end of 2016, when I jumped from a shift lead for Walgreens, headfirst into electronics at another company.

Since then I have progressively moved forward through low paying tech positions until I achieved a manufacturing test engineer position (low paying of course) but with experience.  Unfortunately,  I  have to move by February  and my wife and I have chosen to move up north towards the Sacramento area to be near family. This is where I noticed my problem. I've applied to multiple companies  but received no interview opportunities. I ended up finding out about ITT's reputation and the value of the degree. On top of that, their Electrical Engineering program was not ABET accredited.  I've come to believe that I have made a dire mistake, and after coming to terms with it, I am trying to establish myself as an engineer in some way.  With the long story out of the way,  I'd like to know the opinions of any engineers about what steps they'd take in my shoes. I need a bit of guidance on how to fully educate myself and fill the holes in my knowledge.  Lastly, should I just look for technician positions? I've applied to a few, but I've had no luck. The one thing I do know is that I will not repeat the same mistake twice.

P.S.  As I understand it, the F.E exam is not an option for me either seeing as I did not attend a school with ABET accreditation.",AskEngineers,False,torey91,/r/AskEngineers/comments/eioks7/electrical_engineer_advice_on_how_to_pick_myself/

I'm looking to get more familiar with this topic as a hobby, but I'm finding it kind of difficult -

Courses I've found on kinematics are... about kinematics. While calculus and algebra haven't been much of a problem for me, and I didn't have much trouble grasping whatever basic Newtonian mechanics I've come across, I'm looking to go as fast as possible to building something before I start analyzing it. I don't mind doing some basic necessary math to figure out how many teeth I need or the angle of a bevel gear, but I don't want to get too far into the math and away from the practice.

&amp;#x200B;

Books I've found haven't been enough: ""507 mechanical movements"" is very lackluster in its explanations and contains many duplicates with slight modifications (not even side-by-side), and as entertaining as the the animated versions on the website are, I think there's more to learn that I can't get from those. ""Making things move"" is more focused on robotics, which, although interesting, is not what I'm aiming for right now.

Although this is r/AskEngineers, meaning you probably didn't take any shortcuts learning this (I only started studying computer science because I wanted to understand how computers work, but kept going even after I got a satisfactory answer - boolean algebra), I'm hoping you have some shortcut-y advice/material to offer rather than taking mathematical courses on kinematics.

38,Perspectives in automotive after graduation,1577896235,"Hello everybody,

as you can guess from the title, I'm a (soon-to-be) graduate in Automotive Engineering in Germany, presumably getting my degree within the next two weeks. I already know that I passed, just not the exact mark. It will be between 2.2 and 2.4, which should be around a 3.0 to 3.2 GPA (US) or a upper second-class honors (UK). Not perfect, but reasonably solid.

However, during my time in university, the whole automotive sector seems to have fallen into a coma. While there were some reasonable job offers for graduates beforehand, I can't find squat now. There are very few external job offers for experienced engineers and almost none for recent graduates. And those who exist often have ridiculous prerequisites that I can't even partly meet, in addition to almost always being far away from where I live now. Offers for inspection engineers (for mandatory inspections of vehicles) are sometimes open, but one of my cousins chose this path and he said it's not a great job. It feels almost overwhelming and as if I haven't learned anything useful.

I really wanted to get into motorsport and briefly joined our Formula SAE team, but the activity in my time there was very limited due to restructuring of the team between two cooperating universities. When the real work began, the coursework was too demanding to put time in it. Looking back, it is certainly a wasted opportunity. While there are some job offers from motorsport teams, all of them require some kind of related or even on-track experience, so that's likely not going to work out.

Another idea was engine application or testing (real-life or benching is less important), because I guess I'm decent with data acquisition and processing. Sadly, not a single offer within around 200 km (125 mi).

Moving is... well, maybe possible, but not easy. I'd rather stay where I am. Long story, please don't question it.

 

Now, where do I want to go? I really have no idea anymore. What are possible career paths with my degree? 

In around two weeks, I will start an internship at a software company, but I feel I'm not qualified for this kind of work, despite already having some experience with programming and two semesters of CS before I changed courses.

While I do have experience with programming, I hate to be reduced to being a coder. Something similar happened during my half-year internship at an OEM in 2018 where I started off with two weeks of coding because I was the only one who even remotely knew what to do.

Besides programming, I have worked on cars, bikes, in a machining shop and in a factory for automotive parts, know a bit about analog and digital communication and have at least basic CAD and datasheet reading knowledge. The latter two are very useful for 3D printing, another hobby of mine.

 

Can you help me? I guess some of you faced similar struggles after graduation, can you chip in your experiences?

If there's any information missing, just ask.

I'm a mechanical engineer (not an electrical engineer, but I do have some electrical knowledge, alongside all the computer engineering classes I've taken for my minor) that got an arduino for christmas, and one of the things I am trying to control with it is a high power solenoid-like device.  That aside, I need to basically make a big coil of wire to act as a giant solenoid so that I can get the maximum amount of magnetic field possible with up to 1000 watts.  My problem is, from the research I've done, it seems that its more about the overall mass of the solenoid rather than the gauge versus the number of turns of wire, but I'm trying to find the most optimal way for a beginner to make a big ass coil.  like 3 inches in diameter (half inch hole through it, I'll probably wrap it around a one inch diameter pipe or something) and like 4 inches long.  stacking a lot of the wire.  like 5-10 pounds of copper wire solenoid coil.  powerful.  What i'm trying to essentially get at here is that I need help designing this thing, particularly in terms of the wire gauge to choose for this.  I am not too worried about heat issues since it will only be used in very short pulses where a ton of current will be sent through the solenoid, but I have yet to find a concrete answer between low gauge wire, fewer turns, and lower voltage with higher current, and high gauge wire with more turns (i really dont want to make the coil out of high gauge copper wire by hand for this so i would prefer lower gauge wire, but this is why im asking for help here).

Also another thing: does wrapping he wire around a metal vs. PVC/plastic pipe make any difference in how strong the magnetic field (and thus the magnetic force it produces) is? 

please note I am currently concerned with designing the coil right now, I'll worry about the rest of the stuff I need for it like capacitors and such once I get it made.  I am currently not too concerned with cost either.

As I am having a hard time finding a custom sized cross-flow heat exchanger for my cold glycol, I am starting to consider Thermo Electric Cooler devices (Peltiers).

So if the weather is super hot I can only cool my drinks to weather temperature - 20 degrees.  

To me it didnt make much sense how the peltier would work this way, is there any math or studies that show this?

I'm wrapping up my first year in industry, and shit. Working as a manufacturing engineer in a high mix environment, things are always crazy here. I'm a manufacturing engineer/CAD monkey who reviews customer drawings and models and ensures they're manufacturable, conformant to the customer's specs.

Some relevant details about the shop:

\- ISO 9001, about a million a month in sales

\- No design, all customer spec'd

\- 2 manuf. engineers (self included)

\- 2 admins quoting, 2 admins deal with incoming POs (small company, many hats worn)

The thing that has really been driving me bonkers lately is that our management is not (systematically) requesting solid models when our customers submit orders. they need models to quote sheet metal parts, I really have no idea why this is happening. This means that (very often) I have to reach out to our customers' engineers and request models from them.

So I ask, for those of you who work at small-ish professional shops making things for other people:

\*\*How often do you have to reach out to the customer? Is what I have to do normal for someone in my position?\*\*

The direct result, aside from annoying our customers' engineers, is that my team can loose a couple days of lead time on our processing of the models. My job is to process the model, not get the model, right?

Since management won't support me, I wanted to get some feedback. Validation, if you will. I plan to send out e-mails to all our major buyers because I'm tired of this shit. I'm going to handle it.

let me quickly explain to you my educational background.

I did an 3 years Apprenticeship ( in germany our system is called ""Ausbildung"", which is like a dual study system college+working at a company). I did it in the field of CAD Design/Technical drawing. My company built the molds for injection molding (up to 40to). We worked with Catia V5 (company) and Simens NX (school). I liked the work but I wanted more and wanted to go more into designing the part for which we built the mold.

After those 3 years and half a year of fully working I quit and began to study mechanical engineering with the specialisation in form shaping/molding (dont know the exact englisch translation).

I do this in a dual study system. So instead of just having lecture at the university I also work at a company. This company is pretty big and has a lot of students. Due to the amount of students each student gets a different supervisor. My supervisor is located in the maintenance department. During my time at the company I get assigned to do some projects which my supervisor thinks are needed to be done. Sadly all my projects are about the infrastructure like: Gas, Water, Cooling systems, pressured air etc. I won't get any experience in CAD Design. I'll finish my bachelor by the end of 2020 and I'm looking forward to get a job in CAD Design again.

Along with a piece of string or something. So there's four things in my USB C cable. Which one should I hook it up. All the posts online tell me different things. And most importantly they all tell me to find the red wire. Well I don't have it. 

So basically my questions are;

First of all is it safe to try and charge my phone with 2 9 volts batteries?

and which cable should I hook which wire to.

I'm sorry if this is a silly question. Everything electrical isn't really my ballpark. I'm more of a software guy.

99,Looking for advice on whether or not the flange of a Copolymer Acetyl part can be machined to a 32RMS surface finish.,1577709421,"I'm designing an enclosure for an underwater vehicle (medium sized AUV) that needs to be constructed completely from thermoplastics, with the exceptions of the fasteners of course.

The enclosure is a large panel being used to house photovoltaic cells and sensors which is why the use a Acrylic is essential. 

I intend to use a Copolymer Acetyl as the main enclosure body with the top plate being made of Cast Acrylic. The two parts will mate along a flange secured by SS fasteners. 

I originally planned on using a Homopolymer Acetyl like Delrin for it's stuctural properties and machineabily but am opting for the use of a Copolymer Acetyl out of concern of centerline porosity issues from the machining process.

I am currently planning on using either a dual O-ring seal along the flange or the combination of a recessed thermoset/thermoplastic elastomer gasket alongside an oring.

There are other aluminum and SS parts of the AUV which I have specified the sealing surfaces to 32RMS. 

My question is, is it realistic or possible to acheive a 32RMS surface finish between the Copolymer Acetyl and the Acylic?

The seal needs to withstand a maximum of 1100psi in its intended use case.

I am currently a mechanical engineering student and this is personal project so I have no immediate restraints.
