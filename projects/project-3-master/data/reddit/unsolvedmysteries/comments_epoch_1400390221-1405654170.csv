3,"After graduating last spring I've finally landed myself a great job, this means I have to quit my internship of 15 months, I want to give them a gift but have no ideas?",1405643736,"Hello all!

I have recently completed a dual bachelor's in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (my school is old school and hasn't started using the term ""mechatronics"" yet).  I started an internship in April 2013 that was only supposed to last 6 months but they kept telling me they needed me and my ""good work"" and ""good attitude"" longer.  I stuck around after graduation in May because there was a hint of a full time position opening for me but I guess with budgets the way they are they just can't bring anyone else on.  I began my search for a job and landed two jobs, one good, the other great.  I took the great option and have notified the people at my internship that I'll be resigning.

4,Hypothetical: What would it take for a schmo like me to get a satellite into orbit?,1405634684,"Project: Get an optical telescope into some Earth orbit that would be useful for taking pretty pictures of stars and stuff.

I want it to stay up there for several weeks, if not months or years. I want to be able to communicate with it to point it in different directions. I want it send pictures down to me on Earth. What would it take for me to do this?

I'm speaking hypothetically, of course. I picked an optical telescope because sometimes I'm an amateur astronomer. But I'd like to keep this generalized. I'm not actually considering this. I'm just wondering what level of knowledge and funding and materials it takes. I read about people launching high-altitude balloons and model rockets and things. Also ham radio people get satellites up there sometimes by hitching a ride with other launches. It makes me curious what people outside of NASA, SpaceX, and defense contractors could be capable of.

Assume I have all the money necessary.

* **How much money would it take?** Tens of thousands, millions, billions?

* **Can the materials needed for this be bought by just anyone?** Especially the fuel. Do you need a clean room and advanced manufacturing processes to have a chance, or can you build it in your garage?

* **Could I hire people to work on this?** Is there a market of aerospace engineers that can be hired and would be able to do this? Is technology at a point where hobbyists can consider this?

* **Or could my friends do this?** Suppose me and my friends aren't professional engineers but do semi-relevant hobbyist stuff: astrophotography, electronics, ham radio, model rockets, etc. (This isn't me, and I don't have these friends).

* **Are there regulations on putting objects into orbit?** Beyond interfering with the FAA's domain.

* If this is all crazy, **how long until something like this could be feasible?** And if part of this is possible for me, which parts?

Note: I'm assuming this is a ridiculous notion. But I don't have any idea *how* ridiculous it is.",AskEngineers,LogicalTom,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2azsg9/hypothetical_what_would_it_take_for_a_schmo_like/

6,Need help to somehow connect roofing brackets,1405627177,"So I have a very strange problem,


I am working for a professor at my university for the summer. We are building a water loop for research purposes. Part of this loop includes a very large globe valve which sits horizontally (about 35 inches length). What this means is we need a way to support the globe valve.


My suggestion was just to build a simple support of two plates connected by bolts that could be adjusted to go up or down easily. However a previous student had the professor buy a bunch of these ""roofing brackets"" and the Professor is absolutely adamant about using these roofing brackets to support this globe valve. He likes that they can be easily adjusted and have been approved by some quality control team.


So he wants me to somehow use two of them in tandem and create a ""bridge"" the globe valve can sit on while still being able to adjust the height of the roofing brackets. Which sounds easy until I sat down to draw something out to connect them and realized how difficult it is. If I bolt or weld the two tops of the roofing brackets together it removes all degrees of freedom and you cannot adjust the roofing brackets height by changing their angle... not without either stretching or compressing the metal between them at any rate.

Here is a very simple diagram I threw together (the exact same roofing brackets are being used):
 
http://i.imgur.com/smva7Mh.png


I was wondering about using curved bolts on one end that can be loosened when you want to adjust the height. Because to adjust the roofing bracket height you must adjust the angle which causes a lot of the problems. However this idea does seem sort of hokey to me.

I am wondering if /r/askengineers has any ideas or experience with this sort of problem before. 

tl;dr I need to connect the two roofing brackets without sacrificing freedom of movement (up and down) of the bridge between them.",AskEngineers,KingofRiders,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2azf3u/need_help_to_somehow_connect_roofing_brackets/
7,DC Servo Motor Under Impulse Load,1405621845,"So I'm trying to spec a DC servo motor for continuous position control, and it will be subjected to impulse loads while positioning.

I am a mechanical engineer by trade, but I need someone with more experience with electric motors to answer this question. The motor will drive a ball screw type linear actuator for the positioning, and I have run all necessary calculations to determine what torque the motor will have to resist to maintain its position. My issue is that most motors are rated with a stall torque, such that if it is running at a given rotational speed, it will stop when working against a torque equal to or greater than the stall torque.

My question is, if the motor isn't running continuously at a given rotational speed, but has power applied to it for positioning (very small movements), how can I determine if that motor will resist the torque applied from the impulse load on the actuator?

If you have any questions or need more information let me know. I can't decide if I'm over-simplifying or over-complicating. Part of me wants to believe that if power is applied, then the motor resisting motion until the stall torque is imparted in it is valid, but then I second guess that, thinking that inertia of a moving motor has to play into torque resistance.

I'm about to start my junior year at an ABET accredited engineering school.  I've chosen to major in bioengineering and this up coming semester I'll be starting to get into the meat of my major classes.  However, I am having a problem convincing myself that bioengineering is the right major for me. However, I am reluctant to change majors because I have worked very hard to be accepted into the bioengineering program.  

My schools bioe program is not specifically biomedical engineering like most programs are.  There is a biomed track that people can pursue.  I am going to pursue the biological track because I want to work on making things more environmentally friendly.  Though after some research online it seems like the only jobs there are for bioengineers are in the biomedical field.

I'm not sure that bioe is the best major for me.  If I switch majors now it will put me very behind schedule in regards to graduating on time.  Should I just stick bioengineering out for the last two years and if I can't get a job doing what I want go to grad school for either CHEMe or Civil/Environmental?

All of my friends and family say that I shouldn't worry and that if I graduate with bioe I will be fine.  They also attribute a lot of my fear to the fact that bioengineering is still a fairly new field and because of this it's hard to find info on.

What do you think? Will I be able to get a good job doing environmental type work with bioengineering? Will I even be able to get a good paying job?  Do you think bioengineering is even worth finishing?

17,"Marine Engineering cadet (Canadian) seeking/needing help and/or advice. (x-post MechanicalEngineering, engineering, AskEngineers, Ships, Nautical, Canada)",1405587364,"*This is directed towards fellow Marine Engineers, but if you can help and/or have advice, regardless of your background, it is all appreciated! Though, it should obviously relate to this post’s topic.*

I’m a 29 year old, male Marine Engineering cadet wrapping up my 2nd year academic term, followed immediately by a 6 month coop term to work aboard vessels to earn sea time and experience. In the previous coop term, a series of wonderful personal events (/s) prevented me from travelling to a ship as soon as I finished the 1st academic term (*physical injury, family death*).

As soon as I was ready to go and after much pestering of the coop coordinator, I was sent to a tanker on the Great Lakes. But this was only possible because a couple of my classmates came home which in turn opened a spot for me. Hooray! Experience!

Unfortunately I was only able to accrue a little over a month of sea time before the vessel tied up for layup; this became a problem. This became a problem because Transport Canada, the federal department that mandates our training program, requires us to have a minimum of 6 months of sea time to be eligible to write and receive our 4th Class Watchkeeper’s Certificate. This sea time is at the discretion of an individual that reviews our documents and so we must have much more than 6 months in case that individual, or Transport Canada, decides that a portion of your sea time isn’t eligible for whatever reason.

Another problems stemming from this is that our sea testimonials must state our rank as “Engine Cadet” to count towards cadet sea time; any other position is not accepted by Transport Canada. If I submitted a testimonial stating my hired position as an “Oiler”, I then owe another 6 months of sea time on top what already would have been submitted (*12 months total*) before being allowed to write the exam.

The other downside… I’m not allowed to pass into the 4th academic year without the 4th Class Watchkeeper’s Certificate. Mucho stress.

To summarize… the academic term is coming to an end and I have no leads for cadet opportunities. I haven’t received a single response from companies contacted and the Canadian Coast Guard can only hire me as an Oiler. Adding to this frustration and stress, is that our school coop coordinator hasn’t heard anything from the companies either.

Is there anything that can be done to improve or change this situation? Is there any company or person I could contact regarding engineering cadet opportunities aboard a vessel?

I’ve got 6 months to work and no where to go. Help, leads, direction, advice… all of it, is greatly appreciated!

I've googled like crazy and cant find what im looking for and have started thinking about a approach using machine vision to do the same task but the projected measure seems so much more simplistic. I could buy a off the shelf projector and simply make the image I want to produce but I would prefer if it was a purpose built item rather than making due with something else. Thanks Reddit!

With regard to my resume, there's a computer program that I've learned a little bit about on my own but I don't have any formal training in. The position I'm most interested in I found lists this program as a ""desired skill"". Should I go ahead and put it on my resume?

This person is pretty high up at this company and could be a great asset to landing an amazing job if I play my cards right. Is there anything else I should include in my response to his email? Should I express how interested I am in his company? This is exactly the field I want to be in and I think my passion could potentially be a good selling point.

I want to drill a hole into the side of the repair clamp and the pipe, that way I can slide the clamp over the hole when not needed to seal it, and rotate the clamp 90˚ to access the hole. 

***Please don't suggest a better way to do it because that's not the point of my question.***

My question is: Would tightening the clamp around the PVC cause too much strain on the section with the hole? 

The hole will be 4.5"" in diameter, right in the center of the clamp. The clamp is about 0.024 inches thick. and at the two skinniest points next to the hole, it will be 0.75"" wide. The 0.2% yield strength for the 304 stainless steel is 205 MPa. 

So the clamp has two bolts that we can tighten, and the plan was to get a torque wrench, but we don't know how much applied torque would equate to the amount of tension force of the area at the thinnest point. How can I make the connection? I know Torque = force • distance. But I don't know what distance to use.

The frost build up is inside the plant located on and around the seams of the door.

They first had a fiberglass door there but had problems with warping due to the sun and switched over to a steel door. This is when the frost build up became an issue. Due to the cleaning procedures, the relative humidity in the plant is pretty high, and dehumidifying the area is not really an option.

My supervisor recommended mounting a fan so that it was blowing on the inside of the door, but I am not sure how this would help the situation. My understanding of condensation is that it is dependent on relative humidity and temperature difference.

* ""If they'd just increase that flow, erosion would stop!""
* ""There's no way a huge I-beam on a bridge bends, it's either straight or broken.  There's no other options.""

____________________________________________________________________________________________


The purpose of the Solar Collector (SC) is to treat biosolids.  This project is to amend another that uses Anaerobic Digestion (AD) to treat human waste in a developing area.  The community in question has a parasite infection and the AD conditions alone are not harsh enough to kill the parasite and keep it from reproducing.  

That is where the SC comes into play.  The digested biosolids from the AD reactor will then be treated in a second stage with high temperatures (50 Celsius and up) in the SC to kill the parasite.  Undigested WasteWater (WW) may also be added to the SC to aid in treatment.

I am not an engineer and am willing to take any suggestions that would improve this project.  The idea is to create a simple prototype with cheap, easily found materials.  The proposed model I have now utilizes a 55gallon drum (open at one end with a lid and drum ring to close it) elevated on a frame, with reflectors placed in a ‘V’ below it.  It will load about 20gal of mixed biosolids and WW, inclined at one end to prevent spillage.  My biggest issue right now is how to load/unload it.

I have contacted contractors to procure a reflective hardboard material.  If that does not pan out, I will try to find a couple flat sheets of aluminum or adhere Mylar film to a surface.  

My engineer friend is helping me with the design, but I would greatly appreciate any input.

86,How deep should deposits from sediments from excavation of a canal be? Are there any guidelines? Please help! It's for science!!,1405272651,"Hi Engineers --

I'm just a dumb ecologist but I'm working on a paper that is investigating the potential environmental impact of the construction of the Nicaraguan canal. It is a very basic ""if the canal is this wide, XX hectares of forest will be removed"" type paper. 

Based on stated min and max canal widths (230-520 m) and depths (28-30 m), I am attempting to look at various scenarios for the basic footprint of the canal. The developers claim that soil excavated from the canal construction will be deposited along the canal route to create 158 km2 of ""new agricultural area"". 

My calculations suggest that depending on the mean width of the canal, such deposits would have to have a depth of between 10-20 m, which seems like a lot to me. But like I said, I'm not an engineer. Does anyone know of any published work or guidelines on how deep deposits from such excavations should/could be? Or depth of sediment deposits from construction of other canals?

One of his points is that all of the weight of a wind turbine propeller ends up on the lower half of the bearing and therefore the bearings are wearing out in 5 years instead of 20 making the whole thing cost prohibitive.  I saw the logic in this since wind turbine blades must be quite heavy.  However, I didn't think that a bunch of masters level aeronautical and mechanical engineers would forget that gravity pulls down and there must be a solution.  Or, is this really a problem?

91,Why don't high speed trains use a wheeled-third-rail instead of pantographs?,1405262323,"The best locomotives use externally-provided electricity to generate traction, because not having to haul a diesel engine anywhere significantly reduces the car's weight, leading to much greater power/weight and power/size ratios. The problem then is how to acquire that externally-generated electricity. 

The two main systems nowadays are ""third rail"" and ""pantograph""; the former is a third length of metal parallel to the running rails, and some sort of contact shoe is dragged along this rail, providing the connection required to close the ""circuit"" and providing power. The latter has an electrified wire hung over the tracks, against which another sort of metal contact is also dragged, closing the circuit similarly.

The advantage of the third rail is that it's much easier to install and maintain -- adding a third rail is very easy if the first two are already in place. It's disadvantage is that the surface area of the shoe/rail contact is very large, creating substantial friction and wear at anything higher than highway speeds. As such, third rail systems are common in mass transit systems, but no where else.

The advantage of the pantograph system is that the pantograph-wire contact area is very small, creating minimal friction and wear, and thus allowing speeds up to thrice that of highways. The disadvantage is installation and maintenance of the overhead wire: it requires a support system, typically trackside poles every so often, which are more expensive than a third rail to install; and perhaps more importantly, the contact wire must be very high tensioned (tension increasing with speed), and maintaining very high tension over very long distances must be a time-and-money consuming process.

So, it seems to me that the infrastructure required for power provided at the height of the running rails is substantially less, and thus substantially cheaper, especially for long distance routes. Why then isn't there some system with such low power, and yet without the massive contact area of a traditional third rail? Such a thing could be a wheeled-third-rail, or maybe a third rail much thinner than running rails, whose top edge has the same size as the wire -- then a pantograph-like contact bar could be fit under the train, providing the same contact area as pantograph-wire, except installation and maintenance costs would be substantially lower.

Clearly though, if such a solution existed it would already be implemented, so what am I missing?",AskEngineers,Bunslow,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2al3k8/why_dont_high_speed_trains_use_a_wheeledthirdrail/

Greetings engineering type peoples. Hope this is the right place to be asking this, but I'd be interested in more educated input for curiosities sake.

I'm no engineer, I'm a programmer and the other day I was having a discussion with my boss regarding the various shortfalls of current VR immersion in computing. One feature we both agreed was missing from most systems was actual motion, and with the example scenario of a space simulator game we started talking about the practicality of building a powered chair with full rotational freedom. So we now get to where I'm curious for input from more knowledgeable folk.

Lets just assume that the computer part of this is a non-issue and doesn't effect the rotating chair system in any way (besides weight, but I think this is far too much of a surface curiosity to start doing calculations). Could you even create a multiple ring contraption that was powered and precisely controllable? I've seen powered gyro-chair rides but I get the impression that they are more of a ""spin it up and then leave it to its own"" sort of deal. A system like the one we were imagining would need to have the ability to control the rotation on each axis, and rotate continuously on any axis (not reach a limit and have to go back the other way). Is that even possible from an engineering standpoint? 

If so, how would the inner motors be powered? Neither of us know enough about this field to work out for sure how you would pass power from an outer ring to an inner ring, the best I could think of was a conductive plate that passes the power through as wires would only twist so far and eventually become a limiting factor.

(Semi-Serious),1405049818,"I've noticed more discussions about the F-35 popping up on reddit lately discussing the problems that have occurred during the aircraft's development, the pros and cons of decisions that were made during the craft's design, and so on. We even had a hearty discussion about it yesterday in this forum.

So, how would you have done it? Given the same resources and time, what would your F-35 look like?

1. How would you define the specific role and performance needs of the aircraft?

2. What aircraft would you actually produce? What features will it have or forego? How will you innovate in development, manufacturing, and future maintenance? How will you use it?

3. How do you sell this as a viable competitor or even a superior replacement for the F-35?

Note: I'm not a hater or apologist of the F-35. I'd just like to use this as a reason to get some productive discussion going about an interesting engineering challenge.

22,"Need career path advice. With my non-traditional education background, is environmental or chemical engineering more suitable for me?",1405035399,"Looking to do an online masters in engineering;  I'm torn between pursuing environmental or chemical.  I'd be happy in either, but I'd like advice on which would be more possible and/or have better job prospects.

I live in Baton Rouge, LA.  There are a lot of petrochemical plants and refineries nearby.  

I have a bachelors in Biology with minors in Chemistry and Psychology.

I received a Masters in Biology in 2011.  For the past 3 years (2011 - present), I've had an extremely hard time in the job market.  I've been unemployed for a while, I worked several minimum wage jobs (retail and t-shirt printing).  For about a year now, I've been working for my state's Department of Environmental Quality.

Since I have some environmental experience (air permitting, air enforcement), I decided I could go for a masters in environmental engineering and my experience would help me out.

However, in browsing for jobs over the past few months, I am seeing much more chemical engineering openings than environmental.  I'm terrified of screwing myself over again by pigeonholing my studies into something that doesn't have a lot of job prospects (My MS in biology has gotten me nowhere, even though I've applied to innumerable jobs).

Since my biology degrees only brought me to Calc 2, I'm currently taking Calculus 3 online and I'll follow up with Differential Equations, since nearly every engineering program requires these courses.

I'm planning on doing a fully online MS in engineering since I have to work full time to support my family (I know this isn't ideal, but it's all I can manage).  

Here are my questions that I hope this subreddit can help me with:

Am I correct to assume that chemical engineers have better opportunities/prospects than environmental?

I'm not a pushover when it comes to coursework (My science GPA was a 4.0 [I only made a B in English and a B in literature]), but is a chemical engineering masters possible for me (I haven't had Pchem, thermo, and other typical engineering classes).  Looking at the coursework, it looks like chemical would be more difficult for me personally, since the classes look like extensions of classes you'd take as an undergrad in ChemE.  Environmental seems to be it's own separate field where most of the classes are stand-alone (I hope wording it this way makes sense).

I am already in contact with an environmental engineering program, it sounds like once I finish these maths, I have a really good chance of being accepted.  Will it be harder for me to get into a chemical engineering program?

What would you advise I do?  I'd be happy in either field, I just really want a job.

30,"An engineering question or two regarding large space launch platforms (Saturn V, R7, etc.).",1404999769,"I've read a *lot* of material on all manner space vehicles, but I keep coming back to this one question.

  
When a large vehicle like the Saturn V, or the Russian R7 is assembled and erected (or the other way around), there must be an enormous amount of stress placed on whatever internal frame structure the rocket uses. Cranes and other supporting hardware has to be attached somewhere (like the A-frame shaped members that attached the STS to it's fuel tank).

  
How are these stresses managed and controlled during the critical periods before and after launch?  

What sort of fittings and fasteners are used to keep the stages of these colossal machines together?  

  
Superficially, it seems absurd that the entire weight of a Saturn V or Delta IV could rest stably on a structure small enough to give clearance for the engines. It is obviously not *that* absurd, though, because it is a solved problem (much like any skyscraper or suspension bridge).

  
For instance, when looking at old photographs from the assembly of one of the Saturn Vs (one of the upper stages, the S-IVB), there doesn't seem to be much hardware on either inside or outside of the inter-stage to take the weight - what is stopping the several-hundred-tons of upper staging from ripping off during ascent?

I worked as a Front End HW engineer for one of the largest semi conductor companies for 10 years. I left to start my own small business in another field 4.5 years ago. Haven't coded a single line since then.

Now I'm itching to get back into engineering. I live in SF and thinking about switching to SW engineering.

Why SW? Well even though I was a HW engineer, in my previous HW engineer job we would pretty much develop the environment to test the software model of the chip, write test plans/tests, debug regressions and try to find bugs. Bugs are either a RTL bug or environment bug. I'd say 80% of the job was SW engineering.

How hard do you think the transition and job finding would be?

In the past owned full environments for the very important chips, down the line the projects got bigger, owned many parts of the environment for the development and testing teams to use. Usually there was some base code already in these environments from our reuse methodology.

Started w/ PERL, last 5 years it was mostly C++. Most of this was w/o opening a single book.

I'm also thinking of taking some online classes in Java, Android and a few others prolly through pluralsight.

All money costs aside, obviously! *(to add to the title)*

I'm sure this has been thought of before by NASA and the likes.

But what if we slowly took all the parts needed for a spacecraft (pre-assembled on earth) and then re-assembled them at a space station in Earth's orbit, and then launched it to another planet?

Considering the massive amount of energy and parts wasted to get away from Earth's gravity to get into orbit-- this would give us a tremendous amount of energy and mass to deal with for the actual trek into empty space.

And yes, I realize it would be very expensive to constantly launch a series of parts into an orbital space station to assemble this spacecraft. But it's not about cost, it's more about what's going to get us farther into space and with more stuff to use once we actually get there.

Just consider- if we didn't have to worry about getting off of Earth and instead started from orbit, that would significantly reduce the amount of parts and energy we wasted getting off Earth to go to other worlds.

39,Need help finding resources to design a long rotating drive shaft that won’t flop around (x-post from r/engineering),1404934386,"I posted this in /r/engineering but this might be the better spot to get input...


I’m trying to find the proper analysis to determine how stable a rotating driveshaft will be (i.e. how to design one with minimal radial displacement). I’m not well versed in this area so I’m having trouble figuring out buzzwords and such to find introductory resources. 

The [basic system I’m working on]( http://i.imgur.com/q0Q529P.png) consists of a long rigid shaft rotating in a viscous fluid up to ~35 kRPM. The shaft is constrained at one end by a stiff bearing and the distal end is unconstrained. I kluged a prototype but the shaft is pretty wimpy and quickly starts whipping around at higher rotation rates (shaft diameter = 0.04”, length = 1 ft). My thought is that a thicker shaft will be more stable, so I’m trying to figure out how to approach scaling up the shaft diameter analytically (need to keep length constant). Since it’s rotating in a viscous fluid I assume there will be some dampening effect on shaft vibration, which I’d also like to account for. For shaft material considerations stainless is most practical, and the shaft can be solid or hollow (not sure how the weight/stiffness trade off of a hollow shaft would affect stability, but I figure it’s at least worth mentioning since the shaft length≫diameter). 

Any and all guidance is appreciated‼

I want to power three heating elements with the transformer. Each element connected between line and neutral. Each element has its own power controller. Making it possible to regulate the power to the elements independently from each other. Therefore I will have unbalanced loads on the secondary side.

Wiring: Primary Side

I have a 5 wire cable coming in. 3P(hase) + N(eutral) + E(arth). I know the three phases connect directly to the connectors on the transformer. I guess the earth will connect to the chassis of the transformer? What do I do with the neutral wire?

Wiring: Secondary Side.

I connect each heating element between phase and neutral. The loads on the secondary side will be unbalanced. Do I leave the neutral unconnected to anything (floating?) or do I ground the neutral? I've spent a little time on the internet trying to figure this out. As far as I can understand it is better to ground the neutral since it will ensure a stable voltage between line and neutral. And it will be safer. Not sure if this is correct? If I ground neutral, how do I do this?

During the jury selection process, both the defense and prosecution lawyers asked all of the prospective jurors what their occupation was.  This is normal and the people with connections to law enforcement and people intertwined with the offense that was being tried were excused.  

The strange part was an explanation that the evidence would involve physics and math formulas.  All of the engineers (four of us) were grilled on whether we understood basic physics (yes), whether we used math formulas in our work (yes), and whether we derived our own formulas for problems (sometimes).  We were all then excused.  

All I can assume from this is that neither the prosecution nor the defense wanted someone that could evaluate the truthfulness or accuracy of their expert witness.  More likely, they wanted sheeple that would instead be swayed by their arguments instead.

I do not know the specifics of our backup power generator, but I am curious nonetheless. When a loss of power is noticed our generator will kick on via an ATS. I was under the impression our generator was decommissioned, but soon after the event I'm about to share with everyone I realized that it was not. Anyway, I came back onsite for the power loss to help with our control system. The manager of the area was curious why the generator hadn't kicked on. I didn't think anything of it because I thought it wasn't in use, but he explained it was. He proceeded to kick the generator on and power to the correct areas was restored. Great. Now I need to preface this by saying I'm a ChE so I know enough about electrical work to get myself in trouble. I also know not to touch something I don't fully understand that can impact items worth many times my salary. After the following next two days maintenance shuts down the generator to change the oil and let it cool down. Production has been down this whole time, no equipment issues have been noticed, and nothing has been called to run. They switch off the breakers to the equipment it powers and shut it down. No more than 30 seconds later a VSD that was powered by the generator violently catches on fire. After all is said and done the electrician finds that almost every VSD and motor starter are completely shot in this building. Several peripheral PLC's are not starting up and other odd electrical issues are occurring as well. The electrician feels the generator did not kick on because we had about 1.5 good legs of power and the system may have been monitoring the good leg, or all three legs had just enough juice to keep it from activating the generator and switch. 

Could it be possible that we were backfeeding our system? Would that mean the equipment would be seeing 1 phase from the utility and 3 phases from the generator? Once the generator was off we began single phasing the equipment again. 

I can only guess we were backfeeding the building because I noticed, shortly before the fire, fans were slowly running in areas not connected to the generator. We did not have this issue with similar equipment in other buildings where power was lost and no generators are present. It is pretty odd to me and I'm mainly interested in general insight as to what can happen when someone backfeeds by mistake, and what damage if any that can cause to equipment.

My knowledge of reinforcement of banks, riverbeds and such are limited to inland use, I know the use of plants, bushes, trees help in stabilising the land and also on steep banks the use of gabions, sheet piles and mesh/mats filled with gravel or soil can help keep banks for collapsing and sliding. 

Would there be a way of implementing such technologies into protecting the coasts from further damage and further loss of land? ",AskEngineers,StGe,/r/AskEngineers/comments/29y0do/is_there_a_way_to_limit_or_control_coastal_erosion/

95,Question,1404595637,"Hello community. About a year ago I made a post on Ask Science regarding Material Science (for inventions). They asked me to move the post to Ask Engineers. I was glad that I did that. When I made the post I was given references to college text books for material science. I found them at my library and have been reading quite a bit. I will admit to not fully understanding it but, I feel that I have enough of an understanding to know where to look.

Despite knowing where to look, I have been having issues. The materials I found that would work are banned materials, or there is little to no information on the materials on the internet due to company privacy or something. That is why I came here to ask a few questions.

My first question being is there a way I can use the banned materials for prototype testing (not necessarily use it for the product)?

I noticed Aluminum mixed with Nickel has the strength for some of the parts. Several websites said that you have to use high grade aluminum for the bonding to work. Is this correct?

My last question is there any companies, or a way I can ask college students for help (consultation type of stuff) with the research, and the drawing portion of the Patent Office? If so how do I go about doing this? 

The reason I ask is because the few companies I tried here in Texas never gave me a response back. I am guessing they don't do individual projects. Who knows. 

Regardless any further information will help me with my project greatly. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read, and post. Thank you.

96,Is my sous-vide thermal model reasonable?,1404574196,"I've been experimenting with sous-vide cooking lately. For those of you uninitiated, it's basically the process of heating food in hot water. I've been trying to use Newton's Law of Cooling twice over to create a steak-water-air model.

Here is the [model](http://i.imgur.com/H357YYK.png) I created, based on using Newton's law of cooling twice over. Each line is the temperature of the steak over time for a given initial water temperature (lowest line represents an initial water temperature of 130ºF, increments of 5ºF moving up). This model assumes that I have enough water mass such that the room-temperature steak's affect on the temperature of the water is negligible.

I made a few measurements to get the coefficient of cooling for my cooler. I filled the cooler with 138.5ºF water (this is what I anticipated would be roughly typical initial water temperature) and waited 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the water temperature had fallen to 133.5ºF. The ambient temperature of the room was 75.8ºF. This gives a coefficient of cooling of 0.00554. I did a similar procedure when actually cooking a steak (the first 15 minutes of cooking) and the water cooled by 5.4ºF, rather than 5ºF.

Now, for the steak, I used a method that might be wildly inaccurate. My main curiosity is if the general idea of the model will hold up, not necessarily if my coefficients are currently accurate (though I think the one for my cooler is). I acquired the coefficient of cooling for the steak by consulting a recipe. According to the recipe, you bring the steak to room temperature and then it requires 45 minutes in the water bath to come to equilibrium. I made the assumption that the steak actually comes up to 5 degrees under the temperature of the water. Ultimately, I got a coefficient of 0.05522 - this is probably pretty inaccurate.

So my question is: am I way off base with all of this or should this work reasonably well (once I fine-tune the steak coefficient)?

I'm curious if anyone has tried to make something like corrugated cardboard type designed metal sheets. You could use a press to take a  sheet and smash it with tiny grooves that are super tiny and then layer metal on top and then use heat to fuse it to the ridges produced. I'm also curious if using a design that uses more of a divet type design instead of corrugations would work better. I'm thinking that using a divet format would end with issues because of heat causing the air spaces to pop and cause issues when fusing the layers on top. I'm also curious that if using a divet format would work if the divet bottom parts would have tiny holes poked in it to let the air pressure out.

1,Need job interview rejection advice,1404490538,"I went on two jobs interviews this month, and I've been rejected from both.  I passed the phone interview stage for each, which is usually the case for me. I did not pass the in-person interview.  I've had other similar rejections over the pass six months, and I'm starting to get concerned that I'm not interviewing right, or that something is wrong with my career, or me!

In both interviews, I got the feeling that the person they were really looking for was more specific than what they were advertising.  They wanted an expert in X, meanwhile their ad was for someone with broad skills in WXYZ.  I could see the look of disappointment on some of the interviewers' faces.

I'm also starting to get the cynical attitude that interviews are just to see if the employees can be friends with me - like joining a high school clique.  I don't think I schmoozed with my interviewers as much as I should -  ""where do you live, whats your background, etc.""  I just focused on the job at hand, and I came off as boring.

I'm trying to figure out what has been going wrong. What are some clues should I be looking for?

Edit:  I should mention that I've been actively working as an EE for the past 10 years.  I'm not straight out of school.

3,Boundary Layer Cooling,1404464335,"So I just started some work on impinging jets, and I'm having some trouble on understanding how effective any such kind of cooling can be if there's a boundary layer sitting between the target and the fluid.

My understanding is that fluid-based cooling relies on passing a large quantity of cold fluid over the hot target. This leads to heat being transferred via conduction to the fluid, which is being constantly carried away. Apparently there's also a level of convection to impinging jets, but I'm not sure about how that would work. 

But with a boundary layer sticking to the target and only moving at ~1% of the velocity of upper layers, how can rapid heat transfer take place? Is it the case that the boundary layer simply heats up to a similar temperature to the target, with the upper layers carrying heat away? Would the aim of the game then be to either turbulate the boundary layer, or to make it as thin as possible?",AskEngineers,Earl_Exosock,/r/AskEngineers/comments/29tbvs/boundary_layer_cooling/

9,I have a 9cm sphere that weighs 45g mounted on a small DC motor - How do I calculate how much torque my motor needs to turn it?,1404443443,"The motor I've selected is a small 5v dc gear motor rated for 2kg*cm stall torque.

I understand that if I were to have a lever with a weight on it, the longer the lever is, the more force the motor would need to lift the object, but in this case, it's not a weight at the end of a lever, nor is it even the weight of the lever itself that the motor needs to lift.  Since the weight is evenly distributed around the shaft, it seems like more of a question of how much force is required to get that mass moving, and how fast I want to get it up to speed, than a calculation involving the diameter, so I don't know how to apply the kg*cm rating here.

This is for an art piece, so the object doesn't need to spin up super fast.  If it took as long as a second to get up to speed, that should be acceptable.  

The object is so light that I really don't think I even need to worry about the torque, but I'm just interested to know how I should go about calculating it because two motor manufacturers asked me what torque I needed when I ordered the motor and I didn't have an answer for them.",AskEngineers,scswift,/r/AskEngineers/comments/29sq26/i_have_a_9cm_sphere_that_weighs_45g_mounted_on_a/

    data2 = filtfilt(b,a,data2);
    data2 = resample(data2,1000,3000);
    
'Test_1_edit.xlsx' is a 125804x4 (row, column) matrix.  The time samples are in column 1 and each time step is approximately .000833 seconds (1200Hz sampling rate).  Columns 2 - 4 are each individual channels of EMG data.

This is a guy who initially determined that the main support in the basement of the WTC was a potential target--the first attack was a truck of explosives driven into the parking basement--and later complained to Morgan Stanley that someone could fly a plane into the tower and drop it.

It occurs to me that the tower collapsed due to failure of the main support.  They had an insulating barrier to slow the process, but big iron buckles under hours of extreme heat.

... extreme heat.

Guys.  It's a giant piece of steel.

Can we not run a pipe down the center of this thing as a coolant channel, and breech it to feed the fire suppression system?  I mean, what if we engineered main support beams to be permanent water conduits, such that the main support is cooled by the activation of the fire suppression system for the entire duration of any fire?

Seriously.  If the support beams didn't get hot, would the towers have collapsed?  Wouldn't the support beam be the absolute best protection for a fire suppression system?  If you damage the support beam significantly enough, the tower collapses; you have fire suppression unless you knock the tower down.

40,"Want to leave the auto industry, but not sure where to start...",1404310990,"Hi AskEngineers,

I'm an electrical &amp; mechanical engineer with about 5 years spent in the auto industry now. I've done work mainly in electronics and software; building test equipment, programming, designing hardware. I use my mechanical background infrequently, but it does help sometimes for things like thermal design considerations or metallurgy when considering material choices. My concentration in college was power electronics &amp; alternative energy systems.

I have become extremely disenchanted with the auto industry. I WANT OUT! I have lived and worked in Michigan, namely, the metro-Detroit area, for my entire life. Cars have never been a passion for me. Frankly, they bore me to tears. The product development cycle for autos is to just re-invent the wheel every year and stick a new badge on the product. There is hardly any real innovation or challenges. The only reason I got into the field was because I was engaged to a woman from Michigan who refused to leave her family. I have since removed her from my life, am with a wonderful girl who wants me to pursue my goals, and I am ready to get back to pursuing a career that is also a passion.

However, I am having a really hard time getting noticed by anybody hiring other than auto-related companies in the Great Lakes area. I must have turned down two dozen job interviews already because I simply said I wasn't interested.

My questions are:

**1) How difficult is it going to be to get a job in a new field with basically all my experience in the auto industry** (aside from my undergrad degree work and 6 months of experience as a research assistant in a power electronics lab)? Am I going to be searching for an extended period to finally find something?

**2) What areas of the US have the most alternative energy jobs?**Wind, solar, etc.

**3) Do I need more schooling to work in this field? If so, what specialties seem to help?**

**4) Does anybody who made an big industry transition like I am looking to do have any pointers?**

However, for financial and other reasons, I'm in a position where it seems I may have to drop out to work full-time, and complete my degree later - hopefully, only 1 year later than before. I'm in the process of finding a job for that year, and ideally would do something that moves me down an engineering path. Everywhere I look stipulates at the very minimum a degree, usually with prior experience. Perhaps I'm not using the right search terms, but I'd like to do something more future-oriented than working in a coffeeshop. (I've got nothing against coffeeshops, they're the nicest jobs I've held; it just doesn't advance me in any way at this point to pour latte art)

This is for a piece of tech that will have a disk shaped piece of aluminum at its core to act as a heat sink/structural support.

The ridges of the ""waffle"" I'm thinking will be milled/cut into an i-beam shape, and the pockets of the waffle will be open space (waffle design to reduce weight).  The outer ring will be larger than the disk and can either be milled from the same starting piece or attached somehow later.  Hopefully that makes sense outside my own head.  Picture a steering wheel with a thin waffle inside the ring.

Anyway, I'm trying to determine the minimum thickness I could get away with for something like this, if, say the outer ring was covered in a high density foam, and the flat part of the waffle was sandwiched with various electronics then sealed securely so there is no room for movement inside (and the outer ring protrudes enough so the inner area does not touch the ground).

Me: A young civil engineer, three years out from my Masters degree, with a background in transportation engineering.

Previous employment: Starting salary out of graduate school was $45,000. They lowballed me but I was desparate for employment.

Current status: Working for a university in a smallish Midwestern city. Current salary is $80,000 with solid retirement (they actually contribute more than I do at the max level) and health insurance (PPO premiums are covered 100%).

Potential move: I'm in discussions with a fairly small transportation engineering firm in the Seattle area. My background is pretty close to what they're looking for in their current opening although I will need to be trained in a few things.

I went to my local electronics supply store to pick up a replacement fan.  All they had was a smaller 24V 0.06A Cooling fan.  Now mounting the smaller fan should not be an issue as there are multiple mounting holes pre-drilled into the grills inside the amp, but will I have an issue with the differences in amperage between these two fans?

81,Career Guidance: The benefits and costs of a foreign internship in Spain,1404121062,"Hello esteemed engineers,
I have the best kind of problem on my hands. I have been offered an internship in Spain as a Health Safety Enviornment engineer (I am American) and I am debating taking the position vs. continuing looking for a job in the states. Here is an overview of my job responsibilities to give you guys an idea of what experience I will develop.
    
    Provide support in Technical Safety activities: 
    
    * HAZOP 
    * SIL 
    * Hazardous Area (Electrical) Classification 
    * Gas detection specification and location 
    * Dispersion, Fire and Explosion studies and QRA 
    * Coordination of Third Parties (for studies) 
    * Action Tracking 
    * Document Review and Revision 
 
    Provide support in Loss Prevention activities: 

    * Definition of Fire Zones, Fire Hazardous Equipment 
    * Location of fire water appliances (hydrants and monitors) 
    * Definition of Passive Fire Protection requirements 

I seek advice on the following questions. 

* Will taking a foreign internship be positive for my resume? Would it help me if I wanted to seek future positions in Europe? Will it look good to US employers as I will be seen as having international business experience?

* Will a 1500 euro monthly salary be livable in Madrid? Will this salary effect my future earnings potential? Average starting salary in my degree is about 60-70k usd. The company has addressed this disparity, noting that Spain has a lower cost of living and that past interns have had enough money to live and travel. Traveling to other cities in Europe is a huge motivator for me taking this position. 

* Will taking a year of internships after already completing my BS look to employers like I am not as driven as my classmates who have sought and have locked down full employment?

* If you were in a similar position right out of college, would you take the opportunity or continue looking for full time work. 

Thank you all for your feed back, insight, and shared experience.

(My first job was not a good fit and the job description was not evenly remotely close to what the actual job involved, so I got out ASAP). 

I've been with my second employer for 8 months now and am backlogged about 4 weeks because I was involuntarily placed onto 8 different projects varying in size and workload. I couldn't really say no, management told me I had to work on all these projects because we're so understaffed (8 people have quit since January 2014 and we have not hired replacements for them yet). I report to 3 different people, 2 of which are usually out of the office and on the road travelling. None of these managers ever seem to communicate with each other, so I'm using getting yanked around all day to work on different things.  Needless to say, I am slightly misguided at work, very overwhelmed, and under mentored; all of which hurt my productivity on the job. 

I have learned a ton of stuff working here for 8 months, and have been increasing my work output ever since, but I can't seem to keep up with the demand. As a result, I often have disgruntled coworkers jokingly telling me I'm not doing my job, stating that I'm useless behind my back, and whining about me in general. I typically work 50 hours per week (I was doing 55-60 for a month, and was getting burnout and irritable/ depressed). I'm not willing to sacrifice my health by working more hours than I do now to please my coworkers. 

How do I diffuse the passive aggressive comments, and more importantly manage my workload without sacrificing my well being? I've already considered leaving when I find another job, but that would be my 3rd job since college...

I have just read a story about the construction of the Brooklyn bridge. But one question has awaken in my mind that I cannot think of the solution to (stuck in a mind loop). 

My question is about the wooden caisson which made it possible to build the foundation of the towers possible? and the construction over all? 

I read that they used wooden caissons which weighed 3000 tonnes and functioned by the diving bell principle and later filled with cement. But how did they level the gigantic caisson when they sank it? This while they were building the rock foundation on the top of the caisson, which would add to the necessary weight to sink the coffin? 

What is happening to all the biological matter which this caisson consist of, and the rock towers are standing on, between the concrete and the rock (I pressume it wouldn't be possible to remove it afterwards)? Shouldn't it decompose over the time? Doesn't this cause the towers to stand on unstable floor? Do they calculate that lack of oxygen will hinder the decomposition of the biological material?

Also one of the towers were not built on the rock floor but on the soft sludge, did they pole the ground or are the tower sinking within a reasonable time and degree?

And how did they do this with the 19th centry technology?

(Hope you understand my question since English is not my native language)

The green pipe is a nickel-plated copper tube that runs cooling water through a chamber containing steam. The steam condenses and is collected in the turquoise trough below. 

The boxes represent temperatures (in centigrade) at various locations. For example, the steam enters the system at 98.3C and leaves as a condensate at 81.5C, and so on.

My question involves the three yellow readings (thermocouple #2, #4, and #6), which reads the outside surface temperature of the cooling tube.

Why is the reading in the middle of the tube the lowest reading of all three?

94,"Electricity rate pricing. How much goes to infrastructure, and how much to paying for the energy source?",1403997055,"Not sure if there is anyone here who may know the answer to this, or if this is the right place. But here it goes.

Basically I am wondering what the breakdown of the price of a kwh is. So say it is 10cents a kwh. Roughly (just looking for an approximate number) how much of the 10 cents is paying for the infrastructure (all overhead, lineman, trucks) and how much goes to paying for the base energy source (just the coal, natural gas, etc.). I know there is a lot of variance from location, but I would think it would be fairly similar everywhere. I know infrastructure is really expensive, but I am curious on how they amortorize paying for it (30years? 50 years? 10years?). Do power companies (/government) subsidize either or both components? My gut feeling is, its closer to 50/50 for overhead and energy. But this is completely a guess.

Thanks in advance for any insights you may have.

Edit-Holy cow! Thanks for all the great responses! I am posing this question as I have been following renewables avidly and recently installed solar panels. My current energy provider is very open to and even incentivises residential PV. However, I know a lot of states charge extra if you install PV (transmission profit loss..). I was just trying to figure out how bad the overall picture is if one day we turn in to Germany and produce 50% power from renewables. If storage and renewable power generation becomes cheap enough, at some point the grid is going to simply be too expensive. If they are paying for the infrastructure 20-40years as /u/congelar commented, then it is definitely feasible in a decade or two for the grid to really be in trouble. My payback is around 8-12 years at current electricity rates. If one could finance an off the grid project over 40 years, you would be getting much closer to electricity rates (assuming costs continue to drop over the next decade). Of course, if the power companies want to make power, they should really be investing in solar PV/wind (I know many already are). If someone can be energy neutral in a 12 year payback, it seems that if you can finance the same project for 40years (energy company) and then charge the customer, you would be able to continue making money from that customer. I understand that there are more costs involved than what I incurred with my installation, but surely doing things in scale at a power company would also lower many of the costs I had (installation was half of the cost, panels the other half). I have just been thinking about it quite a bit, and I really don't see how power companies are going to make it in the future, without some major rethinking and re-pricing. If they raise prices to high, people will just go off the grid, making them have to raise prices higher.

98,Software Engineers: How to make Testing more Agile?,1403981037,"I'm a pretty new software engineer working at a self-described Agile engineering place. 

However, the way we're currently doing upgrade testing is pretty much the opposite of agile. We do maybe 4-6 two-week sprints of feature development with QA and testing incorporated then an additional 2 sprints of ""Upgrade Testing"" before pushing our product out to customers. 

FWIW we do big data stuff based on a lot of customer data in large relational databases which we operate on through SQL and Java. We also have a Salesforce component for some customers that they use to interact with our product through REST resources written in Java. 

Currently, for upgrade testing, we go back and re-test every feature before we release. By the time we start with upgrade testing, we're anywhere from two weeks to two months removed from the actual feature development, and we have to test a lof of separate things. We do this pretty efficiently through doing a full pass of all of the complex steps in our product using real customer data in a cloned environment. 

In every single upgrade cycle I've been a part of, we've always found tons of bugs during this upgrade testing phase. It's a ton of overhead, but it's helped us avoid some product-breaking bugs. 

Still, it sucks. We're passing upgrade testing tasks around the world to our remote team and back again for 24-hour (probably more like 16 hour) work going on. We also have bugs being created and passed to whichever dev is open, likely not the same dev who origonally developed the feature that had a bug. 

I think the answer is fewer features in each release (ideally 1 feature per release) which would allow us to vastly reduce the scope of upgrade testing, hopefully leading to less overhead. 

However, one of our other products just got burned by a terrible upgrade. At the end of the upgrade window (2AM - 9AM), everybody thought the product was fine and went to bed. At 10AM, people got called again because they broke pretty much everything (like seriously, integration between the front and back end was broken). This really made the entire engineering department look bad and everybody is pushing for slower release schedules to increase testing because of this.

I know this is a lot of information, but any anecdotal information would be helpful.

2.	Does this profession/discourse community require me to be familiar with particular terminology?  If so, what do I need to do to familiarize myself with the common terminology?
3.	What types (genres) of documents will I produce as a member of this profession?
4.	What audiences will the documents I produce need to address?  How will my audiences shape my tone?  For example, if you are planning to be a software engineer and you need to write whitepapers, will you be writing them for a lay audience, who knows almost nothing about computer code, or for other engineers?
5.	What purposes will my documentation fulfill?  For example, will you be communicating with your boss about the latest product you’ve designed for the company?  Writing an informal report about a business conference?  Creating a formal scientific report detailing your research findings?  
6.	What writing habits can I develop now that will help me in my chosen profession?

thanks!

So my washing machine died the other day and I don't want to throw [**this**](http://imgur.com/a3HTVBh,SwDu9vl,P61YeFF,R5KFCL8,4onXEL6,uRoUtMA#5) beauty away. I was trying to think up some uses for the motor and have decided on using it in a pig roast pit to turn the pig/lamb on a spit obviously. 

I am wondering what would be the best way to tune the motors 16000RPM down to 1-5RPM? It would be great if I could come up with a control circuit using a potentiometer or something to select between 1-5 RPM. 

Another path could be by using gears. Is it even realistically possible to bring the RPM of this motor down to somewhere between 1 and 5 RPM? 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks all.

14,Need help to reduce vibrations and resonance coming from a neighbor's AC Unit.,1403847487,"Hello /r/AskEngineers. I need some help. I hope this is
the right subreddit, otherwise my apologies and please let me know where it
is best to post this.
 
I live in an apartment on 4th floor of a 12-story building, and I am 
suffering from a serious issue of vibrations and resonance originating
from a window air conditioner from the apartment right above me. 

I believe that I am sensitive to low frequencies, but the noise
and vibrations in walls are real, and verified by other people. Nights are 
horrible and I had to leave the main bed room for good and sleep with
ear plugs in other room. This situation has caused me a lot of problems with
my neighbor and so far the only thing I have been able to get from
him is to put some soft material on the sides and below his AC unit, which 
surprisingly, it did not have almost any effect. This neighbor has been very 
uncooperative (I have not been able to make tests), and my lack of understanding 
of the phenomenon leaves me in the dark. 

While I pursue other actions with the municipality to try to seat with 
this person and a mediator and sort of improve the situation
(I live in a 3rd world country in south america, this is a hard thing
to do here); I nevertheless 
need to understand better the causes and how can reduce a bit the resonance in my
master bedroom. I could hire an acoustics engineer but I have not found
him/her yet in my area and then I want to try something by myself in the meantime.
I am an EE and understand signals and waveforms.

I am sure that the noise comes from the compressor of the AC above me. I have no 
access to that AC unit (I only have a picture of it). 

The walls are made of concrete blocks (masonry), 
and the building has concrete columns. The dimensions 
of the bedroom is 3,33 x 3,35m (almost a perfect square). I have read that a square 
is the worst possible shape for a room regarding resonances. Height is 2,35m. The
room has a window with a false balcony  made of bricks to hide the AC units.

My first question is how it is possible that an external AC unit generates such noise
and vibration?. It is more related to the shape of the rooms or to a improper install?

(A friend of mine went to neighbor's apartment once and told me that
the noise of their unit in their apartment was not particularly loud).

I do have a window AC unit myself in that very room, but it does not makes that magnitude of 
resonance or vibration. Of course if I turn my AC on when the other AC is on, the 
interference patterns and noise are incredible.


My second question: what frequency is driving me crazy? I have an iphone app that
tells me that the peak frequency is close to 56Hz, but I am not sure human can hear
that frequency.... [this](http://i.imgur.com/cveXcgJ.png) is the FFT 
with compressor OFF/ON.


I am planning to build some bass traps with mineral wool in form of panels,
place them in the corners of the room (as the standard procedure for
studio rooms). However, other strategy is to build a 
double ceiling with similar materials (since de noise comes from above). A third strategy
is to cover my window with a curtain made of that material (thinking that the noise
may come from outside too). 

My 3rd question:  Is any of these strategies any good? Which one is better or worse? 


I would appreciate any insight about my questions. As I said, I want to do something while
I can find an acoustics engineer ... if you need more information I can
add it in the comments.

Thanks!

**TL;DR:  noise from a window AC unit from upper floor neighbor resonates and vibrates
in my perfectly squared bedroom and is driving me crazy. What 
can I do?**

I am currently making a system using RFID tags and readers. I have RFID tags in a box, and use readers like this image below

http://imgur.com/l1Bq9t6

The green rectangles are my reader antennas


My rfid tags are stackable and are using 13.56 MHZ. The IC in my tags are chinese brand using ISO 15693. 

At first, we used two antennas to counter the problem when my reader and tag is perpendicular (90 degrees). In theory I only need 2 antennas (A and B, see my image). However, when we tested it with our antennas, there are some tags that cannot be read. We added a third antenna (C) and it works perfectly now. 

The problem is, I do not want to add a third antenna. Each antenna is around $30 which equals an extra 30,000 at my quantity. Does anyone have any suggestions to only use two antennas? I have tried changing the angles of the antenna with respect towards the box etc.

I'm just not getting why.  You can measure the time accurately, so why not the distance?  e.g. at a distance of 600 meters is the target.  You emit a 1 us pulse. It takes 2 us for the rising edge to get there, 2 us to get back to your receiver - 4 us/2 will give you your range.  If the target was 75 meters closer, it would be 1.75 us out, 1.75 back, and you're at 3.5 us, not 4.

I need to create very humid air in a vented chamber, through which gas will flow. That is, I need humidify air coming out of an air compressor.

To do this, I'm thinking I have a couple options. 

1. Put an atomizer in the chamber to replace the gas bubbling through liquid water. I can't find an atomizer that would be appropriate for this. 

2. Boil water in the chamber and vent the steam out, letting it cool to room temperature in a coil of stainless steel before it reaches its destination. The problem with this is the chamber I made is PVC and not rated for greater than 140 degrees F.

I didnt follow up my career in engineering or electronics for this time (I worked in a company making spectacles!) but have 

recently, and rather luckily, managed to get a job in a rather large and busy factory as a maintenance engineer with an 

electrical bias (though my title is Electrical Control Engineer). They took me on based on my test scores for PLC programming and want to push me towards that eventually.

In the meantime I am trying to be an electrician. Its all a bit rushed and I need some advice on what to do. I've been dropped in at the deep end a bit which is both scary and exciting.

Anyone got any suggestions on how I can move on from here? I dont mean I want to leave the company, not yet anyway. Just an 

idea of progression. Maybe some book or course ideas for swatting up on electrician skills maybe? Anyone else broken out of 

their post-university career tangent in a similar way?",AskEngineers,aqueousdan,/r/AskEngineers/comments/291hcz/trying_to_get_on_track_with_my_career_need_help/

Background: I am experienced in the exact field and have had a nearly identical role for the past several years (&lt;5). I expect that many of the other candidates were younger and new to the industry, including recent graduates. I am familiar with the industry and I believe a strong component of my value as a candidate is that I will require far less training that a recent graduate. I'm not an expert but I am very  comfortable a familiar with the application of the systems that I will be using. 

My major concern with the offer I've received is that the base salary is very similar to my current standing, but I would be crossing a state line and increasing my tax obligation. I expect that the (admittedly fair) offer instead ends up being ""worth"" a few thousand dollars less per year. My overall expectation for any job offer should be that I'm receiving an increase, almost no matter what. 

I've heard some advice that I should stress my value to the company, and other advice that I should be realistic and straightforward with them for the circumstances. I'm not sure what exactly is appropriate. 

At this point, I expect to stress that my background is valuable and discuss from that perspective. However, I'm just curious as to the general views of others.

58,"Connecting a transformer to a wind turbine system to activate an inverter for grid tie-in, need clarification.",1403649016,"I have a vertical axis wind turbine connected to a 1400-96V Airboss PMA generator. The turbine produced 3 phase AC which is rectified to DC and inverted back to 3 phase AC for dumping to the grid. The turbine is rather large and the wind speed averages 1-2 m/s, so it spins pretty slowly if at all. In order for the inverter to activate, it needs a minimum of 50V DC from the rectifier which translates to ~37V AC (3 phase) from the generator. Since my generator doesn't produce this high of voltage regularly, I was given the recommendation to install a x5 delta transformer to boost the voltage. Here is a schematic of the I have been advised to install: https://imgur.com/8PCpGMZ 

My question is essentially this: What's the catch/drawback? There is only a limited amount of mechanical energy from the wind coming into the turbine and electrical system, so what will boosting the voltage do to the system as a whole, as in what am I losing by raising the voltage?

In fact, I'd guesstimate my bathroom breaks/walks to other peoples areas/getting tea only take about 10-15 minutes a day, which I commonly work over anyway. I've always noticed here that people from other departments seem to have time to have personal conversations with each other, take long lunches, and other things I actively avoid, but I always just assumed that was poor management on their boss's part. However, after a get together with my extended family and hearing stories from their jobs, I began wondering if it was just engineering that seems to follow this trend or possibly just the engineering division in my company.

Now I don't have a huge depth of knowledge on bolted connections, but from working on vacuum systems metal and soft seals generally they have some non-zero leak rate. I have a sinking feeling that holding 750 psig for 24 hours is going to be functionally impossible.

/r/AskEngineers and other similar subreddits often receive questions from people looking for guidance in the field of engineering. Is this degree right for me? How do I become a ___ engineer? What’s a good project to start learning with? While simple at heart, these questions are a gateway to a vast amount of information.

Each Monday, I’ll be posting a new thread aimed at the community to help us answer these questions for everyone. Anyone can post, but the goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses will be compiled into a wiki for everyone to use and hopefully give guidance to our fellow upcoming engineers and hopefuls.

To help both myself and anyone reading your answers, I’d like if everyone could follow the format below. The example used will be my own.

Field: Electrical Engineering – RF Subsystems    
Specialization (optional): Attenuators    
Experience: 2 years

[Post details here]


This formatting will help us in a few ways. Later on, when we start combining disciplines into a single thread, it will allow us to separate responses easily. The addition of specialization and experience also allows the community to follow up with more directed questions.
***
To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions for everyone. Answer as much as you want, or write up completely different questions and answers.

* What inspired you to become an ______ Engineer?    
* Why did you choose your specialization?    
* What school did you choose and why should I go there?    
* I’m still in High School, but I think I want to be a _____ Engineer. How do I know for sure?    
* What’s your favorite project you've worked on in college or in your career?    
* What’s it like during a normal day for you?


We've gotten plenty of questions like this in the past, so feel free to take inspiration from those posts as well. Just post whatever you feel is useful!

75,Uniform Laminar Flow Within a Cylindrical Donut,1403544173,"Hello Reddit,

Myself and a colleague are attempting to do an experiment evaluating some effects of exercising fish within a cylindrical donut tank. I have attached images to help visualize the tank set up.  The dimensions of the tank are:
Outer Cylinder
D=67cm
H=60cm

Inner Cylinder (draining stand pipe)
D=16cm

However, we are running into an issue maintaining horizontally and vertically uniform laminar flow near 30cm/sec.  At these speeds we seem to develop small eddies and velocity hot-spots at various points throughout the cylinder.  Neither of us is a physicist by any means, so we're kind of stuck.  Does anyone on list have any suggestions for creating a more uniform circular flow?  It must be created without direct mechanical force, ie no paddles, propellers, etc. as fish will be swimming freely between the center guard and the outer main cylinder (see pics).  

Most fish exercise experiments are done using chambers with a propeller at one end, or racetrack like tanks, however, we want to minimize handling and are limited by space and materials.  If anyone has experience with this sort of system, we would greatly appreciate it.

But I don't know what types of mission there are out there, what can change and what sort of aircraft can specialize for what mission, and how.

I can maybe think about different kinds of mission: reconnaissance/spying, interception, ground support, targeted bombing...

The part I'm struggling with is *once the test has been conducted*, where does the actual NPSHR value come from? Is it simply the pressure at the inlet corresponding to the 3% reduction in flow?

At the place co-op, all the armatures, whether stator or rotor, are wound like the first link.

With this, we'd get an high efficiency, low cost per kWh and small footprint (compared to current hydro pump storage) system which could be used to power renowable energy even further.

My first real question I have that I can't find explained that I can understand, is how does AC work when the voltage goes positive to negative.  The way I picture it, when the voltage goes up and then down from say + 480 to (-)480, the electrons would go through the load on their way to ground, and then back away from it to the higher negative potential.  I am picturing potential difference as a pressure difference, and the electrons, or current, are like a working fluid that keeps going to a lower pressure.  I have seen incandescent lights under a high speed camera and seen the light flicker when the voltage lights up, so I understand how power is transferred on a sinusoidal wave, but when it goes to a negative voltage I don't see how current still goes forward through the system.

30,Vertical Rocket Launch System?,1403202446,"I had an idea and I'm curious if it would work or not. 

I understand that the hardest part of getting a payload into orbit is to give it the tangential velocity needed to maintain orbit, rather than just getting it to orbital height. As such, it takes much less energy to reach orbital height than it does to stay in orbit there.

What I'm imagining is a rocket system that takes advantage of this. Imagine you had a launch system with two components:

1. A lightweight rocket designed to provide just enough thrust to take a payload to orbital height. 

2. A space station in that orbit substantially more massive than the payload. 

The rocket would launch on a straight vertical trajectory designed to intersect the path of the station. The payload would be launched, and the station would have a mechanism to safely catch the payload as they intersected. 

The station would remain in orbit because the station's mass would be substantially larger than the payload's mass, say 100x-1000x. 

Now, obviously there's no free lunch, so we still have to come up with some delta v for the station-payload system. When the station captures the payload, it doesn't fall out of orbit, but its forward velocity does decrease. To fix this, each payload would carry a small amount of reaction mass that can be fed into an efficient ion or plasma engine for station-keeping. 

Could such a system work? The biggest challenge would be finding a way to catch a payload at such extreme velocity differences, but perhaps it's possible. ",AskEngineers,isleepinahammock,/r/AskEngineers/comments/28kmf9/vertical_rocket_launch_system/

32,Steel Plate Deflection,1403199626,"I am trying to convince myself that I am using a formula from the AISC manual correctly.

The project is to design a large counterwieght for a device, and I am designing it as a steel plate box welded together and filled with concrete.

Here is the problem:
I want to design the counterweight walls to a deflection standard of L/360 so 0.09 inches. The depth of the box is 33 inches and is about 20 ft wide. It will have a bottom brace and a top brace while placing concrete.

My assumptions:
I am planning to use 1/2"" plate, E=29x10^6, weight of concrete 150#/cf

My calculation:
I am simplifying this down to a simple beam, so the beam will be 33"" long, 12"" wide, and 0.5"" thk. with bending in the 0.5"" thk. direction. My concrete will be at full liquid head so the beam will be loaded with a continious load increasing to one side (a triangle) with the top (left if you did a traditional beam drawing horizontaly on a sheet of paper) having a support and 0 load, and the bottom (right) having 412.5 lbs. ...aka W would be 150 lbs/lf... 
Looking at the AISC manual for delta_max or any publication online the formula for a simply supported beam with a concentrated load increasing to one side is: delta_max= 0.013[(wL^3)/(EI)]
My I=(bh^3)/12 = (12""x0.5^3)/12 = 0.125in^4
sub all into delta_max eq. = 0.013((150*33^3)/(29,000,000*0.125*12)) and I get 0.0016 in.

Here is my problem, 0.0016 inches my world isn't even recognizable to any equipment I own so basically there is no deflection. My intuition is just not allowing me to believe that there will be no deflection in this plate. 

Can anyone double check my work/tell me that my assumption is incorrect that this is a simple beam problem. I understand that it is simplifying it to a degree but I am at a loss with the number the formula give me.

Last summer I worked in Construction department and this summer I am working in the Planning and Engineering department. I think that I would like to work in plan development for a career once I graduate. 

  
My question is, can anyone here give me some pros and cons of working for the DOT versus working for a private consulting company? I feel as if I have a very good shot at getting hired at the DOT, but I can't help but feel like I may be missing out if I do work there. 

  
My starting salary would be $41,350 for my first year, with annual pay increases each year for a while. I will have a fairly heavy student loan burden that I'm estimating to be around $750/month on the standard 10 year repayment plan. If I worked for the state I would be eligible to have my loans forgiven after 10 years and I would probably be on the pay as you earn repayment plan. This is another factor in my decision. 

  
I am married and my wife will also have a large sum of loans, roughly $500/month and she will bring home around $35,000 annually. I would like to be able to live comfortably, which I know can be done if I plan ahead and make smart decisions. 

  
Any help that you all could give me in making a decision would be greatly appreciated. I have made a mock budget for when we graduate assuming I work for the state and we could make it and have some to put into savings and retirement. I just want to make sure I am making the best decision for our long term. I understand that some of this May be better suited for r/personalfinance but I feel as if the help of fellow engineers would be more helpful since I can do the math of different scenarios on my own. I'm really most interested in hearing what everyone thinks is the wisest career path to follow. 

  
TL;DR: Which is best, State vs. Private career path for a CE with a focus in transportation. ",AskEngineers,jazick,/r/AskEngineers/comments/28hcpj/soon_to_be_civil_engineering_graduate_looking_for/

64,How does a defective car ignition switch kill people?,1403112941,"All the articles I find are about recalls, list of victims and legal proceedings. I can't find a technical *cause-and-effect* explanation.

I can't find much beyond a hint that a defective switch may turn off the 12 V power. But a car without 12 V power can still be steered and can still be braked (albeit harder to do than with servos).

So, technically, what causes such accidents?

Is it an electrical event (the 12 V is turned off)?

Or is it a mechanical event (the key changes position)?

Is insufficient driver education partially to blame?

There are multiple reasons that the 12 V could die, such as a blown fuse. None of them should result in accidents: a good driver should be able to maintain control of a powerless car.

EDIT: Atomiktoaster gave us a reference (the Valukas report) which indicates it's a mechanical event: vibrations allow the key to rotate to the ACC position (servo steering and braking are off, air bags won't work) or even the OFF position (steering wheel locks).

Thank you all.

65,Looking for MATLAB Live Data Acquisition Help,1403106130,"First off, I'm a soon to be junior Electrical/Computer Engineering student spending the summer researching at a university.  My task this summer has been to create a MATLAB file that can collect voltage/current data through a computer terminal, filter the data to remove excess noise (using a Butterworth filter), then find peaks in the noisy data (using a sliding window technique) before finally comparing peaks in the voltage and current to find matching peaks.  

Currently my program works smoothly and is relatively fast but my adviser would like me to make the program complete all these task in real time and display the filtered data with peaks to the user as it's taken from the terminal.  I've been struggling to make this happen and the only live filter I can find is a Kalman filter which may be too advanced for me.  I'm not even sure if it's possible due to the computing power needed to make this happen and the nature of data collection in MATLAB.

76,Questions about prospective transfer to engineering school from highly selective liberal arts college,1403030076,"Hi Reddit,

Today I come with a question about deciding the direction I take with engineering. I currently go to a highly selective liberal arts school, and in my first year I have done a lot of soul searching and I think that engineering will best suit my interests and wishes for my lifestyle that I want for the future. I greatly enjoy math, physics, and biology, and I'm currently doing a biomedical engineering REU, which I'm enjoying a great deal.

First, how is BME as a career? I've heard only extremely polarized and opposite opinions regarding BME, with some saying it's a passing craze and leads to unqualified ""faux-engineers"" who can't do anything real, while the other side is preaching that BME is the best field right now and for a long time, that there will be jobs, growth, etc. 

What is the opinion here?

Second, I'm a bit confused as to how to proceed with securing an engineering job. I'm considering either completing a physics degree at my college and searching for an engineering job, completing a 3-2 program at another school, hopefully to earn a BME undergrad degree and probably physics or bio from my current college, or I am considering transfer as early as possible, perhaps for the next spring semester.

Part of my motivation is the financial costs of school, as my parents are hesitant to support an extra year in college because of their own financial reasons. Currently, I have generous aid at my college.

Is a 3-2 program worth the extra fiscal stress it would put on my family and I?

On the other hand, I can transfer and hopefully finish a degree in four years. However, if I were to transfer, I have no idea what type of engineering i should major in. I have more than average bio research experience for my age/grade level, so I want to pursue BME. However, I have also met a lot of people who started as one of the ""core"" engineers (electrical, mechanical, etc), who are doing grad school work in BME. Can anyone shed light on a good major for my situation?

Finally, if I stay at my college, I would probably earn a master's in BME or some other engineering later on. Is this option worth it? I'm not sure that I can go to grad school straight out of college, so do you all think I can get an [engineering] job with a BS in physics, and then have the company finance my master's?

My brother and I want to make an electric bicycle for a summer project and we had a few questions/concerns that should be addressed to see if this project is even possible. 

Pic of bike: http://imgur.com/UN9gdjV

First, will the motor we currently have work for what we are trying to accomplish? Will it be able to start from a standstill? a roll? or work when its already up to speed? Here are some pics next to a coke can for size.

Front: http://imgur.com/h5OWKTW

Rear: http://imgur.com/64WbKAH

Our next concern is how we will link the motor output to the bike itself. This is the motor output: http://imgur.com/kQt8I7w and here are the bike sprockets: http://imgur.com/I0esRPg
Are we going to need a different motor output shaft? Open to suggestions on this one.
Would it be possible for both the pedals and the motor to be operable? And how could we do this?

We were thinking it would be cool to have a clutch (to 'disconnect' the motor from the rear wheel) would this be something that could make our system a little bit better (i.e. easier to work with pedals/motor)?

Lastly what battery do you think I should use? Size, weight, where to buy etc.

If you have any other concerns about our project please let me know. If you want anymore pics I'd be happy to post them. Figured this was the right sub to post this on but let me know if you think I'll get better feedback elsewhere.

[Post details here]


This formatting will help us in a few ways. Later on, when we start combining disciplines into a single thread, it will allow us to separate responses easily. The addition of specialization and experience also allows the community to follow up with more directed questions.
***
To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions for everyone. Answer as much as you want, or write up completely different questions and answers.

* What inspired you to become an Industrial Engineer?    
* Why did you choose your specialization?    
* What school did you choose and why should I go there?    
* I’m still in High School, but I think I want to be a Industrial Engineer. How do I know for sure?    
* What’s your favorite project you've worked on in college or in your career?    
* What’s it like during a normal day for you?


We've gotten plenty of questions like this in the past, so feel free to take inspiration from those posts as well. Just post whatever you feel is useful!

97,Ultrasonic defectoscopy as a trade?,1402939497,"Hello fellow engineers and engineering enthusiasts.

So I was thinking about taking a company-startup loan, buying an ultrasonic defectoscope and making that my job, since I've always wanted to be my own boss. I never had experience with the trade, and I don't know anyone who does, so I reach out to you. Don't worry, I'll be no competition to you - I'm settled in central Europe :) .

How feasible is it for a youg man with a lot of free time and motivation to gain enough expertise to start doing this profesionally? I am ready to do all the research, reading and learning necessary. I'm a mech eng. student, so I have access to a decent technical library with books and norms about the subject. I also have my professors at the uni, and perhaps I could pick their brains from time to time too.

Secondly, the responsibility - obviously in the beginning I would reject jobs involving very critical structures like load-bearing parts of buildings, but I imagine that responsibility can be a burden anyway. How does it look like in real life?

Lastly, how are people with such experience looked at by employers, when applying for a job? Ultimately I might want to switch to testing or construction - will the defectoscopy experience not hold me back?

I know i don't want to get a cheap one, but i also don't want to spend a whole lot more that necessary.  I was unable to find the wattage of the motor as i'm sure that would be very helpful i could.

Also any guess (educated or not) about how many amp hours i would need to keep it running for 20-30 minutes would be greatly appreciated. For example i looked at a [Die Hard](http://www.sears.com/diehard-marine-deep-cycle-rv-battery-group-size-27m/p-02827524000P?sid=IDx01192011x000001&amp;kpid=02827524000&amp;kispla=02827524000P) that holds 105 amp hours, how do those amp hours translate when converted to AC? I really don't picture a single battery being able to power it long enough, and am trying to figure out how many i would want to use, not likely that battery though, that was just the first deep cycle batter that popped up on a Google search.

For now it will be just to cut the cord, and see if it works, but by the end of summer i intend to mount the batteries and mower in a frame using salvaged Power-Wheels motors with rubber tires, the steering from said salvaged child toys, and a remote control to make it all fun and easy.

I've seen it done with gas mowers, lots of neat kits, diys and production models online. I know it would be A LOT easier to start with a battery powered electric mower, but i already have this one, and i would like to use it, if this is a feasible project.

We rent them out to customers who are interested in trying out our chemical but are not yet willing to shell out capital to buy their own equipment.  Because they are rental tanks, they actually spend most of their lives empty (or with a little bit of water in the bottom) at our shop in Baltimore, MD. 

We are having a large problem with corrosion.  Most of the tanks were not coated when purchased.  We do not know why this decision was made, but it was before any of us engineers worked here.  The question now is what to do going forward.  

We tried to coat one tank after the fact, but determined that the prep work to do so (sandblasting) removed so much of the wall thickness that it made the tank unusable.   The current thought is that we may just coat the *outside* of the tank.  Currently, water seeps in behind the insulation, which creates a battery effect between the water on the outside and the slurry on the inside. Coating just the outside may help mitigate this battery effect, however I am skeptical.  I think the best option may be to do nothing and replace the tanks with stainless when the time comes.

Now I have to calculate a few things I have not yet that much experience with. These are:

* What size MCCB should I choose?
* What cable cross section should I choose?
* What size mains fuse should I have a contractor install?

Calculations:

Assuming:

* cos(phi) = 0.9

Then:

* Power: 8*2.2kW = 18kW
* Current: 18kW / (400 * 0.9) = 49A
* Line current: 49A / SQRT(3) = 28A

Thus: 

* MCCB: 50A
* Supply cable (mains -&gt; MCCB): 4mm^2
* Mains fuses: 32A blade fuses


I am always confused by phase current, total current and other currents. What does the current indication on a MCCB mean? Is it phase current for each phase? Or is it total current (i.e. phase current * sqrt(3))?

Can someone read my calculations, correct me and explain me where my thought process went wrong?

40,What is the the bulk modulus formula for anisotropic material?,1402644626,"I can understand the derivation of bulk modulus (K) for isotropic material. However I have difficulty to do the same for anisotropic material.

to start with we have the definition:
mean_stress = K * (strain_xx+strain_yy+strain_zz)

My question is for anisotropic material:
Is mean_stress = (stress_xx+stress_yy+stress_zz) / 3 or something else?

when the material is subjected to mean_stress (or hydrostatic pressure if you would like), the shear stresses will be zero, the same as the isotropic case, correct?

Then how do we derive the bulk modulus formula for anisotropic material using hooke's law (compliance) coefficients?

By the way, here is my guess. Please feel free to correct it.

While I'm pretty good at buying and repairing audio gear, I failed to consider the bonkers cost of the accessories.  
  
While I've been able to bodge replacements (why the hell does no one sell 8"" XLR cables, anyway?) for most, my big problem is an enclosure for all the electronics. They're either expensive, terrible, unsuitable, or all of the above.  
  
Thankfully, I was in FIRST robotics, so I know there's no problem that cannot be solved with enough aluminum extrusion. I am, however, a bit unfamiliar with building anything that isn't designed to stack PVC tetrahedrons, and suspect I might not make the best use of material. Here's my requirements:

* 6U 19"" rack capable of holding about sixty to seventy pounds of amp. I could've bought more modern amps, but hitting the gym was cheaper.
* Top-accessible enclosure for small non-rackmount mixer. Maybe some heavy-duty hinges?
* Not-so-easily removable rear panel to reconnect various innards as required.

42,Recent grads and experienced engineers: When to start applying for jobs?,1402634254,"First off, let me apologize if this sort of question is not allowed. When rearing the rules in the sidebar, I didn't think this sort of topic fell under any of the topics that are not supposed to be discussed here.

So, my question for all you recent grads and experienced engineers: When is the proper time to start applying for full time, post-undergraduate jobs?

I'll be entering my third year at RPI this coming August, and it will be my final year of undergraduate studies [I entered school with a full year's worth of AP credits]. However, I'm not entirely sure how early is necessarily too early to start looking for full time positions?

Unfortunately, I have not been able to find an internship anywhere, so I will be graduating without any ""real"" engineering experience. I'm hoping I can find a research position on campus this coming fall to help with that. However, that being said, I am slightly worried about how difficult it might be to find work given that I'm not necessarily as qualified as other people graduating at the same time as me.

At this point, I haven't really figured out when the appropriate time to start applying is. I've known people who were offered a full time position before first semester ended. I also know people who have not found work until the very end of second semester, and people who were not fortunate enough to find work until a few months after graduating. I'm hoping that by starting to apply early and often can put me in the boat of having a job offer before first semester even ends to maximize my chances of finding work.

I know the pump wouldn't ever get to a perfect vacuum, but is my thinking correct in that the atmosphere is what is supplying the pressure? Meaning the most you could ever hope for is 33.8 feet of pumping height. Or could the pump do more than that?

The problem is that the fence has slats on alternating sides so it'll be difficult to install a third rail.  They are now attempting to get us to argue with the city that since the fence is semi permiable due to the alternating boards the wind load is smaller than the code permits.

The audio source was an iphone 3g and I used a [sure-electronics ta2024](http://www.parts-express.com/2x15w-at-4-ohm-ta2024-class-d-audio-amplifier-board--320-308) based 2x15w amplifier to power 2 6.5"" 60w RMS marine speakers. It worked absolutely flawlessly.

[Photo of the enclosure](http://i.imgur.com/Lfb5wNs.jpg)

Here's the problem: 

Now that the float trip is over, I am attempting to convert the audio source to bluetooth. I picked up a [USB powered bluetooth adapter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/251505351382?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649) as well as a [3A 12v to 5v buck converter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/271303558034?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649).

I have everything hooked up correctly, but am experiencing quite a bit of feedback (it sounds like the data transmission signal from the bluetooth controller). I've narrowed it down to only occurring when the audio-out from the bluetooth adapter is connected to the audio-in on the amplifier while both are being powered by the same power source. Connecting the bluetooth adapter to a different power source eliminates the issue, as well as disconnecting the amplifier and connecting a set of self-powered pc speakers or headphones. 

My question: Is there anyway to eliminate this feedback while using only the single lipo battery pack as the powersource for both the bluetooth receiver and the amplifier?

I'm currently an aerospace engineering student, and my knowledge of anything relating to electronics, circuits, etc is not the kind of knowledge that would allow me to figure this out.

So, I have a wiring diagram for the sunroof module in my car.

[Wiring Diagram from Service Manual](http://i.imgur.com/ezMzfsG)

Now, my car is not a luxury car. It's a Subaru. It doesn't have any of the fancy features like my dad's last Acura or his current Infiniti where if you hit open while it's tilted up, it will tilt down then open or anything like that.

The one thing it does that I've never come across before and really bothers me (along with most other people that own these cars, so I've learned) is that the sunroom requires using the close switch twice to fully close. That is, when you push the close button, it only closes halfway and automatically stops. After that, you have to hit the close button again before it will continue to close fully.

I'd like to figure out some way to circumvent this. I know it can be done. There was a person who managed to design a module that added this and some of the other more luxurious features. Unfortunately, he made a very limited number of the modules (~30), and they were rather expensive at $100+ each. In the two or so years since he developed it, I've only seen 1 come up for sale.

Hi, I'm trying to make some put together a very basic valve and tubing system, but I have no clue as to what I'm doing with valve connections.

I'm looking for some valves that can handle pressures of up to 3000 psig, and temperatures around 600F. I'm looking through the catalogs, it seems that pressure rating actually *decreases* as the size of my valve *increases*. Obviously, I don't want to screw up with something this explosive, and I don't know if I'm even reading this thing right.

I am a strong book learner and have 'A' in all my ECE, physics, and math classes except my first DSP class I got a 'B'. Worst of all I was at the very top of two of my circuits classes, but never built a single circuits in lab! It's embarrassing - I either simulated them and/or did the lab write up for the group. I was at the top of both of my EM classes and really enjoyed the material. Now I work in a lab synthesizing Nanostructures and I don't really enjoy the hands on work of preparing samples or working with CVD equipment cause I'm just not good at understanding or fixing equipment. I just follow procedures, but when things break I have to get my professor to fix them. 
Am I just in the wrong field of study? Or are there area of ECE were I might fit in? I enjoyed my C and C++ programming classes and hope to take more classes to better understand memory mgt and data structures! But I don't want to switch to CS. I purchased a breadboard kit, but at home I don't have a scope, multimeter, or function generator that would allow me to retry my class labs.

So my plan is to make basically an oven out of plaster of paris mixed with sand by packing the stuff into a mold. I've read that plaster of paris can take 2,200°F. I've also read that sand increases that temperature but i'm not sure if the sand bit is true. I then want to line the inside with Kanthal A-1 wire which is an idea I got from someone else trying to do something similar. Kanthal A-1 wire is supposed to be able to get to 2,550°F. Since the max temperature I've found that is good to forge at is about 2,300°F I figured this wire would be a good choice. I plan to hook a dimmer switch up to the wire so it can heat up slowly and so I don't exceed the temperature range I want. 

So that's the plan and I would love any input anyone can give me. Especially if anyone knows anything about the Kanthal wire or mixing plaster of paris and sand.

90,"building a raft, differing inputs on anchor point.",1402442811,"My family at my cottage is building a raft. We are on lake erie, and often experience up to 4 foot waves.

the current idea is a 20' diameter circle design.

For safety reasons it was brought up to anchor it with chain rope from beneath the raft at the very center. this way smaller children using it have no chance of jumping into an anchor rope.

Problem being, all i see happening is when a wave comes, it has no anchored end point. It will just spin. Then more waves come and it will just spin more. Eventually it will hit its maximum wind up (whatever the technical term would be) then rapidly unravel or if its wavy enough just snap the chain. (this is my non-professional opinion)

We used to have a raft out that was around a 12'x40' rectangle anchored at the rear with plenty of slack chain, and in waves it just pointed with the waves and would rock up and down. This worked pretty much flawlessly, but there WAS a giant chain pulled tight at the back. So i can see those with children being concerned about this.

Any input on if it would even work anchored in the center? This is a section of lake erie that is no stranger to rough weather and the raft will be left out summer long.

95,Going solo... Thinking of making the jump and interested in your advice and stories of how it worked / didn't work for you,1402426041,"So a bit of background. This feels like it's going to be a long one! Sorry - tldr at bottom.

British CEng And Chartered Energy Engineer with Energy Institute. Graduated Masters in Elec Engineering 2004.

Always worked in small companies. My first role was for a small machine manufacturer in the generator rewind industry. Went in as part of a government sponsored graduate scheme to link small businesses with local university expertise. Was a tough role, and I was ultimately the companies most senior EE from an early stage which was worrying. Learnt quickly, mainly from listening and understanding those on the shop floor. Responsible for some pretty big company changes along with improvements across a wide product range.

5 years later I was offered the role of Technical Director at a new startup, specialising in renewable energy. It was a great opportunity and I couldn't turn it down. When I joined there was three off us and 3 years later it was a business of 24+. Again things weren't easy, but they were exciting.

However things started to go wrong after some commercial descision by the company chairman(and principle investor). The chairman had invested a lot of money in the business and was looking for his return, which is understandable. However this meant the product (retailing at circa £60k) was pushed through to full production and sales when the product was not market ready (again not that unusual but against my advice). However this meant my role turned from technical design to basically technical support and overseeing site teams running around trying to fix things which were continually breaking.

Things came to head when we identified a safety issue, and the chairman refused to allow us to issue a shutdown notice as it may 'damage the brand'. I believed that the risk was serious, however the chairman thought he knew better (obv based on his 20 years of fashion sales experience). I decided that I couldn't work in a situation like that, and left the day to day business. (Still non exec director)

I found a new job relatively quickly, working in renewable energy consultancy for a large organisation. I went in as a senior, so a bit of a drop down from technical director, but the wages are good and I needed the work and aren't located in an area with many energy businesses.

And I am still their now. A small piece in a much bigger machine. The main business isn't renewables, so we are a bit of a sideline, but things are busy and there is plenty of work coming in.

But I don't really enjoy it. I don't get anything particularly out of the work I'm doing, it's relatively easy and I don't feel like I'm going to change the world. I also struggle with having to report to a boss, especially with regards to reviewing of reports etc (I am 100% fine with technical checks - it's just where wording gets rewritten etc because the boss thinks it sounds better another way -purely subjective opinions). I also feel I spend my time doing work in a way that would please my boss, rather than the client.

And finally, we are really very expensive and bill on a time basis (6min incrs) rather than day rate. I therefore feel guilty putting effort into jobs, double checking things, putting in added value as I know this will get billed directly to the client. I'm always trying to keep my time worked on each job down - but sometimes feel this effects the quality of the work I want to deliver.

So I'm thinking of going solo (well partnership with a previous colleague). I do have a young family, mortgage etc and there is therefore significant risk in doing this. Most of the work I do is small packages 2-3k each, and it is therefore difficult to walk away with a big contract or key client to cushion the blow.

So that's my conundrum. Make the jump and try to build a new business, whilst finding enough income to pay the bills and feed the kids. Or stay in the comfortable job, churning out reports as quick as I can, but safe and secure!

I'm sure it's a very common position, and know you can't make the decision for me! But any words of wisdom, similar stories, suggestions or criticism would be greatly appreciated.

Tldr: stuck in mediocre engineering role after 8 years working for young innovative businesses. Thinking of going solo- any words of wisdom or advice greatly appreciated!!

/r/AskEngineers and other similar subreddits often receive questions from people looking for guidance in the field of engineering. Is this degree right for me? How do I become a ___ engineer? What’s a good project to start learning with? While simple at heart, these questions are a gateway to a vast amount of information.

Each Monday, I’ll be posting a new thread aimed at the community to help us answer these questions for everyone. Anyone can post, but the goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses will be compiled into a wiki for everyone to use and hopefully give guidance to our fellow upcoming engineers and hopefuls.
***

**Post Formatting**    

***

To help both myself and anyone reading your answers, I’d like if everyone could follow the format below. The example used will be my own.

Field: Electrical Engineering – RF Subsystems    
Specialization (optional): Attenuators    
Experience: 2 years

[Post details here]


This formatting will help us in a few ways. Later on, when we start combining disciplines into a single thread, it will allow us to separate responses easily. The addition of specialization and experience also allows the community to follow up with more directed questions.
***
To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions for everyone. Answer as much as you want, or write up completely different questions and answers.

* What inspired you to become a Computer Engineer?    
* Why did you choose your specialization?    
* What school did you choose and why should I go there?    
* I’m still in High School, but I think I want to be a Computer Engineer. How do I know for sure?    
* What’s your favorite project you’ve worked on in college or in your career?    
* What’s it like during a normal day for you?


We’ve gotten plenty of questions like this in the past, so feel free to take inspiration from those posts as well. Just post whatever you feel is useful!

7,Engineers more conservative?,1402376010,"Hello, this is something I have been curious about for quite some time.  

A lot of people have said that engineers typically lean right.  I'm about halfway through engineering college studying computer engineering (physics double major) with plans to get a Master's degree, and this definitely doesn't describe me at all, I lean pretty left both socially and economically.  

I can understand why there'd be a classical conservative/libertarian bent as many engineers are high earners and tend to emphasize efficiency and simplicity (small government), and I've seen a fair few of these in my engineering class, is this what people mean when they say ""engineers are conservative""?  Or do they mean that the majority of engineers are socially conservative as well as fiscally ie against gay marriage, Earth is 6,000 years old and Darwin was a Nazi, Religious Right stuff?  Becuase if that's the case I may need to change majors :P

But I haven't observed the latter case at all among my class or in the engineers I know who are practicing, and only one person at my internship even gave a hint that he was religious.

Is this really the case, and if so, what are the reasons for it?  My own theory is that a conservative religious background could cause scientifically minded students to be more attracted to engineering than the sciences due to science's association with liberalism and atheism, but I haven't done any great research into that.

Simply put, I can't believe (or am not comfortable with believing) that a majority of the people building bridges and nuclear reactors might seriously consider creationism valid science.  

Does the field within engineering have anything to do with it?  I can see why someone working for a defense contractor would lean a bit more to the right since obviously their job depends on a pro-military political climate or why a petroleum engineering working for an energy multinational would be skeptical of climate change, but I can't fathom what might cause electronics or computer engineers to be more socially or religiously conservative than the rest of the population.",AskEngineers,Rifter519,/r/AskEngineers/comments/27rgje/engineers_more_conservative/

27,Question about the feasibility of crude position control of pneumatic cylinder,1402288478,"So as my post says, I'm trying to see if getting a position control of a double acting pneumatic cylinder is possible. Essentially, my idea is to use a line of compressed air going into both ports of the cylinder, and each cylinder has a ""drain"" which is basically a flow rate control valve. 

I tried calculating this out on paper and realized I don't know hardly anything about fluid dynamics. I will learn everything I need to know to work on this project, I just want to know if it is even possible before I invest much time into it. I came up with a crude sketch here: http://imgur.com/1PHOOJl . Based on the compressor I get, I can set the pressure at some value (say 100psi). I can also regulate the outlet flow rate. Now, the inlet flow rate is going to be dependent on the pressure difference between the inside of the box and the inlet? I'm sure there is an equation somewhere. Then, based on what I know already, I figured that the pressure inside the box could be calculated by finding the total mass of air inside (from the inlet and outlet flow rate), and dividing that mass by the surface area inside the box (and converting lbm to lbf) to get pressure. Is that correct? 

Then I came up with this crude sketch: http://imgur.com/iJLZCfZ which shows the simple pneumatic cylinder. If I applied my math from the previous paragraph, I could determine the forces applied to the actuated rod and then get acceleration. This works in theory, right? 

Obviously if this project is feasible, I will use pressure sensors and actual flow-rate sensors and possible a linear encoder to get a slightly more precise positioning system (I'm shooting for 0.125""). Like I said, I just want to know how feasible it is and perhaps suggestions on which part of fluid dynamics to start looking into.

  I'm making some changes on an old International Scout, and I've reached a bit of an impasse with spring selection.  No one really makes springs for this application, and the few that are out there won't work with the vehicle / axle combo I'm putting together. For those of you who aren't aware, it's leaf sprung, solid axle front and rear.

I've got the frame and axles drawn up in Sketchup (it gets me by), so I can guesstimate ride height based on rate and arch of the spring.  So while I can pick out a spring that will sit where I want it to, I'm not sure how to determine what the best rate is for the weight of the vehicle.  I don't want to end up with something that slams off the bump stops every time I go over a bump, but I don't want it any stiffer than it needs to be.

Is there a rule of thumb for dynamic loads on springs or something that I can calculate that will get me in the ballpark?  I've tentatively settled on some 325lb/in springs meant for a Wrangler because they're the right arch to get the height I want and a length that will fit. If it helps, the Scout has about 2000 lbs on the axle. With these springs I'll have about 5"" of uptravel and about 5200 lbs of spring load when the axle hits the bump stops.

43,"Need help with DIY boombox, need a way to store settings.",1402208370,"Hey guys,

I'm designing, and will be fabricating soon, a DIY Boombox using a 12V PSU from a computer, a head unit, and some speakers. But just now, I realized something, since the box will operate solely using the PSU power, which will require it being plugged into 120V AC wall outlets, there won't be anything to store the settings stored in the head unit.

My first problem is I need a way, preferably a small and lightweight solution, to all me to store settings, and to be able to keep that battery charged without needing to tear the box apart to change or access the battery. I can't find how many mA the HU would draw to store settings, but it can't be much. The smallest 12V solution I can find would be an A23 battery, but I can't find a rechargeable one, and I would worry about it not lasting very long. Having some sort of A23 circuit and holder mounted to the back of the box would be alright, if replacing the batteries is the only option available.

My second problem is that I'm confused about if I could even put a battery backup inline in the power circuits without it blowing stuff up. A typical HU has constant power from the battery to the red wire, and ignition power feeds the yellow remote power button, signaling the HU to draw from the red. I guess I'm planning on just wiring the remote input of my HU to the red constant 12V power from my PSU, unless you have any better ideas. But I'm perplexed about how to wire a battery backup into the circuit in a way that would allow it to store settings but not leave the HU on, draining the battery with standby or powered on amperage draw.

I'm a little frustrated, because I thought I had thought of everything, and was ready to begin. But now I've remembered this detail, and realize I still have a major hurdle in front of me. Any help you could provide would be appreciated.

46,"A few questions on selecting a motor and battery, and on whether or not to use capacitors for regenerative breaking.",1402195465,"Hello fellow engineers,

I am trying to design and build an electric drive system for a scooter/moped. I figure it will be easier to convert an existing scoot/moped to run on batteries and electric motor, although I would like to make a custom frame eventually but that is another topic.

I need help with the electrical design at the moment.
First, I need advice on selecting a motor. DC seems most reasonable as the scoot will be battery powered and converting to AC is adding complexity.
I think a 1 HP DC motor ought to be enough power for 350-400lbs to get up to 30 mph.
Example specs for a motor I found online are: 90V DC, 36.0 in lbs of torque, and 1750 rpm.

Would this be enough power/torque for this application?

What kind of motor driver would I use to power the motor? is PWM suitable for this application? if 90V DC is the rated voltage of the motor, how should I step up the voltage if it is all DC?  should I stack the batteries voltage in series or keep in parallel and use a buck/boost converter?

That brings me to battery selection. is a bunch of 12V lead acid batteries the most reasonable for this? or one large 12V lead acid?
h li-ion, ni-cad and ni-mh seem unreasonable for this application due to their cost and availability in specific sizes.

My next consideration is that whatever motor I select, back-emf from the motor will have to be dissipated as heat or put back into the battery. This is where I was considering using capacitors to help offset the sudden load on the battery/ help offset the energy requirements on starting up from stop. Are supercapacitors suitable for this application? and are they relatively commercially available? how would I go about sizing the capacitor?

That is all the questions I have for now. I have some background in electrical and mechanical but I am not familiar with this type of power system.

50,"Puzzle: Need help with micro-robotic design, mainly actuators for gravity fed motion.",1402179703,"Hello, first time poster here, I was directed to this sub by robotics people, so if there is a better place, please met me know!

**Brief Description:** I have blocks set at 25 degree angle that needs to be released electronically. Right now, I have a pager motor with 90 degree shaft acting as a pin to hold the block up. When activated, this pin rotates out of the way, and the block falls. (great!) Most of the time, this works without issue, so I'm happy with the design in that it works most of the time and was easy to build. 

[Here is the setup: IMAGES](http://imgur.com/a/BYfu0)

**Problems:** If the block's angle is at off from perpendicular in the direction of shaft rotation , then this setup would require the shaft to move the block upwards, which stalls the motor. On a higher level, I realize I am supporting the partial weight of the block on the motor shaft, and I feel like there should be a solution where the motor acts purely as an actuator without supporting the weight. 

**Conditions:**

* I'm 3dprinting or PCL forming everything myself, so simplicity is key. I realize I could have a complex system of gears / axels to use beefier motors elsewhere, however imho this would be too complex for me to quickly prototype. I'm open to suggestions, but just keep in mind I'm a hobbyist. Something I could hand form with PCL would be WAY better than needing to special order micro-gears I'd have to glue on. 

* Prefer to not use beefier motors. Geared pager motors jump from $2 to $11-$15, which would drastically drive up cost, since 8+ are used. Since I'm placing them in each ""tray"" rather than using more complex system, even bigger gear-less motors would be detrimental. 

* Size is key, if I could figure out an EASY way to mount the motor on the side to reduce the vertical size of each tray, that would be helpful, as long as the resulting complexity is still easily built at home. 

**Possible Solution**: I considered mounting the motor at say a 5 degree angle, which I think would be more rotation than the block would be capable of. Haven't tried it yet because I think there is a better mechanical solution rather than a bandaid, so thats why I'm here. 

Additionally, it looks like these are generally 1.5v-3v motors, but the specsheet has data for running them at 6v. I'm currently running them at 5v, however since they only need to be run for 200-500ms at a time, could I simply over-volt these to like 9v or 12v, if it would make them beefy enough to move the block up slightly? Not sure if overheating would still be an issue since they aren't being run for even 1second at a time.



I'm also open to using solenoids or other forms of actuators, just couldn't figure out a good system as I'm clueless on mechanical engineering.

60,Measuring pump performance?,1402100562,"I've got a generic chinese submersible water pump. I've also got a BMW windshield wiper pump.

Both of them run at 12 VDC, both were tested with no outlet hose, with fully saturated impellers.

The wiper pulls 2.0 amps at 12 VDC but has much a smaller diameter output, and is physically half or less the size of the submersible. It doesn't ""look"" like it flows as much, but eyes can be deceiving.

Is it ""reasonable"" to presume that a higher amperage motor is going to push more water? Or is a smaller diameter impeller much less efficient?

Lastly, when pushing water against a static medium, such as the ocean/lake from a nozzle: What's the most important factor for imparting force? Escape velocity, like a rocket? Or is the incompressible medium enough that ""energy is energy"" so faster + less flow = slower + more flow?

It's been forever since I've had my fluids classes--or I was getting my degree! The goal here is to 1) learn, and 2) find a relatively cheap means of pushing water while fully submerged for an RC submarine prototype.

The design only needs a 1 to 2 rpm motion and the current motor/design is doing 30 and wearing out the 1.5v AA quickly.    Servos, USB power, arduino all solve the issues except for simplicity and cost.   

I was also thinking solenoid but with some sort of really simple circuit that fires the solenoid at 1 to 2 rpm.

Any advice/ideas for me?

85,A strangely vague question: What are the various advantages/disadvantages of Photocatalytic Water Splitting versus Photovoltaics?,1402009177,"In a way, I have already found an answer, but I am curious to see others' input. 

Here are my various compiled advantages/disadvantages:

**Photocatalytic**

*Advantages*

Direct conversion of sunlight into easily stored medium

Storage medium is easily used for already established methods for power generation (Burn Hydrogen to heat water to make steam to spin turbine)

Storage medium also has other uses (Whatever else Hydrogen is used for other than Power Generation, i.e. Rocketry)

*Disadvantages*

Expensive (requires either co-doping with precious metals or particular conditions)

Degradation of catalysts is a big issue (Oxygen radicals quickly oxidize the catalysts, so either you deal with it or use alternate measures)

Not easily adapted to home use (For electrical energy, you would need a fuel cell or, less practically, a steam turbine. Also storage is a big issue for home use, since tanks for Hydrogen need to be big to supply enough Hydrogen to power a house)

Generally finicky (Most catalysts need short wavelengths to even work, ruling out most of the solar energy in the irradiance spectra. Also, with the more commercially viable nanorods, incidence angle plays a huge role. On top of all that, the aforementioned nanorods need to be grown on an expensive monocrystalline substrate (At least, according to current research). There is also the possibility of using CdS doped Titania, but that degrades quickly)

**Photovoltaics**

*Advantages*

Cheap (Can use polycrystalline Silicon)

Very easy to make (Requires no precious metals and no overly extreme conditions. Also modular, making for easier assembly/repair)

Easy to install (In an oversimplified summary, you essentially plug it in and it works)

Well-established (This is less of an advantage, and more a result of being around for longer)

Uses entire spectrum (Does not require blue light or higher energy to function)

*Disadvantages*

Provides no direct storage (Converting to chemical energy (Batteries) creates inefficiencies)

Generally Lower Quantum Efficiency (Overall commercial efficiencies for PV are ~15% with the high end at ~28%. Overall efficiencies for PCWS are ~20% with the high end at ~35%)

*************************************************

As you can probably tell, this list is not perfect. One of the biggest areas of ""controversy"" (not real controversy, I just can't find two sources that agree with each other), is the power densities of the two technologies. I cannot even find a baseline power density for either, so that would be helpful.

Finally, I would like to thank you all in advance for what I'm sure will be great, informative comments. In addition, I would like to apologize for the probable circumstance that this is not the correct subreddit for such a vague question.

We have a jig that pushes depressors into the skin which allows accurate superficial scanning, but being able to scan through the depressors and model the skin impressions directly would be *very convenient*. I have tried Polycarbonate, but the scanners still find ~1/4 of the depressor's volume.

The depressors will be flat panels with beveled edges that make full contact with the skin. Very high transmittance and low diffraction over the flat impressed area is important to model an accurate depth of the skin impressions, and accurate scanning of the [beveled edges](https://www.google.com/search?q=bevel&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS562US562&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2uyQU7z4JIuRyAT52YFY&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=_P3znH7iwnKy8M%253A%3BSwwDPRhIh2zWFM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcdn0.sbnation.com%252Fimported_assets%252F1056526%252FBevel__28PSF_29.png%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.barkingcarnival.com%252F2012%252F4%252F30%252F2990032%252Fbevel-vs-bevo-which-will-be-a-bigger-rival%3B749%3B534) would very useful as well.

Obviously, as a new hire, I've basically only been doing electronic training for the past week, but now I've completed all my training I can do without people. I'm working on asking my boss who to contact for the rest of the training, but like most bosses, he's kinda hard to find as he always is in one meeting or another. 

I don't currently really have a mentor, although from time to time someone has sat down with me to explain how the product works.

At this point, I just don't know what the protocol is. I still don't know anything, being fresh out of school, but I also can't really learn much more in theory. I don't have any work currently assigned to me, and I don't know what work will be assigned to me in the future, so I can't really try to start learning stuff that will be helpful, because I don't know what will be helpful!

What type of positions or work did you obtain with this degree?

Is this program respected by oil &amp; gas companies or in other words is this degree even worth the expense of 10 courses @ $3000 per course?

Any personal input/opinions on that actual program and workload itself is also appreciated.

21,"Hunting for hydraulic filter ""accessory.""",1401897349,"I pitched this same question to /r/whatisthisthing last week with no leads. Here's another attempt.

I have been searching up and down to replace the black and white rings found in [these](http://imgur.com/a/iOmiL) pictures. The entire assembly is a filter component of a hydraulic system. We recently replaced our filters, and one of the black rings broke when it was dropped and another white ring showed signs that it was degrading. 

The tall canister which is still wrapped in foil is the filter element (Outer diameter is approx 2.84""). We already have plenty of these, fortunately.

The black ring (Outer diameter measures to 2.97"", Inner to 2.125"", height of 0.6"") is a magnetic element which works to prevent metal filings from entering pumps and valves. 

The white ring (Outer of ~2.125"", Inner of 1.56"", and height of 0.625"") is just a plastic spacer which keeps everything concentric once it has been installed in the [filter head](http://westechequipment.com/bmz_cache/5/500198c7df66581976471e5ea511ee01.image.200x200.gif).

There are no significant markings identifying where it is from, or a part number. 

We have already worked very hard with our normal parts distributor (Parker) to find anything about this, but it's been a wash so far. I can't locate any receipts for these items, either.

I currently work for a Telecommunications Engineering firm and my boss asked me to look into getting us tablets. 

The functions that we would need with the tablet would be:

* Performing site surveys. This includes taking measurements and lots of pictures(Medium/High Quality). Also the ability to take notes while at the site itself.

* We would like a function where we can draw on CAD files. We don't need the CAD file itself to be touched on the tablet. Perhaps a PDF of the CAD file where we can draw on it and make markings.

* Some sort of Word/Excel compatibility or anything similar that could be transferred to the computer when we're back in office.

32,Question about my boss and my internship.,1401843365,"I have become unhappy with the type of work that I am doing and I don't really know how to approach my boss with this concern, or if I should even talk to him about it at all.  I am a few classes away from finishing my degree and have been an intern at a small engineering firm for two and a half years.  At this point I believe I have gradually been pigeon holed into the role of an office administrator.  I literally do nothing but make copies and scan things.  I can't remember the last time I did any actual engineering work.  It has gotten to the point that the office administrator is now who I am supposed to go to for assignments when I get to work in the morning. 

I didn't mind doing this kind of work when I first started because I was a sophomore and really hadn't gotten to the core engineering classes yet.  But I am at a point now where I have to think about employment after graduation, and I feel like putting a 3 and a half year engineering internship on my resume is about as useful as putting a 3 and a half year job at Kinkos on my resume if the only real skill I learned while there is how to make lots of copies very quickly.  There are other interns and they rarely if ever have to do this type of work, it just all goes to me automatically because I have been there longer and already know how to do it quickly and correctly.

I feel like I am well like around the office for several reasons, for one they have kept me around for an unusually long time.  I have also had several people tell me they appreciate how hard I work and even received a pay raise after performance reviews last year.  For these reasons I don't think I'm intentionally being given menial copy jobs all week, I think people are just used to me being the copy person.  

I have become very frustrated with this work lately, mostly because I seem to be the only intern that ever does this much of it.  I certainly wouldn't mind doing some of it, but it would be nice if I didn't spend 40 hours a week in the copy room while the other interns are at their desks gaining valuable CAD experience or actually learning how to be an engineer.  I really just want to learn something.  I have never approached my boss with anything like this before and I am looking for some advice on how to bring this issue up with him.",AskEngineers,_bob_rob_,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2792ym/question_about_my_boss_and_my_internship/
33,"tubine a/r and mass flow, why does it work?",1401842981,"I work with turbochargers on cars all the time.  Building performance vehicles is a huge hobby of mine, and hopefully soon, a profession.   But I have a question regarding turbo turbine housing a/r and flow.

I'm going to use generic numbers because I think that's enough to get a generalized response.  I'm not looking for exact numbers, but a more concrete understanding of why I'm seeing the results I am.

Lets say I have a 2.0l engine with 10:1 compression.  The turbo I have strapped to the motor is a 60/80mm compressor, 85/70 turbine.  Using a t3 flange, which has an inlet are of roughly 4.3sq inches.  With a boost pressure of 20psi and engine speed of 7000rpm, using a turbine:

* .48 a/r, I spool at 3500rpm with 30psi drive pressure. 
* .63 a/r, I spool at 4500rpm with 25psi drive pressure.
* .82 a/r, I spool at 5500rpm with 20psi drive pressure.

Obviously, the smaller the a/r, the smaller the volute.  The lower drive pressure results in the same mass flow through the turbine wheel.  But the nozzle diameter inside the housing remains unchanged.  Not only this, but the bigger housing doesn't become a restriction until the total system mass flow increases proportionately to the increase in volute size.  Drive pressure increases as mass flow increases, but a larger volute can flow more mass flow through the same nozzle size as compared to the smaller volute.

How does using a larger turbine housing maintain the same flow through the turbine wheel when the pressure differential across the wheel is lower? OR How does using a larger volute allow for more flow through the turbine wheel when drive pressures remain the same.",AskEngineers,three_word_reply,/r/AskEngineers/comments/2792ev/tubine_ar_and_mass_flow_why_does_it_work/

39,Graphically expressing large amounts of data,1401810997,"Hi Reddit Engineers,

I'm hoping you can help me solve this problem at my internship. I work for a biotech company and we want to graphically represent the data from one of our machines (Agilent Bravo). It's pretty much a machine with 96 heads (or 384) that picks up pipet tips and aspirates/disperses fluid. 

So each head/well has it's own value for quality control testing. I.E. the well in column 20, row E gives a value of 9.1 (ideal value is 9.9). We want to track the values for every well in the head (96 or 384) and put the info in a line graph. Once we see the linear line have a dip or depreciation, we can predict with some certainty that the well is going bad. 

Obviously if we go in excel and  create a graph with one well (i.e. Column 20, Row E) we can visually see a linear line (assuming its a good head) and then once a well goes bad, we'll see a dip/depreciation that will show perfectly a well going bad. But the question is how to reproduce this if there are 96 wells (or 384) we are trying to watch.

/r/AskEngineers and other similar subreddits often receive questions from people looking for guidance in the field of engineering. Is this degree right for me? How do I become a ___ engineer? What’s a good project to start learning with? While simple at heart, these questions are a gateway to a vast amount of information.

Each Monday, I’ll be posting a new thread aimed at the community to help us answer these questions for everyone. Anyone can post, but the goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses will be compiled into a wiki for everyone to use and hopefully give guidance to our fellow upcoming engineers and hopefuls.
***

**Post Formatting**    

***

To help both myself and anyone reading your answers, I’d like if everyone could follow the format below. The example used will be my own.

Field: Electrical Engineering – RF Subsystems    
Specialization (optional): Attenuators    
Experience: 2 years

[Post details here]


This formatting will help us in a few ways. Later on, when we start combining disciplines into a single thread, it will allow us to separate responses easily. The addition of specialization and experience also allows the community to follow up with more directed questions.
***
To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions for everyone. Answer as much as you want, or write up completely different questions and answers.

* What inspired you to become a Petroleum Engineer?    
* Why did you choose your specialization?    
* What school did you choose and why should I go there?    
* I’m still in High School, but I think I want to be a Petroleum Engineer. How do I know for sure?    
* What’s your favorite project you’ve worked on in college or in your career?    
* What’s it like during a normal day for you?


We’ve gotten plenty of questions like this in the past, so feel free to take inspiration from those posts as well. Just post whatever you feel is useful!

More to the point, I'm interested in how it *could have* been done, historically. Obviously, today, the ""practical"" way of doing this would be to use a battery, but then, if we're talking about practical thing is to just get a quartz watch to begin with! I'm also not interested in things like nano-spring mechanical memory, which would clearly be beyond the capabilities of a traditional watchmaker. So far, I have only been able to find a few types of mechanical energy storage: springs, compressed air, and flywheels. Springs are what are already used, so there isn't much to discuss. Compressed air seems promising, except that I'm not sure how small you could realistically make compressed air tanks, and ""winding"" the watch up might be rather difficult. Flywheels, while conceptually simpler, probably would be less useful due to the self-discharge time. Since we're not using electricity, you necessarily need mechanical contact (so any sort of magnetic bearings are out), and in at the scale of a watch you could probably only use plain bearings.

Are there any other ways one could theoretically do this?

67,What's the best metal for the simple mechanisms found in woodwind musical instruments?,1401650879,"Apologies if I have come to the wrong place or framed the question improperly.  I have no engineering knowledge at all.

I am wondering what metal(s), in the opinion of an engineer, would be ideal for the simple mechanisms found in woodwind instruments.

Some photos of what I'm talking about: [oboe keys](http://i.imgur.com/YZ7m88B.jpg?1) , [flute keys](http://i.imgur.com/huObDe8.jpg)

Traditionally, the rods that keys are mounted on (invisible in the photos) are steel, while the posts (drilled into the wood, or soldered onto the body in the case of metal instruments), tubing, key arms and cups are either in sterling silver, silver plated nickel-silver (copper, nickel, zinc), or silver plated brass (usually in larger instruments.)  Usually the tubing, arms and cups are cast and/or machined separately and hard soldered together by hand.

Some newer designs are using stainless steel for the posts, key arms and cups, and those companies claim that this is more stable/durable than traditional silver or plated nickel-silver. [picture](http://i.imgur.com/Fr65GZu.jpg) . I'm wondering if this is likely true, and also whether aluminum (or any other metal for that matter) would be a good/better choice.

There are some that say that the metal choice has an impact on the sound of the instrument, but I am mainly interested in mechanical properties.  Durability is a major concern, as instruments get bumped quite a bit in use.  Also smoothness/quickness of action.  The springs (which move the keys back to their original position after pressed) are usually blued spring steel, sometimes stainless steel, silver or gold.

The ventilation is not very good and the windows are the kind that tilt open on the lower side. It's a rental so I can't make any changes to the house.

My idea is to pump out the hottest air by the ceiling and thereby lower the overall temperature and to use 12 cm fans for computer cases. The reason for computer fans are that they are inexpensive and most of all quiet. I was hoping to eventually hook to the fans to solar panels in the window so that the very energy that heats the rooms up is used to cool them down. 

While doing some testing, I realised that the fans that have a big performance in cm^2 /minute have a very low pressure (?), so while efficient in an unobstructed case, they are garbage at pumping air  through a tube. 

I don't know anything about air flow or remember much from school physics, so I kindly ask you guys for advice. 

Would this work? Any ideas on how or what fans to use? Could I chain a few fans in series? Or is this just a bad idea?

I'm a pretty decent avr programmer but I'm only a hack of an engineer, so I'd like to do this with off the shelf components rather than a mechanism I have to machine or 3D print (Though if I have to go there, I know a guy).

The power quality is not all that stable with frequency and voltage issues.  I'm trying to power a computer lab, and I'm worried that the laptop power supplies will suffer if the power fluctuates a lot. 

We will most likely burn out the laptop power supplies, and they may be cheap enough to simply replace as needed, but cleaner AC might be a good strategy to mitigate damage.  Some devices like projectors have no user replaceable power supplies.

My question is, should I go for a Power Conditioning Unit like this (For 220v) http://www.amazon.com/Tripp-Lite-LC1200-Conditioner-Outlet/dp/B0000512LA or is there a circuit based where I can power condition the whole room at once.  There may be efficiency in design, by conditioning the whole circuit; rather than having 4-5 of the AVRs around.

1,Building simple temperature controller. Need an EE,1401395510,"I'm a physics student and a temperature controller we use in our lab just died.  The device puts a small current across a Si diode and reads the out the voltage drop.  It then matches this voltage to a calibration curve and displays a temperature.  It allows you to set a desired temperature and outputs a current to a simple ohmic heater. Or at least it used to before it died. A new replacement controller is frankly out of our price range and we haven't had much luck finding working used models on ebay (this thing was new in the 70's).  I also haven't been able to find the broken components in our current controller.

How hard would it be to make a replacement device?  I'm thinking of using an arduino as its core.  I can use it to read the voltage drop across the diode.  If the the drop is higher then some set threshold, then output current through an amplifier to the ohmic heater.  It keeps reading voltages and turns off the heater when the voltage drop is lower then the threshold.  Wash rinse repeat.

A little background: I grew up in a 20+ story apartment building in New York, and remember (quite fondly) that it would take less than a second for the hot water to kick in when I turned on my shower. The water pressure was strong and constant, and could run for hours without going tepid. 

Yet thinking back on it now, I'm wondering how the hot water could have gotten to my apartment (along with hundreds of others) in a cost-effective manner. Presumably, water from the building's water tower would be siphoned into a centralized water heater, which would be connected by pipes to various bathrooms and kitchens in the building... but how close would the heater have to be to any given apartment for it to arrive so quickly? I'm guessing there must be multiple heaters, and well insulated pipes, but even then it seems that the cost of heating up so large a volume of water at so many different locations in the building would be enormous.

13,Help with splitting signal from external antenna,1401341258,"I'm hoping someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong. I'm in Australia so I'm not sure if my terms will be familiar so if I've called something by the wrong name please let me know.

I have an external antenna for the standard over-the-air Digital TV channels broadcast in Australia. In my garage, the coax cable from the antenna drops through the ceiling and into a hole in the wall to a socket faceplate in the loungeroom on the other side of the wall.

I've just installed a TV in the garage and wanted to split the signal coming from the external antenna.

I've purchased a 2-way coax splitter (5-2450MHz, with female F-type connectors) and a bunch of screw-on F-type connectors. I then cut the coax cable, stripped each end of the existing cable run, attached the screw-on F-type connectors, and installed and tested the splitter. So far so good.

I then take a standard TV fly lead (75ohm PAL Belling-Lee type connectors), stick a male F-type connector to male Belling-Lee PAL connector adaptor on the end of the fly lead and hook it up to the splitter. I run the other end to the new TV in the garage, and attempt to tune in the channels.

This is where things go astray. I can't seem to get any channels whatsoever. Thinking that perhaps the fly lead was faulty I went and removed the fly lead from the tested and working loungeroom TV and test it on the TV in the garage. Same thing - no channels will tune in. Then I thought maybe it was the connector on the splitter so I swapped the 2 outputs around. The loungeroom TV still happily has signal and channels, the garage TV still won't tune any in. So then I replace the F-type connector to PAL connector adaptor and test it all again with the same result.

I'm no electronics guru and am struggling with ideas on what is wrong. Thinking that maybe it was the TV itself, I bring in another TV and tuner and try the same tests on a different set of devices. Same result.

Is there any possibility that the signal coming from the antenna requires some sort of conversion before being suitable for the TV aerial connection? Is this something that might normally be part of the electronics in the wall plate? Because I'm basically going straight from the antenna, through the splitter and direct into the back of the TV - no wall socket or any other equipment that might convert an incompatible signal type. The wall socket in the loungeroom is inaccessible so I can't remove it and check what smarts it might have built in.

I'm after suggestions or comments that might help get this sorted out. I'm a bit baffled at the moment and would appreciate any assistance anyone might have.

I forgot to mention that both TVs are identical and the TV in the loungeroom is on the longer run of cable but works fine. The TV in the garage which is closer is unable to tune.

My understanding is that whatever strength the signal is going into the splitter, each output is 50% on a 2-way splitter, maybe 40% after loss. 40-50% of the original signal is enough for 1 of the 2 identical TVs to tune in, but not enough for the other.

The software and hardware (other than homemade antennas) I can handle, its the physics of waves and how antennas works is a mystery to me.

Okay, so I am trying to extend a point to point WiFi connections (two routers with removable antennas, using short N-connector cables) and the easiest solutions seem to be building either a biquad, or double biquad antennas, mounted to TV satellite dishes. I'll be frank by saying I had no clue what these were up until a couple hours ago... so if there is a different antenna that is easier/better to make that will go a further distance let me know.

So questions about these antennas (keeping in mind I am not a professional antenna builder):

* How far do you think a pair of home made biquad or double biquad antenna could reach with a 20"" tv satellite dish? (one antenna w/ dish per point)
* what kind of latency would be added going these distances with these antennas? at 22km or around the maximum distance.

Thanks, if this seems like a viable project, I will definitely share my build and test results if anyone is interested.

EDIT: Thanks all for your time. I see there was confusion over what I had planned, but my inspiration was from  the article /u/crazedover linked: http://www.wifi-toys.com/wi-fi.php?a=articles&amp;id=91 which stated an unamplified 802.11b connection was made over 125 miles. Having access to 18"" satellite dishes and no issues of LOS (other than the curvature of the earth) I thought this may have been possible, however 10M high mounting points, the Fresnel zone (mentioned by /u/nephors) sounds like barriers I cannot overcome.",AskEngineers,fpsrandy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/26oafc/trying_to_extend_wifi_using_homemade_antenna/

34,Electrical / battery question,1401254395,"I want to use a series of VFDs connected to a common DC bus, to drive a number of 440VAC motors. I also want to alternatively supply the bus either with one or more generators through appropriate rectifier units, or (not concurrently) through a battery bank connected directly to the DC bus. The battery bank is rated nominal 647 VDC, max 750 VDC, so if I use a 460 VAC generator, the peak bus voltage matches the battery spec; however, when I want to use the generator to recharge the battery after extended battery operation, the maximum voltage on the bus would only be the battery nominal voltage, so I'm wondering if that is sufficient for charging in a deep cycle application (LiFePO4), or if the charge voltage must be higher than the nominal supply voltage to charge the batteries properly and attain the rated life?

Can I do this at all, or do I need dedicated voltage and current controlled charging hardware operating disconnected from the drive bus?

36,What is the most technically ignorant comment you have had to face as an engineer?,1401246378,"I think every engineer (or just educated individuals) has been faced with the occasional abysmal lack of basic physics knowledge. I am curious to know your stories.

For others, I may be curious to hear your defense.

For example, what brought this to mind was an altercation I had a few years ago. I had proposed adjusting the clamping pressure of a 60 ton rubber mold and studying the results to understand its effects. A 60+ year old woman (with a 4 year ME or IE degree) berated my idea and quote "" That is the stupidest idea ever. Don't you understand that hot rubber is an in-compressible fluid!"" 

We run study's all the time and she would have had no extra work by my proposal. She truly believed that I was an idiot! 

Not only was I pissed to just deal with this bitch, but not a single engineer in the room had the balls or knowledge to back me up that all fluids are compressible. My argument back was simply that mercury is a fluid and it only needs a small amount of heat to expand in a thermometer...  so what is going on in a +160C mold under a few tons of pressure.

I got to do my study and led to a complete change in how we set ourselves up now, because it worked. (thank god! :) )

What really depressed me was telling my father (an engineer w/o degree) the story later. His first comment was an interruption where he stated that fluids are in-compressible. {face-palm}

Sorry about the week off, bit of a busy week and I didn't get a chance to hop on for this post!

Previous threads are linked at the bottom.

**What is this post?**
***
/r/AskEngineers and other similar subreddits often receive questions from people looking for guidance in the field of engineering. Is this degree right for me? How do I become a ___ engineer? What’s a good project to start learning with? While simple at heart, these questions are a gateway to a vast amount of information.

Each Monday, I’ll be posting a new thread aimed at the community to help us answer these questions for everyone. Anyone can post, but the goal is to have engineers familiar with the subjects giving their advice, stories, and collective knowledge to our community. The responses will be compiled into a wiki for everyone to use and hopefully give guidance to our fellow upcoming engineers and hopefuls.
***

**Post Formatting**    

***

To help both myself and anyone reading your answers, I’d like if everyone could follow the format below. The example used will be my own.

Field: Electrical Engineering – RF Subsystems    
Specialization (optional): Attenuators    
Experience: 2 years

[Post details here]


This formatting will help us in a few ways. Later on, when we start combining disciplines into a single thread, it will allow us to separate responses easily. The addition of specialization and experience also allows the community to follow up with more directed questions.
***
To help inspire responses and start a discussion, I will pose a few common questions for everyone. Answer as much as you want, or write up completely different questions and answers.

* What inspired you to become an Aerospace Engineer?    
* Why did you choose your specialization?    
* What school did you choose and why should I go there?    
* I’m still in High School, but I think I want to be an Aerospace Engineer. How do I know for sure?    
* What’s your favorite project you’ve worked on in college or in your career?    
* What’s it like during a normal day for you?


We’ve gotten plenty of questions like this in the past, so feel free to take inspiration from those posts as well. Just post whatever you feel is useful!

41,At what point am I selling myself short when it comes to entry level salaries?,1401219434,"I interviewed with 2 companies over the phone last week and told my expectations were $40-$50k. I knew this was below average for entry level mechanical engineers (which is $55-65k) but one company seems pretty small (couldn't find a thing about them online) and glassdoor.com told me managers at the other only made $48-52k. I'm semi expecting an offer from the small company sometime this week. 

I got bored yesterday and threw together a rough budget based on a few different starting salaries. The worst case scenario, $40k, would let me save around $1k/month after everything is paid for, including a $273 student loan payment. That's not including any retirement savings either. It doesn't seem like much to me. And there are some pressing purchases I need to make too (my laptop barely functions at this point). It would be difficult to save much and tacking on another 5k (which seems like a lot to me) to the salary only adds a few hundred more a month. 

It gets even harder for me to accept this when you consider that the average starting salary for a [history major](http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2013/02/06/starting-salary-liberal-arts-grads/) is like $42k. Nothing against history majors but come on. And then I look at what my friends are making. Two guys are making 66k, another 63k, and one or two in the mid 50s. 

Another concern I have is getting stuck in a ""salary hole"" for a long time. I've heard that accepting a low salary will follow you because employers know you will work for less than average. I really don't want to start my career off in a hole like that.

I'd like a fairly heavy stone cover for my fire pit but I don't want to deal with needing multiple people to lift it and move it.

So I was reading in /r/science about an experiment coming up where energy will be converted into mass, and in the process, I ended up wondering about a hypothetical device that could convert generic mass to energy completely and with a high efficiency.

I'm imagining a hypothetical where science determines a way to change arbitrary mass (ie. you don't need to put some special plutonium isotope in, just any old atoms) into its equivalent in energy -- for convenience, we'll say electrical energy. I understand that physics doesn't work that way, but let's just say for the sake of argument it did. I'm also assuming for the sake of our hypothetical that it would be inexpensive to produce such devices.

What do you think the consequences of such a device being available would be? How would our economy world-wide be affected? How would humanity's aims be affected? Would some environmental problems go away? Do you think new environmental problems would arise? What challenges do you think the human race would face given such a device? Would it affect how different societies on earth ran? How about the condition of different cross-sections of humanity -- how would their lives be different?

I plan on continuing my education, but I'm torn between doing a PhD program (in Astronomy, Astrophysics, Cosmology, etc.) or if I should go for my masters in something like Aerospace engineering. 

I made a pros and cons list to try to make my decision. 
Pros for engineering: If I were to choose engineering, the program would be significantly shorter, I would receive a higher income, and I would have more flexibility on my job choice and location in my career.
Cons: There was only one con I could come up with. Engineering may not be exactly what I want to do. But as I haven't really taken any engineering classes, I have no way of knowing that for sure.
Pros for a PhD: It would be something I love and I know I'm interested in.
Cons: I would be in school for several more years. I would make less money. My job opportunities in my field would be more limited, and there is a real chance that I would wind up teaching as a professor(Something I know does not interest me). 

So I guess my question(s) is/are this: What career choices would I have with a BS in Astrophysics and a Masters in Aerospace? What type of work would I be doing? Would it be more mechanics based?

You can answer how you prefer: a few questions, only a section, or all three. Any responses, advice, etc. would be awesome!

**Topic 1: Stereotypes and Personalities**

* What is a ""stereotypical"" engineer? 

* Have you encountered this stereotype? Do you fit the stereotype?

* What kind of personality is best suited to engineering?

* Choose four MBTI personality indicators you think are most prevalent in engineers

1

introversion (I) (interest flowing mainly to the inner world of concepts and ideas)

extraversion (E) (interest flowing mainly to the outer world of actions, objects, and persons)

2

sensing (S) (tending to perceive immediate, real, practical facts of experience and life)

intuition (N) (tending to perceive possibilities, relationships, and meanings of experiences)

3

thinking (T) (tending to make judgments or decisions objectively and impersonally)

feeling (F) (tending to make judgments subjectively and personally)

4

judging (J) (tending to live in a planned and decisive way)

perceiving (P) (tending to live in a spontaneous and flexible way).



**Topic 2: Man vs Woman Divide**

* Why do you think there is a historical divide between men and women in engineering?

* What is your opinion of woman engineers? Do you know only a few, or many?

* Do you think woman engineers think they have do more to ""prove"" themselves?

* If you could change something about how women are viewed as engineers vs men what would you do?

**Topic 3: Different Branches**

* Why did you choose the branch you're in? 

* Do you regret this choice, or wish you had chosen a different branch?

* Is there any major difference in personality between the branches of engineering or is it rather homogeneous?  

* Which branch do you think is the most challenging? The least? Did you choose one of these?

Here are two simple systems for air supply: Standalone air compressor and air supply in the shop with pressure regulator.

Both systems were placed in the same height elevation and connected with the same diameter of tube. 

The compressor was set to 12VDC and was connected with a pressure gauge and a flow meter. The measurement was 10 psig with flow rate of 1.0 GPM.

With the same set-up, instead of using air compressor, shop air with a pressure regulator was used and the pressure regulator was set to 10 psig. However, the flow rate was 0.5 GPM. 

Half of the flow rate compared with the air compressor. Does this mean that the regulator actually restrict the flow rate? If that's the case, will I be able to recreate the same air supply condition as the air compressor?

78,Question about using a spring to support a mobile platform,1400974756,"So I am working on designing a 6DOF Stewart Platform based motion simulator, and I have a question about my preliminary design. I made a quick sketch of my idea, I apologize for the poor drawing skills; I would have made a CAD model but I didn't want to waste unnecessary time if the concept doesn't work. Anyways, my post will reference this image: http://imgur.com/Lu7z9Sy. In case you don't know what a Stewart Platform is, here is the wikipedia page:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_platform

Anyways, as you can see there is a platform that is controlled by 6 linkages which are connected to motors (they are the darker bars). I did some very rough calculations, and if the arm from the motor to the linkage is 100mm, the linkage is 450mm, and the estimated total weight of the platform is 140kg, then in order to lift the platform from the lowest position to the highest position in 0.5s (the motors rotate 180 degrees, providing a lift of 200mm), I would need a torque of 35 N*m at 120 rpm. This significantly increases the price of the project, so I thought of a different solution.

My idea is to use three (more or less depending on price) linkages that consist of two bars, joined with a locating dowel, spring, and linear bearing. I would configure the springs so when the platform is at half height (motor arms horizontal), the force of the springs is equal to the weight of the platform. Note: all linkages are connected with heim joints (rose joints).  My idea is that by doing this, I can reduce the torque needed by the motors, reducing the cost of the project.

I have some concerns about this idea. I am not entirely sure if this idea will work, and I want some second opinions. If you have any reservations, recommendations, or advice I'd love to know. Thank you for your time.

Edit: Just realized I can do a pretty simple simulation of this in SolidWorks. I'll get to work on that. In the meantime, if you want to guess the outcome, or have any advice, go ahead and post.

Edit: In case anyone happens among this thread, it appears my idea was right. [Here]() is a video of the motion simulation I made, which is not incredibly realistic but accurate enough for a proof of concept. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/sOX7LKM.jpg) are the plotted results I got for the torque, displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the motors. Now I can make a more realistic model, do some more math on the spring constants, arm lengths, dimensions, and everything else to get a more realistic model. It should be all plug and chug from here.

I'm essentially looking to do a little comparative study of energy efficiency across multiple manufacturing processes to understand the best way to make certain parts. I want to do this theoretically - not imperially - so I can look at what processes could be improved by comparing the ideal versus measured energy inputs.

Here's an example to add some color to my question:

Assume I have an aluminum part that I need to make, with the only specs being that it must be in a certain shape - ignore material / tolerances requirements, tooling costs, equipment amortization, etc. - I want just the energy to work the material.

I could:

* Mill it from billet
* Die cast it
* Closed-die forge it
* etc...

I know this is highly dependent on part geometry - i.e. if I only need to machine a little off a billet, maybe it's better than die casting, but if I need to carve a lot of complex features over hours on a mill - maybe die casting wins.
I'd ideally like to think of it as:

* Machining 6061 aluminum requires ## kJ per kg of material removed (probably mostly spindle power)
* Die casting 6061 aluminum requires ## kJ per kg of material cast (probably mostly energy to melt the metal)

I had an idea recently and I'm curious if it could be feasible for an energy storage application.

I've read about a company several months ago that was developing energy storage with train cars filled with rock/gravel and an incline track. When energy is being generated, the train engines are powered and travel up the incline to a plateau. The train can then sit in a holding area or simply loop around until energy is then needed, which would then send the train down the incline using the engines as generators.

I haven't found any further information on if this or if it was successful, but I wondered about essentially doing the same thing but with a much higher incline and using the motor/generator weight itself as the ballast weight for the kinetic potential. I imagine a tower, cliff face, or any high incline slope with a large disk or similar construct containing the motors/generators set at roughly 30-45 degree offsets to each other so the shafts are focused to a central point of contact with the tower/incline. As I understand it, to generate any reasonable amount of energy, the generators need to be spinning at high rpm which would require some gearing/translation to get high enough during controlled fall; however, in order to use the incoming power from solar or wind (ideally), it would need to be able to turn with high torque at relatively low energy levels (basically creeping up the tower as energy is fed to it).

Does this sound feasible in any way?

93,Dealing with incompetent managers?,1400894095,"I currently work for a Japanese company that manufactures heavy equipment. About a year ago myself and a few other engineers with experience working in other companies were asked to assist in improving our engineering systems. The goal was to improve the systems and make them ""global"" since our current system is roughly 15 years behind the times (it's really bad).

After several months of brainstorming, testing, and comparing to our experience with previous systems, we came up with a list of about 100 items for improvement. The list was so detailed that the leaders of the improvement team from Japan flew over to the U.S. to discuss each one in detail. Unfortunately, most of them were ruled out as being ""too difficult to implement at this time"", so we went with plan B. 

Plan B involved showing a detailed assessment of the time wasted in the current systems based on 4 engineers recording the time they lost every time they had to wait for a particular system. We then compared this to the time it would take to do a similar task in Siemens TeamCenter with the help of former colleagues at other companies. What we found is that our total wasted time per user per day is about 65 minutes compared to TeamCenter. When you consider that we have 800 users who spend 60% of their time in the system, we have a possibility of saving over $10 million a year in wasted engineering time. We presented these numbers to the same leaders from Japan and gave the recommendation that we replace the current system with TeamCenter. Once again we were told it is not possible because it will take too long to implement and the cost is not justified.

After many discussions and arguments, we came to the realization that the manager over the improvement team is completely incompetent. He doesn't understand the current system, he's completely oblivious to how drastically things can be improved, and he is a firm believer that time is not equal to money (a Japanese cultural thing) so the upgrades can not be justified. He also doesn't believe that 90% of our industry is using Siemens TeamCenter even after an onsite presentation from Siemens!

At this point in time I'm about to pull my hair out and I don't know what to do.

96,Would like an opinion on pvc pipe glue strength!,1400884753,"Hi.

I'm designing an object that will have one part of it be almost completely held together by pvc pipe glue. It's a standard corner joint with a 90 degree elbow as a connector.  I've calculated that the maximum torque force that will be exerted on the part(and therefore the glue) will be 31.0 Nm.  Is it reasonable to expect the glue to hold this amount of force? I don't know if you need any other information.  The torque force is perfectly perpendicular to the glued joined.  The force is external.

I don't expect you guys to be the glue experts, but I'm having trouble picturing the strength of this force, but i suspect someone else might have a more palpable idea of what exactly I'm asking of this glue to do, so any general estimations and guesses will be much appreciated.

97,Questions regarding opening a small engineering consulting firm. Have any of you tried and succeeded/failed? Any input is welcome.,1400883080,"So I posted here not too long ago about how I wasn't a fan of working for large corporations (as far as my experience goes, which is admittedly lacking). I'm trying to kind of ""find my way"" in a sense within the broad spectrum of career possibilities that engineering offers, and my next idea is to open up my own small engineering firm after 4-6 years of post grad employment. 

What I know:
- Hours will be long
- Little to no profit within the first few years at least

What I don't know:
- P. Eng. necessary?
- How much money to have saved up before attempting this endeavour
- How to go about establishing a client base before going out on my own. I'm good at making contacts and have so far had no problem at finding my own internships and jobs, but how would one go about meeting people that could be potential clients?
- Which business courses to take before attempting this
- As shown by the lack of points in the ""what I know"" section, what to expect in general.

Finally, I'm wondering if I am planning on starting a firm for the right reasons. I never minded sinking in 60+ hours of work during school, presumably since I was working towards my own accomplishments. I'm guessing that starting my own small firm would be a similar mindset. Putting in large amounts of hours for a corporation or large business, however, doesn't leave me feeling very fulfilled as it seems as if I'm slaving away to help some higher-up make a buck rather than working towards my own prospects.

I work at a radio station, and as we've been clearing out the old stuff (new director, other updates) I came across a plate with lights on it originally used to tell what direction an antenna was pointing. I already have devised and been given the go ahead to make a wind vane to display the wind direction. Basically a [Slip Ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_ring) with breaks on the outer ring that the brushes would send a signal to the different lights.


Knowing the wind direction is great and all, but does very little good if one does not know the speed. That's where this post comes in. I remember in the past when working with small DC motors that they can also be used as generators (dynamo or tachogenerator if you will). I want to use this property to help me determine the wind speed and display it to some LED displays I pulled from and old control board. 

The general setup would  be that the anemometer turns a large gear, which then turns a small gear on the motor's shaft, inducing a current. The voltage is then read by an Arduino or similar. Which then controls the LED displays to show the wind speed.

Something like this: http://i.imgur.com/ZpURHqV.png

I have the tools and materials to build all of this except the motor and gears. Which is what brings me to the question part of this post.

* What motor would you recommend that I use?
* What gear ratio do you recommend?
* Any suggestions to simplify this project or maybe look at it another way?

1,Dual Major: Mechanical &amp; Civil,1400866871,"Hello, all!

I am a current junior mechanical engineering student at a fairly large public university (22k students), and I am considering picking up a second major in civil engineering. At my university, the first four semesters of each program is mostly the same. I am five semesters in, and currently on my third co-op with a Fortune 500 company. If I stick with MECE, I will most likely go into design and attempt to get into my company's prestigious development program, which would allow me to get my MS in MECE.

However, I'm not quite sure anymore that this is the route that I want to take, even if it is very promising. I am very interested in tidal power and off-shore wind. I have a minor in renewable energy at my school, and in taking some of these interdisciplinary classes, I don't feel that I want to stick to my flow chart and just learn what my other classmates do. I am very interested in becoming an engineer in many aspects of these industries (project planner, structural engineer, sound and vibes engineer), and really, I'm just trying not to close any doors for my future.

I know that I will learn more on the job than I will ever learn in a classroom, but I just want to be prepared.

The reasons that I feel like I should pick up this second major are as follows:

1) If I were just just take civil classes as technical electives, I would have completed over 60% of the major, and I feel that I might as well finish, since I am young and not tied down in any way. I really do just want to be a sponge for knowledge. I want to be a pro. I look at my MECE coursework, and have realized that I want to be able to do more than that.

2) Looking at current engineers in the tidal industry, they have degrees in maritime systems eng, ocean eng, or civil eng. I know that there is most definitely a place for MECE's in this industry, but since it is so small, and my university isn't too prestigious, I need to make myself as appealing as possible. I am also strongly considering going to URI or Texas A&amp;M for a master's in Ocean Engineering. Looking at the OE coursework, it looks like everything I want to do and learn. I wish my university offered an OE bachelor's program, but they do not. I figure that if I switch to OE at a different school, it may take just about as long for me to get two bachelor's in engineering at my current school.

So, in conclusion, I know that I want to work in a specific industry because that's where my passions and research efforts are, but I'm trying to find the best way to pragmatically mend my flow chart to make myself more appealing, and, above all else, diversify my toolset. At the same time, I don't want to shut myself out of any opportunities that may come my way. I am working on my third co-op with a top 10 (F500) company and also have done research in solid waste stream management, so my resume is fairly impressive at this point.

26,Is your CV / resume written in short sentences or bullets? How long is it compared to your countries average engineering CV?,1400768703,"Hi,

I'm basically trying to change industry (away from nuclear). I have the basic, essential skills, but I don't think my skills come across on my CV, unless you know the jobs.  

My CV is laid out as simple short sentences, which rely on the reader knowing the process. I am thinking about changing this so I am more direct with my roles. This would involve listing bullet points of the roles. However, it would take my CV over the UK standard of two pages.

What's your opinion on CV's, should they be short sentences or should I specify the tasks  in more detail using bullets? What about length. How long is yours compared to your local standard.

Do you know if anywhere where I can get a copy of different types of CV's?  I'm a chemical engineer and I've had around 5 jobs.

I have a concern that if the drive roll is too large that there may be a point where the rewind spindle will touch the drive material. As they are line speed controlled and the drive spindle will rotate at a lower rpm thus loosing thickness at a lower rate than the rewind spindle increases its thickens while rotating at a high rpm to match line speed. Can anyone help me with this concept and possibly show me in equations? Roll - Roll systems are a new area to me and I am just trying to get my head wrapped around this project. Thanks.

Every engineer I've seen has been drawing pictures in AutoCAD, and even then, they were coming up with some crazy shit every now and then. 

So, do you feel, as a mechanical engineer, you can take the knowledge that you have learned from school about physics and kinetics and statics and stuff, and go build whatever you think looks cool and exciting and interesting to you, with no limits to time or money? Or does this kind of knowledge only come from a certain career path, a certain specialization of ME?

For the more complicated projects, would a combination of ME and EE knowledge be necessary to create these things on my own?

29,Question about Job interviews,1400735947,"I just wanted to receive some input from you guys.

The story is as follows. I graduated as a Mechanical Engineer in Egypt. I am currently working at a call center for Vodafone U.K. and after being there for only 2.5 months, I am rising pretty quickly and am already made Managers' Delegate. But of course, I want to continue work in my field of study.

Two days ago a friend told me there are interviews at [Elsewedy Electric](http://www.elsewedyelectric.com/FE/Common/Default.aspx).
The position applied for was Production Engineer. After the interview I was told that I was accepted and that I will be called back in for a 2nd interview.

Yesterday i was contacted by HR recruitment for [Leoni](http://www.leoni.com.eg/). I went to the interview and was applying for either Process Engineer, or Maintenance Engineer. After the Interview i was told that i was most likely not rejected and to wait 2 weeks for conformation for a technical interview. 

Now both of the engineering positions would probably be less salary than what I make currently which bothers me since I am trying to save up to buy a car and apartment, and less benefits of course which means sacrificing quite a bit. At Vodafone U.K. i get free access to gold's gym and free transportation to and from work and also will not be paying anything on my phone bill as long as I am with them. With the  other companies I would have to use public transportation which would be coming out of the salary, and would probably start gaining weight. But I would be on the right track to forward my career.

is there anyway I can recover from this situation? Should I call the recruiter and be like no that salary range will not work for me.

Am I in the wrong field?

The only problem is that they dont mix well and need to be shook up before starting the engine.  biodiesel is made by methylating the hydroxylgroup  on the carboxylic acid of a fatty acid which makes it more hydrophobic and not mix well.

So, in order to make these mix better should I..
+not methylate the fatty acid, just use used filtered vegetable oil 
+make the ethanol less hydrophobic (convert to aldehyde? ether? modify alcohol group?)
+use an additive (suggestions?)


I would like a way that is over all cheaper that gas+oil mix.  I can get the used cooking oil my self and i will be distilling the ethanol my self from fermentation so there will be other alcohols present.  i'm a pepper survival hobbyist and would like to do this in the most independent  self sustaining way possible.

""The white-collar job was supposed to save the middle class, because it was machineproof. A machine could replace a guy hauling widgets up a flight of stairs, but a machine could never replace someone answering the phone or running a fax machine.


Of course, machines have replaced those workers. Worse, much worse, is that competitive pressures (and greed) have encouraged most organizations to turn their workers into machines. 


If we can measure it, we can do it faster.


If we can put it in a manual, we can outsource it.


If we can outsource it, we can get it cheaper.

[Generator](http://www.harborfreight.com/4000-peak3200-running-watts-65-hp-212cc-generator-epa-iii-69729.html) puts out 3200/4000 peak watts, with 2 15 amp circuts (30 for 240v)

the sub is 500/700w peak, 8amps, the speakers are 600w total, then I have some lights and a laptop, and a few other things. 

Might total up to 1000 more watts, but i'm not sure. 

So i'm approaching the limit of the generators capabilities and I don't want to whole system to go out on me mid-dance.

I'm quite a big motorhead myself and I'm familar, at least on a slightly-above-layperson and on an anecdotal level, with most concepts relating to cars and more recently, motorcycles.

I have heard of, and sampled the difference between normal RON95 petrol, and Shell's V-Power Racing (unknown octane number) and my butt dyno tells me that Shell V-Power seems to be marginally more responsive; and repeated real-world, though uncontrolled tests indicate that it yields a slightly better consumption.

I understand that Octane numbers only equates to knock resistance, and has nothing to do with the power (energy density, or burn rate) of the fuel and thought it is likely that whatever additives in the fuel affects the characteristics of the car. 

I concluded the above (observed through butt dyno, I'm not able to get concrete data without spending an obscene amount of money on it) when I was sampling multiple fuel brands, and I thought I enjoyed the driving experience that BHP ([which claims to have twice the additives of its competitors, last paragraph in the article](http://www.bhpetrol.com.my/infiniti.html)) gave me on my fixed-timing Honda engine.

I recently got a 200cc motorcycle (if you love cars but have yet to try riding a bike, give it a shot. You'll probably love it as much as I do!), a KTM Duke 200 which has a 11.3:1 compression ratio. While not much data is available for the engine, I am inclined to believe it is of fixed timing owing to its price point, and using RON95 fuels (no knocking, [perhaps timing has been retarded, see specs: ignition](http://www.ktm.com/my/naked-bike/200-duke/highlights.html#.U3t1Ua2SwdU), to compensate for the fuel available in the markets) from various brands doesn't seem to make a difference; until again, I tried V-Power a couple of days ago and replicated the superb response I got in the car.

My main question is: What are the additives used in fuels which engineers use to alter how it affects engines' output/response?

Sub-question: How are we able to run Ron95 fuel in a 11.3:1 CR engine reliably? The guideline I remember reading is that 95 should go in an engine no higher than 9.5:1. My second thoughts on timing is that the engineers would unlikely retard the timing if it was unlikely that their target market would be filling premium fuels. Wouldn't it be cheaper to design a lower compression ratio engine instead?

Sub-question 2: BHP mentioned that 800ppm is the maximum concentration of fuel additives, on what basis has this figure been derived from, with the understanding that the write-ups are all marketing communications fluff.

 I am working on a project that will be sending payloads into the ionosphere. My part in this was to find a way to sample microbes while the payload is up there. My design is simply a Ozonesonde like this:

http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/Antarctica/OzonesondePrepA9.28.04.JPG


Rather than having two of those long cylindrical cathode and anode containers next to each other, we will make one that has the same thing but going around the whole device. Each container connected with a tubing to pump liquid into the next one (powered by the solenoid). 

Now using the data we had, I calculated the ideal volumetric flow rate at each differentiating pressure @ ascend and descend of the flight. From there I also calculated the flow coefficient to get the efficiency of the flow.  MY QUESTION IS: Would I have to bring in fluid resistance/viscosity into consideration and calculate it? Or since the solenoid is not that great of strength let me neglect fluid resistance?

If I am unclear let me know, in a blur right now from working on the project all day lol. Thanks guys!!!!!!!!

I found some studies suggesting that high CO2 concentrations (&gt;90%) will kill bed bugs in a couple of days at the longest as well as how-to guides on fumigating for other insects with dry ice in contractor bags, so I figured I could try using dry ice to make sure there are no bugs in the stuff that I stored.  I was thinking I would measure the proper amount of dry ice (2-3 lbs per 30 gallon bag), wrap it in a towel, and put it inside the bags with the cap on the vacuum port open.  Am I correct in assuming that the CO2 would displace the air and force it, along with any excess CO2, through the vacuum port leaving an environment that is almost entirely CO2?

I think I could also leave a small opening in the bag and wait for the dry ice to completely sublimate before closing it, and vacuum a little of the gas out for the same effect, but I feel like that is more labor intensive and prone to error.
