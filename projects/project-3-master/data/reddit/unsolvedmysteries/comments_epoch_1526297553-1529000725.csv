1,Industrial engineering help for a Software guy,1528995865,"Note: I originaly asked this in r/industrialengineering but reddit wouldn't let me share the link here.

So first, a little background. I'm a 27 year old Software fan who recently decided to go to school to get a Software Engineering degree. At the same time, I have recently been internally promoted to a management position in my company's industrial engineering department. 

Over the last few months I've noticed a couple of things. First, my managers and coworkers are significantly smarter, faster thinking, more capable, and all around more knowledgeable than I am. Second, I am intimidated by those I work for/with, which has never been an issue before. I think this is likely due to being unprepared and uneducated as to what is expected of an industrial engineer.

So here are my questions. First, does anybody have any advice for books or articles to read to help me learn more about industrial engineering? Not a quick fix necessarily, but something that will help me stand on my own as I continue to work for (and hopefully get additional promotions with) my current employer. I'm also looking for anything that will help me improve my mental capabilities (logical thinking, math in my head, knowledge retention, motivation, etc.). Any advice at all is appreciated.

Second, any advice for being more assertive without appearing standoffish or making a fool out of myself? I'm hoping for advice that will help me be less intimidated without seeming arrogant or too outspoken.

3,Is getting a Master's degree in UK worth it?,1528977507,"Hi, I am a recent Thermal Engineering bachelor who acquired his degree in Eastern Europe and I am looking for a scenery change. 

Some background. Currently, I am struggling to find an appropriate job which requires thermal engineering in my country. My degree isn't as versatile as for example, a mechanical engineering degree, so, changing a career path to manufacturing, automotive or any different branch of engineering is a kind of reach for me. I tried applying to some jobs in UK, that would require my degree and some experience (I worked as biofuel power plant operator for a year), but they won't even acknowledge my degree, because it's a university they never heard of.

My question would be, is getting a Master's degree in, for example, Engineering management, would  make me more versatile and give me more opportuinties to find a job in the Engineering sector in UK?

I’m trying to find out about this ‘thing’ that was standing at the back of a 19th Century flour mill and it’s powerhouse. 

 It was variously described as a ‘boiler’ or as grain storage and I can’t work out which is correct. I’ve spoken to former employees from as far back as the 60s, and all I can find is that it wasn’t used in their time. 

It’s on a seemingly solid piece of concrete, so I can’t see how it could have been a boiler but could it have been connected to a steam or diesel engine for another reason, or been adapted in some way? Does the concrete base help date it? 

I was hoping that there might be something obvious that means it couldn’t be an X or only Y’s had that etc.

24,Anodizing and Powder Coating,1528937001,"I have kind of a weird question--is it possible to both anodize and powder coat a piece of aluminum? I'm relatively familiar with powder coating processes, but have pretty much zero experience with anodizing. 

Here's the background:

I have an aluminum part that I want to powder coat and then laser etch in a pattern back down to bare aluminum. I was thinking it would be kind of cool for the bare aluminum bit to be anodized and dyed so that it has a tint of color. The coloring is the primary reason for the anodization, but this is the neck plate on a guitar which is subject to considerable wear via belt buckles, so a bit of surface hardening on the non-coated bits would be nice as well. Is this a reasonable thing to do? 

I already have the part fabricated and powder coated, but I suspect the acids involved with anodizing would attack the coating. However if that's a problem then it *is* feasible to fabricate a new part and anodize before coating. Is *that* something I could do? My concerns are that something about the coating process would mess with the anodization (heat, chemical interactions, ???), or that the anodization would somehow cause the powder coat to not take. If grounding the part after anodization is an issue, I could cut a bit into the part on a non-visible surface to get through the oxide layer. 

Lastly, am I even asking the right questions here? Is there an easier way to do what I'm trying to accomplish? For what it's worth this is for a one-off guitar, so production feasibility is not a concern. Also, the aluminum is 6061-T6 if that's a concern.

That being said, I am very aware of how dangerous this process can be. We are talking about pressurizing highly flammable and explosive vapors and liquids, surrounded by fire... Ya, not something I want to cut corners on. So where do I start? Do I talk with an engineer to write up a schematic?  
Also, I want to make this unit modular for future updates and expansions should the need arise, but I don't know how or what I can do differently to prepare for such future updates and modifications.
For context, [here is a great video (27 minutes long) that explains one system that looks to be the safest one I have found on youtube.](https://youtu.be/kr86K5Q63Bw) You can skip through it and get the general idea of what he has going on in there.  
  
My goal in the beginning is to get the unit to produce enough fuel to sell. That way I can use the profits from the fuel to put into further expansion for the unit. from what I have gathered, there have been a few studies that suggest we can get a value of 1 liter of fuel, for every kilogram of plastic waste. I'd be happy with half of that. (this is another area I'm not familiar with, which is efficiency of the unit.)

So I am a bit all over the place with this post I realize. I guess I just need to be pointed in the right direction of where to get started, what safety measures I need to take, where I can get a schematic of the unit made up, production efficiency, and where I can find all of the needed parts to build such a unit.

38,Is it possible or practical to replace springs and/or bearings with magnets?,1528904486,"I am a machine operator in a manufacturing facility.

One of the machines for which I am responsible functions via bearings on the bottom of its pedestals rolling over a cam which pushes the pedestals down to accept components. Once the pedestal leaves the cam, a spring inside the pedestal assembly pushes it back to proper position.

These components fail regularly and are replaced approximately every six weeks. After the springs and bearings are replaced, machine performance steadily declines day after day until another rebuild is authorized.

To the best of my knowledge, the failing components are the result of oxidization.

The technicians here have tried several solutions. I do not know specifically what they tried, but I know they were not successful.

I just got my ME bachelor's degree in May and I've been looking for my first full time job in the aerospace/defense industry.  I've applied to a number of big name companies like Lockheed Martin, UTC Aerospace, Pratt and Whitney, Boeing, and Blue Origin to name a few.  

The other day I got a call from a staffing agency that I talked to at my school's career fair telling me there was an opening at Sikorsky Aircraft (owned by Lockheed Martin) that I would be a good fit for and today they offered me the job.  It pays $27/hour with 1.5x overtime and it is a permanent contract.  The staffing agency offers benefits such as a 401k plan and healthcare, but I'll be on my dad's healthcare plan until I turn 24 or 25 (not sure the exact age) so I'm not too concerned about that.  I am wondering if this is a good offer?  On one hand, it gets my foot in the door at Lockheed Martin which is a company I'd love to have a career at, and I also don't have any interviews comping up with other companies.  On the other hand, the pay isn't what I expected to make out of college and I know it is better to actually work for a company rather than be a contractor there.

To give you some more information, I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree and minors in computer science and mathematics from UConn, magna cum laude with a 3.91 GPA.

69,Does it make sense to get a bachelors in Computer Science and a Masters in Biomedical Engineering?,1528835737,"I’m a rising sophomore majoring in CS and I’ve always liked biology and mathematics. I didn’t know that there was a field that combined the two, so I chose to major in CS because it’s an in demand major that I enjoy. However, I recently discovered that biomedical engineering exists and have decided that it’s what I want to do more than anything. Unfortunately, it seems that a bachelors in BME has very few job prospects. Also, switching from CS to any of the engineering majors would delay my graduation by a year. After looking at several BME graduate programs, I’ve found that with a CS degree I could still get accepted into many BME graduate programs provided that I have a good resume and basic knowledge of biology, chemistry, and engineering. This seems like a really good option to me because I could graduate with a very marketable CS bachelors, while still being able to get a MS in BME, which is basically required to get a job in that field anyways other than having a bachelors in EE or ME and finding a company willing to teach you the biology/chemistry side. 

My main worry is that having a BS in CS would lock me in to bioinformatics. Perhaps companies would see my BS was in CS and have me programming and handling big data, when what I really want to do is the research and design side. Things like designing prosthetics, artificial organs, and possibly nanotechnology that would go in the body when that becomes a bigger field. Is this fear founded? Would companies would see that I have a BS in CS and assume that I want to do more of the programming aspect? I wouldn’t mind this at all, though I would prefer to design the actual technology itself, and use my programming background as a useful tool, rather than the other way around.

Just looking for some general advice / career advice. 

Background: I did a Mechanical Engineering Technologist Diploma 5 years ago.. Since then, I have been working in the Oil and Gas field and mostly doing design/modelling and testing for field equipment. However, I am extremely bored and not really motivated in this job. I think it is just due to a lack of interest and motivation. 

My plan is to go back to school for a engineering degree in 2019. I have discussed with the local university about my options and it sounds like it will be a 3 year program to obtain my undergrad Degree in Mechanical engineering. It would be a few transition courses and then I could enter into year 2. 

So.. where I live, most of the mech jobs are in the oil and gas sector. I just do not think my passion lies there. I am a big car enthusiast, I have a passion for alternative energy and also I really like the medical field (biomedical engineering). 

So this is where I am confused.. When I did my Diploma, I had a clear understanding of what I wanted to do and where I wanted to work. Now, I do not have that clarity. So I am looking for advice as to which field I should pursue or how should I find my motivation?

Is it better to just jump into school and determine which field to go in to (all 3 are mechanical options or fields)? Should I just look for a new job? To be honest, I am just nervous about going back to school. I am worried that I will go back and still be bored after completing a degree.

79,pneumatic cylinders and vacuum vs pump,1528822437,"Hey All,

Not sure if this is the right place to ask but....

I recently bought a vacuum pump to work with silicon degassing. I apparently bought a much stronger pump than I will actually need. As a result, I was thinking about some other uses I could rationalize the expense for, and noticed a couple things that could be better utilized if they moved, a little bit. 

To the question. I understand that pneumatic cylinders are typically used with compressed air for a number of reasons. The primary one being that you can ""store pressure"" but you can't ""store vacuum"", so the maximum work load is limited to what the pump can pull at any given moment, rather than what it can store in a pressure vessel. Putting that aside, is there any reason I couldn't use the vacuum pump to power some low load pneumatic cylinders? Specifically worried about cylinder seals, and damage to the pump. (the pump is rated for continuous use, and at 1/3 horsepower is able to produce far more pressure that I would need for the application I have in mind)",AskEngineers,False,Red9inch,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8qkjwt/pneumatic_cylinders_and_vacuum_vs_pump/
80,Electrical Engineer to Software (?) Career Advice,1528820497,"I'm a senior electrical engineer at a major engineering corporation. I like what I do. I'm fairly well compensated and have the freedom to pursue my own projects on my own schedule, for the most part. The last several major projects that I have done were very successful and I was looking forward to some more research-oriented technology development goals in the near future. However...


Recently, my manager called me to his desk. I figured it was bad news from his demeanor. The short version is that our software engineering group across the country is being dissolved and he's looking to me to pick up the work statement since I am the only programmer in our engineering department. In fact, I'm the only electrical engineer and am considered ""the controls guy"" since I can read a schematic. 


We have no budget to hire anyone for at least another year or two. My manager understands that this is a huge undertaking and that I am probably the only person that reports to him with the background, education, and stubbornness to figure out how to make a functional end product. He wants me to come up with a plan that transforms me into a senior C# developer in as short of time as possible. Since I have no real mentorship for this, I decided to turn to my favorite subreddit for suggestions. 


Oh, the product is mission critical testing software for electronics control systems that currently has about 80-100 manhours put into it per week by the 4-man team that's going away. It requires constant support because our product (avionics) is always changing. My manager says I can pull from within the department for help even though most of my coworkers are mechanical engineers and more used to drafting benches than computer-based CAD. ""How hard would it be for you to teach someone how to program a computer from scratch?"" was one question he asked me. 


Right now my plan is to tell him I need at least 2-4 hours per day every day to just sit at my desk and self-teach the language (since I know C and Python, not C#). I'm thinking I need at least a 2 week trip to hang out with the team that's dissolving to learn their work statement. The guys are all being reassigned to a much more exciting project so they're not mad and mostly just pity me, heh. 

Are there any other things I should be considering? My current/future grad school courses kind of cover software development so I'm not freaking out totally...yet. I've just never done it professionally..and definitely never as the lead/single-point-of-failure. Like, I'll be scheduling code reviews...with myself. Most of my department is single digit years away from retirement so most are hesitant to learn new things. Only one person has volunteered to help to date. 


I'm not really happy that my career is getting shunted into software development but I understand that it's a decision far above me. I could start looking for a new job but getting paid to learn software might be a good springboard into something else. Am I being too whiny? Is this a good opportunity? How do I even plan the transition without being knowledgeable in the language?

85,Industrial Engineer: Worked at my company for 4.5yrs. Need some advice on how to handle next step.,1528815689,"Background: Industrial Engineer, working for a footwear manufacturing company on their distribution side.

I started to work for my company on my last internship before graduating with my Bachelors. The University I went to had a three internship program, two of which I did for a heavy equipment manufacturing company.  At the end of my co\-op I had to take two classes to graduate so my manager at the time offered me the position, I accepted because I thought it was a good opportunity and because they would spend $5k a year towards my Masters. June of 2016 I graduated with my Master of Engineering in Industrial Engineering, did not have to sign a contract for the tuition reimbursement. 

After June 2016 our company reorganized and create an Industrial Engineering Department so that the distribution centers could share resources, previously I stayed at my DC and never helped on any external projects. With IEs being combined I started to travel for projects, we built a DC in California and are also upgrading out Warehouse Management Software (WMS) in all our DCs globally. With the new WMS software we also purchased a Labor Management package from the same vendor and are using it to upgrade out incentive programs in the DCs. I was put in charge of the program by the Director of our team... here is where my questions/problem are.

I asked for a promotion in title after my master degree because I had been with the company for a couple years and the knowledge I had on our system was second only to the Director of our department. I was told I would need to take on more work, how I ended up with the LM software. With managing the software for multiple buildings I have to ask the other IEs do do things such as time studying the new processes, creating XYZ maps for the building so that we can track travel, etc.

At the beginning they seemed fine with it, even supportive since they knew I had a better handle of the software and logic of how to design standards. 

Our team is built of 5 people: 

Director: IE for 20\+ years, 

Me: IE for 4ish years, 

Timmy: still in college

Tommy: Not an IE by education was in IT, joined our company around the time I did but only got the IE title this year

Bobby: Time study technician  

I check on them about once or twice a week and they are falling behind or are not doing some the tasks I ask them to do. I update the Director of Engineering just to cover my own ass.Part of me asks would I listen to anyone who told me what to do but was the same level as me, why would these guys listen to me and part of me says hey you're on the same level as them if you ask them to do their job and they don't do it, it's not your responsibility. They have visibly been frustrated with me asking them to do things and I am getting to my wits end on having to be responsible for other people without being compensated for it. We as a team get along after work, go grab drinks whenever we are in one anthers cities, it's just the work part where we get frustrated. I have talked to the Director about getting a promotion and he agrees that I should but says he is working with HR on it, it's been 6\+ months at this point.

What should I do with the promotion? What should I do about this project.How do I get these guys to want to kill it and strive to beat deadlines not push them back...

88,Next Step for an Autonomous UAV?,1528809763,"Hey!
(I posted this in Aerospace Engineering Subreddit,but seems to be kind of dead there)

So I am currently in the process of building an autonomous fixed wing UAV (Not a quadcopter). I am currently a Senior studying Mechanical Engineering .

I have finished building the RC Plane from a kit and it flies reasonably well (More so my flying skills are weak).

I have also finished my wiring to go through an arduino for the most part, meaning:

All control surfaces are controlled by arduino through servo angle
Throttle control for DC Brushless motor controlled by arduino
Ultrasonic sensor for measuring distance from ground.

I have also put together a simple PD control for pitch and roll stabilization. Though the tuning has not been done yet (weather has been bad around my area so waiting for good weather to start testing my current system)

Right now I have radio communication going through just a normal receiver typical in RC planes, however I'm am currently researching radio control transceivers to send commands as well as receive telemetry.

My University doesn't have an Aerospace Program so I don't really have anyone in my vicinity to really get into the a lot of the nitty gritty of making this system work.

Here are some of the Big questions I have currently:

How do I put together a flight control system without reliably knowing the flight dynamics of my UAV? Is there a way to create equations that will reliably predict the state of the system if given an input ( e.g. what would the pitch angle of my plane be if I elevator deflection is ** degrees). Whats the best way to go about this, I was thinking of just trying to get as much data as I can and do some curve fitting?

What are the algorithms/software I should be looking into for path planning? I'm very weak in the algorithm area I would really love input on this end.

Which sensors should I use to do state estimation for the plane? For example measuring where the plane is in space. I am considering just going with GPS but I'm not sure if that's the best way to go about it.

What is the knowledge that I don't know I'm missing required for this project? Any helpful books/website recommendations?

I'm currently working as a PV (photo-voltaic) Designer at a solar company in southern California. Before working at my current company, I graduated with a BSME degree in 2015 and worked with a different solar company right after graduation. A year into that role, stuff happened and I was laid off (it wasn't due to my performance in any way. The company was having waves of layoffs to save cost). I ended up getting my EIT certification in hopes it'll help me find another job outside of the solar industry. But what happened instead was I was unemployed for about a year until I was contacted by another solar company for a PV Designer position. This is the company I currently work for. I want to work for a different industry other than solar. There's nothing wrong with solar, but because of the new tariffs, the company I'm currently working for is making some changes. That means layoffs (which has been happening) and finding any area they can cut cost.

Has anyone experienced a similar situation and was able to find an engineering job outside of the solar industry? I know the question is broad, but I'm just trying to get ideas in a different career path since I'm currently searching for another job.

23,Engineering Advice for a cosplay I have in mind,1528710635,"Hey guys!

I'm just getting into the world of cosplay and for my second project (my first being a WIP of Kirishima from BNHA), I'm interested in doing [Junk Dog](https://www.ezcosplay.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/image/500x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/e/megalo_box_junk_dog_j.d._boxing_suit_cosplay_costume.jpg) from Megalo Box. 

For the brass cylinders (pistons??) I already have an idea of using PVC pipe and putting a layer of copper foil and athletic tape on it. However, for the rest of the machine parts I'm somewhat lost on how to attempt it.

Luckily, my uni has a free to use invention studio, which includes a 3d printer, wood working, water jets, metal working tools, etc. and on-site staff that helps with equipment. My idea is to prototype the gear with wood and maybe translate it to some lighter metal (like aluminum) or paint over some wood/pvc to keep costs and weight low. I'm not well versed in this kind of engineering so I wouldn't be sure what to ask or look into, terminology-wise (joints? pivots??).

I'm not sure how to get started in figuring out all the calculations for an exo-skeleton like design, nor the intricacies in developing the correct structures (hydraulic-like structures for the arms, for example).

However, it's becoming very apparent to me that I'm not going to like this down the road. I was always a bit more software than hardware oriented, but enjoyed both aspects. While I haven't written any code on the job yet, I've read a fair amount of the low level code I'll be interacting with and I don't think I want to keep doing this.

I know about imposter syndrome, and experienced it the first few days, but after sleeping on it Friday and Saturday, I really feel like I can do it, I just don't want to as soon as possible.

They work more with higher level languages and data, both which I am both more adept at and enjoy far more. However the company advised me to reapply for the embedded position since my qualifications were a match for both. The reason why I was fine with the switch was also because I was fresh out of an Embedded class and really enjoyed it. And then I only got an offer for the Embedded position.

I looked for the original posting and the software engineering team still had the posting up. My current plan is to set up a meeting with the 2 engineers I met with and ask them if I would still be a good fit. But I'm not sure how to express this without coming off really bad.

2. Should I be using 4.2 A instead of 2.1 A for the previous question? Its a bipolar 2\-phase motor, and I know there is a stepping mode that fully activates both phases at once to hold the motor in between phases with double the torque.

This year i am going to leave my high school and then apply to a university. So the problem is: bionic sphere is very extensive and i don’t know what kind of education such engineer should have. 

When i think about bionic implants or limb prostheses in their best form, i mean, a devices that interact with human brain and neurosystem, i come to a conclusion that such inventions are likely to be developed by a group of people, including chemists, physicists, computer scientists, different engineers and attached to a human body by some kind of currently nonexistent surgeons. I live in Russia and, in fact, there are two ways to go (two chairs as we say). 

The first one is to go to MIPT (Russia’s top technical university, which has really nice reputation and possesses good modern labs) to study a programme including fundamental physics, chemistry and math (aka biomedical physics). 

The other chair is to go to a university called Higher School of Economics - Another Russia’s top University ( named in that way due to it’s history, nevermind… ) which offers a programme including computer science, programming, neuro system development and biology data analysis (aka computer science). The thing is, this very programme is taught in English and designed in ‘collaoration’ with London School of Economics and Political Science which also means that a student gets 2 diplomas at the end. Sounds cool, but too many ‘economy’ and ‘politics’ words, isn’t it ?

Frankly speaking there is another alternative which i didn’t mention: «faculty of fundamental physical and chemical engineering» in MSU (aka Russia’s №1 university). That is because msu is said to be super old-fachioned university with super fundamental theoretical way of teaching with books from 70’s and 80’s. Anyway msu keeps it’s status.

This is for a prototype still so we are using an off-the-shelf plastic light fixture globe. A beam has to come out of it (example: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ku7FFjAKywA/maxresdefault.jpg ) 
The white globes aren't an option as they have a pigment added to the plastic and since they are thick the light beam gets diffused/blurred too much.

This is definitely not PMMA material as I filled it with acetone for whole 2 days and then paint stripper and they had zero effect on it.

I then tried sanding the outer side but the results were quite poor, no matter the grade of sandpaper it was too translucent and using even courser sandpaper just produced scratched rather than uniform diffuse surface.

I am currently an undergrad at a state university for mechanical engineering. I am 22, and I know this seems young but I still have about 2-3 more years to go, which means I will be finishing up my degree when I’m 25 (more or less). I am not sure how it is elsewhere, but I have met many people who are younger than me (18-20) but are in the same classes if not advanced. I will be finishing up for my degree within 6 years while I know others are doing it for 4-5. However, I’ve also met some other students who are in their mid to late twenties, going back to school to pursue engineering. They will probably graduate in their late 20s to very early 30s. 

Thus my question is, will age matter that much for companies seeking fresh out-of-college engineers? 

I understand that seeking internships throughout undergrad is important, but I’d love for the answers to also take into account those who are not able to seek out internships for their own reasons (if it matters).

65,Cost Effective Way to Increase Gas Pressure From Utility Line?,1528584041,"Something came up at work that I am not directly involved in, but I am curious if there is a simple/cost effective answer.  We have a gas fryer system which, per the spec sheet, requires a NG (natural gas) pressure of 7"" of WC (water column).  A customer ordered this piece of equipment knowing that this was a requirement.  They are now telling us that the utility company can only guarantee 4"" of WC.  The concern here is that, since the fryer uses an ""atmospheric"" burning system, a lower gas pressure will result in a lower output of combustion energy; which will increase the initial time it takes for the fryer to heat up and may make holding a set temperature more difficult.  

From what I've followed, the customer knows one solution would be to purchase and install a ""gas booster"", but they are telling us that this would have a ""significant impact to costing"".  Sales has told them that we can ""supply alternative piping schemes"" to get them the pressure they need.

So, as someone who knows basically nothing about gas piping/systems, is there a relatively inexpensive way to do this?  I don't think this was fair for sales to say, since we are an OEM and definitely aren't a building/construction firm.  We definitely don't do any sort of gas piping design AT LL. That, and the customer knew the requirements when they signed off on the order.  I'm thinking that if the pressure needs to be increased, you basically need some sort of pump; or some way of introducing more energy to the system to increase the pressure.  

Again, I'm not familiar at all with these kind of things.  Anyone know of a cost effective way to do this, or is this a case of a customer having a cake and wanting to eat it too?

I want the final flow out of each end point to be equal, so I adjust the valves until the endpoints are visually similar in output. What I'd *like* to do is calculate or simulate the  system beforehand so that instead of many fittings and valves, I have a machined or 3d printed block with internal passageways that are sized to evenly distribute the fluid to each opening with balanced pressure.

I lead several projects large and small in a highly visible role and am given a lot of latitude on execution and architecture.

I have two main questions:

1. I'm not sure if or how I should be helping people with their problems.  I've read several places that ""if you help someone out that's in a bad spot and their project is successful, they get the credit, promotion, and bonus over you, as it looks like their superior leadership and influence made you help them, when really it was the fact they were totally fucked and you needed to help them to save the project.""  So far, I've been taking 3 approaches.

 a. If I can help them but don't have the bandwidth to lead their project, I say ""sorry"" and walk away.  I work on things that will get me promoted and not you.

 b. If I can fix their problem and their program is interesting, I gradually take over their project by osmosis and drive it to completion.

 c. I don't help them, but use their ongoing river of problems to justify spinning up a program wide effort to fix root cause ""so that we won't experience X project's ongoing problems next time"".  This also puts me in a position to lead projects of type X in the future.  It also prevents me from being put in charge of the failing X project as I'm too busy with my program wide fixes.

2.  Often I have been in a situation where I attend some design or architecture review of a project with problems and say ""Hey, you should try Y technology/implementation/architecture rather than what you're doing as I've seen it work better for this type of problem in the past.""  Then I walk away and 3 months later their program is humming along, having implemented the solution I suggested to a T.  Now from a wasted work perspective it's nothing to me, it took 5 minutes to come up with it, but I'm thinking I'm missing an opportunity to be more visibly a fixer\-of\-problems.  Therefore, I'm tilting towards sending emails instead of just saying things verbally ""Hey, it looks like you're having problem Z.  I've seen architecture/implementation Y work better in the past and think you should consider it"" (cc: Director of Engineering).

I very strongly do not believe in the view that ""just do good work, keep your head down, and you'll be recognized"" as I have seen a lot of quiet genius plow horses get stepped on, marginalized, get credit stolen from them, and pushed out because they didn't look out for themselves first.

Yes, I have a mentor.  No, I'm not going to discuss this with him as he's internal to the company. He's a technical mentor, not a political one.

The system the RVs use is they measure the rotation of the wheels to determine which angle to turn each wheel. Since the ride path is fixed, they know exactly when to turn each wheel just based on how many times the wheels have rotated and at what part of the rotation the wheel is in. Most of the time when the ride breaks down, its due to the RV not knowing where it is/the rotation of the wheels and position of the RV don't agree with each other.

14,Electrical switch re-rating for highly inductive and capacitive loads?,1528453268,"Hi,

When looking for switches, i've noticed that for a highly inductive/capacitive load the switches are rated for a fraction of their rated load. [source 1](https://www.nkk.com/engineering/electrical.html)  [source 2](http://www.carlingtech.com/amp-hp-volts)

Is this purely to reduce arcing (welding itself closed) during switching?


Secondly, lets say that i have a project that i know is sub 10A but the switch, which is rated at 10A is welding itself shut. I presume this can only be due to a high inrush current?

Apart from a soft start and getting a really beefy switch, is there a way to reduce the magnitude of inrush current even if it means the duration of the inrush current will be longer? Since fixing the power factor alters how inductive/capacitive the project is, will it reduce the inrush current?

Obviously, a large capacitance requires more current to charge than a small capacitance.

I do love the knowledge of engineering and technical stuff, I just feel that I'm not really excel in it.

Knowing that I will be off to Australia in 6-8 months, I spent my time traveling, planning my wedding, etc. while I was waiting for my visa.

I have been looking for a job since 6 months or more and find that it's very difficult to find a initial job in engineering, especially for the mechanical role. From what I observed civil engineering and building services are the most in demand in Australia. I did get few interviews and one 2nd interview but get rejected at the end.

There is always citizenship/PR requirement for role that closely related to my major. Mostly because Security clearance.

I am out of hope at the moment for engineering job. I feel that I brought the wrong degree. I though I should have studied civil engineering before.  I am thinking of taking diploma in building construction related /structural engineering later when I get my PR perhaps in 2 years.. but I'm not really sure if that won't be too late for me.

In 6 months it will be 2 years since I have graduated and I won't be eligible for entry level role like graduate program. So I am feeling a lot of pressure at the moment regarding my engineering career.

I am an incoming college freshman planning on studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in aerospace engineering.

Both classes are meant for people with no CS experience, so there is no difference in difficulty of the class.

My question for you Mechanical engineers is which I should take, I guess? I have asked around plenty with people I know personally and with students at the college through Reddit. Most people say the Python class is objectively better and will more effectively teach problem solving through computer science. On the other hand, fluency in Matlab is basically a requirement by sophomore year once I start taking more advanced classes. I would like to take Python, as it seems to just be the better (and more interesting class), but also I understand that Matlab proficiency might be too important to pass up or try and teach myself.

Is Matlab used more consistently during work? Or can python effectively replace it in most (if not all) situations?

I'll try to make this as brief as possible. I started my internship at a household name company about 2 weeks ago. Department placements are done by the company without your knowledge until the first day. I put down my top recommendation for department A, but got into another department (B). Other departments have given their interns 1 or 2 projects so far. My department's projects have consisted of just 2 excel sheets. They don't seem like full projects compared to the other interns'.

When I do see my mentor, I'll go to him and ask for assignments. However, as of recently, he seems very annoyed when I approach him, and he does not approach me on his own.

I did that yesterday and it was awesome. Even better than I would have expected. Even got a little jealous when I heard what their intern's projects were. Long story short, I met another guy in another team in that department, and it came up that I actually requested to be in their department. He responded saying that they asked for an intern but they didn't get one. They weren't notified that somebody requested them. I guess HR just didn't bother to acknowledge my request. A while later, I emailed the talent dev. person (HR) who is my POC at the company, asking if I could explore other departments. She ignored my IM and email.

Is it worth it to try to go to HR in person and have them switch my department or help me get work? During orientation, they said they would be there for us to come to if a situation like this arose. I can't tell if I'm just being way too demanding and pushy right now. I have had two internships before, one really good and fulfilling, and one super terrible (complete lack of work/responsibility). I really want this internship to be a positive experience for me, as I like the company as a whole and could see myself working here once i graduate. However, I am becoming increasingly worried that this internship will be another one of those I just show up for and don't produce any impact to the company or myself. I am only here until the beginning of August.

EE vs CS
u/Koaloiu
Hello everybody.

I will start University this fall and I have not decided between Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The main reason I am currently leaning towards EE is that it is (from what I've heard) a broader field and it isn't very hard to transition to a CS job while the converse is very rare. Another thing is that most of the undergraduate CS curriculum is available online. However I do think that I would like to work in a CS job ( I understand that what I mean by 'a CS job' isn't very clear. I mean a job which is typically done by people with a CS degree.) I have no programing experience so I don't know what a typical programming job looks like. So, what I want to ask is:

• What are the things that I'll learn with a CS degree that I can't with an EE degree? How much of a disadvantage will having an EE degree be when applying for a programming job?

• How much of a disadvantage will an EE degree be if I decide to apply to graduate school for CS?

• Overall, considering the future (global) job market, which degree would you recommend?

A computer engineering degree is not an option for me, unfortunately. The university I will probably go to isn't very flexible. There's a CS program and there's an EE program. No minors or double majors. I also live in a third-world country (don't know if this is relevant).",AskEngineers,False,Koaloiu,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8pemvs/bs_electrical_engineering_vs_bs_computer_science/

I have a two layered hose sleeve consisting of fiberglass and a silicone coating. The overall thickness of the sleeve is .125"". There are no specifics to the thickness of each, so we have made some deductive assumptions that the fiberglass is .075"" and the silicone coating is .05"".

I have an ambient temperature of 410° F on the outside of the sleeve. The hose, inside the sleeve, has a max rated temperature of 257° F. I need to ensure that the temperature drop, or insulation value, of this sleeve is adequate for my application at any given point.

The best formula, I have found, is Fourier's Law:

Q = (k/s)A(T1 \- T2)

Where,

Q = amount of work energy to perform the function (W, j/s) 

k = thermal conductivity of the material (W/(m\*°C) \-\-\-\&gt; \[K of silicone is 0.14 W/(m°C) and K for fiberglass insulation is 0.033 W/(m°C)\]

s \- material thickness (m) \-\-\-\&gt; \[Silicone = .00127m and Fiberglass insulation = .0019m\]

A \- given area (m\^2) \-\-\-\&gt; ""at any given point"" can be an area 1 x 1 (units neglected) to equal 1 (thus ""A"" can be omitted)

T1 = start temperature (°C) \-\-\-\&gt; 210° C

T2 \- End temperature (°C) 

Now, I know that I will have to do this for each layer of material. The problem is that I have two unknows in each formula.

For the outer silicone layer, I can't calculate ""Q"" without knowing T2 and I can't calculate T2 without knowing ""Q"".

For the inner fiberglass layer, T2 is the new T1 (for the inner layer) \- which I do not know \- I do know the needed interior temperature though \-\&gt; 121 °C but this does me no good as I still don't know Q for the inner layer.

\*\*\*Note that I converted everything to SI because it is just easier for formulation\*\*

It seems that every avenue I go down, for this scenario, has me going in circles. I tried to calculate Q by using specific energy  (heat) \- but I would need to know temperatures again.

52,"Hate My Job, and Employer Wants me to Permanently Relocate Out of U.S.",1528378806,"Hi all, 
I am originally from California, and I graduated from a with a 3.8 GPA from a UC in 2017 majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I was fortunate to have an internship and a lab position while at school, so I did have some experience to help fill out my resume. I also took quite a few project classes while at school so those are on there as well. [resume](https://imgur.com/vZpNRjH)
Even though I have some experiences working, I feel like I know absolutely nothing. And I am 100% sure it shows in the interviews I have had when applying to jobs. After graduating in late June, and moving to the bay area in July, I was unemployed/had no offer until late February. 
The job I have now I only have because my dad is good friends with someone very high up in at an electronics manufacturing company. He sent his friend his resume and I was basically forced upon this group who does PCs. Originally, I was told I would do 1 month training in Taiwan, where I would then see where I would go next. I told them I would want to live in the US, in California if possible. They were very vague about my future. 
Fast forward to now, early June. I am still doing “training” in Taiwan. If I had to pick a job description for myself, it would be somewhere between a “glorified English translator” and a “Mechanical Engineer Project Manager.”  My daily duties include helping coworkers with their English homework, writing different mechanical proposals for different projects in power point, and helping the ME team communicate with the ID team in SoCal. Once a week, for one of the projects we are working on, I help the ME team present the proposal to the American (English-Speaking) company. 
Last week, my boss called me up to basically discuss my future at this company. He “suggested” that I consider working as a foreign person in Taiwan, applying for a business VISA and what not. The problem is, I am 100% unhappy here.
The work culture here is crazy. The day starts at 8 am, and technically ends at 5:30. Many of the workers here stay until 6:15 or later. For me, it takes about 40 minutes one way to commute. So, I leave the house at 7:10 and by the time I come home it’s about 7 again. 
My boss is another American-born Chinese, so his English is fantastic. I am pretty sure that’s why he is my boss, seeing how his role is as a business PM and knows nothing about mechanical engineering. He somedays is perfectly fine with me and we have civil talks on the phone or through email. On other days, he’s cussing and yelling frustrations to me (sometimes at me) and I don’t know what to think. I cry pretty regularly, either at night, or afterwards and go to the bathroom. I never know what to expect and am always on edge.
For a long time I have been having suicidal ideations. Since moving to Taiwan and starting working here, they have only gotten more frequent. I told my dad that everyday at work, I think about “quitting,” and while he was saddened by this, he said I could not quit my job unless I first find a new one.
So, now knowing my predicament, could anyone offer me any advice?  I have also reached out to a past professor who has helped me in the past for advice but he is very busy and has not yet had time to talk to me in depth. My current plan is to apply for jobs in Taiwan (to the US), but this is very hard since by the time I wake up, people in the U.S. are getting off work. Furthermore, since I had so much trouble getting a job in the first place, with barely any more experience, how am I supposed to find another job?

I figured, to install it, we could just use bolted connections, but for the life of me, I cannot seem to find anyway to remove the welds without using heat.

Or basically any cutting mechanism that doesn’t require/produce heat.

My main question is: should I enroll in a certificate program ~4 months in length form a local rank ~150 school or the online MiT program. The way that I see it, the MiT program has name recognition and most people will accept that the skills I learned there were cutting edge, while they might be hesitant to provide the same quality to the local program.

The result is my group's specific chief retired and we are under another general manager now who doesn't have much experience with my specific discipline.  I also have an extremely high project load. I was a bit concerned with this and my performance, so I asked for a review and it came back positive.

I was doing ok juggling things, but the balls are starting to fall.  I made some mistakes on a project.  I know it wouldn't have happened if I wasn't so busy, but I rushed to get a deliverable out for review and it had errors in it.  The errors weren't significant, but they got pushed to a very high level of visibility with management at the client and my company.

I'm pretty sure that I'm going to be phased out of working for the client.  This is a huge blow to my confidence, and pretty embarrassing.  I had raised my concern with the project load before, and even recommended other people but it all seemed to be ignored so I tried to be a good team player and take on too much work.

This is your basic under\-hood windshield washer hose (literally what they sell at O'Reilly's) \- it just happens to handle up to a 26 in.Hg vacuum.

This hose is rated to withstand UP TO 257°F. It will be crossing over a lobe\-style blower with an internal temperature of 410°F. By our calculations, the surface temperature at the outer surface, where the hose will be in contact, will be around 360° \- 380°F.

d31 is the primary configuration means of storing mechanical power (electric field and force acting on piezo is perpendicular) for anyone familiar. The polarity is opposing for the two active layers. 


Now zeta is initially assumed to be small. Let’s say 0.02. My question is, would mechanical damping increase due to the electrical load being put on? Assume I’ve optimised resistance.

I just graduated with an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering last year and currently working as a geotechnical site engineer for a big rail infrastructure project.

Also, I'm very analytical but I hate rigid structures and want some creativity and variety with what I do which is why I think this career path is for me. My dilemma, however, is that my family's business is on construction and I'm an only child so pursuing the latter would do us better.

I know that this is for me to decide on, alone. However, I just want to get your thoughts/perspectives on what should I expect if I pursued these degrees. What are my career options?

2,"Hit one year mark at my first post grad job. Slightly below average wage, no raise or review given, not my exact field of interest, but decent benefits/environment. Advice on what to do and when to move on.",1528222539,"The background:

I graduated in Spring 2017 with a BS in civil engineering from an abet accredited school. I landed my first job a month later with a small civil consulting company in the ""Seattle area"" (eastside). I am a civil design engineer, EIT. I do site design (grading, frontage, storm modeling, storm drainage, sewer/water) as well as write the accompanying reports and applications for submittal. I work directly with the owner/principal engineer and 3 PEs. There's a handful of EITs and a couple interns as well but I don't work with them on projects. As a consulting company there are no other departments in the office, just a receptionist and the engineers. The company believes in learning by doing so within my first month I was the lead designer and handling submittals start to finish. 

The pros:

The company is small and has an ""open door policy"" in the office. I can walk up to PEs and even the owner any time I want to ask questions or get assignments. I have a PE on either side of my cubicle. I also get to work on all aspects of the projects opposed to somewhere larger where I may have just written reports or ran basic calculations for the first 6 months. Like I said, within my first month I was basically handling things on my own. Benefits are good, 15 days PTO, 100% paid medical/dental/vision, overtime pay, flexible (to an extent) hours. I live 10 minutes away and also have a gym nearby that's important to me. I am happy to not have a commute and also enjoy the area in general.

The cons:

I focused on structural in school. We didn't have official concentrations for our degree but I chose the structural route with my electives. Long term I want to get a masters in structural engineering and an SE along with my PE. I was unable to find any entry level structural jobs that did not require a masters and ended up taking my current job knowing it wasnt exactly what I wanted. This job is strictly civil and I will never be able to do structural engineering here. Also, the pay is about 4k-6k below the average for my area depending on the source. My rent was raised and I can no longer comfortably afford it. I was told raises were given out with 6 month reviews (in the interview as well as in writing) but neither reviews or raise has happened. In the year I've been here, 2 PEs and our only CAD drafter has quit (on good terms) without ever being replaced, meaning there is more work being distributed and less people. The work is not always interesting to me and I have weeks/months at a time that I feel burnt out. I also have no friends in the office aside from friendly acquaintances. There is a bit of an age and interest gap. 

The questions:

Now that it's been a year should I ask for a review and raise? Should I mention average salary, cost of living and that I can't even afford rent? Any advice on switching jobs to structural or going back to school? What's a good timeline for moving on? Is a year sufficient on a resume or should I hold out longer? 

Thanks for any advice. This has been stressing me out a lot lately and I just don't know what to do or when to make a move.

5,Leaving a large corporation to work at a small company?,1528217842,"Hi Reddit,

I don't post much at all, but thought I would seek out the advice from my favorite online community.

I am almost 4 years out of school with a BSME and work for a huge corporation doing a job I do not like.  I feel like the role I currently am in (Quality Engineer in an office environment) does not offer me the opportunity to gain new transferable skills, making it difficult to work towards the job I really want (manufacturing environment, either manufacturing engineer or quality engineer).

I have recently been offered a role at a very small company (&lt; 30 people) for a position I think I would really enjoy.  I would be responsible for Quality and most production operations, and I think I would love the projects and daily work.  The product line is niche, but it would offer manufacturing experience which I am looking for.

The pay would be slightly better at the new job, but I feel like I would be losing all of the connections/mentors I have gained at the huge corporation.  These are people who have climbed the corporate ladder with the same company for years, and I am not sure they would want to keep in touch if I left the company due to my disloyalty. Also, i am interested in eventually attending grad school and the new company does not explicitly offer tuition reimbursement, so graduate school opportunities may not be on the table.

If I go to a small company, will I ever be able to return to work for a large company again?

Is it worth it to find personal satisfaction doing a job you love (small company) vs working a job you hate, but may offer better future opportunities (corporation)?

What are additional things to consider when making this decision and how should I approach it?

I need advice on classes to take, and what jobs I could look for.",1528198770,"Like the title said, after three years working I was not happy as a structural engineer. The most satisfying part of the job was scripting so I figured, maybe I should take some computer classes and see how I like it. It turns out I love it. I didn't start a specific program, I've just picked classes that seemed fun, or could help me figure out what I would like to work with.

So far I've taken :

* Functional programming in scheme
* Data structures and algorithms
* Computer architecture
* Linear electronics
* Electronic components
* Biologically inspired computing
* A statistics class (already have it as an engineer, but felt like refreshing it)
* Object oriented programming in Java
* Robotics (Forward/inverse kinematics, ROS, dynamics)
* OS and network communication
* System development 

I am starting to feel the urgency of figuring what exactly I want to do professionally.
So far, I think my dream job would be to use my mech degree to build something, and add electronics to power it, and programming to control it, and AI to make it smarter. The thing is that all of these areas are pretty big on their own, and I feel like I should pick a domain to specialize, but I don't really want to! I want to build stuff and have fun, and get payed to do it!

I've tried to make a website, and that was super fun! But I don't want to specialize as a full-stack developer. I've made some simple electronics stuff, but I don't have the time to take all the classes needed to feel super comfortable working with it (embedded, signal, analogue, digital sampling etc.). Same with the other areas actually. Many interesting classes, little time.

I'm going to spend the summer working on projects that include many of the mentioned domains to figure out if I can exclude something so that I can focus on something else, but I doubt it will be easy. It's all so much fun!

Are there any jobs (beside youtuber) where I can work with many different hats? My imagination brings me to start-ups, but I wouldn't mind being part of something bigger for the social aspect as well as the possibility of being mentored. However I have the impression that in a big company I will end up specialized working in a limited area of expertise. 


Any part-time possibilities where I can use my skills? 

Any tips on which classes I should take in the future? I am currently thinking about:

* More statistics (To build on AI domain)
* Advanced Python (To be more confident in programming)
* Databases (Maybe I can learn this on my own)
* Digital Signal Processing
* Stochastic systems (kalman filter seems cool)


I might come across as I don't really know what I am doing, and you might be right. So far my guide has been my heart. I think it is time for some more structure as to how I am proceeding with my career, but I am having trouble figuring out what direction I want to go, and what direction I *can* go.

18,Effect of varying load and load distance on power while keeping effort distance and effort-end-velocity constant?,1528195479,"I am trying to create a lever which has mass on one end and i need to lift the lever. A picture showing the lever setup is in this link: https://imgur.com/WeH4oK7

The system is like seesaw ( from -20 degrees to +20 degrees at constant angular velocity for time period 't')
The input angular velocity and effort end length is same while load and load distance is varied (though load * load distance is constant). I am confused by which method should I solve the problem to find required input power.

I have come up with this much of thinking:
1. Assuming radial acceleration is effective:

    Power(P)
        = Torque * angular velocity(omega)
        = Force * force distance(r) * omega 
        = [m * (v^2 /r) ]* r * v/r
        = m * v^3 /r

2. Neglecting radial acceleration since the horizontal component is small and the motion is not continuous circular but more like seesaw:

    P = Work done / time taken
        = F * d / t
        = m * v/t * d/t
        = m * v^2 /t

Anyway, here is my question:

I am a student of history and will be doing a presentation on ancient roman aqueducts. I want to explain the syphon concept that they used to move water uphill. I have these two pictures: https://imgur.com/a/hzgX424

I understand the concept when applied to the aqueduct. I would like to be sure about the conceptual image explaining a syphon. This is what I understand: 
* P = Pressure at the small vacuum inside the pipe? 
* P0 = Pressure of the Air at the start of the Aqueduct 
* G = Gravity 
* H = Height 
* Δh = Difference in height 
* ΔP= Difference in Pressures?

Can somebody explain the formula to me? What difference of pressure is it describing? I would assume it is the difference of pressures at the start and at the end of the pipe. I tried looking the formula up but I am not sure if there is something I am missing. Any help? Thanks in advance!

54,"Motor question, trading speed for torque",1528088283,"Hobbyist, here. 

I've built a machine for dyeing fabric - think of a 36"" wide old time-y wringer washer with some extra knurled rollers to keep the fabric flat. (If you care to, you can see it in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22W5UJ4bNZM) The goal of the project was to build it completely of stuff I could get off the shelf or had just laying around. Gearbox for speed reduction and the transmission for the rollers all use plywood pulleys and belts made from recycled ... well, belts...what you use to hold your pants up, cut down to size with a strap cutter. 

Speed reduction from 1750 to ~100rpm gained enough torque along the way to lift a yard of wet fabric 24-30""; weight of fabric about 3 pounds. (The fabric is sewn in a loop, so the rollers are helped along by the weight of the wet fabric going down the back side.) The motor is a large, ancient motor, 110AC, 1750rpm - like what you'd see on a commercial sewing machine or furnace blower. 

The pulleys are fairly large, from 4"" to 8"" at the largest, because that's the limit of my skill and tools. I've got a 3D printer now, so I'll be able to work at a smaller scale and I'm wondering (here's the question, finally) if I can scale down the motor as well. I have a motor salvaged from a bread machine: IIRC it runs 110V 3500rpm.

I've decided to start a fun hobby project in which I add \[GoTo\]\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoTo\_\(telescopes\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoTo_(telescopes))\) functionality to my \[Dobsonian\]\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonian\_telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonian_telescope)\) telescope. Unfortunately, as a software developer, certain aspects of the physical mechanics are outside of my element. Specifically, I am having trouble determining the appropriate strength \(torque and holding torque\) for the motor to drive the altitude control. My plan is to affix a gear to the scope on the altitude shaft, and use a stepper motor and gear pulley to rotate the gear and telescope. \[Here\]\([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8YMk7pWZfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8YMk7pWZfU)\) is a video demonstrating this gear concept, except that his is PushTo \(moved by hand, motor just for tracking\), not GoTo \(powered and driven by the motor\).

The optical tube assembly \(OTA\) weight is 35 pounds. The weight is mostly distributed at both ends of the telescope with the mirror cell at the bottom of the tube being heavier so the center of mass is closer to that end. My current plan is to use a gear 12\-14 inches in diameter. The motor will need to be able to tilt the telescope from its starting position pointing straight up at the zenith to its lowest position pointing at the horizon. Please let me know what other parameters are required for this calculation and I will try to provide you with those.

12,What's the possibility of career trajectory going from technician to engineer,1527945916,"Hi all, this will be quite long so please bear with me. Some background info at first, question towards the end.

* Graduated about half a year ago with a B.S. in Physics from a large, well known US public university. My program allowed me to take some engineering electives and I made full use of it, focusing in mechanical. While these electives all belong to an ABET accredited program, my degree is not.
* While I always did well in the engineering electives, overall they only make up ~25% of my degree credits. I did not enjoy most of my physics courses, especially the theoretical ones, and my grades reflected this. My GPA is an unimpressive 2.89. 

* I’ve looked into getting a Masters in Engineering, but they all have 3.0 GPA requirements over the last 2 years of undergrad, which I do not have.
* Participated extensively in engineering clubs in high school and my last 2 years in college. In college I definitely spent more time on those than my courses.
* Had one internship last summer at a mechanical engineering form. My duties were the exact same as the salaried full-time engineers. Unfortunately, it’s a small company and before I joined, they made clear the inability to extend a full time offer after my internship.
* Relocation is not an option for me, which I know limits my options severely. I do live near a big city with a fairly good mechE presence. 

Clearly I have made some costly mistakes the past few years academically. Another mistake though is I only started applying for jobs after I graduated. Initially I focused on applying for entry level engineering roles at literally any nearby company with openings. I later also included technician roles. In the past half year I received 4 calls that all led to some form of an on-site interview- 3 for entry level mechE positions and 1 for engineering technician. Out of those, only the company where I did the technician interview gave me an offer.

Do note, I have nothing against being a technician. I see it as a good way to get some experience in the industry and a foot in the door. I also liked the company from my interactions with them (HR, on-site tour, panel interview with 3 different engineering managers). The pay is no where close to an engineering position, but my financial situation isn’t shabby. Looking online though, including some past posts on Reddit where people had a similar predicament, I see a lot of concerns about how taking such a role can look bad when I apply to actual engineering jobs later in the future. The one big difference I see though between my situation and theirs though, is they have an actual engineering degree which I obviously do not.
Few more pieces of information to note:

* I have gone to every large job fair hosted at my university starting 2 years before I graduated. Initially to practice speaking with recruiters and getting resume feedback, and then later to try and get jobs/internships.
* I have had my resume looked at by friends in the mechE industry who have more experience than me, as well as career services back when I was in university.
* I will paraphrase, but this technician role’s listed responsibilities include: Supporting the engineering team to develop documentation, models, and drawings. Conduct product testing, validation testing in a lab setting, assessment of process efficiencies, and reports on all three things. I don’t think it’s smart to post it verbatim here but if any of you want to take a closer look, drop me a PM.
* Studied for the FE after graduating but put it aside for now after state DoL said they count my degree for 2 years, meaning I need to work under someone with a PE for an additional 2 years before I can take the EiT.
* Several people within the engineering team at this particular company started out in a technician job. They tell me I could have the possibility of moving up internally after some time, but maybe that's what they tell everyone? I acknowledge I will need to be a rock star to possibly move up and am willing to put fourth my best effort if I think it's a legit possibility.
* If I were to accept the job, after about 1 year if I don't see it going anywhere, I plan on restarting the job search because I'm scared of my career stagnating and never getting anywhere.

Recap: I’m pretty tired of applying for jobs without much success. Grad school is off the table for now, as is the FE exam. My end goal is working as an engineer in the mechE industry. I don’t mind starting as a tech and working my way up if it will help. I feel like the position offered to me (based on job description) can be valuable experience, but maybe I’m wrong. If I keep waiting, I feel my chances of getting more offers will only go down.

Maybe you good people of Reddit have been in a similar position, or know of someone who has. So my question is what should I do? Keep applying and hoping for the best, or is taking a technician job, specifically one offered to me, a viable springboard into a future engineering job?

Aquarium glass calculators and aquarium forums indicate that in choosing glass thickness only height of the aquarium matters. They say that pressure increase with increasing the height of the glass, and hence the need for thicker glass. Still they are not speaking anything about the increased force on the front, side, and back glasses by increasing the length and width of the tank.  I think that with just increasing the length and width the force that water exerts on all side glasses increase because of higher volume. This should also be considered when picking glass thickness.

18,Need some advise on a career decision,1527909012,"I'm just recently graduated high school and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding just what route I should be taking in the coming years, and I'm hoping some of you can share your experienced advice to help me.
Where should I start, I want to go down a road that splits but eventually merges back together for a career as an Aerospace engineer. 

One path is I go to community/trade school and get a degree in Machine Tool Technology, during my high school years I've taken classes such as precison machining and Robotics as well. It's something I find extremely fun to do, I have experience programming/operating CNC mills/ manual mill and lathe. (As well as a few NIMs certifications to show for it) 
Opportunity wise, I live in Rocket City (Huntsville  Al), plenty of jobs available and definitely not going anywhere as the machinist are in demand. When I mentioned I will eventually end up as an aerospace engineer, in the community college I'm admitted in, I can take general classes cheaper than the general classes at the university also it transfer those credits to the university I will attend and that allows me to focus only on classes that pertain to the aerospace degree. Also I have an easier time paying off the aerospace degree with a machinist job. Only downside is that I'll be in college for a while, which I'm more than willing to meet my end goal.

23,How does an immigrant Engineer gets a work in USA?,1527891920,"Good day everyone. My family recently immigrated to the states running away from our country.

My dad is a Civil Engineer specialized in bridge construction (when he says it sounds better ha!). He is brilliant, graduated in a reputable university in the capital of my country, and has 29 years experience being manager on big projects. 

But that was back home. Now we are here. He got a job designing ship pieces in AutoCad for a small business. But they treat him like crap. They give him more and more responsibility, he draws the pieces, has a control-sheet on Excel to keep track of costs, projects, workers, always solves problems that come out of nowhere, so he is doing a manager's job but can't delegate or freely organize himself. And they always blame every single thing on him, and scream at my old man.  

The thing is, he doesn't speak academic English. He never thought he would need it, in fact, he thought he would need to learn Portuguese because he worked with a lot of Brazilians (before the big scandal of ODEBRECH that is).

So I wonder, is there any hope for him to get another job with all the experience he has, although he doesn't speak english, and doesn't have a degree in the eyes of USA?

However, recently my big cousin, who is a Mechanical Engineer with his Master’s degree, sparked a lot of interest in me. So much so that I found myself watching back to back videos about how car parts work and how airplane engines are made.

I have to admit that even though I have 0 clue about what’s actually happening, it’s extremely interesting for me to think about the fact that, at one point, the car or the airplane or the truck or the rocket was just an abstract idea in someone’s head that they made real by and through engineering and engineering practices. 

My skills tend to go towards writing and art. Reading is something I enjoy and I try to copy the writing styles that grab my attention or captivate me the most. In this way, I’m not a very creative person aside from when I’m painting or sculpting something. This makes me think, immediately, that engineering isn’t for me because I don’t think I’m a naturally inspired or creative girl. 

Essentially, I’m trying to figure out if I’m simply a fan of engineering, or if I want to be a participant. Is there anything you could suggest I do, watch, read, listen to that would help me accomplish this?

The above image is not the exact machine, but it is very similar.

The conveyor in question is the one that has 4 white belts on it and currently has a ply of rubber on it. I am working with the same type of conveyor on a similar machine.

The problem is the belts run at different speeds, and should not. If I mark the bottom left corner of the rubber ply, and also the bottom right corner of the rubber on the 2 outer belts, when the conveyor does a complete cycle, the mark on the right belt will be 8 inches farther than the mark on the left belt.

The belts are running at different speeds but driven by a single motor. The result is rubber being applied unevenly.

Tension on all belts is equal.

Any help appreciated. Thanks

Or if there is a better subreddit for this type of post, please direct me! :)

My biggest problem is my unrealistic understanding of EEE primarily shaped by the media. For example, for me AI meant a career in Robotics. What i've gathered afterwards, it's mostly big data and analythics for security, business, healthcare. 

So i need to get a realistic view on the market but don't know how. What is in demand, what do different EEEs do...

For example, when searching job offers on the internet, I mostly came across embedded, communications and security. Also, all the talks i attended, talked about how AI is in great demand \(I even went to a Medtech conference to see what they have to say and half the conference was about the role of AI in medicine. Nothing about the more practical side\) I am not sure how interesting i;ll find this. If im going to be in medtech, I'm not sure id want to be building better predictions trough AI, I'd rather work on better machinery or prosthetics. 

Then there's optoelectronics which seemed really cool when they showed us the laboratories where Masters and PhDs work. However i have no idea how in demand this is and whether it's mostly in academia. 

I've looked at the modules we'll have to choose from for next years and some look fun such as design, green electronics, robotics, photonics, bionanotechnology and so on. Currently, I'm thinking something in Medtech would be cool. However, this might be just the type of illusions the AI hype has created for me. They sound interesting, but what are the applications in real life. How sought after would they be.  I have no idea what to expect from the real world. Should i look into job offers on the internet and choose modules depending on what is looked for or should i blindly choose cool sounding modules and hope that I get a summer internship within University to gain some experience. I also am not sure whether to switch to Biomedical EE where there's some biochemistry involved or remain on the AI path I've enroled for \(concerning masters degree\). I guess Biomedical would be more academic but that's just a wild guess. Also, what if AI is just a big hype and communications have better future. And I guess all this with the ""future of EEE"" is nonsence but comming from an extremelly low middle class, my parents made sure that having a stable well paid career is implanted deep into my thoughts.

I'd add some triangulation from the top to the legs as well. 

I'd be putting no more than maybe 3600lbs on the shelf, but each tire should be close to the upright. I'm not worried as much about the static ""stored"" situation since the weight of the vehicle should be very close to each upright. 

I'm concerned about the situation where I roll the car from the four post lift onto the shelf, when maybe 2400lbs \(overestimating\) will be rolling over the mid\-point between the uprights. I want an 8x safety factor, so I need to design something that can support almost 10,000lbs at the midpoint of a 10' section that is equally supported.

0,Settling a bet - can I drive a vehicle off the roof of my workplace?,1527718257," Below is the original post, with some mathematical assumptions/mistakes I made. Posting for longevity.

\&gt;I work for a Cadillac dealership, and long story short, we were discussing what it would be like to drive a car off a roof. \&gt;The only thing stopping me, I told them, was the reinforced concrete that stands about 4.5 foot high on our roof. My \&gt;coworkers protested this, stating that an Escalade could easily tear through a wall like that with enough force to be \&gt;completely driven off the roof.

\&gt;So, here's the setup. I haven't measured yet, but I plan to at some point if the results of my guesstimation show that it \&gt;may be possible either way and it comes down to the ""dollars and cents.""

\&gt;We're going to use our biggest vehicle, a Cadillac Escalade ESV. Using the bare minimum weight, one of these weights \&gt;5,831 lbs. Given the distance of our roof, I'm guessing it could accelerate to 60 mph before hitting the aforementioned \&gt;wall. Converting the 60 mph to m/s\^2, I get 26.8224. F=m\*a \(I'm a car salesman so excuse me if there's a better way to \&gt;calculate this\) I get 70,942.43 newtons of Force.

\&gt;Now, here's what I don't know. For the sake of our guesstimations, we're saying the wall surrounding the roof is \&gt;approximately 4.5 feet high, and about 1 foot thick. I believe it is reinforced concrete, so it should contain rebar. How do \&gt;I calculate into an approximate force the amount of resistance a concrete wall of those dimensions can provide? And \&gt;would there be a better formula to calculate this with? Or a better unit to convert to for comparison?

I was asked by r/askphysics to come here, because this may come down more to the structural integrity and impact resistance of a slab of concrete. Unfortunately, I don't have much info. All I can say is that the wall in question is approximately 4.5 ft tall and about 1 foot thick. I haven't had time to run up their to measure but when I do I'll try to restructure this on my own. So for now, I'm simply trying to figure out a hypothetical. At this point, I guess the questions I'm asking are 

 1. How to determine the impact resistance of a 4.5 ft tall reinforced concrete wall that's 1 ft thick.

 2. What unit of measurement am I utilizing to determine this resistance, and what physical force unit can I use against this resistance? Just so I know my units.",AskEngineers,False,Hollowpoint357,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8ncqzl/settling_a_bet_can_i_drive_a_vehicle_off_the_roof/

15,IMU speed tracking through known path,1527696927,"

Hello, new to signal processing and KFiltering here. Thanks for your help.

I working with an IMU for a tracking project where the IMU moves throw a known path but at an unknown speed (within limits), the objective being tracking the speed at which the IMU moved through the path. To my surprise, I couldn't find anything online on IMU tracking through a predetermined path. 

The idea of using the known, 'predetermined trajectory', of the IMU as a constrain makes sense to me, using the path that we know that the IMU is going to travel through as a form of container. But I don't know if there is a flaw in my reasoning or if I'm missing something.

I thought a Kalman filter could be used to merge the accelerometer and gyroscope data and have it constrained to the trajectory as a way to limit sensor noise, but I rly can't get my head around how to do this! Maybe this is an optimization problem where the measured 3D trajectory has to be optimized (or forced) into the 'predetermined trajectory' instead?

Ideally this could be applied to any kind of movement to which the trajectory is known, so I'm imagining this 'predetermined trajectory' as a series of 3D curves.

In reality, the walls will be made of layers of concrete, extruded polystyrene (XPS, roughly styrofoam), and rebar.  I'm wondering if I can treat the walls as a homogenous material with a thermal diffusivity that is an average of the thermal diffusivity of the concrete, XPS, and rebar weighted by cross-sectional area.

So, for example, if the wall's cross-section was 40% concrete, 50% XPS, 10% rebar with a=thermal diffusivity, k=thermal conductivity, p=density, cp=specific heat

a = k/(p*cp)  - definition

I'm a new engineer with sort of an unconventional path....I got a BA in a non engineering field, then moved to a national park for three years, then traveled around the US living out of my car for two years before deciding to enter engineering. I found a company that I loved, basically emailed anyone I could get ahold of to talk about the company, and was eventually hired. I started taking classes at a community college and I will be starting an engineering master's program in the fall.

This last semester I took OChem, Differentials, Statics, and Physics \(102\) while working and while taking care of my mom who had a stroke and learning things like hydrology while on the job at work.. It was an extremely taxing period, but my team has been incredibly supportive throughout this entire process.

This has been documented via email on most occasions. 

Louisiana basically requires you to work under a licensed PE for 4 years (3 if you have a masters degree in an accepted field, which I do). They do say that if you don’t, you can provide an explanation on why you think your experience should still count.

Would like some advice for my sister.,1527627148,"My sister is at a bit of a crossroads in her career \- she's recently completed a BSc in Biochemistry \(about a year ago\) and is now working as an entry\-level laboratory technician for a major food supplier here in the UK. She's not quite where she wants to be just yet, but she does appreciate that jobs are hard to come by as a postgrad so she's done well to get to where she is.

She's currently deciding whether to investigate more specialised careers in her field, or whether she should return to uni/college to complete a Masters or a PhD. Currently, her preference is towards the Masters. It appears that a top\-up course is only a year, so shouldn't be too onerous to undertake. She's of the opinion that it's very hard to get into the more senior biochemical/forensics roles without a Masters or ideally a PhD.

So, my questions to my Biochemistry friends, is my sister correct in her assumption that a Masters/PhD is the better way to go, rather than continuing on the job ladder? 

Also, what's the crossover like between Biochemistry/Bioscience/Biomedical etc \- is there a generic Bioengineering degree that kind of captures everything, that would open up more opportunities for further study? I ask as when I went through education I did Aerospace eng out of high school, then Manufacturing to get my diploma, then Mechatronic to get a higher diploma, and then a final year to top it up to a BSc\(Hons\) in Engineering \- no speciality.

Is there anybody who's actively working in the biochemical field that would be willing to have a chat with my sister \(either phone call if you're local, or perhaps via email/Skype if not\)? I'm sure my sister will be able to ask the more in\-depth questions if anybody is willing to do this, and I'd be happy to wire £10 to you or a charity of your choosing if you feel you can offer her some solid, constructive advice to help her forward in her career. 

I have tried to get her to join me in aerospace but she's having none of it! :\)

We manufacture \(among other things\) components machined from nylon 6/6.

I'm no expert on the mechanical properties of polymers but I think this is going to be a problem.  The original raw material supplier will not test material that we return to them since they don't know what environment it's been in.   From what I've learned via the ASTM standards \(D5989 and D638 for tensile testing\) it sounds like the only ""standard"" tensile testing that can be performed is on newly manufactured nylon with \&lt;0.2&amp;#37; moisture.

 Now if my calculations are correct I wont need a reduction in gearing as I want to utilize the full 1,725 rpm for the stroke speed per second which would work out at about 28 strokes a second, that being both 'throw' and 'retract' so I'd be more like just over 14 strokes a second for one 'full' thrust. Now There's no way on Gods green earth I'd be getting hammered by a metal rod with a dildo on the end at the rate 14 strokes a second in and out that's just silly, which leads me into the second part my my question.

The sex machine already has a power supply box with a speed controler attached to it, so would I be able to just wire up the motor shown in the link above and just plug it straight in to the power supply box and if so sould the controller even manage to control a motor spinning at such high rpm?

As of right now I am suffering from a lack of space on my desk. As such I figured I'd look into the cost of a new desk, however; the room where the desk is located is oddly shaped, making it quite difficult to just get another desk and plop it in to the room and still get full utilization of the room, which I don't at the moment. Due to this issue I decided to look into the use of Plexiglas or acrylic sheets as a surface for the desk and doing some sort of DIY frame to keep it up. My question is then, if i have an area of about 1500x600mm how thick would the Plexiglas have to be in order to withstand a constant mass of lets say 40 Kg to be on the safe side of things? If the desk was shaped like an 'L' where the two sides are equally long, would that change the thickness required to withstand the same mass.

I'm an electrical and electronics engineer. Currently in Middle East. I've recently graduated in 2016. Since then I've done a few internships here and there. But since last month I've been working in telecom sector. But last week I got and call from another company. So I'll describe both my jobs and my opinion. And maybe you guys can help me making a decision.

Telecom job:
I'm currently working as an Drive test engineer. The main responsibilities of my job are basically. Testing newly on air site. They can be lte, 3G or 2g. I'm hired by a sub contractor and out sourced to huawei. My job is mostly in car I rarely visit our offices, once a month maybe.
After doing drives for each sites. I have to email report at the end of the day. 
Pros of this job are that they are paying me double of what the other company is offering. And my job is inside the car, which means I don't have to suffer the extreme weather outside.
Cons there is no concrete timing. I end up working more hours without overtime. And I rarely interact with other people, I get bored. And it's really difficult progressing at this job 
. And another factor is that I'm not a telecom engineer so I don't know how much I can progress in this field.

Now the 2nd job I'm being offered is of site engineer at a construction of a hospital. The company that offering me the job is subcontractor for honeywell. Honeywell is providing all the low voltage system for the building I.e fire fighting system, building management system etc. and we provide wiring, installation and conduiting for these systems 

I will work there as a site engineer. I will be responsible of reading shop drawings and leading a team of electricians and technician.
Cons I'm getting payed half of what I'm getting at the other job.
Pros much more chances of progress. Maybe I'll be a project engineer for some project 
My only concern for this job is that the company is not commissioning the system themselves, honeywell is.

He cannot find a job in his field. He has tried every big company in town, applied for all the jobs that are 90% traveling (or that most people would not want), and even tried to make friends with the small business owners. Still nothing. 

I will admit, he does not have experience. He was unable to get any internships during college due to health reasons, and was able to scrape by to get his degree. However, I feel that anyone letting this fact determine his future is overlooking a great asset (I'm completely biased, but there is also a ton of truth to what I'm saying.)

33,Electromagnet hold strength - decently complex question,1527269468,"Hi Reddit, 

So for some background, I am trying to hold this very thin piece of plastic in a slightly off vertical position. It doesn't weigh much at all (grams), and the solution was to utilize a very low powered electromagnet (lasts nearly 90 hours on AA batteries). 

Now, when we were testing we were really looking at two options:

1) Use an aircore bobbin (eg no iron core, just your typical bobbin), wind the copper wire many times around this bobbin. Then glue a small but powerful magnet on the plastic piece, so when I place the plastic piece in that near vertical position the magnet and electromagnet touch (this was tested and works)

2) Use a bobbin with a iron core to concentrate the magnetic field, then place a magnetic piece on the plastic (but not a permanent magnet like in #1). We couldn't place a permanent magnet on this piece because when we lift the plastic to the near vertical position, we want it to fall back down when the electromagnet is turned off. If it was a permanent magnet on the plastic piece, the plastic would never fall as the magnet is being attracted to the iron core. However, when we placed the magnetic piece on the plastic component, we found that the holding force between the electromagnet and magnetic washer was not enough to hold the plastic component in the near vertical position. 

So my question is ""how much stronger is the holding force between a permanent magnet and an aircore electromagnet, compared to a magnetic material (just a metal washer) and an electromagnet with a ferromagnetic core."" Assuming both electromagnets are the same dimensions. 

Preferably I would like for option #2 to work, but if #1 is offering a much larger holding force because I'm incorporating a powerful magnet then I'm okay with that being the solution (permanent magnet link - 10+ lb holding force https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=DC2-N52).

39,So you want to work for a US Defense Contractor,1527253204,"So imagine you've been asked to create a three course meal \- soup, main course, dessert. You're using a kitchen in a new apartment with new roommates, and they are all going to help. The dessert recipe is one you've never made before, and it's very finicky, including steps like cooling with liquid nitrogen for exactly 23 seconds, and fluffing with a mixer at 300 rpm for exactly 4 minutes. It's all going to be awesome though, and feed a party of thirty.

Sit back. Let me tell you how it goes.

====

You buy all the ingredients and get them to the apartment \- and find out no one actually hooked up the refrigerator. You can't pull it out and plug it in yourself, because for no clear reason it's been bolted to the back wall with a lock. You call to ask the apartment manager to fix this and find out he's on vacation this week.

So you improvise by dripping your liquid oxygen on the perishables. Not a problem, right? You're creative.

You unpack everything else and start stirring ingredients.

One of your new roommate takes the spoon away without warning.

""Sorry. I need it to pry a dead rat out from behind the radiator. Be right back.""

You find another spoon, because, yeah. But the hollandaise sauce has already curdled... ok, start over.

It takes a few second to realise that the gas stove is suddenly burning strangely hot. The flames are really intense all of a sudden. Now why... Oh... the liquid oxygen. Ok, maybe that was a bad move. You turn off the gas burner.

Except the controls don't act the way they did last time. You actually turn it up.

Foosh! Screaming and running for cover, you start cursing about why anyone would mislabel stove controls.

Your other roommate apologises. She's left handed and changed the controls ""so they'd make more sense"" while you were dealing with the dead rat issue. She's sorry she forgot to update the labels...

The first roommate comes back with the spoon. You explain you found another spoon and no longer want the old one near you, ever again.

""Oh... you found the, um, the pink handled one?""

""Yesssss....?""

""I, um, may have used that to scoop a dead raccoon out of the window box.""

""And you didn't WASH it afterwards?! You put it in the drawer!?""

""The process said it has to be cleaned in a dishwasher, but there's no soap yet, so I left it on the counter, and I guess someone else put it away...""

""The process says tools can't be left out when not in use,"" the other roommate pipes in. 

You wash the spoon in the hottest water you can get from the faucet, and start over.

Except now you're out of eggs. You send Roommate One to get more. 

Your mom calls and asks how the meal is going. She mentions in passing that the guest list is up to thirty five.

You acknoledge the change and hang up. You were starting over anyway.

""Wait,"" you suddenly say. ""What... other kitchen things have you use to move dead animals?""

""Um... maybe the measuring cup,"" Roommate Two whines. ""They were going to get us a shovel, but the funding didn't come in...""

""Wash it.""

""Um... is water an acid?""

""What? No. It's neutral.""

""But it ionizes and releases hydrogen ions, right?""

You stare at her. ""You know basic chemistry, but you don't know water is neutral and you think spoons are the best choice for scooping raccoons up? And wait, why does this even matter?""

""The Process says we can't use acids for cleaning.""

Fuming, you wash everything in vinegar, right in front of her. She starts whimpering. ""Stop. Please. The process gods...""

""I'm going to beat you with this spoon until you stop embracing mythology."" 

You don't mean it; you try hard to respect quaint superstitions like... Well, ok, maybe calling them quaint superstitions isn't exactly respect, but you at least try to be tolerant.

""Process is the One True Way,"" she whispers, her voice deepening as she speaks. 

Oh no. You realise belatedly... She's one of THOSE.

Her eyes go black, and start to glow faintly. Out the kitchen window, behind her, you see the sky start to darken eerily towards a primordial purple, and in the distance you hear whip\-poor\-wills, sobbing frantically...

Ok, next time you'll check into roommates a little more deeply before you move in.

""Just kidding. Hear that, Process gods? Haha. Just a joke!""

Lightning flickers outside the window, and the glow in her eyes flickers in time with the flashes. The Process is strong in this one. You brace yourself. But the rumbles fade, and the sky lightens.

Cooking. You're supposed to be cooking. Not trifling with the forces of Hell.

""Anyway, Water is neutral. You can wash things in water. That's really all the dishwasher does.""

""The Dishwasher is holy and does what it pleases,"" she intones, and her eyes start to darken again. ""We do not question the Dishwasher's ways."" 

Right, it is definitely time to get back to cooking, and right now.

The refigerator suddenly starts running. By itself. You're not even going to question this. You put the ice cream into it and close up the liquid oxygen. You take a deep breath and fire up the stove again. Remembering to turn the controls backward. The eggs haven't come yet, but there's the sauces and creams...

Forty five minutes later you're deep in preperation, but you need those eggs. ""Where is Roommate One?""

""You didn't hear? She moved to a different apartment.""

Your mom calls. The guest list is up to fifty, three guests are alleric to dairy, and the meal needs to be ready at 11am.

""Mom, it's 11:30am.""

""Yes dear, can you hurry it up a bit please,"" she said placidly, and hangs up. She worked in Management for a number of years and for her, time is a plastic, mallable concept, unrelated to the real world. Once you asked her about dinner and she said she thought it would be out in the six to nine month timeframe...

Ok, no dairy, and there's certainly no time to make two sets of meals. So the eggs don't matter yet because the hollaindase sauce involved butter. Um... bacon and eggs instead. So you're starting over. You tell Roommate Two to go get bacon.

""Bacon comes from pigs.""

""Maybe. These days who knows. It comes from supermarkets. Fetch!""

""The Process requires kosher foods.""

""Say WHAT? Does this look like a kosher kitchen to you? Did you see the lobster rolls in the bag? The kosher standard got set aside back in\-""

""Process Document 32a still refers to it in a footnote. Footnotes are binding.""

You start scrubbing everything down with salt. She's asking for kosher and the forces of Cthulian Process roil in her eyes when lightning flashes; you're not even going to try to make sense of this. It could be worse. A roommate you've heard of in another apartment makes cobras come out of his ears when he's auditing grocery lists.

""Hi!"" says a new voice. 

Oh no...

""I'm Roommate Three. I got kicked out my last apartment. I'm sorry there wasn't time for interviews and stuff, I was told to move straight in immediately. By the way there's a dead raccoon in the toilet.""

You look at Roommate Two. ""It didn't flush well,"" she explains. ""But the process demands that dead animals be dissolved in acid.""

""And water is acid.""

""Yes. Hydrogen ions.""

""But\-""

You hear a faint rumble of thunder outside, and drop it.

""Pour some vinegar over it,"" you say to Three, handing her the bottle. ""It will dissolve faster."" You doubt this, but you've seen what lightning can do.

""Do you want me to move it to the shower instead? I've got a spoon in my pocket. No problem.""

""I don't see how that will help. But I'm curious. How do you balance a wet, dead raccoon on a spoon?""

""Process,"" TWo and Three say in unison. The lightning flashes again.

The refigerator goes out. Oh. The power went out. It's ok. You learned along ago that electricity is a luxury. The recipie is on your cell phone and the stove is gas, you don't actually need any silly electricity. And \- brilliant moment \- you can store the liquid oxygen IN the fridge, close it, and everything will stay cool! Yeah. You got this. The meal is no longer breakfast, the guest list is up to fifty and you still don't have eggs, but\-

Your mom calls. ""Can we move the meal back to 10:30am?"" she asks serenely.

""Sure. No problem.""

""Thanks, dear."" she hangs up. Serenely. You resolve, no matter what they do to you, you will never go into Management. Death first.

You start boiling the beans, every one of them kosher, in water. Two and Three watch you silently. They're supposed to help...

""Can one of you do the stirring?""

""Yes,"" says Two. She takes the spoon and begins stirring the beans, moving the spoon in a star pattern.

""Stop!"" cries Three. ""Counterclockwise!""

""No!"" says Two. ""The holy pages of process say clearly that it shall be stirred clockwise.""

""Nay! The Process hath been updated! I have the Revised Pages!"" And she waves them in Two's face. You're actually vaguely impressed. You've never quite known where to find any process document, because the location is only described in the process documents. And she just pulled them out of thin air.

""These pages you wave have NOT BEEN SIGNED OFF UPON!""

""They NEED IT NOT! They were written by the Process Queen Herself!""

""Says you, blasphemer!""

For some reason the thunder stays silent. Sure, when you actually NEED it...

The refrigerator hisses, oddly. Probably not important.

You take the spoon back and turn the beans, in a circular fashion, while they scream at each other in a tongue you don't know well, but it has sounds like ""customer contract"" and ""approved practices"" in it. You've never seen a customer; you're pretty sure they are mythical. 

Suddenly they try picking each other up with spoons, and you've had enough. ""Get out of the kitchen! Now!""

They leave, still shrieking obscene phrases involving revision dates and superceding references and the even dreaded oath, Schedule Slip.

Sighing, you turn around, and...

""Hi! I'm Roommate Four! And I don't believe in Process! And there's a dead raccoon in the toilet. I've seen this before. How can I help?""

You decide you believe in angels after all. ""Can you kill roommates Two and Three?""

""Sorry. My powers can only be used for good. Besides, they are aspects of Undying Process. They can't actually be killed. Or even evicted from the Building. But I got Three transferred to another apartment.""

""Wow. Why have I never head of you?""

""Um... as punishment for my effective and process\-free approach, I'm only allowed on doomed projects. And here I am!""

""This project is not doomed,"" you say, with dark determination. ""There will be beans, and chocolate for dessert.""

""MILK chocolate?"" She smiles, serenely. ""And... Your mom's about to call.""

The phone rings. You've learned \- you don't pick up. Four watching you, smiling.

""But now you don't know when the meal is due or how many to feed,"" Four says.

""I never did and I never will. And it never matters. I think the oven works. Heat up the lobster rolls.""

""Um... you can't serve them... even I can't make these look kosher...""

""They're for us.""

She opens the oven, you open the fridge. Oh, that's what the hissing was. The oxygen and gas mix and the resulting explosion blows Four out of the kitchen, and the beans to the ceiling, where they stick, out of each.

""You ok?"" you call.

""Fine,"" she replies. ""Happens a lot. Liquid oxygen for the sorbet?""

""Yeah.""

""You know it's supposed to be liquid nitrogen, right?""

""Yeah. But that's not allowed in the apartment. It's a safety hazard.""

""But they didn't list liquid oxygen. Yup. You're not the first to notice."" She looks in. ""Well... meal's ruined.""

""Yeah. It's ok. I have a plan. Can you get the raccoon out of the toilet?""

""Sure.""

She comes in carrying the wet, dripping, mostly decomposed animal, and tosses it in a bowl. You throw flour on it and pour liquid oxygen over it. ""Baked alaska,"" you explain.

She nods. ""Yup, that'll work.""

""It will? Wait, I won't be evicted?""

""You'll be fine. The guests don't actually know the difference. And only two of them ever show up anyway."" 

She glances at her phone. ""Oh... Three just got an achievement award for her work on this project. Be happy for her. But, um... Two's coming back.""

""Don't you EVER tell her raccoons aren't kosher,"" You hiss. She nods.

""Well! That's settled,"" Two huffs. She looks at the frozen racoon, encrusted in glassy bluish steaming ice. ""Did you stir it in the right direction?""

""Of course!"" you say. ""Could you run it over to the guests?""

""Sure!""

Your mom calls. It's ok to answer, you decide, because you finished your part of the project. ""Hi mom.""

""Eight am and a thousand people?""

""No problem! Everything went to plan and we're shipping on time!""

""Thanks dear!""

You and Four watch Two leave. You just shake your head.

""She has no idea she's serving raccoon, does she.""

""No. She's just happy to have face time with the customer. She'll tell them she worked for hours. It doesn't matter.""

You look out the window; it's noon, getting dark, and the stars are coming out. You're not worried. This happens when Mom calls too many times. It'll sort itself out by morning.

""In a just, fair universe, the guests would notice. Or care. I mean someone should at least care.""

She puts her hand over your mouth. ""Zero! Hush! They'll hear you!""

""They never have before.""

""Not the guests. They're deaf. I mean the Forces. Process, Finance, Legal... they can't ever, ever know that what they specify produces anything but perfection. They would... react. Respond! They'd try to...""

She stutters, going pale, ""...t\-they'd t\-try to invoke the f\-forces of *Change*...""

You shiver. 

It's not really so bad. Yes, there are dead rats in most rooms, and no shovels, and leaking gas stoves because the electricy doesn't always work, and most of the roommates are in touch with arcane, dark forces. Yes, early is on time and on time is late and late is business as usual; and yes there are sometimes mass evicions. But actual *Change*... you saw that once. You still have the nightmares...

""Thank you, Four. I don't know what we'd do without you and those like you.""

She closes her eyes for a long moment, smiles, and opens them. ""Maybe you're about to find out? I've just been evicted.""

""What? No! We shipped! Why?""

""The Landlords found out I violated process again. Two must have seen me handle the racoon without a shovel.""

""But... we never even had shovels..."" Trembling, you choke back sobs. ""And spoons aren't shovels. And\-""

""Zero, no! No tears. This happens. It always happens. It doesn't change a thing. I or my sisters will always be back, somehow and without warning, doing what needs to be done. We'll try to make sure you ship, and maybe even on time! Dry those eyes and fill out Project Report Short Form Three. Remember to add that the Baked Alaska Process is OSHA\-compilant, follows the DoD roadmap and had no EX/IM violations. Add a copy of Session 2, chapter 247 of the 40th congress record of 1868 so they know Alaska isn't a foreign power. And check all the boxes on page 17, always and regardless. There's a brave Zero.""

""Can \- can I please go with you?""

""No, Zero. I'm returning to a higher plane. Commercial. The rumors are true. The electricity is always on there. But you can't come yet. Someday...""

She fades. 

You get an email about Three's achievement award. And sigh. Tomorrow is another apartment, another meal. Same situation, different day.

You shut down the oven, hang the Not In Use/Secured sign on it, load and start the holy dishwasher, and do the kitchen sweep. All clear. You lock up the apartment, and nod wordlessly to some other tenants. Looks like it's going to be another Crown Royal Black evening. Skip the soda. Skip the ice. It's at least a project that you know will go to plan.

42,Starting out as a Field Engineer?,1527241647,"Hello! I recently obtained my bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from an ABET accredited University. I was not able to get any good internships so my experience is lacking. I graduated with a decent GPA and very soon will take the FE exam. The field in EE for which I wanted to base my career on was Power Systems. After months of applying to jobs I received an offer to work as a field engineer. The job mostly entails on working with protective relays at substations. The pay is quite good for a recent EE grad and it includes great benefits. My main gripe is that the job sounds more like a technician role. When I asked about the potential of later moving on to a designing role I was told it was possible but that most people in such position prefer to stay as a field engineering due to the better pay. 

Has anyone else began their career similar to this? Currently my options seem to be to pass the FE exam and search for a designing role or stick with the offer I have and hopefully network myself to a designing position after several years.

45,Great job with an interesting situation (career advice),1527213760,"Civil/environmental engineer here with 5 years experience and recently received my PE. 

A little about myself, I graduated with a degree in Environmental Engineering, concentrating in water and waste water treatment. I spent the first few years of my career in the W/WW world before being asked to move to environmental and storm water engineering. Spent 2 years doing stream restorations, BMP designs, storm collection, etc.  I finally decided to get back to my roots of W/WW and took a job with a firm as a jack of all trades civil engineer. Today I’m designing a subdivision, tomorrow it’s on to a water treatment system study (literally this is the case). I love it and love my coworkers. I’ve been learning a lot and growing as an engineer.  Additionally, I have a wife and we live in the south east. We are about to start a family and all of our family is here, which also anchors us a bit.

My company decided to send me to a conference now that I am registered. Fun fact about me, I’m an atypical engineer, I am completely an extrovert and love talking to people and it’s helped me gain a pretty solid foundation of contacts and clients in my few short years.

While at this conference I met a gentleman  (41)  (with a very similar personality to myself) who had worked on similar projects. Throughout the week we had many conversations and bonded a bit and became friends. On the last night (after a few beers) he told me he’s a 10% principal owner of a firm in the Midwest. He follows this up asking if I’d be interested in moving to the Midwest to become his protege.  He divulged a lot of internal financials including revenue and profits.

In most situations I graciously thank him and move along because I truly love my job. But this was different. Me and this gentleman had a vibe and I have a good gut feeling about it. My wife is unwilling to move to the Midwest so I’m considering sending out feels to be a remote engineer for their team with the prospective idea that we’d create a east coast office ran by me in a few years. 

I figure my idea is so far fetched he’d walk away. My concern is if he says yes. Do I want to leave a great gig and great people? Or do I take a huge risk being a lone wolf trying to expand a brand I don’t know yet.

And that is in reference to the Woods Valve designed in 1891.

All references I can find show pneumatic tires being developed in their current form by Dunlop, using a variation of an earlier design that had multiple inflated bands. But what sort of valves (and pumps) would have been used to inflate these tires over the next 3+ years until the Schrader and Wood's valves existed?

Did they use something similar to what a basket-ball uses?

I did find this thread with pictures of very early valves, and how to install them in tubes, but they appear to just be early Schrader Valves to me: https://thecabe.com/forum/threads/early-pneumatic-tire-valve-stem-install.110759/

I'm not sure how to broach the subject because it will inevitably boil down to cost versus benefit. The cost is very much a known quantity but the benefits are not.

i am having real difficulty deciding what testing to perform for an osseointegrated prototype. The design is for the humerus with falling modelled as a straight arm at 70deg from the ground. From the literature we found the max force to be 25kN and assumed the arm length (from hand to middle of pin) to be 400mm. For this, due to the long moment arm, bending moment will be the greatest stress on the pin causing it to break. However, having trouble determining which testing would be ideal for this prototype. Initially, i thought 3 point, as it's under bending. However, we have to perform on the pin only, so is a 3 point bend test relevant still and if so does it need to be scaled somehow (because we don't have the arm length) or is that already taken into consideration when using the maximum bending moment in the calculation (sig = My/i).

67,Non-engineer in over my head on a project,1527133513,"I work in low level management at a company. We've built something that mounts to the exterior of a building for one of our customers. Normally, this requires a permit from my city unless its replacing something existing. A new permit would certainly require an engineer's approval however if installed in a typical fashion we're able to use a guide book of installation practices which suffice. We usually just assemble various components together and then install in accordance to the guidelines. This particular project kind of got away from us and we've had to build/order something extremely custom and its basically all been by my design. The design however isn't an exact match to the guide book which is where my concern comes from.

What I'm worried about are any small things I've missed such as improper metals or fasteners used. We're set to install soon and I've just been worried sick about the project and the responsibility of what I've made. I reached out to an engineer in the industry however they've quoted a very high amount for the project. I'm trying to get other quotes but the stress and anxiety are killing me. I don't think what we've made is of any risk of falling apart but on the off chance it does.. I don't want to hurt anyone. I have also fallen out of favor with this particular customer over challenges on this project. The other issue is that they are still a huge customer to one of our other divisions. I've been trying to just push this project through but the closer we get to installing, the more I worry.

As for the construction itself, its essentially several large aluminum boxes fastened together along the top. The total weight is about 200 lbs and spans maybe 15'. The boxes are mounted along a top rail onto some aluminum angle for support. That support aluminum angle will eventually fasten on another piece of 1/8"" aluminum angle which is secured to the building. Any advice, direction, or suggestions would be so extremely appreciated. I just feel extremely trapped and anxious without knowing what to do.

TLDR: I'm a ball of stress over something I've made which likely needed an engineers review. Extremely worried about being responsible for it.

So I've been working at a plant for about 8 months now since I graduated and I want to troubleshoot and improve a process, but I'm not sure how to proceed. For background, I'm working at a large facility on the west coast and this plant produces plastic (propylene, ethylene, misc, one of these).

1.) Reducing waste and recycle more

In this aspect, a lot of times when we have to change production (size/thickness/color), we run the extruder empty to purge the system (plenty of waste). We also have 4 feeders to this extruder set to different sized powders, and only one of these can feed recycled elements unfortunately. I want to increase recycle, but for one, we don't produce enough recycle since we run at a 80%+ yield. I looked into changing the equipment we have to incorporate more recycle, but capital investment is already off the charts so we won't be buying or replacing these feeders. Also, are there any literature on plastic engineering since this is still fresh for me since I'm the only engineer at this site currently.

83,I need a little engineering input/ feedback,1527112095,"I need some help/input from someone who is knowledgeable in general engineering principles.

Ok... so long, story short: A large Moving Van accidentally (slightly) backed into the front portion of my home. (I was driving said van. Ooops) The damage isn't too bad and I included some pictures and diagrams below to help you visualize the issue. Basically, one of the wooden frames (marked A) was was pushed backwards about 2"", which pulled another piece of frame (marked B) moved backwards about 1"".... but the bricks and everything are still intact. 

Overview of the Impact hit: https://i.imgur.com/gAl2BpT.png

Closer view of damage with notes: https://i.imgur.com/lCYiXHD.png

It's pretty clear to me that I can ""pull"" the wood (marked A) back into position, as shown below. 
https://i.imgur.com/vLvN2JQ.png

I also know that if I can move A back into position, B will move with it. (I smacked A a few times with a big hammer and it moved about 1/8"" back to where it should be, but it's pretty clear to me that smashing this with a hammer isnt the right solution because the entire wall was vibrating from the impacts.)

My new idea is to use a winch to SLOWLY pull the offending piece of wood back into position - but I will need to build some type of frame with 2x4s or 4x4s (and two pulleys) because if I just attach the Winch to the damaged piece of wood (A)... the winch/ cable would pull the wood ""down"" instead of horizontally ""forward"".

So... I could build a box frame like this: https://i.imgur.com/cd1hJS7.png

Basically I am not sure what type of frame would be best.

Maybe I should do something fancier? https://i.imgur.com/mO6v1ng.png
But that seems more for lifting than pulling... So maybe the triangle should be sideways, pointing away from the house?

My main concern with the box frame is that it might want to tip towards the house when I exert pressure (as shown in the image below), but I could be over-thinking it.
https://i.imgur.com/cuUeMJg.png

Ok... so that's it. Hopefully one of you engineering ninjas can point out any flaws in my plan, or a better approach. I am pretty sure my box frame idea would work, but I am also worried about pulling the front of my house off, which would be bad. LOL

We used the method of Blüm to calculate and design the dolphins. Blüm states for berthing manoeuvres the load only applies for a very short time. Therefore we can use the effective weight of the wet ground. For mooring we only consider the effective weight (wet ground minus the weight of water).

Now the contractor proposed to use a p - y method and the government agreed. They will use a static model instead of a dynamic model. The contractor uses the effective weight (wet ground minus the weight of water) for both mooring and berthing maneuvers; and refers to a PIANC publication of 1984. Using the effective weight (wet ground minus the weight of water) will give bigger and longer piles.

IS there any literature to calculate the berthing maneuvers with a p-y method?

I've really have regretted my nuclear degree ever since \(I should have been a mechanical and just taken some nuclear specific classes\).

Anyway, it's looking like there will be layoffs coming to my job pretty soon. I'm in a small town with few engineering opportunities and my girlfriend is about to move a few states away from home to live with me while she finishes school. She's already accepted to a university here so we can't really leave and chase whatever job I can get. I really want to try to break out of the nuclear industry but it seems hard given my degree. I'm updated my resume and trying to really emphasize that the work I've been doing at my job has nothing to do with nuclear and is more related to mechanical or lab work. I know at some point I want to get my masters in mechanical but its not something I believe I can do if I get laid off since my girlfriend hasn't started her career yet.

22,Taking a semester off before graduate school - what should I do?,1527025885,"Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a weird situation, but I'll try to strip it down to the basics.

My girlfriend lives in Denmark, so I've been focusing on moving there over for the last two years - I absolutely love it there. I'm about to take my last exam on Friday, after which I'll be a free soul for the rest of the year. My plan is to apply for jobs in Denmark so that I can move there, and if I don't get anything, I'll start graduate school there in spring 2019. Graduate school is something I want to do and was considering anyways - I'm just a little burnt out right now.

So, essentially, I'm taking a semester off. My question is: how should I be filling this time meaningfully?

An engineer I know is currently trying to line up an internship or a job for me, and while he's ""guaranteeing"" that I'll get something out of it, it's possible that I won't. Internships are 100% what I'm focusing my efforts on right now, as they're temporary and I won't be burning any bridges by only staying for a few months. That said, I've applied for about 50 internships on my own already and got turned down for everything. Maybe I could just try to get a job instead, but then leave it after a few months at the risk of burning bridges?

I could also just do nothing and take a break. I can finally find time to work on hobbies that I've put aside for four years, and I can work on my own projects and soft skills to enhance my resume. I won't get any income from this, though, and I feel like my debt would bite me in the ass and it would generally be a waste of 7 months of my life.

I can also get a part-time job, but I don't see the point in that if I can just look for an internship or something.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? I'm just worried I'm overthinking this, so I'm looking for some feedback and potentially some advice.

To be clear, I plan on being with my girlfriend by the end of the year - so any long-term commitments here in the US wouldn't work unless something changes with my relationship.

27,Having a really hard time deciding between switching my major from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science. Hoping for some advice,1527017306,"Sorry in advance for the long post. TLDR at the bottom tho.

Hi reddit so I am currently a mechanical engineering major transferring from community college to university this coming fall and I am at a crossroads. I am right now trying to decide if I want to stay in mechanical engineering or switch to computer science.

 

So let me give you some brief background but if you don’t care for it and just care about my opinions on both majors then skip the next two paragraphs.

 

So I didn’t originally declare as a mechanical engineering major because I had any passion for engineering or math or physics for that matter. I chose it because I was somewhat decent at math and I thought I could challenge myself and get a degree that will get me a good paying job with a good work life balance.

 

Even though I did not love what I was studying it didn’t matter, because there really weren’t any fields out there I was passionate about. They say do what you love, but all I love to do is enjoy myself by going out and seeing movies and spending time with close friends and family, playing video games and reading books, working out etc. etc. Basically I feel the same sort of interest for M.E as I would for any other engineering or any other subject for that matter.

So I was hoping maybe some of you guys can help me decide. Help me see more clearly.

 

So I am basically picking my future career path for a few reasons

1.      Work/Life Balance
2.      Money (I know some of you guys don’t like to hear it when somebody picks there major just for money but for me it’s a very big factor)
3.      Industry options i.e I don’t have to be stuck working in one industry like say chemical engineers mainly working in petroleum.

 

Here are my views on mechanical engineering:

1.       I enjoy the math and problem solving.
 
2.      Creating tangible things from scratch sounds so appealing to me but I feel for the most part that isn’t what mechanical engineers do especially when they work in big companies.
 
3.      It seems the pay for mechanical engineer’s peaks at much lower rates than those who work in software.
 
4.      It also seems that most or at least a lot of mechanical engineers end up leaving engineering anyway, usually into management or other more business type positions after a decade or so.
 
5.      I am aware also that a M.E can always learn how to program and career change to
something software related while the same cannot be said for computer science majors vice versa. But is it really worth it and I already know for fact it’s going to be way more difficult to break into the software industry as a M.E no matter how much self-study in programming I do.
 
6.      I may enjoy math but I cannot say the same for physics. The stuff you learn in physics is cool and all but I saw the class more as a chore. I had no interest in what I was doing, and the problems I was solving.
 
7.      This semester I took statics as well which I hear is a big indicator in whether you will want to do M.E or not and again, I don’t love it or hate it, it just felt like something I had to take, almost a chore to get through.
 
8.      I was not a fan of using solid works and one of the things I dread is ending up a CAD monkey. Using the program every now and then is ok I guess but It’s one of my least favorite aspects of M.E. but maybe that is due to the fact my teacher wasn’t even all that great (all he did was give us a textbook that taught us how to step by step do each assignment and then we did them and turned them in. That’s it) I’ve also heard not all M.E’s use CAD in their jobs anyways, I am aware it’s a broad field.
 
9.      Lastly doing labs in classes like physics and chemistry always felt like such a chore for me. Others in my class were enthusiastic about them but I felt like I had to drag my miserable self through them to get them done. So basically, I am one of those guys who thinks the idea of working with tangible things and building things is awesome but in actuality It may just not be for me.

10. I will say that of all the physics I’ve taken, mechanics always clicked with me the most.

 

So here are my views on CS:

1.       Again I actually really enjoy math and I think CS and math go hand in hand while engineering, especially M.E. is more geared towards physics.
 
2.       I have taken two programming classes, python and Java, my professors for both sucked so I found myself not loving programming but certainly not hating it. In fact there were times where I enjoyed the puzzle solving nature of what I was doing.
 
3.       The pay right out of undergrad is much higher than M.E
 
4.       Up and coming fields like A.I, machine learning, and data science all seem appealing to me
 
 
5.       I’ll be honest, sitting in a cubicle all day coding is not ideal but once again, it doesn’t really matter to me in the grand scheme of things as long as I can get a good work/life balance and make a decent wage.
 
6.       Computer science projects beats physics labs any day of the week for me.
 
7.       I’m also concerned that the market for computer science will soon become over saturated since there is a lot of hype regarding the major and perhaps it will soon be much harder to find work and the pay will decrease.

 

So if you read through all that I thank you. I know it may seem from reading it that I already made up my mind and want to switch to CS but maybe some of you guys can still convince me that engineering is the way to go. Or maybe some of you guys can give me a reality check on CS.

Not really looking to double major or minor or anything like that. I want to decide between the two

Once again thank you again for reading

 

TL;DR: Been studying mechanical engineering for past few years, transferring from Community College to university now and having second thoughts. Thinking about switching to Computer Science, not sure what to do and hoping for some advice.

28,"An idea i had for Guitar Cables, need some advice",1527017031,"So my friends and i have a bad habit of collecting guitar pedals and experimenting with new sounds ( like most guitarists). We have noticed that many of us have the same issue, being that when our Pedal boards suddenly stop working , we have to literally tear apart the entire board to locate either the faulty Patch cable , faulty pedal, or faulty power supply,  9/10 times it's going to be one of the patch cables in between the pedals that has gone bad, this process can take upwards of an hour  to tear down and set back up ( sometimes guys have 10-15 pedals ).     
We have been experimenting with the Idea of implementing a small LED light on each side of a patch cable, that would .. in theory .. indicate a few things to the player
1) Light would be on if the signal is active 
1) the direction of the signal using 2 different lights ( think red means out , blue means in)
2) the strength of the signal determined by brightness of the LED ( Maybe?)

My first concern as a guitar player, is how is the LED being powered , can a copper instrument cable supply enough power  to small LED ?  these cables are plugged into Guitar Pedals ( usually like 6 inches long if that ) that are power usually by 9V AC adapters or some sort of power supply attached to the rig.  
What i don't understand is , can a copper cable that is used to connect 2 pedals carry enough ""current"" to power a LED ( or 2 ) on the cable without it affecting the original Signal ( the acoustic guitar signal)?

54,Should I go into an industry in which I have no interest for?,1526947676," I graduated last year and have been working for about half a year now in the aviation industry as a technician. Unfortunately, this role does not do much engineering work and is primarily assembly, disassembly, and troubleshooting. I do not really enjoy my job and don't find it very challenging so I'm starting to look at other options. I found an engineering technician role that does similar things to what I am currently doing, but with added engineering elements \(CAD, CNC, etc.\). The downside is, it is in the pipe manufacturing industry, and I don't think that I would enjoy it at all as I have no interest in it.

As a side note, reviews of the company seem to indicate that this will be a low paying job for the amount of work you do, with no real chances for growth within the company, and bad management/organization.

58,Heat transfer: Calculating temperature profile from edge to center of a part vs. time in a furnace?,1526944304,"Hi guys, I have been tasked with calculating the temperature profile vs. time of a metal cube from outside edge to center when it is being heat treated in a furnace. 

This is a ballpark estimate, so I am allowed to make as many assumptions as possible to make this solvable by hand/in a spreadsheet.

Assumptions:

* One dimensional
* Plane wall
* Steady state
* No heat generation
* Only conduction occurs

Knowns:

* Mass
* Length/dimensions
* Coeffecient of thermal conductivity vs. temp
* Specific heat capacity vs. temp
* Heat treat cycle (ramp rates (°F/hr), hold temps)

I originally wanted to solve this using the one dimensional, steady state solutions to the heat equation with no generation as follows:

Temperature distribution 

T(x)=T_1,s-ΔT*(x/L) 

Where T_1,s is outside wall temperature, ΔT is change in temperature from outside wall to inside, x is distance from edge and L is the full distance from edge to center of the part.

Heat rate

q=k*A*(ΔT/L)

Where k is the coeffecient of thermal conductivity, A is cross sectional area, ΔT is change in temperature from outside wall to inside, and L is the full distance from edge to center of the part.

Then the following can be rearranged for time:

q=m*c_p*(ΔT/t)

Where m is mass and c_p is specific heat capacity.

This would work if the temperature wasn't also changing with time from the ramp rate, and I am unsure how to capture the difference in the internal temperature vs. position that happens because of this. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, and alternative approaches are very welcome!

I'm close to finishing my Master (in Europe) in EE (antennas, electromagnetics) and I have already decided to go on with a PhD. I feel like there's a lot of controversy on this topic, I know a lot of people (and it can be proved just by looking at posts on reddit) who do the PhD just because they like what they do, thinking that by staying in university a few more years will give them knowledge/experience. The result of this is an incredible amount of low quality papers (I guess that I can't prove it, you gonna have to see it for yourself and judge, this is only my opinion). The only thing that really matters is people, the professors, your colleagues; the name/ranking of the university has nothing to do with the quality of the teaching (might be proven wrong, I myself am studying in a top 30 university, I don't want to go deeper in the subject). 

A few months ago I've spoken to a guy, he told me that universities in the US prepare you for the job, if you want to get a Master degree it's your choice, but it will only increase your chances of having luck when you're looking for a job. Far point, one could say, but I believe it completely misses the point of higher education. My truth is that 4 or 5 years cannot possibly enough to study something properly, especially if you spend 80% of your time learning the basics. People who complain they don't use math in their work, is it because your company is exploiting you? Is it because they know you're young and energetic?

So, for example, imagine a 50' long shear wall with a 7' high south edge and a 14 foot' high north edge.  Of course, there are openings in various spots.

I thought about using the mean roof height, since that is what you typically use for seismic analysis.  But sometimes, chopping off some of the height causes my openings to not fit (imagine large window openings that go near the roof on the tall end).

I've heard from another engineer that it's conservative to use the maximum roof height.  That gives you the maximum wind load and moves your diaphragm up to a larger moment arm from the base.  But this gives me more stiffness above the openings on the short end.

And of course, I've thought about just drawing an OSB plate, but I'm not sure how I feel about that and if it'd be accurate.  Either way, an OSB plate wouldn't calculate hold down forces - and that's something I really like about RISA.

81,Need help creating a DC Circuits exhibit,1526882960,"My partner and I are working on a science exhibit for physics, and we chose to pick DC Circuits as our topic. Our idea was to create an interactive table where there is a complex circuit of copper wires laid out, with one fixed-voltage battery hooked up and various nodes across the circuit that interfere between a wire. In these nodes, students may put in components (such as resistors, capacitors, and lightbulbs) and the goal is to experiment and see how those components interact with each other in different configurations. 

The problem is that we need a safeguard to protect the components from short circuiting, since the components can be rearranged in any combination. We were thinking about adding a pressure plate beneath each node to detect if a component is placed on top of it, and we determine the weight of each component by measuring its force so we can distinguish the type of component set on the plate. How can we design this setup so that NO current will flow from the battery when there is not a valid setup?

I will probably end up replacing the unit with a smaller one, since I heard smaller is better for dehumidifying. in the mean time, I wonder if there is anything I can do to improve the current one's ability. 

I think the issue is that the unit can only condense so much water per minute, and being so over-powered, it does not spend a long enough period of time running before it reaches the set temp and turns off.

I was thinking that perhaps unplugging one of the fans inside the unit would make less air flow, but the condensation would still occur at a similar rate. the unit would spend more time cycling air to reach the set point, allowing more condensation to occur.

what do you guys think? does my logic make sense?

91,1 HVAC training online or classes recommendations please? looking for advice and training to get into data center work,1526866828,"Hi,

I am wondering how does one get training on hvac from online or classes where one can learn HVAC.

To give additional info, I am a mechanical engineer and I want to try and move towards datacenter jobs, specifically HVAC cooling in these data centers. I am currently at a completely different industry, however I want to use my time to see if I can put the time and effort to learn the concepts and prepare myself for an entry level or any level engineer for a datacenter pos. (think facebook, google, microsoft, etc.).

If there is anyone here who is familiar with datacenter, what can you advise so that I can prepare and train myself for it? I see this industry as a tremendous opportunity and a challenge for mechanical engineering, since more and more people will use the the internet, and data centers will only get bigger and hotter. It is a challenge already to cool these centers, and I see this as a huge  potential for mechanical engineers.

For example, I am seeing that a position a mechanical engineer  to work at a datacenter requires:

'Knowledge of HVAC system, Chilled Water Systems, Condenser Water Systems, Pump controls, Glycol/Glycols, AHU units (DX, split, RTU, CRAC, etc.), CRAC, Raised Floor Systems, HOT/COLD aisle containment, Building Management System'

What do I need to do to prepare myself and learn all the concepts for HVAC? Is there a book, online training, classes,etc. I could do to prepare and learn the material?

My issue is that from time to time I feel overwhelmingly guilty about wasting my degree.

Are they talking about utilizing large assemblies? It seems it has all the design and simulation capabilities that Solidworks has. Does 360 do all of the calculations in the cloud? The reason I ask this is because I would like to buy a smaller laptop for travel but it's hard to find small thin laptops that can run programs like Inventor or Solidworks thereby compelling the user to purchase big bulky and otherwise expensive laptop machines.

1,"I love aerospace, but am not developing as an engineer.",1526845607,"Hello,

I'm a mechanical design engineer with 2 years experience at one of those big ol' aerospace companies. 

At first, my job was really awesome because they gave me this really cool design project. As far as I know, I did very well with that project. Got everything done on time and did my own analysis to ensure that it only went through stress verification once. Of course I made mistakes, but I was always able to recover and get my shit back on track. Management seemed Saturdays.

But since that ended, my job has been damn near 90% paper work. Even the ""engineering tasks"" haven't been very engaging.

I believe that this is happening because there is no real design work to be done, but only sustainment work for old equipment. 

I'm at a point where the work feels very basic and repetetive, and I'm not growing as an engineer or professional.

Should I count my lucky stars that I am even in aerospace and just keep chugging, or should I consider leaving the industry to seek more technical work that allows me to develop and grow as an engineer? I'm wondering how hard it would be too get back into the industry later, if I leave to seek some meaningful professional growth.

I would guesstimate 45mph winds are not uncommon where I live. But it shouldn't get much stronger than that. The antennas are very directional, so ideally I would like to minimize sway but I also don't want to use guy wires. I also would like to be able to use a flag (So it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb)

Also, my dad once filled a home made steel flagpole with cement to make it sway less, would that make things better or worse? 

The antenna would be positioned near the top.

44,How to stop being terrified of job interviews?,1526669708,"Hello everyone

I'm a fresh grad in Computer Engineering (I'm actually walking Saturday!) and I've always had problems with interviewing. I have a pretty decent resume and get plenty of responses to applications, but when I head back from companies, I freeze completely.

For instance, I recently applied to an entry level firmware and OOP gig that I knew I was a solid fit for. I got an email and a call back the literally the next day from a recruiter asking to set up an interview time. I intentionally let it go to voicemail and I still have not replied to the email.

A couple months ago I got contacted by a major defense contractor that I've always wanted to work for (Rhymes with Cocksleeve Fartin). I shit the bed completely on super simple C++ concepts during the phone interview and was not called back for an in person interview. I am a major C++ open source contributor and study new additions to the C++ STL for fun. This is not something I should have struggled with whatsoever.

I don't know why I do this. I think I suffer from imposter syndrome. It's also kind of daunting walking into an interview thinking ""Welp, this will determine whether or not I'll be a bum living on the streets or not"", as I'm pretty deep in student debt.

Interview questions from my experience also seem to be completely arbitrary and not necessarily related to the job description, so I'm unsure of how to prepare most of the time. This especially applies to software gigs.

55,Need feedback on rather complex project idea - suspended magnet,1526627652,"After looking at several implementations of magnet suspender systems using microcontrollers, I have thought of a design which might tackle some of the frequent issues. I wrote it down here hoping that someone might point out mistaken assumptions, suggestions, any critique.

**Physical setup**

Electric magnet on a scaffold, one hall sensor at the top and the bottom of the magnet. The scaffold holds a platform which - like an elevator - can move up and down. The platform has a scale (load cell + amplifier) at the center, holding a permanent magnet.

**Why the platform?**

 - Hall sensor calibration: assuming the upper sensor mostly measures the magnetic field strength of the electric magnet, and the lower sensor measures some combination of the suspended magnet field and the electric magnet field. Then I can subtract the lower reading from the upper one, yielding the isolated measurement of the lower sensor. However, I can do it with a lookup table too:


    for vertical_position in lower:step:upper {
        drive_platform(vertical_position);
        for magnet_force in 0:100 {
            drive_magnet(magnet_force);
            lookup_matrix[magnet_force][upper_reading][lower_reading] = vertical_position;
        }
    }


 - Magnet effective force calibration: The force of the electric magnet on the suspended one is highly non-linear. It behaves like ``(mu(q1*q2))/(d^2)``, where ``mu`` is (roughly) 1 in air, ``qm1``, ``qm2`` are the magnetic field strengths of point poles, and ``d`` is the separation between the two. But that force can also be measured using the load cell! So I could do this:

    for vertical_position in lower:step:upper {
        drive_platform(vertical_position);
        for weight_reduction in -100:100 {
            power = drive_magnet_to_reduction(weight_reduction);
            lookup_matrix[vertical_position][weight_reduction] = power;
        }
    }

**Problems so far**

 - Do I need closed-loop control for the magnetic field strength? I could use the upper hall sensor for that.

 - If I drive the magnet using PWM, that might mess up my hall sensor readings. If the magnetic field strength at the lower sensor really behaves like superposition, I should be fine, but I don't know. Oscilloscope tests will show.  To solve this, I might have to time the sampling of the hall sensors to be during PWM off phase.

 - Should I use the lookup matrices with interpolation or infer a mathematical compensation formula based on the measurements? In the first case, I could calibrate for a new magnet simply by running it through the procedure. In the second case I could not, I would have to first adjust the interpolation parameters

 - How to best do the position control of the platform? I was thinking of using resistive wire between the top and bottom plates in a voltage divider configuration where the wire is divided at the platform to measure the position. But it seems most resistive wire has a rather low resistance or length. That should not be a problem, with a voltage divider. Not sure how to do position feedback.

The actuators driving the platform can be threaded rod + continuous rotation servo

 - Which hardware should I use? I am thinking of using a teensy 3.5, it has an FPU, PWM plenty, ADCs plenty. Other options?

**Control**

I would go for standard PID control here. The output is assumed linear, but with the lookup tables (or multiplying by the square of distance) I can sort of compensate for nonlinearity.

**NOTE**

This can probably be simplified a lot by not using the calibration platform and playing around with the values. However, I am intrigued by the concept unless someone reasonably convinces me that it is unnecessary or infeasible.

To put it another way, would you as an engineer, be willing to sign off and send to production a design that had only been tested in simulation? Would you buy such a car and drive your family around in it?

The vehicle laws where I live (Ontario Canada) state that a home built vehicle must still pass the emissions laws in effect in the year I apply for the VIN.

I'm trying to find a material in 10' wide rolls which has the following properties:
Able to withstand 100mph wind when suspended at 45 degree angle to the wind by 2' spaced bungees
Waterproof
Reflects 90%&gt; radiant heat
Will operate for a minimum of 5 years alternating being stored in a shipping container folded for 11 months and exposed to sun, alkali, fine dust, and heavy (max 100 sustained, sometimes higher winds for the remaining month.
Must not shed material

Near as I can tell this means an aluminum coated material of some kind with the best candidates being a thick (~600gsm) PE or Vinyl, or possibly a ballistic nylon/aramid weave, with a protective coating over the aluminum layer. The tricky part for me is that I'm no material scientist, and so determining exactly what would be the best for my needs (and even worse, where to buy it) has been rather difficult. A thermally reflective durable coating that could be applied to vinyl would be also great if such a thing existed, as I already have a great deal of recycled heavy vinyl.

My overall budget is up to 5k for 15 8'x10' and 10 10'x10' finished tarps with grommets, but obviously less would be better - for the full 5k I'd want these things to be damn near indestructible.

The context:
I'm building a large shade structure for a smallish 20-person camp of volunteers out in the Nevada desert for a certain notorious festival. We've been using a design that calls for a series of 8'x10' and 10'x10' tarps to use as the shade, hung between a metal frame with bungies.

Originally we used the standard polypropylene tarps, however these were not terribly heat reflective, generated a ton of noise in the wind, and tended to shred and fail catastrophically in extremely high winds. Currently we're using recycled billboard vinyl with a layer of radiant barrier attached via contact cement, but this is a rather improvised solution and we've discovered recently that the foil part of the radiant barrier is unprotected and becomes brittle, flaking off over time.

I work closely with a high school program that operates a senior-design design course for pre-engineering students.

The internet has a wealth of knowledge, but they spend an inordinate amount of time seeking help only to come to the wrong answer - very often because their internet resources are unreliable or incorrect.  We are hoping to settle on a set of well-respected texts that we can purchase for this classroom to have on hand, so that students can more quickly solve basic equations and systems in order to move on to the more challenging problems their projects demand.  Some of our most important criteria include:

* **Approachable:**  Book is written age appropriate for beginner college students, comes with well-crafted diagrams, and contains relevant example problems.
* **Vetted:** Book comes from a reliable, preferably academic-standard source.
* **Durable:** Book is made to stand up to time by careful, but many hands (example: not like the latest CRC Reference Manuals)
* **Bonus:** Comes with a solution manual for instructors

Essentially I'm in a job situation that I don't like, and I'll fill you in on my background.  I graduated a few years ago with a BS in Mechanical Engineering from a state university.  I initially got a job with an aerospace related company in the Milwaukee area.  It was interesting work, and it was very challenging but several things happened that influenced my moving on.  The first is several other facilities across the U.S. closed, and our facility was struggling to even get into the black and had for several years, we where all afraid for our jobs.  The second is the turn over rate was extremely high, this was largely due to management causing extremely bad morale.  Finally it was an extremely political and toxic environment, I didn't want to have to cover my own but.  So I worked there for just under two years before moving to a new company in the same area.  I was told that this new position would deal with making production better, that I would be doing time studies, taking part in lean activities, actively searching for improvements, etc.  Instead I find myself in a job that is literally just copying data from excel sheet to excel sheet all day long.  I hate it, and I feel mislead as to what the position was.  I've brought up to my boss that this seems to be largely data entry and I got the distinct impression that he does not care.

24,Renewable engineering career: Multiple questions within,1526479413,"I am considering doing an MSc in Renewable Energy Engineering at The University of Aberdeen. 

One thing I lacked when choosing my undergraduate degree (BEng Mechanical Engineering) was a long term career goal. Now that I have graduated and am struggling to get a job I want, I feel it is time I seriously considered my long term career goals.

I have decided I want to work in the renewable engineering industry. For this reason, as mentioned above, I am thinking of attaining a masters in the subject and applying to the ""big 6"" energy firms in the United Kingdom. 

My question is to ask you, engineers in the energy/renewable industry, what your jobs are like on a day-to-day basis? Do you feel like you are contributing to the renewables/energy industry through your work?

There are 4 careers listed on the Aberdeen University web page for this MSc:

Corrosion Engineer,
Energy and Sustainability Adviser,
Project Engineer and
Risk, Safety and Environmental Engineer.

My 2nd question is: What other careers would be feasible that the aforementioned MSc would be suitable for? 

My 3rd question: What other companies are recommended for renewable engineering? I mentioned the big 6 in the UK (E-ON and Scottish Southern Electric (SSE) being the most renewable focused).

My last question: Am I wasting my time and money doing this masters? E-ON, for example, requires a masters degree to apply - obviously this means doing an MSc wouldn't be a waste of time.
However, based on my 3rd question, some companies may only require a BEng, such as Scottish Power, one of the big 6.

I should mention I graduated in 2016 and have not been able to acquire a graduate role at a company. I have however done a small engineering research project for 4 months at another University. 

This 2 year gap from graduating has me worried since I will have to wait until September 2018 to even apply for these big 6 graduate schemes for a September 2019 start. If I don't get a job offer, I will be more than 3 years past graduation, making my CV look even worse. Hence doing a masters will make my CV look better, give me more job application options and increase my engineering ability.

We want to have ropes or chains running vertically from an anchor on the sea floor to a buoy on the surface, with horizontal lines running between buoys in a long chain, with another anchor at the other end. Seaweed would be grown off those ropes. We want a system that can raise and lower the ropes when there is a storm, as the storm surge could damage the growing seaweed, but only a few tens or so metres under the surface I understand the water is a lot calmer, even during storms. We would have weather sensors attached to the buoys and then as a storm is approaching it lowers the ropes to be out of harm's way. We thought we could get electric power from small solar panels on the bouy. We considered a winch in the bouy but were worried about issues with reliability and corrosion in the harsh marine environment. We also considered a pump to fill and empty a vessel to adjust the buoyancy, but again, possible issues with mechanical failure. Any ideas as to the most reliable, preferably low cost way to achieve our goal?

I am trying to find a way to make my life easier by making a special tool used for agriculture tree tarping. Plastic/tarp/netting is frequently used to cover a variety of trees and bushes to protect from weather, insects, sun, rain, etc. Here's a couple photos just for reference: https://i.imgur.com/zH7ir7V.jpg, https://i.imgur.com/3m5G1rz.jpg, https://i.imgur.com/BL0S0qa.jpg

I am covering bigger trees than I previously have in the past ( approx 15' tall, 10' wide), and have maximized the width of my plastic. Any wider, it wont fit all the other machinery I have for storing, and processing. 

Usually, the plastic overhangs the trees enough to attach clamps that anchor the plastic to the ground ( for reference: https://i.imgur.com/PFgP6uj.jpg). The problem I am currently having, is that these new trees are a fraction too large--the plastic overhangs enough for someone 6' + tall to reach to secure the clamps to the plastic, but not the layman. Since this process is already very labor-some, and the ground conditions can vary drastically, bringing a stool or ladder along isn't ideal. 

It got me thinking that it might be possible to create a simple handheld tool that could extend your reach ~3' , and attach the clamp when desired.

41,A question about hydraulic systems and liquid viscosity.,1526412649,"So today at work I had an interesting discussion. I wanted to figure out why water is not used as a hydraulic fluid. I googled around and found some answers like:

- Oil is more resistant to temperature changes

- Oil helps prevent corrosion, etc

However, my coworker told me that the use of oil instead of water is due to different 'compressibility' of these liquids.

Now, I google around once again, to find some information on this topic. The best explanation I've managed to find was this:

 ""Water has a lower viscosity than oil. Therefore, when either fluid flows though the same size orifice at the same flow rate, water will undergo a substantially lower pressure drop. This means — with all other factors equal — water can transmit power through a system more efficiently than oil can. Or water can transmit the same power as oil, but in a smaller space. This means water-hydraulic systems hold potential for higher power density than oilbased systems.""


Now, having read that, I still don't understand how is it that ""Or water can transmit the same power as oil, but in a smaller space. "". 

Anyone care to elaborate on that to a layman? And does it mean that if the only consideration was viscosity (so things like temperature and corrosion prevention and such were unimportant) then water would be a better hydraulic fluid?

42,Efficiency and NOx emission of lean burn gas engines,1526412572,"Hey folks! This might be a long shot since it is a very specific question, but I'll give it a try anyway as it is really holding up my writing process of my thesis right now.

I have a question regarding the efficiency of lean burn gas engines. Maybe it is just a confusion concerning the terminology of ""thermal efficiency"", ""brake mean pressure"", ""brake thermal efficiency"" etc. but let's see.

Stationary gas engines in combined heat and power plants are usually run at a very high air-fuel-ratio in order maximize efficiency and reduce NOx-emission at the same time. With the introduction of more air, thermal efficiency is increased due to a higher heat capacity ratio of the gas mixture. At the same time this also results in reduced temperatures in the combustion chamber which reduceds the oxidation of nitrogen and therefore lowers nitrogenoxide emissions.

However, in literature a tradeoff between low NOx-emissions and a high engine efficiency is often mentioned.

Also, I assumed that higher temperatures in a combustion chamber were indicative of an efficient combustion, which is also not in accordance with the first paragraph.

Other papers that I have read also indicate a maximum of brake thermal efficiency at the same air-fuel-ratio as the maximum NOx-emissions, which is also not in accordance with the first paragraph.

Does anyone here have a good understanding of lean burn engine mechanisms and can help me understand this? I can also provide more details regarding my own misunderstandings.

53,Why aren't superconductors being used in the production of renewable energy?,1526390236,"In any generator, the yield of energy is never 100&amp;#37; efficient due to the dissipation of energy. However, when superconductors are exposed to extremely low temperatures, have the ability to conduct electricity with zero resistance therefore will reach close to 100&amp;#37; efficiency. Wouldn't replacing copper wiring or any other common materials used as conductors for superconductors in generators lead to greater output and efficiency, whilst facilitating development of renewable energy, since  this technology could be more easily applied to generators used in the production of renewable energy? Also, couldn't this possibly lead to greater financial savings?

Some concerns regarding the use of superconductors are: 

* Lack of research and technology
* Lack of interest from people, hindering investments
* Cost of the materials and/or of the liquid nitrogen used to cool the superconductors
* Safety issues

However, according to an article linked below, some benefits of this technology in hydropower are:

* Reduced upfront capital deployment and project risk
* Minimal infrastructure investment and construction
* No grid connectivity issues
* Minimal civil engineering works and supply chain issues
* Short project time frame \(less than one year to revenue generation\)
* Minimal regulatory interaction and licence application requirements
* Highly visible, predictable, and measurable long\-term revenue generation.

It just seems too good to be true, and this technology could expand to other areas too.

61,"Career in engineering with ADHD? Is it reasonable, how are those of you doing, and are there particular jobs I should be looking for w/ an ME Degree.",1526363289,"Hi guys,

I have ADHD \(more Primary Inattentive\), and I'm certain there's more than a few employed engineers in this subreddit who also have ADHD \(and are probably on medication for it\). I'm still trying to find medication that works for me that isn't amphetamines, since I found that to be pretty miserable back before University.

So I went unmedicated for awhile. I did very well in University getting my Mechanical Engineering degree because, for the most part, I wasn't also working a job and could squish my schedule around however I needed to.

Now I'm struggling through my first real engineering job and realizing I need to get a prescription again. I'm trying to work a non\-engineering dayjob \(I need benefits\) while doing a part time engineering job which involves a lot of independent decision making \(we're prototyping\). And give up drinking. And smoking. And fix my diet. All with less personal &amp; social time than I got in University. The burnout is real, as in perpetual, and needless to say that I don't have my shit together at the professional level I need to if I want to keep my job.  Worse yet, I'm able to work on my own schedule outside my dayjob, which is a joke because the fundamental part of ADHD is I can't even manage my own life let alone a project. My first internship started to fall apart before it officially ended \(as scheduled\) for a similar reason.

I only got my degree in Mechanical Engineering because I got a scholarship. What I'm wondering is:

1\) Is it even possible to work in engineering with ADHD unmedicated?

2\) How well are you guys with ADHD doing?

3\) Are there any kinds of jobs or particular areas of work I should be shooting for? Right now I'm doing everything from CAD and CNC and FEA, to selecting equipment, process and instrumentation layouts, purchase orders, groundwork calculations to preliminary research, various submissions/reports, some 'project management' level scheduling/planning, and the obligatory code/regulation compliance research/paperwork/etc. If they could stick me with just a handful of those, or less decision making, I'd be doing much better I think.

There are certainly issues like heat dissipation and a required geartrain, but the linked motor above tops out at 4200 RPM, so not too far off your standard induction motor's 1800 RPM.",AskEngineers,,BScatterplot,/r/AskEngineers/comments/8jee6b/why_are_hobby_grade_brushless_motors_so_much/

Will staying in a relatively low paying job hinder my ability to get higher salaries later on?,1526312569,"I've been with my current company as a mechanical design engineer for 3 years now and I'm sitting at $56k in a low cost of living area. While I live very comfortably on this pay as a single guy without dependents, I cant help but fear I'm always going to be behind my peers and this low pay will follow me for years down the road. I've had recruiters ask me for my current salary and I almost always lie and tell them its 5-7k higher than what I actually make thinking I'm going to get lowballed if they know what I really make.

96,How do amps affect the charging of a car battery?,1526309900,"Hello,

So let's say I have a brushless DC motor that generates around 18 Volts and I want to charge a 16V battery.

The motor generates the voltage from the rpm the generator is spinning at, but the motor also generates amps, and where do they fit in? 

In other words: Do I have to consider how many amps are provided to the battery? Is there a minimum amount that will make the battery recharge? 

The motor I'm using is a brushless DC 24V 250W 2750 rpm motor. The rated current is at 10.9A. I assume this means the motor will provide the battery with 10.9A at 2750 rpm?
