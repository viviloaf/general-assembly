0,I'm having a difficult time with importing threads into CAD. Are there good resources out there that have CAD files of bolts/studs that actually model the ISO standard threading?,1476804279,"Typically, thread accuracy isn't a big concern since it's more or less used to represent a bolt vs. a pin.

More importantly, I would like to see a CAD file for the MAThread point, since it's somewhat complex and CAD doesn't have a built-in feature it create it.

2,Laser to measure ice thickness,1476801707,"I wonder if anybody have experience with this. 
The ice is growing on a titanium or stainless steel substrate. The way I was thinking how to measure it was to check the reflected ray intensity. The more ice there is, the greater the intensity is attenuated. So I have to select a wavelength that is sensible to the ice thickness but not too much to allow me to get a signal back at the detector. Also I guess that it should not interact too much with the titanium and steel alloy. Any idea where to start? There's a couple of ruby laser laying around at the school. I was thinking at putting water in front of my substrate and see what kind of signal I can get back... ",AskEngineers,Teechce,/r/AskEngineers/comments/584506/laser_to_measure_ice_thickness/

41,Designing for torque perpendicular to a motor shaft? (I'm not sure how to Google this),1476589873,"Howdy folks.  I'm going to try to keep this brief, so I won't go into too much detail.

**Question first**: ""What do you call a torque on a motor perpendicular to the drive shaft, and how do I know whether or not I need to account for it?""

**Context:** I'm not an engineer.  I'm intentionally outside my comfort zone here. For a personal project I'm trying to design a robot that will be primarily 3d printed.  I'm currently interested in the drive system/suspension/chassis.  I've decided to use a rocker-bogie suspension like NASA's Mars rovers (mostly because I think it's cool instead of any other criteria).  After considering the bounds of my design and using a drive motor sizing calculator, I've selected this gear motor (**https://www.pololu.com/product/2824**) to power each of my wheels. (I feel like I could probably pick a cheaper motor, but that's not actually part of this question.)  I would like to mount my wheels directly onto the shaft of that gear motor to keep the design simple.  I suspect that the motor is not designed to be loaded in this way though, and that the radial force of the wheel on the motor will damage the motor.  I think I could mount the wheel to a shaft that's secured with bearings and then couple that shaft to the motor to transfer power, but that's a lot more complexity that I'd like to avoid if I can get away with it.

**How do I know how much radial force the motor can take (while operating)?**  In a worst case scenario I expect 20N radial force at about 30mm from the end of the gearbox. (10kg maximum weight of the robot, with 5 wheels in contact with the ground.  The robot will never move above ~0.9 m/s so I'm ignoring dynamic loads.)",AskEngineers,hovissimo,/r/AskEngineers/comments/57psov/designing_for_torque_perpendicular_to_a_motor/

I also want to mount earbuds to the top corner of the device that actually play music when you select a song. I don't want an actual LCD screen interface, but I want to have 10 songs to choose from.

I was thinking I'd make 10 separate iPod screens out of cardboard, and somehow hook it up where the wheel would scroll through those different pieces of cardboard...then when one is selected it would play that song through the earbuds. 

My question is, how could I make something like this work? I was thinking I could maybe use an arduino or raspberry pi with 10 discreet resistors (with 10 separate voltages across each resistor) corresponding to 10 separate songs. I could then somehow interface a switch such that when the song is selected the switch would direct current through that resistor and the arduino would read the voltage and play the appropriate song.

Is something like that feasible? Or am I way over/under thinking it?",AskEngineers,ThatUnoriginalGuy,/r/AskEngineers/comments/57ota2/ipod_halloween_costume_questions/

  I am wondering why productions processes generally incorporate less than 20% recycled HDPE. If the plastic is clean and thermoplastics:

This characteristic allows thermoplastics to be remolded and recycled without negatively affecting the materialâs physical properties.

What's illustrated [here](http://i.imgur.com/nQElrj9.jpg) is essentially a bent threaded rod.  Obviously this compresses the thread pitch on the interior and expands the exterior, so if we just roll with it and:  
1.  Gradually remove threads toward the interior of the curve until we have a smooth surface.  
2. Add enough clearance to the nut threads that it can ride the outer threads and release threads as it approaches the inner curve.
3. Is a short enough engagement that the cylindrical nature of the nut on an arc is allowed to function.
4. Have enough flat on the nut between threads that it can ride on the smooth interior surface.
...then maybe it could work?

Obviously I realize we're loosing a lot of torque holding ability, and the adjustment may not be as smooth we'd like, but this is a a compromise solution, and really I'm just spit-balling ideas right now.  I'm here soliciting either simple alternative methods to achieve this type of adjustment, or suggestions to refine the geometry of this design to help maximize its effectiveness.

I have some pulleys (Petzl Micro Traxion, rated for 4kN safe working load &amp; 15kN breaking load) that I would like to use in a Z-rig pulling on another Z-rig (giving me a theoretical 9:1 mechanical advantage).

My questions are the following:

* What is the absolute maximum weight I can put on these pulleys (non-critical load)? The breaking load of 15kN would be 7,5kN on either side of the pulley, does this mean it could lift a weight of 1.500KG or 750KG before breaking?
* If I want to lift a weight that is too heavy for the pulleys, could I still use them higher up in the Z-Rig where there is less tension? In theory I could use carabiners for the first 2 redirects and use the pulleys in the second Z-Rig that pulls on the first, where the load weighs 1/3rd of its actual weight, right?

1. Do multiple passes, each at a different phase (use some clear acceleration event as datum) and then merge them onto a single plot

2. Same thing as (1) but using multiple IMUs on board instead of multiple passes, to reduce error but increase $$$ because i don't have that many sensors

What I've tried so far is doing it by hand, but that's almost impossible because it breaks everytime.
I tried to contact TFT manufacturers to just get the bare TFT mid-production before the rest of the layers are applied, but nobody wants to do that. (maybe someone could help me on that side?)
 
What I haven't tried is heating the panel or use chemicals to disolve what's bonding them together. Would anyone have suggestions on that aspect? I read somewhere that it's epoxied on the contour and that they use beads of glass to keep a consistent distance between the sheets in LCD displays.

89,"Salary or Hourly, I can pick which one.",1476369423,"So, I have a job offer and I can choose to either be on Salary or Hourly.  The base pay is the same either way.  Either $X per year or $X/2080 per hour.  The hourly rate pays overtime for anything over 40hrs/wk.  They say I would probably be working 40 or a little over 40 hours per week.  I have worked both hourly and salary in the past and prefer salary due to the freedom it allows.  Obviously with hourly I could make more money or less money depending on how may hours I work.  Salary would give me a guaranteed amount every month.  The company gives bonuses and raises based on personal performance and company performance.  I'm thinking that if I'm on Salary my bonus and pay increase may be higher due to the predictability of my pay vs. unknown overtime the company may need to pay for.  Does that logic make sense?

92,What's the best way design a battery powered autonomous vehicle that can go very fast and stop at a specific distance?,1476367858,"Im participating in a competition called Science Olympiad which is like track and field but with 23 science related events. One of the events I'm doing this year is called electric vehicle. The main goal of electric vehicle is get the lowest score as possible. The scoring works that it is the sum of the time of your run and the distance from the end point. The time of your run starts 0.5 meters from the starting mark and ends 8.5 meters from the starting mark, in this time frame you want to go as fast as possible. The end point which is what you want to stop exactly on will be anywhere between 9 and 12 meters. It is possible to get bonus points by arcing your run to the right between two cans shown [here](https://www.soinc.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/Electric_Vehicle_2017_Track.pdf).


The requirements are:

 -ABSOLUTELY NO REMOTE CONTROL allowed whatsoever 

 -The voltage across any two points must not exceed 9V

 -A very precise braking system to stop directly on the mark

 -the x and y axis dimensions of the vehicle must fit in a 30 by 60 cm space (z is unlimited)

 -have a dowel rod (1/4 inch) vertical on the front of the vehicle 1 cm off the ground to 20 cm above. (so the judges can use a photogate timing system.

 -Very, Very Fast

 -The vehicle needs to be started by using a pencil ""vertically"" to push a switch or some other way to start the vehicle

 -preferably be able to turn


To give you an idea of what some teams can do, the team that took second at nationals for this event last year had a time of 1.7 seconds and a distance of 2.5 cm.

It's a planetary style mixer but I don't think that's relevant.  It has three speeds already which I assume are gears as they are actuated by a large manual lever.

Unfortunately even at it's lowest setting it's still really too fast for mixing this kind of thing - it ends up crushing the dry ingredients. The lowest RPM is 98 I think.

We are looking to slow the unit down the easiest way. I understand certain kinds of electric motors are happy with reducing current and others aren't but beyond that I'm finding it really hard to get a definitive answer from anyone as to the easiest way to do this.  Obviously we could gear it down manually but that would be prohibitive due to essentially pulling it apart and engineering a whole lot of new parts.  

Ideally we could attach a dimmer of sorts and regulate the speed by modulating the power. But what kind? I know there are different ways to do that.

8,Actual low threshold for FSO accuracy?,1476315203,"Hello,

In terms of accuracy using load cells for example, [this](http://www.omega.com/pressure/pdf/LC302.pdf) family of Omega load cells states:

| Accuracy: Â±0.5% FSO linearity, hysteresis, repeatability combined

This is all fine for larger load cases (a 100lb load has up to 0.5lbs variability in reading). My concern is when we start measuring smaller loads, such as 5lbs, 1lb or even 0.5lbs, the accuracy requirement becomes much more aggressive (0.5lbs has up to 0.0025lbs variability, based ont he 0.5% FSO accuracy). 

Another example would be for current sensors. If a current sensor has ""2% accuracy"", does that accuracy extend to 10mA where there is, at maximum, 0.2mA variability?

In industry, does there exist a certain ""low"" threshold where the accuracy metric breaks down?

Background: In 3 months will be my 3rd year as an Engineer (semiconductor industry). I basically do development work that supports circuit design engineers know their non-electrical limitations in their design. I also work with vendors to bring in electrical components  and test their reliability as well as investigate failures that may pertain to said components. 

&amp;nbsp;

Situation: Thru all of this I find myself generally independent in my work and regularly contribute ideas that's outside of what I believe to be expected with someone of 3 years experience. I also maintain a system level perspective in my work and try to see the forest among the trees to understand the impact of what I'm doing. To be promoted to the next level where I personally believe I am requires 5 years of experience which I think is ridiculous. Not only that but looking among my peers who have many years experience I often feel I can keep up in terms of content and problem solving abilities. Not to say I know everything, obviously there are little tricks knowledge that can only be learned by experience. I also make mistakes and readily admit them/suggest how I would fix it.

&amp;nbsp;

In short, I am wrong to believe that I am ready to be a Senior Engineer? (In my company that means someone with 5 years experience and the above mentioned traits such as independence etc..). Is it unreasonable to think that I am limited in my growth because I don't have the 5 years experience on paper?

32,"What is the difference between ""speaker"" wire and ""electrical"" wire?",1476242861,"I've used all sorts of wire for speakers before, old/new, expensive/cheap, cut off extension cords, solid core residential wire, and even a coat hanger once.  As long as it was a sufficient gauge and a short enough length, I've never been able to hear a difference.

I've also used high end car audio cable as low volt, low amp power wire without it seeming to get hot or have any problems.  That said, the insulation seems kinda iffy to use it at mains voltage, and I don't want to burn down the house.

I've recently finished wiring a friends new car audio system, and also need to rewire a table lamp in the next day or two. So now I'm sitting here looking at a roll of 16 AWG speaker wire and a 16 AWG table lamp replacement wire, and cannot tell the difference other than the lamp wire has very obviously thicker insulation that is a different color.  When I strip the insulation, they seem to be about as flexible as each other although I do not have any scientific means of testing this at my disposal.  They are both labeled as being ""pure copper wire"" which I assume is just industrial pure, and really just some alloy to help prevent it from cracking from repeated flexing.

I tried searching Google, but all I found was a bunch of audio snobs in forums arguing over what sounds better. I'm not interested in this sounds better than that, but rather why one is the way it is or not another way.

34,Catch and release with no electronics for 3d printer project,1476229104,"My son and I built a corexy 3d printer. It has a relatively heavy inductive sensor on the xy carriage that is always attached to the carriage. This sensor is only used to probe the z height and then it's dead weight being slung around rapidly causing some vibration. We are thinking about a way to have the xy carriage slide over and pick up the z probe when needed and put it back when not needed. 
There are some designs out there where the z probe is on a sled on the x axis rails and the xy carriage moves to it and there is an eletromagnet that captures the probe.
We were thinking we could do this with something like the click release mechanism on a ball point pen. The xy carriage could maybe have a magnet on it and it would move over to the z probe sled and maybe push in the sled a little. A click would release the z probe sled. The xy would pull away with the z probe sled. Then it would put the sled back by moving back to where the z probe docks it and push it in. The xy would move away the clicker holding the z probe sled would be stronger than the magnet and it would leave the z probe sled behind. 
I can print the parts if I can get a picture of what this mechanism would look like. I think it would be some sort of a cam and a follower and maybe a spring, but hey, I'm not an engineer.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

39,"[Discussion] MechE working on a product design, first foray in to embedded systems. Should I hire an EE? Design Firm? Spend a year in the books and figure it out myself?",1476214149,"**My Scenario**: I have a well-baked idea for a small consumer electronic device. Assume for this discussion that the business-side of the concept is on relatively stable footing. I'm a mechanical engineer by trade, so the mechanical design is solid. I now need to engineer the embedded system: figure out how to build, code, and test the system for prototyping/DFM purposes. 

BTW, for context, I'm a MechE undergrad, MBA just finished up. Mechanical designer turned project management. Very confident with design for manufacturing and mechanical design, but on the EE side, I have only hobbyist experience.

**Discussion**: Being an engineer by trade, I could probably dedicate the next several months to figuring out much of the component design, but the code and system integration will push me up against my technical 'ceiling' on a reasonable time scale. I don't plan to go back to school for electrical engineering at the moment. 

* **Embedded systems, whats the learning curve like?** This device is going to need a microcontroller talking to a few sensors, SD storage, and Bluetooth. I just spent the past few days learning about embedded system design, as as many of you know, it's a wormhole. I've toyed with Arduinos before, but the next level is a big jump. I'm worried about deciding to go alone, and then getting stuck up late a night crying over a breadboard.
* **Should I try to find a technical co-founder?** I'd like to work with someone invested in the idea, and would rather own 50% of a success than 100% of a failure. But if the idea, as a business, is solid, are there better ways to outsource and retain equity/control?
* **What's a reasonable model for getting freelance/consultant help?** Design firms would probably charge me $10k to walk in the door, not to mention taking an equity stake. I could poke around my universities and look for some students looking for projects, but that's a crap-shoot. 
* **Other avenues I haven't considered?** Might some manufacturers be able to help me? What kind of capital will I need for these various scenarios? I have about $20k of personal capital to devote to this project before I need to start thinking about raising outside capital. 
* **Beyond my situation, what's some general advice for getting a technical idea from concept to market?**

**Edit:**
ok, I found this.

from this, I can assume, that each pixel has 3 lines going to it to control the color.  they use Iridium-tin Oxide and the conduits

ok, now the pixals are multiplexed. [Multiplexing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmCGDJ90Qt4)

Since we are working with OLED, instead of a stained glass as in a LCD, the pixels themselves are LED.

Now, it seems like the OLED is just a LED but instead of being made with silicon, it is made with a organic material.[OLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED)

So with all this information, I extrapolate, that first they sputter ITO onto a substrate (glass) that has a mask on it to ensure the ITO goes int he right spot, they add a few more masks to get the thin film transistors made.  all of this makes the Anode. then they add another layer with mask to make sure the OLED are in the right spot. add the OLED (a organic material that is transparent) then add the cathode.

All of it is run by a multiplexer.

One thing I cannot find anything at all on is the design of multi-axis linear cam paths - I'm pretty sure I'm using the wrong search terms or calling it by the wrong name.

Basically, [this](http://www.gostratojet.com/Marketing/Gimbal_Final_1_400px.jpg) design is the kind of design I'm trying to create. The follower of the cam arrangement travels along an arc, radius of the pivot of the joystick to the center of the follower axis. That follower rides on a levered spring-loaded arm that ideally provides symmetrical resistance leading the follower back to the center of it's arc.

I've found pictures of a [couple different 'resistance value' cam arms](https://i.imgur.com/KSCNasS.jpg) for what appears to be that design around, but no discussion of the way the paths are calculated.

The easy solution is to use two, symmetrical arms that the follower rides on, like [this design](https://i.imgur.com/GA6fPU9.jpg), or to have the cam be attached to the axis shaft like [this one](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7003/6486479749_f187209139.jpg) thereby reducing the number of moving parts. The latter, I can't do because of manufacturing considerations (Personal project, 3d printed, no way to make keyed/splined/shaped metal shafts and friction clamping won't cut it), and while I could do the former... the goal is to learn, not just finish making a thing.

I'm not sure what to set the current for the control signal as. 
The Mouser page says ""Input Current: 50 mA"", the data sheet says ""Maximum rating: Input LED forward current: 50mA"" and ""Electrical characteristics: LED operate current: 1.0 mA typical, 3.0mA Maximum; LED turn off current: 0.4 mA typical, 0.9 mA Maximum""

So the way I am taking that is I shouldn't be using 50 mA, but set it for 3 mA? So should I put a resistor on the low side for 1.1kohm?

EDIT: I think I was confused when I posted the original question. I confused RPM vs speed.

Okay. So, my experience comes from riding motorbikes. You can either have low-end grunt (torque) or you can high-speed at higher gears (horse power). So, a dirt-bike would be something that has high-torque but low HP. And a supersport bike would be the opposite of that.",AskEngineers,cupboard1,/r/AskEngineers/comments/56u5ab/what_is_it_about_combustion_engines_that_there_is/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1erMSmSHajU

I will be mainly using it for food waste and paper.

My questions are:

-Is it sensible to do it 3d printed? or can you get the main shredding parts metal for low cost (if so would be helpfull to get a link)

-I have an arduino.. I wanted to have the arduino control the motor (probably a 1hp motor not sure if that's enough , also tips on that would be helpfull). I want to have a  sensor that can know when something is stuck.. so that the motor turns the other way for a bit, declogging the machine then shredds again. Not sure what sensor to use.

-Any cool safety measures that you can add to the device so that when a person or something else comes close to the machine.. it automatically stops?

-Also the 2 shredding axels, should they run at the same speed or not? (not sure on how much torque and at what rpm the device should run too)

-what motor controller should i use to connect the arduino to that motor (since the motor will need 1 220V powersocket probably?(not sure again)).

77,submersible pump - field equipment I may/may not have broken,1476089700,"I'm hoping someone may be able to tell me if I'm at fault or not with a damaged submersible pump:

I was in the field the other day, taking water quality samples from groundwater wells. I was using a submersible pump, the well was 15m deep with standing water level at 5m below top of casing, sandy soil in this area. I put the pump into the well slowly lowering it until I hear the plop into the water and then count another 5m and stop it there. Start purging and I can see the water come through the tubing and into the water quality meter, everything is working great at this point, purging approx 10L/min . 15 minutes in I see the water retract down the tubing and back down into the well, I quickly check the pumps control box and the voltage has dropped significantly, I check the battery connection, which is fine, and then pull the pump up from the well, which is not working. I remove the control box from the battery connection and open up the pump to look inside. Fist thing I notice is that 1 of the 2 O rings is damaged and coming off, melting plastic smell and see that some of the plastic components have melted over the internal power connection parts. I also notice there is a few little droplets of water inside the pump, but I cannot be sure that they get in there as a result of me opening the pump or water had leaked in.

The equipment hire mob are saying I ran the pump dry and it over heated, but I'm sure it would of been underwater the whole time, it is a large well (80mm dia) 15m deep in sandy soil, I have sampled this bore 5 times previously with no problems (however using a different pump) and - 
my main question is, if the well was dry would the water that is already in the tubing be pumped to the surface or flow back down into the well. 

I think I have answered my own question, the weight of the water in the tube would fall back into the well, as the pump would not be able to push the water through the tubing using only the air available in a dry pump before it over heated.

Just smooth concrete sides so you can ""pig"" it like you say. Also drain it for maintenance, it would be at sea level but there would be a way to pump it out.
Then you can have high velocity as well.

My dad is a big baseball fan, and I'm an engineering student. We're looking at this, and he thinks that the bat must have had a crack in it for it to snap like that. 

My thought is that it seems like it snaps exactly where you would expect, given a ""legit"" situation. It snaps right above his hands, where you would think the torque exerted would create the greatest stress against the inertia of the bat. Additionally, it seems like this spot wouldn't develop any cracks in the wood. I also don't think there would be a knot in the wood - they seem pretty tight on the quality control. Additionally, the grain in a bat runs the length of the bat, meaning it's less likely for a crack to develop right above the handle.

I worked on drafting things from time to time, at the direction of ""Bob"".  Bob works in Illinois, I work in Wisconsin - project is in Wiscinsin and I am the only Wisconsin PE.  Basically, I discovered a serious design flaw which was ""addressed"" though not to my satisfaction as the new design has serious flaws of its own.  Not I am being forced to stamp the plans anyway because the company owner doesn't want to because he ""is not familiar"".

Here is my letter of refusal... thoughts?



I cannot in good faith stamp these plans. It violates the ethics set forth by the National Society of Professional Engineers.

NPSE Code of Ethics II.2.b ""Engineers shall not affix their signatures to any plans or documents dealing with subject matter in which they lack competence, nor to any plan or document not prepared under their direction and control.""

Primarily, I do not have confidence in this design or any design set forth at this point.Â  It is clear that Bob was going to try to push through the old design, which was inadequate and had major flaws, wash his hands of it and be done with it.Â  How, now, should I take his word for it- even if he (finally) answers any of my questions?Â  Bob is your employee and if you have confidence in him and his work then it should be no problem for you to but your name and seal on his work.Â  He can explain to you the same things he would explain to me and that should be sufficient.Â  This project has not prepared under my direction or my control, as I did not direct Bob.

Secondarily, I do not have the familiarity to sign off on sedimentation basin design, detention basin design or the details. Again, I would have to take Bob's word for it.Â  I would be happy to learn about it on my own or through training but that cannot happen in time for this project to be sealed in a timely manner.Â  There are many details of the project which I have never encountered before.Â  While yes, I am currently a ""civil engineer"", my previous project experience was all transportation and as such this is my first real site civil project.Â  (Creative Campus I did grading and layout for, but no details- also I was part of a team, not soleyresponsible).Â  Yes, there is a first time for everything but that first time through is generally not when one would stamp and seal a plan set without full competence and familiarity.

Lastly, my primary role on this project has been drafting - while I have been doing so with a critical eye, too many errors were left on the plan and got through too many ""reviews"" for far to long for me to trust their corrections.Â  The pkan was ""substantially complete"" when I was hired and I was the one to find these errors?

So, for those reasons I cannot seal this plan set as I cannot accept personal, legal and professional responsibility.Â  Bob is your employee and under your direction and control - he can explain the plan, design and methods to you.",AskEngineers,OutsideCreativ,/r/AskEngineers/comments/56l0sr/asked_to_stamp_someone_elses_shitty_plans_my/

4,Thinking of changing engineering career path - Advice,1475966928,"Hi, this is my first post in this community. I am a graduate engineer and I've been working at my company for just over a year. We design and manufacture industrial equipment for power plants mainly (which is a dying industry as it is). The graduate programme lets you do 10 week placements in different departments so you can get a good overview of the company and at the end of 2 years decide where you want to work permanently. So far there is one department which I think I'd like to work in because their work is a mix of R&amp;D and also troubleshooting for clients - if something isn't working they're the go-to to find the cause and solution etc. However, the department is small and I don't think it's likely they will have a vacancy by the time I finish on the programme. In other departments the type of engineering they do is fairly boring to me. I thought design engineering would be fun, however what we do is basically follow a design manual and most of the calculations are automated by spreadsheets. That is expected since it's unproductive to work things out by hand, however I feel there's very little creativity or thinking involved most of the time.

7,What is the most effective method(budgetwise) to produce Bioethanol from Biomass ?,1475948205,"The main idea is to commercialize E10 gasoline to the government with reasonable price compared to the gasoline my country have right now ($0.6 for 92 RON and $0.7 for 95 RON)  
  
There are many ways to create bioethanol from biomass, such as breaking down lignocellulose materials into sugar by enzymatic and acidic treatment, syngas fermentation, syngas catalytic converter, and so on.  
There are so much variety of biomass to use from, for example corn ethanol (US) and sugarcane ethanol (Brazil)  
  
The main problem is how we can create bioethanol with the least amount of money involved but still effective to do so. Pretreatment upon lignocellulose into sugar and then convert it into bioethanol is expensive.  
Effective here means it can be commercialized and built upon a pilot plant or even there's any company who already done that.  
  
Surely the government is willing to subsidy (maybe only a bit) regarding this idea.   
My country produces palm oil quite a lot so investors are more interested about this. Biodiesel is already implemented here.  
  
I've tried to look upon a few things, but what I got is a laboratory scale experiment reports which isn't good enough to be used in pilot plant.

17,Piezo Orientation for Doppler Flow Measurement,1475880429,"Hi all,

I'm working to design a dual-element piezo sensor for flow measurement inside a pipe. There seems to be plenty of material online about Transit time (TOF) ultrasonic flowmeters, but not a lot about Doppler, so I have a couple questions.

1. Is there a requirement for transducer angles? It looks like all of the transit time flowmeters are at 45 degrees. My concern with having two 45 degree transducers next to eachother is that it will be impossible to understand where in the velocity profile the reflections are coming from. So, perhaps it's better to focus the transducers on a point maybe 0.5"" from the pipe wall? Or integrate TOF pulses with Doppler to know where in the pipe they are?

2.The wedge geometry between the piezo element face and the face of the pipe should be acoustically conductive. Are there particular materials that are good for this? I've just started experimenting with 3D printed plastics, but they seem to dampen the signal significantly. I see polyimide or acrylic used in several places; why not metal?

3. Is there a particular frequency that works well here? This is a mostly fluid application; so I'm thinking around 1MHz would work well, but I see ranges from 500kHz to 2MHz.

Thanks for the advice!!

20,Doing A project Need help! (Automated Compost Machine),1475874774,"Hey guys

So i'm thinking of doing An automated compost Machine (For people Who doesn't know what it is... it's basically a machine that turns your food waste into a kind of fertilizer).

What i was thinking of doing is First Have the Food introduced into a shredder.. then it goes into a storage bin where it gets composted..

This bin will have a shaft in the middle with paddles on it (motorized ofc) that will turn the compost mix once in a while.

This storage bin will be heated since the perfect temperature for a compost is 60 Celcuis... The temperature will be monitored by some sort of temperature sensor (connected to an arduino?).
We will monitor the Temperature so that if the Temperature goes higher than 60.. the compost will be mixed (with the paddles mentioned above, and the rpm of the fans that intake the air inside the bin will go higher,,, untill the temperature goes below 60.

I'm also thinking on making a water collection device: Meaning that the mixture should have a certain % of humidity in it... by using a humidity sensor(?) it will monitor if it ever goes higher than it should do.. If it does.... a fan that will draw the vapour inside the bin will be activated the vapour will go into a condeser then will be removed from the system.



My questions for this project are:


1- What kind of Temperature sensor i could put in the system (in the middle of the compost since that is where the highest temperature will be) and that can withstand the mixing process. + i guess there will be cables going from the sensor outside of the compost bin to the micro controller. So my question is how is the best way to manage that.


2-: Same as question 1 but for the moisture sensor


3-: i want to heat the bin inside the machine on the bottom..(what kind of material(copper for conductivity?, but then how to shield that copper from the food waste mix)and what kind of electrical heating element should i use)



4-For the water condenser.. i was thinking of a fan that will draw the vapour in then it will go through a metallic fin that will condense the water... on the bottom side of the fin there will be an exhaust fan so that the heat can escape from the fins... Any better method?

27,How is annealing prevented in full automatic firearms?,1475856558,"The peak chamber pressure is often around 400MPa. With Lame function and relatively thick barrel you get about 1,5 times higher hoop stress at the inner surface. Now we are at 600MPa. I picked somewhere that the proof pressure for a barrel is ~3 times the working pressure. Which makes sense, as with steel you then have good chance to stay under fatigue limit. Now we are at 1800MPa.

The steel grade for full auto weapons is typically 4140.  (It seems to be very consistent here.) But you need very specific heat treatment to get even close to 1800MPa.

Typically 5.56 gets about 1600J energy from barrel. It has about 33% efficiency and shoots about 10 rounds/second. The heating power is ~50kW. Lets assume that half of that is expelled with cartridge cases and escaping gasses. Then we still have enough heat to fry bacon.

How do you protect the fragile inner surface of the barrel from too much heat?

I've noticed that 4140 has very good heat conductivity given it's high yield strength. Maybe that's related?

On full load, said structural component (which joints the wheel to the rest of the frame basically, and it connects to the frame through a bearing joint so it can pivot) will deform elastically. Because it will deform, it acts as a spring and I believe it is important to include it on the suspension model. The deflection won't be huge, for sure.

The major is still technically in our school's engineering department and you graduate with a BS. You pretty much learn web design, basic coding, and principles of design. I understand that it isn't really an engineering degree, which is my concern.

I want to change majors because I only chose ArchE for design purposes. I got to design a house in a class last year, loved it, and changed my major. Now I'm beginning to realize ArchE is mostly HVAC and mechanical systems etc, nothing really design related. I could go on and get a masters in architecture and become an architect, but then I feel like my undergrad wasn't really necessary in the first place. I'm not struggling in any of my classes, I'm actually doing very well, I just have absolutely no interest in them and no motivation to do the work.

I'm thinking about TAM because I have loved coding since high school, and there are quite a few computer science courses required for the major. I also love design and aesthetics, and am a musician. I spend pretty much all my free time making music and have close connections in the music industry. The degree offers a sound route, where I could more thoroughly study music software and learn music production. I also have a lot of music connections in LA and NYC where I could possibly reach out to and design web pages for labels or produce for musicians etc after I graduate.

I still am very worried about being able to find jobs with this major. I would like advice on whether or not any of y'all think that it would be possible at all to get a job after college studying TAM or if ArchE is the more secure route.

51,Will the byproducts of peroxide decomposition corrode a 316-SS / Cu system?,1475769315,"I have 90% hydrogen peroxide undergoing catalyzed (Pt) decomposition in a chamber made of 316 stainless steel.  The peroxide is forced into the chamber at ~200 psi, and temperatures commonly exceed 800 F.  The stainless steel has been passivated with sulfuric acid and dilute peroxide.  To counteract leaks around the chamber's seal, it's been suggested that I add a copper gasket.  
  
I know that copper and 316-SS will undergo galvanic corrosion in a conducting medium, that superheated steam is generally quite corrosive, and that the presence of lots of oxygen (due to the peroxide decomposition) also contributes to corrosion.  It's not clear, however, if steam constitutes a sufficiently conductive medium to cause galvanic corrosion.  I'm also uncertain if the combination of high pressure, temperature, oxygen, steam, and dissimilar metals will create a perfect storm of sorts.  Can anyone help?  
  
Thanks!
  
edit:  Replacing the copper gasket frequently is not a problem, if it comes to that.  If the steel is corroding, though, that's a major problem.

1. Buy an SMA -&gt; USB adapter and connect to the Pi's USB ports (not sure if this is actually possible)

My boss wanted to know if the footings would need to change (such as a plate on the base of each post that is bolted to the concrete floor vs setting the supports in the cement and filling over), but they told us to ask his engineers (me, new hire, ME). Is this something that would easily mount to cement (the slab for the building is at least 6 feet deep, 40k sq ft warehouse that already has various cranes and milling equipment), or is this something we would need to get outside help to contract the engineering design-work for the bases? We should have the capabilities to install ourselves.

I am assuming that the vertical supports will come with some sort of base mount, of which we can drill holes and set anchors. What I need to know is if I am overthinking this and there should be no issue, or if I need to get outside contracting for this. What we are getting is not finalized yet as it depends on installation costs.

50 ft wide, with 20-25 ft spacing between supports

I would guess each support base would need to support 15 tons, taking into account the 10 ton max load and the weight of the crane itself, with a small safety factor. How can I tell if this is too much weight for cement to support, if given the surface area of the base plate?

I have a friend I am helping, who needs to know salary expectations for a position he is currently interviewing for.

The job title is roughly ""Mechanical Project Engineer"" who will be taking ownership of projects in brake development and production for one of the biggest truck companies. His responsibilities or activities would involve:

 * Mechanical design of components of a braking systems
 * Test and development of the system
 * Dealing with suppliers and stakeholders of the project
 * Supporting assembly line engineers and technicians

He has a PhD from a good University, and has roughly 1-2 years post graduate experience in very relevant projects to braking. The position is in Europe.

This is what I want to duplicate, but I have some complications:  I'm using SMT components (although if necessary I could probably used leaded).  I have a 3w bi-color cree type ""bat wing"" LED (it has 4 legs).  (also, is there a better more standardized term to describe [this](http://image2.buyincoins.com/bicv2/product/s0/3w-led-lamp-beads-pure-white.jpg) form factor?  It seems quite popular).  [Here is a simple illustration I made](http://i.imgur.com/hZgD1tC.jpg) to show the Coast G20 layout.  
Finally, while all the above are standalone questions, the particular LED I'm working with right now is rather fancy (besides the bi-colorness)  it has a soft silicone lens and I feel like I might get better results using a [TIR reflector](http://www.optic-fov.com/en/news/211.html) rather than conventional or flat/convex.  It seems to me that that would capture and reflect more of the otherwise lost light.  I wonder how much efficiency we're losing in the coast example.  The fact that TIR's typically reach down and surround the dome seems particularly effective at capturing that stray light and surrounding the diode element.  Yes?
This might be even better when using a silicone lens as it would perfectly conform.   At least that's my thinking.

Oh, and since it's got two chips side by side, I think it's going to be harder to get a blended and uniform spot since light will be coming from one side or the other even though the lens is surrounded (at least in the TIR example).  I wonder if native TIR design also might help with that.

From my research, it seems like situations where hydraulic oil travels across a pressure differential (orifice, relief valve, leak, etc.) without doing any work, there is a temperature rise. My understanding is this is an isenthalpic process and since the volume of the oil is not changing but its pressure is, this change is ""made up for"" by an increase in temperature. 

The Joule-Thompson effect in regards to expanding gases makes sense to me. That physical explanation makes sense. Its when the working fluid is a liquid is what I find confusing. Compress a gas, molecules get closer, start smashing into each other more, and you get a temperature increase. Reverse it for an expanding gas. But what about an in-compressible liquid?

15,Need Advice: Assembly Line to Engineering,1475594534,"I am a new graduate with a B.Eng in Automotive Engineering, but I have had no previous engineering experience. I recently applied to a major car company for an engineering position. They called me back to interview me for an assembly line position. This position is a 6 month contract. It is a 48 hour work week with hourly pay, and shift work including Saturdays. The pay increases for afternoon and midnight shifts, and the job also includes benefits.

The hiring process contains 3 interviews, the final interview being a physical component. The first interview went really well, and I just received a call to be interviewed a second time. It is my dream to work at this company in the long term, however, as an engineer. They told me that after 90 days of work, I will have access to internal postings, and that the company prides themselves on employee retention.

TLDR; (My Question): If I get offered a job as an assembly line worker, do you think this is a good way to get into this big company, and work my way up towards being an engineer? Or, will I be stuck working on the assembly line since I am not using my time towards getting any engineering experience?

Thanks!

EDIT: Had another interview for this position, where HR sat me down and said, you're a graduated engineer, you bring to the table more than most people we interview for this, and he told me, without sugar coating it, what the job will be like. It is a labor job, and right now they need people to put together cars.
When I asked about moving up in the company he said there was one recent example, an engineer, who worked on the line for 5 months and once an internal engineering posting was available, he ended up applying for it and got the job. This candidate though, apart from the regular work said, ""Hey, I'm an engineer, is there anything else I can do."" He participated in extra activities and using that experience got the job as an engineer. He also told me, the way it works at this company is that they bring on engineering students to do internships, prepare them, and once they go back to school and graduate, hire them again. This cycle is usually maintained and external applicants are somewhat rare. So even though he can't promise me that I will move up, it is a possibility.

There's an opening for an entry-level electrical design engineer at a nuclear power plant that caught my eye and I definitely qualify for it. I find design interesting but I think ultimately I'd like to head down the project management path rather than the nitty gritty technical path.

Now, I think that this could really be a cool experience but am concerned over the working conditions in such an environment.

* How frustrating is it to work with, what I'm assuming to be, a massive amount of ""red tape""?

32,Traffic engineers: question about peak hour and AADT for a local road,1475535060,"Hello!

An engineering study counted cars (manually) on my little street, which is currently zoned as a local street. They recorded 2 hours worth of traffic in 15 minute increments. They say that 230 cars drove on the street during that time. The main engineer started that it is common to view a two hour rush period as 10% of the daily traffic, thus making my street hold 2300 daily traffic. This is happening in Florida.

Questions I have:
1. Is it common to estimate the AADT from a two hour Peak Hour Traffic sample on a local street? (The only policy I can find relates to highways)

If so, can anyone point me to an official document clarifying this rule?

2. Both Florida and DOT documents state that even sort term traffic counts should be performed by counting devises. Is it unheard of to have a person go out and count cars by hand?

3. Any other best practices I should know of? I have been reading about traffic studies for the last 30 days and feel that I know a very limited amount of knowledge about this subject.

My advisor told me I'm the kind of student that ""only used to come around every few years"" - a mechanical engineer with an interest in electronic stuff and actually *liked* the MatLab course so much he went ahead and learned Python. I'm a big fan of the more analytical, cutting edge, rapid prototyping kind of design engineering. I'm not incredibly keen on the manufacturing side of things, although I do understand that a lot of times that's the first step towards design work.

for an example of the kinds of jobs I've been excited about, I was considered (and declined) for a new product development engineer position at Vitamix, and I'm currently pursing a position at a packaging automation company in my home town (although that's a long shot, they want someone with more experience). 

I've applied to a bunch of heavy industrial positions, and had some interviews with them, but all of them seem to see right through me during interviews - they see that it isn't really my cup of tea based on my experience and skill set. the jobs that really interest me are few and far between. it also doesn't help that I'm really trying to stay local (NE Ohio), because we recently had a death in the family and I don't want to move hours away from everyone at this time.

are there any industries I should look into, or any keywords I should search that maybe I haven't thought of yet? I feel like I have to be the ideal candidate for someone, but I have no idea who they might be. or maybe there's something I'm missing entirely here and you guys can set me straight.

41,"Is ""I like science and don't like much else"" a good enough reason to switch careers?",1475517813,"Hi. I graduated last year with a degree in math and found a job in an investment consulting firm. I am good at my job, but it is not very interesting. I get that most entry level jobs won't be the most exciting thing out there but the most frustrating thing is that I can't get myself to commit myself to this field because of how dull I find it to be. I'd like to be able to find a profession where I can show some kind of interest.

I don't think I will be pursuing more math as I always felt out of depth as a math major. I'd get through the first 3 questions in a problem set, struggle through the next 3, and then the last 4 I would be completely lost.

I was also terrible at computer science. For some reason, CS conceptually made sense. Input these things and receive this output. I'd write the code and I'd be debugging into the morning a project was due.

Natural sciences was my main interest in high school. Physics and chemistry was very fun. Biology was conceptually interesting but memorizing everything was a pain in the ass. Would I rather memorize the Krebs cycle or some accounting terms? Krebs cycle all day long. The only reason I didn't get into engineering was because I gave up on my dreams too easily. I got crushed by an intro chem lab in college and went with math--the closest thing without labs.

My quandary is whether I should leave my current field and pursue something very different. My plan would be keep my current job, since it doesn't take more than 40 hours out of a week, and then take evening classes at a local CC for basic science classes and do an online engineering degree at ASU. I can take up to 1st year physics, chem, bio, and organic chemistry at a local CC. If I can get through those classes and keep my desire to enter engineering, then I'd seriously consider applying to school. I'm not yet decided whether a second bachelor or a master's in engineering would be a better idea. Some say that a BS is required to become licensed whereas some dispute that claim.

Anyway, my main question is whether I should switch into engineering just because I think I would find the area of study more interesting than what I currently do (finance).

47,"Fixed Friction Joint for Lamp Arm(no outer springs, no outer adjustment screw)",1475496258,"Hi! I originally posted this question in /r/engineering but i was told i might have a better chance at getting an answer here.


I am working on a lamp for hospitals that is build almost entirely in aluminium and has two main joints(60mm x 50mm) and one smaller upper joint. It's the two 60mm x 50mm joints that currently does not work. http://imgur.com/O0tSIyF http://imgur.com/hRr1iGZ

Since the lamp is to be used in hospitals it can have no open surfaces or steep angles since it needs to be extremely easy to clean. It can have no outer mechanics(springs etc) for the same reason.

It is a bedside lamp that needs to be usable for patients with poor motor skills. Therefore it needs to be usable with one hand or even better one finger.

The reason for aluminium is that lamps made of plastic come off as cheap and are pretty hard to sell. Furthermore the main LED's produces a fair amount of heat which needs to be led away.

The lamp head weighs about 400 grams so the middle joint needs to carry around 4-500 grams and the lower joint needs to carry around 8-900 grams.
Now my problem is to make a joint within 50mm x 60mm that holds the weight of the lamp but at the same time can be moved with one hand(if a sick patient, a very weak hand).
Does there currently exist a standard friction joint that can solve this? I have tried the following:

* Torsion spring: Reverts to same position every time. http://imgur.com/fb9ErG3 

* Aluminium on aluminium friction: Changes over time. 

* Rubber washer: Wears down, changes friction. http://imgur.com/hRr1iGZ 

* Plastic washer: Wears down, changes friction. 

* Belleville Spring: Lamp sags 10-20 centimeters when repositioned. http://imgur.com/WnWconF 

* Wave Spring: Lamp sags 10-20 centimeters when repositioned. http://imgur.com/bFLYXBV 

* Wave Spring Washer: Lamp sags 10-20 centimeters when repositioned. http://imgur.com/Mi13Wh3


I tried a lamp that had smooth movements when repositioned. Inside the joint it seemed like there was just a steel cylinder with two steel hooks wrapping/catching around it, creating the friction. I have not figure out how that worked. Might be hooks were made of springy type steel, might be very exact milling that created the exact right friction.
I don't have a CNC machine at hand but i can order new designs with around 2 weeks delivery time.


I don't have software that can simulate mechanics or friction so i can't model the scenario.
What i am basically asking for is help with a solution to this problem or knowledge that can lead me to one. Ideally i just want a product, that have the exact characteristics i have described.

This is probably going to cover several more focused topics that I have attempted to research as a hobbyist off and on for quite some time, but just never found what I was looking for. I'm hoping for some direction, additional sources... or perhaps just clarification on what key things I should be researching. 

I am an Electronics Technician by profession, but my job can be as vague as ""Here, we have this possibly one of a kind electromechanical device with no documentation. It needs fixed."" So my job can get a little ""mixed-subject."" I find myself stepping out of my educational boundaries occasionally when I have to repair, or perhaps even fabricate mechanical parts. Hopefully through this experience, I can broaden my abilities and transition away from just a ""working knowledge"" on some of these things.

Now, an example of a current (for funsies) project of mine so that we can discuss the issues at hand. I'm in the process of integrating a carputer into the dash of my car. This is going in along with new custom molded fiberglass kick panels, subwoofers mounted between the cab and trunk space, tactile transducers in the seats, EL wire in the trim... etc. Hey, why not have fun while we learn, right?

Here's the issues: Almost nothing in terms body component dimensions are documented and provided to the public for cars. Many of these things can be derived by simple measurements... some of these can't. Mount points are easy, but conforming to other aesthetic pieces is mind boggling to me.
My dash for instance, is an amalgamation of free-form curves, with an inset for the stereo and AC controls that I just cannot seem to derive and reconstruct in Solidworks.

In the past I have played with 3D scanning using structured light, or more recently using a Kinect V2 for depth mapping... but neither of these (at least in the capacity that I used them) yielded accurate enough results to derive meaningful parameters or meshes.

I've had ideas on how to use a Kinect V1 in conjunction to give me additional data by using structured light and perhaps even photogrammetry and am currently pursuing that as that has the most in common with my current skill-set (electronics, programming).

I guess to sum everything up... What are some good reverse engineering practices or techniques that could be applied here, or for my job?

I'm not sure how I secure the rear wheels to the chassis though, I have a cylindrical metal rod that attaches to the wheel but I need some way to attach the rod to the chassis that allows it to spin freely but remain attached to the robot.

69,"Is there energy loss in this magnetic information transfer system? If so, how would one go about quantifying it?",1475417689,"Here is my idea: On a table, there are 5 vertical pins (nails or bolts) arranged in an evenly spaced line. Take 5 bar magnets and drill holes in the middle, and place on the pins. Each bar magnet can spin freely, but each end is within proximity of the radius of the adjacent magnet.

Holding the first magnet in line, point its magnetic north towards the adjacent magnet. I would expect all magnets to align. Now, flip the first magnet. I expect each magnet to reverse its direction, down the line, similar to a line of dominos. Using this technique, a binary stream can be sent from one end to the other.

How far can I make this line of magnets before I would be unable to transmit a clear binary value? Intuitively, what are the sources of energy loss that would prevent the line of magnets from stabilizing to a clear ""1"" or ""0""?",AskEngineers,panlex_2010,/r/AskEngineers/comments/55idhj/is_there_energy_loss_in_this_magnetic_information/

71,What do I need (or need to consider) in order to hang sports netting in a gym between its two concrete block walls?,1475409378,"Obviously a non-engineer here.  We contract to run volleyball leagues in a gym that is set up for basketball.  They just installed a super fancy gym divider system that lowers from the ceiling, spans the width of the gym, is solid (not a curtain that is two pieces meeting in the middle to close), and separates the 2 basketball courts just fine.   However, our volleyball nets are a 3 post system which runs perpendicular to that.     So we can lower their new divider netting, but only to the top of our nets (because of the center post).  We need to add some additional - and removable - netting underneath that so we have full coverage/separation between our two courts.  They're willing to consider letting us attach something to the concrete side walls but we can't attach anything to that new existing netting (i.e. hang something from it).  

So far we're imagining running wire cable across the space width-wise (approx 70') and maybe attaching it with a turnbuckle (?) type thing on the ends.  We can buy sports netting that comes with grommet tape around the outside so the cable could just thread through that.   But we know nothing about the strength requirements for the cable or considerations for the anchor points in the concrete wall, or what kind of connectors we could use to make it removable etc.  

We didn't know they were making this gym modification and our leagues just started and our players are rightfully annoyed.  (games are continually disrupted from the ball in the other court)

I've an engineering background myself, so hopefully obvious debugging done already, would love some suggestions of what I'm missing!

OK - I have 2 cellphones, the UK versions of both the LG G4 and CAT S60.  I have 2 SIMs on the same network (Three in the UK).  Both SIMs work just fine in the G4, only one of the SIMs will work in the CAT S60 (in either SIM slot, tried all the usual reboots, trying it as the only SIM, both SIMs together, etc - the one that works works consistently, the one that doesn't consistently doesn't).  I think I can say both phones work fine.  And either SIM works perfectly in the G4.  But only one in the S60.

Three's UK network has no 2G - so it's all 3G/HSPA/LTE if that makes any difference.  It means no calls or data possible on the SIM on that other handset.  All testing in a strong signal area, and as I say, one SIM from the network is happy as Larry (if it makes any difference, it's on PAYG), one not (if it makes any difference, it's on a 1 month rolling SIM-only, with unlimited data, and on the G4 I regularly clock up 7-12GB/month on it).

As the staff at the Three shop seem to be challenged by technical questions, I'd love the thoughts of anyone who is actually au fait with the little bit of the equation between the SIM slots and the telcos as to if there are any obvious things I should try - for instance any bits of software/debug modes that would give useful info about bands/channels etc?

In trying to calculate the amount of material that can be taken off before the hoop stresses become too large.

So while stationary an existing radial pressure exists on the inner diameter of a thick walled cylinder, resulting in hoop stress. When the shaft and cylinder start to rotate, the radial pressure from the interference fit is reduced as the cylinder inner diameter increases due CF forces. 

However using a reduced radial pressure in lames thick walled cylinder equations(adjusted to account for rotation)results in a smaller hoop stress which I'm sure is not the case as the tension in the hoop is getting ever larger as the cylinder expands?

Couple related questions, is it bad practice to have an idle shaft and sprockets with bushings but neither keys nor set screws, and also have the shaft mounted in bearings (IE the shaft is free to rotate in the mount, and the sprockets are also free to rotate on shaft)?

First of all what is a Bio Signal Device? I searched the net and there is no doubt a Bio Signal Device used in Medical Science, but how come a Ring for Water has become Bio Signal. According to the promoters, they could not explain me how this device worked, but confirmed that it changes the Molecules of Water by some wave stored in this device. There is no way to check if the device is working or not and they did not have any testing methods, but their word that this device works. According to them the information is a Proprietary of the Inventor, but found that there is another Company called Merus which is in the same field. If this is a reality, then how come 2 companies having Proprietary information have not filed for a Patent? The life of this Stored energy on a small ring is 15 years, but it could not be confirmed by any means only by some special Photography, which is not available to normal people.

My biggest issue right now is I am not sure what components actually go together, and fear that I may be redundant or missing something. Because the system is hypothetical I was going to try and shoot for the highest efficiency while still balancing first costs. 

**My initial thoughts for a system would be:**

* A main AHU supporting VAVs

* ~~Dual-duct VAV units to increase efficiency~~ Looks like this is out 

* A boiler for ""wet"" heat

* A chiller system for the AC

* A heat recovery wheel in the AHU for efficiency

* ~~Possibly fill in with Fan Coils and Chilled Beams where necessary~~ Most likely will need something to handle perimeter loads instead

* Would love to include renewable energy, mainly geothermal (the roof of this structure wouldn't be good for PV panels)


&amp;nbsp;


And that's about it. I'm not sure if my ""system"" is complete or even possible with my little knowledge. 


&amp;nbsp;



**Things I have been having a hard time finding info on are:**

* How to condition the large open garage area (large doors opening/closing, fumes, etc)

* What special requirements are needed for the gym/locker rooms/showers as I know humidity and air quality are concerns here

* Special requirements for the kitchen (besides an exhaust fan)



&amp;nbsp;



Any comments/insight on how to select a system would be great! I want to make sure I am prepared for this meeting and am using my resources!


&amp;nbsp;



Thanks in advance.


&amp;nbsp;


**Edit:** I should also mention the climate. This is in eastern Washington, so it gets pretty cold in the winter, and pretty hot in the summer. I'd say an average winter day could be 20 F, and summer being 90-95 F. It doesn't seem to be very humid either. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Edit 2:** The building is a total of 15,000 square feet! I should also mention the roof of this building is pretty interesting, there are separate roof sections and they are all sloping and look something like a parabolic curve at the cross section. There is one flat spot and it is on top of an ""observation tower"" -- would this reduce the likelihood of rooftop units?

6,Maximum loading of M5 bolt,1475247469,"I needed some bolts quickly for a longboard.  The only ones I could get hold of were A4 Stainless Steel m5.  They are not marked regarding whether they are m5-50/70/80.  So I am being safe and assuming they are A4-50.

Which means they have a tensile strength of 500MPa and a 0.2% Proof of 210MPa.  I found that the stress area is 14.2mm^2, so then the max force at yield is 2982N which is around 300KG ish.

This seems high for a stainless m5 bolt, but the numbers seem correct.  So I guess, the question is, am I correct?

Second Part: Since there are 8 that carry the load, myself and the deck weigh around 100kg.  Therefore each bolt is only carrying around 13kg of the load?

I'm researching for a feature on this, and would really like some help regarding the potential specifications. I want it to be more of a fun, than serious piece.

Reports from the Guardian newspaper say this wall will allegedly be concrete and rebar as high as 17m along the nearly 2000 mile border between the US and Mexico. Do you reckon that could be the case? How much cement could be used, what kind, where would the resources come from?

How difficult would you think it would be to build and maintain this 'Mexico wall' practically, in a real post-election America, if Trump wins? AKA strengthening the border, not just building a wall so high, so deep and so long etcetera, but what kind of surveillance and technology would have to be employed?

And how much could the entire thing cost?

&amp;nbsp; I know it's not going to be perfect, but I'd like to get as much air flow as I can without having the fans fight each other or wasting effort blowing sideways or some other oddity I may not know about when it comes to multipler blowers in parallel.  I have already found out the hard way that mismatched blowers or too high a static pressure will have air coming out the inlet, and that these types of blowers put air out at an angle when the outlet is unrestricted.  

&amp;nbsp; Do you have any advice to help me do this better? Is there any sort of online resource, textbook, set of guidelines or other rules of thumb covering a situation like this?  The easiest thing to do would be to put the outlet of each blower flat on the face of the heatsink, but that seems like it's too easy to be the correct answer. I can make up basic baffles, ducts and manifolds but I'd like to keep this as compact as practicable.  

&amp;nbsp; There is going to be a second pile of blowers on the other side, so it's a series-parallel configuration, but I think I can manage the inlets. Still feel free to chime in with some inlet-specific advice if you feel like it!   

...after reading the rules:

* It's strictly a personal project, a peltier dehumidifier, for amusement purposes. I've got the concept working but now I'm wanting to make it better.  Better means not ear-splitting noise like when using the larger blowers i have available

* Budget is $0, all the parts have come along as scrap, and I'm pretty sure these are the parts I want to use

* If I could get this to work as well as it has with the loud fans, but with these smaller, quieter blowers, that's the target. This will probably include sound reducing baffles and/or an enclosure in the future. If it were quiet enough to not mind it running all the time at work or at home, that would be spiffy, but it's not necessarily something that I'm gonna end up using.",AskEngineers,iamonlyoneman,/r/AskEngineers/comments/554c7t/can_you_provide_information_regarding_using/

I see two options, having a single spiral spring that has a combination of turns, thickness and width that allows for the maximum power density within the bounding box.

The second would be having a circular array of spiral springs that all hook onto the arbor in the center.

The motivation is that the current method is expensive. He wants to know why taking the technology from, say, automobiles wouldn't be a cheap, viable solution (since they are mass produced, they have a lower cost). Is it because they aren't intrinsically safe?

I leave one battery bank attached to the solar panel throughout the day and I take the other one with me to charge devices. Once that one is used up, I switch the roles of the two battery banks. My only problem is that the single 20 watt portable panel doesn't quite get the 20000mah battery bank fully charged by the time I need it. 

Is there a simple way to link two portable panels together to charge a single power bank, or am I making this more complicated than it needs to be? I like how compact these panels are, but the one does just sit at the campsite all day charging while I run around hiking. 

Actually as I'm writing this out, maybe the trick is to get a panel for each battery. One that sits at the site and one that moves with me trickle charging the battery that's in use. Making the travel one last longer and givin the campsite one more time to sit and charge before I need it.

I need to create a solid body representing the epoxy filled into the gaps of an assembly. Right now, my only working theory is to create a solid block of material larger than the assembly, and use Boolean Remove with a copy of each other body in the assembly to chisel out a body defined by the previous empty space. However, I know it will become difficult to chisel away the material that is larger than the solid block, and also that using copies of the assembly bodies will mean that any further changes to those bodies will not automatically update the ""Epoxy"" body.

Is there a simpler way to do this, or a way that keeps the assembly bodies linked to the boolean operations while also having them show up as distinct components of the assembly (like how a Sketch or Surface can be used to define a feature but can also appear elsewhere and visible in the product tree)?

63,LightBlue Bean/GEMMA circuits and requisite components; what parts do I need?,1475061342,"So I have two problems; one of them I believe to be fairly easy and the other might be a little tougher.

Question 1: I'm making an LED hoodie. I have a GEMMA microcontroller and 2 meters of [this LED strip](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2432). The datasheet can be found [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/2343/APA102C.pdf). I don't know how to read this datasheet well enough to know what kind of amperage it would pull with all the LEDs at full brightness (60 LEDs). 

What I would like to do is connect the GEMMA, the LED strip and a power source to a potentiometer or encoder that allows me to turn it to switch between different light patterns: solid white, blinking, running around the perimeter, etc. The major unknowns: how much battery power (in mAh) would I need to run all 2 meters at full brightness for 4 hours? 8 hours? Additionally, do I need components beyond power source, light strip, knob, microcontroller? I've heard the term ""pull-up resistor"" thrown around and it sounds like some kind of signal conditioning use of a resistor. I've done the blinky thing with an Arduino, so I get the basics of this, but are there ""best practice"" types of circuit additions that I wouldn't get in the basics?

Question 2, corollary: I'm making a glove with a LightBlue Bean and 2 flex sensors.

My question is about the counterweight system (photo 7/105 shows a good angle).  Different from other vertical lift bridges, there are many counterweights (and differing sizes) on each side versus the two symmetrical weights most designs use.  I figure it has to do with the pulleys and the angle the cables come off but I was hoping someone has a good breakdown of pulleys and how the cable's angle affects load required.

90,Mechanical Engineering : Fabric Collector,1474894184,"Hello there

I am currently working on a project where I have to figure out a way to clean a mixture from trash, the trash are coming with the coal reserve. The coal is drop into a hopper and then onto a conveyor which leads it in the coal plant.

It is a very fine coal mixture and constantly trash like metals, rubber and fabric are found in it. This causes problem, tripping/damaging equipment and blocking pipes, further down the process. What I was thinking was some magnets for the metallic parts and a grid with some spikes on it so that fabric is attached onto it and not proceed further down the process. The only problem is that the grid will wear out very fast considering that the spikes point is very thing. So a spiked grid doesn't seem like an efficient solution. I was wondering if there is a way to protect it from wearing out (coat it with a stronger material or use a highly abrasion resistant material) or even better a different idea that would do the trick. 

I already had a quick research about cement and lime plant but I couldn't get much info about how they get rid of trash.

This had previously never been an issue as the old pump's dynamics were able to maintain relatively constant pressure in the header. 

So, I'm curious as to what best practices are for a header system such as this. 

1. Is it standard practice for a system with multiple level controls/control valves to maintain a constant pressure in the header? Would speed control help this, or tack on even more complex dynamics?

26,From technical sales to R&amp;D - anyone?,1474669167,"Hello guys, I need some advice. But first a not-so-short introduction.
As most of young engineering graduates, as soon as I finished my studies (Master's degree in Mechatronics Eng) I started looking 
for jobs in the R&amp;D department. Honestly that's what you expect to do according to the education you got, the months spent behind 
Matlab/Simulink and all those exercises you've made. 

Personally I've always been interested in the robotics and control field, even if I have limited hands-on experience 
(I've studied in a pretty good Italian technical university, but mostly theoretical stuff). Impatience combined with lack of 
experience made me think that 6 months of job seeking were enough. 
A good and reliable company, supplier of machines for the aerospace, power generation and automotive manufacturing lines, 
has contacted me. I knew this company beforehand, and they knew me because months earlier I tried to apply for a - guess what - R&amp;D position 
within a specializing master project they had in cooperation with my university, but after two successful 
steps in the hiring process they did not choose me. 
So, after months they call me back. I listen to their offer: they are looking for a sales engineer that has to manage the 
European area, working with big customer names. I wow at all those benefits and perks the position entails, I think about it and after 
a couple of weeks I accept. Why not, if I change my mind I can always switch position later, right? 

It's been now almost four months, and I'm learning everyday new product features and how to relate and manage colleagues and customers.
I'm flying frequently to the US (the product I'm selling is manufactured there) and I love it.
As many other people already said elsewhere in this subreddit, there are many nice things about this job: 
you get to know a broad range of people, you get to know the industry, you understand how companies work, you have contacts 
with the top ranks of the company, you have a great number of responsibilities, etc. It is indeed a job that, if done well, 
prepares you for management and, financially speaking, rewards you. 

Everything is great so far, except one thing: I'm scared I'll never design anything in my life again. 

I graduated with the highest grades and I sometimes I feel like I'm ""wasting"" all the theoretical technical knowledge that I've learned over 6 years of studies and I'm never going to apply them. 

I have a broad range of interests. I like control systems and systems engineering. I like design. I'm fascinated by medical robotics and the startups world.
I decided to keep on learning technical stuff while I can.
I'd like to get a better understanding of how complex systems work. I know that at some point I need to make a decision; the thing is that I'd like to continue with this job at least for a couple of years, before jumping to conclusions.

The main question here is if anybody with a strongly technical degree has ever made it to switch to technical position after a few years in sales.
This is not the usual and I know it's not likely to happen often, but I don't want to have my career decided at 26.
I don't even know if I can handle negotiations completely by myself.

I hope that, learning something by myself and being in contact with the right people of the company, I can maybe have a small window open for the future, if I realize that this 
is not the best fitting job for me. My boss has plans for me, and I don't want to talk to anybody yet of this, it's indeed too soon.

This board is also used to know which rig/platform they are going to, when they are coming back from rigs, if they have any vacation scheduled and if they are on loan to other locations.

The problem: Most times we get sent offshore, we don't know how long are we supposed to be out there for. More often than not, we  have to stay longer, because our relief had vacation scheduled. Or people get sent out to a rig/platform on really short notice...like 12hrs.

What I need, is a software where we can enter everybody's schedules, with vacations, and if I need to check personnel availability for specific dates, I can enter the dates and it will give the who's going to be available.

I've just finished up a phone interview with a company across the country, and I'll most likely get flown in for an in-person interview. I'll probably have to take a vacation day to do the interview.

Regarding my old job, what's the general etiquette towards my manager and team? Because I'm the only one who does my job, I don't want to leave my team scrambling with a two week notice. However, I'm afraid my manager or team may harbor some resentment if I tell them I'm leaving. If I don't get the job, it would be a pretty toxic atmosphere, making my job of working with all of them more difficult.

Would managers generally be helpful (i.e. give me a good recommendation, help me pass on my role to a replacement easily, etc.) if they found out somebody is interviewing elsewhere? I want to leave the team is a decent condition, and not have them struggle if I leave suddenly. I could help train somebody else to do my job, introduce them to my contacts, etc.

40,Server for management of automated testing of physical resources?,1474646072,"I'm about to undertake what might be a pretty large project at work, and I'd really like some advice and ideas from more experienced engineers before proceeding.  I've put a bit of background below, which I'd recommend reading because I'm not sure the terminology I am using in the TL;DR below is even correct.

Thanks for thoughts or advice you might be able to provide! 

**Edit: Please let me know if there might be a better place to ask this question.**

-----

I work for a test and measurement equipment company, and I am spearheading a push towards more thorough validation of our nightly firmware builds.  The tricky part is that the tests I need to run must be performed on physical hardware such as analyzers and signal generators. 

A highly generalized example of the test flow for many of these tests is as follows:

1. install (potentially buggy/broken) firmware on measurement device
2. connect working signal generator to measurement device 
3. measure the signal coming out of the generator using the test equipment to determine if the firmware has issues

There are a few things I've run into that make this difficult to automate.  

* **First**, test signals must be routed around from certain generators to certain receivers.  *This part is a solved problem, and we have large switch matrices that can be remotely controlled to connect just about anything to anything else.*  
* **Second**, not all tests can be performed on every measurement device, because some devices offer additional features due to their enhanced/additional hardware.  
* **Third**, some tests require multiple measurement devices and all of them are unable to be used for anything else while testing.  
* **Fourth**, developers must have a way to mark a device as reserved so that the automation system doesn't steal it if they are in the middle of working.

In general terms, what I would like is a system that runs as many tests as possible on the newest firmware it can find, every day, using as many measurement devices as are free. Different tests will have differing needs, varying from requiring ANY available measurement device to requiring a 3-4 specific devices. 

I've looked into Jenkins as a possible solution for managing and prioritizing these tests, but I'm skeptical of how a CI automation tool it might fare considering with all the physical resource constraints above.

-----

TL;DR: Seeking recommendations for software to automate firmware testing in a small lab and keep measurement equipment busy running tests as often as possible.  Jenkins initially doesn't seem like quite the right fit because I am working almost exclusively with physical resources.  What alternatives are geared more towards automation/synchronization of specialized hardware resources?

61,Engineers that get their hands dirty?,1474546767,"Hello! Sorry for the wall of text coming up, I'm on mobile. Anyway, I'm curious about engineering fields where there is opportunity to be more hands on in mechanical aspects. I graduated in 2014 with a BS in physics, and minors in math and chemistry. Along the way I learned some basic CAD on ProE and it was enough (Also with the help of a connection) to land my first Mechanical Designing job which I worked until last March. The job also taught me SolidWorks and AutoCAD. 

Since leaving that job (long story why), I've been doing a lot of construction jobs and working in bars to make ends meet. I love getting dirty and being tired from exhaustion at the end of they day, but I want to use my mind more. I plan to go back to Grad school to get a masters in engineering, but I'm having a really hard time picking a direction that would be best for me.

I've heard of RC channel for the ceiling, but i suspect that wouldn't do too much. I could build another ceiling below the current one. Maybe if I pulled up the carpet in the upper unit I could remove the planks and put down plywood with some type of noise barrier mat. As the walls are hollow and run contiguously between the units on the outer walls, I imagine something needs to be done there to stop noise from travelling in through receptacles and down the walls. I could remove the lower part of the 2nd floor walls and install fire blocks to help prevent noise from travelling downwards... Its difficult for me to tell if the noise is coming through the ceiling/floor or through the walls.

I am trying to make a coaxial driven wheel.  Basically I want a powered wheel that can rotate infinitely with the motor mounted above, stationary.

The problem with that is that with a normal swerve module, resisting or stopping the wheel's movement causes the torque being applied to the wheel to rotate the entire module.  This doesn't happen in robots that use swerve as they have a second motor set to independently control the rotation of the module, preventing it from rotating on its own.  I'm looking for ways to combat that without introducing more motors or slip rings.  I would love to know if anybody here has any thoughts on the matter.

I'm just an ignorant chemist looking to make something fun, while also replacing my current mode of transportation.

I was thinking of converting an old bicycle/scooter of mine into something that I could ride for about 10 miles (16 km), at a reasonable speed. My goal is to have something that I can ride to work and back, while cutting down on my current gas consumption. 

What I thought would work, would be to scrap an old weed whacker, and using a chain, hook it up to the back axle of the bike. I'm not sure if that will provide adequate power, or if I will need a bigger motor.

79,Am I overqualified for my role as a design engineer?,1474493144,"Im going to provide a little backstory since its may be necessary to my concerns. I graduated a few years ago with a masters in mechanical engineering. Looking for work and becoming desperate i took a sales based engineering role in the energy industry; it wasnt perfect work but it was decent experience and a foot in the door of the engineering world. 


After one year i was laid off due to companies financial struggles. I only gained a years worth of experience but I felt it was worthwhile. I realized i didnt want to work in sales and started looking for more actual engineering based work. I landed a job as a Junior Design Engineer for a company that manufactures commercial vehicles, despite my 1 year experience I wanted to get into design so accepted a junior position . The company itself is quite small and works on design jobs for much bigger companies who lack particular expertise. 


The role required me to brush up on some CAD skills from university and really engage with the design process, however this is my first role in design.


However, overtime ive noticed the work seems rather slow (im coming up to 10 weeks in the job). Occasionally im being asked to do real menial tasks drawing up parts and sometimes things unrelated to actual design of the vehicles. There are a couple of other junior engineers who were taken on at the same time as me. Having spoken to them they dont possess degrees and only HNC's in engineering (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_National_Certificate) basically the equivalent of 1 year at university in the UK. 

I dont mean to look down on my co-workers but it started to make me panic. Am I working a job that is not making full use of my potential? 

Is this normal work for this kind of job title (obviously all jobs are different but was hoping for some insight from others in a similar role)?

Anyone with a career in design based engineering have any insight as to how their careers begun?

A big concern of mine is that i am now 25 years old and graduated 2 years ago. Due to losing my first job after such a short period of time I feel i had essentially lost a year. To be in a job that might even be a step behind my degree (if that makes sense?) would make me lose more time. Does this sound like the kind of work that will help me have a good career or am i running out of time to secure the required engineering skills to make good of myself?


(I should note it isnt all menial CAD tasks, i have been given a few conceptual design jobs for example how to position certain components, designing various parts of the vehicle. But it all seems very ""un-mathematical"" and more ""do what you think will work"")

My plan is to make an mold with it, then melt it, and then cast the propeller out of aluminum. I'm wondering about melting the part, because I'm not sure if it will flow out of the mold on its own, or if I will have to find a way to push it out.

I can print it out of PLA or ABS. From what I've seen from spec sheets from the vendors of the filament, the melting point for both is roughly 220ÂºC, 430ÂºF, but I've read that ABS doesn't really become liquid, since it has no crystalline structure. I've searched and found about the Melt Flow Index (MFI) that is used to compare different polymers for injection molding, and I'm wondering if that can be applied to my problem.

What I've seen is that the MFI is based on the material being pushed out of the machine by a piston. In my case, it would have to flow by itself, with gravity being the only force. The MFI for the PLA is 7,8g/10min and for the ABS it is 5g/10 min (49N) and 50g/10 min (98N).",AskEngineers,dudsht,/r/AskEngineers/comments/53vf4v/question_about_melt_flow_index_and_melting/

97,Switch from Computer Science to Mechanical Engineering?,1474470631,"Hello,
I'm currently a CS major at a local state school, and over the past year or so, I've been playing around with the idea of switching to mechanical engineering. I enjoy both disciplines equally, though I have more experience with software. Because CS seems like it would be easier to self-teach than ME, I think I could ""kill two birds with one stone"", by majoring in ME, and learning CS on the side.
My ultimate goal is to have my own business within either one of these two fields, though obviously I am prepared to work for a number of years before giving that a try. CS seems like it would lend itself better to self-employment because of the smaller overhead, however.
The problem with switching is that I'm already half-way through my degree (I have 2 more years left, if everything goes well). By changing to ME, I'd effectively delay my graduation by at least a year (and likely more), and cost me an additional $10K+. In addition, just a year ago I wasn't considering ME at all, so there's a chance that my interests may change again. Obviously this choice is not ideal, but I wouldn't want to be precluded from pursuing ME.
One solution I've thought of is to simply complete my CS degree, and - if I'm still interested in ME by then - go back to school for a second BS (a second one would take less than 4 years, I believe). Another solution is to complete the CS degree, but simply keep ME as a hobby. I'm largely self-motivated, so I figure that I could learn certain ME topics on my own. Perhaps I could even attempt to roll out a customer product.

I've been toying with the idea of building a greenhouse with heat storage to stabilize the greenhouse climate a bit.

I mean I could always use a bunch of rain water barrels and throw some insulation arouns them, but it seems ugly and inefficient.

What I would like to do is store the water underneath the greenhouse, which might be 10 square meters or so. I'm thinking at least 2 cubic meters of water. Ideally in one big pool, not separate containers. This would reduce complexity with hoses and connections between different container elements.

So it needs to contain the water, but also carry the greenhouse. 

How would you design such a reservoir? From what materials? I was thinking maybe plywood that you waterproof with rubber paint(the kind used for waterproofing bathrooms) but I'm not sure how practical that is.

Also, there is no soil where I plan to build the greenhouse. It's just solid rock, so it needs to be on top of that.

6,Linear actuator or solenoid?,1474428774,"Hey guys, title pretty much sums it up.  

Requirements:  
  
* High speed, 2 IPS min, the faster the better 
* 12VDC
* ~2"" stroke 
* Has to maintain set position on both ends (push-pull/dual acting)
* 50lb load minimum (prefer around 200 for added chooch factor)

My perfect solution is a solenoid that just slams from stop to stop with a single button press. Unfortunately perusing McMaster and cursory google searches haven't returned any dual acting solenoids that have a stroke longer than 1"".  If it comes down to it I could probably bell-crank around this limitation, but I prefer not to. 

I've found a few acceptable linear actuators, but they're much larger, heavier, and slower. The upside being they hold set position (generally) but rocker-switch operation is a little more complex than I'd prefer.

This cannot obstruct normal behavior, and the kid shouldn't really be aware he or she is wearing it.  

It cannot be so tight as to constrict the head, for obvious reasons.  The munchkin's head is not fully formed at birth, and I don't want to mess with head shape or blood flow.

It would have to be wireless, and data storage will have to be solved (I could get lots of external hard drives, but getting the data there without compromising the data may be challenging.

For this to remain a valid scientific method, I'd have to have some assurance that normal head movement and looking behavior is not altered by the presence of this thing.  

Again, point of the project would be to start to characterize the statistics of the early visual environment.  The ratio of horizontal to vertical to oblique information, the amount of time that faces are in the visual field, etc.

I could probably apply for some money or get a kickstarter going, but I won't have some huge grant to fall back on (I'm a young academic in a teaching position at a university).

I'm really just brainstorming at this stage about feasibility, so please throw ideas at me regarding potential equipment, obstacles, and whatever else you can think of.  We plan on having a second kid at some point, so even if I had a prototype going for this first kid, that would be a huge step towards making it happen with the second one.  

Thanks in advance.

In an effort to update the look and give users more flexibility, we're planning to update the subreddit style. Naut 2.3 (our current css template) is over 2 years old now, and while it's very functional, it's also difficult to update and lacks some nice features such as colored flair. My initial plan was to update to [Naut 4.0](/r/naut), but I dislike it for various reasons so I decided to go with another template called Structura.

Head over to **/r/AskEngineersCSS** and have a poke around to get a feel for the new look. It will be unlocked for the entire week if you want to make test posts. For a full look list of every element, go [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Structura/comments/4gvh67/structura_elements/).

The mods have already been tweaking and debugging code over the weekend, but there are undoubtedly bugs that we've missed.

###Poll

Once you're done looking, please take 15 seconds to respond to this poll: https://www.strawpoll.me/11259012

If you don't like the new style for some reason, we'd really appreciate any feedback you have on how it can be improved, or if you simply prefer the current style. Either way, leave a comment with the reason for your preference so we can understand why and make more improvements.

Generally though, a needle is placed at the desired ablation site, and a ground pad is placed somewhere else on the patient. Then a high frequency signal is conducted via the patient's body from the needle to the grounding pad.

First of all there is obviously heat being produced simply by the region of high current density near the needle. But I assume there is also EM radiation being emitted at the needle tip heating the tissue. Otherwise the name of the procedure seems a bit silly. But this leads me to a few questions.

* If RF is being generated, why is most of it emitted at the tip? If it is being emitted across the length of the cable, why doesn't holding the cable result in burns or heating sensations?

83,Advice on dealing with an (increasingly) worse job,1474133561,"I took an internship over the summer across the country from where I lived with the federal government.  The department which I am in does engineering but they also do several other things very different from engineering.

During the time I was there several people left and the management structure changed.  So totally different management than the few months before.  But the old management seemed pretty good so when the new management offered me a position I said I would take it.  (I transition from intern to regular hire quite soon.)

Increasingly, under this new management, this job has gotten steadily more awful.  When I interviewed I was very explicit that I had a date for my FE exam set and that I expected to receive the sort of training which would lead to my PE, eventually.  I handed my boss the requirements of the kind of work that is expected and as far as I could tell, there was a pretty explicit understanding that this is the sort of work I would be doing.  My bosses boss even had a discussion with me about exactly how they planned on doing it.

Until about two weeks ago when someone else in the department decided to take another job elsewhere and I was told I would fill in for her duties indefinitely.  This wasn't even told to me directly.  My boss said I was doing it ""For now."" and then when he was talking to someone else in the field about my duties he said I would be doing it ""indefinitely.""

When I complained to him about the difference between expectation when I accepted the job and the expectations now and how they had changed so drastically he pretty much said ""Tough shit.  You can transfer out after your probation period.""  My probation is 2 years.  he also said I could get work in engineering eventually and pretty much I had to be patient about it but I was doing this other thing indefinitely.  So I'm not sure how that translates into fulfilling anything I asked for.  It seems more like ""We didn't lie to you, because you'll get one of the few things you asked for in your interview, eventually, at a time of our choosing.""

In addition, he hasn't told the person who is training me work completely unrelated to engineering that this is neither my field nor my interest so I had to explain this all to her, because she couldn't figure out why I wasn't showing that much interest in what she is training me in.

In addition to this, my boss often makes inappropriate jokes about women in the workplace, often to my face.  And maybe this would be less of a problem for me if the office I am in made it clear in any other way that they cared about my career goals.

I plan on quitting in 3 months if I don't have any other job offers, move back home, and do nothing but job search and study for my FE (if I don't pass it the first time).  Also, I was taken on as a regular hire, not in the recent graduates program.  Any other advice on how to deal with this situation?  Also, advice on applying to other federal jobs now?

87,How to politely tell operators that I do not have time to address minor inconveniences?,1474084136,"I sound like a dick, I know. But as the sole engineer in my department, I get inundated with requests for very minor things that would take up a large amount of time that I just don't have. How do you nicely tell a person that you don't have time to work on what they are asking?

To be fair, if it is a request that is causing large amounts of downtime or quality issues, I will absolutely try my best to address it. But, for example, I had an operator ask me to break two mirrored displays into two individual displays. It takes one button push to flip to the other screen, but they want them both up at the same time. Since I inherited this department, I have no idea how the computers are tied together, how to open two instances of an identical program on two different computers. It would take me at least half a day to figure out how to tackle, and I just can't fit it into my schedule.

This is just one request I can think of that I got this week. Others include lowering a huge piece of equipment six inches so they can reach in easier (they want to be able to reach from the ground instead of having to stand on a stool), which would take moving drives, motors, and chains out of the way. It's just not feasible to spend time and (a LOT of) money on this issue when the bottom line is that is just an inconvenience to them. Not to mention, I'd have absolutely no way to justify the spending when requesting the money (they seem to think I have an endless budget though)...

But I understand, to the operators, this is their daily life and these are real issues to them. So I don't want to brush them off as minor, and want to make them feel like I do care about the issues, but it's just not possible to spend the time addressing when there are bigger fires to fight. And there are countless other examples where this comes from.

I'd also like to note, this is just for huge requests that have no possible chance of happening. If it only takes 10 minutes of my time to address something, I'll do my best to knock it out as soon as possible.

I'm a new grad and I have two job offers sitting on my plate. I'm am EE who isn't 100% convinced I want to stay in engineering in the future. 

The two jobs are working for the government doing controls work or working for a private firm doing EE related defense work. The pay is about equal, however, I'd be living in a new city for the defense contractor as opposed to at home (no rent) for the government. 

Is there anything to consider when choosing a career path this early on? I don't want to be working in controls my whole life for sure as I've read lots about engineers who get stuck in the industry (you can correct me if I'm wrong).

23,Got an engineering question from my boss. The problem is: I'm not an engineer. Advice?,1473970195,"Hello all you brilliant people!

First, I am going to have to explain the background because I feel this will be rather long-winded. The current situation is I have been working at a small company for about six months (let's call it Company X) and I have been working on the more technical sides of things at Company X. Company X is a chemical company and the chemical is related to biology. Now, my background involves chemistry and biology so there are no problems there, and for the most part the job has been going great.

However, the other day my boss emailed me: *Can you design a system that has a chemical injection pump plus a 10""  filter cartridge for 1.5"" water line?*

I don't know where to even begin. I think my boss believes that because I have a science background I therefore must know some engineering. Which isn't the case at all. I've never taken a single engineering course. I'm not one to tinker with household appliances or DIY home repair. Heck, I don't even build my own computers. The closest thing to engineering I've done is setting up a makeshift shake incubator for an experiment involving algae - and that involved a lot of tape.

&amp;nbsp;

So I have three questions for some actual engineers:

Question 1. *Does my boss's question even make sense?* 

I mean, I'm no engineer, but for one thing isn't 10'' bigger than 1.5''? Plus, the question seems to be rather sparse on specifics. And if you are thinking context would help, well there's not a lot of extra context I can provide. The question I gave you was exactly how it was given to me. All I can add is that the chemical being injected is most certainly our company's chemical which would be in an aqueous solution (although my boss didn't even make that clear). The filter on the other hand I think might be a product from this other company my boss has been talking about lately that I know next to nothing about (frankly this other company looks very sketchy to me, a different product of theirs talks about making better tasting water using ""natural earth frequencies""), or maybe he's simply talking about a generic filter cartridge, if there is such as thing I certainly wouldn't know.

&amp;nbsp;

Question 2. *Can anyone tell me where to start?*

I'm not here asking for someone to answer my boss's question for me, it is my job and my responsibility, but if anyone can point me in the right direction that would help a lot. For example are there online resources and tutorials that could teach me how to design something similar, or would I actually need to take an engineering class (or several classes)? In fact, what would a design even look like? Would I just need to draw something out on paper or are there computer programs for making mechanical designs? I tried looking this sort of stuff up on my own and all I found was information on car engines and oil wells, which for all I know actually is the right direction.

&amp;nbsp;

Question 3. *Any advice on how to tell my boss I am not an engineer?*

This is ultimately the crux of it. A big part of why I want to learn more about how to do what my boss is asking is so I know what it is I don't know. If I know what it is he's asking from me and what it would take to answer it, then I feel I can respond with something a little more thoughtful than: ""Nope. Not an engineer. Can't do it."" Because even if, by some miracle, I somehow do manage to come back to him with a working design after a few hours puttering around online, I will still need to tell him I can't be expected to do this sort of thing in the future. Engineering doesn't really seem to be a field where I can 'fake it till I make it'.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I appreciate all your help and consideration! And if you would like to tease me for knowing nothing about a different branch of the STEM, then by all means have at it! :P

&amp;nbsp;

UPDATE EDIT: I quickly emailed my boss just a bit ago based on the great feedback you folks have given me. This is what I told him:

In regards to the chemical injection pump, I do not believe I can design a system like that by myself. With more information I am confident someone with an engineering background would have no problems designing and even making it. Namely, what will this thing be used for?

25,Job Hunting Issues - Advice,1473965629,"Hello all, 

I posted in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4zoo95/career_advice_take_mechanical_engineer_role_over/) about a mechanical engineering role and an automation engineer role. I got a phone screen for the mechanical engineer role, but they decided not to interview me. This was a big surprise for me as I had a co-op with them and they gave me great reviews on my exit interview. My guess is that they wanted a mechanical engineer graduate, not industrial.

I still have not got an offer for the Automation Engineer role I interviewed for (mostly managerial maintenance role, little time for messing with PLC's and designing improvements as expected with other Automation Engineer roles).

Here is my current standing:

* I graduate in December with B.S in Industrial Engineering, Minor in Mathematics, Greenbelts in Lean and Six Sigma
* Working for the company I interviewed until December as intern, working at machine shop on campus too.
* Will be taking FE in November
* Only taking my senior design course right now
* Have submitted 30 + applications since August, have been declined 5, heard only from these two companies.
* Talked to several companies at career fair, haven't heard back yet (1 week since talking to them)
* GPA not great, 2.8 overall, 3.0+ in major.
* Co-op (8 months), internship (7 months), and machine shop experience (2+ years on and off)
* Comfortable coding in VBA/VBScript and miscellaneous C based scripts

My Questions:

* 1.) Should I spend time applying for internships for the spring? I really can't afford not to be working after I graduate, I figure trying to have at least an internship for the spring should soften that blow.

* 2.) Should I hire a headhunter to try and get me interviews? How much would that cost?

* 3.) Anyone know of good opportunities for Industrial Engineers?

* 4.) I do not have my GPA on my resume, is this hurting me or helping me?

Thanks in advance!

**TLDR**

Should a recent graduate apply for internships if they dont have a job lined up, are headhunters worth it, any companies that are looking for industrial engineers, should I have my GPA on my resume even if its bad?

One part of the project thatâs currently confusing me is the loading that the structure will make on the concrete. The loading is approximately 4950 lbs for the structure and 2200 lbs for the bags. The loading is to be split split between 4 legs ([as seen in this drawing]( http://imgur.com/a/FxNCz)). For the purposes of this question I am assuming that the loading will always be uniform throughout each leg. 

The specification of the concrete is [as shown in the picture](http://imgur.com/a/CHZm8). A structural engineer in the past has told a colleague that this concrete can take up to 1000 psf, however I have not been able to verify this.

**My question is** how do you calculate the loading on the concrete for this area? The way I assumed you calculate the loading would be to take 1/4th the weight of the structure (~1789 lbs) and divide that by the area from the footing of the structure (8â x 8â). The structural engineer is saying that to get the psf loading they take the width and length of the footprint of the footing (aka the 49â x 67â). The total weight of the structure is divided by the footprint.

What should a fresh college-graduate with a lack of experience do?,1473796194,"Hi, I'm not here looking for someone to tell me that things will be alright so I should keep my head up. I am genuinely scared for my life right now because next week will mark the 4th month without employment since I have graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.


First and foremost, my GPA has never been really that high (sitting around 3.0) so I've always struggled to find internships through out college. Luckily, I landed an mechanical engineering internship during my last semester of college which I am extremely grateful for. Within the last few months, I have applied to nearly 300-400 job positions and have only heard back from a handful.


Today, I received a rejection call from one of the few companies that were interested in me. I am thankful for the interview opportunity because they flew me out there and provided the financial aspect. In the call, the engineer informed me that they went with someone who is more experienced and was a former intern there. He mentioned that there are other job posted on their website if I am interested in that. Would it be wrong if I applied for an internship/co-op for the same company (maybe for a different location)? Most of the internship positions requires you to still be in school, including this one. Will this give the employer a bad impression of me for downgrading from a potential full-time candidate to an internship candidate?


I am at a loss right now and I really need to figure out a decision because I don't have much time left. I am really starting to consider applying for a regular job doing either retail or food industry because I can't sit around all day anymore. Should I just give up on my engineering career?

Quoting for convenience:

A bungee cord inside of the tubes keeps the sections together so that all you need to do is stretch it straight and fit the sections into each other. Its height can be raised for badminton When taken apart, the entire net fits into a small, slim bag. It stands on its own and does not need to be staked, so it can be used on grass or on a hard surface.

Today I had a shower thought and brain fart about PVC piping.  I know that PVC piping shouldn't be used in a pressure situation, but I was curious about the affects of the joining method and strength behind solid/taper ended PVC pipes.

I know that in steel pipes, the actual pipe body is much stronger than its connection, (ie flanged or threaded), but is this theory also true for PVC piping connections, for both glued and threaded PVC pipe?  I looked at some failure images of PVC piping and it looks like most of their failures happen at the body of the pipe, and not so much at the connection.  I have also read that the connections of a PVC pipe, when cemented or glued is actually labeled as a chemical weld of some kind, where the cement creates a fusible chemical reaction between the two joining PVC ends.

Yes, a faulty connection will probably fail before the pipe, but lets assume the connection was perfect and professionally done.  In this case, in an over pressurized scenario, what will fail first, the pipe body or glued connection?  Also same for a dynamically loaded over pressure scenario?

**PROS**

* Company is a name that everyone knows and respects.

* It is my job to learn, in detail, about complex engineering systems.

* I do have periodic access to engineers, and can even get a mentor who is an engineer.

* There will be SOME hands on experience gained, with the system that I work with.

* I really like the company and have been enjoying myself so far.


**CONS**

* Not actual engineering experience, but I have an engineering title.

* Though I am supposed to know a lot about the systems that I work with (Basically a head to toe list on system components and their function), most of that knowledge is only gained through books and pictures.

87,Need help on how to calculate pressures for a basic pump to tank and tank to barrel.,1473757335,"   So i'm trying to get rough numbers (don't really need exacts) for an air rifle i'm going to build soon. And I'm trying to figuring out how much each cycle of the pump will add to the tank. And when the tank is fully released into the barrel (not accounting for minor air leaks) how much pressure will be put out into the barrel. Also if possible would love to know how to figure out what the possible velocity for the ball for be, on release.

   Anyways here are some of the rough numbers, if they help in telling what i'm going for. The pumps compression area is 12"" long and .75"" wide, with a volume of 5.30 inch3. Going into a tank that is 8"" long and 1.5"" inch wide with a volume of 14.13 inch3. That will then flow into a barrel which is 12"" long and .25"" wide with a volume of 0.58 inch3. Now the atmospheric pressure i'll be dealing with will be about 13.31 PSI. And the minimal pressure I wish to get the air tank to before release is 100 PSI but the plan is to reach 500 PSI (since it's a more practical pressure) unless that forces the barrel past 1000 PSI when released. Now sadly I don't have the valve numbers, but it's most likely will be a basic ball with o-ring type design. But seems like the valve has a volume for the air to flow through of about 0.0110447 in3, if the ball is 0.25"" and the valve is 0.5"".

   Also if you guys know of any resources that you think might be helpful for me in figuring out other stuff related to this project.

Quantitatively, how does this affect the car's performance in a straight line?",1473708784,"Most discussions I've seen focus on the ""unsprung"" part of this question. The consensus is that dropping a pound of ""unsprung"" weight (weight that is not supported by the suspension, such as the flywheel, driveshafts, brakes and wheels) equates to a bigger drop in ""sprung"" weight. I've seen wildly different claims as to what the actual ratio is. Some say 1:2, others 1:20. So my first question is - what are the equations behind this, and what's the actual ratio?
My second question relates to the fact that that wheels also rotate (which stores energy that must then be dissipated by the brakes or via tire friction). Most discussions i've seen concerning the effect of changing to lightweight wheels ignore this rather obvious fact.
Taking it all together, i want to know by how much does performance increase if we go from 32lb 19 inch wheels to 22 inch 19 inch wheels, assuming a 3800 lb car that puts out 370 horses at the wheels?

What brings me to this subreddit is that, although my intuition tells me that it should be significant, i'm not sure of the numbers. And the discussions on google are not particularly illuminating. Let's suppose, for instance, that we take the car to a drag strip. With the heavier wheels, the car will have about 40 lbs of added rotational unsprung mass (for simplicity, let's assume it's all at the edge of the wheel).

It seemed riddled with errors about water treatment and a healthy dose of sensationalism, but did get me thinking about how the process works. Trihalomethanes are a disinfection biproduct that can cause corrosion and would be a problem in lead pipes. My question is that if wastewater initially containing a high level of THM's goes through treatment, would they be removed during the flocculation, coagulation, and sedimentation stages of treatment or is it impossible to get rid of them entirely?

99,Custom made EV trike's performance did not go as planned!,1473702828,"Hello,

My friends and I recently built a reverse trike EV. The vehicle weighs around 400-450 kgs with batteries, space frame, etc including the passanger. 
Our motor was a 3 KW BLDC motor powered by 4 - 12V batteries for a total of 48 V, and 100 Ah. Our drive ratio was 1:4 (motor sprocket had 10 teeth, rear sprocket had 40 teeth). Based on our initial calculations we were supposed to (theoretically) achieve a speed of 50-60 km/hr. After speaking to the motor supplier, he assured us that our calculations were correct. However, after today's testing, we didn't even get to 10 mph on a straight road, not to mention our acceleration was super slow. I've seen golf carts being easily driven by 1 KW motors, without much problems. I've even see E-rickshaws in Asian countries that run on 1 KW motors, 48 V batteries, 100 Ah, and carry easily 400-500 kgs and achieve 30-35 mph!
Where did we go wrong? Any ideas or advice would be very much appreciated! The reverse trike is simple in concept. 


Update:  So it was a controller issue. We changed some of the settings and it worked wonderfully. We also changed the back sprocket to have more teeth. We can easily achieve 35-40 mph on a straight road, however we still have a slight issue of going uphill. Our motor simply isn't powerful enough to power a 500-600 kg vehicle up a rather steep incline. Planning on going for a 5 KW motor or even a 10 KW one to be on the safer side.

Thank you all for your suggestions and input. Much appreciated",AskEngineers,king_zilla,/r/AskEngineers/comments/52fneb/custom_made_ev_trikes_performance_did_not_go_as/

does it have a fixed magnet?

what is that yellow thing? Is it a condensator of current?

if the same system, with the same coils, would experience a current of 220 volts instead of 110 volts, would it create more power? I mean, does more intensity of current creates a more intense magnetic field, and so, more power?

I thought this wasnt true but recently my cousin recently graduated from Uni of Toronto in chemical engineering (which I've heard is very much in demand) but he couldn't land a job for it.
Due to this I am kind of pressurizing myself to pursue a career as a doctor. i am very conflicted about this, I am 50/50. And just to be clear I do like math physics and biology so would not mind doing either medicine or engineering but i tend to lean towards engineering.

I would like to know if the whole thing about many engineers being unemployed or having bad jobs is true and also which engineering field will be the most in demand in the coming years.

57,[Simple question] Am I on the right track with my math and design process?,1473407064,"So preface, I'm pretty much self teaching myself mechanical engineering, so when I miss something, that's why.  The only other knowledge I have is of a physics course in high school. So please bare with me. 

Here is the rod I'll be using for the main frame of the structure.
[https://www.rockwestcomposites.com/rods-shapes/round-pultruded-solid-rod/47311](https://www.rockwestcomposites.com/rods-shapes/round-pultruded-solid-rod/47311)

And here is the data sheet for the epoxy and a general idea of the structure I'm building. (The design is nowhere near final.)
[http://imgur.com/a/vygM5?reg](http://imgur.com/a/vygM5?reg)

For this part of the design, the goal is that the part be able to withstand 1,500 psi from tensile, compression and sheer forces. 

Each carbon fiber rod has a diameter of .375"" with a total area of each rod being 0.11"". And the support rings holding the rods together is made out of aluminum. 6061 specifically because that's what inventor suggested. 

If the rods have 270,000 psi compression strength does that mean with 20 rods the structure would be able to withstand 594,000 pounds of force?

In terms of tensile strength, with a total of 320,000 psi, the structure would be able to withstand 704,000 pounds of tensile force. 

Now with tensile force being applied to the structure, would the epoxy itself be the first part to fail because of it being able to only withstand ~11,000 psi? If my math is right, using 20 3/8 rods would yield a total strength of  ~24,200 pounds total.

This may seem like a common sense thing for you guys but I just want to make sure that I'm not designing my project on false pretenses. From what I've seen, defining what your goals are and then designing to meet the goal is considered a good practice.

60,Injection molding process plastic preforms troubleshooting!,1473381800,"Hello everyone, I am new here and I didn't exactly know where to ask the questions I have so I thought I'd post them here for guidance.

So I work for a business where I have to do quality control and inspections on Injection molded preforms of plastics. Lately, the machine has been getting stuck... ALOT. This problem is only with the clear preforms that we make and its starting to get to a point where the client is actually frustrated with the quality of the preforms. I've been doing a lot of digging but I couldn't find a solution to the problem myself because I just started working here and this is my ""first"" engineering job. The usual problem that occurs is that when the mold opens up after the ejection, one of the preforms either doesn't fall, which hence makes us stop the machine for a good 10-20 second and re-start again, which makes waste to the next cycles batch. 

I tried looking into the whole Ionization curtain situation, but I'm not sure how much that would help considering there is barely any static in the preforms created (just the clear ones from what I have seen).

What I want to ask is, what do you think are the causes of this? So you think that the HVAC of the entire area is affecting the process? Maybe the machine? I do have to tell that the mold we are using is not from Husky. Its a replica from China since the company can't exactly afford a $100K mold at this point in time.

We do have a technician, but he only trouble shoots the machine. He doesn't know much about the materials side of things.

So any help would be appreciated! Thank you!

Here is a Youtube Link to the process: https://youtu.be/enX9sZKz4Nc  (In the beginning, the preform isn't stuck but usually thats the position it gets stuck and it you need to manually eject it)

Since it can trickle charge, I'm viewing the generator to be kind of a 14Ah buffer for my other batteries. 

The next step is to start thinking about building an electric bicycle. I know its going to introduce quite a load to my solar system, and I also know that the AGM battery in the Yeti is NOT deep cycle. I estimate the cell would last only a year or two with daily deep cycling to charge an electric bike. 

**So here is my question:** 
*Assuming perfect solar conditions, would it be more cost-effective in the long run to go with either* 1) a second smaller battery dedicated to the bicycle and trickle charged from the genny alongside of my 28Ah Anker, or 2) replace my 14Ah buffer entirely with something like an 33Ah AGM car battery (see: sold-out Yeti 400), tie the bike directly to it, and not worry about deep-cycling so much unless I go long distance?

This is not your typical egg drop experiment. Here are the guidelines distrubited by the professor. In case anyone is worried permission was explicitly given to use any resources ie. online, friends, family given the difficulty of this project. 

Quoted from the rubric, ""You may consult the web and other sources for ideas. There is a lot of information available. But you will still have to decide how you will proceed.

In our challenge, our containers will be ""energetically tossed"" off a 12 ft roof onto a concrete floor. The container must hold 6 eggs, not 1. Now here's the hard part, it can't be larger than 125 cubic inches, (5"" x 5"" x 5"") or some variation to arrive at 125. This is about the size of a tissue box. No ""bought"" systems are allowed, neither are balloons. The issue with a parachute is that it may not deploy before the eggs hit the ground. Since the container has to be less than 125 cubic inches, we can't start with the parachute open. Common ideas such as the straw method won't work because they're too big.

98,How does your company handle vendor/supplier item approvals/certifications etc.,1473279479,"My company builds electrical equipment for hazardous areas (process instrumentation, gas analyzers) and our finished product is certified according to a number of standards by various agencies (CSA, ATEX, IECEx, CE mark etc.)

I am sure many of you work with products that are subject to any number of certification and/or regulatory considerations. **My question is: how does your company document this information as it applies to your component/part suppliers?**

For those who are not familiar with this need, a good example is compliance with the EU RoHS directive (reduction of hazardous substances). To summarize a very complicated activity, electrical equipment sold in the EU is regulated to ensure that it contains a certain maximum quantity of nasty chemicals like lead, mercury, etc. The components you put into your equipment must be RoHS-compliant so that you can then claim compliance for your finished product and affix the coveted ""CE"" marking.

With that said, h**ere's what the specification/procurement process looks like in our company:**

1. Engineer identifies need for electrical component
2. Engineer reviews vendor catalog and selects a part number
3. Engineer creates an internal control number in the ERP/MRP
4. Engineer produces a ""vendor item drawing"".
     - Sidebar: ASME-Y14.24 identifies a ""Vendor Item Control Drawing"" which looks like what you would imagine a drawing to look like. Dimensions, notes, title block etc. Vendor's part number is identified next to cage code or contact details etc. 
     - However: our VID is more like a cover sheet that has the vendor's info, part number, revision (a la title block). This is followed by the catalog cutsheet, and every page from every certificate available for the part (ATEX, IECEx, EAC, Lloyd's, etc.) the packet ends up being 2 or 3 dozen pages long.
5. The packet is approved by 4-5 people and purchasing is then allowed to go buy the part.

**I appreciate any insights provided! I apologize if this is confusing, and I will clarify and provide examples if needed, I don't want to scare people away with a massive wall of text needed to describe all aspects of the situation.**

Now I'm a bit worried that I won't be granted the interim. If I am not the company will recind the offer since there's no work for me to do without a clearance. 

I'm hoping you guys can shed some light on how likely I am to be granted the interim and whether I should be looking for a alternative position.

5,How is flow from a hydraulic pump distributed across a valve bank? Does a fully opened valve allow the full flow through?,1473261139,"##EDIT2: I've come to realize that I shouldn't have asked this in an engineering subreddit. The system I'm working on, it doesn't have to behave and simulate every component, nor does the value for the pressure and every inch matter. It's a dumby system, that's suppose to act as a power distributor, and that's pretty much it. 

I'm a software developer working on some new simulation systems for my company, and I've been tasked with modeling a hydraulic system, but am having trouble researching some formulas for this. I understand that a hydraulic pump generates flow-rate of a fluid, and how a valve works, and that pressure is a result of resistance to flow. 

But where I'm getting stumped is how to distribute the flow-rate from the pump across a valve bank, and how opening a single valve to fully open changes the pressure across the bank, as well as how it affects the flow rate. I'm suppose to keep it as simple as possible, while at the same time, model everything as individual components, so I'm looking for more of an abstract model in some ways, I think.


Some of the questions that I'm running into are:

* Does the output of a fully open valve, in a valve bank, have the same flow rate (assuming all other valves remain closed), as the input to the valve bank?
* If all valves in a bank are opened, is the output of each valve equal to the flow rate divided by the number of valves? 

I've come up with a theory that I should be able to calculate the net flow rate across all valves in the bank by compiling the normalized (percent) openness of each valve in the bank, and then distributing the value of the input flow accordingly (see my example bellow). Is this correct? 

**The formulas I developed for distribution across the bank, is as follows:**

* R represents the input flow-rate from the pump to the bank

* V represents the number of valves in the bank

* O(v) represents the normalized openness of an individual valve in the bank, where v is the valve number

* T representing the Total-Let-Through of the bank, which would be the combined openness of all valves

* &gt; T = [O(1) + O(2) + ... ]

* N represents the net distributed flow rate across the bank

* &gt; N = R / T

* F(v) represents the output of an individual valve in the bank, where v is the valve number

* &gt; F(v) = O(v) * N

* B Represents the total output of the bank

* &gt; B = [F(1) + F(2) + ...]

**If I have a bank of 5 valves, and a pump generating 100 GPM:**

* With all 5 valves fully open (100%, or 1): N = (100 GPM) / [1+1+1+1+1] = 100/5 = 20 GPM

* &gt; F(1) = O(1) * N = 1 * 20 GPM = 20 GPM
* &gt; F(2) = O(2) * N = 1 * 20 GPM = 20 GPM
* &gt; F(3) = O(3) * N = 1 * 20 GPM = 20 GPM
* &gt; F(4) = O(4) * N = 1 * 20 GPM = 20 GPM
* &gt; F(5) = O(5) * N = 1 * 20 GPM = 20 GPM
* &gt;&gt; B = 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 100 GPM
* With only 1 valves open, and 4 valves closed: N = (100 GPM) / [1+0+0+0+0] = 100/1 = 100 GPM

* &gt; F(1) = O(1) * N = 1 * 100 GPM = 100 GPM
* &gt; F(2) = O(2) * N = 0 * 100 GPM = 000 GPM
* &gt; F(3) = O(3) * N = 0 * 100 GPM = 000 GPM
* &gt; F(4) = O(4) * N = 0 * 100 GPM = 000 GPM
* &gt; F(5) = O(5) * N = 0 * 100 GPM = 000 GPM
* &gt;&gt; B = 100 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 100 GPM
* And in a more complex situation where the valves were all opened randomly: N = (100 GPM)/[1+0.5+0+0.25+0.75] = 100/2.5 = 40 GPM

* &gt; F(1) = O(1) * N = 1.00 * 40 GPM = 40 GPM
* &gt; F(2) = O(2) * N = 0.50 * 40 GPM = 20 GPM
* &gt; F(3) = O(3) * N = 0.00 * 40 GPM = 00 GPM
* &gt; F(4) = O(4) * N = 0.25 * 40 GPM = 10 GPM
* &gt; F(5) = O(5) * N = 0.75 * 40 GPM = 30 GPM
* &gt;&gt; B = 40 + 20 + 0 + 10 + 30 = 100 GPM


But of course this system is flawed in that, with a single valve open half way (50% or 0.5), my formulas would say that N = 200 GPM and F(1) = 100 GPM. But realistically, N would be 50 GPM and F(1) should equal 50 GPM, right?


###EDIT: I should've know to be more clear, especially when asking engineers haha. This system that I'm building, it doesn't have to be exact, or even realistic for the most part. It's a used in the background to transmit power. You can assume ideal conditions for everything, 100% efficiency, etc. I know my theory is completely off base for any actual hydraulic simulation, and that I'm ignoring a lot of variables. A different question I now have is if this is ""good enough"" for a dumbed down, simple, abstract, loose, design where nothing changes but the input flow rate and the position of the valves. The system is unaware of where the output goes once it leaves the valve bank, and doesn't care. ",AskEngineers,Destects,/r/AskEngineers/comments/51lqew/how_is_flow_from_a_hydraulic_pump_distributed/

But I want to give it a try and really hope to have some comments or inputs from anyone who read this.
&amp;nbsp;

I have couple degrees, bachelor in Environmental Engineering, masters in Environmental Science and Chinese Translation &amp; Interpreting and PhD in Environmental Engineering. I am Chinese and had my degrees in China (top-tier universities) and Australia (2nd master's and PhD at University of Queensland). I live in a small town in Michigan with my husband and his family, which is about 4-5 hours drive north of Detroit. I am not a US citizen but have green card, thus I don't need to have any visa sponsorship. However, I cannot apply most of the work related to US government because those jobs require me to have a security clearance. 
&amp;nbsp;

As for my work experience, I worked for UNEP and universities for environmental projects in Thailand and China; but that was before I did my second master and PhD. I tutored statistical analysis, hydraulics and hydrology courses at university; I worked part-time as an interpreter (Chinese-English) for training courses at universities; I did field work, lab work, programming, etc.
&amp;nbsp;

At fist, I thought with my degrees and some work experience (projects related to UNEP, field work, teaching, etc.), finding a job in the US would not be too difficult. My husband and I are willing to relocate so I applied for jobs at almost every state in the US. I didn't ask for a high pay, $50,000 a year sounds good enough for me. I can even negotiate for lower if the living expenses in the areas are not too high. Due to the lack of industry experience, I applied for mostly entry-level or junior level positions, mostly in environmental consulting firms. However, the reality is that I am at my 140 job applications now, only 3 interviews (face-to-face) yet no offers so far.  
&amp;nbsp;

From all the interviews I got, the hiring companies/personnel actually never looked up where I lived. All of them thought I lived in a big city and assumed it would take me 1 or 2 hours drive to get the interview places. They all seemed surprised to find out where I actually live. That gave me the impression that employers normally look for hiring people locally. From my job seeking experience and talking with other people, location seems to be the problem that I couldn't land a job. So I am thinking to take the risk of moving out of remote Michigan area and go live in the area with work.
&amp;nbsp;

My husband and I love Colorado and we are seriously thinking to move to Denver to look for work. We don't have much saving but he can take jobs like substitute teaching and I can do online translation work and even go work as a waitress in a restaurant. Ideally, I still want to get into the environmental consultant industry to work on something that I can use my skills. I am taking online courses to learn more about US environmental laws and programming language like R, Python, SQL, etc. (I am strong in Matlab but it doesn't seem to me that it is a popular program in the industry.) 
&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I have done everything I could with my very limited network in the US. I tried to connect with people on LinkedIn (quite awkward experience for me); I contacted with everyone I know working as an engineer and asked for advises. It seems to me that the only thing I could do to improve my chance of getting hired is to move without a job offer; if I get a job, I have to move anyway, so why not earlier? 
&amp;nbsp;

Sorry that my story is not an uplifting one for job seekers. I still want to try everything I can. For anyone who happens to be an environmental engineer/water engineer/scientist in Denver area or knows someone working in the field, is Denver a good place for my husband and I to move to?

17,Should I Install a Vacuum Breaker on my Sump Pump's Dry Well,1473209268,"I recently bought a house, the previous owner had jack hammered a hole through the concrete floor and dug about 12"" down and plopped a sump pump down there. 

My house has low level radon problems slightly above then EPA guidelines, so my first project was sealing up the gaping hole in the basement floor and retesting radon levels.

I bought a 20 gallon drywell from Jackal and drilled 912 0.375"" diameter holes into the drywell for water to seep through. I dug the hole in the basement floor to about 28"" deep and put a 6"" barrier of 3/4"" river stones around the basin. Finally I poured concrete around the perimeter making everything flush with the finished floor.

My dry well came with a cover that seals to the basin. I don't anticipate my pump running often, perhaps a few times in the spring when the snow melts off. I have the pump's discharge line sealed around an opening in the sump cover, and another 2"" opening that i could seal solid or add a vacuum breaker to. 

Is the vac breaker really required for this- I don't see any harm in adding it, just wondering if it would actually make a noticeable different in the pump's output when it does run.

If I were to add a low pressure vacuum fan to mitigate radon in the house (assuming radon levels are elevated after retesting), I would see the vac breaker as prohibitive, as it would allow the concrete floor to ""breathe"" so to speak.",AskEngineers,masshole4life23,/r/AskEngineers/comments/51ijk3/should_i_install_a_vacuum_breaker_on_my_sump/

21,How does a processor physically communicate accurate bit instructions to the monitor,1473202081,"I get that bits are stored by voltage levels or held charges (speaking of capacitors, although my verbiage may be wrong). But how does a sequence of bits travel accurately across the bus to the monitor (or GPU, I think the bits go here first before arriving at the monitor to display anything).

Knowing that bits are just an abstract way to work with voltage, how are they physically communicated without error? Do the electrons flowing through a cable (the bus) move in some kind of charged order? A 1 is sent as a charged electron and a 0 is a traveling hole?

/r/tructohs gave me a good start [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askengineering/comments/51ay3d/how_does_a_processor_communicate_instructions_to/) - does this mean the wire is what communicates the bit sequence?  Kind of like Morse code; the output devices alternates the voltage across the wire and the holes flow continuously, but the alternating voltage sends the bit sequence?  I'm guessing there's some kind of parity voltage in case a 1 is followed by a 1 and vice versa.

I have a weird concrete lifting problem that has several concrete contractors puzzled, and I was wondering if a materials/civil/mechanical engineer (or really anyone) could help me figure it out.

I have a driveway outside of my house and a sidewalk cutting across it:

http://i.imgur.com/jeVEIVT.png

At the expansion joint in the sidewalk (vertical red line above), the concrete on one side of the sidewalk is lifting up. However, this only happens during the day when it gets really hot outside, and the height of one slab above the other can reach 2"" on hot days (like today). At night, the concrete returns to normal:

http://i.imgur.com/s8avtet.png

I bought the house this year, and the neighbors say this has definitely not happened in previous years. The house and sidewalk are about 8 years old.

Two concrete contractors have looked at it and both have been puzzled, saying they've never seen concrete behave like that, and I also asked on /r/HomeImprovement where someone recommended I ask here. One concrete contractor thought I should just mudjack everything else up to the highest point, and another one thought that wouldn't be a good solution and I'd probably just have to rip and repour. 

My own theory about this is that maybe the sidewalk segment that is lifting was done in two different pours with two different types of concrete, and in the heat the slab is acting like a bimetallic strip and warping due to different coefficients of thermal expansion.

Does anyone have any ideas about this? Having just bought the house I'd prefer not to have to also get slammed with the expense of replacing a sidewalk...",AskEngineers,chui101,/r/AskEngineers/comments/51gwm8/weird_concrete_sidewalk_lifting_problem/

I'm an MSE major who's just graduated with an MSc. in Nanotechnology (as in just this week.) My thesis was mainly on the chemical vapor deposition of graphene although I also did a bit of ab inito modeling using a software package called ""Quantum Espresso.""

I've been accepted to a PhD at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) with a group that's working on perovskite solar cells, effective January 2017. I'll probably be working on creating the graphene electrodes for these solar cells. Were I to accept, I'd be starting this PhD at 25 years of age and would likely finish in my early 30s.

Although the group I'm working with is well-connected with both industry and academia and the financial package I'd be receiving at OIST would be very comfortable, by PhD standards, the prospect of being a fresh graduate with no ""real"" work experience at 30  is very daunting.

My end goal is to transition into a corporate R&amp;D role with a comfortable salary of USD 100~150K which challenges and engages my intellect and curiosity.

That said, I'm having misgivings about doing the PhD altogether if corporate R&amp;D is my end-game- I'm receiving mixed messages from peers and superiors inside and outside of academia to do/not do the PhD at all and jump straight into industry, or to concede and pursue an industrial PhD alongside R&amp;D work instead of pouring another 5 years into an academic PhD.

Nearly 3-4 hours later, it goes Off AGAIN. This time they come the number is 37, and someone from PSE&amp;G comes to inspect the oven. Here's where im confused, basically the guy from PSE&amp;G had told us that we breathe in carbon monoxide and that when making coffee/ using the oven it is normal  for the number to go up to 40. Is this true?  Additionally he said that spilled gasoline can cause carbon monoxide detectors to go off, and that my detector was unreliable , which doesn't make sense since we replaced the batteries yesterday and the device itself is only 2 years old ( the firemen also confirmed the carbon monoxide as I said earlier with their machines ). Last night me and someone else were feeling very light headed ( even though we hadn't told the firemen ), and for the past could days people in my house have been feeling like this as well . Also, 2 days ago the carbon monoxide detectors went off around the same time but we did not call the fire department; but it didn't last as long. Basically I want to know if what the man said is true, the most confusing part was when he had told me we breathe in carbon monoxide.

I was hoping that someone could advise on the most basic Pneumatic setup I could put together for a few prototype systems that I'm building at work (I'm mostly a software engineer so my hardware is a little less strong and I'd like to seek some advice) 

&amp;nbsp; 

I've been doing my reading, searching and I've found a few sources that say all that I need is: A air pump, a valve, some cables and a cylinder

&amp;nbsp; 

Is this really all that I need to construct a basic circuit? Also am I correct in understanding that the pump is constantly powered and the valve can be activated by High and Lows from a micro-controller?  

I was hoping something that looks like [this image](http://www.x-sim.de/manual/synscreen6.gif) would be perfect?

My other concern is: how is best to linearly and uniformly raise and lift 4 separate actuators, is pneumatic pressure good enough that I could use a 4 way split and each would move the same? (My aim is to lift a tray of plants so can't have any tilt that would drop the plants)

62,How to double-shield a cable properly?,1473037675,"I have a shielded cable, but the shield is not very efficient because the EM radiation leaked from the cable still interferes with nearby equipment. It is still better than a no shielded counterpart, but still not efficient.

So I am thinking of putting another shield around the cable.The cable is insulated already with a rubber coat at the outside.

I am thinking of wrapping aluminium tape around the rubber coat, all the way from one end to the other end. The cable ends with a metalic connector back-shell.

**Would this method decrease the amount of EM radiation from the cable?**

I have also read that it's better to keep the insulation layer on, and put the 2nd layer of the shield over the insulation, so there is always a layer of insulation between the 2 shields.

I have read on other forums that the outer shield has to be bonded 360 degree to the back-shell, on both sides, tightly. While the inner shield has to be connected inside to the backshell.

**Does this mean that all shields have to be connected to the backshell, and the outermost shield has to be wrapped all around it in 360 degree?**

Also is it more efficient to leave a layer of insulation between shields, than to have all shield layers next to one another. Some forums say it's more efficient to have a layer of insulation like air, plastic or the rubber between the shields so that the shield has better reflectivity.

I have drawn an illustration how my cable would look like:

[cable.png](https://postimg.org/image/hn04wukuz/)

**So to recap:** currently it has 1 shield and 2 insulation layers protecting the signal wire and the outside. After I'm done I would all another shield around the outside rubber coating, and 1 more insulation layer around the shield. The outside shield would be bonded to the back-end connector, that is metalic.The metalic backend connector is connecting to a chassis, that is grounded properly.

67,"Looking to build my own load-cell, how does the Sparkfun Load Cell Amplifier preform?",1473022648,"For part of a robotics project I am using strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge to turn part of my structure into a transducer in order to measure the forces going through my system. I was originally planning on designing and building my own circuit to both provide a constant voltage reference to the Wheatstone bridge and to both buffer and amplify the output of the Wheatstone. The final output will be sent to a analog to digital convert of some sort and power will be provided from the robot. The robot runs on a 48V DC system from lithium ion batteries. The 48V is used to power 4 powerful brush less motors. Its converted to 12V to run some of the electronics, sensors, and smaller motors. I was worried about both stability of the voltage from the battery and from the 12V converter. From what I understand, if I want my transducer to be precise, I need to have a constant and stable voltage across my Wheatstone. 

Now, I am a mechanical engineer so my knowledge of electronics is limited. When I talked to the controls team I am working with on the project they recommended to use a Sparkfun Load Cell amplifier. This little $10 board appears to do everything that I need. It has a voltage regulator, an amplifier circuit, and an analog to digital converter. My concern is that it's cheap. And in my experience, cheap equates to poor performance. Some of the strain gauge signal conditioners I was looking at cost over $200. And I had a conversation with a professor at my local university and he recommended that I simply build my own circuit. The end goal is to use the strain gauges to measure a force and for them to be isolate from thermal expansion. I believe my mechanical design meets these criteria and I'm worried about the electrical side.  

So the question I ask is, How will the sparkfun load cell amplifier preform? How will it compare to a $200 strain gauge signal conditioner or custom built circuit? Will it be able to provide a stable voltage when powered by a lithium ion battery? Or will I need to be a voltage regulator circuit?

80,Is it possible to launch something into space with a parachute?,1472974115,"I thought I came up with a novel idea of launching a payload into space without the baggage of a giant rocket and was wondering if somebody could do a sanity check...

You would attach a payload with a quick release onto a long tether (tens if not hundreds km long) with a large parachute in the middle and a winch at a ground station.

Deploy the parachute in the upper atmosphere one way or another, fire up that winch and suddenly you have your payload on it's way into space without all that rocket fuel.

The tether/chute could be made out of Dyneema and the tether could be hoisted up by drones along the way to fight gravity if need be.

Am I nuts for thinking this could work?

Edit - 

My back of the envelope calculations seemed to indicate that the parachute won't have a problem generating 'lift' since the air surrounding it is more or less static relative to a chute if the winch can put enough energy into the payload fast enough. The weak point would be the tether which would snap if pulled too fast.

89,Mechatronics Engineers:What do you do day to day? is it worth getting a Master's degree in this field?,1472920854,"I'm studying mechanical engineering, but my favorite courses have been the electronics and controls courses that I've taken. It's too late to switch to EE now, but I was considering the possibility of going to grad school for Mechatronics Engineer (or EE, but that might be a bit more difficult switch). I know I could get into the field with just a bachelor's degree, but I feel like there's so much still to learn going into my senior year (plus I want to do it abroad, for the experience as well).

So MT engineers: what kind of things do you work on day to day? and is it worth getting a master's in this field, or do I risk being seen as a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" (or is that even applicable for a master's)?

93,Mechanical vs Electrical/Computer Engineering Outlook,1472902671,"Good Day Engineer Redditors, I would like to know what your view is on the job outlook regarding electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. I've seen anecdotes online that there are no shortage of electrical engineering jobs but some mechanical engineers have trouble finding jobs. I've also head that if one is willing to relocate, getting a job as a mechanical or electrical engineer is very easy.

According to the bureau of labor statistics, mechanical engineers have a projected job growth rate of 5% while electrical engineers are actually losing jobs. So according to official statistics electrical engineers are going to do badly, but I'm not sure how accurate this is.

The thing is, I've taken statics twice and got an F the first time and a C- the second time. The way it's set up is 90% exams, 10% homework and ever since high school, I've always been a terrible test taker.
