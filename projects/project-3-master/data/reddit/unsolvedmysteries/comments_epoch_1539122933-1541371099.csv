0,CO2 and Indoor Air Quality,1541369113,"I am an HVAC controls specialist in Wyoming and a facility manager (school district) recently challenged me by observing the normal CO2 PPM concentrations will be lower as altitude increases.

The CO2 sensors installed have a self-calibrating routine that tries to reset the low PPM reading to sea-level (400ish), but the altitude of the facility is above 7,000'.

From a controls stand point, I clearly measure a rise in CO2 during occupancy and ventilation sequences appear to control the readings.

The managers questions were: 1) is CO2's toxicity derived from the raw concentration, or is it based on a ratio of the other ambient gases? 2) is a set point of 600 PPMs still adequate/appropriate with the self-recalibration routine at the sensors?

I believe the facility manager's goal is to reduce the amount of ventilation when it is sub-zero to save energy, but he sincerely doesn't want to jeopardize his student's and faculty's health.

I shot from the hip and explained that the mechanical engineer's design would be in accordance with ASHRE, but I wonder a little myself.

I've recently been reading up on flight stability and control for a recent lab session I've had at university. One of the main aspects of this was short period oscillation of a fixed wing aircraft. I'm pretty sure I have the basics understood, but I am struggling to fully understand what is meant by the SPO behaviour of the aircraft... I'm looking at stable, unstable and neutral flight conditions, how does this relate to these condidtions? It is simply just the time it takes in each condition for the aircraft to return to level and steady flight, or am I missing fundemental concepts here? I've even read up on the regulations that reguire aircraft to be heavy damped, and while what has been stated is easily understood, I'm still not sure on how heavily damped is defined...

11,I am missing a calculation step in my pressure sensor calibration. Could you please tell me what I am missing?,1541322366,"Hello folks,

I was hoping someone of you might be able to help me with this issue, there's actually only one step of calculation left to do. I want to calibrate pressure sensors measuring pressure difference with a Voltage output of 0,5 to 4,5 Volt and a pressure range of -1 bar to 12,8 bar (pressure difference). The values have been viewed on an Ecograph. The Voltage range has been set to 0 to 5 Volt (no other option did fit better) and the pressure range has been set to -1 to 12,8 bar.

I did the calibration by setting the sensor under defined pressures and compared those to the pressures shown by the Ecograph. These are the values I measured:

p theoretical p measured

1 1,28998462

2 2,00308889

3 2,87799

4 3,77128571

5 4,63634286

6 5,52046923

7 6,398375

8 7,1308

I calculated the actual pressure that stands for the voltage put out by the pressure sensor by this calculation:

y = ax + b, a = (12,8-(-1))/(4,5-0,5) = 3,45 b = -1-(0,5a) = -1-(0,5*3,45) = -2,725

According to this linear function, the actual pressure measured by the sensor corresponding to a defined voltage can be calculated like this:

p = (U*3,45)-2,725

With this, you get the following values:

U p

0,0 -2,725

0,5 -1,000

1,0 0,725

1,5 2,450

2,0 4,175

2,5 5,900

3,0 7,625

3,5 9,350

4,0 11,075

4,5 12,800

5,0 14,525

So I saw that the Ecograph would show the right pressure values if i changed the pressure range to -2,725 to 14,525.

But I would like to recalculate the existing values to match the theoretical pressure values.

For this, I would first need the voltage put out by the sensor when they measure the pressures I got out of them.

Since I chose different settings on the Ecograph than the pressure sensor delivers, I did the same what I did about the sensor:

y = a*x + b,

a = (12,8-(-1))/(5-0) = 2,76

b = -1-(0a) = -1-(02,76) = -1

With this, I also got a set of values for the Ecograph:

U p

0,0 -1,00

0,5 0,38

1,0 1,76

1,5 3,14

2,0 4,52

2,5 5,90

3,0 7,28

3,5 8,66

4,0 10,04

4,5 11,42

5,0 12,80

Now I am not sure how to go on from now. I tried to calculate the voltage standing for the measured pressure values with this formula:

U = (p (measured)+1)/2,76

How can I recalculate my off values to match the theoretical pressures?

p theoretical p measured

1 1,28998462

2 2,00308889

6 5,52046923

7 6,398375

21,Am I making the right decision?,1541298208,"Just for background, I am an EE student at the University of Alberta in Canada. I'm currently on my third year and I think I'm burnt out.


This week, I had 3 straight days of midterms and I missed one of them (embedded systems class) because I couldn't get myself to study. I have 6 classes this semester, 5 of those are engineering classes (3 of which have labs), and 1 is an elective. I knew this semester was gonna be rough so I started studying early (2 weeks before the semester started) so I don't fall behind in classes during the semester. However, the workload still caught up to me. I've been doing well in all of my classes so far, except for my embedded systems class. I don't have any experience in embedded systems so it's taking me a little bit longer to understand concepts in lecture and do things in the lab because everything is new to me. It doesn't help that my lab partner does almost nothing so I had to do most of the work in the lab by myself. For the first lab project, I had to do most of the work myself and it was alright because the project wasn't too difficult and some of my friends helped me out. However, the second lab project was a lot more difficult that even the lab instructors realized this and decided to extend the lab demo by a week. I easily spent 30+ hours on it while my lab partner kept making excuses on why he can't meet up with me so I had to do the project by myself again. On the bright side, I learned so much from that second lab project but it actually took so much of my time that I could've used to study for my other classes. I couldn't just say fuck it I'll take whatever grade I can get and just do well on the next lab because for each lab project, we have to use our working circuit from the previous lab. So, anyway, this past week, I had 3 midterms: Electronic devices (Wed), Embedded systems (Thurs), and Power systems (Friday). I was a bit prepared for my Wednesday and Friday midterms because I have been doing well on assignments and I already understood the concepts so my plan was to do practice exams the night before each midterm. But, for my embedded systems midterm, I wasn't prepared at all. I haven't studied some of the concepts yet that was gonna be on the midterm but I thought I'll just study right after my Wednesday midterm. But, what happened was, after my Wednesday midterm, when I got home I was so tired and my brain was drained after that exam so I took a nap for 2 hours first but after I woke up, I still couldn't study. For a few hours, I tried reading my notes, watched videos and googled stuff but nothing is going into my head. I panicked a little bit but I thought maybe I should just sleep (it was 9pm at the time) and wake up early around 4 am and study when I'm rested and have a clear mind. But, I was so stressed out that I couldn't sleep. I was still up at 4 am even though I have been in bed since 10 pm. I couldn't stop thinking of all the things I have to do. The embedded systems midterm was already stressing me out, and then I have another midterm the day after that, then on Monday I have 2 assignments due and a lab report due on Tuesday, 2 assignments due and lab demo for my embedded systems class for lab project #3 (which I haven't even started yet) on Thursday, and midterm for my elective on Friday. 


Anyways, when I still couldn't sleep at 4 am, I decided I'll skip the midterm and just drop my embedded systems class and extend my degree by a year (this class is a pre-requisite for the capstone class in my final year and it is only offered once a year). So, I got out of bed, went on my laptop and started planning out all the remaining classes I have to take. The problem is, because I took 3 classes in the summer to lighten my course load for my last 2 years (which is now going to be 3 years), that means next semester I will only have 4 classes, and on my 4th &amp; 5th year I will have only 3 classes each semester. I feel like this will look really bad for any potential employer when they see my transcript and find that I only had 3 classes each semester for my last 2 years. Am I making the right decision here? I haven't dropped my embedded systems class yet, I'm still thinking maybe I can still pass it because the midterm I missed was worth only 20% of the final mark but definitely won't have a good grade anymore. So I don't know.

When I say ""design"", I mean building application circuits or integrating preexisting products. More specifically, I enjoy working with artists and audio. I do a lot of self development projects in line with this on my own time.

I am getting a lot of interviews for hardware development jobs in fields I don't really care about at all. Namely, automotive - doing hardware upbring for telemetatics (IoT, CAN, etc). I recently abandoned a few of my own personal audio projects to get some more experience with CAN networks (due to the nature of the jobs that I have interviews for)... and it's pretty miserable stuff. I feel terrible to stop working on the automotive development projects because I really need money and a job (ie. why I am further developing these ""desirable"" skills), but this work is a huge drag.

On the flip side, I am getting a handful of interviews for Technical Sales roles, and I think I would be good at this sort of job. However, the companies I would be working for are also not in the field of AV and multimedia. I really would not want my engineering skills to go to the wayside, but I also do not want to build an engineering skill set that I have no interest in.

60,What does it means to be an engineer?,1541174206,"Hi everyone,

 

First of, I want to give a little background for context to the email exchange that I had between me and my senior colleague. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got hired as a PLC Programmer in the beginning of the year. When I arrived at my new job, they told me that there wouldn't be any mentorship and that I would have to figure everything out myself. Prior to this job, I have never heard of the term PLC before but I wanted to learn so I was determined to understand control engineering. As I got assigned more projects and more projects, they gradually pushed me towards learning electrical engineering. Once again another subject that I have no background in as my degree was in computer science. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent hours, weeks, and months confused and frustrated on how to approach issues, wiring components, development concepts because there was no one explaining anything to me. But nonetheless I move forward with my project and it's close to deploying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, since we're done with the first phase, I am have to start the process of deploying my system which means purchasing enclosures, panels, and accessories to the panels for the installation despite never been taught on the standards of deployment or even given the measurements of the materials. It wasn't even originality my responsibilities and it was pushed upon me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was discussing with my senior colleague K. I told K that we can't hijack the analog current signal on the  current system. K told me that senior colleague E was using a device in the field that can duplicate the analog current at 4-20mA and suggested that I ask E for the equipment info. So I sent E an email with the verbiage below -

&amp;#x200B;

""*I am trying to install the Mitsubishi setup at Paalaa Kai. Since we*   
*can't use the Analog Input current in parallel from the Barrington to*   
*the PLC, K suggested that I use an Analog splitter/ duplicator and K*  
*mentioned that you guys used them in the field. Can I ask what is the*   
*analog splitter/ duplicator that you guys are using (model &amp; serial)?*  


*Thank you*""

&amp;#x200B;

and this was E's reply - 

&amp;#x200B;

""*As an aspiring engineer, you should be able to find these components, look at the spec sheet, and figure out if it will work.  Sure I could give you the answer, but you will have learned nothing from the exercise.  If you are planning on becoming an electrical engineer as you have stated before, searching for components that fit your needs is a miniscule part of what is expected.  Long story short, Google will show you the way.*  


*Regards,*""

&amp;#x200B;

I could understand if he was busy or I was asking too many questions. But this was the first question that I had email him and the first interaction I've ever had in months with him. I felt that this is a total regard of my effort because I didn't even ask him to help me wiring it up because I already know he wouldn't but rather I just asked him for the serial model and number. My intention was to see if it was still in stock and use it at my project site. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I was doing an ethical thing and trying to appeal to my seniors with my effort and my determination but this makes me really think about what type of people they're trying to promote at this workplace. The Senior colleague E also cc'd our direct supervisor in his response. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have done 95% of the technicality of the project require and I can't even ask for a single model number/ serial from my senior colleague. I just want to ask the engineers of the reddit is that what being engineer about? Do you also sit alone in your office reading books and wondering if you're doing anything correctly according to the vague instruction that your supervisor give you? Am I overreacting about this?

Anyway,  I have a contract to hire offer presented to me that I will make almost  40K more a year but it requires me to move and I have been told by a  trusted source if a company is not providing benefits (aka - health  insurance) then its a good indication that its really just a contract  job and they are not trying to invest in me as a lasting employee.  I  tend to trust his opinion.

Side note - my  wife is very reticent to move and I am so depressed and disgusted with  my current employer because I don't want to leave - but I KNOW the value  I bring to the team and I KNOW there is no justifiable reason to not  pay me more.

They expect me to take this time off of school so I can devote my entire life to working there the next 7 months. I was also offered to start working there part time, from November to early January, before going full time since they could use help on another project they are understaffed for.

31,[Electrical] Residential power voltage abruptly jumps during peak periods,1541039610,"For the power EEs out there:

For the past few days, I've noticed that the electrical voltage where I live (120v nominal) is jumping abruptly near peak usage periods. Normal receptacle voltage here is around 117v, but just before the AM and PM usage peaks there's a transient disruption and the voltage jumps to around 125v. After the usage peak ends there's another transient and the voltage drops back down to around 117v. The voltage change is large enough that old-style incandescent and halogen lights get noticeably brighter (which is why I got a volt meter out to see what was happening in the first place) and the transient is long enough for fluorescent lights to flicker.

Both 120v legs stay within 1v at all times so I believe I have ruled out an open neutral.

I presume what's happening is that a tap changer is being a little too aggressive and is making too big of an adjustment in response to changing load conditions on the grid.

I just started working as a Mechanical Engineer (entry level) in a mechanical design firm.

I sent a set of compiled CAD drawings of parts to my manager to ask for feedback to see if I was on tne right track. I wanted to make a good impression so I worked extra hard and surprised them with my speed. However I make a small spelling error in a note in the drawing and my manager pointed it out (he's a cool and understanding guy). I should have spotted the error but I didn't, no excuse.. Sometimes familiar words with a small spelling variation gets glossed over.

73,Thinking of changing careers but I want to make sure it's not the same as where I just came from...,1540990025,"Hello,  


Yes, yet another career-changing thread! I've read through a lot of the other career posts on this sub, but my background is very abstract so would love some input.  


In short, I'm one of those people who's found themselves in that cycle of getting a job, love it for a few months, start to dislike it, start to hate it, quit, repeat. To be clear, I don't like this. I *want* to find a career that I love and be satisfied with. I have no problem with working hard (we'll get to that in a bit), but I have a problem with jumping through hoops and hard work for the sake of hard work. I'm trying to focus inwards to find what I really love and enjoy and work from there and the biggest theme seems to be 'making stuff'.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27, graduated in 2012 with a BA in music composition (I can already hear your groans) and before you think this was some aimless attempt at picking a major, I was dead-set on being a musician going into college and getting out of college I busted my tail to make a decent living as a musician and commercial composer.

&amp;#x200B;

To cut a long story short, the lifestyle of a musician is what really drove me out. You also hit a salary ceiling pretty quickly - I was one of those strange few that was able to make a living, but there is no company health insurance or annual pay increase within the music world. I had to think long and hard about my future and what music meant to me. I highly recommend watching a documentary called The Wrecking Crew (it was on Netflix the last time I checked) to get at what I'm trying to say, [this very short clip for GE Smith (longtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqqbARxsOOM)[ guitarist for SnL) is also a good insight to how it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqqbARxsOOM).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now. I've been head a creative department for a media company and now work in graphic design for a branding agency. It's definitely better, but it's still giving me a lot of headaches. I've tried to remove a lot of the variables: getting my own clients, taking on very creative work, taking on very corporate work etc... and coming to the conclusion that I *hate* working with clients and graphic design isn't all it's cracked up to be. I like creating visuals but just not so much for other people.

&amp;#x200B;

So, some more soul searching and trying to return to my roots. As a kid, I loved science and maths. I would fixate on anything to do with space, tech, and making. Taking this as a vague compass I joined a local maker space and have been tinkering away on some small projects. One of which is making fully functional, portable sonar for my nephew's cardboard submarine. The project is modest and still not fully completed but I've had more fun throwing myself at this than just about anything else I've ever done! I assembled all of the electronics from scratch, coded it out myself and am currently designing the casing and chassis via 3D printing. This got me thinking about my next steps and where I'd love y'all's input.

&amp;#x200B;

Engineer is sold as, let's call it 'intellectual making' - leveraging the most advanced maths and physics to make the world a better place through inventions and products. Now that sounds awesome and something that I want to do, but is engineer all it's cracked up to be? Is it really like that? Is it a reality of being stuck in a cubicle working on spreadsheets? I'm ok with budget dictating a job, but do clients dictate projects in a similar fashion to creative jobs (liking having to change literally everything after months of work because a client's wife likes the color green instead of red. I can't imagine you're forced to use rubber instead of steel on an aircraft because someone's partner likes how it looks, right?). Is it creative and curious? How bureaucratic is it?

I'm also looking into industrial design as this seems to align with a lot of my interests and may be all of the things I think engineering is but will less of the bureaucracy...? ID would also be a slightly easier profession for me to transition into as I've got a decent about of design and marketing experience.

&amp;#x200B;

One final point. I refuse to go back to school unless it's 100% necessary to what I *absolutely* want to do. One of my greatest strengths is that I'm a very strong autodidact and believe in showing what I can do through grit and determination vs throwing myself into colossal debt for a piece of paper and a career that I might not even want. It's a thousand times more educational, fun and cost-effective. This is where the hard work comes in. Really hard work, for a very good cause, is no problem to me. I'll do the thing, stay all night etc. But having to grid for the sake of having to grid (you have to do 'shitty job X' for at least 5 years before we let you do 'shitty job Y', for example) is something I can't stand - is the engineering community  accepting of that attitude or are there too many people on intellectual high horses (I've heard egos and arrogance can be common problems amongst engineers)? 

&amp;#x200B;

Congratulations for making it this far! I'd seriously appreciate people's input and thoughts. Feel free to ask questions.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to start collecting recycled plastic and turning it into useful, cheap, durable items that will help people. Eventually I'd like to even make some building materials to replace expensive (and low quality) cement, wood and galvanized steel and build affordable homes to replace the rusted-out shanties that people live in, if they are lucky. Eventually, if I have any success, I intend to open-source all of it to the world so that people can make their own versions in the rest of the developing world where poverty and garbage are huge problems as well.

Its a large project with many facets, but I'm simply here for some help on designing the oven which will melt the plastic in moulds and then I can compress it with other machines/presses. I figure the propane oven will be the best way to do this because electricity is both expensive and unreliable here. Someday a rocket mass heater with organic waste would be even better, but I want to make it work first. 

**Problem:**

I've found some forums for making powder coating ovens like this, but the people really just made a basic insulated box with a torpedo heater, and I'm looking to design a much more efficient system with a recirculating air system to allow for faster and more uniform heat transfer, and better energy efficiency. 

**Question:**

I'm not asking anyone to design me an oven, just looking to be pointed in a better direction. 

I've been reading about ""Process Heating"" and looking at the designs of various industrial process ovens, and it has been quite helpful. I'm just wondering if there is another field/keyword that I've overlooked that could open a new world of information to me. 

So, does anyone know of good resources - websites, magazines, forums, textbooks, etc... - that I can check out to read up on this? 

**Additional involvement:**

Again, I'm happy (and, I think, capable enough) to figure this out on my own. But if anyone is particularly knowledgeable about this and to put their expertise to a very meaningful cause, feel free to send me a PM as I'd really love any further support you can give me in answering questions regarding air/fuel mix, air flow, exhaust, combustion air preheating, insulation needs, pressure differentials, etc...

That being said, my coworker and I had a discussion yesterday and I am afraid that I may have been given some not-so-correct information regarding soft-start electric motors....

We have an older electric motor that we are looking to repurpose to a hydraulic pump power supply. In order to do this sufficiently, the motor has to be a soft-start motor. So, I went and took a picture of the data tag on the motor and was trying to look it up when my coworker walked in and asked what I was working on. I explained that I was trying to look up information on this electric motor to see the specs on it. He came over and looked at the data tag and said, ""There's all the information you need right there. (XX hp @ xxxxRPM...blah blah blah)"".

To which I responded by saying, ""OK, but is it soft-start capable?""

He looked at me kind of funny and stated, ""That's in the wiring...not the motor itself"" and went on to say, ""ALL motors are soft-start capable. It all depends on the wiring. You need to look at the control box to see if it will work or not.""

Based on what I can remember, a ""soft-start"" is a feathering of supplied voltage to the electric motor. This causes the motor to ramp up to speed (albeit very quickly) vs. instant-on speed.

However, again from what I can remember, feathering the voltage to an electric motor, that is not designed to be variable, can actually harm the motor itself and can cause premature failure or even catastrophic failure.

While I may be wrong in my understanding of how, specifically, a start-motor gets up to speed (feathering of voltage), I don't believe that ALL electric motors are soft-start capable.

1,Is it possible to switch careers to Engineering and pursue quality opportunities?,1540926261,"I am 25 years old and am not an Engineer. I am wondering not only if switching to being an engineer is possible, but would it even be possible for me to get good positions? 

I graduated from University in 2015 with a double major in International Business and Finance. When I initially looked at colleges in high school, I applied to a number of engineering programs and even got into a few highly ranked ones. At the time I was rather burned out from taking math every semester in high school with the only exception being my first semester Freshman year. Once I started college (in a business program), most of my friends were engineers and I started to miss it all within a year. I'd even hang out and watch them do homework just to try and pick up little pieces of knowledge here and there. Unfortunately at that point it wasn't financially realistic for me to switch my studies. 

I am currently working as a Project Manager. I've recently been applying to jobs and found I still find most of the engineering positions far more interesting. I've always thought there might be some way to transition back into it, even if it would be a  5+ year process. What worries me most is if I do make that transition that a ""late"" engineer or someone who didn't graduate with an engineering degree would be immediately overlooked for any competitive jobs. Is that a realistic concern? I've been self-studying programming for a while and think I could expand that into a long-term engineering plan but I don't know if the payoff would be worth it.

There was one suggestion that was intriguing - that mucus production decreases with less dust and gives the feeling of dryness. But  surely, mucus production wouldn't decrease so quickly (within a few hours of less dust). I agree - it doesn't make sense that water just disappears somewhere. Could it be that carbon dust emitted from the filter is giving the throat a dry feel, or that the filter simply doesn't work as well as it should and is blowing dust everywhere, causing a scratchy, dry feeling throat?

9,Plastic Tool and Die – Could either of these punch designs work?,1540916573,"My background is plastic extrusion tooling design and development. However punch sets are not my specialty and my experience has generally always been with simple punch operations consisting of holes or slots.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m currently looking at the feasibility of a somewhat odd punch application (at least from my experience) and looking for input on whether or not I should pursue either of the following designs.

&amp;nbsp;

I have 2 basic punch systems in albums linked below. Each album shows a simplified representation of the part to be punched as the first image. Part material is PVC or ABS with roughly .080” wall thickness and the cutout is roughly 3.00” square.

&amp;nbsp;

Keep in mind the below albums are extremely rough concepts with a lot of detail missing.  The punches and fixture I show are also designed to easily be cut by wire EDM.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel the design of album 2 is superior because of simplicity and lessened extraction problems, but I have never punched the edge of a part nor over an edge that contains an overhang of material so I feel a little unsure and would appreciate any input on the subject.

&amp;nbsp;

Album 1.  This design is intended to give better support to the part during the punch operation and have easily modified and sharpened blade design.  Drawbacks I see are slug extraction (cutting relief will be interesting especially in the overhung area). The remaining part would have to be removed as an extra step (possibly assisted by air pressure) and I also feel there could be issues with the blades not being as secure as I wish.

https://imgur.com/a/nqCQMxL

&amp;nbsp;

Album 2. This design is a more conventional solid punch and better part extraction.  Much less part support with this design (the entire reason for album 1), but I feel the general geometry of the punch itself should be able to shear the part well enough.

I want the shape of the core structure to be as close to the shape of Texas as possible.  At each 50' increment, there would be a small deck area or landing at 1 side of the wall.

To preface, I know building anything with carbon fiber and composite materials is a challenge especially if you don’t have a ton of experience but I’m up for the challenge and I see it as good experience even if the parts don’t come out quite right.

So my first question is for the moulds; what material should I use to to create the moulds and what should I make the blank out of?

However, since I’m using prepreg carbon to build the parts, I need to bake the parts in an oven and I’m not sure fiberglass would be the best for baking.

Second question; the parts I’m making are pretty much cones and cylinders so I will need the moulds to be 2 parts but I’m a little confused how to bond the two halves of the carbon after laying them in their respective moulds. I was thinking of having some backing carbon on the seam and then trying to kind of push that down with a dowel rod that reaches down the length of the tube but I fear that won’t make a solid enough connection between the halves.

45,Why can antennae be bent and twisted and still work?,1540853737,"I know a little E&amp;M, but this is far from my wheelhouse, so I was wondering if anyone can clear something up for me.

Often on little IC breakouts that work with wifi or radio, like [the ESP8266](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lrS8DBg9L._SX425_.jpg), I'll see what I assume is the antennae (gold, bottom left). That is it, right?

What I'm confused about is, how can it be all bent and twisted like that? My very basic conception of how an antenna works is that when an incident EM wave comes in, it pushes the charge carriers back and forth at the frequency of the light (and then it's amplified/etc). I also know there's stuff involving a ""cross section"" that determines how much light of a given frequency even interacts with the antenna, and I know the antenna has to be *roughly* the same size range as the wavelength (right?).

So I don't get why it's okay for it to be all bent and stuff. Wouldn't that cause electrons in the different ""layers"" of that snaking pattern to be accelerated in the same direction, but opposite directions with respect to the ""path"" of the antenna? that is, it seems to me like twisting it back and forth like this would cancel the effect. Like, it seems like if the EM wave gives rise to current at each location it hits, then these currents would be going in opposite directions and cancel each other.

I would like to do as much of the construction as possible myself. I have read of an interesting technique where Schedule 80 PVC pipe is driven into the bottom and filled with reinforced concrete.

I have heard that the pipe should be 8 inches, but also that it should be 12 inches.

Rebar should be used. Or hog wire.

The pipe can be jetted in using water injected down the inside of the pipe. Or driven by pounding on a collar.

The interior of the pipe should be emptied of mud with post hole diggers. Or will be mostly emptied as it’s jetted. Or the mud doesn’t matter.

56,How to deal with anger towards project manager?,1540837291,"Long story short: I've been on an industrial software project for about a year that started off really badly because the PM neglected documentation and design despite me and other team members telling him that we needed to give these parts of the project attention.  

This caused a very difficult 6 months since nothing was officially documented (except the code I wrote of course) but nothing about how the factory worked was written down or what exactly the code was supposed to do, it was all phone calls to machine operators and floor manager (there are over 10k I/O and many different machine sequences for making different parts).  

Anyway I had spoken to upper management early on but I don't think I was clear enough about the problem. I eventually gave up talking to them because they weren't doing anything.  

A few months ago they got involved when they finally realized how much of a clusterfuck things were and have mostly cleaned things up but I still harbor some anger and resentment towards the PM for doing such a bad job and ignoring his team's advice and even to upper management for failing to listen to us in the beginning and taking so long to fix them (though I am thankful that they eventually did intervene). I am generally happy with this company and upper management has been consistently good to us, though they are perhaps a little too trusting of their employees (In particular the PM who they told me was telling them, that everything was going fine.)

By, the way I got into IT in a finnish univeristy and I choose Environmental Engineerin a decision I will regret.
So, I always found it difficult to find work in that field and it is possibly the only thing I know about in this world. I got some of practical training and when I finished and talked to my boss why Is it difficult to find work, one big shocker was the fact that (THIS FIELD is not in demand and it is not needed!

One thing to note about me is that I love engineering, I always envy how they can design things, lead projects, they know how things work, they find solution to many things, they are good at math, physics, etc... They are very practical something that Environmental Engineering seems to lack. 

I read everywhere that Environmental Engineering is a great field, I studied physics, chemistry, biology, statistics, water and pollution, hydrology, microbiology, management(I can attach my courses if you demanded it). I noticed that for whatever, reason I still have absolutely no skills, am not good at anything. At high school(Univeristy of Cambridge supervized) I had done quite good in course B math, A physics, A biology, A chemisty, A advance subsidry, D advanced Math (Letter represent grades).

So the situation is that I recently had a glass pipe delivered.  Unfortunately a little bit of the styrofoam it was packed in got inside and now I'd like to get it out.  There's no way I'm going to get out through one of the holes so I was thinking I could dissolve it.  It looks like acetone will do the trick but i'm getting conflicting answers on Google as to the safety of that.

So my question is, if I submerge the pipe in acetone to dissolve it, what safety measures should I take to ensure it's safe to smoke completely legal herbs out of afterward?  Or is there another substance that would do the job more safely?  Or beyond that, does anyone have any other clever ways I may be able to get it out?

Choice of reactors in the lab are small-scale stainless steel Parr reactors, a mid-scale Hastelloy C-276 Parr reactor, and some pressure rated glassware that we could use instead.

Current gut feel is to run it all in the glassware during the screening phase (as a bonus it allows us to observe the reaction and use stirrer/hotplate for agitation), then once we move on to optimisation (i.e. we know catalyst choice, operating temp, reaction medium) we start to think more about materials for scale up.

I'd plug the inductive sensor and the stepper motor driver into an Arduino for reading the sensor output voltage and converting this signal to a movement on the stepper motor.

Basically if everything was working properly, I could hold a steel plate 10mm below the sensor and move it up and down and this would cause the whole slide to move up and down (powered by the stepper motor) to maintain a constant 10mm of clearance distance. It would be a feedback loop to keep the sensor always at 10mm. For example if the nominal 10mm of distance on the sensor was equivalent to 6V and the sensor was currently reading 5V then the arduino would tell the stepper motor to move up in order to reach the desired 6V aka 10mm.

Hi I could really do with some industry advice I'm a mechanical fitter from a petrochemical/power background in the UK. I've done lots of confined space entry work and always appreciated how seriously the H&amp;S was adhered to because everyone loves going home in one piece. Mainly it's the knowing you aren't at risk because someone cared enough to think about it.

I recently changed jobs to international field servicing but still for a UK based company and I keep seeing colleagues do things and being asked to help out in jobs that are throwing up massive red flags that would get me blacklisted from any reputable company if not sat in front of a HSE panel to explain myself.
We are given a lot of autonomy but I think it's going a bit far when the other week when the following happend:

we turned up to do a confined space entry for inspection and welding (argon gas from a tig set) 
I was just told to fly out so no tools or job prep just me and my basic ppe 
I arrive on site and our senior fitter has all the gear which is where the alarm bells start ringing. 

No gas sniffer for pre entry check 
Two personal gas monitors one of which wasn't even able to detect argon let alone oxygen levels 
The other one which was suitable was 7 months out of calibration 
I mention this to him and he gives me the ""job needs to be done so what are you going to do about it speech"" new to the company and in a non comah environment for the first time in my working life so I have no idea how firm I've got to be with him on this 

Single untested unlocked isolation valves holding back steam, not blanked off no valve passing test

Same with water and pneumatic 

No iso locks for main drive motors (entry space is a rotating tunnel with multiple compartments) 

The confined space was a nightmare, no way to drag my co worker to safety without snapping bits off him should the worst happen

Rescue plan was to call the fire brigade to come and cut us out (fairly sure the emergency services aren't allowed to be your rescue plan) 

Welding with an asphyxiant  heavier than air gas in a space with no airflow and multiple compartments 

The list could go on as multiple lapses of the absoloute basics I've always had drummed into me throughout my working life is growing by the day. 

I don't want to quit as I've always wanted the international job role and I love the technical difficulty of what I do but I've never been so aware of how unsafe I feel at work.

I can understand the paper , however my skills in matlab are very basic , i can write functions and execute it in the terminal. I had never worked on simulations. so please suggest me what are the modules i might need to learn to recreate these results in matlab.

Approach i believe is this 

* generate theta values from eq 15 , but then i have another problem the equation is of t(theta)not theta(t) so not sure how to generate values of theta with time values.
* using theta values and eq(13) i need to generate a Archimedes search trajectory.
* so to recreate the simulation i think i need to generate a graph(cartesian co-ordinate) (C-SPACE) with a rectangular figure which i will designate as ship and it moves at a certain speed.
* then using the equation given in paper i generate polar co-ordinate   which i will convert to cartesan co-ordinate then use that to generate the spiral i graph.

I understand power factor is due to the phase difference between the sinusoidal voltage wave and sinusoidal current wave. Are values of voltage and current on a motor nameplate related to the real or apparate power? If you measure the voltage across and current drawn by an induction motor in operation, are you measuring values related to the real or operate power?

I have been taking a review course at a local University once a week for three hours. I have slowly been studying the big Lindeburg book. 

The last few weeks I have really cranked it up, I even went and stayed with my mother this week so I can use my college's 24 hour library. I will have 48 hours in the library this week as of tomorrow afternoon. The last week I have been watching Gregory Michaelson's videos pausing and doing the problems I can complete and pressing play when I get jammed up. I then complete the questions in the Lindeburg Practice Problems book for the section I just watched. I have been using the FE Handbook for everything even if Michaelson mentions a formula i make sure to go find it myself. I will have completed every section by Tuesday. 

Saturday I will take the NCEES practice exam and spend the Sunday - Wednesday night reviewing my deficiencies and going over any sections I havent completed yet.

I don't have a lot of Mechanical Engineer friends and it's taboo to ask fellow employers.  Having never work at any other company, I can't tell if I'm underpaid or not.

Here's my brief details:

Salary: 94k + benefits.  15 days PTO.  Working 40hours a week.  Never have to work over time.

Title: Mechanical Design Engineer/Mechanical Engineer

Masters Degree in ME from UCLA in 2011.

7.5 years working for the same company straight out of college.   8yrs total work experience.

What I do:  I design custom tools for top of the line \*stuff\* (trying to be discrete here ).  The tools range from simple metal/plastic parts, large weldments, and carbon fiber assemblies.  I've been doing it for so long that it is pretty easy now.  I spend most of my time doing CAD work and utilize my creativity with my engineering background to design the best tool for the task.  Design work doesn't necessarily require a ME degree though, so where my ME background really comes to play is when analysis is necessary for the design task.  I'm able to tackle almost any ME related analysis problem.  All self-taught or through classes since my colleagues aren't ME majors.  I've done: gravity deflection, frequency analysis, stress analysis, thermal deformation, coating stress analysis, torque analysis, and simple hand calcs using free body stress diagrams and such.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I feel like I should be doing better financially.  I already asked for a raise but was told I needed to grow more.  I'm not sure how else to grow more when I already tackle every analysis problem they throw at me.  What do you guys think?  Am I really underpaid for my field or should I be happier where I currently am?  We just hired a Senior ME and I can tell I already have more knowledge and skill.

65,"Everyone says you shouldn't go biomedical engineering, what if its my only choice?",1540518754,"To start this off, I'm picky about where I want to go to school. I have dreamed my entire life of getting to go to School A which is out of state. I cannot afford out of state tuition however I do have the option to pick from two majors (Aerospace Engineering, Biomedical Engineering) that if I choose then I can attend for in-state rates since no school in my state offers them.

&amp;#x200B;

Both of those interest me, the latter more so do to the focus on several disciplines and my not knowing exactly what I want to do. I do have an interest in grad school (I am a first gen student and I am going to grad school at the very least to have the esteem that follows someone with a M.S. and in respect for my family who have worked to get me here) and I do know I want to work for an engineer for at least a few years. However, my ultimate goal is entrepreneurial. I love the medical field but I don't want to be a doctor, I am currently a bioinformatics research assistant and I have love every second of getting to develop things that help people. I'm sure you can see where this is going that I eventually would like to get into the medical start-up scene.

&amp;#x200B;

Is biomedical something I can make work? I am a very dedicated and hard worker, but I have read nightmares stories from students who were (as much as you can trust someone online) ""From top tier schools with top tier internships"" who claimed they couldn't get jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fine with aerospace to because the aerospace industry is soooo awesome I just feel for my entrepreneurial goals that would be very tough as any kind of aerospace venture will probably require a huge amount of capital and things such a security clearances.

73,Cubicles and focus: how does anyone get work done at work?,1540502200,"I'm an engineer at a large, multicultural corporation with low (4 foot) cube walls and giant entryways .

These small cubicles seem to give the illusion of solitude, and consequentially, people have no problems coughing, eating at their desk (mouth open, gums smacking) sneezing loudly, or yelling into the fucking phone. Engineers in general don't have a lot of social grace, and if you add in cultures that think nothing of throwing an audible fart, hocking loogies into the bathroom sink, or speaking at ridiculous volumes, it makes it impossible for me to focus and get work done efficiently. 

Add in constant interruptions and schedule pressure, and I find my self miserable on most days.

I have $300 noise cancelling headphones, but some co-workers can talk loudly enough to pierce them, and I get fatigue wearing them after a while. I occasionally telecommute or work from a conference room, but that gives the impression of not working or being availible. I've asked executive management for a 'focus room' with monitors and a laptop docking station, but was rebuffed.

I will admit that I am a little more sensitive to noise than most (misphonia maybe?) but if I ask co-workers, they quietly agree with me. Management loves the ""atmosphere of collaboration."" I feel stuck.

When travelling, I will try to find co-working spaces. I went to one called WorkBar in Boston, and they had specific ""no-phone"" zones and ""absolute quiet"" zones. When the worker is the customer, it's amazing how the office environment conforms to the need to fucking get shit done. When a VP or CEO reads an ridiculous article about how bean bags or no whiteboards increases projected productivity by 2%, they hop on board with no regard for people's happiness or actual productivity.

When I was in college and needed to work on a problem, I could go to the library and know that I wouldn't be bothered. When it is my job to work on a problem, management finds every way to interrupt me and still expect me to get my work done on a schedule that assumes I am uninterrupted.

What are your office environments like? Are there firms out there that value focus the way I do? Should I just suck it up?

I graduated with my Chemical Engineering B.S in 2016 with a 3.0 GPA. Since then, I've been doing web development right after college for about 2.5 years now. I enjoy programming and I used to program all day while in school and on the side, but I kind of regret getting into software development as a career because coding for a company is very, very different than programming as a hobby. I work for one of those ""Big 4"" software companies and I honestly hate the constant 70 hour weeks and all the bullshit that goes with it. My last job was, also, pretty terrible with hours as well. At this point, I just really want to keep programming as a hobby. Money isn't a factor to me. I am willing to take a 50% pay cut if I have to and can travel and be anywhere.

Anyways, this week I've been looking into applying to some process/manufacturing jobs ( or any non software related field) and I realized that I haven't really retained anything I've learned from school. I, also, don't really know how to tailor my resume where I'd be competitive for even an entry level job besides listing courses that I've taken in school. A lot of my extracurricular activities/internships while I was in college were all software related... Should I go back to school for a Masters?

9,Could Arthur C. Clarke's idea of having steam-powered satellites have actually worked?,1540417192,"Context:

In 1945, just a few months after the end of WWII and twelve years before the launch of Sputnik 1, a paper by [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke) was published in the Wireless World magazine. In it, Clarke proposed that geostationary satellites could be used for radio communication. 

But, the first practical silicon solar cell wouldn't be invented for another 9 years. So, in need of some sort of power source for the proposed satellites' radio transmitters, Clarke suggested that the satellites could use sunlight and large mirrors to heat up a volume of water in a glass enclosure which would in turn power a small steam engine. 

-

&gt;A second fundamental problem is the provision of electrical energy to run the large number of transmitters required for the different services. In space beyond the atmosphere, a square metre normal to the solar radiation intercepts 1.35 kW of energy. 6 Solar engines have already been devised for terrestrial use and are an economic proposition in tropical countries. They employ mirrors to concentrate sunlight on the boiler of a. low-pressure steam engine. Although this arrangement is not very efficient it could be made much more so in space where the operating components are in a vacuum, the radiation is intense and continuous, and the low-temperature end of the cycle could be not far from absolute zero. Thermo-electric and photoelectric developments may make it possible to utilise the solar energy more directly.

-

Could this have actually worked? How big would the [radiators](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/radiators.html) need to be to cool the water?

23,Engineering Major: Industrial vs Mechanical,1540401336,"Hi everyone,
I’m currently in college, and still at a point where it isn’t too hard to switch between majors. Right now, my major is mechanical engineering and if I continue this route, I plan on adding a engineering management minor because my goal is to get into the management side of things (and probably get an MBA down the road). Recently, I’ve learned about industrial engineering. It seems like it’d kind of jump start me into the management route (and possibly make it easier to go that route?). (Note: reason for possibly switching major isn’t because I’m worried about not being able to pass classes, but more-so worried about how I’ll be doing later in life)

I plan on ending up in the management/possibly business side of things (for all the wrong reasons $) even with a mechanical engineering degree. Although I’d be going the less technical route in the long run, I definitely find the technical side of engineering to be interesting, but am concerned as to how I’ll do later in life.

If you guys have any personal experience with careers in either degree or general knowledge/advice/insight that could help me out, that’d be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

* Can you order components like this directly from these Chinese manufacturers without having an import license? Again, the digging I've done has quickly become overwhelming. We're dealing with purchases of $500 - $700. I know no one can truly answer this question for our specific case, but I'm hoping someone who has dealt with this can point me in the right direction. 
* Do companies like DHL handle the import logistics like tariffs for you?

33,Revision descriptions vs. eco number on drawings,1540385128,"When revising drawings do you list revision descriptions on drawings? Or do you put ECO / ECR numbers on drawings and have user reference ECO for revision change notes? Or perhaps something else? 

&amp;#x200B;

We are implementing pdm and looking to streamline things. Currently we put revision descriptions on each drawing affected but I believe putting current ECO on drawing will be more efficient. The user wanting to know exactly what changed can then reference the ECO. We use the same parts in a lot of different assemblies, so if we are to add the ECO number on drawings we can automate revisions for assembly drawings rather than go through each assembly drawing and type description for what has changed. With ECO's we can also make sure revision descriptions are thorough and structured. Putting this information on a drawing often leads to very vague descriptions of what changed and reason why it changed.  

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of our parts are made overseas so I can see how the rev description is handy for them, but sometimes it takes weeks  and even months to update all of our assembly drawings (in the past they sometimes have never been updated...).

Currently I'm working on propulsion for my school's hyperloop team. We are using a cold gas thruster to propel our pod. This thruster is powered by a 3000 PSI tank of Nitrogen and will have a 3/4"" diameter thrust line. Our calculated exit velocity is about mach 2.5 while in the vacuum tube (\~14 torr).  


My question is, What is the best way to release the nitrogen down to the nozzle?   


Restrictions:  
\-We would like the opening time to be less than a second.  
\-Cannot use combustion.  
\-Probably shouldn't create shrapnel.  
\-As light as possible.  
\-Doesn't have to close after opening, but would be nice.   
\-Doesn't have to be reusable.  


So far through brainstorming and research we have come up with  
\-Rupture Valve that is punctured with pin (Could create shrapnel)  
\-Rupture Pin (Diverts flow to nozzle, reduces efficiency)  
\-Electric Actuated Valve  
\-Pneumatic Actuated Valve (Best option so far, can be powered from N2 tank)

I was recently moved to a more project oriented role and back filled with a new hire (NH). Fortunately, its a slow transition and I've had the last few months to train NH. They definitly started off very well for a new hire. NH worked well with technicians, put in the hours, and had an overall great work ethic. About a month in I realized NH was taking a little longer to learn some of the technical details of the role. Lately, I've had several people give me feedback around NH not understanding basic concepts they tried to explain. It is also taking 30-60 minutes to explain things that should take less than 10 minutes. I've expressed some concerns to NH's boss (my old boss) and they have similar issues when assigning NH small projects.

I've had an instance where NH messed up on something and it took me 2 days to fix. I didn't trust NH to fix it and I knew it would take too long to explain how to fix it. So I fixed it myself. Afterwards I meet with NH 1 on 1 and pointed out the mistake, said I fixed it, and banned them from messing with the program again unless they were working directly with me. NH started crying. Since then I have found out that NH started crying infront of a different co-worked. Several people have commented that NH looks like they are about to start crying talking to them. I suspect NH is getting overwhelmed and stressed. Anytime I think NH is getting overwhelmed I find a way to end the conversation and try to come back later.

77,Looking for advice about majoring in (specifically Astronautical) Aerospace Engineering,1540267138," I'm currently a high school senior interested in going into Aerospace engineering but I'm having trouble finding information that would be more applicable to the Astronautical side of it rather than the aeronautical. I'd be most interested in working at a place like SpaceX or NASA once I graduate and was wondering if there are certain universities/programs that are objectively better for that route.

I would prefer to stay in Florida as I have great scholarships here if I do, but if that wouldn't be in my best interests I'd be open to looking at other options. I've heard a lot of praise for Embry-Riddle but I'm concerned with it potentially being more focused on the aeronautical side like I mentioned earlier. Currently looking at attending UCF as it seems I'd have a lot of internship opportunities via the school and supposedly their program is decent.

Any and all advice would be extremely appreciated and if there are any details I should provide to get better information I'd be more than happy to! Thank you!

19,First year engineer who hates his classes - is there a chance I'll still enjoy working as an engineer?,1540169906,"As the title states I am a first year engineer, and I don't like any of the classes I'm taking. I find the general principles and ideas behind the engineering discipline interesting, such as problem solving and the many laws that govern the world of engineering, but working with numbers and pretty much anything we're doing in any of our classes I don't enjoy. It's not that I struggle with them, rather that I have to force myself to do the work. I know no one particularly enjoys doing assignments, but they don't interest me in the slightest. When people ask me ""what're your favorite classes kidneyretailer?"" I never have an answer.

The idea of having to force myself through the next 4 years is an exhausting thought and I can't help but think maybe this grand idea of working as an engineer isn't as I've imagined it, and that maybe my classes are a better indicator of what the profession will be like than this idea I have in my head.

Where I live, heatwaves can result in blackouts so I want to buy a generator specifically just to power this air conditioner so we don't die of heat exhaustion when summer comes.   


  
Google tells me that the load of a PC35 is 3.5kW. So in theory a 3.5kW generator should be able to power it right? I was thinking of this: [https://www.ryobi.com.au/products/details/3600w-4-stroke-petrol-generator-rgn3600b](https://www.ryobi.com.au/products/details/3600w-4-stroke-petrol-generator-rgn3600b)  


Buuuut... it's only rated for 3kW continuous load. Furthermore... I have read that electrical motors often require more juice on startup than when running at steady state. I have little doubt that my PC35 has an electrical motor to generate mechanical energy to push refrigerant around.   


So what generator spec would actually be required to get it going and power it continuously?  


  
TL;DR: Load=3.5kW @ steady state, Peak Load=???, Voltage=240V RMS, electricity is Alternating Current at 50Hz, find the generator specs to power the load on startup and at steady state continuously.

I have the values for ""extension--crosshead motion"", force, and the extensometer. I now have all the conversion factors, but I have a couple more questions:

1. to convert the extensometer values I've been given the conversion factor of ""1V = 0.05 strain on 4:1 scale"". Does this mean 4V = 0.05strain or that 1V=0.20strain? I initially assumed 4V = 0.05strain however, the values 
2. I understood the extension to just be, well, the extension: the change in length axially. However, the ""crosshead motion"" part confuses me.  But I did the math using the initial dimensions to find volume (cause volume doesn't change) and comparing it with what the dimensions would be if the height changed according to the final extension and final dimensional values and they aren't equal by a magnitude. Then you might think that crosshead motion means like a cross sectional change in radius except that these are dog bone samples so the cross sections are rectangular. 

I'm a student and this is for a lab, but the lab values were given to us by a professor straight from a tensile testing machine in volts with information scattered or not given.So I'm a little stumped.

I am conventionally attractive, I work out, dress nicely, etc. (this is not meant to be conceited, it’s just relevant to my post). I’ve been at my current job for 9 months now. When I started, I definitely got the impression that people thought I was incompetent, possibly lazy. I’ve overcome the incompetent/lazy impression with the coworkers by now, but I also interact with outside engineers, consultants, customers, etc. My industry is ~95% male. When I’ve gone to trade shows, people direct technical questions to my male coworkers while they stare at me or try to make small talk. I’ve had engineers I communicate with by phone and email who, upon meeting me, are always surprised by my appearance. I actually prefer the latter because by that point I’ve already demonstrated my competence. I purposely do not wear tight fitting clothing or makeup to work, I try to dress somewhat unattractively compared to how I dress outside of work.

This phenomenon is not exclusive to my current job either. I had a similar experience during my internship (my department was 90% males, mostly 40+) and during my first job out of college, albeit less so at that company.

The problem is outside engineers don’t trust my work from the outset of a project and I have to work against that bias. I’ve had a couple situations where I’ve had engineers ask me to consult with a male coworker because they don’t trust what I am telling them.  I’ve started responding to those situations by answering the consultant and cc’ing my male coworkers who then confirm that I am correct, rather than letting the consultant think that I am only correct because I consulted with my male coworkers first. I don’t feel discriminated against, I just get the impression that people think I can’t be all that smart/competent. 

Have other young female engineers experienced this? How did you offset this impression? Was it a constant issue? Is there a way I can demonstrate my competence to new people I work with?

60,Resources necessary to get into automation and systems engineering optimization,1540066040,"Hello all,

I’m a recent BSME graduate with an interest in controls systems in relation to industrial automation.  My mechanical undergraduate education only provided a single senior level controls class that dealt more with theory and high-level controls applications, but I really enjoyed and excelled in the class.  Ever since I finished the class, I’ve been really interested in learning more, but I’m struggling to figure out where to start.

I was wondering if anyone working in this field (in any capacity) has some advice or helpful resources for me to look at?

As a caveat, I was also curious if there are any resources that can be translated into official accreditations or certifications that would allow me to get my foot in the door with entry level jobs?  I recently got my EIT certification because I currently work in MEP, but I am looking to learn more about and eventually transition into automation at a professional level.

More school (such as a formal Masters program) is not an option for me financially, but I am willing and able to invest in my education in other ways that will jump-start my transition, and will hopefully get my resume past the “required skills filter” for interview opportunities.

61,How to safely report serious security issues safely?,1540063439,"It has come to my attention that there is a vending service at my uni that is blatantly unsafe. As a student studying engineering, I feel I have an ethical duty to report this for the well being of the public.

This vending service has a user facing touch screen and credit card reader. The card reader is a simple USB HID emulator, typing in the number scanned by the reader.

The food is behind a locked fridge door, however, the front door is held by magnets and easily swings open and gives full access to the computer running the machine. I accidentally discovered this while trying to retrieve food from the vend slot.

Looking inside, the USB ports are 100% accessible, the USB HID card reader is plugged into a usb port that is completely accessible to anyone who opens the door. Obviously a ridiculous security issue. I think this is unacceptable.

This service is run by a 3rd party, is not related to my uni at all.

### Changes to moderation policy

In the recent past I've simply locked (rather than removed) posts that break the rules. This was mainly for visibility, and I don't have a good way to see whether this has had an effect, if any, on the number of rule-breaking posts. Logically speaking it probably has little effect, since new users probably aren't going to look before going straight to the submit page. At the same time, I think it has some net positive effect for letting return users know what types of posts will get locked.

Given that most of you who are regulars don't want to see a cluttered mess of locked posts, I'm going to start removing rule-breaking posts outright. I'll also implement a stricter filter on posts by new users so we get less *""what major should I pick?""* types of posts, something we already do in r/engineering.

I was laid off a few weeks ago from my position. I had caught some heads-up from a co-workers whos friend was reached out to about my position. Then the same recruiter called me and tried to sell me my own role, without realizing I already worked there.  I confronted my boss about this and he stated, "" We sometimes put out feelers to see if we can add others. We are not looking to replace you."". About 1.5 weeks later, they laid me off. They stated they didn't think I was right for the role, and thanked me for my time there. The severance was 2-months of ""full-time"" employment status and pay with the company and a payout of all my benefits. 

Current Info:

I got a call from my former boss, and he asked if I would be interested in coming back. I initially stated I was unsure of why they would offer, considering their reason for letting me go. He said they may not have thought the decision through well enough and may have made a mistake. 

I reached out to my co-worker who told me about his friend being reached out to. He said that person actually started the Monday after I was laid off and ended up quitting because the work-load and pay were too low for what he was doing.

To me, it sounds like they need the role, but wanted to pay someone less than what they were paying me. It does not sound like the original reason they gave me is valid at all, especially if they are asking me to come back. One of the things that stood out in the responsibilities is to teach others engineers CFD and FEA simulations (I'm the only one at the office that does those things). This shows a big red flag that they want me to come back and teach someone my old job, then lay me off again. Considering the lying, deception, and general chicanery I have experienced from them following my lay-off, I am hesitant to employ with them again.

My question for engineers who have been around the block, is this something semi-normal in industry? Am I taking this to personally, as it could be ""just business""?

My mentor at work sexually assaulted me a year ago. I went to HR about harassment at that time but wasn't comfortable talking about the assault that happened outside of work.

That harassment I reported was enough for them to move him off my team and instruct him to have no contact with me. He was moved to a different building.

I've only recently become comfortable talking about the assault. I went to HR and reported it, but I have not been to the police.

I said I was worried about the company's plan to move to an open office with no assigned seats, how I'd always feel on edge.

They are open to suggestions from me as to how to handle it. What I think is off the table is asking for him to be fired, and asking for rules as strict as what a legal protective order would enforce (ie. He can't be within X feet of me, and must leave if I go somewhere he's at)

They also said that if I pursued stuff legally, that would be totally separate from HRs handling of things.

So... What kind of resolution should I seek from HR? I honestly know I'd feel scared and always on edge if he was able to come near me

&amp;#x200B;

I'm from BC, Canada and I've recently got my 4 years of Engineer In Training experience and completed all of the ethics/law requirements to apply for my Professional Designation (P.Eng). While I haven't seen it yet in the application (can't get to the final page before filling out engineering examples section), I'm fairly sure that when I get to the end, it is going to ask me what my field of practice is. For most people, this is probably the easiest questions, but for me I'm torn between putting Civil or Electrical. 

&amp;#x200B;

In University I took an Integrated Engineering program and graduated with an Applied Science in Integrated Engineering degree from UBC. Within the program I majored in Civil, but the program also dabbled in electrical, mechanical and chemical and had an overall project/project management theme. 

&amp;#x200B;

For work, I work for a power transmission line and substation company as a construction engineer and now a project manager. Most of the technical problems I encounter are civil by nature even though it is an electrical project. (ie. a transmission line is considered electrical, yet a majority of the engineering that goes into it is for the structures and foundations which is civil).

&amp;#x200B;

I've always considered myself a Civil guy and that's how I refer to myself, but I'm worried that the Engineering Review Board will see my experience as Electrical and will only approve my application if I put electrical. I know that lots of engineers change their area of practice later on in their careers, but I feel that my area of practice is somewhere between Civil and Electrical. Does anyone have any experience applying for a professional designation under similar circumstances? Furthermore, if anyone from BC knows more about the application process and Technical Competencies, it'd really appreciate it!

4,Tying new CMU foundation to old brick foundation... are my concerns valid?,1539964028,"I have a 1916 colonial style home in New Jersey. I'm getting ready to begin an addition and renovation project. One corner of the house will be getting added on to, necessitating a foundation that extends approximately 4-6 feet from the existing house/foundation. The existing foundation is a basement and the foundation walls are of a rather unique construction: two brick wythes with an air space between them with a parge coat on both the 'dirt' and interior sides.

The current plan as drawn is for this additional foundation to be a CMU crawl space. There are a couple details related to this that I could use a second (or third, etc.) opinion on.

1. The new crawl space footing is supposed to be at equal depth to the existing basement footing where the two meet, but can then step to a normal crawl space footing depth. (Given that the new foundation only ends up being ~6 feet away from existing, I'm not sure if it's practical for it to step, but that's somewhat irrelevant.)

I understand both the code and practical considerations behind this; namely that the new footing should sit on undisturbed soil or engineered fill. Is there precedent/argument for saying that 100 year old back fill is sufficiently undisturbed and that the footing could sit at a more normal crawl space depth even where adjacent to the existing foundation? If the soil tested to the appropriate bearing capacity at normal crawl space depth, is it safe to put the footing there, or are there other considerations to keep in mind? 

2. The new foundation is to be tied into the existing with epoxied dowels.

Again, this makes sense in principle, but I'm always wary of drilling into 100 year old brick (two wythes, nonetheless).

The situation I'm trying to avoid is while trying to complete these details, we end up complicating a perfectly working, albeit old and non-traditional foundation.",AskEngineers,False,lightningwill,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9pl1bz/tying_new_cmu_foundation_to_old_brick_foundation/

9,"If boat propellers are essentially airfoils, why do they not look like airplane wings?",1539960698,"When I was young, someone told me that boat propellers worked like screws, effectively screwing their way through the water something like Leonardo Da Vinci's helicopter/aerial screw design.* 

Later in life, while attending an intro to fluid mechanics lecture in college I learned that this was incorrect as boat propellers create a low pressure area in front of their blades and a high(er) pressure area behind them which essentially pulls the boat forward, creating thrust similar to how lift is created for planes when air moves over an airfoil. 

I understand that airfoils/hydrofoils are optimized for different fluids, but how can a boat propeller provide thrust [~lift] if it only has a single, 1D line as its cross section vs. how a typical airfoil on an airplane wing requires a 2D shape in its cross section in order to generate lift?** 

If this was true than it seems like airplanes could be built with flat wings exactly like how kids typically build paper airplanes and they would still fly[ish] but I know that this isn't true (without a lot of thrust), so what is going on here?

Why do boat propellers have thin, curved blades rather than fatter, oval-shaped, straight blades that look like the airfoils on planes? If this was true would it make boat propellers more efficient?***,****

I have narrowed my interests down to working in either hardware design, embedded system development, or something similar.

One of them was at a chemical plant doing Electrical and Instrumentation where I realized that is not the type of work I would like to be doing. The other one is in robotics and I loved this one.

I plan to follow her after graduation and that means I should probably start looking for jobs in Memphis during Spring '19 semester. From my light research, there doesn't seem to be too many opportunities for hardware design or embedded system design in Memphis. So, I may have to settle for another type of job that wouldn't be my favorite.

 I have multiple internships, research experience, am a coauthor on an academic paper, have a good GPA, and am team leader for senior design so I am confident that my qualifications are pretty good for most entry level positions. But, I am concerned with the transition from my first real job, which I suspect will not be in hardware design or embedded systems, to something I am more fond of. Will it be possible to switch to a different specialty later down the line if I take, lets say, a role as an E&amp;I engineer at a plant like my internship was? How difficult will this be? Am I just overthinking things and should wait until the time comes to start worrying about this? Are there any companies I should look out for in the Memphis area that may have a role that suits my desired job?

30,Mild steel coating that doesn't effect magnet and prevents rush,1539921384," Hi all,

I'm currently working on a project that is using a electromagnet to connect to a small bit of mild steel to moving something. I put a couple of coats of metal spray paint on the steel however it reduced the magnets effects pretty substantially. Can anyone recommend a good coating or finish I can apply to the steel that will help to prevent rusting while also keeping the steel magnetic ?

Colour doesn't matter and the steel will be indoors in a temperature and humidity controlled room.

As you can expect, we have no idea about electronics yet they will play THE vital role in this project.

1. How would we choose a correct supply for the motor? From researching online, we know we need a DC motor as that is apparently suitable for controls applications.
2. What exactly is the need/purpose of a power amplifier and how would we choose one?
3. We have figured out that we need absolute encoders as we need position data. But how exactly do they work and how are they wired/implemented/powered? I understand that they can give us the data we need but I cannot seem to find how to actually use one in a project/build.

43,Can anyone give me advice on beginning work as a 1099 contractor?,1539905504,"I've worked my entire career for major corporations, so everything was pretty simple: once I started, I set how much my 401k needed to have set aside and then that, my health insurance, and all of my taxes were done for me. Of course I filed my return at the end of the year, but the amount withheld was almost always right on. 

I got laid off earlier this year and one of the opportunities that I'm pretty sure is going to work out is a nearly-full-time position as a program manager.

I'd be working remotely (from my home, the company is a start-up in another city). 

My current list of to-do items is:

1. Get a federal tax ID so I'm not using my SSN for whatever things I may need it for. 
2. Open a separate account for ""my business"". There's a credit union in town that looks like they're giving pretty good interest on checking and savings, so I may do it there so I absolutely don't accidentally use my regular debit card for business expenses or vice versa. 
3. Get some kind of app for scanning every receipt and keeping track of mileage and so forth. I've heard that the regular dropbox photo scanner works pretty well for this. 
4. I am aware that I should expect to pay something like 40% of my income as self-employment and income taxes. 


There are a bunch of other things, though, that I'm not sure if I need to do. 

1. Do I need some kind of business insurance? I'm not a PE and don't intend on signing off on anything. I can give my input from my experience on things like user requirements or whatever, but it's not my intention to approve engineering documents. Or would it even make sense to register an LLC or something? I just can't think of any real situation where I'd actually hold liability for anything. 

2. As I get income, should I keep ALL of it in the business account for the year if my savings can handle it? Or do I just transfer some out and stay very aware of how much I will owe in taxes?

3. I will be purchasing a laptop and then doing business from it from the spare bedroom, probably. Since we rarely have guests, is that considered 100% utilization for business for the purposes of taxes? Am I going to have someone show up and see there's a bed and not just a desk and say I was lying?

4. Do I need some kind of business auto insurance? I may or may not be driving ~3 hours to a manufacturing site a couple times during the year. Is there any reason my personal insurance wouldn't cover an accident that happened on that trip?

5. Are there any other big pitfalls that you know of that I haven't mentioned?

Possibly (but maybe not) complicating things is that I am also in the running for a second part-time (supposedly 10-20 hours/wk, averaging 12 as I understand) position that would be in the company's office, again as a contractor. This one pays flat rate per month. I've asked the first position to also pay flat rate per month to just make things easier on everyone. 

Is there any reason that a second job is going to make things any more complex, or is it just more money going to my account that I'll have to keep track of?

I've recently bought brewsystem much larger then what I currently have (190 liter batches) and have lended the entire system to the student  brewery association at my university.

To my queation:
I will be fitting a new 10kW heater to my system and we are debating whether to use contractors or SSRs.
Contractor would switch in off every minute or so (since the thermal mass is huge) and that it will be good enough, with a model based approach to keep temperature in the desired range.

SSRs would be used and ""PWM""ed or maybe switched 10 times a minute or so to do the same.

2. ""After the successful resolution of the complaint two weeks ago and improved interaction from the customer, I recommend trying to up-sell a *x* reduced price plan with *y* benefits for *z* months.""
3. ""If a client is using at least 1 service A, an up-sell from service B will be offered.""
4. ""If client went over their data allowance more than once in the last *x* months, a larger package will be offered, provided the price difference is no higher than $X.""

The grad program focused mostly on tall buildings and seismic design but I ended up taking a job at a small structural firm.

The job is low stress, flexible hours, and they give me the opportunity to put together  construction drawings and put them through the approval process by myself. For example, I’m working on the modernization of about 5 different schools, each with multiple buildings, at the moment. I coordinate with architects and MEs and mark up the structural sheets for the CAD operator to work on, all in addition to doing the calcs.

My problem is I’m never going to be able to able to work on tall building projects working for this firm and probably never work on substantial concrete projects and very few masonry and steel projects. I’ve been thinking of moving on to a larger firm that would give me these opportunities but I’m hesitant letting go of a job that allows me to directly communicate with architects and other consultants. I don’t know if I ever want to start my own company one day but this would probably be a good start, beginning a relationship with them years ahead. I’m just unsure if a larger firm would allow me this kind of exposure at any point in my career.

So, Power plants use generators that are connected to a rotating machine like a windmill or a watermill to produce power, right? But what if instead of connecting the rotating machine directly to the generator, we connect many large cogs in a row and connect a generator to each one of them. All the cogs will rotate by one single rotating machine and each cog will power its own generator. So the result would be more electric power for the same mechanical power.

4,Help comparing 2 methods of calculating real energy consumption of an Electric Vehicle,1539801143,"Hey All,

I programmed a data logger to read information from the vehicle's BMU.  From the BMU I have \*theoretically\* 2 ways of approximating the real energy consumption of the EV.  The first is by using the vehicles state of charge and the battery's real capacity C\_real:

Battery\_Health = C\_current \[Ah\] / C\_original \[Ah\]

C\_real =  C\_ideal \[kWh\] \* Battery\_Health

E\_soc = delta\_SOC \* C\_real

where delta SOC is the change in SOC between two measurements.  

The second method is by calculating the instantaneous power, assuming its constant for a given time delta, and then summing their product:

E\_pow = V \* I \* delta\_t

E\_total = sum(E\_pow,1, E\_pow,2 ... E\_pow,n)

The two methods are roughly identical in the beginning of the test, and the second method tends to undershoots the SOC method by the end of the test.  I thought this might have to do with the 'left-handedness' of the second approximation method (assuming there were no energy regeneration for the whole trip, the real curve that describes the total energy consumption would be monotonically increasing), but i'm not sure if thats sound reasoning or not, and was hoping some of you might weigh in.   An image of the two estimations side by side over the percent of the route the vehicle has already driven is here \[example.jpg\]([https://postimg.cc/HcJ0tKvc](https://postimg.cc/HcJ0tKvc))

Just a little back story.

I am UK based and have just completed a 4 year maintenance apprenticeship with a large food manufacturer. From doing this I have gained an Electrical/Electronic HNC with lots of practical experience in automation. Prior to doing this, I studied IT and computer programming to an A level standard in college.

Hi Guys,

What are your opinions/experiences working a second shift position?

To give you a little background into my situation, I have been in the MEP/A&amp;E industry for the past 3+ years since graduating with my BSME and am trying to get out of that industry (just not really what I want to do for the rest of my career). I have had trouble getting looked at by companies, however I have had lucky getting looked at for second shift roles (manufacturing positions to be more specific) for obvious reasons and currently have some in-person interviews lined up in the coming weeks. I look at it as getting my foot into the door with companies/work I want to do, but I have a few questions regarding second shift:

1. If I were to take a second shift position, will it be hard down the road to be able to transition to a first shift position? For example, once I start a family, etc.
2. Overall, how has working second shift positively or negatively affected your life, whether that be social, health,financially, etc?
3. If you have had a similar situation moving from MEP to manufacturing (or any field to manufacturing), are there any tips or things you wish you knew when starting in the industry?
4. If you do or have worked in the defense industry (and maybe have had a similar career path as me), what has your experience been?

95,Structural Engineer to recommend repair without liability?,1539627176,"Hi Guys,

We have a sagging garage and 1-2 inch sagging of second story floor above garage.

For this reason we have a bid from a structural engineering company to recommend repair. They will only be responsible for analyzing the current situation and recommending the repair. We will have a separate company implement the fix (that company referred us to the structural engineer).

My concern is that the contract with the structural engineer effectively limits their liability to the $800 we pay them for the analysis.

That means that they could literally recommend we use a toothpick for support and they would still only be liable for $800 if the house collapses after the repair.

I asked the company directly about this and they say it's normal in the industry with this kind of liability. What I would expect would be that the structural engineer would be liable for any potential damage if their plan turns out to be inadequate.

15,"EE advice needed: Magnetically Inducted ""wirelessly powered"" LED Circuit",1539566610,"**Basics**: 

I'm prototyping a mini inductance circuit with the sole purpose to wirelessly power a 3V LED. I'm using 40g magnet wire, and \~450 tuns in the inductor (450 turns is a pretty hard limit to the design). To limit reverse current, I plan to include a diode in the circuit. 

**The gist**: I'd like to pass as much of the max voltage to the LED so that the effect of the ""wirelessly powered"" LED is that much more impressive. 

**Deeper**:

* This table on [magnetwire.biz](http://www.magnetwire.biz/magnet_wire_current.html) tells me that my 40g wire has 3.4 ohms resistence per meter, and the wire can handle a maximum current of 13.7 mA. 
* The LED I have says it can handle 20 mA. 
* On digikey, there is a diode that says forward voltage is ""[3V @ 200mA](http://rohmfs.rohm.com/en/products/databook/datasheet/discrete/diode/fast_recovery/rfu02vsm8s.pdf)"". 

My plan for a ""magnetic field generator"" is a 2mm thick N52 neodymium magnet (10mm diameter) revolving at \~300 RPM @ \~1 inch from inductor (150 RPM should produce the proper amplitude AC current, but IIUC half of the current will be in the wrong direction).

&amp;#x200B;

**THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE:** With regards to the diode specifications, I'd like to know how the diode behaves at my circuit-max current (13.7 mA): 

* do the diodes REQUIRE the stated amperage to output their stated voltage? 
* if yes, is the forward voltage of the diodes a function of the current that passes through? and how would I find out how much voltage?

**Other Questions:**

In terms of designing to the power requirements, I'd expect V = IR: where V = VmaxLED (3V), I = IminCircuit (.0137 A), giving a Req'd resistence of \~220 Ohms. Do I need to worry about limiting current somehow? 

Follow up: also, this circuit needs to be comfortably cool to the touch. If the ring was in a changing magnetic field stronger than my designed field, would there be much heat before the insulation melted and shorted the circuit? And how would I protect the circuit against that? (I don't expect there to be random mag fields anywhere near 400 gauss, but let's think worst-case scenarios).

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, my resumé boils down to this:

1. Short summer internship at aerospace company helping technicians out and reporting to engineers, nothing impressive except for the name of the company.
2. School-affiliated engineering competitive club, helped out on the sub team associated with mechanical engineers
3. At the end of my current semester I will have spent 9/12 months co-oping at a manufacturing plant.

I'm looking to leave the co-op at the end of my 2nd term for several reasons. But it boils down to a few major ones.

1. We only have an engineering team of two. One is on an indefinite leave of absence since March, and the other is cooped up in his office all day pushing paper. I am without a mentor or assistance when I attempt to tackle projects. This has greatly limited my effectiveness as an engineer and I feel has stifled my growth professionally. I work my ass off for very little to show for and I believe its because I need guidance. I feel like I would burn through projects and have better outcomes if I worked with an experienced engineer. I have expressed these feelings to management and have been responded to with indifference time and time again. The projects keep getting bigger and bigger as I tackle more and more and I'm falling further behind and getting burnt out and not really learning much.

2. I feel I have accomplished a few projects that will look really good to future employers. Now I am basically doing the same types of projects over and over with the variables just getting greater and deadlines getting tighter. Learning has hit diminishing returns and stress is at an all time high. I would be fine with this if I was a ""true"" engineer with complete training and salary, and the authority that comes with being an engineer. But as it is I'm just getting worked harder without any increase in pay, training, certifications, authority, or legitimacy as a full fledged engineer.

3. I talked about this with my school and they push engineering students to finish co-ops for the sake of getting hired. My company isn't looking to hire from co-ops and I'm not sure I'd want to work for them. My school beyond that hasn't really explained any other benefits to finishing out.

40,"[Questions][NSFW] I'm building a fuck machine, and could use some perspective all across the board to help avoid catastrophe.",1539486544,"Hello! I figured it was about time to bring degeneracy back to the sub, as some of the previous threads on the topic had some interesting suggestions, but insufficient detail to answer my questions. Unfortunately, I’m not an engineer myself, so while I can beat my head against the numbers to figure them out, I don’t have the experience or perspective to avoid probable pitfalls.

I’m failing to keep this brief, so I’ll just outline some basics in point form

Wants 
- Adjustable stroke length – I’m not talking variable holes in a wheel, I mean on the fly. Given potential use lengths (&gt;6ich) wheels or levers seem like a bad bet anyway.
- Reasonable torque/speed – Single point, because they’re related; I don’t need or want the machine to have a surplus of power and speed if it’s set to 7 inch thrusts. This made me think of steppers. 
- Arduino control – I’m a student of CPSC, so some of the stuff I want to dick about with down the road requires this; I’ve got experience with relevant problems, so I should have a decent idea of the complexity involved in software aspects, so don’t worry about that.
- I'm expecting is to be ~500, minimum, because I want to build something that's a special snowflake, but that's taking advantage of the resent surplus of parts given DIY CNC.

Basic Idea 
Simple method of generating linear motion, probably something like a timing belt, with an appropriately beefy stepper motor and belt set up to drive the necessary hardware, probably mounted on linear optical shaft, driving whatever sort of shaft you guys suggest to connect to the toy. Can keep the driving pulley size small, letting me keep a decent exchange rate in terms of torque to linear force, and I shouldn’t need too much force or speed during longer thrusts anyway.

Questions 
- Is it best to use some sort of specialized drive shaft for the final portion of the connection, i.e. the connection from drive belt to toy, or can you just get hardware to tie stuff onto a smooth shaft? I really don’t want to have a toy fall off mid use, and have to drive to the ER with a few fresh holes. 
- Technical documents seem to be lacking friction coefficients for most cheapish parts, is building the mechanical portion of the machine and using simple mechanical tests my best bet for ascertaining the precise amount of friction involved? Using general numbers with equations for friction loss to weight on optical shafts, and N required to accelerate the total mass to running velocities, reverse, etc. seems like a good place to start, but it feels like I should check in with reality before I buy a motor. Am I being paranoid here or?
- Does anyone have any experience with any of the Chinese manufacturers for midline steppers, or should I go pester a CNC board or something for stepper recommendations? I feel like if I just assume numbers are like 70% of what’s posted for N/M I should be safe, but I don’t want to be catastrophically underwhelmed by the power of my stepper. Because if that assumptions safe, there’s some stepper with numbers that would remain feasible at required speeds (Looking at OMC-StepperMotors). 
- Does anyone have any experience with cheap load cells? I’ve been tempted to stick a cheap Chinese one in somewhere, because it would give useful feedback and easily serve as a nice automatic “Oh shit abort” failsafe. I'm mostly just interested in if anyone have the experience to know if the cheap Chinese shit works, in any capacity; I trust myself to get through the lack of documentation, given I actually understand how they work, and it's seems pretty simple.
- In general, is there anything glaring I seem to be overlooking? I’m obviously new to this, so I’d prefer to call on experience to learn how to not get shanked, as opposed to learning by experience.

To address some the one obvious warning, I’m going to place appropriate emergency shutoff once I have an idea of the way the machine I’ve built wants to move, and test it extensively. I’ll decide on electrical break points, or shear pins, or hard stepper step lock, etc. once I’ve had a chance to make something and spend some time trying to break it. I’ll probably consult again after it’s built anyway, to minimize the chance something stupid happens.",AskEngineers,False,MeatSockPuppet,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9nzosx/questionsnsfw_im_building_a_fuck_machine_and/

45,Do you guys have any advice on what major to pursue?,1539477977,"TLDR; Arbitrarily picked BME because of initial interest, found interest in way too many other topics, now looking on where to go because class selection for next semester is coming up.

Hello fellow Redditors,

After reading through the disciplines thread about engineering I found I still have questions and was wondering if anyone had advice, because I'm following a bit of an atypical engineering curriculum.

I'm currently a freshman Biomedical Engineering Major fulfilling the requirements to possibly apply to medical school.

Right now I'm trying to figure out if my passion is with medicine or engineering, however either way I plan to stay an engineering major because I find engineering so interesting, it's just a matter of the end goal. 

So initially, I arbitrarily picked BME as my engineering discipline when applying because I assumed it would help me deduce what path I wanted to pursue in the future. However, through my first semester we have this class where we're exposed to the engineering disciplines and I have decided I want to change major to a different engineering discipline, while still fulfilling the pre-med curriculum.

Partly because I found the resulting BME jobs we talked about mostly had to do with medical devices and instrumentation which didn't exactly peak my interest. And also partly because I've been reading a lot about other engineering jobs and how they seem so intriguing and with a BME undergrad degree I feel like I would be have too niche a education to explore those other opportunities. 

Two other majors that seemed to interest me were Electrical engineering, and Chemical engineering. Namely because of an interest in Electronics/Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery/Fuel Cells, respectively. Then there is a whole other interest in comp sci, but I was hoping to learn some programming languages on my own time and possibly add a minor if it doesn't put too much strain on my schedule.

Anyways, I was wondering if any of you may have insight on what to do, or if you know what degree might be versatile enough to work in these interests. 

Anyways,

69,Question about a mechanical device I want to engineer,1539416752,"Hi, not sure if this is the right sub, but I'll just go for it anyway

Amazon recently released their smart plug. I have two hamsters at home, and I want to be able to feed them by saying ""Alexa, feed my hamsters"".

70,Need help debugging a glitchy electromagnet,1539414742," 

# So I've go this electromagnet that I need to work 

We built it with a 5 cm long 1 cm wide soft iron rod with around 80 turns of 24 gauge copper wire. Its wrapped in tape to keep it coiled and it runs off a DC 9 Volt battery through a simple breadboard circuit with a 100 ohm resistor. We turn it on and it generates no magnetic field whatsoever (we know this cuz we have magnetic field sensors right next to the poles during the experiment) And we don't know why it doesn't work. I've got 4 reasons why i think it wont work but id like a more professional opinion.

1. The voltage is not high enough.

2. Not enough turns.

3. The core is too wide so the power going through it isn't enough to generate a field.

4. The ampage or current is too low and doesn't generate a field.

We messed around with resistance already and ran the numbers. It should work and it doesn't. Is there anything obvious we are missing or is this just dumb.",AskEngineers,False,SkyslicerX2,/r/AskEngineers/comments/9nrybd/need_help_debugging_a_glitchy_electromagnet/

74,Mechanical Engineering major still lucrative? Or go back to accounting,1539402738,"Hello all, 

Let me start off by saying I know this might be bias to post in engineering subreddit, but I will post elsewhere for more opinions. 

I am unsure of whether to continue studying engineering (mechanical, maybe electrical?, maybe some other engineering that’s in high demand?), accounting, or choose a third major that’s within my reach. I have a few weeks to pick my major and apply to San Diego State University. SDSU, isn’t a top school for engineering but it isn’t terrible from what I hear. 
I’m more inclined to study mechanical because of my interest in moving systems, physics, and stuff like the show “how it’s made”. However, I’ve always loved tinkering with electronics and gadgets and would love to build my own musical synthesizer someday. Which engineering field seems to be more likely to hire new grads? 

For some backstory, I have the prerequisites completed for several majors due to my uncertainty of schooling in the past. I am already 25, and wasted many years. Originally thought I would study mechanical engineering and failed the first couple of years at community college due to work ethic issues at the time (not disinterest). I chose to switch to accounting and decided to turn myself around by getting only A’s -&amp;; raising my GPA to an almost honors level. Right before I was ready to transfer I got an accounting internship at a small firm and they offered me a job doing payroll. The firm was not well organized and hectic. I assumed this was all of most of the accounting world and wanted out. I decided to retake the math class I thought I couldn’t do, and that summer and got an A in Calc 2, so I went back full time for mechanical engineering. Right now I’m one semester away from transferring to SDSU for mechanical engineering but I’m getting second thoughts again. I currently have a 3.43 gpa in all coursework. 

Now my concerns. I feel like I have an equal passion in both majors (leaning towards engineering with my passion tbh) and have equal concerns about what the jobs will actually be like. Due to this, my main concern upon graduating will be getting a decent job, with a stable career, preferably as soon as possible. I feel that once I chose I will dedicate myself 100% to that major and field, I’m just torn right in the middle. 

For engineering, I do exceptionally well in math, passed with A’s in all the math classes required. I have a deep interest in physics and a desire to learn more. However, I have no idea what the jobs will be like. I’ve spoken to various people working in the field and the answers are either too broad or complex, in addition to being all over the place. There’s too many facets of engineering (specially mechanical). I’m worried I will end up in a field that isn’t as interesting as I hoped, that doesn’t bother me as much as worrying that I won’t get a job at all though. I have only taken four actual engineering courses and enjoyed them but the hardest ones are yet to come. I know I have the ability to get good grades in the classes. The biggest concern are the jobs, I hear mechanical engineering is an oversaturated field with many graduates fighting for few positions. I hear to be competitive one must work on projects outside of school and join clubs and be active in the engineering community. I would have no issue doing that and have some project ideas in mind, maybe not the money to finance them. However, It seems that doing so with the already intensive workload of engineering would likely only be doable if I wasn’t working while in school. I have already amassed some debt from my many years at community college working part time, and worried about going too deep. I know accounting is also tough but I feel that I can manage that workload while working because I won’t be in as many clubs, spending time on projects, etc. I would have no problem working in a field outside engineering after getting that degree because I hear many jobs hire them for their problem solving ability and proof of hard work. But I do not want to fight an uphill battle by competing against those with degrees in those fields though. One quote that I considered when switching originally was “you can work in business with engineering degree but you can’t work in engineering with business degree” but again that seems like an uphill battle and usually involves an MBA (which I would only get after getting a good paying job) 

For accounting, I am good with numbers and analyzing them. I have an interest in finances, tax, and think I wouldn’t mind auditing either. I picked up quickbooks fast and was enjoying the bookkeeping I was doing. However, I was worried about my ability to answer complex questions on the spot to clients about certain tax issues because of my lack of studies in the field. I do have good communication skills and know I can develop them for this. Another concern were the horror stories from working in the big4 accounting firms as well as the horror stories of accounting grads being stuck in ap/ar and bookkeeping roles that pay only $12-17 an hour. I am also worried that if I don’t pass the CPA or I don’t get public experience required for the CPA, I be working low end jobs with much lower pay and less advancement. 

Another reason I’m considering going back to accounting is because of my previous internship and payroll experience (although I hear it’s not that relevant to accounting, and only 6 months). I think it’s big that I was hired after my internship, proof I’m a worthy asset to interviewers. I think that gives me a slight upper hand in accounting but I know I can spin that in an engineering interview by saying I was a hard worker who proved to be an asset, and I learn quick, etc etc. 

I feel more of a passion in engineering but I’m honestly just seeking a decent job with security. I get anxiety thinking about fighting for a job and sending out thousands of resumes with no responses. I also fear the imminent recession hitting around the time I graduate and not sure which field gets hit the hardest, but I’m assuming accounting less so than mechanical engineering. Some other fields I considered are statistics (but I don’t want to pursue a masters before I get a job), actuarial sciences, math teacher (probably hardest to get a job), math in general, and hospitality and tourism management (big in SD but no management experience and very specific degree). I know I seem like a mess but I’ve really pulled myself together in the past few years I just am unsure of what direction fits me. 

I know you can’t choose for me, but considering all of this, would you go back to accounting or continue pushing through engineering? Are mechanical engineers hit hard during a recession? Any other engineering field flourish during recession? I know a different discipline gets hit with each recession, any guesses which ones next? How hard is it to get a job out of college? Do you think working while going to school and still participating in clubs/projects is possible? I’m scared that I won’t find an internship no matter how hard I try and that will leave me with no prospects out of school and overqualified for simple jobs. I hear San Diego is super over saturated with mechanical engineers, I’m willing to move, but does anyone know how true this is? How do you like your jobs/fields? If you did it over again would you pick mechanical engineering again? Or a different engineering, or a different career field all together? Do you know anyone who easily slid into a different career (like business) without experience, extra classes, internships, etc? Any advise for someone like me?

I feel like the engineering degree is what I want but unsure about how some of the actual jobs will be. But I feel like accounting is a safer bet for someone with my past. Is the debt to get either degree worth it, or should I work retail to pay off my current debt instead and get locked into a low level lifestyle? (Last thing I want). I’m worried about going deeper in debt and graduating almost 30 years old and not getting hired as engineer and being “overqualified” for lesser jobs, am I overthinking it? I have experience only in cashiering, retail, accounting internship and 6 months doing payroll. Is it true some older engineers have harder time finding jobs if they’re ever let go, or the company closes? Should I just push through engineering and hope things pan out? Or continuing worrying about a recession and playing it “safe” with accounting, even with the possibility of always looking back saying “what would happen if I finished engineering and actually got an engineering job”?

TL;DR: I have passion for both engineering and accounting. Engineering sounds more fun and in line with my interests, but accounting seems to be a safer bet with more security and getting a job out of school.At the same progress with both studies, but have an internship in accounting 2 years ago.

75,I was told I was overqualified for an internship,1539394794,"Well, that was weird.  


Context: I applied randomly to a few engineering internships, and got interviews for all of them. The interviews went very well, and I am still waiting on feedback from the last company I interviewed for. My GPA is a 3.1, which isn't the greatest, but I do have somewhat relevant job experience, and I'm a rising senior.

I received feedback on one, and he said I was overqualified. I currently work as an IT supervisor and on-call tech support for a small business. I do everything from website maintenance, hardware support, software support, and anything tech related to keep the store going smoothly. I also work as an online educator for a large tutoring subscription service, specializing in electrical engineering topics up to third year material. Both of these jobs are done remotely for the most part, so I can attend classes full time, and I was (of course) willing to drop them to gain real world engineering experience. (I didn't say this, but I would also be taking a major pay cut to get an engineering internship, but I thought experience was more important as I approach graduation.)

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should I do to improve myself to be appealing to employers? I'm not sure what about my experience would turn them off, so insight into that would be helpful. I'm also not socially awkward or pushy, and we were conversational and got along great.  In a way I'm flattered, but its also extremely weird to hear this feedback from an internship position.

90,Sealing around a right angle connector (electronics packaging),1539362284,"I've got an automotive project upcoming that I need to design an enclosure for.  These connectors (JAE MX47) have been mandated, and are right-angle sealed connectors for the automotive sector.  They feature a groove around the body (see images) that is ostensibly intended for sealing, but JAE (or any other manufacturer, for that matter) doesn't provide any input or recommendations on application as a matter of policy.  

This is an ECU-style enclosure, quite large, and I have also been mandated to make it able to be disassembled.  Often, ECUs will just be potted or epoxied to get the seal; I have to count on the enclosure, and I'm having trouble visualizing a way to get this connector sealed all the way around.  Basic construction, at least as I have been thinking so far, is to have a stainless plate to mount the enclosure and an ABS cover that forms the top part and seals everything up.  The geometry at the place where they join at the connector sealing grooves is tripping me up.

Has anyone got any ideas on a direction?

I'm having a slow day of work and figured I'd take a stab at creating a discussion. I love hearing other engineers stories from the field, either for troubleshooting equipment or overall project execution and almost always learn something every time. I'll share one of mine, would love to hear others.

**My story:**

I was doing an energy audit for a community college to help identify some possible energy saving measures. We found numerous energy savings opportunities, however two of our findings were the most prominent.

**Issue #1**: The staff stated that the had to run their boilers year round to provide reheat at their VAVs during the summertime or else the building would essentially freeze. What we ended up finding was that when the building was built (\~2001) the current facilities supervisor didn't understand how VAVs worked and didn't like how the ""airflows were changing"". He thought the VFDs on the supply fans of the RTUs were not operating correctly. As a result, he manually went to each VAV box, disconnected the airflow pressure tubing and locked the VAV damper positions to essentially ""balance"" the building. After 17 years of this operation, all it took was a quick site visit and report to finally fix this issue. The savings associated with this were substantial. Lesson to be learned from this? Don't forget the importance of training during project close out. You can design the best building in the world, but if the owners/staff don't understand how it is supposed to operate, it will become one of the worst buildings in a few years.

**Issue #2:** The RTUs (located in the same building, installed \~2001) were always placed in occupied mode 24/7 during the winter months as they were not heating the spaces when placed in unoccupied mode. Solution to the problem? When the unit's were installed and wired, the associated duct smoke dampers were supposed to close whenever the units were disabled. Rather than coordinate the controls and sequencing to accomplish this, the installing contractor simply provide a start/stop signal to the RTU via an end switch on the smoke dampers. Whenever the unit was commanded to unoccupied mode, the BAS would command the smoke damper closed, which would close the end switch and kill power to the unit. Solution: Remove and rewrite the sequence of operations to properly close smoke dampers when placed in unoccupied mode, however open the dampers whenever there was a call for heating. Lesson to be learned from this? Commissioning pays for itself. Get your buildings commissioned.

I mean is the level of that paper standard or not? It is not low level right. I do not want to be called a ""not good"" engineer.

I scored 34/40 in that paper. And 34 is considered great in my college. It is not a North American college by the way so it is not accredited/approved with ABET.

I noticed that we have some piping (two 5Cr valves) that are not properly rated for the service in which they are installed. The design temperature of this system is 1400F (confirmed with IR) but the piping is only rated for 1200F per ASME Sec IID. This piping is in service about once a month for an hour. At the advice of our SMEs, I recommended to management that we upgrade the system to meet code. This would require us to purchase new valves (same material) but modify the flanges and add thermal protection. This was rejected by the team and I was told that we do not have the resources to complete this work during the downtime. Instead I was told that we will install the two new valves with same material but no mods (to 'clean the slate' of any inccured damage). The reasoning was that our piping has been like this for years with no issues and we are effectively reducing risk by replacing with new valves. My concern is that we have acknowledged that we are violating code and still reinstalling the valves. I've been asked to quantify a risk of operating these valves to give to management, but there is no failure mechanism data as the operating temperature is literally off the charts. I initially tried to calculate creep damage but all of the graphs max out at 1300F.

Our engineering contractors are not comfortable with signing off on this design and neither am I. Am I making a big deal out of this?

8,Concrete Box Culvert Design Sizing and Calculations,1539310973,"Hello everyone, looking for some guidance on part of an engineering project i'm currently working on.

The project is a 21 lot subdivision in a flood zone. There is an existing open drain which I am planning to widen as an additional storage area. I am currently struggling with designing a box culvert which will be replacing a section of this newly widened drain. This culvert will go below a couple driveways and beneath a couple properties.

Some information..

The proposed drain shall have a base of 2 metres, a height of 1 metre and side slopes at 45 degrees.

For a 1 in 10 year storm event the flow going through the drain shall be 1 metre cubed / second.

For a 1 in 100 year storm event the flow going through the drain will be 3.5 metres cubed / second.

Invert level into the culvert shall have a RL of 10.60m and the invert level out shall have an invert level of 10.46m.

The length of the proposed culvert is 56.5 metres, this gives a slope of approximately 1 in 400.

The culvert will be a concrete box culvert, i am currently working using a manning value of 0.015.

I believe it will be outlet controlled, i have been instructed by council engineers that a flowrate of 0.5m cubed / sec or more will be adequate.

I have not made any decision on what would be the best inlet design, or erosion protection at the outlet.

I have been committed to studying engineering for ages now, and I’m submitting my uni application next week to study engineering. I have always really like maths and science, and have been good at both disciplines. As well as this, I’m very creative, and I love the thought of designing and creating new things, products and technology to solve problems. Sounds like I really should be an engineer, right? 😂

Well I’ve been doing some work experience with a consultant company that does finite element analysis to analyze and solve mechanical problems in the petroleum industry and honestly I’ve just been pretty put off, and after reading up on petroleum engineering, I’m honestly reconsidering engineering (no offense to petroleum engineers, everyone is into different things). I’ve been reading a petroleum engineering textbook, and have found lots of it to be analysis of small, uninteresting details of drilling wells, as well as lots of confusing formulas for random insignificant (I know that in reality these are VERY significant but they aren’t really in the scheme of my own life) things like the fluid pressure at different points in the well, etc. It honestly hasn’t been very interesting to me.

I could imagine that lots of disciplines in engineering will be similar to this, including mechanical, civil and chemical. I feel like I have an idealistic view of engineering.

The rub: I was in a meeting with some colleagues for a project yesterday. One of the senior engineers made an extremely derogatory comment about people with online engineering degrees. This has made me curious what the general perception is in industry regarding distance engineering graduates. Are they looked down on? Thought to have taken the easy way through?

40,Power Supply for Homemade Drone Docking Station,1539262052,"Hey Everyone,

My project team and I are working on a project to create a docking system for a drone that will be housed on the roof of a car. We have been working on this project for a while but the issue I'm facing is supplying power to all the components through the charging jack on the dashboard of the vehicle. 

A few components:

5 Stepper Motors: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077QHRZMW/ref=oh\_aui\_detailpage\_o05\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077QHRZMW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

**(Recommended PSU current capacity: 1.2A, Max USB Current Draw 500mA)**  


And a built-in charging platform in which the drone will land and automatically start charging through contact points. This charging platform has rating  **5V and 2A**

My intention was to use the car charger socket with those phone chargers which can draw about 39W and use that to supply the power. I guess my question is, would that be feasible, and what would be the best way to power the stepper motors and rasberry pi all at once?

Its supposed to be an incubator like this https://i.imgur.com/XTlqU2x.jpg basically a 3mm thick 5.5""x5.5""(14 cm) acrylic box, but I'm not sure If I can reach that temperature by only using 2 20W bulbs (how can I calculate the amount of bulbs needed?) or if I should use a PTC Resistor like [this one.](https://alexnld.com/product/ac-dc-50w-220v-air-constant-temperature-ptc-heating-element/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhLnm4fn63QIVmbrACh1Hug5ZEAYYAiABEgIWtPD_BwE)


The objective is to regulate the temperature inside the box from 60º to 90º C and I'm planning on using a  thermistor and an Arduino to regulate the temperature, but I'm convinced there must be an easier way. 

Also, would you change the material from acrylic to something else? Would you use  a small fan to regulate heat dispersion? And finally, how would you protect the electronics  (PCB, Arduino, electrodes) inside the box?

89,Masters in Data Science or Electrical Engineering?,1539138463," 

Hi all, 

I'm a trained Electrical Engineer from Australia with two years who moved into Secondary Teaching five years ago. Teaching had it's ups and downs, but now I'm looking to move back into a more technical role. I understand the limits of finding an Engineering job given my 5 year long hiatus from the industry. Potential employers would ask the reasonable question, ""why did you move into teaching?"" As a consequence, I was considering studying Data Science to give me a 'fresh start', as I feel there is a strong overlap with Engineering, both are mathematical and have strong analytical leanings. The alternative would be to study a Masters in Engineering, in an Electrical Engineering field which I find interest in, though I feel I would still be seen as an Engineer who left the profession rather than a newly minted Data Scientist.

Would undertaking a Masters in Data Science or Electrical Engineering be the best path for somebody like myself?

I’m curious if anyone has a made a similar jump and has advice or would be willing to talk about their career.

I’ve always been curious about how people build factories, mills, houses etc in the middle of no where with no infrastructure.

I know there are wells, generators, solar panels, satellite dishes etc. but let’s say aI want to build a factory 50 miles outside of the nearest town, do you need to pay the electrical company to run 50 miles worth of wire? And how about running water (outside of a well) etc.

Just curious about different methods that are used, I’m sure there are many.

99,Help with sound/exhaust questions!,1539122933,"Hi guys,

I've recently become intrigued with making my own exhaust. I can weld and wouldn't find this too hard however I am running in to a few issues and cant seem to find very much help on the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

My car is a classic beetle and therefore the exhaust is extremely short. I've known a few cases of burnt values and that is enough to put me off completely to not damage my engine, however I was wondering if there are ways the cold air can be prevented from entering the exhaust once the car is off?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I would like to know how to change the temperature of the exhaust when running. Is this purely down to the thickness of metal? I have heard of exhausts running so hot they damage paintwork and overheat engines. Please don't suggest heat wrapping lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally I would like to know how to achieve different sounds, less/more drone, less/more volume.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess in reality my question is, where can I read about things like this and further my knowledge in this area? I'm sure it must be out there but it seems to be very hard to find as of yet!!!
